            "answer_text": "I wrote a 30-minute score for a student film in college in about 16 hours. It used samples, so I played all the instrumental parts with keyboard. Didn't have to mess with recordings. If there weren\u2019t pressure (I was asked to write the music 24 hours before the film\u2019s festival debut), I would've spent several days on it. Maybe done some recordings on day 5/6. I imagine someone in Hollywood could manage to write and have orchestrated (they wouldn't personally do the entire orchestration) a quality and content-rich feature length score in a couple months. Get it recorded by a studio orchestra in a couple/few days. You (well, not you, the composer, unless you're Zimmer) still have to produce the culmination of the recordings and electronic sounds, as well as master all of it, which could take a week or two depending on the amount of electronic content. Finally, it needs to be edited in to the actual film by the film editor. Hopefully, the editor has something close to a final cut/version by then and no rework is necessary on the music end. So I'd guess about 10\u201314 weeks for a quality score to be integrated into a feature length Hollywood film. Much longer if it's a musical (duh). ",

            "answer_text": "Usually, the overall time takes to write a film score depends on many factors for example the type of film, music composer his overall experience and all. An experienced composer gets to comfortably write a mean of 2 minutes of music per day, scores with few instruments and lots of relaxed music can be written quicker, busy action or comedy sequences might get along slower so there might indeed be a span between 20 seconds to 10 minutes a day. However, the mean of 2 minutes per day is a good standard. Understand it with a simple example, you have a film that requires 60 minutes of music. This would signify that your composer would need around 30 full working days on it. On a 6-day week, this would indicate 5 weeks. Nevertheless, if you also wish demos, your composer will be slowed down requiring to produce them, which might end up in a mean as low as one minute of music each day. Unless you offer enough budget for him to outsource this job, you might need to be prepared for this speed. Another slowdown will be rewrites which will appear on most projects, so depending on how choosy you are, you might want to add another 1 to 2 weeks as a defense for that. ",
