            "answer_text": "You definitely asked the wrong person,I\u2019m not a fan at all. I hear most artists do a meet and greet for a charge of course usually before or after concert. Can\u2019t believe people pay exhoboriant prices to actually meet them, sometimes they don\u2019t even acknowledge people individually,try where you plan on buying your ticket if there is a meet and greet sometimes they don\u2019t advertise that. Good Luck and enjoy yourself!!! ",

            "answer_text": "sorry i didnt answer sooner. Go as press. This is probably the most effective way to get backstage passes. When artists have concerts, usually in the contract, the concert promoter is required to give comped passes to the artist. The artist uses the comped passes for friends, family, and press ",
