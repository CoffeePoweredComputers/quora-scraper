            "answer_text": "I can say about Kolkata coz dont have any knowledge about other cities and Kolkata is one of the highest exporter of musical instrument. You will surprise to know you can get a very well built high end Indian made new violin in your 9\u201310k budget. If you want old foreign made violin then you need to have a good channel with those musical instrument dealer. Now, where to buy- it\u2019s very difficult task coz you will easily get scammed if you don\u2019t have prior knowledge regarding the instrument. I have seen a lot of cases people got scraps for 9k or 10k from reputed musical instrument dealers in Kolkata. I bought few violins for my friends and for myself from a luthier who has been manufacturing violin for generations, he imports timber from Italy and makes excellent products with various price ranges. Most importantly he sells his new violin and old foreign violins as well. I am sharing his phone number. Mr. Ranjit Roy +91 033\u201324906025 +91 9231310825 ",

            "answer_text": "Please pick Rampur violins which are available in any music store. This is good to get started with the instrument. Play with it, mess with it, and at one point you'll feel you need an upgrade...Then go looking for good used German violin (you'll end up paying a bomb, but you'll never regret the decision....pick a strad copy if you can lay your hands on one. Else, pick good italian/czeck violins) If you think you're not ready to take the leap from Rampur violins to european ones, pick a good quality chinese violin (and they cost you upwards of 15k). ",
