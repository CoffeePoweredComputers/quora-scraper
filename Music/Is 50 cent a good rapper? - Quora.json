            "answer_text": "With an award cabinet that includes a Grammy Award, thirteen Billboard Music Awards, six World Music Awards, three American Music Awards and four BET Awards, it is very safe to say 50cent is a good rapper. 50 Cent was ranked the sixth-best artist of the 2000s, the third-best rapper (behind Eminem and Nelly), and Get Rich or Die Tryin' and The Massacre were ranked the 12th and 37th best albums of the decade by Billboard. Only problem is since he left Aftermath/Interscope, he finds it difficult to push his records and albums hence the drop in his album sales. He's also turned his attention to pushing the Power tv series and his vodka line.  ",
