            "answer_text": "I would argue that if you limit your library to album-based playlists, you shouldn't be using Spotify, iTunes nor any other music service is just as good, and a lot of them are free.Spotify is great to discover new music, and keeping your playlists fresh. Use some of the apps available to discover new groups, as well as the \"Related Artists\" and \"Artist Radio\" features.Have a couple of playlists to test new artists and songs, some playlists by genre and some for those albums you can't live without. Subscribe to your friends' and some of the top public playlists you like.Also, publish one of your playlists and tell all your Spotify friends about it, make it collaborative and limit your work to moderation, you'll be surprised how quickly it grows.

            "answer_text": "I listen to a lot of new music, and to full albums, so I massively use full album playlists, turning the left area in a sort of self organized library (sometimes by year, sometimes by genre, sometimes by the gnomes in my mind). On top of the list I have a heavy rotation playlist that I fill on a day by day basis (\"current obsessions\") and the public playlists I use the most to see what's new (\"new albums on spotify\", We Are Hunted, and Drowned In Sound's playlists). Screenshot here:  https://skitch.com/veronicap/fpx5p/spotify A general tip is to keep playlists short\u2014no more that 20-25 tracks. ",
