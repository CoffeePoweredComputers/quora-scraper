            "answer_text": "If it's manual car then it's really easy. Just you need to press the clutch and shift to nuetral. But make sure that your handbrake is applied or else the car could start rolling. However if it's automatic then you look in the console near the shift lever. You should see a small plastic cover; it\u2019s usually a square that blends in with its surroundings, and it might have a small slot. If you don\u2019t see it there, check your owner\u2019s manual for the location of the manual park release. Use a flathead screwdriver to carefully pry this cover off, taking care not to damage the console. Once off, put it in a safe place to avoid losing it. In the console, you will now see a small tab. Take the flathead or a key and \u2014 while pressing the brake pedal \u2014 push it down or over, depending on your vehicle. Don\u2019t apply too much pressure. Check your owner\u2019s manual to confirm which direction you should push if you feel excessive resistance. While holding the tab down, grab the shift lever as you normally would (holding in the button) and try to shift to neutral. Be sure to replace the cover and disengage the parking brake before trying to move the car anywhere. Of course, if you are manually pushing a car or have it sitting in neutral, always make sure that there is someone inside to steer or apply brakes as needed. Push the car where you need it, and once there, return the gear to park and reapply the parking brake. ",

            "answer_text": "Most automatic transmissions have a Shift Lock Release Switch located near the Shifter Knob. For a lot of cars it is covered by a small square or round plastic segment on the shifting panel -  When the cover is removed, it exposes a mechanical release button which can be depressed allowing you to shift the vehicle even if there is no key in the ignition. However, to reach it you\u2019ll often need something like a Screw Driver to fully depress the button before the shifter unlocks and shifts out of the gear it is in.  However - this is for older automatic transmission cars\u2026 there has been transition away from the Shifting Knob to the Shifting Dial over the past couple of years. For these, you will have to consult the user manual for it\u2019s location - although the function in general will be the same - use something long and slender to depress the switch/button and shift the vehicle. It is just not next to the Shifter on those vehicles. ",
