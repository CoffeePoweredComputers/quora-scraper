We\u2019ve been doing a cover of \u201cHere Comes the Sun.\u201d It\u2019s total hoot to play and always gets a semi-drunk audience up on their feet singing along with us. LOL ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve come around a little on this one: having played most of the Beatles\u2019 songs on the guitar, I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that their most fun song to play on guitar is a song I\u2019ve previously not had much time for. The vast majority of Beatles songs have fairly simple but well-articulated guitar parts, and there\u2019s not a lot of choosing between them. \u2018A Hard Day\u2019s Night\u2019 is fun, but you need more than one guitar to get the effect of that big opening chord. \u2018I Feel Fine\u2019 is a test of stamina: try playing that riff note-perfect for the whole song, preferably while singing. It\u2019s not easy. \u2018All My Loving\u2019 is regarded as just another early Beatles hit, but Lennon\u2019s triplet guitar part is another real test of stamina. I love playing \u2018Honey Pie\u2019, with its little jazzy guitar solo, but it\u2019s uncharacteristic of them. The reprise of \u2018Sgt Pepper\u2019 is fun, with those stabbing chords and the brisk pace, but it\u2019s a very short song. \u2018Strawberry Fields Forever\u2019 is impossible to play along without going out of tune, because of the way the key of the song drifts slowly upwards, thanks to all the varispeeding that took place during production. But its guitar parts are in any case not the most fun things about it. \u2018Ticket to Ride\u2019 is enjoyable, but far more enjoyable if you play it the way H\u00fcsker D\u00fc played it: through a roaring fuzzbox. \u2018I Am The Walrus\u2019 doesn\u2019t have a particularly distinguished guitar part, but it does cry out to be adapted into a solo guitar thing, with those lines in endless contrary motion. \u2018Dig A Pony\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019ve Got A Feeling\u2019 are both good fun to play, as is \u2018Let It Be\u2019, where it\u2019s a chance to play something epically tasteful during the solo. And \u2018Get Back\u2019 is just very groovy, especially for whoever gets to be Lennon and play those little C&W licks. But in the end, I think the most fun of all is \u2018Helter Skelter\u2019. Just get the tone right\u2014not too much fuzz, just enough to roar\u2014and that stabbing opening riff and the Hendrixoid chords are great fun. And the descending runs in A and E Mixolydian in the chorus are really, really fun. (\u2018Helter skelter!\u2019 Dee-nee-nee-nah-nah-nah-now!) Bonus points if you have a whammy, or a whammy pedal, so at the end of the chorus, in the pause, you can hit a low E and then bennnnnnnnd it down slightly and up again. In fact, \u2018Helter Skelter\u2019 is arguably more fun to play than it is to listen to. ",
