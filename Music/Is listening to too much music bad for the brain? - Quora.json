            "answer_text": "This question could be the subject of a series of books. Here is an outline: Part 1: Music Media Channels First, bad reproduction of music is bad for the brain. Most people ONLY listen to bad reproduction of severely over-processed music. Every knob in a recording studio generates temporal and spatial distortion, and they now use hundreds of them for all \u201cprofessional\u201d recordings and live productions. This is compounded by file compression of Internet music (MP3, AAC, streaming services), which further scrambles the sound and stunts development of neural processing for hearing, spatial perception and emotional responses to music. Consumer playback devices are overwhelmingly distorted as well. The cheaped out circuits and terrible speakers ubiquitous in phones, computers, mass market music players, televisions, desktop speakers, wireless speakers , \u201clifestyle\u201d speakers, cheap earbuds & headphones, wireless headphones, headphones with exaggerated bass (Beats), headphones with noise-cancelling circuits (Bose) all cause cognitive stress and bad chemicals in the brain or worse, permanent adaptation to the artificial sound - which is a form of brain damage. Video and movie soundtracks contain no real sound capture, it is all from post-production studios, meaning it does not match the visual scene. These unreal sounds are further degraded in cable and Internet distribution, you can only get reasonably good signal through HD antenna broadcasts, DVDs and Bluray - if the audio engineers kept their hands off the music. I recommend Bluray, HD and SACD media from \u201caudiophile\u201d websites. You may not hear the difference at first, which is a symptom of neuro-physiological brain damage from bad reproduction. It may even sound strange and unsettling, which is a healthier response; but if you keep your ears from bad sound, after a few hundred hours of high quality reproduction you will not want to go back. For example, YouTube and Spotify give me a headache in around 30 minutes. Part 2: Noise Pollution Post-industrial noise is bad for your health and mental processes, and most music listening is an ill-informed attempt to cover it over; whereas the noise degrades music rather than music beautifying noise. Music comes from silence, and needs silence as a frame. Traffic, motorized appliances and bad audio (see part 1) are un-natural sounds which prevent the development of full human hearing capacity. They also prevent sleep and learning; interfere with task concentration and social activities like conversations, humor and storytelling, and generate stress responses from both the sounds per se and the correct perception that they mask actual danger sounds. The background noise level of urban and sub-urban environments is 30dB to 60dB (a thousand to a million times the noise power) of the environments where we evolved our hearing, and has been since at least 1935 when motorized transportation, appliances and radio occupied industrial societies. Too much music listening is a symptom of post-industrial noise pollution, a crying out to stop the noise. Part 3: Architecture, Acoustics and Music Noise is exacerbated by bad architecture, interior design and acoustics. The materials of the mineral based economy make alarming sounds when struck: metal, glass, ceramics. They also resonate with high pitches which excite our programming to listen for danger. Rectangular rooms with hard, bare walls generate excessive echoes that overwhelm the articulation of speech and music. The feeling of envelopment can be reassuring - that muffling and surrounding is similar to how things sound during the first three months of hearing in the womb. \u201cImmersive sound\u201d is the latest hot trend in audio development, but it is just one more layer of artifice because it inevitably reduces the perception of consonants (how notes start, stop and transition) that are critical to the meaning of music. Part 4: Music is a Drug Music induces strong emotions with the attendant release of hormones. Live music, and particularly acoustic music can produce the greatest extremes of sadness and joy because it is interactive and connects humans more strongly and positively than any other activity. In a season of curated Classical music subscription concerts, one can expect one or two evenings of extreme euphoria, which leaves a sort of hangover the next day. It is a good and healthy feeling, but not optimal for high-function tasks. If you could string together two or three such concerts, say over four hours of music, it could well be too much unless it is calibrated into a structure with a few peaks. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello there, in my opinion and keep in mind it's only my opinion, music is not bad for the brain, nor is listening to it too much, at extreme volumes and prolonged exposure yes of course it can damage your ears but that's why we hopefully are listening at medium/balanced levels.Music has been known to stimulate the brain and also ones sense of time, beat, rhythm and overall brain capacity and even activate certain sections of the brain.It's no wonder that musicians, many times are said to use more of their brains abilities than other \"ordinary\" people.Not saying its something supernatural or paranormal, it's just that music has so many different intricacies from lyrics, patterns, sounds and more that you could literally spend an entire lifetime on just one instrument alone and it still wouldn't be enough for mastery.With that said. Music is a world of boundless possibilities and for me, a drummer of 10 years, playing since I was 13, I'm now 23 I can say it's one of the most rewarding things in life, aside from food and video games of course.Music is great for you. :] ",
