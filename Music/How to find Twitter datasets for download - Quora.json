There are many tools (free and paid) although nothing was enough so I made my own tool that uses web mining and some other APIs. Finally I have made that tool online. http://www.orgneat.com It uses some existing database I have plus data from twitter public threads and gives you result in CSV. I am also working on NLP (Sentiment, Classification, Topic etc) and will add to it. There are many answers to this question, though appreciate few, others are just to promote their tool here. The tool I made completely runs on my own computer and is free for any academic/research work. ",
