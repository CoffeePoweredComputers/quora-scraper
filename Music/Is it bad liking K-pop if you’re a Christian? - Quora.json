            "answer_text": "Do you have a problem liking K-pop and being a Christian? This is a personal thing that doesn\u2019t have a right answer, or I guess the right answer is that if K-pop is elevated to a higher position that God, or if it causes you to ignore your neighbor then yes it is bad, but if K-pop helps you to connect with people and show the Love of Christ to them then it is not only acceptable, but good. All questions of what is right or what is wrong as a Christian falls into the categories of helping you love God and love others or preventing you from loving God and others. You are the only one who can answer that. ",

One of the things I like is that I can\u2019t tell if the lyrics are bad or not since they are not in English! The videos get a little racy for my taste, so I would suggest staying away from them. ",
