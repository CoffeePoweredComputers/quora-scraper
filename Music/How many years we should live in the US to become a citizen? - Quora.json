As long as you follow our laws and remember certain dates on the calendar for each step in the process, it shouldn\u2019t take more than 6 months to 1 year. But this can depend on many different things happening. If you don\u2019t have certain legal documents, you will be waiting until you get them. If you decide to come here for the welfare benefits of the poor: monthly check (not as generous as you think once you get here and have to pay for things), food stamps and medical and housing, it can take a VERY, VERY long time. If you bring a business or plans to start or purchase a business, it goes much, much faster. Because you are not burdening the system which is already like a lifeboat with too many people in it. Because you are coming here to be a responsible citizen. If you come here as a student and decide to stay, it can get tricky if you don\u2019t file the correct paperwork first or lie about something. The feds will find out, trust me. In fact, the feds will find out if any immigrant hides criminal behavior or other important facts about their life in another country. Yes, there is asylum. But you really, really, really don\u2019t want to lie about that either. It will bite you where you sit down later. Hard. Here is a link you can go to to verify what I\u2019m saying and to find out other important facts about immigration and naturalization. How Long Does it Take to Become a U.S. Citizen? ",

            "answer_text": "Time spent in the US has nothing to do with being an American citizen. You could have spent decades in the US and not be a citizen, or never have set foot in the US in your life and have US citizenship. If you want to become a naturalized US citizen, you have to have had a US green card for at least five years.[1] In the five years before filing for citizenship, you have to have physically spent at least thirty months in the US, and you have to have had continuous residence in the US for the full five years as well. Additionally, you need to have lived in the state you\u2019re applying for naturalization in for at least three months. Because you have to wait five years between getting a green card and getting citizenship, and given that green cards themselves can be hard to get, naturalization can take many years. That\u2019s especially true for people from countries with a lot of citizens who want US permanent residency;[2]over 200,000 Indians will likely die while waiting for their green cards.[3] Footnotes[1] Naturalization Information[2] Green card gridlock: When will Congress agree on a solution? - Roll Call[3] For over 200,000 Indians, the wait for a green card is longer than their lifetimes",
