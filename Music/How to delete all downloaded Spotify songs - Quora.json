Crtl A will highlight the entire list of files in a foler. Then press delete and they\u2019re all gone. If you want to delete everything, right click the folder and delete everything it in at once. It\u2019s against the rules to download Spotify music. You may just have a playlist that is a link to the songs. If the music is on your computer, then it will be a bunch of large audio files. When you click on one, does it play in a player or does it take you to a playlist that Spotify streams to you? ",
