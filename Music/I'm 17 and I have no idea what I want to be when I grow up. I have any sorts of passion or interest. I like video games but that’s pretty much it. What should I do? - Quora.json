            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a sucky world where everyone expects you to have your life figured out at 17/18. You\u2019re young, your brain isn\u2019t even done molding itself yet, and the person you are now is going to be vastly different from who you will be in ten years. Ten years ago, when I was 17, I wanted to be a journalist. I liked reading, and I liked writing, and I figured that journalism was a good path to allow me to do both. Now, I have a BFA and an MFA in English, and work in marketing. There were a lot of twists and turns that lead me here, but I\u2019m absolutely not where I thought I was going to be when I was 17. My advice? Take it easy on yourself. You like video games? What do you like best about them? Try to isolate that and explore it further. Maybe take some community college courses on writing and design to see if you like it. Or go into a trade (like plumbing/electrican/etc) and work so you can go home and play video games at the end of the day. No matter what you do, remember that paths can change and you might discover something that strikes some passion in you. And if not, there\u2019s nothing wrong with living for the little things. My greatest joy at the end of the day is walking my dog while listening to music with the knowledge that when I get home I get to play more DOOM. (That\u2019s another thing I\u2019m going to give you some advice on - at some point, people are going to tell you that you\u2019re too old to do things or explore your interests or have fun. They\u2019re all wrong, every single one of them. Find your joys and stick with them. Do the things you never got to do as a kid. I just bought a gameboy color because mine got stolen when I was young and now I work a big-kid job and can afford it. I still love Pokemon and going overboard for Halloween. But I went through a phase when I was 20 when I got rid of a bunch of stuff because I thought that\u2019s what adults did, and I\u2019m sad for my younger self in doing something that was so detrimental to my mental health simply because society told me I had to be a grown-up and throw all my toys away. Keep your toys, and don\u2019t let the flame of your childhood burn out. It\u2019s okay to let it get low, just remember to stoke the coals so it can keep you warm.) ",

            "answer_text": "I, at 17, didn't know what I wanted to do either. I graduated from high school at 17, and my father had bought a service station at a freeway exit, supposedly for my older brother and I to have a job. When my brother went in the military (Vietnam War) my father sold the station (I guess it was more for my brother. Lol), but not long after that I too joined the military. It was a great decision for me, and I spent 13 years in the military until my disabilities (Vietnam War) prevented me from continuing my career. I'm not saying join the military, but check out all the branches, see the jobs/careers they have to offer, and you could wind up being trained in something you may love! What got me into the field of education, was being the person in charge of training in almost every duty station I was transferred to, and I loved it! The job I did while in the military dealt with Top Secret stuff, so that actual job did not transfer over in the civilan world, but the training part stuck with me, and from there, using my GI Bill, I went to college, and got my degrees which set me up to be a counselor and an educator, and the rest is history! The military may not be for you, but if you dont check it out, you will never know. There are a lot of jobs in all branches that have absolutely nothing to do with guns, and you may find something you absolutely love, do 20\u201330 years, and then turn right around and still be young enough to start a second round, doing the same thing except for more money, while getting a pay check from the military for the rest of your life! Just a thought. Go check it out, and make sure anything the recruiter promises you is in writing! Good luck in whatever you decide! ",
