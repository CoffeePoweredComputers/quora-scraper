            "answer_text": "Well, there could be a multitude of reasons for this. For one, when rap artists make an album, they are generally trying to put together a collection of songs with a cohesive sound. Sometimes in the recording process they may create songs that don't necessarily correlate with the sound they are going for. So, they may decide to put out those songs as singles separately from the album, before or after its release. Another reason is, not every song a rapper records is going to be of album quality. Rappers record tons of throwaway songs and sometimes they release those to maintain their buzz/status when in between albums. In the case of 0 to 100 by Drake, this was a song he released after Nothing Was The Same. It may have been a song he recorded during the process and he felt didn't really fit on NWTS. Or, he may have just recorded it afterwards in the post-album hype and decided it was too fire to hold out for any future project. Another aspect which may come into play is issues with label/sample clearance, etc. Artists deal with this stuff all the time but I am not going to go into all of that or I'd be typing all night. Anyways, hope that explains it for the most part. Rappers are kind of unpredictable so if none of those reasons fit then maybe they just didn't feel like putting the song on the album\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Rappers aren't the only ones that do this, pop artists do too, and I'm sure other types of artists do too. Sometimes artists don't have time to make more than one song that can be released to the public, but they want to give their fans something new, and then by the time they are ready for a whole new album, they want all new songs for the fans, so they don't include that one single that they came out with earlier, or they decide to go in a different direction with the album theme. This was the case with Ariana Grande's song Focus, which wasn't included on her Dangerous Woman album. ",
