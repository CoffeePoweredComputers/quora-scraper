            "answer_text": "Networking is important. Cotillions (dances), summer camps for like-minded kids, private school where other rich families attend. Expensive afterschool activities help ensure that like-minded people participate in it. They encourage socialization if it's with the \"right people.\" Contrast this to middle class values that say you should study hard, try your best, and work to get ahead.  This value on play and networking is why rich guys and girls look like they have \"arrested development.\" Paris Hilton looked spoiled and immature.  The Kardashian/Jenner clan looks the same. But they attend designer fashion shows, they date shipping moguls and rap moguls, they befriend other rich people, they get endorsement deals. Their form of play pays better than the middle-class form of work.  Golf is another example of this concept. Companies make deals over golf because it is a wealthy sport, a \"fun\" pursuit, and promotes networking. Even better if you fly on a jet to the golf course. A middle class mindset would say it's a waste of money, and the deal should be done in a conference room. Status symbols are important. One-of-a-kind items, exclusivity. Sometimes this looks wasteful to the middle class. One wealthy neighborhood got into the habit of buying golf carts to drive a half-mile to the neighborhood club house (there was no golf course!) It was a golf cart for the sake of having a golf cart. Thousand dollar dogs are another example. Middle-class people insist that you give a dog a good home, and find one at the SPCA.  Rich people talk about how they got their dog to their specifications. Also, thry drop the dog off to doggy daycare. I remember calculating that a rich family I knew spent more on doggy daycare than most people spend on monthly cable, cellphones, or the electricity bill.  People in their homes is another big thing. Poor people want a home (they live in an apartment, or worry about foreclosure.) Middle class people feel their small home is their castle, and don't let people in except as guests visiting. Rich people hire people to traipse through their house. I was tutoring a rich kid, and the gardener was in the back yard. I dated a wealthy young guy, and his parents had six people from a catering company in their kitchen, hosting a dinner party in the main parlor.   It's like Downton Abbey, which has servants quarters and a ladies-maid who dresses you in your own bedroom. Servants are a part of wealthy lifestyles. They actually publish articles about how Prince William and Dutchess Kate don't have too many nannies for their children. Children are paid for by their parents. Poor people can afford you til your 18. Middle class people try to pay for college - your spending money might be on you. Rich people pay for their college-aged kids to fly to Hawaii, fly to conferences, fly to ski trips over Winter Break. The kids can live in the family mansion longer than is comfortable for middle class people. Part of this is that it allows the child to keep networking, because they can afford opportunities to meet others.  Exclusivity is important.  I knew a 25 year old rich kid living with his parents, in a social circle of other 25 year olds with jobs living with their parents. (It was the Recession so living with parents was more common, but overall it's looked down upon in America.) Back to the story: The 25-year-old, probably insecure that his friends lived in their parents' mansions while he lived in his parents' waterside condo, bragged to me that he lived in a gated community.  That is an upper-class value, one that middle class folks think is douchy. What made it funnier was that he had just moved to the area of the city, whereas I lived there my whole life. I asked follow-up questions, and realized he didn't live in the fanciest housing development within the neighborhood, and by \"gated community\" he may have meant a small two foot fence that isn't enclosed. (Roll eyes.)  Did I mention he lives with his parents, so he didn't earn that housing situation himself? He was trying to impress me using upper class values, but I'm a lower middle-class girl who wound up in the conversation because I'm academically impressive. I've been the hired help for rich people, then I dated a rich boy in the same social circle I worked. It was uncomfortable watching his values expressed, and we broke up, in large part, due to differences on how we treated/viewed/spent money.  He spent family money to show off (no harm done, they didn't mind), and I told him he needed to grow up and take ownership for himself. He was owned by his parents' money, by his room in their house, by their spending habits. He needed to grow up and \"rough it\" on his own to gain maturity and independence. When he spoke of applying to college, a $40,000 a year private college, he said \"we applied.\" As in, him AND his family handled the process, versus the middle-class parents encouraging their child to apply, or the poor kid handling the process all on their own. Must be nice having the system 'rigged' like that. :-(  ",
