            "answer_text": "My first piece of advice is if possible, wait until you're more financially stable in the future, and maybe just rent a cheap one for now. $200 won't really get you that good of a violin, and I was lucky to get a good one for $1200. If not, then I wish you the best of luck in finding that violin that suits you. The most important thing for having a good projecting sound of course is to practice! If you don't practice, you'll sound bad, no matter how good the violin is. Violin shopping can take quite a while, depending on your luck. Ask your violin teachers for about 4 or 5 shops that are reliable and trustworthy. If you don't have a teacher, I would search some shops up on Google Maps. (Make sure to read the reviews!) Now, I actually shopped for a new violin in August, and this method worked best for me: 1.) Start with 2 violins. (Be sure to use the same bow! If testing bows, use the same violin). Play something easy so that you won't have to focus on playing it correctly, but make sure there's a good range of notes. I would try playing a G Major scale 3 octaves and I would shift to 3rd position on the G String to see if the violin can handle it. 2.) As you play, don't focus on playing correctly, as you're testing violins, not showing off. 3.) Retain a constant amount of pressure on the string with the bow, and use the same amount of pressure on the different violins. If you play the violins differently, it will be harder to tell which is better. 4.) After comparing the 2 violins, pick the one you prefer. 5.) Basically, ask the shop for all the violins within the budget, and test them out in a tournament style. 6.) Once you get down to about 4 or 5 violins, Play one and compare it to the others. If it's worse than 2 of them, then don't buy it 7.) Repeat step 6 until you narrow it down to the top 2 violins. 8.) Most shops let you borrow their violins for about a week for free, so ask them if you can borrow them, and you'll just have to sign a few papers and you're done! 9.) Repeat previous steps with about 3-4 more shops. 10.) Play the different violins while you practice. Maybe use 1 violin one day, then a different violin the next. Personally, I used a different violin each practice session. The better ones should stand out! 11.) At your next violin lesson, compare the violins the same way as you did at the shops. However, it's likely that there will be some bias. Have your teacher (or someone that plays the violin) test out the violins that you brought for testing. 12.) Make sure that it's a blind test when you hear the other person playing. Just list the violins as #1, #2, etc. 13.) Once the other person plays all of the violins, list your top 2 or 3 violins. (Make sure that you don't know which is which!) 14.) Now compare these violins and pick the one that best fits you. 15.) A very important thing to note while violin shopping is that you should pick the violin that best suits you! It is important to take others\u2019 opinions into consideration, but your own judgement is most important in the end. 16.) When playing and testing out the violins, don't get distracted. Focus on how the violin sounds, the projection, tonal quality, and it's range. Make sure that it can handle higher positions! All violins sound good at 1st position. This is what worked best for me when I was searching for my own violin, and I really love my current instrument. Personally, if I were you, I would just rent a cheap instrument until I were more financially stable, but I can't control your life, can I? Hope this answer helped you find an instrument you love, and good luck! (P.S. Use the same method when searching for a bow. If you want to know what to look for in a good bow, just ask me in a comment and I'll edit it in). ",

            "answer_text": "A lot of people are real snobs about violins. Just realize that 200\u2013300 USD is going to be what it costs for a decent beginner violin that can project it\u2019s tone, has good intonation, and stay in tune. You can do just fine with such an instrument for years. Don\u2019t get too hung up on tone and getting a fine, pristine instrument. What you should do, is find someone to help you choose one in your price range. Then work hard, practice every day, and have fun playing. ",
