            "answer_text": "Spotify! Not so much Applemusic. The former has playlists based on genres of new artists that deserve a good look. Many interesting radio stations have online sites where you can check to see what that song was at 10:44 pm last night. Interesting radio stations? University campus radio stations, short range but if you have a school or community college nearby they will have a website where you can check out their playlists also. Satellite radio is okay but at least you can see who the artist is and the name of the song onscreen. I play guitar and I\u2019ve heard a song come on car radio and I want it, I record a bit of it on my cellphone, there are ways to identify it later. I\u2019ve got an old Mac with an app called Frostwire to download songs for my iPhone. These are still around and they promote up and coming artists on occasion. Or enter a name that you\u2019ve heard or a title and you\u2019re off! The downside to Spotify besides money involved is that you will have so much music to sort through, 100 songs and next month comes up and you have to pay but you haven\u2019t gotten through last month\u2019s playlist! First world problems! ",
