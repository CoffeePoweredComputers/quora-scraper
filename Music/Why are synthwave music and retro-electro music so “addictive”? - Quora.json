            "answer_text": "I think it\u2019s a sense of fantasy and escapism that comes with the genres. It\u2019s the same reason people like Steampunk. It\u2019s a re-imagined and idealized version of what once was presented in a way of what could have been. Personally, I find something so dreamy and calming about 80\u2019s Revival music. A lot of people were raised hearing music from the past few 50 years or so, and so these genres also just mean a lot to them and touch on their memories of growing up and so they get a sense of nostalgia about it as well, which makes it \u201caddicting\u201d to the listener. Sidenote: Thank you for linking to Quixotic! I\u2019ve never heard of them before.. I\u2019m adding that song to my synthwave/vaporwave/80s playlist :P. Since you like Synthwave, if you haven\u2019t heard of them already, you might like Myzica. They aren\u2019t too well known. Also, I can\u2019t stop listening to this song lately. ",

            "answer_text": "First off I want to say I am not a fan of the whole genre, but some of the music and songs made in this style can very addictive. Songs like FM Attacks \u201cStranger\u201d \u201cMy Life\u201d \u201cMagic\u201d or \u201cFireflies\u201d by Spire Wolf , have that bright, optimistic \u201cChristmassy\u201d sound. Layers upon layers of different 1980s synth sounds, many times overlapping each other but bouncing off and playing off each other in harmony. There is just no other genre capable of such harmonies. The female vocals in \u201cStranger\u201d is very seductive, feminine and heartfelt. The melodies are of prime importance, not like early 1990s techno music which is only stronger beats and bass given the utmost importance, kind like a jaded feeling decade to me. For the 1980s sounds pop-ish sounds, there is a trippy happy playful sheen to them. ",
