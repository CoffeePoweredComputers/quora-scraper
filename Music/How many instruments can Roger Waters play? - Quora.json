Curiously enough, according to Wikipedia there\u2019s no mention of him playing trumpet or keyboards (nor any mention of his \u2018barely being able to play bass\u2019 - but that appears to be evident from comments by fellow bandmates such as the guitarist).

(many of the better bass-moments on PF records was done by Dave, remember that cool fretless bit from The Wall?\u2026that\u2019s Dave)) He can probably play guitar like your uncle at the beach. Great conceptualist though. ",
