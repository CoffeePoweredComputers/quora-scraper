            "answer_text": "Why?? If you think you are well educated enough and smart enough to go get your GED.. then apply yourself and go take the state proficiency test and just graduate early. Here is the thing.. that state proficiency test to graduate is equal in difficulty as the GED. And upon passing you actually get your diploma..not the GED . I passed at 16.. and was out of high school and went to college. Was not that hard. I passed in the upper 98 percentile. Let me tell you how employers and college looks at a GED of a younger person. You are not motivated nor dedicated enough to see things through. You are a quitter. That may seem rough or harsh and even bias..but in 99 % plus of all cases it is the truth. Now let's say you get out and take the proficiency test and graduate early.. well that tells others you apply yourself to be above the curve, your intelligent and further ahead than those at your normal age. It also means you are more than capable of applying yourself. You have a strong will and will set your mind to not just accomplish a task but capable to try to get it done in a tiny manner or ahead of time. You need to understand why you want out of school so early. If it it is not to further your education and truly better yourself. And or even just to stop going to school because you do not want to learn..then you have no business trying to get out eay..you just prove your intectuslly lazy.and unmotivated. If you think you are well educated enough to graduate early\u2026prove it..go for the state proficiency test..graduate early.. show your capable.. Your parents will most likely agree to that and if you pass you prove everything you set out to prove to yourself and others. As said I passed sometime just after I turned 16 and showed everyone why I was ready to move on and not be stuck in classes with those around me less capable. I knew the subjects already. I did not need to learn them again. Or be held back from really learning what I wanted to learn and learn at a level that suited me as an individual. I was ready. I proved it and that shocked many people because they thought my lack of motivation in high school was laziness..but it was boredom and disinterest. I already knew what they had to teach. By the time most kids my age was graduating HS I was already over 2 years into college and had been holding my own job for several years. Part of school is to help prepare you for real world life . If you have not gained that education and the necessity scholastic education needed for life and a well rounded knowledge. You have no place trying to leave early. ",

            "answer_text": "Since I was a2a, a GED is not a badge of honor, while it is better than nothing, it is an indicator of not being able to follow through. Doing what needs to be done is a sign of character. More importantly, the IQ of an individual is commonly set at about the age of 20, and beyond genetic predisposition (inherited intelligence possibilities), experience consisting primarily of education is the only factor predicting how intelligent an individual will be at the peak of their IQ (Dean, 2020). Unfortunately, online schooling is the only avenue available; therefore, you have in your power the ability to make the most of a less than desirable situation, or accept the probability that not doing so will affect all of the remaining years of your life. The difference between what we find good or bad in some cases comes down to attitude: Dan Robb's answer to How do I switch from a unmotivated defeated mindset to a positive and productive mindset? Since I was a2a, attitude can become a habit that one automatically resorts to (i.e., a subconscious response to stimulus), positive or negative. However, Schlessinger (1996), a marriage and family therapist, indicated that when one experiences negative feelings one can still choose to adjust their attitude, and recommended acting \u201cas if\u201d positive feelings were present. Moreover, the psychological concept of Self-Fulfilling Prophesy accentuates the impact of how thought/attitude influences outcome, for better or worse (Using Self-Fulfilling Prophecies to Your Advantage) ",
