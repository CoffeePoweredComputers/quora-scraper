            "answer_text": "I think that Miley Cyrus, although she comes with a lot of different phases in her life that she has gone through in the public eye she has always been a very smart and Caring person. In 2008 she released a song called Wake Up America, one of the only 15 year old girls that I have ever seen given a rats ass about global warming and the environment and actually cared enough to raise awareness towards the issue knowing her huge audience she had. From there she has donated to 51 different charities (large amounts of 500,000 most of the time). There are a bunch of videos of her talking to the young kids at her meet and greets, visiting children hospitals, helping in Haiti (and I mean physically helping) with Starkey to plant hearing aids to the kids that had lost them in a natural disaster. One of the doctors from one of the childrens hospitals in LA actually spoke up about how much Miley truly cares by saying that \u2018A lot of celebrities come in with their camera crew go to 2\u20133 rooms, get photos with the kids then get on their way but Miley comes in very often, most of the time without cameras following, visits lots of rooms each times and actually spends times with the kids, sings them songs and entertains them\u2019. She also has her own Non-profit organisation Happy Hippie which focuses on homeless youth of all kinds and helps raise awareness and donated large sums of food and clothing to the homeless shelters around LA. I Think that she is a very compassionate person who truly cares about the world. I also think she's is extremely down to earth. Aside from her public image or should I say previous public image (I font actually think people have as strong opinions on Miley as much as they did in 2013), there has never been a negative thing spoken about Miley from someone who actually knows her well enough to make a informed comment.

The problem is that she\u2019s not that sweet, perfect little girl we used to believe she is. Sure, she\u2019s more naked than dressed and her performances can be pretty awful but that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s bad person. She\u2019s not money and power hungry like 90% of Hollywood. She\u2019s helping sick children and adores animals. I don\u2019t know, I just can\u2019t say that she\u2019s bad person. ",
