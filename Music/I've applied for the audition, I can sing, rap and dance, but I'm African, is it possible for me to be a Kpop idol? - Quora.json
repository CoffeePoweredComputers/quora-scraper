            "answer_text": "As an African myself, you can audition if you want. But just to let you know, the chances are very slim for international trainees. There are some obstacles to watch out for: Racism: Korean and international netizens are known to be quite controversial when it comes to K-pop (in other words, flat out racist). K-pop netizens are used to seeing pale, clean faces, small faces, and sharp noses. To them, seeing a dark or tanned-skin idol would kinda collapse the whole Korean beauty standard. Which leads us to: Bullying: Looking back from what I have stated earlier, this will easily count as bullying and discrimination. In fact, K-pop artists such as Sulli from f(x) committed suicide due to bullying. People with almost no Asian ethnicity will definitely find the experience 10 times worse than the average K-pop trainee. In addition, trainees will also have to deal with paying a large debt for housing (and paying the company), as well as sasaengs (obsessed K-fans), and not getting the chance to debut after the course of a couple of years. If you do want to become an artist, it is easier to do so in your own country since you can also be as famous worldwide in the right record (Atlantic, Interscope, Republic, etc.). Now I\u2019m not saying to not audition for a Korean company, but if your heart is sought out on this job, YOU GO GIRL! I wish you the best, and if you don\u2019t get in, there are other companies to try out for. Here are some suggestions: Fantagio EntertainmentWoolim EntertainmentWM EntertainmentRainbowbridge World EntertainmentBlockberry Creative",

Don't care what people say! I will always support you no matter what. People might discriminate but it'll end soon ~~ I believe in you. Un-sugarcoated flat out no. Koreans AND INTERNATIONAL FANS are known to be racist. Before y'all international fans start screaming look at UHSN, a totally WHITE group. They received a lot of backlash and  Yeah. We\u2019re not as welcoming as you think. Some of us anyways. May I add that in South Korea, assuming that your a trainee, the chances of you committing suicide from school bullying is almost guaranteed unless you have an iron clad heart? A korean teenager commits suicide over bullying every day. korean. Your not korean- even worse. Your not even asian. Not trying to stereotype koreans, but I can already see the entire highschool mocking you. Ah yes, us fanfiction readers. \u201cOne girl will show up and help us!\u201d or \u201ca hot oppa will find you pitiful\u201d thing is, that really doesn't happen as often as our fanficitons suggests. Assuming that- wow, your amazing and debuted. Sulli devastated me, and I do NOT want another idol to commit suicide. You'll recieve endless hate from all around this half cursed planet. I know, I can see all the comments like \u201cNot all of us are like that! Your being too harsh!\u201d. First, sweetie this says unsugarcoated version. Second, if your not like that, someone else is. If you want to be a singer do it at your own country. Peace \u270c\ufe0f ",
