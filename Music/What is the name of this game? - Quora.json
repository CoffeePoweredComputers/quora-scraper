            "answer_text": "I don't know which game you're thinking about but a little bit more context can make this easier to answer. Are the cars you previously drove transparent, and allow you to drive through them? Is the objective to drive as fast as possible or as safely as possible? Is there a time limit? What is the theme? Are you a Taxi driver, a car thief? Are the cars all the same or all different? What system is the game for? PC, PS4, Xbox? If you can provide some more details, even if they seem insignificant you will have a much better chance of getting an answer but the information you provided is very limited. ",
