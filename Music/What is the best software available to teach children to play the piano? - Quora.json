            "answer_text": "The answer you may be seeking may not be the best answer to this question. What I mean by that is this: The ears of a human being are the best tools to use to teach children to play music of any sort, including the piano. Here are steps to take to teach children to play an instrument, including the piano:  Play lots of music, varied music, all kinds of music, all kinds of melodies so your child can listen and love the sound of music.Provide an instrument or two or three capable of replicating melody. These could include a piano, a harmonica, a kazoo, a voice, lips pursed in a whistle, a recorder, flute, guitar, violin, viola, cello, clarinet, etc.Spend time with children asking them to sound out the melodies they know and love. Use trial and error, and also let them be alone with their instrument as soon as they seem mesmerized by finding the melody. Be nearby to help if you can when frustration sets in -- or provide a teacher when the child asks to learn.If you really want to go the software route, I did a Google search for 'software teach piano' and came up with many, many options. Among them: eMedia Piano and Keyboard Method. This looks to me as good as any -- but remember that the joy of music is in discovery and creativity. Direct instruction can sometimes create a child who is less keen on playing, and more interested in ending the lesson so s/he can have fun and play (with friends, outside, creatively -- whatever does not require sitting still and meeting some seemingly arbitrary standards). Remember that children learn best when they play. Adults, too.",
