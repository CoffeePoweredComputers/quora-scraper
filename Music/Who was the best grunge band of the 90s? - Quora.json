            "answer_text": "Now, aside from Stone Temple Pilots, I\u2019m a fan of all 5 \u201cbig\u201d grunge bands. I won\u2019t straight up declare a \u201cbest\u201d band because that would result in an ostensibly inaccurate conjecture. There\u2019s no such thing as a best work of art, and the same principle applies for every artistic venue. From a vocal perspective, I\u2019d consider AIC and Soundgarden to be immensely strong for their respective reasons. Chris Cornell has an exquisite voice with an impeccable range and Layne Staley\u2019s haunting growls and belting howls will induce goosebumps and shivers. Cornell is still alive and well, singing as good as he did in the past albeit with a more limited range due to inevitable degradation of vocal strength as a result of the aging process. Layne Staley is still as dead as he was back in 2002, the year his long duration of pure agony came to a halt. Let\u2019s not forget AIC\u2019s guitarist and backing vocalist Jerry Cantrell, his voice is soothing and heavenly when layered with Layne\u2019s legendary vocal capacity. Kurt Cobain is a middling vocalist with unsettling screams, that\u2019s about it. Eddie Vedder has a nice, clear voice but his range is pathetically chained to baritone. Nirvana wins in the bass department. Krist Novoselic is undoubtedly the god of grunge bassists. Don\u2019t let his famous \u201cbass to the face\u201d debacle fool you, his bass lines are god\u2019s gift to Nirvana. Dun dununun dununun duun dun dun dun. All apologies, here I go yet again humming the bassline in \u201cLounge Act\u201d for all eternity. Alice In Chains is the most versatile band of the five. They\u2019ve dabbled in bluesy sounds, grunge, pure metal, pop rock, and other genres. There\u2019s a song for everyone within their discography. In a nutshell, they\u2019ve got a varied sound. Nirvana is what I\u2019d consider to be pure grunge. They got the aesthetic, the agonizing screams, the heart wrenching lyrical whims of an artist crushed under mountains of anguish, distorted guitars, and a fusion of energetic and drained melodies. They\u2019re essentially The Beatles drenched in suffocating pools of sorrow, reeking of \u201cteen spirit\u201d and inundated by conspiracy theories regarding Kurt\u2019s abrupt demise. Pearl Jam is easily the most accessible band of the five, seeing how most of their discography is closer to \u201cStadium Rock\u201d than the aforementioned grunge sound that Nirvana encapsulates. Your dad will probably be into it, for the love of god do not profess your adoration for Pearl Jam while surrounded by hordes of lawns and beer bellies. To appease my malicious soul, I shall summarize STP\u2019s pitiful existence with the following line: \u201cI\u2019m not like them, but I can pretend.\u201d The big five possess their strengths and weaknesses, although Stone Temple Pilots is sucky all across the fretboard. Aha, music jokes. Music isn\u2019t and should never be a contest. You\u2019re undermining the inherent beauty of it once you disregard the rest for a nonexistent objective best. ",

            "answer_text": "They\u2019re only two definitive grunge bands that I believe are the best representations and therefore the best grunge bands of the \u201890s. Those two would be Nirvana and Mudhoney. Both of them represent the quintessential sound of grunge: the punk ethos and spirit; the raw garage sound; the heaviness and slowness of the tempo, and the tuning of the guitar which gave the dirty sound. While grunge has much diversity melding heavy metal and classic rock to its mix, the punk quality of the best grunge bands really stood out. Great bands like Soundgarden, The Melvins and Alice in Chains were much more hard rock oriented and borrowed some of the late 80s thrash/doom metal sound that were more or less a staple at the time with bands like Anthrax and Metallica. Pearl Jam, Screaming Trees and Love Battery all had classic rock influences that worked well with some very melodic blend to the sound. Tad was a really interesting band that played some bombastic White Zombiesh punk that was really out there. But the question is best grunge band or bands and Mudhoney and Nirvana captured that sound so well both from a commercial aspect and a lyrical aspect which epitomized grunge. Personally, Bleach and Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge are the staples of grunge albums. Lastly, I have no idea why people keep placing Stone Temple Pilots in the grunge genre. Yes, their first album Core had some grunge ambiance. But it was so slick and cleverly produced focusing on tight playing which embodied a modern rock format that it lost any merit of grunge. Moreover, the follow-up, Purple, was nowhere remotely near grunge. How does \u201cInterstate Love Song\u201d qualify as a grunge song? ",
