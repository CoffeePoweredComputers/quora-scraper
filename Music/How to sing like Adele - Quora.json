            "answer_text": "Adele has a nice voice, but has her quirks. Yet she has sold millions of records (including to me). I think the reason is that she is willing to sing about things that are intensely personal, yet universal, with a very high degree of authenticity and vulnerability. There are no filters. She is willing to pour out her innermost thoughts with extreme passion (but appropriate passion for the song.) So how does she tap into these primal emotions? A key piece is that in most cases, she writes her own songs. By writing songs from her life experience, she can tap into a well of emotion and memory.  So for you, 1) sing in your own voice2) seek out material that allows you to be authentic and vulnerable3) if you don't find any material, write your own. ",

            "answer_text": "We cannot. We are born with our own vocal cords that we can improve with training and practice, but we can never sound like Adele just as how Ed Sheeran cannot sound like Sam Smith or how Ian Gillan cannot sound like Ronnie James Dio. The only thing that we all can learn from her is to sing to express, and not to impress. We all love Adele for her ability to express her vulnerability in her songs - even though her songs are mostly of similar themes (i.e. unrequited love and breakups), the way she immerses herself into her lyrics gives her expression a lot more depth than her pop contemporaries. Similarly, we can try to express whatever we are feeling at that moment in the songs we are singing - ultimately it will come out as authentic. ",
