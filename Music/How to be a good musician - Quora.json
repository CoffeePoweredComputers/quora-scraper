            "answer_text": "You touch upon a lot of interesting questions, so I will address them as you have laid them out. Many people tend to learn the bare minimum to accomplish a task, and music is no exception. Many musicians I would regard as being unschooled and not knowledgeable, but that has not diminished their contributions to music. There are degrees of how quickly people learn things, but of course you work with what you have got. One thing that is rare is absolute pitch - few people (or musicians for that matter) possess it. Relative pitch is an acquirable skill, and it is certainly helpful when creating music. Can you hear when two notes are octaves of each other? That is the simplest example of relative pitch. Perhaps more important is to hear how notes relate to each  other. Does a note at the end of a phrase feel resolved? Does a note feel like it is segueing towards another note?As a guitarist, I appreciate many of its conveniences, and I am also aware of its shortcomings. I studied the piano a bit, and it is MUCH harder to transpose a phrase on it vs. the guitar. As for the linear aspect, I often teach students to play a scale on just one string. It is useful to see the scale patterns that way, and in many cases it is practical as well.With many artistic creations, some artists reflect on how things magically came into place. What is often left out is the years of practice to get to that point. Also left out is how a lot of creation happens while we sleep.People start the musical process in a multitude of ways, some by some sort of inspiration or mood, and some by following known theories on composition. Often it is a combination of the two. If you are really lost, do what many composers before have done - they will use an existing piece (or pieces) as a starting point and build off of that. You can take music and make something minor into major by shifting some notes. You can add chords, or simplify a structure. When you impose different rhythms and phrasing to notes,  things will sound very different. This is a great way of learning.Of course lyrics relate to the music. If it is a direct correlation is another story. A common juxtaposition is to have the message of the lyrics clash with the tone of the music. ",

            "answer_text": "I cannot find a comment which explains this question in more detail. But apparently it exists somewhere! If someone can let me know where the original question is, I would love to know. However I have spent a life trying to be the best musician I can be, and have had some success. Trying to distill all I know about this down to a couple of sentences, the most important thing is that there is never an \u201cend\u201d to how much you can improve. Depending on the instrument, there are many things to work on at once. On a string instrument, one must make a beautiful tone 100 percent of the time, play each note perfectly in tune (as close as possible), use vibrato as appropriate, play every note at the right time and the right length, follow all phrasing directions, and follow all other directions written in the part. All that is about your own part. Then you must fit your part in perfectly with other players. These are just the basics. Then you must make MUSIC out of your playing. Playing with others who have the same goals and abilities helps. To achieve these things, the most important thing we need is feedback, which must come from an excellent teacher, starting from the very beginning. If a musician needs to be reminded to \u201clisten\u201d then that musician is not doing his or her job. If you are playing alone, you don\u2019t have the burden of staying in ensemble with others, but that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have to listen. Listen, change, improve. Repeat. Get feedback. Get a good teacher, and practice daily. A good teacher is someone who both pushes you and encourages you, and STOPS you when you need to stop and focus on something. ",

            "answer_text": "I read re-read your question several times.  Let's divide a few issues and clarify.   You're expressing frustration, which results when expectations don't match the results you're getting.  Expectations?  That's perhaps the first thing that is not completely clear as I read what you've written.   Would you say you expect to ... be a world class musician?   Do you hope to gain fame and travel the world?  Would you say you're just hopeful of sincerely expressing your feelings with music?  Depending on what you're after determines the path you should be on.  It's good to study theory and related technical issues regarding guitar, but I associate such issues with lofty goals of a performing professional musician.  Those concepts may be getting in your way at this time.  When writing music, stay close to your own personal experience, and be as honest as you can.  It's like the advice given to authors:   \"Write about what you know from personal experience.\"  ...and keep it simple (my advice.) You'll find your \"story,\" your emotions, are as legitimate and potentially as poetic as anyone else's.   The guitar is your \"co-writer\" of that story, an accompaniment.  Treat it as a good friend, not as a barrier to be overcome.  ",
