            "answer_text": "Based on your question, it sounds like you are doubting whether actors like Bradley Cooper are really capable of singing as well as they sound, or whether they are getting some help from technology. First off, please note that the songs you hear in the movies are generally recorded in a studio in advance of the filming. In most cases, the vocals in that studio recording are sung by the same actor who will then lip sync their own vocals in the scene that gets filmed. So if you are asking whether the studio recording of the song that you see in the movies contains any pitch correction, the answer is it depends on the singer. There are plenty of actors who can sing well. I seriously doubt that Idina Menzel used any pitch correction for her vocals in Frozen. Even Jack Nicholson shocked us with his voice as the doctor in Tommy. But there are some actors who I am sure rely on pitch correction. ",

            "answer_text": "The thing that casual fans seem to ignore is that auto tune is a generic tool that allows for a very broad range of correction. When Cher (in \u201cDo you believe\u2026\u201d) and a few more made auto tune popular, they used to the max on purpose,to make a normal human voice sound as robotic as possible. It was kind of a joke, or if you will, a fad. But if a singer misses a note by a small fraction, it can be corrected with auto tune and no one will notice. The only way to ensure what you\u2019re asking would be to watch the same actors singing live, in a theater without a mic, and then compare to what you hear in a movie. Unless the difference is staggering (bear in mind movies can be recorded in many takes, until you get the result you wanted), I\u2019d extend the benefit of the doubt on the actor. ",

The live action version of \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d had poor Emma Watson practically zombified, she was so autotuned. Same for Simba in the live action \u201cThe Lion King\u201d. It\u2019s like Photoshop, but for your voice. Nobody sings that straight. Happily, Luke Evans (Gaston) and Josh Gad (LeFou), being consummate professional singers, ate their songs alive. If they were autotuned, it escaped me. That\u2019s what happens when you hire a pro. ",
