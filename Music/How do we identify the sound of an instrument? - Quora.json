            "answer_text": "The way you identify any sound is by experience. Your ear/brain is picking out overtones, relative strengths of overtones, transient overtones, incidental noises, etc., as mentioned in the other answers. These differentiate sounds. When you experience the sound in context, you associate the characteristics of the sound with the instrument. Now you can identify the instrument that is making the sound. Pretty quickly you can differentiate classes of sounds. This is a string being bowed; this is a string being plucked; this is a horn. This can now start a virtuous cycle. You can now start consciously listening for things to differentiate sounds and use them to further refine your ability to identify instruments and even different techniques on an instrument. This isn\u2019t just limited to the specifics of musical instruments. We also develop associations between a sound and the kind of thing that produces them even without know the specific thing that produced the sound. For example, we can listen to a buzzing sound and know that it is caused by something vibrating and not something like water flowing in a river. We can hear a tap on something and tell whether it is solid or hollow. In fact, it\u2019s kind of amazing that guitars and violins and such don\u2019t just sound like hollow wooden boxes. Some examples. If you have a car, you know that it makes a lot of sounds, some good, some bad. You may hear some kind of squeal coming from under the hood. You can describe the sound, maybe, but that\u2019s about it. You take the car to a mechanic and he says you need a new fan belt. From experience, he can identify the source of the squeal as a worn fan belt. Karl Rainer\u2019s answer mentioned the violin family of instruments. If you\u2019ve heard bowed notes on a violin, you can pretty easily generalize it to other members of the violin family. When you hear a violin string being plucked, if you have never seen/heard it before, your first guess is not going to be violin. Once you hear the sound and make the association, however, your brain files it away for future use. Christopher Smith\u2019s answer mentions the importance of the attack of a sound as a means of identifying it. A great example of this is in this video of Jan Akkerman of Focus Focus - Hamburger Concerto (Don Kirsner's Rock Concert 1974) . Go up to the 5:50 mark and watch and listen. Pay attention to the pinky finger of his right hand. It\u2019s looped around one of the volume controls of the guitar. He plucks the string when the volume is down and then quickly pulls his pinky to bring up the volume. The actual attack of the note on the string is lost. The sound is not something that you would identify as a guitar. ",

            "answer_text": "Other answers have spoken of the harmonic content, which affects the waveform. Of course, you can\u2019t SEE the shape of a waveform when you\u2019re listening, so it really is the harmonic content that you hear. The shape of the note (often represented in electronic music as attack, decay, sustain, and release, or ADSR) is a big indicator to our ear. Guitar has a very fast attack and decays after that to the end of the note, while a flute has a much slower attack and a short decay before sustaining. You can play with the envelope (ADSR) of an instrument and make it sound quite unusual, to the point that you might have trouble recognizing it. The most important part of identifying the instrument, by far, is the attack (I include the intial decay in this). There are frequencies that ONLY show up in the first fraction of a second, and the way that they show up (how quickly they appear, how loud they get, and how quickly they disappear) is the biggest single clue to a listener as to what instrument they are hearing. Experiments were run with the attack portion of a sound being removed, so only the sustained and release portions were heard. Many instruments sounded so strange as to be complete mysteries, resembling most a curious kind of organ. You could even graft the attack of a violin onto a flute sustain, and it would sound more like a violin than a flute, even though it was only 1/20th of a second of violin and 5 seconds of flute. ",
