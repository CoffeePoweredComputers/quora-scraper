These are the highest counts on an individual version displayed on YouTube, not the total of views, but the ratios are about the same. Many R&B/Soul/Blues songs that were originally recorded by black artists have been \"covered\" by white artists and found more popularity with the 'general public' going all the way back to Elvis Presley covering Arthur Crudup's \"That's Alright, Mama.\" (Thanks for asking, Shakil.)
