            "answer_text": "It's not bad- not by any meaningful definition of the word, but it is a shame. I mean, if the only thing stopping you learning to play an instrument is your own choice not to, and not some sort of physical or mental disability that makes it impossible, or such poverty that you can't afford to, or such massive demands on your time from other important things that you can't spare the time to do it, then I think it's sad. I've been a guitarist for 20 years or more now, and it's brought me so much joy that I feel sorry for people who don't learn to make music. It's been frustrating, it's cost me more money than just about anything I've owned except my house (that's been my choice- I like toys) but it's been a constant source of happiness and relaxation and has opened doors to all manner of interesting experiences- I've played for audiences at live music venues large and small (mostly small), open mic nights, churches, in holiday caravans and at parties. I've been privileged to go in to professional studios to record music that I've had a hand in making. I've been even more privileged to play music with some wonderful, talented musicians (and a few dickheads), some of whom (but not the dickheads) I still count as good friends. Out of the necessities of being an electric guitarist I've found practical applications for high school physics that I never thought I'd use. I've learned to solder. I've been blown away by talented bands I'd never have heard if my band hadn't been on the same bill (and seen some absolute toss too). I've even earned a little bit of money along the way. All while holding down a job, getting married and having children like a normal person. Even if I'd never performed, or played with other musicians (although quite frankly, why would I do that? Music is meant to be shared), I'd still have given myself the most wonderful gift by learning to make music. Nothing picks me up when I'm down like picking up my guitar. Nothing gives me more enjoyment (alright, nothing  I can keep my clothes on for...), gives me more peace of mind, or has proven to be so infinitely interesting as making music. You needn't spend every hour of every day working on your craft to get reasonably good at your instrument of choice. You don't have to set out to be a bazillionaire rock star for it to be worth learning to play at all. You don't have to be very good to be able to perform some types of music (and still perform them well). You don't have to be very good to be able to play in a band. You don't have to be very good to enjoy playing. You don't necessarily have to spend a lot of money. You don't always have to take formal lessons.  Having had the life experiences I've had as a musician, I'd want to hear a damn good excuse why someone couldn't learn to play an instrument and open up all the same wonderful opportunities to themselves. Like I said, it's not bad not to play an instrument, it's just a waste, and a damn shame. ",

            "answer_text": "Not bad at all, it depends what kind of person you are and what you find interesting.  For me music is my passion, it's the one thing in this world that makes perfect sense to me, but for other people that subject will be completely different.What made you ask this question?  If it's something that you thought of and not an influence from someone else's opinion then I think you should have a go at playing, there's nothing to lose!  Pick up a recorder, a guitar, have a go on a piano, the drums, try everything, it's the only way for you to find out how you feel about the subject.If you do have a go don't let frustration get you down, don't expect to be the next Hendrix after a week, just do it for the fun of it, as a stress relief, as a comfort, as a new experience and see where it takes you.  If you feel a connection carry on, if you don't, don't feel bad, either be persistent and push through the hard times, or find another subject that suits you better.I don't know if this has answered the question you asked, but I hope it helped in some way.Just have a go, run with it and have fun!  That's what life's about, and for me, music helps me to stay strong and be positive! ",
