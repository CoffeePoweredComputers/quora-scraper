It is also applicable to each EU countries thanks to General Data Protection Regulation - Wikipedia (even if for most, like fr, it was already true before). Still, in practice, I contacted Spotify in order to have it, which they declined. They told me that I could get an extract of last 90 days. I\u2019m pretty sure that they keep a way longer history since they present yearly statistics in December. I find it really disappointing. I really love Spotify, and since I spent hours daily listening music I would really like to explore those data. Do not hesitate to keep me up to date if you find a way. ",
