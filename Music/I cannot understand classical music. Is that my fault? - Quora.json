            "answer_text": "Yes! It means you are an uncultured philistine. No, I'm totally kidding. It doesn't mean that at all. If it's anyone's fault it's our education systems for not teaching us to listen to classical music. I didn't begin to be able to understand it till I was 20, and 25 years later there sre still many pieces of music and in fact entire composers who do nothing for me. I would say that, to understand classical music, you have to be able to hear the structure in a long piece of instrumental music, without lyrics or a lot of obvious repetition to guide you. You need to be able to recognise a theme when it's being developed, and to anticipate what's going to happen and when (not what exactly is going to happen but what kind of thing is likely to happen.) You have to be used to the sound of the instruments and not bored or deterred by them. You meed to be familiar enough with the conventions (e.g. Mozart\u2019s habitual use of certain phrases to show when one bit is ending or transitioning) that they serve their purpose of keeping you oriented within the piece. And of course, you don't have to like classical music. No one does. Anymore than people have to like any music at all. ",

            "answer_text": "It largely comes down to what music you are accustomed to listening. When I was a child, I was brought up in an exclusively classical music environment. To me, Pop musicians were a lesser species to be held in contempt. However, nearly six years ago I started to play in Residential homes - not just the elderly (who might prefer music I quite liked anyway from the Shows etc.), but the young, who had conditions such as cerebral palsy and Downs Syndrome. They didn\u2019t want my classical music or shows, but Adele. I came to realise that while there IS a lot of dross in Pop (but there is crap classical music too!), there are genuinely talented artists as well. What I am saying is this: I found a way \u201cin\u201d to appreciating at least some elements of popular culture. One way \u201cin\u201d for you might be to have a listen to how certain pop pieces have been given a \u201cclassical\u201d treatment\u2026in a way it reveals that there is not an unbridgeable gulf between the genres (and indeed, a genre has developed known as \u201ccrossover\u201d music is proof). See what you think of what is known as \u201cThe Queen Symphony\u201d = popular numbers from Queen given a classical treatment:TOLGA KASHIF - The QUEEN Symphony - An Anthology of the Works of Freddie Mercury and Queen.
