            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a foolproof formula for this, but I can suggest some simple steps that work in most cases. I assume you\u2019re mixing a song that\u2019s more or less pop format, i.e., drums and some kind of instruments, and either vocals or an instrument as the lead. Start with drums and whatever the lead instrument or voice is going to be, with everything else turned off. Mono is fine, at least at first. Get your levels set nicely, so the master bus levels are moderate and fairly balanced. Gradually bring in the accompanying tracks, one at a time (or in groups, if appropriate, like chorus vocals), watching to see that the master levels (which will go up) stay in a reasonable range. You may have to make slight adjustments as you go, and you should, because your first guess as to the right level for each track may change as you bring more of them up. When you have a decent rough mix, you can start trying some stereo panning, to give your sound some separation and width. If that seems to be working well, you could choose to do a little EQ (equalization). Cutting frequencies that you don\u2019t want is usually preferable to boosting anything, as cutting doesn\u2019t cause phase problems later, but boosting can. Also, cutting will tend to reduce the level of the track, where boosting will raise the level and might cause distortion where you don\u2019t want it. A little EQ is enough if your tracks are well recorded. If they\u2019re not, re-record rather than trying to perfect something already flawed. Finally, you might add the effects of your choice. Be selective. Too much or too many effects can really turn a mix into a muddy blur. Remember that if you put effects on everything, none of them will stand out much. Put a few where you really want them to shine, and then stop. If you keep adding more, you\u2019ll be more likely to make everything less distinct and clear, and lose the benefit of any of the good ones you added first. ",

            "answer_text": "Mixing is subjective but this always works for me: **all of this can be achieved in the box using what came with your DAW of choice** LISTEN. Most times the mixing process is a lot easier than we make it. Your task and goal here is to find a listening volume where you can have a conversation and not yell to be heard. At lower volumes your tracks will reveal what\u2019s too bright and what\u2019s not cutting through the mix. Its tempting to boost frequencies but concentrating on the frequencies that each instrument uses and \u2018cutting\u2019 back where it\u2019s not needed gives greater results. Your high hats can survive cutting everything below 300hz. Your kick can make it with a cut above 5000khz. Anything not producing sound in the range required for that instrument is WASTED ENERGY THAT WILL BUILD UP from track to track. Following this strategy you will bypass the need to find the hiss being heard. PLACEMENT. Some instruments are centered but others need a little panning to open up the soundstage. The goal when mixing is for everything to be heard equally at low volume and to sound equally as pleasing when your master fader is pushed higher. If when you raise the volume and your brain tells you to dial it back chances are there\u2019s something in the mix that\u2019s not sitting in its ideal location. Loudness adds excitement but it also reveals harsh areas that your ears just can\u2019t handle for long. MIX IN MONO. If it separates and stands well in mono your stereo mix will be greater. Mono mixing helps you understand how your mix might sound on a TV or device lacking stereo setup. If mixing should be at lower volumes mostly, just as well most of your mixing should be done in mono to save time. AUTOMATION. Something that honestly can\u2019t be avoided with most modern mixes. You have to give instruments their right time to shine. The same level keys might not be as effective on the hook where the snare and kick get louder. To handle this write in automation (ride the fader) to set levels throughout the song from start to finish. This will make the song \u2018move\u2019 and keep things interesting. FADES. Fade in and fade out of track regions (recorded parts) to avoid pops and clicks. ZOOM IN to get it right. Detailed work requires more detailed listening BELIVE your eyes but TRUST YOUR EARS. If it sounds too loud it is. If it sounds flat, it is. Reference tracks can guide you where ur going. Without it ur just driving in the desert hoping you in Vegas. Compare your mix to a song in the same genre as the one you\u2019re working on. ***Fun fact*** Poker Face by Gaga was recorded and mixed using nothing but Logic Pros stock sounds and plugins. You don\u2019t need add-ons to make a hit record. ",
