            "answer_text": "I was originally planning to make a video about this, but there are small things that everyone should know when it comes to KPop dances. First, just learn the damn thing. Choose the types of songs you want to dance. Break it into sections, and if possible learn songs that have repeating chorus dances instead of different dances for every verse and chorus. After you've gotten the gist of it down, repeat and repeat and repeat. Build the dance up from a slower pace to the original pace and make sure your timing is right. A lot of the time, even if your movements are choppy, the dance will look less messy if you have the timing down. At one point, the dance moves will become ingrained into your body. At that stage you will be able to add in small details that you might have missed when you first learned this or add your own twist to the dance and make it look personalized. Always go back to the original dance practices. If they're not available, go to a mirrored fancam of a live performance. I am of the belief that the original is always the best, so I hardly ever look at dance covers because none of them are as good as the idols. Stand in front of a mirror to see how you're moving. Remember to change the mood depending on the song. Powerful moves don't suit every song, fluidity doesn't suit every song either. The best dancers always create a special mood around a piece and make it work. Build your flexibility and your strength. Believe me, there are a lot dances that require either, or even both. Review the originals. There will always be parts that you might have missed, parts that you can do better. Make sure to make the dance your own. You will never be able to recreate the original perfectly because you are different. So just add your own feel to the dance. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi! I\u2019m not a professional at dancing but I\u2019ll give some advice that I think you could work on. The first thing I noticed was your facial expressions. I didn\u2019t see much and you had the same facial expression which kind of made the video boring. If you have a mirror (it doesn\u2019t have to be a big mirror like maybe your bathroom mirror or something should work), practice on your facial expressions and how you can express the song\u2019s emotion.You can watch solo fancams. If you\u2019re following a certain member\u2019s part, look at their fancams and see their facial expressions or how they dance.Second, you kind of looked awkward (I really liked the part at 0:15 when you transitioned from a powerful move to a kind of slow, steady movement. Honestly, I don\u2019t know how to explain it well LOL). Practice the dance many times to be able to get the feel of it and be comfortable with the moves. The more you practice, the better the results are. Your first try or take isn\u2019t always going to be the best. That\u2019s why they say practice makes perfect.Not only does practice makes perfect but it will also build up your confidence. This can help with your awkwardness and your moves will be much bolder/powerful. I know you can do so much better than this! I believe in you.I recommend to not do main stream songs because many people will use the same songs as well and it can get boring for the judges. But it\u2019s not my audition and I\u2019m not a judge so you can dance to whatever you\u2019re confident in. Again, I am not a professional dancer or anything so what I say/mentioned is my opinion on what I watched. I\u2019m just a casual person who enjoys doing kpop dance covers. You got this and I hope you do well on your future auditions! Good luck! ~ k ",
