            "answer_text": "I see three very good answers already. There is nothing I disagree with in any of them and I up-voted them accordingly. Read them before reading mine because you may get everything you need. If you do want more, let me summarize what is in each of the other answers so far. The longest one, by David I. Bell, outlines several strategies that work well for those who have a fair amount of music theory under their belt. If you know about standard popular music forms and how they are constructed, figuring out what chords to play, and predicting what to play next, reduces to aural pattern recognition. As soon as you recognize something you know about, you test that theory by playing what you think should come next, then assessing that theory by seeing if your best guess sounds right. This works great if you know what you are doing and can instantly play along with, say, blues or a \u201cdoo-wop\u201d song as soon as you identify the tonic. The more of these patterns you know, the quicker you will be a \u201csitting in\u201d on a piece that you do not know. The more you practice doing this, either playing along with recordings or with other musicians in live sessions, the more patterns you will recognize.Next, Stan Rosenson gives a medium-sized answer which amounted to roughly the same thing with less detail, but he emphasized the importance of relative pitch. Bell seems to assume that you can hear different harmonic intervals and name them, which Rosenson recognizes not everyone can do. If you\u2019re not very good with that sort of thing, it will be as difficult to figure songs out using Stan\u2019s approach as it will using David\u2019s.The shortest answer, the one by Jon Claflin, is the one I recommend to anyone who doesn\u2019t know much music theory or hasn\u2019t been a musician for very long. All he does is give you the bare essentials to get started doing this sort of inquiry. He barely mentions the idea of stock chord progressions, but does imply that there are not very many of them, and, if you learn what they are, you will be able to fit the song you are analyzing into one of them. I really like that part about ignoring everything but the bass line. Cool. That trick alone will divulge the tonic most of the time, which is half the battle.What these three approaches to the problem have in common is that they tell you to listen for patterns. This is only meaningful if you know what the pattern is and can match it by ear. In other words, to figure out the chord progression is to a song you don\u2019t know the chord progression for, you have to know what the chord progression is that you\u2019re looking for and test it to hear if it fits with what you\u2019re hearing. If you don\u2019t know how to do any of this, and you don\u2019t much music theory, and you\u2019re so mystified about how to do this that you ask a na\u00efve question in a forum like this, then how are you ever going to learn how to do it? Yikes. This is the old musicological fast shuffle. You have to spend years studying all this stuff to do a simple thing like figuring out what chords to play in some mindless ditty written by someone who doesn\u2019t know any more about music than you do. No. Let me assure you that learning to \u201csuss out\u201d chord progressions can be done be by anyone willing to put in the time and effort to learn the things the explained in the other answers. They did. I did. It took me far too long to acquire that skill, but I can do it to some extent. We learned it the hard way, working through all the ear recognition stuff to eventually be able to hear chords in our minds, recognize standard chord progressions and play along. But, there are now several new tricks you can use to figure out chord progressions faster that don\u2019t require as much musical training. The important thing to remember is to be goal-oriented. It\u2019s commendable to learn all the theory and become highly skilled at hearing subtleties in complex music, but if you goal is to just play the right chords in the right place, then what does it matter how you get there? So, what I\u2019m suggesting is that where your level of musical training and the acuity of your aural perception fall short, don\u2019t retire to you ivory tower and pore over books! CHEAT! Yeah. That\u2019s right. I said it. Figure out what the chords are using the fastest, cheapest, easiest way you can find. There are lots of sleazy gags that have come into common use since the advent of the internet. Here are some of my favorites, in no particular order. Buy commercial sheet music or guitar tablature. This is my least favorite method because I\u2019m cheap as hell and don\u2019t like paying money for anything. However, if you\u2019re pressed for time and killing several hours to nail a song by ear alone is not an economic decision for you and you would rather spend a few bucks and be done with it, then go for it.Find amateur chord-and-lyric song sheets for free that were contributed by other people trying to do the same sort of thing. This is the \u201cbig data\u201d approach to learning chord progressions. If you look at several versions, and they all use the same chord progression, then that\u2019s probably right, or close enough to it. (\u201cClose\u201d means that if you play the song that way for someone else, they recognize it.) If versions don\u2019t agree, then none of them may be correct. Starting with no more than three versions that sound \u201cpretty good\u201d to you, use them, one at a time, to play along with a recording. You may find, as I have on numerous occasions, that parts of all of them are right, but each has something wrong. Build your own version if you have to by cobbling together the parts of any version that sound exactly right to you. You may end up figuring out what to play in some spots all on your own, that is, deducing the chords using the techniques described in the other answers. That\u2019s great if you can do it. If you start with someone else\u2019s work, though, and only have to figure out a little bit here and there by yourself, you will achieve the final result much faster.Watch videos of live concert performances. This is mostly for guitar players. If you watch a guitar player\u2019s hands, you can often spot quicker, easier ways to play the chords you need. Do they use a capo? Can you tell if they are using a standard tuning or something else? Are they using barr\u00e9 for that chord or hand shapes with open strings? You can avoid a lot of wasted time and needless agony over that country song in B\u266d when you see that all the guitars have a capo on the third fret and they are just playing standard chords and licks for the key of G. That\u2019s a trivial example, but it proves that seeing someone play it is more helpful than just hearing it.Watch videos where someone teaches you how to play the piece on your instrument, usually piano or guitar. This can be incredibly efficient. More of these videos appear all the time, put out by would-be instructors trying to attract paying students. You don\u2019t have to pay anything to learn that one song from them, and there are literally thousands of musicians trying to make money this way, so there are lots of different songs available. You can even find famous artists showing you how to play their songs. I\u2019ve learned songs by watching YouTube videos by Nancy Wilson of Heart, John Sebastian, Neil Young and James Taylor. They will tell you the right chords to play, for sure.Use a web app that will attempt to derive a chord progression from the recording itself. I\u2019ve tried this one a few times: Instant chords for any song - Chordify I wasn\u2019t totally pleased by this app when I\u2019ve used it, but it does a reasonable job of giving you something to start with so you don\u2019t have to do the donkey work of figuring out the tonic and what key it\u2019s in and what the basic chords used in the song are. Sometimes, what they get is totally wrong, but you will hear that yourself when you try to play the song that way. I\u2019ve only resorted to doing this when I couldn\u2019t find anything else. It was better than nothing, though, and still much faster than doing it all by ear.Use the pentatonic minor box trick. This is another guitar-only gag. Anyone who attempts to play blues or do solo playing in any other type of folk or pop music will have learned how to run a pentatonic minor scale using a four-fret \u201cwindow\u201d on the neck of the guitar, or to use the more common term, \u201cbox\u201d.Find the tonic on the first string, matching tones by ear.The tonic you have found will be the fret position of the lower boundary of the four-fret box if the mode of the piece is blues, natural minor (Aeolian) or Dorian. You will have to be able to tell if it\u2019s one of those \u201cnon-major\u201d modes, but not necessarily which one, at least for the moment. All you have to be sure of is that it\u2019s not the standard, three-chord, \u201cfart in a barrel\u201d major.If the song does sound like major (Ionian) mode, or Mixolydian mode (almost the same \u2014 don\u2019t worry about it yet), then the tonic is positioned as the upper boundary of the box. That is, the tonic is at the high end of the box and the box extends three frets below that fret position. What you will be playing is tones in the minor key that is the relative minor of the major key for which you have located the tonic. It sounds strange, but it works.Play notes in the box pattern and assess whether or not these tones coincide with the melody you hear in the song. If it sounds good and there are no \u201cclinkers\u201d, you may have completed your search for the key signature, which will lead you directly to the set of basic triads (simple chords) you can play with that song.Surprisingly, playing along by ear using the right pentatonic scale will often match the melody better than playing all seven tones of the diatonic scale in which the piece is actually set. Most modern popular music is written that way. This is why the \u201cbox trick\u201d is a handy method to quickly determine what key a song is in. You will be able to \u201cpick up on\u201d a single-note melody line faster than deciding whether chords that \u201cshould fit\u201d because of the supposed tonic and mode actually do fit.If your first guess about where the tonic is doesn\u2019t work out, that is, the pentatonic notes you play sound \u201cfunny\u201d, then try something else. This is a good time to listen to the bass line to match the tonic, but use the sixth string, the other E string, because its tone is closer to that of the bass itself.Once you have the right tonic and are satisfied that the pentatonic box pattern has enough of the right notes in the melody to sound like a rudimentary lead riff, you are ready to use the tonic to determine the key signature and the chords that go with it. The rules are different for different modes. The procedure is fairly simple, but takes some explaining.You have to know your circle of fifths and fourths to do this. If you don\u2019t know what that is or you haven\u2019t memorized it yet, stop reading now. Go here, Circle of fifths - Wikipedia, memorize the sequence, and then come back here to finish reading.For Ionian mode (major), the three major chords used will be (I, \u201ceye\u201d) the one whose root tone is the tonic you have determined, (IV) the one whose root tone is to the left in the circle, meaning that it is the subdominant of the tonic and (V) the one whose root tone is to the right in the circle, meaning that it is the dominant of the tonic. The other four tones in the scale are the root tones of three minor triads (ii, iii and vi) and one diminished (vii\u00b0) triad. If you want to try to use up to seven basic triad chords in a song, you can, but most songs only use three or four different triads composed entirely of scale degree tones. This fact is the basis of the term \u201cthree-chord special\u201d and the aphorism \u201cthree chords and the truth.\u201d It\u2019s how people write songs for the most part.For Aeolian mode (natural minor), figure out what chords to play based on the relative major scale of the minor scale you are using, which has the same tones and key signature as the Aeolian scale. That is, use the upper boundary of your pentatonic minor box to locate this relative major\u2019s tonic. Proceed as with Ionian mode, but the three principal chords to use are minor triads rather than major triads. The convention is to retain the Roman numeral sequence of the key signature Ionian mode scale. That is, even though the tonic is \u201ctone 1\u201d of the scale, the triad with the tonic as its root tone is still referred to with the numeral vi, rather than i. Retaining this nomenclature makes it easier to remember which triads are major and which are minor because most people only memorize this Roman numeral sequence for Ionian mode (I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, vii\u00b0). If we were to reorder it for Aeolian, it would be i, ii\u00b0, III, iv, v, VI, VII, which would confuse just about everyone, so we don\u2019t do that. In addition to that, the triad based on the dominant (iii in Ionian, v in Aeolian) is usually played as a major triad (III in Ionian or V in Aeolian) instead of a minor triad. As in all modes, the most frequently used triad in a song is the one whose root tone is the tonic. For example, the most common triad in a piece set in the key of A minor is Am, even though the chord\u2019s Roman numeral designation is vi. An interesting fact is that the minor \u201cwalk-down\u201d sequence (vi\u2192V\u2192IV\u2192III) using the chords Am\u2192G\u2192F\u2192E (rather than Em) is so common in guitar songs that most guitar players will spot it immediately and begin playing along without going through all the usual tonic locating and chord testing rigamarole. Oddly, significantly fewer guitar players will spot Dm\u2192C\u2192B\u266d\u2192A as the same thing transposed to the subdominant because it\u2019s less commonly used. Knowing this, and the circle of fifths, though, makes songs like Sultans of Swing much easier to pick up on by ear.The procedure for Dorian mode is similar for that of natural minor, but the corresponding Ionian mode tonic for the key signature and set of chords to be used is found by descending two frets from the Dorian tonic at the lower boundary of the pentatonic box. The most common use of Dorian mode in the Western Hemisphere is salsa and related Latin-American music forms. You can usually spot this because of the recognizable \u201ctwo-five\u201d Latin montuno form, which is a two-chord sequence of a minor triad whose root tone is the Dorian tonic, followed by a major triad whose root tone is the fourth scale degree of the Dorian scale. One might think that this figure would be called a \u201cone-four\u201d chord progression because the chords are based on the \u201cone note\u201d and the \u201cfour note\u201d. It is called \u201ctwo-five\u201d because it stands for the Roman numeral designation for the triads (ii-V) retained from the key signature\u2019s Ionian mode numbering for triads. The term \u201ctwo-five\u201d, transmitted orally, is universally understood. If you were to refer to it as \u201cone-four Dorian\u201d, many musicians would not know what you meant. They would at least have to think about it for a bit because no one calls it that. Musicologists have criticized me for saying that this is the case and that \u201cone-four Dorian\u201d is perfectly acceptable nomenclature. It is for them, but any salsero would think it odd for you to say that because, \u201cEverybody knows that form is called a \u2018two-five\u2019.\u201d Don\u2019t fight it.For blues, it gets cute. You have designated the \u201cnon-major\u201d tonic as the fret position of the lower boundary of the pentatonic box where playing the notes in that pattern is consistent with the melody line of the song. You need to select three major triads (I, IV and V) as the principal chords for the song using as their root tones three adjacent tones from the circle of fifths. However, do not ascend three frets for the relative major to locate the root tone of the I triad. Instead, use the \u201cminor\u201d tonic as the root tone for the I triad, the tone to its left for the IV triad and the tone to its right as the root tone of the V triad. You will find that this works out perfectly, that is, playing a minor pentatonic scale that overlays the parallel major scale with the same tonic sounds like blues. Doing something else usually does not. Blues is usually defined as a twelve-bar progression using three major triads with a subdominant-tonic-dominant relationship. The basic melodic structure is characterized as an alteration to Ionian mode by adding extra tones, the \u201cblue notes\u201d, the flatted third and seventh scale degrees. The method shown here for determining which chords to play reverses the procedure by identifying the melodic scale first, then deriving the chords to use as accompaniment to that melody from the tonic determined. A further note about blues chords is that that there is heavy use of dominant seventh tetrads with the same root tones as the three basic major triads. For example, blues with a tonic of A uses the major triads A, D and E, but the tetrads A7, D7 and E7 are just as common. That set of six chords is usually fully adequate for any blues song. Note that the 7th intervals in the I7 and IV7 tetrads are not scale degrees in the nominal major scale of the key signature. This is because they are the blue notes. The timing of which chords to play when in the twelve-bar cycle can vary, but is usually fixed within any one song. Triads using scale degrees other than 1, 4, and 5 as the root tone are rarely used except in jazz or be-bop, where all sorts of different chords are used. If you\u2019re trying to suss out chord progressions from jazz or non-standard blues using stock chord progressions, it may be difficult if not impossible. In such cases, it will probably be more efficient to just use what someone else has already figured out. For example, learning Stormy Monday by ear alone might take you a while, but seeing it written out, even with just chord names over the lyrics, can make it almost trivial. You won\u2019t sound like T-Bone Walker or Duane Allman, but you could play along with them and not step on their solos as long as you used the right chords.Mixolydian mode is kind of sneaky. Many people conflate it with \u201cmajor\u201d (Ionian mode), but the three basic major chords used in accompaniment are not the same, just two of them. The Mixolydian tonic is the fifth scale degree (the \u201cfive note\u201d) of the Ionian mode scale with the same key signature. You don\u2019t need to concern yourself with such arithmetic, though. If all you want to do is figure out which chords to play, think about the groupings of three chords listed sequentially in the circle of fifths. The three you use are in the order \u201cIV-I-V\u201d. The procedure for Ionian mode is to locate the I chord tonic and use the tones to the left and right of it in the circle, respectively, as the IV and V root tones. Since the Mixolydian tonic is the \u201cV\u201d tone (fifth scale degree) of Ionian mode, the two other root tones are the one to its left, and the next tone to the left of that. It\u2019s still \u201cIV-I-V\u201d because we retain the Ionian mode Roman numeral numbering, but the tonic of the scale, the root tone of the \u201cmain chord\u201d for the song, is the right-most of the three tones in the set of three tones in the circle of fifths. When you use this pentatonic box method to find the tonic, you will most likely conflate Mixolydian mode with Ionian mode. You will discover your error when you try out your Ionian V triad and notice that it doesn\u2019t sound right in the song. The fix is to discard that triad and recast your deduced tonic as the right-most of three adjacent tones in the circle of fifths. The easiest way to think of this is to start with the same tonic, but use the next two tones to the left in the circle. If you play guitar, don\u2019t listen to piano players talking about flatting this and sharping that or gobbledygook about black and white keys. None of that will help you figure this stuff out quickly on a guitar. Only grouping adjacent tones in the circle of fifths will give you the answer you need directly. If you don\u2019t know your scale intervals and don\u2019t understand sharps and flats, but you know your circle of fifths, you can get by with that knowledge and a good chord chart or chord-finder app. Keyboard players have to learn all that, though, because that\u2019s how they figure out which keys to strike. It\u2019s great for a guitar player to know that sort of thing, but it\u2019s not a showstopper if you don\u2019t, just an impediment.Lydian mode doesn\u2019t come up often, but when it does, it tends to be conflated with Ionian mode because the Lydian mode tonic works in the pentatonic box just like the Ionian and Mixolydian tonics. When you get this wrong, the chord that doesn\u2019t work is the one on the other side of the three-tone sequence. The major chord with the left-most tone in the set of three doesn\u2019t fit. Your Lydian mode tonic is your IV tone, so the correct IV-I-V sequence to use is the deduced \u201cmajor\u201d tonic and the two tones to its right in the circle of fifths.So, now you have a basket of basic triads to play as accompaniment to a song. You know that they are the right chords because the tones are consistent with the melody. When you play these chords, you are using a much smaller set of chords than you would have if you were to just play major and minor chords with randomly selected root tones to guess at chord progressions. Narrowing the field increases the probability at any juncture that you will be playing the right chord, the one that fits in the song at that point. With the smaller basket of possibilities, it becomes much easier to home in on the right chord progression.Learn standard chord progression patterns used by countless popular songs in terms of Roman numeral scale degrees. It makes figuring out what chords to play much easier. Many novices make the mistake of trying to memorize sets of chords to play in different keys by rote and are oblivious to Roman numeral nomenclature. For example, they learn that \u201cin G\u201d means to play G, C and D. (The will often refer to key signatures as \u201cGCD\u201d, \u201cCFG\u201d and such.) When they are taught a song \u201cin G\u201d which also includes other chords like Am7, Em and Bm, they have no idea where those come from and why they are used. Each song\u2019s chord progression is a unique entity, different from other songs that use chords with different names. Once you learn your circle of fifths by rote, and how that sequence relates to the I, IV and V scale degrees and triads with their accompanying key signatures, you no longer have to memorize sets of alphabetic letter names because you can quickly extract the same information from the circle of fifths. It\u2019s great if you have memorized the three-chord sets of letter names, but it\u2019s no longer absolutely necessary if you know the circle of fifths.There are seven triads constructed by \u201cstacking thirds\u201d, an arcane term that just means taking every other tone in a diatonic scale until you have three tones. There are three major triads, three minor triads and one diminished triad in every scale. The methods described above tell you how to deduce triads\u2019 root tone letter names by extracting them from the circle of fifths, three at a time. For Ionian, Mixolydian and Lydian mode, you get three major triads. For Aeolian mode, you get three minor triads the same way as you get three major triads for Ionian mode, taking the letter name for the tonic and the tone to the left and right of it in the circle of fifths. Elsewhere I mentioned that you can use up to seven triads composed wholly of scale degrees. What are the other four triads in any mode? You will be happy to know that you can deduce this information from the circle of fifths as well. The trick is that the rules are slightly different for each mode. The good news is that the seven root tones you can use are all bunched together in the circle of fifths sequence with no gaps. (Any seven consecutive tones from A\u266d-E\u266d-B\u266d-F-C-G-D-A-E-B-F\u266f-C\u266f, wrapping around at the ends.) That is, the seven that you use are adjacent. Thus, the five tones you don\u2019t use are adjacent as well.Major/minor/diminished order: M\u2013M\u2013M\u2013m\u2013m\u2013m\u2013\u00b0 (Scale degree triads are shown in circle of fifths order, with M designating a major triad and m a minor triad. The \u00b0 denotes \u201cdiminished\u201d. The order of three major, three minor and a diminished chord is always the same with the bunch of seven tones.)Modes: Lydian Ionian Mixolydian Dorian Aeolian Phrygian Locrian (The classical mode names, the \u201cwhite key scales\u201d, are shown in the order where the mode\u2019s tonic appears in the bunch. This is circle of fifths order, not the Ionian scale degree order generally shown.)Example: What triads can be made with a tonic of D in Phrygian mode?Algorithm: Extract a seven-tone chunk from the circle of fifths with D as the next to last tone.Answer: E\u266d-B\u266d-F-Cm-Gm-Dm-A\u00b0Example: What triads can be made with a tonic of A\u266d in Dorian mode?Algorithm: Extract a seven-tone chunk from the circle of fifths with A\u266d as the fourth tone.Answer: B-F\u266f-D\u266d-A\u266dm-E\u266dm-B\u266dm-F\u00b0When the extracted chunk runs off either end, be sure to only count C\u266f/D\u266d only once because they both represent the same tone. I could have referred to B as C\u266d and F\u266f as G\u266d, as is the standard convention, but it\u2019s not necessary to do that to play the right tones on any instrument. I prefer to memorize one sequence of tone names rather than juggling flats and sharps.Before online apps existed, I would have been tempted to make a little slide rule to display which chords I could construct using scale degrees in different modes with different tonics. However, when I sit around trying to figure out this kind of thing, it\u2019s much easier to look at an app like this: Guitar Scales - Chord.Rocks There are a lot more scales than the seven classical modes, as well as every chord type you could possible want. When I sit around trying to come up with weird chords that fit into whatever scale I\u2019m using, this app really speeds things up.The seven basic triad in any of the classical modes are a good toolkit to start with in matching a set of chords to a melody. However, they are by no means a complete set of possible, or even likely, chords. Popular songs routinely use other chord types, such as dominant sevenths, minor sevenths, major sevenths, ninths, minor ninths, major ninths, sixths, minor sixths, diminished sevenths, half-diminished sevenths, augmented fifth, dominant sevenths with an augmented fifth, suspended seconds, suspended fourths, dominant sevenths with a suspended fourth, and more. (If I\u2019ve used others I can\u2019t think of them at the moment.) The point is, all these chord types have a particular sound and have their uses. With practice, one can learn to discern different more complex chord types by ear. I\u2019m better at this than some, but I still can\u2019t reliably identify any chord by ear with more than four tones. When there are more than four, it all tends to run together in my brain and sound \u201cmuddy\u201d. This doesn\u2019t mean that I won\u2019t like the way it sounds or won\u2019t appreciate it or won\u2019t want to use it in playing the piece. The problem is that if a chord is complex, or contains tones that are not scale degrees it can be extremely hard for anyone to identify it by ear.When chord progressions are so unique that they seem to wander all over and be constantly modulating to different keys, I give up trying to figure out the chords by ear and I search on the internet for a written document of some kind that will just lay it all out for me. As an illustration of how one can cope with frustration of this sort, I have the story of how I nailed down Girl From Ipanema. I had always liked the song, but never had a clue about how to play it. I always got lost somewhere trying to play along with it on the radio. (This started back in the late 1960\u2019s, before people owned computers and starving college students did not have stereo systems or even televisions.) It was just too damned hard. Twelve years ago, a guy in my guitar group was noodling after the weekly session, trying to play it. He had the verse down pretty close, but the bridge had him stumped. I played what he had figured out but couldn\u2019t add anything. I went home and started scouring the internet for the chord progression. I found lots of version, but most of them were terrible and sounded nothing like Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim. The fact that different chord progressions, when transposed to the same key, were wildly different and sounded like different songs. This convinced me that none of these seat-of-the-pants, play-it-by-ear guys had a clue about how to really play the song. I kept looking and eventually stumbled onto a musicology essay using the chord progression of the song to illustrate some kind of obscure harmony concept that I still don\u2019t understand. While the discussion made my eyes water and resisted any attempt on my part to understand it, the essay did explicitly rattle off the names of actual chords I could figure out how to play. And, it was in the right key, F, which I was readily able to verify by playing several versions of the song via YouTube videos. (The guitar group guy had been trying to do it in G.) I worked up my own version based on the professor\u2019s essay. It was almost the same, but a couple of weird chords that I had trouble playing were simplified. It sounded great to me and impressed my colleague. (Damn! You actually figured how to do the bridge!) What was surprising was how simple the chord progression actually was once it was there in front of me. If I hadn\u2019t found that essay, though, I probably wouldn\u2019t be able to play the song correctly even now.",

            "answer_text": "Here are a few things that helped me\u2026 your mileage may vary. I first listen to the basic bass track or piano bass line (left hand) and mentally strip away any fancy stuff. That gets me to the bones of the song.I then listen to the \u201cbones\u201d for one of the three basic forms:Is it a 12 bar blues or one of the variations of that form involving the I, IV, and V chords?Is it some kind of walk-down (listen to the classic song \u201cRunaway\u201d from 1961 and widely covered by various artists)? For example, \u201cHappy Together\u201d (The Turtles), \u201cSummer In The City\u201d (Lovin\u2019 Spoonful), \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Leave You Babe\u201d (Led Zep), \u201cWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps\u201d (George Harrison), \u201cAll Along the Watchtower\u201d (Dylan -> Hendrix) and so many other songs.Is it some kind of variation of \u201cHeart and Soul\u201d - a classic four chord progression used in almost every doo-wop song from the 50\u2019s tons of songs right on through to today.Then it\u2019s a matter of finding the right key and figuring out the variations on the basic form if there are any. Many songs are straight-up versions of the one of the three forms. Many other songs have a little variation to introduce some novelty and interest. Listen to the song carefully for major chords, minor chords, minor 7ths, major 7ths and a few other chords. Consult the web to help you get the subtleties right. Your ear will improve with time - allow yourself to \u201ccheat\u201d at first by consulting the web. The patterns will begin to emerge. A good trick is to listen to the bass and just try to find the single note that is tonal center of each chord. Then experiment with building a chord around that tonal center. Finally, there is the matter of figuring out the bridge if the song it has one. In many cases, you can get there with a little music theory since the bridge is often in a related key. Again, allow yourself to cheat by looking it up if you are having trouble figuring it out on our own. Again listen to the bass and find the tonal center of each chord in the bridge. Build from there. To practice, find an oldies radio station (or streaming channel). The oldies are often simpler. Play along with each song and get as far as you can\u2026 then move along and try to figure the next song, and the next, and the next. Jot down any songs you feel like you\u2019d to get back to. Or, turn off the radio and focus on a single tune that catches your interest. Turn on the radio again\u2026 lather, rinse, repeat. ",
