            "answer_text": "I usually listen to music before I take naps (during the day) and it\u2019s usually this: Ocean Camp by Adam Young.  In fact, I\u2019ve done it so much, I\u2019ve conditioned myself that every time I hear it when I\u2019m NOT about to take a nap, I start to feel sleepy haha Earlier this year in January, I caught my first real case of the flu. I was in a pretty bad way and I couldn\u2019t really sleep much...and when I did, I would wake up with fever sweats and chills, even though I was exhausted. Adam Young released this album and this song was literally the only thing that really got me to fall asleep and stay asleep. I\u2019d just put my headphones on, put the song on repeat and drift off. It\u2019s such a great song for lulling you to a warm state of mind where you can just gently fall asleep and wake up feeling rested. If I don\u2019t listen to that one, I will go for Asteroid Belt\u2026  Parking Lot Fireworks\u2026  \u2026or an instrumental progressive house song.  ",
