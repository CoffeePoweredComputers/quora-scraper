            "answer_text": "Elves! I am lead to believe that Elves are the best wrappers in the world, along with the happy friendly staff who do this on behalf of charities and to help shoppers in kind during the Hollidays. however don\u2019t forget parants, friends family and strangers, who wrap in style. As for Rappers, their is a channel that was part of the Smodcast network, that the artist known as Kevin Smith (director) or fans of the podcast network might recall. As the rappers featured in the episodes, coming in were truly some of the best at rapping including beatboxing to a phenomenal level of skill. After a bit of searching, I found the chanel, it\u2019s called \u201cThe Breaks\u201d https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/tha-breaks-smodcast.com/id462906108 For me me personally I like Eminem Songs, along with a variety of artists who\u2019s names don\u2019t come to hand at present, except Icklenellyrose on twitter, who\u2019s pretty good. So I hope this is useful. ",
