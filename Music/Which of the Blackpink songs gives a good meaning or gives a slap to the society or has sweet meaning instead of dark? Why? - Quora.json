            "answer_text": "I think the song that embodies a sweet message in the song instead of dark would be Stay, not only because of its sentimental and emotional ballad vibe that it gives off, but also for its message about love and longing for a lost one. Stay is about longing for time spent with someone who without doing much of anything, but yet the moments they have spent are still precious and special. It is about how spending that time with friends, rather than lovers can still feel special to them, and as they grow, they are slowly drifting apart, which calls for lost time with one another. This is represented by the members walking around with a hopeless and forlorn expression in their own respective scenes. It is folksy song with, a good blend of voices that all fall into a lower range, which makes the song more emotional and sad for the listeners. Each fo the vocals flow well int another and they all come together to make a good and cohesive piece, interwoven with emotion and sentiment. They also make a reference to Heaven by Talking Heads, in a scene on the marquis in the beginning, \u201cHeaven is a place were nothing even happens,\u201d and also referenced their lyrics in their song as well with a guitar instruments accompanying it, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine nothing at all, could be so exciting, could be so fun.\u201d This expresses how being together with their friends, even just in their presence is enough to make then happy and for them to make good use of their time, and that just being together feels right and feels meant to be, and thus the wandering around of each member, shows that expression of loneliness they feel from the absence of the other. It seems theta their brand is much similar to Red Velvet as both have their black and pink side where black represents their girl crush, bad boy side and the pink is their delicate and elegant, and soft vibe where it involves more ballads. I think overall, it is a good message about friendship and how having friends by you is important to fit in the emptiness that they feel without them, and importance of one\u2019s extinct in someone life, thus longing for them stay with them for all of eternity. It is a sweet and heartfelt message, yet it is also true to society, because we all feel moments of loneliness, but it is important to spend time with them to fill in that gap, and feel like yourself and happy, when in the world, it feels like happiness is so rare when you are not with that person. It really shows their vocals qualities and is moving the group to a different sound. ",

            "answer_text": "You Never know 100%. \u201cHmm, the words that everyone said so easilyMaybe you can hear it soonI've heard enough I've heard enoughOf the things that I'm not\u201d That is so true these days. Words aren\u2019t an object, but still a dangerous weapon. It can be lethal. Words are a blessing and a curse. \u201cEven if the whole world changesI'm still the same\u201d Sometimes, people feel the need to change with everybody else, when they\u2019re just fine the way they are. \u201cBut you'll never know unless you walk in my sho\u0435sYou'll never know, my tangled strings'Caus\u0435 everybody sees what they wanna seeIt's easier to judge me than to believeThe old thoughts I hid deeplySometimes grabbing me and tormenting meThe more I do, I'ma shine, babyYou know they ain't got a shot on me\u201d THIS. THE FIRST PART IS GOLD. Everyone judges no matter what. It\u2019s an instinct. Someone is always judging, even without knowing. It\u2019s really easy. Thoughts are as lethal as words. \u201cYou can't sink, I know wellI can't fly while looking at the groundAcross the clouds, it's still brightI've been drawing in the pictureEven in the torn placesSo I can empty everything and laughI wanna face me, who I didn't want to see, ehI remember, so I'll be okayMake flowers bloom in my blue roomI'll always be waiting\u201d These are such meaningful representations. These lyrics mean so much. You can\u2019t move on if you keep looking back, because across the difficulties are the rewards. The torn places are your problems and the terrible things in life, but you can still make something out of them. This ending takes a positive turn and I love it. ",
