Music is amazing thing,music doesn\u2019t have nor religion,nation or race,nor language. You shouldn\u2019t stop listening to music cuz music can really shape your day and make your life more colorful and amazing. My mood actually depends on music I listened to before. ",

Have a good cry perhaps and release some toxins from your body. Or find some music which makes you feel happier. ",
