            "answer_text": "A2A \u2014 How do we finger these bass cleff notes on the piano? It depends on how you want the chords to sound. If you like them to be fully staccato then it doesn't matter which fingers are used. A beginner would be comfortable with 531 on all chords, an experienced player would use a combination of 531 and 421, a player with large hands might use 532, 431, 321. (Note that simply using 531 only will be more likely to create unwanted tension in the hand. Using a variety of combinations helps to relax the muscles and assist control over dynamics.) If you want some legato between the chord changes then you need to use either of the above combinations and change fingering on the repeated chord at some point before the last beat of the bar. The pedal will also have an impact on your choices, as will the desired dynamics. ",
