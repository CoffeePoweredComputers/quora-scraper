            "answer_text": "Now that I been away from Indonesia for 3 years and only recently returned temporarily, I see how Indonesians feel about them now. This only in general around Indonesia and not every one. There is a bit of mistrust of black people. If they are black Americans then some people will think they will be criminals or in gangs back home. I worked in hotels and often if it is a black person they will make sure they have credit card details to cover their stay when they check in. Some believe they will try to check out without paying. (I only had this twice with black people in Indonesia). I know some police and they will be suspicious with black people, thinking they might be drug dealers or something like that. In Bali, the street peddlers sometimes do not hassle them as much as white people because they think they will be violent to them. Often it is black foreigners who do attack the street vendors but I admit the vendors sometimes do deserve it. Some woman sort of are turned on by black men. They like to date them for some fun if away from their parents but are not interested so much to marry them as they think they will live in a bad area back home. While they are in Indo, they think they are cool fun dates. So good for good time, but not for long time. They think poorly of the black people from West Papua/Irian Jaya and think they are below other Indonesians. The government does look after them, but people in general think they are lower class. As you can see in Indonesia they can be racist but it is the same in Malaysia, Brunei and other Asian countries so it is not just Indonesia. Now I been in Australia a few years I see how Australians treat every one how they deserve and not because of their colour. I read people in here saying whites or Australians are racist but really they got nooooooo idea how could none whites have it in white countries. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually, my uncle is an African-American, and I found him pretty much a laid-back and easygoing person. He also introduced me to his extended family back in Pennsylvania that are very friendly and open to new people \u2014 they keep a close-knitted helpful family too. I found that black people are interesting and very welcoming people. My experience as an exchange student gave me chance to befriend with Senegali, Ghanaian, and Tanzanian. I found them similar to Indonesian: very open to other culture and very curious to know what other culture offers. They are also easy to talk to and to hang out with. Most of Africans I know are quite outgoing and open to experiences too. Since I was in high school, I am always an African-American and other African diaspora culture enthusiast. I even follow OkayAfrica to keep update on African modern culture. Other than being a big fan of R&B and Hip-hop culture (a Mary J. Blige and Jazmine Sullivan big fan here!), I like some African-Brits and musicians of African diaspora in Europe too, like Seinabo Sey (a Swedish-Gambian singer), Jacob Banks (British-Nigerian singer) and Kwabs (a British-Ghanaian singer). Another thing, I also understands the African disapora jokes like what MaximBady did. Oh, and I love the idea of Pax Africana too! That\u2019s why, I expect Black Panther with sooo much excitement. The Afro-futurism and the secretly advanced Africa under Wakanda is just\u2026 amazing. I also love to trace the contemporary music roots of Africa. We all know that African diaspora led to the discovery of Jazz, but I like the proto-Jazz instead. It\u2019s Fela Kuti, one of my music \u2018deity\u2019. Back in 2014, Fela\u2019s songs are my jam when I was working on my college tasks, my favorite songs are Yellow Fever and Water No Get Enemy. One time in Ubud Writers and Readers Festival, I met a Nigerian-American writer, Helon Habila, and he was shocked there\u2019s an Indonesian that even knows Fela, we end up talk about our favorite songs. I am also glad that there is a Tony Awards-winning Off-Broadway show made in tribute for him titled \u201cFela!\u201d. Enough with my personal sentiment of how I like African diaspora culture, let\u2019s see the socio-historical context of how Indonesian feel about black people. Black people are often seen in bigger cities in Indonesia, they are just tourist or very small minority of diplomatic or private workers. Indonesian are not very used to seeing black people around, I found that many people still stare on them strangely.Bad stereotype for modern African diaspora in Indonesia is mainly revolve around the drug smuggling issue. Considering that many Africans were caught doing that bad business here :(There was Black Dutchmen (or Belanda Hitam) brought from Elmina (Ghana region) to Java. Over 3000 black soldiers were brought to Dutch East Indies from West Africa in mid 1800s. I don\u2019t know if they still have descendants here in Indonesia or not, but surely, West African soldiers are an unsung part of Indonesian colonial history. This is a very interesting thing, I would love to research more.As a fellow colonised-nation, African nations and Indonesia have maintain good relationship since we made Bandung Conference on April 1955 to establish the beginning of Non-Aligned Nations and a strong anti-colonialism movement. Recently, we made Indonesia Africa Forum to strengthen the political and economic relations of Indonesia and African nations. Therefore, I think that we have a well-maintained political relations since long time ago. That, politically we saw black nations as part of allies.",
