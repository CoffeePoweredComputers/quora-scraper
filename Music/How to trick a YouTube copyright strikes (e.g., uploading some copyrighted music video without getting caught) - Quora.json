(it does daily) but\u2026 above everything else\u2026 do you think anybody here will truly give you his magical formula to fool youtube? not happening. if somebody from youtube reads this then the method will become worthless in less than a week. this is the kind of thing you can only ask in private.

YouTube\u2019s detection equipment is very sophisticated - suggestions about making minor changes are nonsense - even if they weren\u2019t there\u2019s nothing to stop the copyright holder finding it or being informed of it. I used an image belonging to someone else (no way of finding the copyright holder) I did ask if the copyright holder would contact me if he found out, about six months later he contacted me, said how much he liked my video and even offered me more images. So it proves it isn\u2019t always up to automatic image or audio detectors to find copyright infringements. ",
