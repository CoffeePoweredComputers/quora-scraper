            "answer_text": "Hi , My advice is to look at singing as a passion and becoming a singer as an ambition rather looking at it as a job. 1. Build your self confidence by singing in small shows, college or corporate events and slowly move to performing in pubs, concerts etc. 2. Build a reputation for yourself by making videos of your performance and put them on your YouTube channel and other sites such ArtistsCreed.com.People will watch , like and comment on your videos. Don't be disheartened if some of the comments are negative :) 3. Facebook marketing is another option for getting people's attention, Create a Band page and use paid advertising/cross promotion and so on to reach out as many people as possible in your city, district, state, country i.e. choose your target audience wisely. 4. Take a chance by releasing your music video on YouTube, ArtistsCreed.com and if you have the budget then TV/Radio launch may do wonders. 5. Participate in music competitions, This will bring you in the limelight and hopefully get you noticed by a music director, record label, actor or film director and set things rolling for you. On ArtistsCreed.com you can create your profile, upload your works and get user feedback. They are active in India and are also coming up with a American version of their site to cater to upcoming American singers/Bands and American audiences. (ArtistsCreed.us)You can get in touch with them on support@artistscreed.com, support@artistscreed.us or message them on their FB page http://facebook.com/ArtistsCreedInc. A few singers have used the tactics mentioned above and succeeded. It took some time for them but things eventually worked out. There is no shortcut unless you know somebody in Bollywood personally :) All the Best for your musical journey! Thanks,BHR ",
