            "answer_text": "That\u2019s quite an interesting thought really. It has never occured to me about lip-syncing for other performers, but to be honest there is probably a very good reason - it isn\u2019t practical or possible. Lets run through some other performer types and why Lip Sync wouldn\u2019t work. Actors - Technically this is done in movies, when scenes may need to be redubbed due to audio quality, but in everything live - its just too unpredictable. When you are perofmring live you need to be able to adapt, plus the slightest mistake could unravel your performance quickly Musical /Broadway Performers - it\u2019s already done in songs sometimes, but again with speech - not much point. Usually what will happen is if a performer strains their voice, instead of an understudy the performer does the less strenuous parts of the role, and the recording is used for when they may struggle. Its usually done in smaller venues where they do not have understudies/do not trust understudies mimes - well do I need to say more? Magicians - Sounds like a great idea, keep everything scripted, but like with other performers the need to be flexible outweighs everything else. tough audience? Nervous volunteer? Or what about cracking a joke about someones name or what they do for a living - can\u2019t be done pre-recorded Comedians - Same as Magicians Dancers - Same as Mimes\u2026 To be honest - performers like flexibility when it comes to everything including the spoken word. When things are synced there is no room for error, no room for improvisation - its cold and formularic. Being able to speak freely means you can adapt as needed and give a better performance. ",

            "answer_text": "They do. In most Hollywood movies that are not one single shot of an ensemble performing, most or all of the various shots the scene cuts to are the performers miming to a prerecorded track. On TV, Judy Garland would sometimes pre-record her songs to mime during taping (this is attested to in Mel Torm\u00e9\u2019s memoir) and if the band was to be seen onstage with her they would be miming too. Pre-recording the track has probably been very common technique in TV variety shows (and Super Bowls) where the musicians have to do more than sit and play. the marching band in this clip is obviously just faking it\u2026  American Bandstand was famous/notorious for having musicians (including instrumentalists) just mime to recordings of their hits.
