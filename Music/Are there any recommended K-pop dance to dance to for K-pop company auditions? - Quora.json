            "answer_text": "Well, based on my experience you have to WOW the judges so you can get accepted. For Girl Groups ONLY ( sorry Boy groups are hard to impersonate for me) Rumor by Produce 48  (G)-IDLE HANN or LATATA   EXID I LOVE YOU  Egotistic by Mamamoo  SIREN SUNMI  LA VIE EN ROSE IZONE  There's more from Chungha,RED VELVET, and other songs from the artist I chose from above. The reason I didn't choose any popular groups like Blackpink and TWICE is because of their popularity. I'm sure if you did choose from their dances surely someone will have the same chosen dance as you. For my experience in my club if someone has the same song chosen as the other they will choose who's version or who's dancing is better. Although these people or groups I chose are also popular like IZONE,Mamamoo and GIDLE these groups will give you an advantage since our KPOP president said there's a higher chance you'll get accepted if you dance good OR you dance to unpopular groups. If you dance to unpopular groups they will say or think you know a lot about KPOP. Another reason you shouldn't dance to popular songs is that some judges would think you only know about popular groups and have no knowledge of older and underrated KPOP groups. Yes, some aren't fair but it's just how it works. TIPS FOR PERFORMING If you dance to these KPOP groups you need to act like them, like your part of their group. If you dance to Mamamoo or EXID be fierce If you dance to IOI, TWICE, the velvet side or RED VELVET act cute and smile If you dance to Sistar act cute but sexy and smile. Notice in their MV that they act sexy but they look cute while doing it. If you want like BP and (G)-IDLE then you need to have swag while you dance. Mouth the lyrics. You need to act like your the one singing the song. Expression. Like I said imitate the vibe your chosen dance is.Observe everything from the group dancing and imitate it while your performing. Enjoy. ",

            "answer_text": "(I\u2019m going to just say that actually, they don\u2019t need you to dance Kpop just because they are a Korean entertainment company. If english songs work better for you, they don\u2019t really care. After all, Kpop is not a genre of dance, only an expression of it. So you should do what best expresses yourself. But anyway to answer the question\u2026) From a dancing perspective, I recommend choosing songs with strong choreography. Reason being that strong choreography really tests your body\u2019s flexibility, adaptability and the coordination/isolation of your various muscle groups performing these dances. However, also bear in mind that not every song is particularly difficult. Examples that come to mind are Orange Caramel\u2019s songs; they aren\u2019t particularly difficult, and you wouldn\u2019t really show any ability that causes them to give you a second look. For this reason, many new idol groups (particularly boy groups) have members with experience in \u2018flashy\u2019 dances, like hiphop and B-Boying. Regarding freestyle dances, I\u2019d say prepare a bit, but don\u2019t expect too much about it. Shows like MixNine, PD101, etc tend to show people asking for (and receiving) random songs to \u2018test\u2019 their dancing skills. The reality is that it doesn\u2019t really show much, and is just more footage for the PDs to show people that they like so. If you\u2019re good, you\u2019re good, and usually the people observing will know. Remember that they are creating a Kpop group that has dances choreographed for them. Creation isn\u2019t as important as the ability to pick up quickly in the Kpop world. ",

Oneus-A song written easily(This is a song that looks like your flying,but your not.Idk how to explain >o<) Seventeen-Highlight Loona-Butterfly(would lovvee to see this!!) Red Velvet-Rookie Itzy-Not shy Middle dances: Twice-Fancy( This song is a mature type of song.It\u2019s not to hard or to easy.Try and and focus on the facial expressions and how the mood is.) Jennie-Solo( I little this is a good song for audition.You got to have that confidence) BTS-Boy with luv(I don\u2019t know if this is an easy song,but you move around a lot. In this song you have to really bright and happy inside.) Kard-Bomb Bomb(It looks hard,but i think it has some easy parts to it.I think it\u2019s doable. Blackpink-How you like that(This is a powerful song.When dancing to this your moves have to strong and just fierce.) Easy/Practice dances: Oh my girl-Nonstop Gfriend-Fever( I learned this dance myself.I think it\u2019s pretty easy.) Red Velvet-Umpah( This one was okayly easy to do.) Hwasa-Twit(Easy movements) G-idle-Oh my god(I think this song will improve your facial expressions) I really don\u2019t know if these are good for an audition,but I really tried. Anyways it\u2019s up to you on what song you want to dance to. To me these are all good songs with great choreography. I think it\u2019s about how you bring it. How much emotion and power you bring with the dance. Well good luck for your audition!! FIGHTINGGGGGG. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many different styles of dance, and you should choose a song which represents your style perfectly. If you\u2019re not good with songs that are upbeat and fast, don\u2019t do dances that are upbeat and fast. In auditions, you need to choose songs which suit YOU the best, not which songs or dances that are the most popular. The focus should be YOU and YOUR skills. I\u2019ve also read from other places that companies don\u2019t really like when applicants dance to a song that their group has released. For example, don\u2019t dance Ddu-ddu-ddu to YG Entertainment since they are the ones who made that song and choreographed it. Chances are, they are the experts of that song and dance. Don\u2019t make them compare you with their own experienced and professional dancers. If anything, do a song that is not done a lot. This will be a fresh sound in the ears of the people who are watching hours and hours of auditions. ",

Practice everyday because if you practice a lot, you\u2019ll get better. It doesn\u2019t really matter which language the song\u2019s (or songs) in as long as you look good and it shows your talent as a dancer. Good luck.

However if you do get the chance to perform a prepared dance, then yes, hip-hop is a very popular style, but you could also do something completely different (such as ballet, maybe?). Whatever you do you need to set yourself apart from everyone else so doing the most popular style may actually be a negative thing. ",

You could try something different. Try a hip hop cover. Who is your favorite dancer? As long as you don\u2019t making money it\u2019s not illegal. ",
