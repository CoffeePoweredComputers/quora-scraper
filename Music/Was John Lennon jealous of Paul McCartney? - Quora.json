            "answer_text": "Yes, he was. The later you go in the Beatles\u2019 discography the more you see Paul carrying the band. I think after Sgt. Pepper the quality of John\u2019s contributions really went down. I feel like John was too caught up in being opposite of the great early Beatles\u2019 material. He didn\u2019t want to do any more \u201cnice\u201d songs; he was embarrassed by having ridden such songs to fame. He mostly wanted to be edgy, like with \u201cyellow matter custard dripping from a dead dog\u2019s eye\u201d and \u201cChrist you know it ain\u2019t easy\u201d type stuff. I used to think it was because John was deeper into drugs than Paul. But in this century of course Paul can\u2019t stop talking about how important drugs were for the Beatles\u2014there goes that theory, lol. (I remember hearing rumors when John was going through an unproductive \u201chouse-husband\u201d period prior to his final album that drugs had really put him in a lethargy.) One thing is undeniable: a huge physical transformation takes place in John Lennon. Compare the early Beatles John: really the most handsome of the four and stocky, built like a US high school football player. Flash forward to the Sgt. Pepper album cover: he has turned into an unpleasant-looking anorexic. God only knows how much weight he has lost. SOMETHING BIG HAS HAPPENED. I\u2019m surprised I have never heard anybody comment on that. I just read he was on heroin during the making of Sgt. Pepper, doubtless worse than whatever Paul was doing. He stayed scrawny the rest of his life. So I think drugs took a bigger toll on John than on Paul. (For comparison, it was said that John was an especially bad drunk.) It\u2019s a shame that all over Wikipedia you have acid comments John made about Paul\u2019s Beatles songs, comments that I think may come mostly from one or two interviews made at the height of their post-breakup bitterness. John was known to mouth off with tendentious criticisms that he probably thought better of later. It\u2019s too bad he\u2019s not around to walk them back. ",

            "answer_text": "All the answers to this question are simplistic and therefore lack perspective. Yes, John was jealous of Paul. Paul was also jealous of John. I would argue that LSD played a major role in their relationship beginning with Paul's first trip with John. I've linked the full story below but it was at McCartney's house, just the two of them, and Paul clearly had a bit of a bad trip. He went upstairs and went to bed, lol, that's not what you do on a great acid trip. One of Paul's quotes from the experience, \"it was a very freaky experience and I was totally blown away. John had been sitting around very enigmatically and I had a big vision of him as king, the absolutely Emperor of Eternity. It was a good trip.\u201d Well, he was upstairs by himself imagining this, and that's quite the opposite of a good trip. Also, it's actually pretty well in line with Paul's issues as a human - he was a sort of a pretender. Now, before any Paul fans lose their minds, relax, we all have our flaws, in fact, you could argue that John had far more masks than any Beatle. However, John's hang ups were more superficial, not so prevalent in the deepest interpersonal, close friendships we're discussing here (and what he said to the media can largely be discounted in this regard). To some extent, this experience haunted Paul for the remainder of his life and it was a thousand times heavier mental baggage than any John had with him. Now, was John jealous of Paul as a musician and composer? Damn straight he was\u2026.just as every artist in existence was and should continue to be. But the gap that some others here have quite rightly pointed out was not so significant to cause the man to lose sleep. Besides, he was much more interested in confronting the inner turmoil of the human soul than he was crafting a classic song. John said as much thousand times over and he wasn't bullshitting in some attempt to run away from the truth of Paul's superior artistry. That's just not what happened. Unfortunately, those who have never taken psychedelics could never fully understand their relationship. With that stated\u2026.this whole question is nonsense. People love to try and define the animosity from what was perhaps the most famous partnership in the history of our civilization\u2026.but it's a fool's errand. They were just great friends who loved each other, made some of the greatest art ever produced, and had a fucking blast doing it. All the references I've made here are as counterpoint to what seems like the prevailing - and decidedly incorrect - narrative that John was super jelly of Macca. He wasn't, he was\u2026.they both were, they both weren't\u2026\u2026we all are if we want to be, we're all one single wave of love if we want to be.
