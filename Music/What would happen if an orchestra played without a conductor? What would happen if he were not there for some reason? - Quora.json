            "answer_text": "What would happen if an orchestra played without a conductor? What would happen if he were not there for some reason? The music would be less artistic, if it didn\u2019t completely fall apart Small jazz combos, and small classical ensembles, and small rock bands all play without conductors. But somebody has to count them in. In rock/metal bands, you usually see the drummer click his sticks together several times to start the song. In classical ensembles (like trios, quartets, quintets, etc.), one player will mark the start by sort of bouncing their body and instrument. A jazz band leader will count in like a conductor, and then get out of the way. But large jazz bands have conductors, or very strong rhythm leaders. Full classical orchestras really need them. The jazz players keep time by listening to the rhythm player, whether that is piano, guitar, bass, or whatever. But classical pieces aren\u2019t written to have the same strong rhythm line. Simply put, that would get boring. For a large classical orchestra, they could set a metronome, and have the 1st chair violin or 1st chair clarinet start everyone like a small classical ensemble does. But then the entire piece would run at the same tempo and dynamic. A jazz band gets around this by solos. They stay at the same tempo throughout the entire piece, but after the first verse and repetition, everyone knows that they will go into solos, and in what order. Most of the players will get quieter, and the first soloist will do all kinds of cool stuff. They won\u2019t change tempo at all, but the solo can include lost of cool stuff with volume. As the solo moves to each player, this keeps the audience interested. You can\u2019t do this with a large orchestra. But if they played at the same tempo and volume for the entire piece, that would get boring also. The conductor is there to speed up and slow down the music for maximum expressiveness. He or she is also there to raise and lower the volume of all or part of the orchestra to increase expressiveness. Amateur performers couldn\u2019t even stat on a single tempo without a conductor, but professionals could definitely do that. But even professionals would not be able to speed up or slow down together. They each would speed up or slow down a different amount, and then everything would collapse. Dynamic changes could theoretically be done without the guidance of a conductor, and frequently are. But the conductor is there to pay attention to the energy of the audience, and respond to that. A rock band can do that without a conductor, because there are many fewer of them. In a large orchestra, the conductor reads the audience, and uses his or her best artistry when controlling not only the tempo, but also the volume. ",

            "answer_text": "This happens more than you might think. The role of a conductor, other than a beat keeper really became important, perhaps overly so, in the 19th century. For centuries, it was not unusual to have no conductor. The concertmaster or a soloist might set the tempi and coordinate the start of movements. A first class orchestra has a great sense of ensemble and they are trained to listen to each other. In some orchestras, especially those that specialize in music earlier than Beethoven, the performances have no conductor. Even more recent orchestral literature can be played by a good ensemble without too much help from someone waving his/her arms in front of the players. In the 1980s, there was a tour of the Cleveland Orchestra (one of the best in the USA) with Lorin Maazel conducting. In a show of skill, the program included Concerto for Orchestra by B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k \u2014 not a simple work written in the 1940s, by any standards. He would give downbeats and occasionally indicate a tempo nuance, by for the most part, he stood on the podium, watching the players with his arms at his side. Long story short, the role of conductor with a good orchestra can be overemphasized. There are conductors that inspire an almost mystic ethos around their recordings and performances, but how much difference it makes is a matter for speculation. Here is a recording of Concerto for Orchestra just to give you an idea of how accomplished the Cleveland Orchestra can be. In the concert I attended it was played with minimal input from a conductor::  ",
