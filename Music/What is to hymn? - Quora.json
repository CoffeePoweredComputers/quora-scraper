            "answer_text": "A hymn is a song of \u201cpraise,\u201d of a religious nature. The term comes from Greek \u1f55\u03bc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, and the Greeks were the first practitioners of hymnody in the Western tradition, though the Egyptians, Babylonians, and ancient peoples of India also wrote and ritually performed songs of this nature. In post-Reformation Protestantism, the hymn has taken on much of the character and material of popular music or vernacular folk song. \u201cHymn\u201d can refer either to the text, to the musical tune to which the text is set, or to both at once. The texts are typically structured by a simple, rhyming poetic meter and have multiple verses, each of which fits the same tune. They are often sung congregationally, by the whole church body, as part of a worship service. A hymnal is a collection of hymns, usually in book form. ",
