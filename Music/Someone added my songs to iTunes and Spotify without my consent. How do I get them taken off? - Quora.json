            "answer_text": "If you have serious money at stake, your legal department contacts the service about the violation. If it's just you as an independent (i had this issue on YouTube as an indie) you do your best to report the infringement. Has your music been registered with ASCAP or BMI or released through an agency like CDBaby? That would help. Also, are those same songs already on those sites? Basically you'll have to have proof those are yours. Imagine if you were in their position and have to discover what's going on. If there is big money involved they move much faster. My issue on youtube was probably worth under eighteen cents in earned royalties. After a couple years, the video was gone and no one told me if it was because of my complaint or not. A marketing friend of mine said \u201cit's the money.\u201d There's very little motivation for big corporations to be much help unless the almighty buck inspires further action. If the person who put up your songs is stealing them and not giving you credit for them, do whatever reporting you can to the sites. Proof would be critical. If that person IS giving you credit as the owner - you might consider letting the songs ride and take the free marketing. Best wishes!! ",

            "answer_text": "I would go to the sites and look at the DMCA copyright notices. On Spotify, go to the home page and click on \u201cLegal\u201d at the bottom. You will see the terms of Service. Section 10 allows copyright owners to submit their claims of infringement, as provided under the DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act). The US law provides a mechanism for copyright owners to submit a claim (provided they offer enough proof of their ownership and identify the infringing work). If the sites want a qualified immunity from a copyright lawsuit, they need to remove the infringing work. If you go to Apple Music, you also will see a link to submit copyright claim: Legal - Intellectual Property - Apple. It\u2019s probably the most efficient means to get infringing work \u2014- an that is if truly infringing \u2014- taken down quickly. ",
