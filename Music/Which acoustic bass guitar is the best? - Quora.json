            "answer_text": "I've owned several acoustic bass guitars.  I keep one for convenience when I need to grab a bass and sit on the patio or figure out a song in a hurry.  The first, and best, was a Martin BM.  It was a plain Jane with a satin finish and a transducer. No tone, volume or EQ controls.  Just a 1/4\" jack in the end pin.  It had a wonderful tone and good volume without electric amplification.  I eventually sold it to \"upgrade\" to a Martin 16GTAE bass.  This bass had a better finish and better electronics but lacked the warm tone and volume of the BM when I played it unplugged.  I was never completely happy with it. I sold the 16GTAE and now I have a National resonator bass with a highlander pickup.  It's the loudest acoustic bass I have owned but it does have a slightly metallic tone like a resonator guitar.  It's not bad but it can be a little harsh sounding in a jam session, depending on the type of music being played. The Taylor AB basses (discontinued) are highly valued by collectors but they don't have much volume unplugged.  I almost bought one a couple of times when you could still find them in stores.  That's how I first found the Martin BM, shopping for a Taylor AB.  I couldn't talk myself into spending $2k on the Taylor so I picked up the Martin BM just to hear it and I was amazed at the sound.  It only cost $800, so it was a bargain.  I should have held onto her when I still had the chance. Long story, short ending.  If you can find a Martin BM (discontinued) for sale somewhere give her a try.  I think you'll be happy with it.  I know I was.  Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Best that I\u2019ve actually tried myself (and bought) is a Warwick Alien. Much better than it really should be, that off-axis sound hole really works. Nothing like a real acoustic bass though:  That will absolutely kick the pants off any acoustic bass guitar. Yes, they\u2019re huge, and expensive, and hard to play\u2026 but that is the tone, and there\u2019s no other way to get it. ",
