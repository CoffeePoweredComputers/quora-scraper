            "answer_text": "Won\u2019t? No, not really. I'm assuming here you mean absolute refusal under all circumstances no matter what. There are many I don\u2019t listen to by choice. Most of them because they just aren\u2019t interesting enough or don\u2019t tick other boxes for what I consider quality music. Some of them I strongly prefer not to listen to not just because they don\u2019t make the cut but because I find them in one way or another displeasing. Not a lot of names come to mind and I\u2019m not going to list them here. Some musicians I have no problem with in general but they have produced tracks I would prefer not to hear. But for the most part? Even if I don\u2019t find the music to fit my concept of worth listening to I won\u2019t object if someone else wishes to listen to/play it in my presence, e.g., at a friend\u2019s place, a party, etc. And I will only leave if I am completely bored by everything. E.g., all my friends have gone home and I was only staying because I was still enjoying the music. When the music is under my control and I don\u2019t have anyone else present whose tastes I should be considering, I will of course listen to only what I want to hear. ",
