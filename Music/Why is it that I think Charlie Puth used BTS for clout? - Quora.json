            "answer_text": "Charlie is known in some circles for being a money grubbing fame whore. He has said things that were less than well received. Some feel he was using BTS to broaden his fanbase and boost his profile in the Asian music market. He got lots of publicity but it remains to be seen if he gains fans or makes more inroads in that market. Also there are people who feel that the western music industry uses BTS for ratings, clicks and sales but keep them at a distance when it comes to their awards and accolades. Whether this is true remains to be seen. ",

But it\u2019s best to leave Charlie alone if we trash talk his name, we will just be called toxic and shit. Not defending him, but the whole thing of him deleting his tweet about BTS as a misunderstanding, he\u2019s twitter page just malfunctioned. ",
