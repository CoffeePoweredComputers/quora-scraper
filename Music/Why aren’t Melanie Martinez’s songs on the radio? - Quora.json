However, you probably won\u2019t hear most of them because she isn\u2019t too mainstream and most her of songs are controversial and explicit. At least, that\u2019s my best guess, but they have played on the radio before. Perhaps you\u2019re on the wrong station. ",

Her songs will occasionally come on some stations, but if I were you, I'd start listening to some indie or alternative stations and see if her songs are played there. If they are, let me know. <3 ",
