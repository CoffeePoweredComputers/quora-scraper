            "answer_text": "Not only was he good - he changed blues/rock guitar forever. Let me quote that one of his Army buddies (he was in the 101st Airborne, but was discharged for an ankle injury) said that he slept with his guitar, and talked to it\u2026 But what made him \u201cspecial\u201d in his way of playing, was that unlike other guitarists who either played rhythm or solo licks, Jimi did both at the same time. Take \u201cLittle Wing\u201d, \u201cThe Wind Cries Mary\u201d, or \u201cAxis: Bold as Love\u201d as an example; he doesn\u2019t just strum or arpeggiate his chords, but rather dresses his rhythm with so many little additions and licks, making them something organic and fuller. He would also use his thumb to do a moving base line whilst chording. Stevie Ray Vaughn (and more recently John Mayer) would introduce that into their style very effectively. Add to that the way he understood guitar as an extension of his hands. He said that when he was starting he would not try to do the solos other blues guitarists were playing, but rather try to do what the saxophone player was doing, and that itself made for a whole new level of expressiveness. He may be most remembered by the less keen on him for \u201cmaking a lot of noise\u201d, but it was no more than him stretching the limits of what could be done at the moment - experimenting new textures, that would become Rock staples down the line. Very few guitarists that came after him do not mention him as a big influence. Clapton, during the Cream years when graffiti saying \u201cClapton is God\u201d covered London, had his derri\u00e8re handed to him by a young Hendrix who managed to jam on stage with them. Pete Townsend and Clapton (declared enemies at the time), met up secretly in a Cinema in London to discuss that this \u201cfrizzy haired young black kid\u201d was destroying their \u201cReign\u201d. You can hear all kinds of quotes from legend status guitarists about how Hendrix impacted the scene and blew them away with his understanding and use of the guitar. Needless to say, you don\u2019t need quotes from others to know he was a great guitarist - just the fact that you\u2019re asking it should mean something. Youtube is your friend, and I\u2019d strongly recommend you try to find concert snippets and the likes, but particularly recommendable would be to get your eyes and ears on the Monterey 1967 Pop Festival, or his closing act in Woodstock. Judge for yourself\u2026 :) ",

            "answer_text": "I think I know where you are going with this.. what you want to know is if (without pop culture training or any other influence) I would put certain guitar players on these \u2018pedestals\u2019 of greatness. I think here is a case of where music education has played a big part of good in society and why we need music education. I don\u2019t think I would have thought his playing was \u2018at first glance\u2019 on par with other electric players because More classical clear/efficient/technical playing seems to strike me as \u2018being one of the best\u2019. Therefore, I would have not \u2018gotten\u2019 his overall vibe and approach to guitar, because I would have just gravitated to other technical players. So because I didn\u2019t live in a bubble musically and because we have audio and visual to modern music, I was able to appreciate the importance of that kind of playing\u2014showing how attitude and being able to reach emotionally out to someone is probably more important overall than technical ability. Striving for technical fluency on the guitar is awesome; however, what do you have at the end of the day?!?\u2026 you have the person who plays that way probably practicing at night and trying more and more to be less and less human. That\u2019s what you have. And you may have some people who just are impressed but not inspired to go pick up a guitar themselves. With the avant-guard emotional players you have endless inspiration and people picking up the guitar because it touches them emotionally. So I hope you understand that the free-market of guitar players putting their stuff out there is the best way.. and we need music education in whatever form it comes in.. we just need it to be important in society.. When a question such as this is asked, you should be assured that you will get fair answer(s). ",
