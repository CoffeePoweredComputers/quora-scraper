            "answer_text": "Some of the biggest influences on the grunge movement were punk, heavy metal and Neil Young. Grunge is much slower and more distorted than punk, though, showing the musical influence of heavy metal bands like Black Sabbath. Neil Young has been informally crowned the \u201cGodfather of Grunge\u201d and on 1994\u2019s Sleeps with Angels he demonstrates why he deserves such an honor. The album is full of subtle beauty and fragile, whispered lyrics. It is a tender plea to the times we live in yet seems from another era with it\u2019s disembodied feedback. On the album\u2019s epic signature piece, the 14-minute poem \u201cChange Your Mind\u201d, Young shows himself the complete master of dark guitar atmospherics and bloody raw emotional vulnerability. A reason he has been called \u201cthe Godfather of Grunge\u201d is due to his use of highly distorted guitar, especially on the album Rust Never Sleeps released on July 2, 1979, which opens and closes with two lyrically similar songs, \u201cHey Hey My My (Into the Black)\u201d and \u201cMy My Hey Hey (Out of the Blue).  Both songs offer the same message: one\u2019s death should come quickly while one is young, in a moment of dramatic destiny, and in the throes of a ruling passion, instead of at an old age where youth and passion have faded away. Thus, it is better to die as Septimus or Michael Furey, Gretta\u2019s childhood lover, died than to lead a passionless existence a la Gabriel or Gretta. Then \u2026. Former Nirvana frontman Cobain took his own life in 1994 and, in the final letter he left to his fans, friends and family, reprinted the phrase \u201cIt\u2019s better to burn out than to fade away\u201d from Young\u2019s track \u2018Hey Hey, My My\u2019. Neil Young returned to the studio in November 1993 with his primordial garage-rock brethren Crazy Horse for what promised to be another amp-melting catharsis. But the news of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain\u2018s suicide seemed to change all that. Young has been informally crowned the \u201cGodfather of Grunge\u201d and on 1994\u2019s Sleeps with Angels he demonstrates why he deserves such an honor. The album is full of subtle beauty and fragile, whispered lyrics. It is a tender plea to the times we live in yet seems from another era with it\u2019s disembodied feedback. On the album\u2019s epic signature piece, the 14-minute poem \u201cChange Your Mind\u201d, Young shows himself the complete master of dark guitar atmospherics and bloody raw emotional vulnerability.  Pearl Jam and Neil Young have been collaborating since at least 1992 when Pearl Jam and Neil played separately at the Bob Dylan tribute (\u201cBobFest\u201d) at Madison Square Garden in New York City on October 16. It is believed that this is when Neil and Eddie Vedder first met and possibly Neil invited Pearl Jam to play at the Bridge School Benefit concert. Pearl Jam would play the Bridge School concert and mark the beginning of a long and productive relationship. Since their initial meeting, Pearl Jam\u2019s music has been heavily influenced by Neil Young as demonstrated by their numerous covers of Young songs. For example, Pearl Jam has covered \u201cRockin In The Free World\u201d over 100 times, often as final encores, according to the Pearl Jam fan site Lukin. birth name: Neil Percival Youngborn: November 12, 1945 Toronto, Ontario, Canadagenres: rock, folk rock, country rock, hard rockinstruments: vocals, guitar, harmonica, pianoactive: 1960 ~ present ",

            "answer_text": "Two answers so far both citing Neil Young - & one collapsed!? Thought I\u2019d take a look over on yonder Wikipedia out of curiosity to further investigate - & it appears to be a more difficult question to answer than I anticipated! As the author of a Grunge book revealed, there\u2019s vast differences between Grunge bands - some being more Punk, some being more Heavy Metal. Even members of those bands associated with the genre/label were not too keen on the term - Nirvana & Soundgarden being 2 prime examples. Whilst I\u2019m tempted to also mention Neil Young, it seems that he was just a Country/Folk singer who was a bit rough around the edges more often than not - also, there appears to be no mention of him here!: Grunge - Wikipedia ",
