            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t say I listen to anything non-stop. That\u2019s obsessing at my age, I\u2019m way beyond that. However, since I know you are looking for an answer that identifies a brand new or at least recently current song, I\u2019ll answer with my \u201cI play this a lot\u201d song. I picked this up one day in the record store (there are still one or two here and there in Connecticut) just because of the cover art. I thought it might be interesting to hear what was on it. I wasn\u2019t dissapointed. It was a throwback to Burt Bacharach, Brill Building Pop from the 1960\u2019s. It even made me think of Dusty Springfield for a minute or two. None of these are bad things. They were some of the most brilliant songwriters of the Popular music era. This girl delivered. In spades\u2026. So, picking one tune from an excellent solo debut album by this wonderful British singer/ songwriter, backed by Dan Auerbach (of Black Keys fame) on his label, in his studio, with his musicians, and co-written with him, there\u2019s this song I grade as a winner: Yola: \u201cFaraway Look\u201d (from Walk Through Fire, 2019)  ",

            "answer_text": "Song? Who only listens to one song a lot? I have been on an Iron Maiden kick lately, though. However, a few songs have been on constant repeat. Namely from their album, The Number of the Beast:  The Number of the Beast was the first album with Bruce Dickinson. Due to this, the band wanted to take advantage of Dickinson\u2019s greater ranger compared to previous singer, Paul Di'Anno.  The album was the first of Iron Maiden\u2019s to hit the top of the UK charts, and had a peak of 33 on the Billboard 200.  This album and Paranoid by Black Sabbath are probably the top 2 rock albums of all time. (In my opinion, you may disagree in the comments if you wish.) For those who\u2019ve yet to have this album bless thy ear drums, go forth now and rock on. I\u2019ll be with you. ",
