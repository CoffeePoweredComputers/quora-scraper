            "answer_text": "Why did The Beatles release different albums in the US? As others have said, it was a Capitol decision to change the playlists on the albums up to \u201cPepper\u201d and increase product output as a result. What we don\u2019t know is what legal wranglings and agreements took place to make this happen. We do know that The Beatles were not blindsided by this arrangement since they had to pose for album cover photo art for these \u201cextra\u201d Capitol releases (witness the \u201cYesterday and Today\u201d - Butcher album - debacle mentioned by others), so they had to know what was going to happen. I assume that Mark Lewisohn\u2019s second volume will get into who knew what when about all of this\u2026but we\u2019ll probably have to wait another 5 years for its publication. I can\u2019t wait! Although the Beatles were particular about the playlists on their albums, I would assume they were not too upset about the extra cash rolling in as a result of Capitol\u2019s money grab. Here is what I wrote about this issue in another answer on Quora: Compiling a complete Beatles catalog has to be one of the most difficult and exasperating of journeys in the Rock compendium. Let\u2019s not even get into the 45\u2019s and long-play (EP\u2019s) 7\u201d records (4 songs each), that\u2019s another story altogether. Besides the variety (and rarity of at least one) of their \u201creal\u201d first North American albums, there are two distinct lists of recordings that were released in parallel and were not equal in content until the release of Sgt. Pepper. A little history is in order. The Beatles were signed in 1962 to the Parlophone label, an EMI group owned, \u201cspoken word\u201d studio; i.e. they specialized in comedy and other recorded voice records. EMI was part of the Capitol Records conglomerate, which gave the artists immediate world-wide release potential for their EMI recordings. Notice I said \u201cpotential.\u201d The Beatles released 5 singles in England before they were finally noticed by Capitol in America: \u201cLove Me Do,\u201d \u201cPlease Please Me\u201d (first #1), \u201cFrom Me To You,\u201d \u201cShe Loves You\u201d and \u201cI Want To Hold Your hand\u201d (which was their first American #1). Their first UK album was also titled \u201cPlease Please Me,\u201d which included their first two singles \u2013 a trend that would not continue with their Parlophone album releases. The Beatles didn\u2019t want to recycle music and make their fans buy music on an album that they already owned as a single. So, most of the UK albums released later, including the second one \u2013 \u201cWith The Beatles\u201d \u2013 did not contain their hit singles; you had to buy the 45\u2019s to get those songs. One other album was released before Capitol got in the game, \u201cIntroducing The Beatles\u201d on the Vee-Jay label. Since Capitol didn\u2019t want the Beatles initial products, Parlophone used Vee-Jay, Tollie and Swan for an album and the first four singles in order to break into the North American market. That fifth single, \u201cI Want To Hold Your Hand,\u201d finally received some air time on US radio stations in late November of 1963 \u2013 especially in NY. By mid-January, it had gone to #1, just before the Beatles first US visit in February. The rest, as they say, is history. Well not quite. Capitol now wanted in on the rising tide (more like a tidal wave) and this is where keeping track of all the releases gets a bit tricky. Here is the Parlophone album list up to Sgt Pepper: Please Please Me With The Beatles A Hard Day\u2019s Night Beatles For Sale Help! Rubber Soul Revolver Here are the North American album releases: Introducing The Beatles (Vee-Jay) Meet the Beatles (Capitol) The Beatles Second Album (Capitol) Something New (Capitol) A Hard Day\u2019s Night (United Artists) The Beatles Story (Capitol) Beatles \u201965 (Capitol) The Early Beatles (Capitol) Help! (United Artists) Rubber Soul (Capitol) Yesterday & Today (Capitol) Revolver (Capitol) Confused? It only gets worse. Capitol realized they had missed the boat on a lot of music already and were determined to make the most of their lost opportunity. They couldn\u2019t get back any of the original first four singles; that boat had sailed. But they could get their hands on the rest of what had been recorded on the albums and they could also include the previous singles on new Capitol albums (they could not re-print \u201cIntroducing the Beatles\u201d, but they could repackage the individual songs). The Parlophone albums all had 14 songs \u2013 more or less. Capitol reduced that song list to 12 per album \u2013 sometimes 11. By reducing the count and taking off a few other songs and including the past singles and the new ones coming out in their stead, Capitol was able to keep at least 5 songs in reserve for every album Parlophone released \u2013 and the Beatles and the studio couldn\u2019t do anything about it. The result was a nearly doubling of the output of the UK releases and the American market got nearly all of the singles included on the Capitol albums. Note: Both Hard Days Night and Help were vastly different for another reason. In the US we got stuck with the \u201csoundtrack,\u201d which included all of the orchestral music on side 2 (kids didn\u2019t want that crap!). United Artists had a contract to release the albums as soundtracks in the US. In the UK, the albums were released as \u201ccomplementary\u201d to the movies, so to speak, rather than soundtracks. So they contained all Beatles tunes. As a US fan, I grew up with the American releases, not knowing any better until much, much later. I have to confess that I really did enjoy listening to the singles appearing on their respective albums and co-mingling with other songs that were a contemporary match to their creation. With the UK releases, you have to play the \u201cSingles\u201d LP, which lines them up and plays them in order\u2026but out of context. Today, of course, I play the Parlophone LPs, as they are the ones getting the reissue treatment, but I do miss hearing the singles in their native environment. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhy did The Beatles release different albums in the US?\u201d USA\u2019s Capitol Records had a man in charge who thought very little of British music was worthy of being in the American market, so he passed on the first few Beatles albums and singles. Strangely, Capitol was actually OWNED by EMI, the Beatles British label, yet the parent company refused to make their American publishing branch publish the most popular albums in Britain! So they let a small company called VJ Records put out the 1st Beatles album instead. After constantly rejecting requests by both Brian Epstein and George Martin to release Beatles records in the United States, in November 1963 EMI label head Sir Joseph Lockwood sent a deputy to Los Angeles ordering EMI's subsidiary, Capitol Records to commence promoting and releasing Beatles records in the United States. Despite the \"first album\" claim on its cover, ten days prior to its release, Vee-Jay Records of Chicago beat Capitol to the punch with the release of the Beatles' American debut album Introducing... The Beatles, which had been delayed for release for various reasons since the previous summer. The Beatles were signed to perform on the Ed Sullivan Show in the beginning of 1964. Capitol, finally realizing they were missing an opportunity for sales, pushed out a version of the 1st album ahead of schedule, and shortly after in April 1964 , the next album. While the Beatles' first two British albums each contained 14 tracks, in the American market albums were typically limited to 12 tracks and it was expected for albums to include the current hit single. The first three tracks on the album include the December 1963 Capitol single \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" along with the record's B-sides both in the United States, \"I Saw Her Standing There,\" and in the UK with \"This Boy\" from the original November 1963 release. Neither \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" nor \"This Boy\" had appeared on album at the time in the UK, while \"I Saw Her Standing There\" had been the lead-off track to the band's debut album. The other nine tracks on Meet the Beatles! are duplicated from its nearest UK counterpart album With the Beatles. Those were Beatles original songs and not cover versions of songs done by other artists with exception of \"Till There Was You\". The remaining five tracks from With the Beatles were songs originally recorded by other artists. Capitol determined that for their first album they would only include original and fresh material. There was fear that the remakes would turn Americans off of the Beatles. The other five songs would appear on Capitol's next American LP, The Beatles' Second Album, released in April 1964. Capitol kept the pattern of changing songs going for years! In 1966 Capitol released Yesterday and Today, an album that only appeared in the USA, that the company had culled from the albums the band released in Britain. Taking three songs, from the British Revolver, Capitol had finally caught up to all the Beatles music published by EMI. Which made the next step possible\u2026 When the Beatles made Sgt Pepper, they had achieved such dominance in music they were able to finally put their foot down and demand Capitol put out the exact same album at the same time as EMI. After that they were mostly the same, except for Magical Mystery Tour, that was released as a double EP in the United Kingdom with fewer songs and an LP in the United States with recent singles added to fill it out. Many years later the American version for Magical Mystery Tour became the standard for that album as EP\u2019s were not terribly popular as a format for songs. ",
