            "answer_text": "Within VidIq there seems to be a tag volume found in two places: Found when comparing tags: this value signifies the number times the specific tag you are looking at has been search for within a given period (I believe a month)The overall tag volume for a video: This appears as a number out of 5 for a given video\u2019s SEO score. This number reflects the total tag volume of your tags. If you add a bunch of tags with individually high tag volumes then the videos tag volume will be higher as well. If you add tags that are rarely searched then your videos tag volume score will be low.Hope this helps! ",
