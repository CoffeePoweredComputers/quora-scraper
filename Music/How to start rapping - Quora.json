            "answer_text": "Nothing hard, just practice singing in your own voice instead of changing it. Moreover, if you have a high pitched voice naturally, then its gonna be hard. But never lose hope, because rap is nothing but just the way you sing the lyrics fast and keep up with the tune until the end of the song. Above all, don\u2019t forget to warm up your voice before you do. ",
