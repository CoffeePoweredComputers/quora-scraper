            "answer_text": "Grammar and Musical system Every language and artform has a grammar. By grammar I mean the rules and principles to express it. French has a grammar, German has a grammar, Tanjore paintings had a theme and grammar. I think you got the idea. So every art and language and other forms of human expressions had a grammar. To understand and appreciate a human expression like a language or art, one need to understand the grammar and then build semantics (meanings) out of it. Semantics always follows syntax. Calculus appears complex if you fail to understand what algebra or numbers are. The grammar of Indian music (let's consider Carnatic and HIndustani, and not film music for easiness) has lot of concepts which underwent transformations from ancient historical times. There are many western thinkers and musicologists trying to understand it, but the mass crowd has not yet started to do so. Popularity and followers A human expression becomes popular from its nascent stage after it gains followers. \u201cWhy isn't Indian music spread worldwide?\u201d is as good as asking \u201cWhy isn't Tamil, Malayalam or Bengali spread worldwide\u201d. The languages that I mentioned here are just examples - it points out that an idea or language was confined to a set of people. It was nurtured and followed by a group and it was not necessary to spread the language world wide. For communication worldwide \u201cEnglish\u201d and \u201cSpanish\u201d became prominent. This was because of British and Spanish invasion in many countries which engendered the need for those languages. How many Indians can speak Mandarin or say Sinhalese. So an idea is propagated by its followers only if the necessity grows. In this case as English became world wide, the world started listening to english songs and thus western music creeped into Indian minds as well. Techniques and style Indian music and Western music has some disparities :- the number of pitches in an octave, the concept of melodic scales, the concept of micro tones and semi notes etc. A mind tuned to Western mode finds it difficult (I'm not saying its not possible) to tune to another mode of musical form. Indian music has the concept of ornamentation of melodics scales through various structural and positional pitch variations called Gamakams (Sangathis). Since the mass crowd can easily grasp the idea of western notation, western music culture gained popularity easily. On the other hand, the growth of Carnatic and Hindustani music is slower since the art forms require an extra layer of understanding the grammar and how the art form is expressed or delivered. ",
