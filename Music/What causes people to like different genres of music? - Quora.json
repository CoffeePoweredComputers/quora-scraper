            "answer_text": "I think a lot of the reason for a person\u2019s genre preference has to do with what music they grew up hearing. I know many a person my age (67, ) for instance, who introduced their children to the Beatles. A young lady who appeared recently, and did very well, on one of the talent shows started listening to, singing along with, and later performing operatic arias from the age of 2 on. I have a private music student who is enamored with the music of Fish and other such groups because she hears their work on video games, etc. Folks who grow up in certain church denominations often favor gospel. People from southern and western states often favor country music. You get the idea. On the other hand, some people simply like the beat and drive of music that features these elements, like a lot of rock music. Again, I am 67, and every time I hear Elvis Presley\u2019s \u201cJailhouse Rock,\u201d I just want to get up and dance! Same is true of The Beach Boys\u2019 \u201cGood Vibrations.\u201d To fast forward to today, I really enjoy The Jonas Brothers\u2019 recent release \u201cSucker for You.\u201d I love the song \u201cJust Can\u2019t Stop the Beat,\u201d from the musical Hairspray. On the other hand, I , like many people, can also appreciate more mellow songs like Prince\u2019s \u201cPurple Rain.\u201d Powerful ballads, like \u201cBring Him Home,\u201d from Les Miserables or \u201cLily\u2019s Eyes,\u201d from Secret Garden move my heart so much that I cry every time I see these shows. What\u2019s more, I so very much appreciate an aria (song from an opera or oratorio) like \u201cDer Holle Rache,\u201d from Mozart\u2019s opera, The Magic Flute. This type of music inspires the listener because the vocal gymnastics required to perform it correctly are truly astonishing\u2026mind-blowing, actually. I have bought tickets to see this opera just to hear that aria and other singing by the character, The Queen of the Night. I am a person who also very much likes, teaches, and performs choral music. The intertwining of the voice parts and the harmonies created make for an awesome sound! As I also enjoy and teach the folk songs of our country, as well as the patriotic songs that we all learn from the day we were born. If you haven\u2019t discerned this already, I like most genres for different reasons. Two genres that I don\u2019t care much for are heavy metal and rap. I just don\u2019t find them interesting. ",

            "answer_text": "Throughout the course of your life you encounter many things that influence your taste in music. Start with your childhood. What kind of music did your parents and family members listen to? At such a young age you would accept that type of music as \u201cnormal.\u201d If you grew up in Edinburgh \u201cnormal\u201d music would sound very different than if you grew up in Houston. Then comes your teen years. What kind of music did your peers listen to? They\u2019ve probably grown up with music similar to what you\u2019ve grown up with, but the teen years are the time kids begin to separate from their parents so they intentionally find new types of music. This is your second big influence. Then there\u2019s the question of playing a musical instrument. Anyone who has learned to play any type of instrument is going to be influenced by the music associated with that instrument. If you learned to play the electric guitar you were probably exposed to different music than if you learned to play the piccolo. Lastly, there\u2019s still that place in your heart that gravitates to certain types of sounds. If you\u2019re drawn to ballads, you\u2019ll gravitate to songs that are somewhat familiar but are soft and gentle. If you favor a quicker pace, you\u2019ll gravitate to rock, polka, or line dancing. If you love the sound of a violin, you\u2019ll gravitate to chamber music or orchestras. Basically, your taste in music continues to evolve during your life, but there will always be a certain sound or a certain beat that you connect with a bit more than others. ",
