            "answer_text": "The answer to the question is \u201cYes, \u201cImagine\u201d is an example of (i.e. consistent with) transcendentalism. The American transcendentalists, led by Emerson and Thoreau, operated with the sense that a new era was at hand. In \u201cImagine,\u201d Lennon announces a New Dream. \u201dImagine\u201d is his most revered song. It struck a chord in people of all beliefs all over the globe. Strangely, its atheistic message hasn\u2019t stopped it from being played at churches, cathedrals, mosques, temples, chapels and synagogues the world over. The transcendentalists were critics of their own contemporary society for its unthinking conformity. Lennon was a constant critic of society for the same reason. In \u201cImagine\u201d he asks listeners to imagine a world in which the things that divide us no longer exist. Lennon begins by asking us to imagine no heaven and hell. That\u2019s easy. It\u2019s just common sense that heaven and hell are not actual places. Perhaps one could call them states of mind, but actual places, no. Next Lennon asks us to imagine no countries. He doesn\u2019t address the practicality of having no countries or borders because that\u2019s not the point. He just says imagine it. \u201cImagine all the people living life in peace.\u201d Lennon believed that people were inherently good and could live in peace. The idea that people are inherently good is a core belief of Transcendentalism. \u201cImagine no possessions.\u201d Lennon\u2019s been called a hypocrite for saying this and subsequently not giving away all his possessions. Again, I think that\u2019s missing the entire point. The point is that we imagine a world without the things that divide us\u2014like materialism. \u201cYou may say I\u2019m a dreamer. But I\u2019m not the only one. I hope someday you\u2019ll join us, and the world will be as one.\u201d That\u2019s related to another core belief of transcendentalism\u2014that each person is empowered to behold within him or herself a part of the divine\u2014 God if you will. Lennon\u2019s words are also consistent with the Upanishads\u2014You can see all beings in your own self and your self in all beings. One wonders how Lennon\u2019s gentle and idealistic vision of a world without fear, war, greed, hunger or hatred could inspire the venom and wrath contained in one of the answers. Yes, Lennon\u2019s words are utopian and certainly revolutionary. But there is nothing na\u00efve about them and they are certainly not empty. The song \u201cImagine\u201d is one of the most beloved songs in the entire world. Former President Jimmy Carter has said that, \u201cIn Many countries around the world...you hear John Lennon\u2019s song \u201cImagine\u201d used almost equally with national anthems.\u201d Rolling Stone ranks the song as #3 on its list of \u201cThe 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\u201d The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation named it the greatest song of the past 100 years. Lennon was generally an agnostic or atheistic most of his adult life. However, he studied religion\u2014all kinds of religion. He did study the Upanishads and Hindu philosophy. Lennon was smart and well-read. However, he was not a formal philosopher. He summed up his beliefs simply like this: \u201cEveryone has goodness inside. Follow your dream. Live for today. Be true to yourself. Love other people, Help someone if they\u2019re down. Learn to see. Love is all you need.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on how one defines transcendentalism. I would say its lyrical theme is the unfortunate result of the dark side of the Enlightenment. Let me put my cards on the table before I continue; I detest Lennon's 'Imagine'. Not so much the musical arrangement. It features a nice-sounding piano - although it could've done without the Saccharine Spector Strings that corrupted earlier songs like \u2018Across the Universe\u2019, \u2018Let it Be\u2019 and \u2018The Long & Winding Road\u2019. But it's those lyrics I so deeply despise. Fraught as they are with utopianism, Revolutionary naivet\u00e9, hypocrisy, self-loathing .and emptiness masked as godly wisdom.  Is \u2018Imagine\u2019 an example of Transcendentalism?  First we need to establish what this concept entails before the question can be answered. Let us briefly look at its origins and history:  It started as a literary, political and philosophical movement in the early 19th century as a direct result of American Unitarianism, although Transcendentalist Theory proved to be more radical than its religious predecessor. Thoureau\u2019s classic book \u2018Walden\u2019 is a well-known product of this philosophy. Original influences are: The Indian Upanishads, German Idealism, American Romanticism and \u2018Sturm und Drang\u2019- paganism. Philosophically speaking, Transcendentalism was both a rational and intuitive way of thinking, believing in the goodness of both mankind an nature - although it did not fully reject Empiricism unlike the comparable Romanticism. Unlike later Rationalist ideologies, Transcendentalism is individualistic and retained a spiritual component .  So, is \u2018Imagine\u2019 transcendentalist? Let\u2019s review and analyze the lyrics, shall we?   \"Imagine\"   Imagine there's no heaven It's easy if you try No hell below us Above us only sky Imagine all the people Living for today...   Well John, you disgusting hippie, we don\u2019t need to imagine that which has already come to pass in Human History, do we? Let us look at the atheist societies of the 20th century, shall we? Like, for example, the Albanian & North-Korean ones. Societies that did away with religious concepts of 'Heaven & Hell' because they themselves were intended to become Utopian paradises, yet they all ended up as Earthly Hells.  \u201cImagine all the people living for today\u201d. Sure because communism ended history and people should live only for today and forgo long term planning and spirituality altogether, because from now on the State or Party will handle such bothersome details for them.    Imagine there's no countries It isn't hard to do Nothing to kill or die for And no religion too Imagine all the people Living life in peace...   You said it John, for don\u2019t we all know too well that countries and religions turned those Pacifist Primitives, those perpetual peaceniks of primeval days into Civilized Sociopaths and Assailants of minute - yet cute - furry, fluffy critters and may those Reactionary Revisionists and anti-revolutionary liars calling themselves Historians be damned. Enemies of the People, all of them . Let left wing Liverpudlians be your guide. You may say I'm a dreamer But I'm not the only one I hope someday you'll join us And the world will be as one   You dreaming dolts do that: dream your narcissistic dreams in unison. Preferably in some Hippie hidey hole alongside the Ganges under the auspices of some Ego-mining Yogi Hack. Oh? Did that before, you say? Well, imagine this time not being a grotesque retard who is taken for the proverbial ride by a guru who's so clearly a second hand car \u2013 or better karma \u2013 salesman?  It\u2019s easy if you try. Well maybe not so easy if YOU try\u2026  Imagine no possessions I wonder if you can No need for greed or hunger A brotherhood of man Imagine all the people Sharing all the world...  Right, now I\u2019m growing mad. What do you mean \u201cimagine\u201d no possessions? How about you stop imagining illusionary scenarios and start giving away a significant part of Your possessions - preferably to people who need it? Maybe transform your imagination into reality? I\u2019m wondering, not so much if you Can, but rather if you Want to? You can even keep the Rolls Royce, the Steinway and the Mansion.   You may say I'm a dreamer But I'm not the only one I hope someday you'll join us And the world will live as one   O be quit, damn Hippie! So yeah, you can\u2019t call those laughable lyrics Transcendentalism, as they have all the allegorical nuance and mystical depth of a poem written by a dyslexic, Trotskist teenager. Transcendentalist thought is rooted in the ancient Upanishads, in Hindu philosophy, rather unlike Lennon\u2019s Marxist lyrics. Why? Because Marxist doctrine differs greatly on certain key points from Upanishad Philosophy; although some Upanishad texts are dualistic in nature, the chief ones amongst them are Monistic (\u2018Oneness\u2019), whereby Brahman (\u2018Ultimate Hidden Reality\u2019) and Atman (\u2018Inner Self/Soul\u2019) form a Union or are the same even. The Physical Realm hides this truth and is known as Maya (\u2018Illusion\u2019). The path to Truth or Enlightenment is off course an Eternal, Inner Path which must be traversed by the individual. Marxism on the other hand is a completely Materialist, Externalist Philosophy, viewing History itself, not as a path but as a Maelstrom dragging Mankind - locked in continuous class struggle - to the end of History where a classless world awaits. In the Upanishadic tradition, the ontological reality of the World is perfect, it\u2019s Man who needs to evolve and change to bring themselves in Balance with Brahman. A Marxist recognizes no eternal world, no individual development . Mankind is defined by its economic activity and exists only as a collection of social relations. It\u2019s basically the same old, pure rationalism , Enlightenment Hubris. Mankind is basically good and will be able to conquer Nature through the use of Reason. Man need not adapt to the world. No, the world needs to adapt to Man. Is it any wonder Marxism - and its bastard offspring a la Feminism, Neo-progressivism or Cultural Marxism - remains unto this very day a veritable haven for Narcissists? From Lenin to Lennon. Narcissists and hypocrites. This doctrine is wrong on so many levels. From its erroneously predicted classless & stateless world, its contradictory vision of a continuously transforming Nature that will nonetheless result in social stasis. To the supposedly innate goodness of Mankind; in my humble opinion Marxism and its many variants constitute an inhuman evil still haunting this world of ours to this day. So no, \u2018Imagine\u2019 is not a transcendentalist song. It is a Materialist Hymn glorifying the Fluctuating, Temporal World of Maya. Enlightenment as an earthly, collectivist Fever Dream, composed by and for the Self-loving Braggart.  May this musical virtue signaling soon be forgotten.  ",
