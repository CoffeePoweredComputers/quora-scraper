Ditto for \u201cElectric Avenue\u201d and \u201cFlashdance.\u201d But it\u2019s often true that what we call 60s, 70s, 80s, is really a mid-decade switch. We don\u2019t associate songs from 1960\u201362 with \u201cthe Sixties.\u201d Johnny Mathis and Jimmy Rodgers don\u2019t fit in the same category as the Beatles and Motown. ",
