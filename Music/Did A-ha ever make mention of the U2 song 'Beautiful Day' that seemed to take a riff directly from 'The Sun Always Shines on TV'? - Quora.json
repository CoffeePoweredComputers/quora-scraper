A quick search of the web does not reveal if a-ha has ever said anything about it; and I don\u2019t know if U2 pays a portion of royalties to Pal Waktaar, who wrote the a-Ha song. It\u2019s possible that Waktaar just isn\u2019t fussed about it \u2014 basing pop songs on other pop songs is something that is way more common than most people realize. Not everyone sues over these things. ",
