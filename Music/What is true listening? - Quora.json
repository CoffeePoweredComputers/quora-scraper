            "answer_text": "Listening without framing a response. Listening without judgement. Listening to understand. Listening for the subtle clues to what is behind the words. Listening not to diagnose but to assist. In my work as a military chaplain, my opening line with most clients is: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d This leaves the space for the client to tell me whatever they want or don\u2019t want. After that, my most frequent sentence is: \u201cTell me more about that.\u201d What I am trying to do is to understand the situation as the client understands it. They may be clearly mistaken or they may be clearly delusional. That doesn\u2019t matter to me because it is the lived reality of the client. From there, I can find out more about the situation from other points of view and then work to solve problems, including the problem of the client\u2019s lived reality not being objective reality. But I would not even address obvious errors in the client\u2019s reality while the client is speaking and I am listening. That turns listening into an argument, not an exploration of the client\u2019s thoughts, emotions and plans. I can\u2019t tell you how many clients resolve their issues by being heard. In many cases, being heard is all the client needed. ",

            "answer_text": "I should say one listen truly when one pay true attention to the source of the sound/speech, truly trying to comprehend the meaning, and truly trying to get the message fully. But as we forget very fast, particularly when the sound/speech is very long, we can try to get the main points as much as possible. When the sound/speech is short and precise, we should get it perfectly. There are many noises in most spaces. We don\u2019t pay attention to them. But often a prevailing sound can emerge - such as alarm. When we hear it and know what it is, we react accordingly. There is understanding in hearing. When someone is speaking in life, in audio or video, we still try to grasp the meanings. When we understand the seriousness, we would stop doing what we do and stop and listen. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, true listening is when you can put aside all prejudices, all opinions, and look at someone as a human. A mistake-making, happy, sad, human. It\u2019s when you cross your legs, fold your hands in my lap, and say \u201cTell me.\u201d If you want someone to tell you, and feel at ease while doing so, you need to make that clear. Hope this helps! ",
