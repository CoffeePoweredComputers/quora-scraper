            "answer_text": "The Marshall Tucker Band. The band\u2019s original members were Toy Caldwell, Tommy Caldwell, Doug Gray, George McCorkle, Jerry Eubanks, and Paul Riddle \u2014 not a Marshall or Tucker in the bunch. In their early days they rented a warehouse in Spartanburg, South Carolina as a rehearsal space; the key to the warehouse was inscribed with the name Marshall Tucker, so they took that as the band name. As it turned out, Marshall Tucker was the name of the blind piano tuner who had rented the space before they did. Molly Hatchet were another Southern rock band formed in the 1970\u2019s, and no, not a Molly in sight; the band\u2019s name was taken from a Civil War-era Southern legend about a prostitute named Molly who liked to decapitate her clients with an axe.
