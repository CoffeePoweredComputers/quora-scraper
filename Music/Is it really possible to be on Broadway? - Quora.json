Pardon the flippancy but this is the kind of question that aims to either to boost one\u2019s confidence or to squash someone\u2019s dream. However, if this is a sincere inquiry about whether to pursue a career, then this needs a more substantial response. When you mean make it, I assume you mean as a performer. And if you mean as a performer, I must further clarify whether someone who works primarily in musicals or someone who performs in straight (non-musical) plays. Also, do you consider being in the ensemble as \u201cmaking it?\u201d Many people make their performing careers solely in musical theatre ensembles. The days of the \u201cgypsy\u201d is long gone. (Dancers would stay with a show for a few months and then move on to another show, quickly learning the dance steps which, back then, were not very difficult.) There are people who make substantial careers being in the chorus of shows. There is a shelf life to that career. Muscles wear and tear. After a while many dancers move to another career. If you are thinking of a career as an actor on the Broadway stage, you should know that there is just as much work to be had in regional theatres around the country. It is possible to work steadily and have a successful career before appearing on Broadway, which eventually becomes just another venue. It is possible, nowadays to be a working actor with a career in regional theatres. If you are seriously considering this career path, don\u2019t be stupid. STUDY! It\u2019s not enough to have talent or passion. You need technique and craft and you get those only through study. Voice, dance, acting and, yes, a little bit of theatre history so that you have some appropriate context of the work you are cast in. If it\u2019s dancing in musicals, then you should know a little ballet, tap, modern, hip-hop and jazz. You should be able to at least carry a tune and to read music, if you\u2019re a dancer. Acting? Learn Shakespeare for Pete\u2019s sake. Learn voice and movement as well as conveying emotional truths. When I work with professional actors, I am amazed at how much they know about how to get the best out of a single line. And conversely, when I work with amateur actors, I get annoyed with how poor their basic reading skills are. Get a copy of a recent Playbill and check out the cast biographies. Note how many people in the ensemble have at least a B.A. Someone may be called an \u201covernight success\u2019 but that person nowadays has a degree from Julliard, NYU, or some other institution. Study. Will this guarantee that you will \u2018make it\u2019? No. It will help you be prepared when opportunity knocks. ",

            "answer_text": "100s of people do it every night--so yes, of course.  However 10,000s if not 100,000s wish they were up there every night and aren't.  From my understanding (only anecdotal sources to back this up), the talent market for mainstream big Broadway productions is highly saturated. There are a handful of truly outstanding actors and actresses and then many many many very very talented people after them all of whom are qualified for roles on Broadway. For most people on stage at a given show there are likely hundreds of people just as talented who didn't make it. Getting cast ends up being a huge random process.  I have never auditioned for a broadway show nor has it ever been an ambition of mine, but I have close friends who have both as actors and musicians. The people that make it 99 times out of 100 do so with persistence, discipline, patience, luck and through network connections, rather than raw talent or the 'right' look.  That's what I think, but I don't have any hard data to support that viewpoint.  Thanks for the A2A ",
