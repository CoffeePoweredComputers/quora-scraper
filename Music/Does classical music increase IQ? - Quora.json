            "answer_text": "IQ is not necessarily something that can be increased or decreased, although IQ tests may give varying results (revolving around a set baseline, your actual IQ) due to your mood the day you took the test, and other extraneous factors. However, it is possible (and I am no expert on the situation) that enjoying classical music is a sign of a higher than normal IQ. While this theory isn\u2019t universal, there are those of average or lower IQ who enjoy classical music, it would then lead to a different question: what kind of music do lower-than-average-IQ people enjoy?
