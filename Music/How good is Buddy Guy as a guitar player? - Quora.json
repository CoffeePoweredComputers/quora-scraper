            "answer_text": "Now, get this straight, we\u2019re talking about a career blues guitarist, not a metal, Rock n Roll, Jazz or prog rock guitarist\u2026 However, what is interesting to note, everyone of these other guitar genres owes much to Buddy Guy and his sense of melody and his ability to make the guitar channel emotions to the audience. He invented using the guitar as an extension of his soul as opposed to just using it as means to support the singing voice\u2026In other words, he was instrumental in developing the extended guitar solo\u2026This influenced Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page and scores of other famed guitarists to break the 3 minute song barrier and include lead solos within their recording tracks. Buddy Guy was the master of the minor Pentatonic blues scale and to the learned guitarist, an inventor of creative ways to approach using bends, hammer ons and pull offs, especially when maneuvering the offset jump between the G string and the B string. When you listen to any of his countless live shows, his leads will sound very familiar, because they are the primer for countless other solos of note by many, many other recording guitarists. Buddy Guy is of legendary status. He achieved this by an entire lifetime of blues guitar performing, writing and recording. He is heralded as the single most copied blues lick player, which is quite an accolade when you consider Chuck Berry, Muddy Waters, Bo Diddly, and Robert Johnson are in the same category, but not at the very top. What Buddy did that was different is that he embraced the electric guitar and it\u2019s tonal boundaries. Mainly playing a Fender Strat, Iconoclast by the signature black and white polka dot paint job. All that you have to do is listen to his songs live to find out why so many revere him as a great guitarist. ",

            "answer_text": "From a technical standpoint, he may be good, he may not be. From a listening standpoint, he is boring and repetitive, plain bad. Blues is a very varied genre, with the good stuff being as good as it gets, and the bad stuff being repetitive, derivative, and everything sounds the same. Buddy Guy falls into the second bucket. Music is boring, same guitar licks and notes over and over, same boring drawn out notes. I describe most blues bands as sounding like group of folks that at one time decided they would be a blues band, who then spend the rest of their careers trying to sound like a blues band, and end up with the same boring, repetitive, derivative, unimaginative, terrible sound that everybody else does. Buddy may have been one of the early guys, and at the time he.may have been original and considered good. But he just isn't. The day someone plays a Buddy Guy song that doesn't sound like all of the rest of his songs and like all of the rest of the 'classic blues guitarists', it will be the first time in history. ",
