            "answer_text": "You should find out from your parents why they are unwilling or unable to allow you to take voice lessons. It might be that they can\u2019t afford them\u2014mine cost $120/month, and the only reason I\u2019m able to pay for them is because I got a raise at work. It might be Covid. Singing is a good way to spread the virus because you are forcing air out of your lungs for extended breaths, rather than for short breaths as you do when speaking. Maybe transportation is a problem. They might be unable to transport you to or from the lessons. Are you already in choir, and they don\u2019t want to have to take you to and from two extracurricular things? Are your grades satisfactory? That would be another reason for them to possibly turn you down. Luckily for you, there is Youtube\u2014but be careful. Consult with the choir director at your school or with a voice teacher you trust, and ask that person which Youtube voice instructors you should learn from. This way, you can at least start learning vocal exercises. Youtube is not ideal. Ideal is having a voice teacher who can touch your abdomen and tell you if you\u2019re supporting your breath correctly. I learned more in one lesson from a teacher who asked permission to touch my abdomen and gave me feedback than I did from five years of studying with a teacher who didn\u2019t touch me. It may be that your parents want to see some dedication from you to this goal, rather than shelling out money for you to take lessons for what they might consider a lark. I have no idea. Your best bet is to get an understanding of what your parents\u2019 objection is to voice lessons, and work from there. Good luck! ",
