            "answer_text": "There are many reasons. I don't know them all, but I will share those I do know. I assume you mean any lower valued job when you say \u201cminimum wage job\u201d and there is a difference. I worked at McDonald's for nearly 20 years, so I can speak from that angle. Number one, if you make it past 6 months, there is no way (at a corporate store) that you are making minimum wage. (Caveat that your boss does his actual job.) McDonald's policy states that there is a review every six months and even if it isn't a glowing review, there is still a tiny raise. Yes, TINY. So after time, you really aren't earning minimum wage anymore, but even after 20 years, it isn't a huge amount. Also, at my store, towards the end of my career, they weren't hiring at minimum wage anyway. Don't know if that was McDonald's wide or just my area/store. I stayed for many reasons, and I don't know if many of them outweighed another until my last 2 years. First, it was convenient for my schedule. Working at McDonald's put me through college. Yup, I paid 90% of my college bills working at McDonald's. I was lucky to be able to live with my parents, and they did contribute to my education, but the part I paid for, I could do. Also, I could work as I pleased and not work when I pleased. It is extremely flexible with a little planning, and if you are reliable and actually do your job when there, practically permanent as long as you want it to be. Second, I liked my co workers. I valued them as friends and I still see a couple on a regular basis, more so that friends from other places. Sure, there were those who I wouldn't give CPR to, but I've had those at every job I've ever worked. But, many of my coworkers, gave my life experiences that taught me about life and stuck through those hard shifts. Third, it was comfortable. I knew what I was doing versus a new job that I didn't know. I didn't have a reason to leave until after college and then my last 2 years. Fourth, when I graduated, there were not many openings in my area of education. The few there were didn't hire me and I had the third listed reason to boot, so I just started subbing and worked both jobs. It worked for me, but grandfather always wondered when I'd get a real job. Fifth, after a \u201cfew initial mishaps\u201d let's say, I finally qualified for health insurance. And McDonald's offers it's managers GOOD health insurance. This is the reason I stayed my last 2 years. Had I not had it, I would have left way earlier- by the time I left, I was working 5 jobs. 4 of which were in my degree area. All part time. I had also bought my own home and was about to buy my second car. All working part time at \u201ca minimum wage job.\u201d Things I've noticed about my coworkers during those years include: They don't think they can do anything else. (low self esteem) They live in fear of trying.They made some bad financial choices so they don't have room to take a risk on a new job.They don't have many job skills so they bounce around from store to store, quitting before they get fired and can't be hired. Or getting fired, because they refuse to ask for help or work on things like showing up, being on time, being nice to customers, etc.Never occurred to them to try and do something else.Those 4, don't apply to everyone, but some might overlap. As for the part of your questions about pay, they want to be valued too. They are being told that they are being undervalued where they are. Who doesn't want to make more money?? If we worked jobs at $100 or $1000 an hour, and we were told long enough that we were being paid less than we were worth, wouldn't we want more? Some people realize their worth and do move past the \u201cminimum wage job,\u201d others think that the world must come to them, coupled with the 4 reasons I listed above. In the end, I think it boils down to how they were raised. ",

            "answer_text": "Very few minimum wage jobs allow a person to develop skills to progress to higher paying jobs. Thinking they do is thinking we still have a labor intensive manufacturing economy. Thinking these are jobs are meant for kids is an indication you don't know what these jobs are. Many of these low wage jobs are working in nursing homes and hospitals helping move patients and cleaning up after them. Many are cleaning offices and bathrooms after the close of business. Many are performing hard labor while kids are in school. Many of these jobs involve pulling the guts out of chickens for processing. Many of those low wage retail and food jobs are at 24 hour places conflicting with school or are the graveyard shift. As for how much they should or should not make, that is a philosophical question. It really depends on whether you believe a business that cannot offer a living wage should be saved by the government subsidizing the employee\u2019s survival. Of course many companies providing wages below the poverty rate are not just profitable, they are highly profitable. McDonalds with no price increases would remain profitable at $15 an hour though it would take about half their profits. In the lower margin world of retail it would take 80% of Walmart\u2019s profits if there were no price increases. Both companies are holding substantial cash to pay in dividends but also to artificially prop up stock prices by buying their stock back. So it really is a question of who pays these people enough to have food, utilities, and housing? The government or their employers? Now the national debate ignores that costs differ. If you make the Arkansas minimum wage $8.50 that the equivalent of making $15 an hour in San Francisco. I know a lot of people in Arkansas who were proud to vote for the state wage increase who think those people in San Francisco are crazy for supporting $15 an hour even though it provides a similar standard of living.
