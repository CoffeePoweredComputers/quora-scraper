            "answer_text": "Well the answer is to be found in the brain. Through evolution, we have evolved to have a mechanism to control our mental and physical health. When your body lacks nutriton, in order for you to keep your phsycal health, you naturally feel hunger, as feeling no hunger wouldn\u2019t make you eat and thus you\u2019d be in disbalance. When your leg hurts, it\u2019s beneficial because if it was not for your pain, you\u2019d keep moving and thus the leg would be in a worse condition. When you feel pain being alone, it\u2019s because your brain wants you to act accordingly, find a friend or partner, which would improve your mental health. So pain is beneficial, whether in phsycal or mental form. Unless\u2026 There\u2019s momments when pain is overwhelming; then pain is counter-productive, it can only do bad. In those situations your brain make you cry, as crying improves your mood by hormonal changes that happen in the process. As social beings, it\u2019s crucial for us to express ourselves to other members of the social group. We have evolved so as we are still tribal beings \u2014 the human race has spent way more time in tribes than in civilization. So if a tribe member feels weak due to having pneumonia, it\u2019s crucial that he seek acknowledge from other members of the group, to be priviliged for the time he\u2019s recovering. If not priviliged, he may die walking / running long distances daily, which was the norm back then. Other members of the tribe also need to have empathy to feel his pain. When you express pain properly, or feel compassionate with others, your brain rewards you because you are doing the right thing for the survival of the tribe. The brain releases hormons which make you feel cathartic and relieved. That\u2019s what happens when you listen to sad songs. Also, singing makes us more prone to expressing emotion than the case is with speaking. The result: you crying tears all over listening to a sad song. And feeling good about it. ",

            "answer_text": "The ISO (Incremental Sound Organizer) principle of music therapy is designed to deal with changing a person\u2019s emotions as they listen to a medley of music. The mood of the person is measured using a series of scales reflecting a continuum of sadness to happiness and the music is designed to matches the mood of the patient to the music being played and/or listened to, which in turn fosters the achievement of an altered state of consciousness (Honeycutt, Keaton, Hatcher, & Hample, 2014). For example, if you are angry, start with music that is loud gradually switch to a more tranquil piece of music. \u201cThe vectoring power of music is that we change the mood or emotion of persons from one affective pole (joy) to its opposite (anger) through small incremental changes in the rhythm and intensity of the music\u201d (Honeycutt, 2003; p. 82). See this book and chapter 5, \u201cUsing Music Therapy and Imagined Interactions to Cope with Stress\u201d Promoting Mental Health Through Imagery and Imagined Interactions The theory of musical equilibration explains the emotional impact of music as a process in which the listener identifies with the content of the will encoded in the music (Willimek & Wilimek, 2014). For example, if a person is somber; music in the minor keys of F or G minor can reinforce melancholy feelings while music in the majors keys sounds more exhilarating (e.g., D and G majors; Also see The Evolution of the Iso Principle in Music Therapy and Music Listening | ",
