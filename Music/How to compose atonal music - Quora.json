            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a very large question because atonal covers so much territory\u2014anything without a clear tonal center, to start, although in working practice it tends also to entail a purposeful avoidance of historically grounded consonant-dissonant relationships altogether. In the Second Viennese school, Webern and Berg give two contrasting examples of how atonality can be used. Speaking broadly, Webern\u2019s approach is to crystallize the focus on other aspects of the music, like texture or timbre, and in this he is pretty much unparalleled; Berg seems to have settled on a method in which atonality is but one wrench among the set of possible wrenches instead of an entire worldview unto itself, and he was a master at finding ways to integrate serialism with traditional procedures and structures. There is the hyper-serialism of Boulez, or the data-driven experiments of Xenakis. And then on the other end of the spectrum you have the \u201csonorous atonality\u201d of a composer like the little-known Ernest Stires, who used the sonics and the language of the swing era to create music that grooves and dances while merely flirting with stability\u2014a little like Benny Goodman on a weak hit of acid.  I would say that the primary driver of atonality in music ought to be a sense of genuine necessity. It is clear that tonality is not \u201cdead\u201d and was never even on life support, so we must deal with that first of all. Then, if the composer can establish the necessity for himself and can believe in it, there\u2019s a good chance he can sell it. If not\u2014if it\u2019s just a kind of wanton heterodoxy\u2014then the results probably will come off sounding like 70% of every academic new music festival I\u2019ve been to. Ugh, thanks anyway. ",

            "answer_text": "If what you ask is advice on how to start, I would say that I do not think that atonality is actually a style. Imho it is a very broad spectrum of music, so I don\u2019t think there is one way to do it. You can write using serial systems. You can write using random or chaotic systems. You can write using your ear, as long as you know exactly what you want, which I think is a most rewarding experience. In each and every case you aim at a music that will at the very least obscure tonal centers as much as possible. You can have all kinds of emotion with atonal music just like with tonal, if you use your ear. There are quite a few very nice books to get you started on the subject. However, I would advise listening to a great number of pieces to familiarize yourself with the various sounds that you can get, at least in the same time as the reading. I have recently come to the conclusion that atonality is more a procedure and a certain array of sounds rather than a genre per se. If what you ask is how I specifically do the job myself, I would still say there is no one particular method for me, and I use the same methods for all music, not only atonal. Sometimes I use maths and some pieces of software as a lab of sorts, as a tool to find new aural possibilities. However it is always the ear for me. But this is just me. To each one\u2019s own. ",
