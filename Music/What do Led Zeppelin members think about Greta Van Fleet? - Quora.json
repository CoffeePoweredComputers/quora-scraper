            "answer_text": "Robert has stated that he likes the band, even going as far as saying that Josh Kizska has a \u201cjob waiting\u201d for himself if he wants it. That\u2019s pretty high props. As far as Jimmy and John go, neither have said anything, but I am sure they will make their opinions known soon. In the mean time, I could give some kind of idea of what I think their reaction would be. Jimmy will probably give the band credit and like them, and I would have to believe that John would too. The reason I say probably with Jimmy is that nothing is ever certain with that man. But we\u2019ll see I guess, I won\u2019t be surprised when both say they enjoy their music. The only \u201cmember\u201d of Led Zeppelin (if you want to give him that title) who doesn\u2019t like GVF is Jason Bonham. But, I hardly consider him a member. Now as far as John Bonham is concerned, I also have the belief that he would like them too. ",
