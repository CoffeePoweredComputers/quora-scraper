And the sign said, \"Everybody welcome. Come in, kneel down and pray\"But when they passed around the plate at the end of it allI didn't have a penny to paySo I got me a pen and a paper and I made up my own little signI said, \"Thank you, Lord, for thinkin' 'bout me.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure who actually sang the song first because different websites say different things. On 45cat, it says that Bobby Vee released his version in February 1971. On danhornback, it says that he released it in June of the same year. On Wikipedia, it says that the Five Man Electrical Band released their version in May 1971. On SecondHandSongs, it says they released it in November 1970. I\u2019m not sure when the Five Man Electrical Band originally released their version though. There is a video on YouTube of Bobby Vee\u2019s version. The B-side of the single is Something To Say. I couldn\u2019t find that song though. Here are some links to the websites that I mentioned. 1.) Bobby Vee History BOBBY VEE History 2.) Bobby Vee Discography Bobby Vee discography - Wikipedia 3.) Bobby Vee - Signs/Something To Say single http://www.45cat.com/record/sua50755 4.) The Five Man Electrical Band - Signs Signs (Five Man Electrical Band song) - Wikipedia 5.) SecondHandSongs Signs by Five Man Electrical Band 6.) Bobby Vee\u2019s version of Signs  ",
