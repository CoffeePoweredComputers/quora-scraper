            "answer_text": "I think so. My suspicions were confirmed several years ago when there was a series on TV tracing the evolution of Heavy Metal; Rammstein were towards the end - obviously as a recent addition to the genre. If that\u2019s not correct, I\u2019d be interested to know what category they fall under. Within reason - unless they proudly specialise thusly - most self-respecting bands don\u2019t take too kindly to being pigeonholed into 1 category. Quite a number of years ago Jethro Tull won an award in the Heavy Metal category (?); surprised everyone, including the band themselves! Green Day are always put into the Punk category, but early in their career the singer proclaimed that was not the case. Every time Led Zeppelin are asked/commented on about their involvement in Heavy Metal (were contacted along with Black Sabbath re the Metal evolution documentary - refused on the grounds they didn\u2019t want to associate themselves with H.M.), they just deny any responsibility; I mean, no one would seriously consider \u201cStairway To Heaven\u201d to be a H.M. song (even when H.M. bands attempt to tackle mid-level hard Rock L.Z. songs, the results are nowhere near as potent - though 1 or 2 bands come close). In the middle of the Punk era AC/DC first toured England - and were branded a Punk band! I know some may consider this a long answer to a simple question, but I believe \u2018too much information\u2019 is more beneficial than not enough. ",

            "answer_text": "Rammstein is an industrial metal band. Whether industrial metal is metal or not depends on many things. If a metal genre has more relation to punk/hard rock than metal then it\u2019s not always metal. Though some of them are often considered as metal. For example - Nu Metal, Alternative metal sounded more likely punk than metal to me.Industrial metal riffs sound most likely hard rock riff to me than metal. Little bit harder than hard rock but softer than average metal riffs. That\u2019s why I consider them as a industrial hard rock band.But if you\u2019re talking about metal archive, no, I don\u2019t follow them. A lot of bands on that site aren\u2019t metal. Like Rush, Def Leppard, Skid Row etc. While bands like A7X, tool always sounded metal to me aren\u2019t on that site. ",
