            "answer_text": "When we sing in chest tone (or full voice), the air comes up through the windpipe, through the vocal cords (to create the pitch) and is angled toward the hard palate on the roof of the mouth, and reflected through the open mouth. To sing in falsetto (head range or head/top voice), the air comes up through the windpipe, through the vocal cords (to create the pitch) and is expelled straight up, through the soft palate (the roof of the mouth, above the throat), where it resonates in the nasal cavities and the bones of the skull, creating a different quality of sound. The angle of the air, from hard palate to soft palate, must be combined with a change of air pressure to create the desired effect. To understand this better, slide through your range, from the lowest sound you can sing to the highest, on the vowel \u2018ah\u2019. At one point, the muscles at the top of your throat will shift, to angle the air from forward (hard palate) to straight upward (soft palate). When the shift happens, the voice will make a noticeable break as you slide up through your range. This break point (click point, range break) signals a shift in air pressure: more pressure as you go up, less pressure as you go down. If you keep the pressure steady over the break point, the crack in your voice will be more audible. So, let\u2019s reverse the experiment, and slide from the highest sound you can reach to the lowest, still using the vowel \u2018ah\u2019. The break point will appear at about the same pitch sliding down as it did when sliding up. And again, if you keep the air pressure steady, the break will be even more pronounced; you may even skip a couple half-steps on the way down. I suggested the vowel \u2019ah\u2019 because the shape of the opening at the top of the throat is a wide oval, allowing the most air into the mouth. If you try the slide again, with vowels \u2018oooh\u2019 or \u2018eee\u2019, the break between registers is a little easier to control. I felt it\u2019s better for you to clearly see the challenge you face, and the practice necessary, to control your falsetto. ",

            "answer_text": "Passing in and out of falsetto is hard. Improving the vocal quality, and widening the effective singing range of your falsetto notes is even harder. You need some formal singing training for this.  DIAPHRAGM SUPPORT Most importantly, you need strong diaphragm support. If you don\u2019t know your diaphragm, I\u2019ve included a description below. Developing your diaphragm muscles is one of the most valuable things to cover in one-on-one singing lessons with a properly qualified voice teacher. Tell them that you want to develop your diaphragm for including some falsetto in your singing.  WARM UP AND SIREN EXERCISE Secondly, you need good warm up. Initial warm up at low volume and low pitch is ideal. In my experience, the best vocal exercise for \u201cchanging gears\u201d from chest voice to head voice (falsetto), and back again, is the siren. Do this exercise every time you sing, and focus on making the siren as smooth as possible through your \u201cchanging gears\u201d.  PRACTISE Thirdly, practise. It takes great control to effectively utilise falsetto. Don\u2019t expect it to come easy. Once you have the above two basics learned well, look for songs and opportunities that allow you to practise going up and down through your \u201cgear change\u201d.  LEARNING ABOUT YOUR DIAPHRAGM Working your diaphragm doesn\u2019t relate so much to breathing, it relates to vocal projection and control. You tighten your diaphragm muscles to create more air pressure inside you. Greater air pressure means more energy which you transform into sound through your throat. Stronger diaphragm muscles means both more energy and more control. More energy gives you more to work with for volume, tone, technique, intensity, etc. Tight diaphragm, relaxed throat, is a good general goal. Coughing tightens your diaphragm. Dig your fingers into your belly button and cough, then move your fingers horizontally to another place on your torso, dig them in and cough again. The muscles you feel tighten under your fingers is your diaphragm, and that is the muscle you want to exercise to develop strength and vocal control. When you sing (or speak) you should loosen the diaphragm on the inward breath, and have the diaphragm tight when you make a sound. Always, always, always have a loose, relaxed throat. If you\u2019re tensing your throat, you\u2019re pushing too far, too loud, or too high. ",
