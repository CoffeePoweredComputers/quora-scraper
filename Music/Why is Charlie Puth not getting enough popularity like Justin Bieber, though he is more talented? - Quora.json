            "answer_text": "Due to lack of publicity and promotions, also due to employment of poor publicist can leave an artist with limited limelight. As his fans know, Charlie Puth is self sufficient, evident from his social media posts which are mostly unfiltered. His habit goes to an extent that he has been recording his albums at home. He's just two years old in mainstream music industry. Apart from that, fans start losing interest in an artist when there's is a long gap between albums. Puth released Nine Track Mind in January 2016, and since then, he has been out of spotlight until he released Attention this year. When fans dont get new stuff, they can only chew the old one for so long. Slowly the interest dies. The hype only sustains if there is something worth tapping into. When singers alleged link ups and bar brawls surface, they keep themselves under constant media & thus public's scrutiny. As it's been a well knows fact, everything's fair when it comes to creating public image. The artists utilizes every option to keep that coming. So yeah, some artist are underrated, and good music can't always make them popular, its what they can do apart from that to get maximum crowd. Justin Bieber hasn't been always so positively received by crowd. In his starting years, he was heavily criticized from his looks to his voice. Agree or not, it was the plus point for him either way. Girls like him and gradually, he improved his image. What he is now, is a result of years of hard work and persistence, no matter what people said. Everyone gets what they plan on from day one. It's their daily choice that shapes them. If Charlie Puth wishes, he can be linked in scandals, but he chose to keep his personal life private. Fans always tend to dig that, but when the artist doesn't open up about that, fans divert their attention on their music. It's a long road of patience, and with consistency, he will be someday on top, a long way ahead of what he is today. In my views, this is the appropriate way. Good Luck Charlie. ",

But he came to limelight only in 2014 when he was like in his early 20s. but Justin bieber became really popular when he released a youtube video of his song \u2018baby\u2019 in 2008. Even though Charlie puth is an awesome and great singer he still needs a lot of popularity. His latest hits started in 2015 and it has been only 2 years since then. I surely know that he\u2019ll gain his popularity in the upcoming year or two since he\u2019s making super hit songs like \u2018we don\u2019t talk anymore\u2019 and \u2018attention\u2019.
