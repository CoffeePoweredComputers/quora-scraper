            "answer_text": "Mostly luck. And that popularity begets more and more and more popularity. No, it\u2019s not really \u2018raw talent\u2019 obliterating obstacles (and other singers) as appealing as that romantic notion sounds. I will name a few singers gender wise who are actually pretty well known WITHIN their genre cult but whom you may not recognise by name if you only listen to chart topping pop. Male: Devin Townsend, Daniel Gildenlow, Joe Lynn Turner, Russell Allen, Jeff Buckley Female: Courtney Swain, Floor Jansen, Mary Fahl, Diamanda Galas You may protest that such singers end up not being super-popular because they don\u2019t operate in accessible genres of music. And this is true especially for somebody like Diamanda Galas. However, what if I told you that Floor Jansen actually made an epic cover of Shallow (yeah, the Lady Gaga song)?  This performance had online voice coaches raving for days on end. But IF you weren\u2019t following any of them (and why would you if you weren\u2019t already interested in singing?), you wouldn\u2019t know about this. And that\u2019s how it works in the music industry. It is difficult for singers outside the Billboard top 30 to break through to a large audience because there is no mass medium that will carry them to such an audience. They likely won\u2019t play any of Floor\u2019s epic performances at Beste Zangers on VH1 nor will they bomb radio channels with her cover of Shallow. Not happening. It will stay within a, um, million-something cult. So a pretty large cult but you look at the video of the Oscars performance of Shallow and it\u2019s got two digits on the Beste Zangers zone. There\u2019s nothing Floor could possibly do to reach THAT audience unless Oscars went left field for some strange reason. So, yes, it\u2019s luck or \u201cright place at the right time\u201d stuff that separates famous singers from other good singers. ",

Or as Anna Russell put it, \u201cSo, to be reasonably certain of success in this field, you need to be a glorious voiced, independently wealthy, sexy, politically motivated backstabbing bitch! Of course, it also depends on just what kind of of singing you're talking about. Do you mean pop singers? They don't necessarily need dead on pitch because any irregularities can be autotuned out. Do you mean opera? That requires physical fitness, an ability for languages, a good memory, and a good sense for the dramatic. And the ability to be a diva where necessary, usually for self-defense. And possibly certain physical attributes that allow for greater projection. Do you mean singer-songwriters? That requires good communication skills on top of the rest. With all due respect to Claire Blanchette, I've spent a fair amount of time in and around music schools, and while she raises a bunch of good points, I know any number of good singers who have all those qualities but who are still not famous.
