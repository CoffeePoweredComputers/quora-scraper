            "answer_text": "So much goes into the coverage for your wedding day. Each wedding is unique in size and scope and each geographic area requires a different amount of expenses for that photographer. A town hall elopement, with just your parents and siblings, will be priced differently than a three day affair with 500 guests at an island destination. Legitimate professional photographers have one of the highest overheads: constant maintenance and cleaning of camera, lens and lighting equipment, which needs to be updated every 3 years or so. Computers with high speed processors, tons of RAM, many 4 TB external hard drives to back up the images in multiple places, at least 50 flash cards. Then there are the monthly subscription services for: Photoshop, Bridge, InDesign, Email marketing, Freshbooks, Quickbooks, web server, listing fees on Style Me Pretty ($100/month), The Knot ($250/month), Wedding Wire, etc\u2026yes all of the places where you find your photographers charge a hefty listing fee. Then we have to insure all of our equipment and the venues, churches and synagogues that we work at all require us to to have liability insurance of up to $1 million, $2 million in NYC, in our riders. If we are listed on a venue\u2019s referral list we are required to pay that venue 10% of our contracted fee. So you can see, just the business side of it to get out the door is very expensive. And, at least 25% of whatever we make goes to Federal and State taxes. A great second shooter runs typically $60-$100 hour for the day and a lighting assistant $50/hour. Most weddings in NYC have about 200 guests and 4 locations. So, the expense is much larger for this type of situation (rather than a suburban wedding), as we will need to have a photographer stationed at each location, because we don\u2019t know what type of delays will occur at one location, while the bride and groom, may arrive to the 2nd, 3rd or 4th location before the original photographer does. Also, myself and my photographers all work with backup equipment. Once I had 6 pieces of equipment fail at one wedding! No matter though, I arrive to every wedding with duplicate equipment. It\u2019s a wedding and you CAN\u2019T miss a moment! Experience also plays a huge factor. I know that I won\u2019t miss a moment (unless a guest jumps in front of me with their iPhone), because I know where to place myself to find those moments and capture them with crisp lighting. If it rains, if the ceremony is lit with one candle and running one hour behind, if the groomsmen are drunk, if there are a huge variety of characters within the family, I can navigate the situation. My study of the human form enables me to pose my subjects in the most flattering way and I can give direction to my couples to elicit their natural magic so that they are not posing, but showing their true selves in the photos. A great wedding photographer will have a keen understanding of the dynamics and subtleties of the wedding day and will have prepared for the day for the full year by meeting with the couple to get to know their personalities, understanding the vision and aesthetic cues of the wedding and ensuring that the images reflect them as a couple, and all of the relationships and connections present, this takes time and cultivation. A typical NYC wedding with 10 hours and 200 guests can run anywhere from $4,000-$20,000 depending upon the experience of the photographer. It\u2019s kind of like a car, you can get a Toyota, or a Ferrari, you get what you pay for. Most wedding photographers love their job. I certainly do, my goal for all of my couples is that their children look back on their grandparent\u2019s wedding day and feel all of the love that they were born in to. It\u2019s a huge responsibility. ",

            "answer_text": "It all depends on their packages and what you are look for. Since photographers and videographers work together quite closely, you probably want to hire these professionals at about the same time. And because the photographer you choose is going to capture your day minute by minute, you will want to feel comfortable with this person. You may ask your photographer, (whom you should hire first) for a referral. Here are the questions to ask before you do anything. Questions for the Photographer 1. What\u2019s the photographer\u2019s primary style - traditional posed shots and portraits or photojournalism? (Ask to see their work to know the real answer to this question) 2. What\u2019s his or her philosophy about shooting weddings? (This will give you an idea of the person\u2019s expertise and passion for his or her work, too.) 3. Does the photographer shoot in color, black & white or both? 4. Will the photographer you talk to be the one taking the pictures at your wedding? (This is crucial! Each photographer\u2019s style is his or her own. This question applies to the videographer, also) 5. Is his or her open to a list of must-have photos (the people whom you definitely want shots of.) 6. Does the photographer develop his or her own film? How long does he or she keep the negatives? Can you buy your negatives from the photographer 7. Has the photographer done many weddings? (A photographer who doesn't specialize in weddings is a risk. You want someone who is experienced with how a wedding works so that key moments are not missed!) Questions for the Videographer What\u2019s the videographer\u2019s style- artsy, documentary, or direct (doing interviews with guests)? Does this vibe with what you want. 2. Has the videographer done many weddings; how many? What\u2019s his or her approach when it comes to taping a wedding? (This clues you into experience and philosophy. You want someone who\u2019s experienced with how a wedding works so that key moments are not missed.) 3. How many other weddings is the videographer doing on your wedding day or weekend? (Make sure there are no time constraints. This question applies to the photographer, too) 4. How obtrusive are the shooting style and the crew? How bright are the lights they use? (If shooting requires the room lights to be on all evening, much of the romance will be lost) 5. What kind, how many, and how new are the cameras, tapes, and microphones the videographer uses? (Can you get a DVD instead of a video?) 6. Has the videographer worked with your photographer before? How does he or she coordinate with a wedding photographer? (This is really important) Remember, always ask about pricing and packages; get a current price list to help you make a decision. ",

            "answer_text": "I know it is not what you want to hear, as it is not what I wanted to hear when I first started as a photographer. But photography like many other craft/jobs in the arts is not something you can stick a salary to. First there are a ton of different factors that add up not only to your bottom line but also how much you should charge your clients.  First, it depends where you live. Simple supply and demand will not only dictate your competition but also your rates. As such, it does not matter how good you are, if you are in a market that cannot afford your prices then you will starve, unless you lower your prices and thus make less money. Also, that is not a necessarily a bad thing since your money can travel further in a small city than it would in say, New York.  Second, how much can you provide your clients in terms of quality? There are both an educated and a hardware value. Yes, being creative and having a great eye is a salable asset but the hardware you bring to a job also will dictate how much you should/can charge per weddings/jobs. My photographer friend who shoots mostly weddings, easily walks into a job with $15,000 worth of equipment (2 full frames, with 24-70mm and 70-200mm, plus other lenses and primes, multiple flash guns, backgrounds, even a small electric generator to power his own light sets in case it rains, etc)  ...Anyway, compare my friend to a small-fry wedding photographer and he will beat him under the table in terms of flexibility and reliable quality. Period.  As such, he could ask for $3000+ a wedding while the other guy could only ask $1000 at best depending on expectations. However, with a higher paycheck also comes a higher bottom line, after all, my friend has to pay for all that hardware, plus insurance, plus hardware upgrades, plus earn enough to eat and pay for extra staff if he needs to.  As Laurence mentioned, some photographers may work for a larger studio but generally they get paid less than if they worked on their own. Of course, for many it is a safer bet to shoot some pictures with little overhead and pick a small paycheck than going for larger jobs but having to do and purchase everything on their own.  I do not know where you live, but if you want to get a better idea, then reach out to photographers in your area and well, ask them. I am sure more than a few will not mind giving some advise if you ask politely and respectfully. ",

            "answer_text": "The term \u201cexpensive\u201d is relative. I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m too expensive when I was charging $750 for a wedding, $1,800 and $4,500. It all comes down to what you place your value in. I\u2019ve had potential wedding clients who were both six-figure earners and came from wealthy families that scoffed at my $2,800 starting price. While I\u2019ve also had couples who work low-paying jobs and I know struggled to come up with a deposit and took sides jobs and cut back to pay the rest of their $5,600 wedding photography collection. So while I think it\u2019s crazy someone would pay $500 for a pair of jeans, $2,000 on a set of kitchen knives, $600 for a hair appointment, or $5,000 on a television, that is what those people put value on. Now to answer in a more straightforward way, a lot of the commenters already touched on the pricing of wedding photography: Cost of Doing BusinessBillable hours (25 weddings per year at an average of 48 hours per wedding)Hard costs (albums, prints, cards, etc.)If you find someone who is charging a fairly low wage, more often or not it\u2019s a side job. They have other income to cover their living expenses. For most full-time wedding photographers, we\u2019re in charge of our own income, taxes, insurance and retirement. ",

            "answer_text": "First, it totally depends on the quality of your photographer, the contents of your Photography Collection, and also the City where your wedding takes place. On the latter point, it goes without saying that a wedding photographer in New York City or LA would be more expensive than in some small town on the outskirts of, say, Atlanta. Sure, you can look at widely available statistics, such as the average wedding cost of about $25k-$30k in the U.S. Then you can extrapolate how much of that wedding budget goes to photography. Depending on the source, many folks recommend anywhere between 6\u201315%. Where in that range your allocation falls depends on how important photos are to you. Note that many of these sources also lump video services into the photography budget. Also, some of the total wedding budget figures do not include additional photography services (different from your wedding weekend), such as boudoir, engagement, honeymoon, additional albums, travel, second or third photographer, drone/aerial photos, etc. Percentage calculations are a touch misleading for more expensive weddings, where just the floral design might cost $200,000. Or if you have a wedding with, say, 800 guests who would drive up the catering costs. There are photographers who will capture your wedding for $500 and some who will charge you $60,000+. Ultimately, you get a bit of what you pay for as long as you do some research, interview your potential photographers, and invest confidently in their services (do NOT fall in love with a single image, a stylized portfolio, model shoot, etc. since it is not a reflection of what you should expect for your own wedding). Be forthcoming in the information you provide to your photographers and they will be more inclined to want to work with you and provide additional value in your collection. A wedding photography collection is a fancy term for the photography package you commission. At a minimum, you need one principal photographer for your ceremony and a good portion of your reception. However, most brides will book a photographer to start sometime during the \u201cgetting-ready\u201d coverage (i.e. prepping) and conclude their coverage at the very tail-end of their wedding (usually when the party is over). Clearly, the more hours you commission, the more you need to pay. The photographer will spend more time photographing your wedding, as well as editing your photos and other related post-wedding services. The quality of your photographer is a bit subjective. Her work needs to appeal to you first as opposed to editors of magazines or the judges of photo competitions. With that said, first start by examining their online reviews (Google, Yelp, WeddingWire, Facebook, website of the artist, etc.). Now, of course, demand for an artist will ultimately drive the price. So if an artist is popular (in-demand), you should expect to pay a premium. And look early (at least 6\u201312 months before your wedding date) if the photographer is popular. Hope that helps and good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Wedding photography coverage cost can vary greatly. It\u2019ll depend on a few things: Duration of coverage (hours? days?)Location (how far is it from where the photographer is based? If far, the client usually pays for the hotel stays and transportation costs)Quality of the photographerExpectations of the clients (does the client want a second shooter or a third shooter [applicable for weddings say, with over 500+ guests])When booking a wedding photographer, one should consider all of above factors. If price shopping, you can easily find people willing to do it for free or for $500 USD on Craigslist. The problem is that the quality will be likely very questionable. For anyone respectable and experienced, you should expect to pay at least $3,000\u20134,000 for a minimum of 8+ hours of coverage. Do keep in mind that albeit a few thousand dollars for a day\u2019s worth of shooting seems like a lot, higher end photographers carry thousands, of not tens of thousands of dollars worth of equipment (and have backup equipment as well), and have invested a lot of time in training and learning. They also have a lot of experience, which means that they\u2019ll be able to work in more difficult situations if they need to. The hours they spend post-processing is in addition very time-consuming\u2014anywhere from 2\u20136x the hours spent shooting (if your wedding was 8 hours of coverage, a higher-end photographer might spend up to 40\u201350 hours culling and editing your photos). The best way to get a sense of this is to simply Google up local photographers, and see how their prices vary (and do take note of the comparisons in quality). Better photographers will have photos in all scenarios (getting-ready, portraits, outdoor/indoor ceremonies, reception, etc.). The weaker photographers usually don\u2019t have many indoor-at-night photos because they don\u2019t know how to light receptions. You can even use my website (in bio) as a reference. Do keep in mind that you get what you pay for. It\u2019s the same with dining at a really nice restaurant: the chef not only has nicer tools, but they know how to cook better. ;) The only difference is that your photos are your memories captured made sharable.

            "answer_text": "A few (hopefully) helpful recommendations: KNOW your worth!! You are now working as a Professional. Not a \u201cnew wedding photographer.\u201d This means you have strong technical and creative foundational skills, the gear, the portfolio of high quality images from being a second-shooter at dozens of other weddings for other photographer(s) so that you can comfortably discuss wedding shots and ideas with the couple like a pro should be able to fluently discuss. You also have the business end of things set up, the insurance, the liability, the LLC, the primary and backup bodies and lenses, the lighting, the contracts, the website, the post-processing tools and experience, the reliable transportation, the second shooter, consultation/pre-sales experience, the bookkeeper/keeping skills , marketing knowledge, the relationships, the passion, and more that you have had to develop, purchase, acquire and practice! So do not undervalue that for yourself\u2014or for the many pro photographers who have walked this walk before you. Don\u2019t forget you also have overhead, ongoing professional development costs, and unexpected expenses that arise. Yet\u2026Rise up! Believe in yourself!!! Sometimes that will be all you can hold onto for a whole as you start out! But it is critical\u2014do hold faith in yourself and your ability to always learn, create and grow!If you do not have the things listed in #1, please go back to #1 and get them. They are not really optional if you are a Professional. This is your client\u2019s most important day in their life thus far and you do not want to implode your business and reputation, your savings, or your sanity if you can\u2019t deliver for them. Some types of photography business are more forgiving. Weddings are sadly not. So don\u2019t practice at the expense of the couple. There are no re-do\u2019s. Be a solid second-shooter first until you feel quite familiar with it all. Besides you will have the confidence you gain on your side when it comes to charging what you need to make this sustainable.If you are good with #1 and #2, my best next advice is to decide your value. And the realities of the work. To do so, I personally estimate that for every hour at a wedding and reception shooting live, there are about 8\u201312 hours of work before and after the event for you. (E.g., consultation time, paperwork prep, billing, calls, scouting the location, coordinating with the other services like the baker, minister, etc., prepping gear, transportation time, time scheduling and briefing second shooter, packing/loading/unpacking at each location of wedding/reception/other shooting spots, and at home, time buffers for arriving early and staying late when stuff. Gets off schedule as many weddings do, post processing time, post-wedding proof prep, the meeting to show the bride her images afterward and make sales, follow-up time, ordering prints for bride, sending thank yous, bookkeeping, etc.Knowing your hours and your actual costs, labor time, etc should help you realistically (important) understand why someone charging $1000 to do a wedding will never ever have a sustainable business model. They are working for pennies or offering so many compromises that you are in a race to the bottom. There are many at the bottom competing for crumbs as it is.Now consider tiered pricing. You can have a $1000 option, but you are designing it to not really be a viable or great choice for most. You want to have the mid and upper tiers be your goal. (Remember the sales rule that when given three tiers of pricing, most never pic the bottom or top).Own your worth. Set your price fairly. You are a valuable service (assuming #1 above is all there), and you are seeking a win-win trade from someone needing your services. Then after your first few weddings, evaluate the feedback, adjust along the way, and increase your prices as you gain more experience. That said, if you set the pricing too low (and you are decent) you will get referrals from people who also have that same budget. So you want to be sure the word of mouth you want is from the clientele you want to draw today and I\u2019m the future.I didn\u2019t give you a number to charge as I don\u2019t know anything about your local market or business goals. But I hope this helps guide you and best of luck! ",

A quick Google search will turn up a billion photographers out there, all desperate for work and many of them will be happy to walk away with only a few hundred pounds.

Here in the UK, a London wedding photographer can earn anything from \u00a3100 per hour to \u00a310,000 per day\u2026..though the higher up the food chain you go, the bigger the reward and the less likely that those photographers will be found using a simple Google search. The uber high end wedding photographers can command really, really big money. There was a photographer in the US called Gary Fong who famously kept inflating his prices over and over again until he was famously charging $100,000 a day. Unsurprisingly he\u2019s since retired from wedding photography! I heard that a very well known photographer in the States (who I won\u2019t name) charges $30,000 a day, though he is world famous and works with the very best wedding planners on the planet. He\u2019s also incredibly talented which helps a lot. So in summary, the world is your oyster. If you want to earn really big money, aim high and shoot for the stars because everybody has to start somewhere. Though if you are happy to get by on an average wage, then it is absolutely possible to do so and to be happy in the process. Wedding photography is a lovely way to earn a living. You get to hang out with people on the happiest of days, surrounded by love and you are the person who is blessed to document the day in pictures. Sounds like a win win to me! Go for it, I say. ",

            "answer_text": "I am offering common sense tips here, I am not a wedding photographer specialist. Pricing depends on several variables such as location and region and the time requested, does it include video, do you need rehearsal dinner and wedding day and what you order in your package. Is this a small wedding or large one. Some photographers will post your photos on a website to pick your photos and some will prepare photo books and other prints or digital media, so make sure you know what your price includes. The photographers experience will factor here too, some are non-negotiable as their reputation speak for itself. Some photographers are contractors so they may have an agency to help locate someone and have extra fees build in. You could pay from $2,000-$ 10000 and more. Most people will shop around according to their budget and others spare no expense when it comes to photographers. It\u2019s the most important part of the wedding plans to remember. Remember they should carry insurance and have the proper equipment to meet your needs. You can expect to pay ~ $ 4- 6,000 for a decent day. ***I\u2019m not a wedding photographer, so I quote this based on other people I know. Independent local photographers can offer the good prices and services since they tend to be low key advertisers. Look at their portfolio and pricing options for what you want. ",

            "answer_text": "How much does a wedding photographer cost? Wedding photographer prices can vary depending on many factors including your wedding\u2019s location (photographers in big cities tend to cost more than in other areas), the type of services and packages you\u2019re looking for, and your chosen photographer\u2019s experience and level of expertise. In general, wedding photographer prices in the IN. tend to range between 8000 and 20,000, with the average wedding photographer cost hovering around 10000. Your wedding photographer will likely comprise about 12 percent of your overall wedding budget. What's covered in a wedding photographer\u2019s prices? When researching wedding photographers, be sure to read the information about their pricing and packages carefully\u2014these tend to differ widely from photographer to photographer and can greatly affect wedding photography pricing. A few items and services to look for include: Time: Wedding photographer prices typically include between six hours and an unlimited amount of coverage. The more time you\u2019d like your photographer to cover your event, the more you\u2019ll have to pay. Additional hours will cost extra.Travel: Does your photographer have to travel a long distance to your event? You may have to pay a per-mile charge if he or she is driving to your wedding, or you might have to pay for airfare and accommodations for a destination wedding.Second Shooters/Staffing: Will your photographer have a second shooter or assistants present? If so, expect to shell out more.Editing: A large part of your photographer\u2019s time will be spent editing and retouching your wedding photos to make sure they look absolutely amazing.Images: Your wedding photographer\u2019s cost should include the actual images. Digital files can be provided to you in a variety of ways including in an online gallery and/or via a USB drive.Print release: Many wedding photography packages include a \u201cprint release,\u201d which means that you can use the photos for your own personal use. However, be aware that you will likely not have a full \u201ccopyright release,\u201d so you don\u2019t own the photos and can\u2019t sell them, and that your photographer can use your photos for marketing purposes.Prints: Some photographers include photo prints (or a print credit\u2014money you can put toward purchasing prints) in their wedding photography rates. While you don\u2019t have to purchase your prints through your photographer, they\u2019ll likely come out better if you do.Albums: Your photographer may offer a wedding album as part of his or her package. You can choose whether you\u2019d like to design and purchase your album through your photographer or do it through another service.Additional shoots: Some photographers include an engagement shoot in their package (62 percent of couples do a pre-wedding engagement shoot). Other shoots that will likely cost extra include bridal portraits, trash the dress sessions, or coverage of your rehearsal dinner.There are other, less obvious parts of a wedding photographer\u2019s business that may be included in their package pricing, which include equipment, employees, business expenses, marketing, liability insurance, and more. Do I need to tip my wedding photographer? While tips aren\u2019t included in a photographer\u2019s package, they are certainly something you should factor into your wedding photography budget. If your photographer owns his or her business, you don\u2019t need to tip, but if he or she works for a larger company, a 500 to 1000 tip is a nice gesture. You should also write an online review for your photographer as an added thank-you. When should you hire a wedding photographer? Wedding photographers are usually among the first vendors couples book after they secure their venue. We recommend starting the search for your photographer about 11 months before your big day. What are the different wedding photography styles? As you start researching wedding photographers by checking out their work and reading their online reviews, be sure to pinpoint the wedding photography style you like best. There are a few wedding photography styles to choose from, including: Photojournalism: This wedding photography style is all about telling a story. The photographer will capture candid, emotional moments as opposed to posed portraits.Traditional: A more formal, classic photography style, traditional wedding photography includes lots of posed shots.Fine Art: This style is all about dramatic compositions and stylized images. It\u2019s a more modern approach that creates frame-worthy images.Fashion: If you want images that focus on your attire and look like they belong in a magazine, this is the wedding photography style for you. Think creative backdrops and unique poses.Vintage: This photography style uses filters and other techniques to give your wedding photos an old-school feel.Should I get a second shooter for my wedding? When it comes to the great \u201cone versus two wedding photographers\u201d debate, the \u201cright\u201d answer tends to vary from photographer to photographer, and often depends on the size of your wedding. If you\u2019re having a very intimate and small wedding, having just one photographer present may suffice. However, if you\u2019re hosting a larger wedding with lots of guests, you will likely need a main photographer as well as a second photographer, and perhaps assistants to help with lighting and coordination. 35 percent of wedding photographers include a second shooter in their starting rates, but for many, it's a separate charge. Having a second shooter can be beneficial in capturing different perspectives and angles throughout the day\u2014and can make your wedding-day timeline run even more smoothly. With two photographers on hand, both your and your future spouse\u2019s getting-ready processes can be photographed at the same time. It\u2019s best to discuss your specific wedding and needs with your photographer to determine the best staffing situation. Are albums included in a wedding photographer's prices? Many photographers do include an album in their wedding photography rates. However, some photographers offer it as a separate line item, which can add several hundred dollars to your total. There are indeed other services that allow you to create your own wedding photo album, but it can sometimes be more seamless to go through your own photographer. Do I have to cover my wedding photographer's travel costs? If your wedding photographer is based near your wedding location, you likely won\u2019t have to pay any additional travel costs. However, if your photographer will be traveling a significant distance (often over 60 miles), you will likely incur additional travel costs, up to $2 per mile or more. If your photographer is flying to your wedding destination, you will probably have to pay for his/her airfare and accommodations, as well as an additional travel fee. Again, these wedding photographer prices vary from pro to pro, so be sure to ask your chosen photographer for pricing details before booking. Do I have to pay for my wedding photographer's meals? For your wedding vendors who will be present during your actual wedding (your photographer, videographer, DJ, wedding planner, etc.) you will need to provide hot meals. Yes, this is indeed an added expense that you might not have expected to incur, but it\u2019s an important one\u2014vendors who are well-fed and happy will better be able to bring their A-game for your big day! Your wedding caterer is likely accustomed to providing these vendor meals, so be sure to discuss this with them. Tahnku ",

The amount of time it takes to edit wedding photos can go into the hundreds of hours if you're anal like me, colour balancing, cropping, retouching and so on\u2026 then there's requests for certain photos at certain sizes (where crops don't work), customer service, the actual shooting (which literally takes anywhere from 1% to 30% of the job's actual time and so on. If I did the math, them I would want $2000 for shooting the event plus post-processing which would quickly amount to $6000 or more total. Don't forget you're paying for the experience and artistic eye of the photographer. Good gear is important too, which only increases the cost when a single lens can cost over $2000. You can hire your \u201ccwac\u201d (cousin with a camera) and they'll probably do a good job, but a good wedding photographer has poses, experience and technical knowledge to get the most out of an occasion.

Wedding picture taker costs can fluctuate contingent upon numerous elements including your wedding's area (photographic artists in enormous urban communities will in general cost more than in different zones), the sort of administrations and bundles you're searching for, and your picked photographic artist's understanding and level of skill. As a rule, wedding picture taker costs in the U.S. will in general range somewhere in the range of $1,150 and $3,000, with the normal wedding picture taker cost drifting around $2,000. What's canvassed in a wedding picture taker's costs? When exploring wedding picture takers, make certain to peruse the data about their evaluating and bundles cautiously\u2014these will in general vary broadly from picture taker to picture taker and can significantly influence wedding photography valuing.

Computerized records can be given to you in an assortment of ways remembering for an online exhibition or potentially by means of a USB drive. Print discharge: Many wedding photography bundles incorporate a \"print discharge,\" which implies that you can utilize the photographs for your very own utilization. In any case, know that you will probably not have a full \"copyright discharge,\" so you don't claim the photographs and can't sell them, and that your picture taker can utilize your photographs for promoting purposes. Prints: Some picture takers incorporate photograph prints (or a print credit\u2014cash you can put toward buying prints) in their wedding photography rates. While you don't need to buy your prints through your picture taker, they'll likely come out better on the off chance that you do. Collections: Your picture taker may offer a wedding collection as a major aspect of their bundle. You can pick whether you'd prefer to structure and buy your collection through your picture taker or do it through another assistance.

            "answer_text": "This is a tough question because it\u2019s a value question, right? What do you, the couple getting married, value? I think you should budget between 15% to 20% of your total wedding budget on photography, but if you don\u2019t care about photography you might laugh and say that is way to much. In most major markets you can find a photographer who will show up and take photographs in a style close to what you want for $3500. There isn\u2019t a direct correlation between how much you spend and the quality of photos you get from your wedding photographer. But the photographer who makes $3500 a wedding has to photograph a lot of weddings to live in a major market, and has a lot less time to spend working on your images, emailing with you about your wedding timeline, or scouting your venue with you to find out what you like and don't like. Plus, the more time you spend with your photographer the more comfortable you are the better the images are and a photographer servicing a lot of clients doesn't have the time. Photographers also burn out very quickly over working themselves. When you are asking what is a reasonable price for a wedding photographer you first need to ask yourself what do I expect from my wedding photographer? Yes, a really amazing photographer is going to cost more. But more importantly a photographer who is going to have the time to connect with you, answer your questions quickly, and take care with your wedding photos is going to cost more as well. So, if you are still reading this I\u2019d say plan to spend a minimum of $4500 if you want a good photographer, and don\u2019t be surprised that amazing photos and great customer service will cost between $5500 and $7500. I also don\u2019t think it would be unreasonable to spend more for wedding photography when your budget for the wedding get upwards of $65000, but at that point I\u2019m guessing you might not be on Quora looking for what the answer to this question. Another good question I\u2019d like to answer is why photography cost goes up to some degree as the overall cost of the wedding does. ",

There\u2019s no going back & doing reshoots. Meet with Photographers, look at Samples of their work of Weddings. Not just their Best Shots. Anyone can do that. When I started doing Weddings I always shot with an Experienced Wedding Photographer and as I learned I increased my Price & what I offered. Now I typically hire a close Friend that\u2019s also a Professional Photographer to shoot Weddings with me as there\u2019s no way on a good sized Wedding, or a Jewish or Greek Wedding One Photographer can be everywhere & Capture all the Special moments as some of those Weddings have Strict Restrictions on where a Photographer can be & do, such as a Greek Wedding there\u2019s No Photos allowed during Prayer and you can be moving around during one either so with Two Photographers I can be assured that I can deliver to the couple all of those Special moments plus when shooting the Couple, Attendants, Family etc after the Ceremony one Photographer does the groupings, Posing / how & where to stand while the other Shoots the Photos while the other one assures everyone looks good as he looks on, and time is of the essence during this time so everyone can get to the Reception as Guest are awaiting the Happy Couple & Attendants so two photographers cuts the photo time in half also. So look at Samples of Weddings, ask how they work , arrival for Bride & Groom Dressing, Time they will be there and how do they work with finding out who everyone is that\u2019s important as in Family Members etc that you\u2019d want photographed, as I always have the Bride assign one of her Best Friends or a Sister etc.. , who knows everyone & who the Bride & Groom want photographed. I do this because it\u2019s the Bride & Grooms Special Day & last thing they need is a Photographer to be constantly bugging them who & what they\u2019d like photographed and there\u2019s no way to know beforehand & this way I can be assured of capturing all Special people & Family they\u2019d like photographed as there\u2019s usually people from out of town that traveled there and working with someone that agreed to help the Bride leaves the Happy Couple able to just Enjoy their Special Day. Pricing will vary by photographers. Speak to several, get recommendations etc to find that One Photographer that you like him or her , their work and how you feel their work with you. You\u2019ll get pretty much what you pay for with an Experienced Wedding Photographer as there\u2019s no reshoots. I also offer \u201cFor Your Eyes Only\u201d shoots for the Bride, Photos of the couple at a place or park of their choice. hope all this has helped. ",

Eventually I got good enough to go out on my own with the studio\u2019s blessing. It was a process. In all I shot over 300 weddings and did quite well. I also had a home studio that brought in cash.

If you have a girl friend, take time to check out local studios to see what they are charging (pose as a potential client) or go online and check prices if they list them.

            "answer_text": "This has been asked before. There is no fixed cost for a wedding event. There are so many factors to consider, from the reputation, skills, technical prowess, insurance, etc\u2026there are so much to consider. Each couple has their own uniques wishes to be fullfiled and rightly so. Some are quite easy and routine for us. However, the most over riding factor I do consider is the Complexity of the wishes. My deals are pretty standard, it always for three days, pre, post and game day. With my routine, thats pretty much 3 full days of work but it is mostly the same price with others just for the wedding event day. I love weddings, I love photography so the extra time and effort and the extra thousands of photos are simply paradise for me to post process.Usually, my clients ends up with close to 4000 photos and several sets using my custom filters. Clients love the tons of photos they could share\u2026it would take months for them to share it online\u2026Which is a good bargain/ Again, deal with me tend to be middle to higher end range for most European Countries, I travel anywhere, and enjoy the experience as well. So with me I offer the lower pricing relative to others because for me its more of a paid hobby so I could buy new gadgets. It is just part business. My social media management works are enough. Plus being SMM helps as well so another bonus. So shop around and ask. There is no harm in asking\u2026if the photographer is reluctant with entertaining legitimate client then its a red flag. Good luck with yoursearch. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all you want good pictures right? That requires experience, good equipment, and the psychological skills necessary to deal with all the fricking personalities colliding on a special occasion. In a wedding there are no do overs if something goes wrong. It\u2019s similar to a war zone in that way. You have to get all the important shots in before anyone eats or spills wine all over their beautiful dresses and suits. So a good photographer is busy from the get go. The brides family, the groom\u2019s family etc. Then there\u2019s the work of editing, retouching, matting and framing. Plus the official wedding album and orders for pictures. Then there\u2019s the costs of running your own business, and collecting when people refuse to pay off the balance or order things they can\u2019t afford. It takes a special kind of person to do wedding photography. Sure it\u2019s big money, but also big hassles, and a high level of risk involved. Plus most people have no idea what it entails and therefore think they can get away with getting the artsy college kid to take the pictures for cheap. All strategies have their plus and minus. Just remember you get what you pay for, and after 6 months you\u2019ll probably never look at those pictures again lol. ",

            "answer_text": "I will hope you\u2019re speaking about a professional that specializes in wedding photography and has a good reputation for shooting weddings. The range will likely start at $1,800 and go to $3,500. They can also be much higher depending on where they are and where your wedding will be (Distance away from your wedding location), what time of year (May through October - Wedding Season), What day of the week (Saturdays are usually the costliest) The wedding format Time needed to shoot all you wanted shot, whether a second or 3rd shooter is required. If your wedding is a several day affair, costs will be much higher. Go to bridal shows, visit the wedding websites that are in your area. Talk with them. You will be spending lots of time with them on your wedding day. There are many expenses that go into being a better wedding photographer that can include training, equipment, insurances and marketing to name a few. Hope that helps. Richard ",

            "answer_text": "Because you're paying for a skilled person for their livelihood. Shooting a wedding isn't 4 hours of work. It's a week or two of work with overhead expenses, and time invested in marketing themselves, selling, and they get to pay taxes too. If you think of their time as worth about $50 per hour, that's about $2000 for a wedding, and that is a solid baseline for a professional. In reality it's more than 40 hours of work. Costs will of course be higher for a good photographer or in an expensive area. If someone's services are in demand, they can charge more. They aren't going to charge a fee that they can't live on unless they're just a hobbyist photographer that is willing to do it for the experience. If you look at it as a full time job where you don't have work every week, you night understand the pricing better. ",

In 1999 I worked for a company (since closed) that paid its photographers about $250 a wedding (it was a low end company).  Great experience tho, really. Oftentimes clients think that the $3,000 I charge for a wedding (average) is all going in my pocket.  Given that there are a limited number of days people get married (weekends) and a great deal of back end work, it's not a profession that leads to unlimited wealth in terms of money.   But if you truly love what you do, and I do, then it is a job that blurs the line between work and play. ",

As a business they also need some profit to invest back in to the business for things like equipment.

The package costs included candid photography, videography,album editing ,video editing and the equipements.The total charge will increase if the number of sheets in your wedding album increases. This was actually a sweet deal considering the number of days and the events that had to cover. But normally for weddings in Kerala if you go by the above package it will take 1 to 2 lakhs for one day wedding. This will also include outdoor shooting and use of equipements like drone for video shooting .Yes you heard it right. Drones. (Will upload a pic as soon as I get it.) ",

The environment often cannot be controlled, so the photographer has to very good at judging the good shot from an excellent one in a matter of seconds. The photographer bears the burden of selecting the pictures for you, and should deliver an excellent visual story. It is a lot of work. Demanding work at that. You are paying someone who is a technician, an artist, an engineer, and a writer. And on top of it all, that poor soul has to put up with a drunk wedding party. Pay up! ",

They have to create a memory that is pleasing for the wedding couple and family.
