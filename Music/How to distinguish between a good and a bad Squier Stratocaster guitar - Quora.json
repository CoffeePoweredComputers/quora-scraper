            "answer_text": "I agree with the recommendation to have a more experienced player accompany you, but I would also advise you not to restrict yourself to a Squier. Even back in the days when Squiers were made in Japan, there were certainly good and bad examples, nowadays you can find everything from MIM (made in Mexico) through made in Corea or China. The difference is reflected in the choice and quality of both the hardware and the tonewoods. Real Strats are mostly made of alder or ash, with a maple neck and fretboard or maple and rosewood or ebony fretboard in the Deluxe models. The Chinese made versions will use poplar or other cheap wood. The electronics and other hardware will definitely be of inferior quality. I am not knocking Asian craftsmanship by any means, but you really need to do your homework so you know what you are buying. Many of the big name brands like Fender and Gibson are in my opinion overpriced and over-rated, with many models manufactured in Asia anyway. What you need to consider is that Squier is just a cheaper branch of the Fender brand. If what you want is a Fender Stratocaster, you need to know that pretty much every brand manufactures a version of both a Strat and Tele type electric guitar. Many of these in my opinion offer a better standard tban most Squiers you can buy off the shelf, and furthermore if you look at the used/second hand market you are likely to find far better options Wben looking for your first guitar, it is probably more important to acquire an instrument that will not hamper your progress. A poorly set up instrument with a high action may make you give up before you really get anywhere. A more experienced player will be able to determine whether an instrument with a less than usable action can be set up to play well or whether it is just badly put together in the first place. If you decide to by used, then don't discount the possibility of picking up a bargain at your local pawn brokers. There are definitely bargains to behad if you know what you are buying. Here is a check list of thinga I would check before choosing a particular instrument - as you will see, there is a lot to take into consideration, and this is not something that can be done quickly - take your time! : Is the neck straight, and if not, will the truss-rod allow adjustment to straighten it? If not then forget it.Is the action (string height) reasonable? Is the intonation correct? (the same tone should be heard in each of the open strings, then at the 12th fret, as well as the harmonic at the 12th fret. Again, this is normally adjustable by moving the string saddles forward or backward, but if the kntonation is out it zoes not bode well for the quality of the finish and quality control. If the intonation is out it will be impossible to accurately tune the instrument. Also check the tuners. Do they turn easily with no play at the posts? If it is a tremolo model, wang the tremolo a few times roughly - does this cause the guitar to go out of tune?What state are the frets in - are they worn (if used), do they have rough edges or are each of the fret ends nicely rounded so they don't damage your hands? Again if tbe frets are roughly finished this will require more work. Play every note at eaxh fret of every string. Is there any buzz, (on a Strat type guitar a little string buzz is unavoidable, especially played acousically) and do any of the notes choke when the strings arw bent? A copy of a 50's or 60's Strat will have thinner frets and a rounder cambee on the fretboard than more contemporary instruments, and string choking was therefore more common. In these instruments the truss-rod adjuster was also found at the back of the neck, making adjustment more difficult - as opposed to the later designs, in which the truss-rod adjuster is found behind the nut. Check the height of the nut slots too. Fretting the 1st fret, the string should not go out of tune when applying pressure.What state are the strings in? If they are obviously tarnished or oxidised (and if purchasing from a store they probably will be), this will be your first purchase, because a new set of strings will often improve the feel of the guitar a great deal, and used strings also intone badly and are more likely to break when tuned to pitch.How does the guitar balance? Does it feel comfortable? If the instrument is neck heavy, steer clear of it. Compare how the guitar feels both using a strap and sitting down with it on your lap.How heavy is the guitar? If it is very heavy it's going to be tiring to play and can lead to unnecessary strain on your shoulders and back. Weight also does not necessarily equate with good tone - especially with Strats. Lighter weight Strats are often brighter and more resonant.Compare the acoustic sound of several guitars at different price points. How do they compare? It doesn't matter whether you can play it or not - just play all the strings open and listen to the tone and timbre of the sound. This is one of the best ways to judge tonal characteristics such as warmth/clarity or muddiness, sustain, and how much the body and neck resonate/vibrate. A good electric guitar should resonate against your body and in your fingers. It should sound warm yet clear, with good definition throughout the tonal spectrum from bass through treble. If the guitar sounds good acoustically it should sound even better once amplified (if not, then you can often improve rhings by upgrading the \u00f1ickups and electronics). If it sounds dull and lifeless unamplified then there is little you can do to improve this, unless it is due to dead strings.Once amplified, how does it sound compared to its acoustic sound? Check the sound in each of the 5 positions of the pickup selector. Check the volume and tone controls - do the controls move freely with no scratxhiness or graininess? Is the increase in volume smooth, and does the tone move smoothly from treble to bass frequencies?Check the pickup height of each of the pickups. Fret the guitar at the highest fret then look at the distance between the string and the pickup magnet. Too close and it will pull the string out of tune.The last consideration is the appearance of the guitar. If you are buying used, don't let a few dings and scratches put you off, unless the guitar has obviously been abused. You may end up paying less than new and get better value for your money. Most stores will carry a range of new and used gear.I hope you find this helpful. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "When it comes to buying your first guitar it can be a little intimidating. So many to choose from & so many different opinions about certain brands.  Some say they\u2019re good, some say they\u2019re bad (like the squire) and one doesn\u2019t know what to think. It can get a bit confusing to move forward on a purchase without an informed buying decision. Guitars can be like anything else. They can come out great or not so great depending on the day they were made. The attitude of the worker making it, the day (say it\u2019s a Friday & they\u2019re ready for the weekend) maybe as much care isn\u2019t put into it at that point. Or on the other hand, it could be made by someone who really cares about their job. Cars are like that too. When they\u2019re bad people call them\u201dlemons\u201d and guitars can be the same way. Especially massed produced guitars made in other countries where maybe they\u2019re \u201cquality control\u201d standards might not be as high as say in America.  With all that being said, here\u2019s a few things to look for when buying your first guitar no matter the brand (and yes Fender Squire is a good beginner guitar. I\u2019d also recommend you look into a Ibanez Gio) Here are some \u201cbuying your first guitar\u201d tips: 1.) Make sure you like the look of the guitar 2.) Make sure it\u2019s comfortable to play (strings aren\u2019t too high off the fretboard (very common among the cheaper massed produced guitars) 3.) Make sure it stays in-tune. (even cheaper beginner guitars should stay in-tune a little bit) 4.) Make sure it sounds like you want it to. (this can change with the amp it\u2019s plugged into) 5.) Try out a couple different ones of the brand you like or try out some different brands. 6.) If need be, pay a little money and make sure it\u2019s set up properly by a professional technician. The set-up on a guitar can make a HUGE difference in it\u2019s performance. If a beginner guitar ($100) is set up properly, it can outperform a higher end guitar ($500) that is not set up properly. Guitars come out of the MFG with a general set up because everyone is different. So when you buy a guitar you like, if you have it set up to your liking (string hight, bridge intonation, etc) the guitar should play well & stay in-tune. I hope this helped answer your question.

            "answer_text": "Personally, a Squier Affinty Stratocaster would sound a little more \u2018muddled\u2019 than a Squier Standard and of course the standard Fender Stratocaster. I personally bought one a couple of days back and find it to sound a little clearer. Squier Affinity Stratocaster bodies are usually made of Alder wood or Agathis wood, and depending on the model, some of them are constructed with more than two or three parts of the body being joined together. To my knowledge, some models such as the Standard is constructed of a solid Alder wood body. I\u2019ve also heard that the Affinity and the Bullet Stratocaster models have thinner bodies, whereas the standards are slightly thicker with larger CBS headstocks. It\u2019s just off the top of my head but I would personally favour the Standard and Classic vibe models compared to the Affinity series. In the end, its down to how well the player is! ",

            "answer_text": "Awesome question. A squier strat is a great starter guitar that you will love to learn on. First off, make sure it's not crazy cheap, particularly if it is new. This may sound weird but there is a reason they are selling it so cheap. Next make sure the neck is not warped. If it is bent to high the strings will be high off the fretboard, if you are at a music store like GC or something like that just ask them to have the tech take a look at it and it may just be the truss rod needs tightening. If it is a used music store then put that thing away and run. Next, make sure the guitar has stock pickups or better. Sometimes people keep the pickups and sell the guitar so. Other than that plug it in and play it. Good luck! ",

I\u2019ve yet to see a Squire Affinity that was good for anything other than firewood, IMHO. Sure, you\u2019re not stuck with what comes out of the box, but even if you spend as much to upgrade as you paid for the guitar to begin with, at the end of the day a $200 guitar is still a $200 guitar, plus you\u2019ve now spent enough that you could have bought a Classic Vibe, which are usually decent guitars for the price. But why settle for a Squire at all? For the same price as a new Classic Vibe, or perhaps a little more, you could get a good used MIM Fender. And that\u2019s my recommendation. ",

I have also experimented with various strings to get what I feel is the optimal balance between sound quality and comfort. However, don\u2019t feel as if you have to limit yourself to a cheaper guitar, maybe spending more on a more desirable guitar could provide the motivation to keep on learning. I find that you\u2019re better off going to a store and actually trying the guitar before you buy it - the appearance and brand of a guitar doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s right for you! ",

I ended up buying a Korean made Cort for only US$ 200 while the American-made Stratocaster started from US$ 1,300. Not even close, but its still OK for learning to play electric guitar. ",
