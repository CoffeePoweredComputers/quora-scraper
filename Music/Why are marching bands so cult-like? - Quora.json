            "answer_text": "I was in Marching Band for 3 years in high school and 4 years in college. It is rather nerdy from the perspective of people who are not in it, but I don\u2019t think it is very cult-like. Perhaps a better description would be that it is a \u201cdisciplined\u201d endeavor. Much like a sports team, it requires attention to detail in many different areas. Band members have to learn and then memorize their parts. They have to learn and memorize their moves across the field. They have to practice playing and moving together. They have to break off into specialty teams (known as sectionals) in order to make sure each member of the specialty team is top-notch. The members have to exercise in order to be physically fit so that they can march and stand for hours as well as endure the heat of heavy uniforms and carry heavy instruments (depending on what they play). Often, Marching Bands also participate in competitions with other Marching Bands. So it is necessary to be dedicated to the cause and it requires a great deal of discipline Some might see this as a lot to endure just to be part of a Marching Band, but it is really no more strange than someone who plays on a sports team. Athletes love sports. Musicians love bands. It\u2019s all about what moves you. There is also something special about finding other people who share your passion. So band members often become close friends. In the end though, no one is forced to march in a band. No one is prevented from leaving a band. No one is told what to believe. So it is not cult-like, but it can be a passionate endeavor. ",

            "answer_text": "I started laughing at this really hard because the more I think about it the more it really does seem like a cult. I can see where you're coming from, as I was in a similar position for a couple weeks in my freshman year. I had one of my middle school friends tell me she wouldn't talk to me unless I did marching band. Marching band is a major part of its members lives, and if you're not in it, you can't understand the amount of work the members go through. All the inside jokes that are made during season, you can't be apart of. Marching band members spend half of their day together. That's including the time spent sleeping. 12 hour rehearsals are a thing over the summer. Finally, there's music that they are playing that you can't play with them. They practice this music constantly, and it has become a part of them, but it's not a part of you. There's situations that marching band members go into that nobody else does. These situations and experiences are unique and have become a huge part of the marching band member's life, and with our being a part of it, there's no way to relate to a big part of who they are. Tldr: Marching band members spend so much time together that outsiders often cannot relate. ",
