            "answer_text": "there are two reasons why i love J-pop more than K-pop J-pop is nostalgic.I\u2019ve been watching anime for a long time and a lot of their openings, especially the old ones are really iconic. Plus, the visuals can be so astounding, you can replicate them in your mind just by listening to the song. K-pop is pretty generic. It doesn\u2019t have that nostalgic heartwarming feel. This other reason might be offensive to K-pop fans. THE GIRL GROUP AND BOY GROUP MEMBERS LOOK OOOH SOOO UGGGGLLLYYYYYY!! I mean, god!! I can\u2019t stand looking at BTS member faces for more than two seconds. They look so gay with their excessive makeup. Heck I can\u2019t even distinguish who\u2019s who, they all look the same!! Another contributing factor will be the fanbase. The J-pop fanbase is way better than the K-pop fanbase. Mesmerised by their looks, K-pop fans will squeal in delight when \u201cFake Love\u201d by BTS plays and will probably say \u201c YEASSS JUNG KOOK IS SO CUUUUTE!!\u201d. After some time this gets frikking annoying in comparison the J-pop fanbase doesn\u2019t gush over girl group or boy group members. They\u2019ll just say \u201cdamn, the ladies of Kalafina are hot\u201d not \u201cOHHH MY GOD, SO AND SO FROM KALAFINA IS BAEEE!\u201d(Yes even Apple Music said the members of Kalafina are hot) The environment is much less chaotic ",

            "answer_text": "Because the music is different. In Jpop I think there are even more girly concepts, or weird concepts. Their are also a lot of rock in Jpop. Kpop is more Pop. Jpop is pretty unique but so is Kpop. I think the Jpop group AAA is amazing, there is no boy/girl groups like them, and they are so talented. I also like Bullet Train, they are definitely a wierd group but they are good.I love kpop. There are definitely some kpop groups I just can\u2019t get in to and some I love. But I think the kpop group Dreamcatcher sounds a lot like Japanese rock bands, they are a girlgroup. There is also a group called vixx, you probably haven\u2019t heard of them but they have a lot of dark concepts, but interesting, they never follow the trends and every concept is completely different from the last.If you can\u2019t get into kpop then check them out, they were the first kpop group I could get into.
