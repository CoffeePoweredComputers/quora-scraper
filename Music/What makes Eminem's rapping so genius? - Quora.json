            "answer_text": "The way he puts together rhymes is so cleverly and compulsively done that you wonder sometimes if Eminem doesn\u2019t have autism or something like that. Eminem has admitted that he constantly thinks of rhymes, I believe in his words he even, jokingly, called it \u201ca disease\u201d. And he jots down all these rhymes on notepads the old school way. And the astounding thing is that Eminem doesn\u2019t use a really erudite vocabulary, such as someone like Aesop Rock does. Rather, he takes commonly known, few-syllable words and puts them together in incredibly intriguing ways that pull your ear into the rhyme scheme. This is an excerpt from the new Ed Sheeran song \u201cRemember The Name\u201d, that strangely features Eminem and 50 Cent. Anything is possible in music these days I guess, and I for one am actually ecstatic that this happened. We get \u201cold vibes\u201d from this track, with the Dr. Dre-esque, 2004 club-type beat and the Nate Dogg-esque hook, And the two features do not disappoint in the vein of this nostalgia. In Eminem\u2019s verse, he raps \u201cBut they said time would tell (What?) if I'd prevail (Huh?)\nAnd all I did was (What?) put nine inch nails (Where?)\nIn my eyelids now (What?)I'm seein' diamond sales like I'm in Zales (Yeah) This isn\u2019t even a very long rhyme scheme for Eminem, but the four-bar method never fails to attract the ear to the rhyming syllables. Again, none of the words are unfamiliar, so it\u2019s easy for the listener to relate to the lyrics. And Eminem\u2019s well-known habit of crafting multisyllabic rhymes (\u201ctime would tell\u201d, \u201cI\u2019d prevail\u201d, \u201cnine inch nails\u201d, \u201ceyelids now\u201d, \u201cdiamond sales\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m in Zales\u201d) makes for more captivating rhymes because the brain has more rhyming syllables to process. Another technique Eminem employs to create more rhyming syllables to put together is the way he bends words to make them rhyme. By all phonetic accounts, \u201ceyelids now\u201d shouldn\u2019t rhyme with \u201cdiamond sales\u201d, but the way Eminem bends \u201ceyelids now\u201d to sound like the vowel sounds in the rest of the rhyme scheme adds another multisyllabic rhyme to the scheme. One thing that I really appreciate about Em\u2019s verse here is the \u201cI\u2019m seein\u2019 diamond sales, like I\u2019m in Zales\u201d. This is a great example of how Eminem puts simple words together to make great rhymes. Another one of my favorite recent lines from Eminem is from his verse on A Boogie\u2019s song \u201cRainy Days\u201d, where Em says \u201cI gotta idea, like the clerk when you try\u2019na buy beer\u201d. This a simple line with word-bending and a clever play on words with \u201cI gotta idea\u201d (I gotta ID her), \u201clike the clerk when you try\u2019na buy beer\u201d. I had to just pause the song and chuckle the first time I heard that. Point is, Eminem knows how to craft incredibly interesting, attractive, frequently intricate rhymes and rhyme schemes while painting vivid pictures with his wordplay. ",

            "answer_text": "I'll start with an incident. In an interview, Eminem was asked about what is something which he finds bizarre. He replied that he was appalled by people who say the word \u2018Orange' doesn't rhyme with anything. In an improvised rap he stated he can find various words and phrases to rhyme with the word. \u201cOrange, door hinge, 4-inch in storage eating porridge, with Geor-ge.\u201d  I was thrilled when I heard this. I researched more and more about his style and flow. I came across a multitude of facts which gave me an idea about the prowess of Marshal Mathers (Eminem, derived from M&M, his initials). He extensively studies the dictionary to find words he can incorporate in his raps. Another reason why he really is Rap God is because he is so dedicated and passionate about his art, that he doesn't just see things happening in his life, he tries to listen to them as well. We can even find him rapping about the hardest phases of his life in songs like \u2018Kim\u2019 and \u2018Cleaning out my closet\u2019. His loyalty towards his art is unmatched. Eg. If you want to get signed by his label, you have to have a 1 on 1 rap battle with him.  After rigorous practice and guidance under other phenomenal artists like Dr. Dre, I believe that he has evolved his subconscious mind to associate a rhyme with most of the things happening around him. The ultimate beats which make his raps so eargasmic can be attributed to his time spent with Dr. Dre. In short, he knows what people want. He know what pumps up our bodies with adrenaline (Listen Till I Collapse). He knows what brings us motivation (Listen Lose Yourself). He knows how to get our bodies moving (Listen Berzerk). He knows how to shock us (Listen Stan). And he how to make us go BwaHaHaHa (Listen Just Lose It).  He is constantly evolving and he doesn't limit himself to one style. He knows when to spit what. With his great combination of speed, rhythm, lyrics, and flow; I can say without a doubt that he is the best rapper ever. No offense to Tupac's, Nas\u2019 or Biggie Smalls' fans. PS- He doesn't give a fuck. ",

            "answer_text": "Eminem's Revival- Or is it? Growing up with the Slim Shady rap about his dark and doomed life history, I had always known that multiple failures were never the end of the line. It kept me going at times when everything was falling apart. I struggled against all the odds with Em\u2019s Lose yourself in the loop. The fear of failure was the most prominent motivation I could ever have. Unfortunately, it was that fear that drove Eminem to make those timeless classics that still dominate everyone\u2019s playlists. Songs like Cleaning out my closet, Kim, Mockingbird, and Stan were all born out of the rage Em had against his past. His alcoholic mother, problematic wife, and persistent substance abuse gave him the power to weave words together and make beautiful lyrical canvasses out of it. His drug problem and his incessant hate for his ex-wife brought out the best in him that had fans riding a million emotional roller coasters listening to Em spew words out of his mouth. In his early days, Marshall Mathers wanted to do something about the shit-pile of a life, he was leading. He was desperate to get rid of the negativities and channeled all his rage and anger into his songs. That gave him the edge over all the other contemporary rappers who were only focussing on how great their cars were or how curvy their women were. Eventually, Marshall won everything there is to be and was clearly at the top of the rung. He got sober, got his shit together and started providing for his daughter. Fast forward to 2017, meet Eminem, a rich guy in his mid-forties with a comfortable life, taking care of his daughter, proclaimed by many as the best rapper that ever was. He got clean and was finally living the life he always yearned for. Unfortunately, it is this success that killed the music in him. Without his pain and suffering, his rhymes have lost their steam. His words don\u2019t have the sting they used to before. Yes, they still rhyme, but they don\u2019t give me goosebumps anymore. They are just words that were strung together by a man who lost his cause. Revival, Em\u2019s latest album with 19 tracks, is a tragic attempt at his legacy. Weak beats and cringe-worthy punchlines make it a cumbersome listen. His collaborators in the album have done a good job, but even Beyonce and Ed-Sheeran coudld not save the album. I write this review, my first attempt at one, with a heavy heart and say that, with Em losing all his pain and rage, his words have lost steam. The pathetic beats in the background do little to his cause. Quoting the rap-god, \u201cMan, in my younger days That dream was so much fun to chase It\u2019s like I run in place While this shit dangled in front of my face But how do you keep up the pace And the hunger pains once you\u2019ve won the race?\u201d That made him a genius and explains why his last two albums were not as good as they were supposed to be ",

            "answer_text": "I totally agree with you, he's on a whole different level. When Eminem raps, his lyrics make sense, and we can identify with what he's rapping about(because we face the same problems...)Also, you feel a bit of sympathy for him in most of his songs...take mockingbird, lose yourself, etc. as examplesHis vocabulary is great, and he doesnt slur the words up as others(lil' wayne).In the end, I'd say the way he can put the fuck word in every verse,every line, as simple as nursery rhyme is the real reason!!!!
