            "answer_text": "My favorite album ever is \u201cClose to the Edge\u201d, written & performed by Yes (Jon Anderson/Steve Howe/Rick Wakeman/Chris Squire/Bill Bruford). This album was released in 1972, and still sounds fresh af to a youngling like me (I\u2019m 23!). This was the last album Bruford made with the band before leaving for King Crimson.  This album is an incredible piece of Progressive Rock. In order to fully grasp its greatness, one must remember Yes was still going strong after the release of the previous album called \u201cFragile\u201d (1971). Rick Wakeman had just joined the band after \u201cThe Yes Album\u201d (1971) and the departure of Tony Kaye, and was very young back then. But still managed to pull off incredible synth techniques in \u201cRoundabout\u201d for instance. But the best was yet to come. \u201cClose to the Edge\u201d seriously marks something for the band, as they were already going for more conceptual pieces since \u201cThe Yes album\u201d. Longer tracks started to appear on their albums, and CTTE marks the step towards what will be a very complex era for Yes music-wise. This album is formed of 3 tracks : Close to the Edge - a 20 min piece divided in 4 segments. The intro of this track is absolutely mental as we immediately begin with Steve Howe\u2019s guitar solo, wonderfully underlined by the bass, the drums and the synths. This track is the definition of completion in music, as there is nothing to be taken away, and also nothing to add. When you go through the whole thing, the ending makes so much sense\u2026 Awesome track!And You And I - a 10 min piece also divided in 4 segments. This track is a very sweet folk ballad coupled with incredible synthplay from Wakeman. I discovered the band with this track, and oh boy! Jon Anderson wrote this for his wife if I remember correctly, and this track just sweats love and sweetness. It also has a political meaning (Anderson originally called it the \u201cProtest song\u201d) that I\u2019m personally a bit insensitive to because I\u2019m overwhelmed by all this sweetness.Siberian Khatru - a 10 min uplifting piece. There is a bit less to be said about this track, as it is the only one which is not divided into segments. It might sound like a more ordinary track compared to the 2 others, and you might think album fatigue characterizes it. You couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. This track is awesome and very well made. The instrumental of this tune is very very interesting (pay attention to that bass!), plus it adds more energy after the sweet ballad you went through right before. I also gotta say it\u2019s the only track where a fading ending doesn\u2019t feel out of place. The fact that the ending is just a fade down feels 100% right, as the album started this way!A word also has to be said about the cover. Roger Dean, I think, really understood what the album is about. It\u2019s an apparently simplistic cover, yet you know every color change on this was thought about. It summarizes the main track very well - it\u2019s complex in apparence, yet the basis is in fact very simple. That\u2019s the strength of this album as a whole, the basis of each track is so simple, yet it would be nothing without the talent of the band. Anderson was on fire during those times. He\u2019s considered to be one of the worst lyricists ever in Rock music, yet I can tell you this guy paints with words. Every line has a meaning, and he arranged to write them so that his voice would be another instrument. His words fit the instrumentals very well, and his voice is another stellar component of what made Yes so great back then. This, and his concepts for the albums - \u201cTales From Topographic Oceans\u201d, \u201cRelayer\u201d and also his solo album \u201cOlias of Sunhillow\u201d - were great from a conceptual point of view. Thanks to him, the changes of line-up in Yes didn\u2019t feel out of place at all. But that\u2019s a story for another time! To sum up, this album is complete music-wise, and it\u2019s quite an accomplishment. I wouldn\u2019t recommend to go through it before going through \u201cFragile\u201d first, as the 1st listen to the main track can really feel weird, but definitely give it a go sometime. It\u2019s a shame Yes is less known today, because those guys really delivered, and for a long time!  ",
