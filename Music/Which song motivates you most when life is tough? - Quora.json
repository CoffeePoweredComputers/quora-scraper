(English song)Believer (English song)Stronger( What doesn't kill you) singer- Kelky ClarsonAashayen (Hindi song)Zinda hai toh ( Of farhan Akhtar)Dangal Dangal from movie - DangalExcept these songs the things which always helps me in motivation is trusting my lord. I don\u2019t believe in worshipping lord ( I don\u2019t do the diya , puja stuff) but I sit in my room alone and close my room for 15 minutes . In that time where there is complete silence I communicate with my lord . I know he knows what I am feeling right now. I meditate and ask him for suggestions / help me out . I cry and I tell every bit of what's hurting me , making me feel incompetent. I just sit there and remember until some positive vibes come inside me , until I feel the lord is alone but he never feels less he takes care of so many children. I am his child how can I be demotivated until I feel the path is difficult and is full of obstacles but what would be the feeling when I achieved it. and then I only think about the victory.And then I pray and Express gratitude to myself that I am lucky , good and I can achieve my goal. No one can stop me! I am motivated because I want to achieve something. I am motivated because I have a spark of dreaming. And I don't need anything to be motivated. Myself and my dream are my biggest motivation.And what else could be your biggest motivation if you don't even need any motivation. Yes !! Life is tough sometimes we feel to give up, we regret , we think neither anything is working out nor anything will be. But wait if I tried this hard for being on the track . I can't lose at this stage. I don't care about people/ objects/ places/tests who demotivated me they are scared if I achieved. I WILL SHOW EVERYONE WHO DEMOTIVATED ME . UNTIL THEY GOT MOTIVATION FROM ME.",
