            "answer_text": "In my opinion , I think : music videos are expensiveThey take up a lot of timeLet's take up slipknot for an example They are a very well known metal band , but they don't have many music videos . They stick to releasing an audio version instead . They have the funds for it but they choose not to , Because they are targeting fans who appreciate/ the music more than the video , and they'd rather spend that money on equipment and tours .but they also use a music video to send out a message or the vibe they are looking for . On the other hand let's take nicki minaj. Her image is more important as a celebrity , She is using her sex appeal as a way to market her music and meanwhile she is advertising things like beats pill or featuring other singers or musicians , and musicians like her usually release singles more than a full album so making a video for it won't ruin her time schedule . I hope I got my idea straight , because I can't really focus right now :) ",

            "answer_text": "Because for some music scenes it\u2019s not so important. In the Black Metal scene for example,in the beginning most bands of this genre didn\u2019t have the interest in making music videos. However they started to do it later,i think Mother North by Satyricon was the first Black Metal video ever (I\u2019m not sure). Back to the point,there are still a bunch of bands of this genre that don\u2019t want to make videos. And why? because it\u2019s not the main focus of this scene. And 60\u2019s/70\u2019s bands? Well,they didn\u2019t have music videos because it was very expensive for that time,it was a new thing. But i doesn\u2019t mean that music videos didn\u2019t exist on that time. People Are Strange by The Doors,for example,is a sort of 60\u2019s music video. ",
