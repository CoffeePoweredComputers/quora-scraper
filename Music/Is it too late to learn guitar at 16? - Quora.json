            "answer_text": "It's never too late to learn something new. Many guitarists don't begin playing until they are older. My son didn't begin to play until he tore the ligaments in his ankle racing motorcycles at VIR in Virginia. A racer in front of him slowed suddenly and he had to hit the edge of the course to avoid him. He wasn't allowed to walk on his ankle for 8 months. He had never played before but his dad had perfect pitch and played and wrote music on the guitar. I gave him one of his dad's guitars and it turned out he had inherited his talent and could learn to play a song if he heard it enough times. He used the internet and a of couple chord and basic music books to help learn. In 8 months he learned to play well. He was in his late 20s. But I've also known soldiers who didn't begin to learn to play guitar and bass guitar until they were sent on long deployments overseas. There's downtime sometimes and boredom sets in. For many it took hours and hours of practice, but they became accomplished musicians. Persistence and dedication can work as well as an inborn talent. Both my sons play now, but neither one picked up a guitar until after their father passed away and they were almost 30 years old. Maybe having such a talented dad discouraged them. I know they wish they'd started learning by 16, or 18 or 25. Malcolm Gladwell postulated that it takes 10,000 hours to master a subject. But with an instrument like guitar and all the access to free instruction on the internet, you can learn to play many songs relatively quickly. There are many songs that are fun to play that use only three chords. As you add new chords to your repertoire and master some strumming techniques, you will also get better at transitioning from one chord to the next. I didn't start learning until I was 60. I may not have 10,000 hours but I've been able to learn to play lots of songs, and it was my kids who gave me the idea that maybe I wasn't too old to begin to learn either. I wish their dad had been able to hear them play and they could have all played together, at least once. But knowing their dad didn't begin to play until he was in his 20s, and seeing how his mastery increased with the time he devoted to playing over the years while they were growing up, they knew it was a process that required dedication and practice. Even for a person who was born with an advantage like perfect pitch. There are many examples of musicians who took up instruments long after they were children, but this is my personal experience and in a way I think my sons used music to honor their dad's memory and fulfill a wish he'd always had, that they learn to play an instrument.

            "answer_text": "As other answers have stated already, no it is not too late by a long shot. I started at 21. I wanted to add a few words of encouragement to what has already been said. There was once a young man who dreamed of being a guitarist one day. In his early teenage years, he couldn't afford a guitar so he pretended to play on a broomstick. A the age of fifteen, he was given a beat-up second-hand ukulele that only had one string on it, and he loved it so much that he took it everywhere with him. It was not until his sixteenth birthday was approaching that he received his first playable instrument, but once he had it he barely put it down. He practiced obsessively and never quit experimenting with it. He got good enough to play backup for a couple other singers but remained relatively unknown. One day he was playing a small gig in a bar called the Caf\u00e9 Wha? when he was spotted by a musician who was looking to become a manager and within a year he was astonishing huge audiences. Sadly he died at the age of twenty-seven, but in the mere twelve years he spent playing, he became the greatest and most monumental virtuoso in the history of rock and roll.  So take it from Jimi, sixteen isn't too late to become an amazing guitarist. ",
