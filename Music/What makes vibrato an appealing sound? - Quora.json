            "answer_text": "I believe the fluctuation that it adds to each note makes each note sound with the warmth of the human voice.  Let's be honest folks, the human voice is incredibly effective at expressing emotion and conveying feeling. Unsurprisingly, all music (whether intentionally or unintentionally) tries to convey the same thing. Vibrato (a relatively modern invention) was invented to help bridge the difference! It works astoundingly well. If you listen carefully, you will notice that Baroque and Classical string pieces will never use vibrato, as they were more (not only!) focused on maintaining a harmonic purity. Vibrato was invented and pioneered in the late Classical and early Romantic period to break these 'invisible rules' and to also reinforce Romanticism's love of self expression. ",

            "answer_text": "Speaking as a physicist, a sound of fixed pitch when accompanied by other fixed pitches will go in and out of phase giving a low frequency amplitude modulation at the frequency difference. This is bothersome and sounds unnatural: the closer the match, the lower this warbling frequency. It could be as low as a fraction of a Hertz, going in and out of phase of periods of a few seconds. Vibrato gets around this. In effect, vibrato imposes its own warbling frequency at a natural-sounding frequency of a few Hertz. ",
