We take it in our stride. After all, thankfully, it's usually expressed (and taken) much more as a joke. Sadly and disappointingly, sometimes not. And, if not, this Roadie (which I reckon is the term you're after) won't be carrying that particular talent's instruments (and amps, and speakers, and cables, and lights, and stands, and PA, and drinks, and food, and, occasionally, drunk and stoned girlfriends, or rubber-legged boyfriends, or even the overly-medicated talent themselves!) ever again! However, these these days I'm usually amongst the alleged talent part of the equation. And, if anyone is kind enough to carry my gear (which happens occasionally), then I'll call them a bloody good mate, and buy them a beer or two along with dinner. ",
