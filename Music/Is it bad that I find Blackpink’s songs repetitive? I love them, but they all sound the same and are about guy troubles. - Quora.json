            "answer_text": "I certainly wouldn\u2019t hesitate to disagree. I think that because of the really long hiatuses they have been having and the long periods without comebacks are really taking away BlackPink\u2019s creativity and image. Mainly because they have only had 9 songs in the past 3 years (2016 - 2017 - 2018), we have really been tired of the same old songs that come on shuffle because a lot of us are just not into the music anymore because it doesn't feel as special. When BlackPink first debuted, they were THE TALK of the industry because their girl crush concept was so successful and they had such a bomb debut song along with very catchy songs, choreography, which were easy to sing along to and dance to. However, after those 4 songs, we got around 6 months of no activity, after which we got ONE (1) single which was As If It\u2019s Your Last. Which also did really well. After that - well Y'all know the story that we were dry as hell. We got a comeback after a year of waiting and what was the comeback you might ask? A mini album consisting of 4 songs which were recycled. I mean - a group having only 9 songs, and going on tour, obviously, people are going to get tired of the music and think its repetitive because BlackPink hasn\u2019t really experimented much with their music or lyrics at all. If Jennie starts writing lyrics for the BlackPink songs and adding more effort into the comebacks by participating or even all the members participating, it would certainly be better for them to experiment and see what types of songs do their fans like and it makes it more special to them. So no friend, you aren\u2019t alone - I think we all need something different from BlackPink that really shows their individual and group potential in which they actually shine with their positions.

            "answer_text": "Everybody has their own opinions, personally I somewhat agree with you, but I know a lot of other people who will fight you over this statement. I agree with you about the sound thing, but I feel it's more because that's their distinct style/sound. Kind of like how TWICE is (they're slightly more diverse in terms of sound, probably because they have more releases), but their songs, although sound similar, have this distinctness to them where you know it's a TWICE song. Plus you know, if it's working for them, then there's no reason to change just yet. Also, I think the whole boy troubles narrative is just what is typical to sing about in today's era of female pop music. Just like boy groups sing about girl troubles a lot. They do, however, have Boombayah, which is more about exuding confidence than complaining about boys. ",
