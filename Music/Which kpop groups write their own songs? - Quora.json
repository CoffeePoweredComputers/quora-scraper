            "answer_text": "Ateez- Hongjoong writes most of the songs, also Mingi writes as well (rap line). BTS- Pretty much everybody knows that rap line created BTS discography Namjoon is usually lyricist while both Yoon gi and J-Hope produce songs their songs are about life, youth, the situation in SK...soical topic most of the time. iKon-B.I write songs and he does it pretty damn good job. NCT- Taeyong and Mark write. The interesting topic just reread lyric of whiplash and then go to yestoday-it's actually unbelievable that Taeyong wrote both of these songs. I heard that Xiao Jun is a talented songwriter so I am looking forward to seeing his skills in WayV Seventeen- they are known as a self-producing band since not only they write their songs (Woozi, leader of the vocal unit most of the time) but they often choreograph themselves. Hip Hop unit is very talented I have to say Trauma is a masterpiece. Stray Kids-3RACHA (Chris, Changbin, and Jisung)writes everything. Their topics are same as BTS so not about romance rather about youth and their society very talented songwriters. Day6- Brian wrote pretty much all their songs and he is let me telly ou freaking amazing. Side notes: Chanyeol from Exo is a very talented songwriter and sometimes writes their songs also Lay writes his own songs. JB, BamBam, and Jinyoung all wrote songs for Got7 notable is their title track You Are written by JB There is probably more but I made a list of people I had on my mind right now. ",
