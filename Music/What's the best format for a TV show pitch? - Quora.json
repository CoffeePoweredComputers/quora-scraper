            "answer_text": "Best is a bit of a tricky word here. Pitching a show is the kind of thing where there are so many different ways to approach it depending on so many factors; and all of them have the potential to work. I can describe the format I use... but first, we should clarify what we mean by pitch. The vast majority of people who sell pitches to a network do this on the basis of a prepared oral presentation and nothing else. Of course, there are many exceptions but when people talk about the pitching season and selling a pitch during it, that usually does not involve a bible and almost never a written pilot. The reason it doesn't involve the script is that this is usually what you're pitching to do; to buy a pitch typically means to pay the writer to write the pilot for the show they pitched. And from those pilots, the network will pick some and produce the pilot episode. And of those produced episodes, the network will pick some to green light to series. So, in my experience, it almost always consists of an oral presentation that lasts about 15 to 20 minutes. I give an overview of the basic premise of the series, go into fairly detailed descriptions of the main characters, then pitch the pilot beat for beat, beginning to end, and then sometimes say a little about where the series might go over season one.  It may sound a little strange that so much of the sell gets narrowly focused on just the pilot but if you think about it, this is how it gets sold to the public. They announce a new show and try to get you to show up fro the pilot and more or less, the fate of the series will be determined by how many people watched the pilot and how well they liked it. So, if the pilot makes or breaks the show (more or less) to the public then maybe it makes more sense that the pilot makes or breaks the show to the network. ",
