            "answer_text": "Your best bet would be to go onto YouTube and type in movie genres using a hashtag. For example, try #ActionMovies or #Horror or #DocumentaryFilms or #ClassicMovies. Many of the movies are posted only until someone complains about copyright infringement, and then they're taken down. Sometimes you'll find that the person who posted the movie is trying to take extra precautionary measures to not get caught, so they might change the order of some of the film's scenes, or they'll name the film as \"(2015) Best Action Films\" or something along those lines. Usually there's a screenshot of the uploaded film that can give you a good idea of which film it is. And look at the length of the the video--if it's an hour and forty minutes, it's the whole movie. If its, say, four minutes, it's not--it's probably just an extended trailer. Quite honestly, I recommend spending the ten bucks a month and getting a subscription. Lots of services for streaming. Some are pay--Netflix or Amazon Prime or Hulu+ or Screambox or Crunchyroll--and some are free with commercials every 15 minutes, like Crackle or PopcornFlix or Plex or SnagFilms. PlutoTV is definitely an option, too--lots of channels to pick from and it's free.   Or, hey, better yet, go to the library. I went to the library a few weeks ago, and they had the Avengers movies, the Amazing Spiderman movies, lots of horror movies, action movies, dramas, documentaries and family films on dvd...and they can be checked out for a week at a time where I live. And, of course, there's Redbox.  Another thought: Check out the local pawn shop. It might sound crazy, but the Pawn America in my town has a bazillion blu-rays and most are priced between $4.99-6.99.

            "answer_text": "YouTube makes you pay to watch videos where the revenue from the payment is shared with the video owners like a fees paid to them for collaborating with YouTube. That is the sustainability model of YouTube Red as there is no advertising on those videos. How else will the creators be incentivised to produce new and original content time after time. So it is better to support original artists and pay up rather than expect to get a service without paying for it. ",
