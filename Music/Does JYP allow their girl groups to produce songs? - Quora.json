            "answer_text": "A production of a song has mainly three steps . These are 1. Songwriting 2. Composing 3.Arrangement . Songwriting is the skill that requires the least effort to learn among the three . In order to compose a song , one has to have knowledge about 3 to 7 various musical instruments in order to make beats or music accompanying the lyrics . A sound engineer is a person who will put the two together in a MIDI software for sequencing , arrangement etc . These last two skills take years of practice and skill in order to master . While songwriting is comparatively a fast skill . JYP boy groups like Stray kids are heavily involved in all three processes . Bang Chan is a certified producer right now having skill in all three fields. Other prominent members like Jisung and Changbin are composers and songwriters.  For GOT7 it's the same . JB is a certified record producer and almost all members have been involved in every EP and album . Especially Jackson Wang , Bambam and Jinyoung.  Another prominent group is Day6 and 2PM who all have contributed heavily in making their music . Day6 is a stand out as all songs have them contributing . For Twice and Itzy most members simply lack these skills of composing and arrangement . Twice have written about 30 to 35 of the 100 + songs that they have , a number much lower compared to the boy groups . The only member to have composed a song is Chaeyoung . Given except for Tzuyu all members have written songs . But that's not really producing a song , that's just writing it . Itzy haven't contributed to any of their songs yet .  Although Wonder Girls had a lot of producing done by Sunmi and other members , it was mainly in their later years . Same goes for Miss A. So the answer is yes . JYP does allow them but theyre not fully skilled yet . . At this point Chaeyoung seems to be prominent among them in composing . But girl groups also get a lot of care as they need to maintain a certain level of quality . So for every comeback new top tier producers are hired . For example for More and More , JYP had a huge array of producers  As you can see they participate in songwriting only . It's hard for members to contribute when so many top tier producers are already their to do the job . Any way in the future I hope they'll be able to contribute more and more . Peace. ",
