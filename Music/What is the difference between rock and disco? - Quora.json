            "answer_text": "Disco is an amalgamation of music styles that really existed in a short span of time (1975\u20131980) and is really a slicker presentation of rhythm & blues (R&B) with an emphasis on a straightforward dance beat. Mix in some funky synthesizer sounds, some sultry vocals (male or female, didn\u2019t really matter) and you are off to the disco races. Many bands flirted with disco and incorporated within their sound. My favorite way to showcase this is to use a rock band who was heavily criticized for putting out a disco track. Here\u2019s a comparison that shows the difference between \u201crock\u201d and \u201cdisco\u201d KISS - I Stole Your Love (1977)  KISS - I Was Made For Loving You  What\u2019s the real difference? The drumbeat and the synth instrumentation locked to the grid and a simplified musical structure would arguably be the hallmarks of the disco track, while a more aggressive tone and beat are the hallmarks of the rock song. Now, with that, a number of bands were associated with disco that perhaps really deserved to be categorized as funky R&B. One of my favorites is a little band called Switch. Here\u2019s a famous for its time track that I absolutely love to this day. Is it disco? Can\u2019t really say but I danced to it nonetheless (and before some of you scratch your heads about that, we had a disco in our town in 1979 that opened itself to younger kids on Saturday afternoons and I was a regular attendee ;) ). Switch - Best Beat in Town  ",

            "answer_text": "First off, there *is* no \u201cdisco music\u201d, it\u2019s R\u2019n\u2019B, a \u201cdisco\u201d is the place the music\u2019s played (a discotheque - but for the purpose, we\u2019ll use it as the term). now the differences are: \u201cDisco\u201d music is designed to make fill dance floors, make people feel sexy and sensual. Rock music is heavier music, based on the blues designed to make you dance but to lose the stress of the working week, usually from a live band RnB bands are live too but a different experience. ",
