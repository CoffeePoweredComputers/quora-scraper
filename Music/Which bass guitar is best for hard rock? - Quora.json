            "answer_text": "Tough question! What do the bassists in your favourite bands use ? Do you like their tone? Do you need to have 4 strings or more? The answers to these questions can be a good starting point. For me, I can give a couple of answers. In a 3 piece hard rock band I used to use a Rickenbacker 4001. This bass had the typical Ric \u2018clank\u2019 and it filled out a huge amount of space in the mix, especially when the guitarist was doing a solo or playing something in the higher register of his instrument. It had it\u2019s limitations, and it there were quite a few issues with keeping the bass in good working order (they are a pain to set up). Now I play in a 5 piece rock band and use a Fender Jazz Bass. The Jazz is my bass of choice for everything nowadays though so maybe me giving that asd a recommendation is a little biased. It cust through the mix nicely when needed and it can also sit deep in the mix filling out the low end when necessary. The neck is narrower in comparison to a lot of basses and this seems to suit how I play. I have had Stingrays that were great and also Precisions that I loved, I always come back to the Jazz Bass though. Enjoy! ",

            "answer_text": "Whichever one you like to play. I currently play a Fender Aerodyne PJ config. That gives me a pretty sweet range of tones to pick from. If I need a mellow warm tone, I\u2019ll up the volume on the P pickup, sweep the tonepot to reduce the highs, cut the highs and high mids on the amp, and pluck the strings closer to the P pickup. If I need an aggressive tone, I\u2019ll up the volum on the J pickup, and sweep the tone pot the other way, accentuate the highs using the EQ on the amp, and pluck the strings closer to the bridge. In the past, I\u2019ve played a Modulus Q5, Music Man Bongo 5, Spector Euro 4 (actually, a Euro 4, Euro 4 LX 35\u2033, and a Q4CRFM), Music Man Stingray w/ a Status carbon neck, and more. The Aerodyne is the only one of them I\u2019ve kept. I\u2019m of the opinion that most of the magic is in the pickup configuration, the preamp and the EQ of the amplifier. If you can tune what you have properly, you\u2019ll be alright. More than anything, your playing style and knowing your instrument is the key. Edit: I would have to add that in certain contexts, certain basses deliver a tone that can\u2019t be beat. Justin Chancellor (Tool) plays a Wal, which has a really specific tone. Flea (RHCP) usually plays either a Stingray or a Modulus Funk Unlimited, which is another example. I would love to own a Wal, but I just can\u2019t justify the cost. A Spector Euro 4 can come quite close, though\u2026 ",
