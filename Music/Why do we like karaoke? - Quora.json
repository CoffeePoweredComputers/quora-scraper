            "answer_text": "It\u2019s our chance for 5 minutes of fame. Also, music is a powerful force which can affect our moods, make us happy, sad, or experience a wave of other emotions. Singing is a natural process which has been drilled out of a lot of our heads because we\u2019re supposedly \u201cnot good enough\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s embarrassing\u201d. Karaoke is a way for each of us to experience something which is very natural without the stigmas that have been artificially imposed on us most of our lives. For me, I live to sing harmony. Blending two or more voices to create something that sounds awesome, that is more than any one person could create alone, is an experience akin to divine. Last night at my show I sang a duet with one of our bartenders - we did Bing Crosby\u2019s version of White Christmas. I\u2019d never sung that song with her before, but we\u2019re both good enough that we blended together like we\u2019d been practicing for a couple of weeks. I told the audience afterwards that we\u2019d practiced via e-mail, but afterwards with a smile she suggested that we should do it again tonight for the Friday crowd! ",

            "answer_text": "I think it\u2019s obvious. Everybody would love to be a singer but most of us suck at it because we lack vocal training. Karaoke makes everione equal because it is agreed upon that everyone will suck, and nobody makes a fool of themselves because we all get a turn to do it. The bad singing is ameiorated by the following: The loud pre-recorded band helps drown it out.BeerThe words rolling by, so you remember them and hopefully get the timing right.More beerThe knowledge that the next peson may be even worse than you.Pitchers of beer.When somebody who can actually hit the right notes gets up, they sound better than they are.It\u2019s a bit like driving a race car in a video game. You can crash 100 times, and nobody gets hurt.",
