            "answer_text": "Okay. So, by drum set, is that a shell pack (just the drums) or is it a fully stocked kit with hardware and cymbals? If it\u2019s a shell pack, you\u2019ve got more options. Let\u2019s also cover the fact that when it comes to buying drums, you need to consider a couple of things. First, you need to know your desired configuration. How many toms do you want? Do you want one rack tom and two floor toms or do you want 3 rack toms and one floor tom? Do you want two kick drums or just one? Don\u2019t forget about quality over quantity. Some kits like the Tama Superstar Hyperdrive are 8 piece kits, with two kick drums, three rack toms, two floor toms, and a snare. It\u2019s around $700 but from what I\u2019ve heard, they aren\u2019t the greatest. Now, is this your first kit or is it an upgrade? No matter the answer, you always have the option to search for used kits. This is something I highly suggest. Check eBay, Craigslist, Reverb, Guitar Center, and a bunch of different drum shops (Memphis Drum Shop, Dale\u2019s Drum Shop, Portsmouth Drum Center, etc.) for used kits. You can score on really great kits for cheap. This doesn\u2019t mean that buying a used kit automatically means losing quality, it just means that it isn\u2019t brand new. I got a Ludwig Centennial 4-piece shell pack (13\u2033 rack, 16\u2033 and 18\u2033 floors, 24\u2033 kick) in red sparkle for like $800. They are usually $1499. The person bought it, used it twice, and returned it. It was officially used. It sounds amazing. That was over two years ago. Everybody loves the feeling of opening up a box and getting a new kit. So, I\u2019m going to go ahead and answer your question about what are good kits. So, first off, stay away from OCDP. Their Venice series sounds like a cardboard box. But, some great kits are the PDP Concept Maple and Birch kits. They are 7 piece kits, three rack toms, two floor toms, kick, and snare. PDP is a DW owned brand, and DW makes arguably the best drums in the world. At around $850, you can\u2019t really go wrong with them. Pearl\u2019s Export series is also apparently really good for being a low-end kit. Casey Cooper, also known as Coop3rDrumm3r, is a YouTuber known for his drum covers as well as being the drum set drummer for the Georgia State University Marching Band. He uses a Pearl Export. Now he is an instructor for Drumeo, an online drumming school. These kits are around $600. Ludwig Signet is another decent line. They are around $900. I haven\u2019t heard much, but Ludwig has been dominating the drum set making industry since the beginning. I wouldn\u2019t doubt that a Ludwig kit would sound bad, as I\u2019ve played on a terrible tuned Accent (low-end) and it still sounded fine. Tama has great stuff in the Imperialstar, Superstar, and Starclassic lines. Superstar is the low-end and Starclassic is more along the lines of a mid-range. Starclassic can be anywhere from $800\u20131500 depending upon the sizes, configuration, finish, shell material, and purpose (study versus stage). I hoped this all helped. ",

            "answer_text": "Here's one I've been looking at:  Crush Drums \"Chameleon Ash.\"  It's still technically an up-and-coming company, but the drums sound phenomenal, and a five-piece kit will set you back around $999 US.  They have some great features, usually found on more expensive custom kits from other manufacturers.  Crush has been quietly (?) building up quite an artists' roster, as well. Crush Drums  Here's the Chameleon Ash in action:  ...and here's one of the Chameleon Birch kits in action:  Both kits come in around the same-ish price range.  Happy shopping! ",
