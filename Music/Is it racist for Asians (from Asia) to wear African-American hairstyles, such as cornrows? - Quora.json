Frankly, I don\u2019t want anyone utilizing aspects of my culture to look down on me or hate me because of something I can\u2019t control, go jump in a volcano. Otherwise, it\u2019s not inherently racist to adopt aspects of someone else\u2019s culture, and before anybody comes on here, yes cornrows are definitely a part of the African diaspora. Just because it looks similar to other cultures\u2019 hairstyles it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the same thing. Vikings, Native Americans, and the Chinese used a different method to create their \u201cbraids\u201d. Stone age paintings in the Sahara depict women wearing cornrows in 3000 B.C. A clay sculpture with cornrows is from the ancient Nok civilization of Nigeria, which may be as old as 500 B.C. Not to mention, if it\u2019s not an active part of your culture anymore, it\u2019s not a good practice to say it doesn\u2019t belong to a culture that practices it as a way of life. Any who, it depends on the intent of the person, if it\u2019s just because they like the hairstyle and think it\u2019s cool, I see no problem here. ",
