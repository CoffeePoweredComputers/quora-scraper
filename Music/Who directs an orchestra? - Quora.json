            "answer_text": "The person who conducts (or directs) the orchestra is usually called a \u201cconductor\u201d or \u201cdirector.\u201d Some people use the term \u201cmaestro,\u201d but that usually reserved for people with demonstrated mastery and experience (and usually used BY people who are trying to flatter the conductor or director). The type of people that become conductors varies, but they are usually musicians that have demonstrated a high degree of success on their own instrument(s), and have a specific interest in conducting an orchestra. Nowadays, there are actually conductors who specifically study to become a conductor, and have earned degrees in it from various colleges, universities, or conservatories, without necessarily making a name for themselves as performers, first. There is not one set path that leads to becoming a conductor. The job of the conductor actually very complicated, but a simple explanation is that they unite all the differing interpretations and points of view of the individual musicians into one coherent idea of how the piece should be played. There is a nice in-depth article on Wikipedia, HERE. There are books written about this, so it\u2019s not as easy an answer as these few paragraphs may make it seem! ",

            "answer_text": "Full orchestras have conductors, either guests or their music director. Smaller orchestras may have a conductor also, but some, such as the Orpheus chamber orchestra, rely on the concertmaster and some intense rehearsals and skillful coordinated playing. There have been some conductors, such as Bernstein, who have had such confidence in the orchestra they\u2019re leading, to start the piece and then watch as the music flows, stating that they know the piece after a couple hundred years (Vienna) than he did.
