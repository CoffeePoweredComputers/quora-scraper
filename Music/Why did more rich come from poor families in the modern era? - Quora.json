And when you are put in hell bent situations your brain will start filling you up with strategies to overcome it. People who are keen to change their life and implement the strategies only they are the ones to become rich in life. On the other hand when we are provided with every single desire of ours we tend to become lazy and clumsy.

And then the situation comes when all these wealth is going out of your hand, then the smart ones will think of situations to overcome it and atleast start working and a simpleton will simply get horrified and experience chaos and will end up empty handed.
