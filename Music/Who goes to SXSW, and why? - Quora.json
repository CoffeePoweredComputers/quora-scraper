            "answer_text": "In my humble opinion SXSW is one of the most interesting annual events at the intersection of technology, marketing, social change, innovation and much more. I\u2019ve been four times and plan to go again in the future. Who goes to SXSW? First, there are many parts to SXSW. It isn\u2019t a single festival but many festivals in one. What started as a music festival over 30 years again has grown into a different parts (that sometimes overlap) including Technology (called Interactive), Film, Gaming, and Comedy. There is also a relatively new SXSW EDU (education event) that usually takes place the week prior to the main SXSW event each year. Thus there isn\u2019t just one type of attendee at SXSW, but people and organizations go for many different reasons. Within each part of the festival there are also many subtracks and cross-cutting themes that often focus on innovation, the future of society, social change, ethics, media and more. Take a look the huge number of themes from the 2019 SXSW event below.  Why do people go to SXSW? I think there are five types of people/organizations who go to the event as I outline below. a) Thought Leaders and Innovators - Key influencers and innovators in all different sectors who go to connect, learn, close business deals, scale their companies and be part of shaping the future. SXSW is a great place to get a pulse of what are the trends of the future that are shaping society, business and culture today. b) Keeping it Weird - Austin is famous for a saying Keeping it Weird. SXSW has strong roots in being alternative, gathering all sorts of innovators, misfits, troublemakers and more. While the festival has gotten increasingly mainstream and has many traditional corporate partners these days, there is still a strong strain of this keep it weird in parts of the festival. This is true in some of the themes each year, participants, etc. c) To be Seen as Hip - Given the incredible convergence of arts, culture, and tech, many leading artists, companies and others go to SXSW to be connected to the hip factor. Many companies are present to market their goods to a well-connected and resourced crowd and be seen as innovators. d) The Dreamers - Dreams can be launched at SXSW. Many struggling artists, entrepreneurs, technologists and others attend SXSW with some hope of making the right connection, finding the right investor, getting the right press coverage to have their thing be the \u201cNext Big Thing\u201d e) The Curious - Lots of people go to SXSW not for a specific goal or reason but out of a sense of curiosity about the world, what is changing, where the opportunities and challenges, etc. I find going to SXSW for a few days to be one of the most mind-blowing, intellectually fun, engaging, meeting random new cool people and ideas experiences I\u2019ve been fortunate to have. I love attending a random combination of meetups, workshops, keynotes in totally different areas and always feel like when I leave SXSW I\u2019ve glimpsed some key trends shaping our future on the human, policy, business and societal levels. There are lots of other categories (and in practice most people or companies attend SXSW for a variety of reasons) that one could add to this list including the partiers (as there are a lot of parties for people who want that sort of thing), the consumers of media (not just the producers), etc. Hope to see you all at a future SXSW.

            "answer_text": "Wow, I don\u2019t know that I can top Craig Zelizer\u2019s answer, spot on. I\u2019ll give it a take though\u2026 This is my\u2026 13th, I think\u2026 time flies. I like to refer to the people who come to SXSW as Entrepreneurial Artists[1] Those who make the most of it have both skillsets. Sure, there are investors, founders, engineers, and run of the mill musicians, filmmakers, and storytellers; but it\u2019s the person fast on their feet, mobile, dynamic, and, well, entrepreneurial, who take best advantage of the tens of thousands of people to connect with and impact in just a few short days. And to have that impact, those who are creative, inspired, a little crazy, a just talented enough, the Artistic nature, who leave a mark. Why? Consider the convergence of culture and technology. Like nowhere else in the world, SXSW reflects what it really means to succeed in today\u2019s economy\u2026 the narrative with the innovation / the marketing and the technology / the story and the appeal. Whether one endeavors to start a company or shine in the spotlight as an artist, success today requires a measure of sophistication in both the tools and the market. That\u2019s what Interactive + Music + Film at SXSW represents; the creative class - the entrepreneurial artists.
