            "answer_text": "Because record labels have connections to a couple of things that indies don\u2019t necessarily have: Money. They can finance the production and distribution of the album. They have the money for billboards, ads, internet advertising, Youtube ads, etc. etc. etc. to get that band\u2019s music heard far and wide.Connections. Record labels have the IN with the radio industry to get a song/album into circulation/playlists on radios nationwide. Pay to play on the radio is still definitely a thing no matter what people say. Also, they have connections to other more famous acts that that smaller band can tour with. They have connections to more famous album producers who can take that song and make it more radio-friendly, give it a better hook/earworm and format the album so it\u2019s more cohesive and listenable all in one go.With that said, however, if the artist has genuine talent and a little money to put into promotion themselves and if they have their own connections to get their music on the radio (all of which Chance had) and they tour a lot, then they absolutely can achieve just as much success. You need three things: an agent (to book your shows), a manager (to manage your $, business affairs and help make decisions about everything) and a publicist (to promote you). With those three, you might be able to skip being part of a major label.Downsides of working with a label: all that money the label spends to put together your album and promote you? You pay it back to them through album sales. And you don\u2019t get a dime (unless it\u2019s also borrowed in the form of an advance) until after that debt is paid off.Second downside: That album you put together with them? They have the right to dump it and dump you, but ALSO forbid you from going to another label contractually. It\u2019s total BS, but it happens ALL THE TIME. Some young artist gets picked up, signs a contract and the label decides to pass on actually doing anything with them, thus leaving them in a legal limbo where they can\u2019t go anywhere else, but the label refuses to do anything with them. Like being locked in an apartment with an abusive ex who wont let you leave. Sound terrifying? You should be terrified. And THAT is why less and less artists are signing on to be record label pawns.Check out Jared Leto\u2019s documentary called \u201cArtifact\u201d about his band\u2019s fight with his label. Very eye opening.",

            "answer_text": "I believe musicians need to first have a\u2026. critical \u201cmass\u201d(in terms of popularity, revenue, self-promotions, music quality, etc) before a record deal can be even remotely advantageous for them. Ed Sheeran, JB, Taylor Swift, and so many other pop stars of today first got their popularity by themselves before they signed on to any label. So, I think in order to have any sort of deal with a label, you need to give them something, they need to benefit from it, and then they need to reciprocate the same courtesy to you. Pop stars who come and go fail to understand this are exploited by the label to the maximum extent and eventually become nobodies. A band is a business venture, no matter what way you look at it, and anyone who is even slightly successful will understand this. So to answer the question, musicians dont need a record label IF they are just starting out, hell, I wouldn\u2019t advise it at all. But the label still has a place in the industry for a semi-established artist, just don\u2019t look to a record deal to compensate your own lack of business skills with you band. ",
