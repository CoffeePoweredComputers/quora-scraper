            "answer_text": "I\u2019m slightly surprised that no-one has mentioned the obvious fact that a wooden reed absorbs moisture and this causes it to swell slightly and increase in mass, which has a dampening effects on some harmonics and higher frequencies. It \u201cwarms\u201d the sound. A synthetic reed doesn\u2019t absorb moisture (although it might coat the surface and get blown off in tiny drops) and this causes it to vibrate very differently because there\u2019s a completely different and far less even damping effect. The physics of materials is very important! Organics behave very differently - less consistently, but with more chance of finding an ideal that suits an individual\u2019s style and preference\u2026 variety is good, in musical terms. ",

            "answer_text": "Plastic reeds are notorious for playing out of tune. They do not produce a \u201ccharacteristic tone\u201d. They produce a tone, but not the one professionals recognize as the right sound. They are fine for amateurs or someone who does not play with other wind instruments. I use them for demonstrating instruments to my students, but I only do so once a year. Wooden reeds are too expensive to only use once. Wayne mentioned not needing to sand or balance, but I have never found a plastic reed out of the box that didn\u2019t need to be adjusted. Even many wooden reeds still need adjusting. ",
