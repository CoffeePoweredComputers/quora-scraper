            "answer_text": "The biggest supporter of Ellen is Portia de Rossi. She even made a hashtag for Ellen, #IStandWithEllen \u2014 sweet, isn\u2019t it? Also not very surprising, considering the fact that De Rossi is Ellen\u2019s wife. Gotta stand by your man or woman when times are tough. As for the other celebrities, some are supporting her fiercely, others are attacking her passionately\u2026  Those who support her, often face significant scorn and backlash for doing so.[1] The common argument is that they do not know how awful Ellen is to those who work below her, because she apparently is rather snobby and would only mistreat you if you are \u2018beneath her\u2019. Those on her level or higher up the Hollywood ladder would get treated with kindness and respect. The saying: \u201cNever bite the hand that feeds you\u201d, comes to mind.  At the end of the day, I don\u2019t know if Ellen Degeneres is a bad person or not \u2014 many people seem to have that experience, especially celebrities early on in their careers; those who already \u2018have it made\u2019, tend to be treated cordially and respectfully by her. Of course we cannot judge any book by its covers, and there has not been a lawsuit against her yet \u2014 just some \u2018internal investigations\u2019. With no \u2018hard evidence\u2019 either way, and only statements from disgruntled (former) employees and showbizz figures, I\u2019m not going to go \u2018cancel\u2019 the woman. That said, there are a LOT of accusations, and some come from highly credibly and respectable producers, actors and entertainment industry figures. Accusations and rumors of her bad behavior go back many years, so it\u2019s not an a case of an isolated incident. I\u2019ll just sit tight and see what else gets spilled. And I suppose, I\u2019ll just sip this tea a little longer! It does appear like she\u2019s rather snobby and not a very nice boss to work for, as most reports of her bad behavior come from on-set personnel and not from her fellow celebrities. As for the toxic workplace atmosphere\u2026 she acknowledges it, but places the blame elsewhere, with no reflection on her own behavior whatsoever.
