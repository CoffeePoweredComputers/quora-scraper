            "answer_text": "I get asked versions of this question on a semi-regular basis, so instead of dodging it (as I usually do), this time I'll give a few reasons why this question is so hard for me to answer.  I'm primarily a performing musician. I often rehearse and/or practice 5-6 hours a day, so I rarely listen to recorded music. It's not relaxing for me to listen to a recording. People ask about my Spotify or Pandora playlists---I don't have any. I do have an extensive CD collection, which I've acquired mostly for research purposes: how does so-and-so solve this problem? What is so-and-so's take on this piece? Did it change when s/he made a later recording? (See: Glenn Gould, complete Goldberg Variations, 1955 and 1981. Both are amazing recordings). [speaking of Glenn Gould, try to get your hands on his Solitude Trilogy, three sound documentaries that he made. Clearly waaaay ahead of his time.] Since I play concerts 3-4 nights a week, the performances I remember are live events, not recorded. For instance, if you asked me whose recording of Rite of Spring I recommend, I'd have no idea what to tell you. But my favorite performance of it was with Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos--it was hair-raising! Can you find an equal recording of it with him conducting? I don't know, because I don't know which orchestra(s) he's recorded it with, and I don't know what the chemistry was like between orchestra and conductor when they recorded it.  While preparing to give lectures, I often stock up on recordings (a different type of research). For one lecture my subject was Bach's St Matthew Passion. I made an astonishing discovery---Sir George Solti was an amazing Bach conductor. I had picked up an album of him conducting the major choruses from the work, and the Donner and Blitze chorus is mind-boggling (it comes right after the soprano/alto aria So ist mein Jesus nun gefangen). At the point when the chorus sings about the pit of hell, I felt like I was standing on the edge of the abyss. Would I buy his recording of the complete work? Perhaps, but I'd rather play it live with him, which sadly is no longer possible. (He conducted a memorable Firebird with us....or was it Petrushka?...)  I own a few \"sampler\" albums, and I've learned a lot from them. Phillips Classics pulled together Great Pianists of the 20th C, which opened my ears to a lot of artists I didn't know much about. (Ignaz Friedman, Edwin Fischer, etc). How I miss the days of browsing in a good record store..... Enough. But before I end I want to mention what I consider to be the most influential classical recording of all time: the original Fantasia movie. I can't tell you how many students and adults I've encountered throughout my life who credit their interest in classical music from having seen that film in their early years. ",
