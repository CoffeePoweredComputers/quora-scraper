            "answer_text": "Well there are numerous accounts of rock musicians living hard and surviving but truthfully I was not present for any of this, nor did/do I know anyone involved but have read an autobiography or two and well off we go\u2026.  To focus on one individual here I choose Mick Fleetwood as recently he was included in an answer of mine :-) What album cover has the most interesting story behind it? Notice the dangling balls at Fleetwood\u2019s crotch?? Ahh, cocaine makes for wise decisions in life ;-) But Mr Fleetwood has admitted in the past to having a tremendous cocaine habit/problem beginning back in the mid 1970\u2019s. Fleetwood Mac was a predominately blues band until a lineup change that brought Stevie Nicks and guitarist Lindsey Buckingham into the fold. The beginning of change. With the release of their new pop oriented album Fleetwood Mac recorded at Sound City in Los Angeles the group was introduced to cocaine in a very large way. According to Fleetwood, cocaine was dispensed freely at the studio as the drug was taking Los Angeles and other parts of the U.S.A by storm. The successful album had been fueled by heavy cocaine usage and by the time a second album was due the drug use grew substantially as the band attempted to recapture the creativity felt during the creation of the Fleetwood Mac album. A slippery cocaine covered slope for the band to negotiate and by the completion of the album Rumours things were taking a toll on the members of the group. Both married couples in the band, were dealing with failing marriages, drug use and the sudden fame they found. The beginning of the end. Fleetwood estimated at one point he consumed an average of an eighth of cocaine daily for roughly 20 years costing him millions. That easily qualifies as a serious drug problem. A sound engineer at the studio calculated that Fleetwood had snorted a line of cocaine stretching an astonishing 7 miles in length.  The band seriously considered thanking their drug dealer in the album credits which they were talked out of.. Cocaine was bought in bulk and Fleetwood was apparently the worst for both consumption and sharing the wealth.. Not suprisingly Fleetwood went bankrupt in 1984 an act repeated several times over the following years to come. Fleetwood has blamed his drug problems on L.S.D which a former band member consumed in an attempt to alleviate mental issues with Fleetwood participating. So despite fame and wealth, humans will be humans and battle humans issues regardless of status. So as always folks, learn from the examples set by others before us and those in the public eye. Life is an ever changing lesson, learn well.  ",

All those years of debauchery, drugs, alcohol and generally living the rock & roll life style to the full has taken its toll. For quite a few years now, they\u2019ve looked like they\u2019d been dug up from the family tomb and propped up for each appearance. I saw better looking corpses in the battle of Winterfell in the Long Night. Yet, in the last week they\u2019ve released their first single in years (which is quite good) and put in the best performance on the TV \u201cspectacular\u201d One World Together at Home. To be fair the bar was pretty low. And it\u2019s not 7 years since they put in the spellbinding Hyde Park concert. ",
