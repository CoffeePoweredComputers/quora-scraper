            "answer_text": "I\u2019m listening to this guy:  Popular music isn\u2019t doing it for me. In times of stress, disruption and disorder, you need someone who stared disorder in the face and said Na ja? Verfick dich blo\u00df! Ludwig van Beethoven lived through: losing his mother at 17 and becoming the family breadwinneran absent and hopelessly unreliable alcoholic fathergrowing deafness from his late twenties onwardsthe Napoleonic warsa profoundly unsatisfying romantic lifelosing his brother to TBa long illness which eventually killed him.He died during a thunderstorm, as if nature itself were worried that it was upstaging him. It started when I was working from home last week, enjoying the fact that I no longer had to listen to the regular office choice of BBC Radio 6\u2014nothing against Radio 6, but the same old songs get boring after a couple of weeks\u2019 rotation. I was in my living room, at my table, with my iPod in its dock, and it occurred to me that I\u2019d had all of Beethoven\u2019s symphonies on there for years but had only ever listened to Nos. 3, 5, 6, 7 and 9. So I started with No. 1. The only one left that I haven\u2019t listened to is No. 8, and while I must admit that I\u2019ve got them on while I\u2019m working rather than am listening to them properly, I figure that the first listening to any long piece of music is basically something you need to get over with: its real beauties don\u2019t become apparent till after a few listens. So now I\u2019m looking forward to a deep dive into the composer who, of all composers, is probably the most bracing. As the late Joe Kerman wrote in the New Grove article on Beethoven: [\u2026] Beethoven\u2019s attraction [for some musicians] rests on another aspect of the \u2018symphonic ideal\u2019, one that is less technical but probably no less essential. The combination of his musical dynamic, now extremely powerful, and extra-musical suggestions invests his pieces with an unmistakable ethical aura. Even [Donald] Tovey, the most zealous adherent of the \u2018pure music\u2019 position, was convinced that Beethoven\u2019s music was \u2018edifying\u2019. Maybe, just maybe, this will all issue in the fulfilment of my long-held ambition to write something about the work which, last summer, displaced the Ninth as, in my estimation, the single most brilliant, epoch-making and important piece of music Beethoven ever wrote: his Symphony No. 3. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m not going to have some spare time on my hands. In the meantime, it\u2019s been jazz, jazz-fusion, world music and the classics.
