            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not a huge Green Day fan. But Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt, Tre Cool have come a long way from the \u201988 punk rock scene in California. The song was overplayed. That doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t have significance. Beginners tried their luck on Guitar and collapsed after playing the first four bars of the song. The ones who stayed developed a good practice and kept improvising. This song came out in 2004. It was the eleventh track off off American Idiot. It does not go with the ballad of the Jesus of Suburbia as mentioned in the album. The song is much more personal for Billie. His father died of Stomach cancer on 1st September, 1982, when Billie was merely ten years old. He was too emotional during the funeral that he locked himself in his room. When his mother knocked, he would say, \u201cWake me up when September ends.\u201d And the rest is history.  Never give up. ",

            "answer_text": "When Billie Joe Armstrong was 10 years old, his father died of esophageal cancer. The date he died was September 1st 1982. The song is about grieving and loss. After his father's funeral, Billie cried, ran home and locked himself in his room. When his mother got home and knocked on the door to Billie's room, Billie simply said, \"Wake me up when September ends,\" hence the title. Think of it as that turn of the calendar page means that life goes on. Until then, it\u2019s frozen on the page that was there when the world fell apart. ",
