            "answer_text": "They are the most expensive of the widely available basses - I played one in San Diego that was $13,000, and Anthony Jackson's presentation model is $24,000!!! They are all impeccably made, no question there. I think that there are plenty of good reasons that the top players like Anthony Jackson, Victor Wooten, Oteil Burbridge and Janek Gwizdala are so excited about Fodera basses - you can order exactly what you want with precisely the tone woods you desire, and the execution will undoubtedly be flawless. That said, there's a lot of these questions about what's \"the best.\" Wrong question. The real issue is, what is the best for you and the style of music you want to play?  If I'm playing behind Rob Halford in Judas Priest, I don't think I want a Fodera with a coffee-table figured top and an ultra-high-end preamp, I want some massive wood and stanky overwound P-Bass pickups to drive the lower mids.  If I'm playing Motown music, I want a Fender Precision with tapewounds to give me that warm support to the rest of the band.  Playing salsa? That midrangey tone of Janek's would get utterly digested by all the timbales, congas, and bongos - that's why I'd bring my trusty Ampeg Baby Bass to thump out the booty and drive that dance floor.  Am I playing Celtic music behind fiddlers, bagpipers and bodhr\u00e1n? Then I want a nice woody sounding fretless to fill the midrange and low end with warmth and support the melody string players. Now, is the Fodera series the best for virtuoso players, especially those who need to get around the neck with melodies to contribute to improvised music like you'd hear in the Downtown Manhattan jazz scene? You could make an argument there. Hell, if you've got a five-digit sum hanging around burning a hole in your pocket, why not give it a shot? Just make sure to send us pictures. ",

            "answer_text": "I've played several Foderas including a couple Anthony Jackson \"presentation\" models (including an early double cutaway model)  A total of about 15 Foderas in both Canada and US,all 6 strings,varying from age and wood body/neck /pickup/preamp combos.... Yes they are good but worth the price? Sorry to say NO. And FYI,yes I CAN Afford them,I own a pro audio shop-so lets get THAT out the way REAL quick! Now my reason why- beyond the bank account,endorsements and NO kissing pro players asses like a teeenage groupie-the real truth You have to treat Fodera like Nike-sorry to say don't believe the hype-  especially there are now a few hundred custom builders around the world that actually follow the old world building master luthier craftsman techniques  INCLUDING the lesser known builders-that are pretty F**cking excellent including master builders from  old instrument building established EUROPEANcountries,Italy,France Spain etc... as well as classical double bass countries from the eastern bloc including Chec...etc also ( believe it or not),Russia. Travel and explore what is out there before you spend the $$$$ on a Fodera unless you just want one for show and to sell /trade- remember Fodera does not make its own pickups and preamps-even if they are custom spec-ed by Vinnie and Joe ( yes I met them as well, I was born in Brooklyn) their Bay Ridge factory is a popular hotspot for big names to visit. Joey was on my ass like a diaper to buy something when I went there,but I was not that impressed,I did a bit of travelling and know how far my dollar can go with \"bass competition\" out there and cannot easily be swayed. My point,the problem with the American consumer is that their \"vision\" of perfection becomes so easily influenced by ads,endorsements and \"names\" that the average person cannot think intelligently- Get my point? To give an example of my point,both Vinnie Fodera and Joey Lauricella like F Basses from Canada-which is not widely known (their endorsement) and F-Bass makes their own pickups and preamps.There is even a famous photo of F Bass man Furlinetto with the \"Fodera\" boys if you can find it The BEST is what you find that works for you-Not the price-time to grow up.
