            "answer_text": "spotify versus Soundcloud, a hot discussion this multi decade for audiophiles around the world \u2013 well, not any longer. We're here to settle this discussion for the last time!

            "answer_text": "LISTENERS According to their website, Spotify boasts 140 million active users and 40 million subscribers as of June 2017. They have the broadest reach, with users everywhere around the world and as diverse as Iceland, Lithuania, Nicaragua, Japan, and the United States. The NY Times reported that SoundCloud has over 175 million active listenersenjoying their services. What makes their pool of listeners unique is the fact that it\u2019s mainly comprised of fellow music makers and passionate fans from all over the world. While there is only a relatively small difference when it comes to numbers, we have to give this round to SoundCloud. ROUND 2: DISCOVERABILITY Daniel Elk, the enigmatic founder of Spotify, envisioned a more relaxed music streaming experience for their users through the algorithm which they call the lean back mechanism. Through this unique algorithm, users are given a unique playlist of music recommendations based on over 50 parameters \u2013 but there\u2019s no telling what these parameters are. This lack of transparency makes it hard to determine what you can do to better your ranking on Spotify. SoundCloud, on the other hand, bases a track\u2019s ranking on social signals and activity. The more people play, repost, and comment your tracks, the higher you rank. This makes you more discoverable regardless of offline popularity. ROUND 3: EARNING OPPORTUNITIES Recently, music streaming platforms like Spotify and SoundCloud have received backlash from artists and advocates who are protesting the awfully low royalty fees. The truth is, you can\u2019t make a sizeable income on streaming platforms with just a few thousand plays or listens. On average, an artist can earn only 15 \u2013 20 percent of the overall streaming revenue at most. ",
