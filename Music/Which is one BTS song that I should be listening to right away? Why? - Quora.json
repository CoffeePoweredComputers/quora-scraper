            "answer_text": "DDAENG  DDAENG is what your 2006 diss track playlist *wishes* it could be. Edgy, catchy, intelligent, DDAENG is everything. I wouldn\u2019t consider myself to be the world\u2019s *biggest* rap fan but boy oh boy does DDAENG hit the right nerve! I think you\u2019ll have a special appreciation for it if you can understand Korean/know a bit about Korean culture! I\u2019ve heard there is some clever wordplay and motif use! But it\u2019s still quite impactful even for a foreigner! The word \u201cDdaeng\u201d in and of itself doesn\u2019t have much meaning, but it\u2019s almost like a filler word for different situations. It could be the \u201cbuzzer\u201d sound \u201cddaeng\u201d when someone is saying your wrong. It could be like a Mic Drop \u201cboom\u201d moment. And it could be a few other things as well. But I think the chameleon-like attributes for ddaeng makes the song cooler and more unique! It also takes on a type of rap called \u201cstutter rap\u201d which can be seen in RM\u2019s verse. It\u2019s considered to be somewhat challenging from what I\u2019ve heard since you have to keep on beat. The lyrics are so cool! I think every verse is gonna hit people differently but a few of my favorites are: \u201c1\u20138, 1\u20133, 3\u20138, Ddaeng\u201dThe first part of the chorus says \u201c1\u20138, 1\u20133, 3\u20138, Ddaeng\u201d which is in reference to a well known Korean card game where a 3\u20138 card combination is superior which is just so cool in my opinion!Also soooo catchy!\u201cThis success, uhIs all thanks to you, uhIsn't it funny, isn't it funny? yeDon't you feel dumbfounded? yeTo be honest, think calmly, yeAbout why they, ye\nAre making such a fuss, ye\u201d\u201cNot enough time, yeThis is homework, homework, yeIf you can't solve this, then your problem is ddaeng\u201d\u201cThank you for ignoring us until nowThank you Stadium Dome BillboardThanks to you we became successful\u201d\u201cFriends from small companiesI hope you all become big soon\u201dThe members also seem to really love it! This clip is from their 5th Muster last year and even though the song is a rapline song (and also not on Spotify \ud83d\ude2d) all the members performed the song! (+Also rapper JK is back!)  DDAENG is my favorite hidden gem from BTS and I think everyone should give it a chance. If it's not for you that\u2019s okay too :) But it\u2019s definitely for me so I just had to share! ",
