            "answer_text": "A lot of people in Northeast Indian states such as Assam, Manipur, Nagaland and Mizoram are aware of K-pop. In regards to mainland India I\u2019m not sure but the number is growing. In general, Korean pop culture in the form of Korean dramas, K-fashion and K-pop have long enjoyed popularity in the Northeast since the early 2000s. The K-pop Contest in India is very popular and attracts many people of Northeast Indian origin and a growing number of mainland Indians as well. \u201cNortheast Is The Heart of The Korean Wave in India\u201d an article about the K-pop Contest in India. Pictured below are Northeast Indians who sing or dance to K-pop songs and have notable followings on social media.  Priyanka Mazumdar who is of Assamese descent releases covers of K-pop songs and has competed in many K-pop contests including the K-pop World Festival where she won the \u201cBest Vocal Award\u201d in 2016.  Edwin Jamir who is from Nagaland won K-pop Contest in 2013.  Dance Xenos are a dance group from Assam that dance to K-pop songs. They competed in the 2015 edition of K-pop Contest. In India, K-pop is gaining popularity outside of Northeast India. For example, according to this forum, BLACKPINK\u2019s latest single, \u201cAs If It\u2019s Your Last\u201d reached a peak of #10 on the iTunes Top 100 Indian singles charts. It\u2019s fair to say that it wasn\u2019t just Northeast Indian fans who helped the song attain that position. As a result, it shows that K-pop is gaining traction in other parts of India as well. ",
