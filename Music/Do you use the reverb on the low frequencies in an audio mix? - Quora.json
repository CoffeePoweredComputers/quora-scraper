            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t try to solve this with theory. Use your ears. Think about when and where you will hear bass frequencies with reverb and whether the atmosphere and emotion that creates is what you want in your mix. Here are few examples. An organ in a cathedral. Many cathedral organs have 32-foot or even 64-foot pipes that produce VERY low frequencies. You can actually hear the throbbing beats of the low-end harmonics, and the windows and other fixtures rattling. The reverb is immense. It's an impressive huge sound that overwhelms everything else. It\u2019s positively apocalyptic. Magnificent. Humbling. A celebratory cannon in an amphitheatre or castle courtyard. Wow, that percussive thud bounces around for ages. Makes you jump and cheer. Great effect\u2026 that\u2019s why they do it. Tubas and Basses in a concert hall. Somehow, they remain clearer than the cathedral organ\u2019s big pipes. The reverb is contained, even muted\u2026 because the concert hall is designed to reduce low-end reverb so the sound doesn\u2019t become confused and there\u2019s good clarity for every instrument. The first two are special effects. In the third, the reverb is controlled so it isn\u2019t causing a problem - because that\u2019s what low-end reverb usually does. In short, low-end reverb is a special effect, and should only be used like other special effects\u2026 in moderation. It can be VERY useful that way. The rest of the time, it\u2019s a good idea to use something like the \u201cAbbey Road Reverb\u201d trick, especially on vocals and drums.  When people with years of experience have found something that works superbly well, it\u2019s always worth starting there. ",

            "answer_text": "Be very careful is all I would say. Reverb is nice and could be used on low frequencies if you really want BUT you need to be very careful because these lower frequencies will produce heavy sounds and when reverb is added, those heavy sounds become prolonged and more muddy. Try and keep reverb fairly minimal. When mixing, you rarely use much reverb on the low, especially since it interferes with a lot of the frequencies, the most common technique is to keep the bass end clear and crisp so we can hear what's going on. Reverb also makes instruments sound further away in the mix, so you'll find that you lose some clarity in those bass frequencies - which is not good since humans generally find it harder to pick out the bass frequencies over high frequencies. A good track generally keeps reverb to subtle levels so the whole track isn't swimming in reverb - unless perhaps you are producing a psychedelic track.  ",

            "answer_text": "This is actually a really great question.  And the answer like most things to do with audio is \"it depends\".  As a rule. No, it is a bad idea.  When mixing something we all strive for is a tight, punchy, clear low end. You want to get a good interaction between the kick and the bass and you want to feel every bass note distinctly differently. Reverb does not help this, infact it makes the low end less clear, more \"muddy\".  However rules are meant to be broken.  Listen to a dub reggae record. The occasional kick drum hit will be drowned in reverb. It's a really cool effect.   Or what about a song that who's hook is a catchy bass line? You probably mix it higher than you would if it was just playing root notes, and things mixed loud tend to need a bit of reverb to make them \"glue\" with other instruments.  Also in heavy metal genres, there is often a super clicky kick drum. Here they often do use a bit of reverb on the kick drum so it sits in nicely with the snare.  So it's not an easy question to answer.  You are generally playing with fire by adding reverb to anything with low end. If you do and the mix is muddy, removing the reverb will probably help. But there are no rules in mixing. In the right song on the right sound it might sound amazing.  Use your ears, but go careful with this one.     ",

I like my bass lines generally an octave(or two) lower than most pop songs do, and so keeping the signal as monaural and tight as I can helps it from smearing. If I have a slow passage or a \"one hit\" sort of explosion, I will let the bass get in there sometimes, provided I turn down the early reflections. I usually don't use early reflections anyway since I never liked the sound. ",

            "answer_text": "Certainly, sometimes. Kick drums sound nice with some natural or processed reverb, for example. Some studios used to hang mics in a stairwell above a drumkit or even a speaker stack just for the natural reverb time it afforded. If it fits with the overall mix image, it's fine.  Reverb is most common on vocals to sweeten them and cover minor flaws. A completely dry vocal mic is a real challenge for the vocalist.  On the other hand, bass has such a reverberant sound in the studio that it's often unnecessary to add more (unless it's a very dead studio). ",
