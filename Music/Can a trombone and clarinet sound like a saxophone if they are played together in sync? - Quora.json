            "answer_text": "I was requested to try to answer this question. For the answer, I am assuming that a trombone and clarinet play the same exact note frequency-wise. From the top of my head, most brass instruments create something close to a sawtooth-shaped wave, while clarinets create a square-shaped wave. Saxophones at low volumes create something close to a sine-shaped wave, and as it gets louder, becomes closer to a triangle-shaped wave. With all three instruments (at least with the trombone and saxophone), the louder they are played, the more harmonics are created. I have trouble seeing a simple mixing through addition of a trombone and clarinet sound creating a saxophone-like sound. I don\u2019t think that it is possible, even with making very careful phase adjustments, to cause the right frequency cancelations to make a sawtooth wave and square wave come out sounding like a triangle wave, especially with higher harmonics. I suppose if one ran both sounds through a synthesizer sound algorithm that MULTIPLIED the sounds together, that with just the right manipulation, one can come up with something akin to a saxophone sound. If I am not mistaken, at least in THEORY, square waves have harmonics at odd multiples of the fundamental frequency. Ideal square waves have an infinite amount of multiple harmonics of the multiple frequency. Triangle waves are very similar to ideal square waves. However, the higher harmonics of a triangle wave roll off much faster than in a square wave. So, it SEEMS that to have any chance to accomplish what you want to do, one has to somehow START with the sound of a clarinet (square wave), and use the trombone sound (sawtooth) to REMOVE the higher harmonics of the clarinet sound, in order to come close to a saxophone sound. I think a lot of experimentation would be needed in order to find a way to do this, especially with messing with either phase cancelation, or algorithm sound multiplication (with digital filtering). LOL, there is the answer! Run a clarinet sound through a low pass filter that is designed to roll of the high frequencies linearly. Unfortunately in this case, you will not need the trombone at all, and he will just be a little less employed for your project. :-) ",

            "answer_text": "Kind of? Not really? Both the trombone and clarinet have a mellow depth to their timbre that is utterly lacking in the tenor saxophone (which is the most likely of the saxophones to be replaced by a trombone + clarinet combo given these instruments\u2019 respective ranges). If you want that depth, though, it\u2019s probably a good combination. For even more of that depth/richness, I\u2019d go French horn + clarinet or euphonium + clarinet. If the sound needs to be more nasal or reedy, any of those brass instruments + bassoon, English horn, or oboe (again, depending on the range you\u2019re trying to cover). Or if you have an alto sax but not a tenor, swap them in, an octave above if needed. Simply moving the entire tenor or alto sax line to the third clarinets will work too. ",

            "answer_text": "Not at all, not anywhere near the sound of a saxophone - it will sound like a trombone and a clarinet played together. The human ears/brain is very good at distinguishing between sounds - timbre, volume, direction, movement etc. Each instrument has it\u2019s unique timbre and each player has a way of expressing that to potentially get his or her unique tone. Some instruments are more expressive than others and the saxophone is one of them. ",

I might add that \u201csaxophone\u201d can refer to any of about a dozen instruments all of which sound somewhat different (I personally own and play nine different saxes: Eb sopranino, c soprano, Bb soprano, f mezzo, Eb alto, c melody, Bb tenor, Eb baritone and Bb bass saxes). In addition, any good player on any one of these can sound different to the next player. ",
