            "answer_text": "The process of producing a rap song can be a lengthy one. As a Audio Engineer, here is what I can tell you. Step 1: You must find a good producer. A rap song is not a song with out one. The producer is the one who will help fund the making of the song, as well as making the final decisions on how it will sound. These guys are masters in business and audio. Step Two: Find an Audio Engineer (in Rap terms, these are what you would consider a producer). The audio engineer, or for the sake of this answer, the \u201cproducer\u201d, is the one who will first of all make the beat for you and will later on finish mastering the song to make it sound as perfect and radio-ready as possible. These are the guys who not only know how to make good music, but also make it sound the best while doing it. I would suggest 2\u20133 \u201cproducers\u201d as they each can focus on a different area to expatiate the process. Step Three: Find a studio. This can both be a record label, and/or just a place to record the audio. Be prepared to either show off your skills, or pay a certain amount of money as these studios want to invest their time and space to something that is worth it. Your producer will be a tremendous help in the process of finding a studio. Step Four: Make the music. This is the point where your \u201cproducer\u201d should be making the beat. I would suggest sitting in their sessions to not only put your input on how the beat will sound, but to write. It\u2019s important to know how the beat will sound so that your flow and delivery can match that. Step Five: Record. This is pretty self explanatory, this is where you record the song for mastering. Depending on the song, this could take several day to complete. Step Six: Master. This is where you, the \u201cproducer\u201d and the Producer will get together to finish the song. They will be assembling the song, mastering the audio, adding effect and countless other things so that when it is passed on to be played, there are no flaws. Step Seven: Finished! At this point you should be finished. You will take the finished song and either hand it to a studio for approval, or publish the song yourself. If the studio rejects it, don\u2019t fret, just take their criticism and use it to improve the song for re-submission, or to keep in mind for you next song. Never let a song with good effort put into it go unplayed. ",

The Focusrite 2i2 starter package can be appealing if you don\u2019t want to pay for a professional, however; hiring an expert can help you in many ways. Vocal coaching, songwriting advice, high quality mixing and recording - all help improve your art as well as allow you to focus on the performance.If performing mumble rap, 100% time and pitch correct all vocals. This is done manually by hand - not automatically with autotune.record a music video, and invest in your image. People need to lock in a visual with your track - face tats, multi colored hair, etc. are good for shock factor.Take social media seriously, specifically with what you say and how you promote yourself to your target audienceRelease your track and get all your friends to share it along with all other people involved - which is why a well-known producer is a good ideaFollowing these steps are a good start, and will show people that you are taking your music seriously.",
