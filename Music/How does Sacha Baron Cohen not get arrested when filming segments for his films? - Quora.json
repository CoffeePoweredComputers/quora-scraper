            "answer_text": "Many of the things that people don't do, have no personal consequences if you actually do them. For example, if you don't get out of the way of an ambulance, you're not going to get cited -- the ambulance driver has more important things to worry about. People can \"get away\" with a lot more than they think they can; some of them would be bad (blocking an ambulance), and some are good (random street comedy). Some of the scenes in Sacha Baron Cohen's movies are not staged, and he has been sued for them (the guy he chased in the beginning of Borat for example), but most of what he does isn't illegal. Also, I don't suspect that when people throw chairs at homosexuals, the homosexual is the one inciting the riot. ",
