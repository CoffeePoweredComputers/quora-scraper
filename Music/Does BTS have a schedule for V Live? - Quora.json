            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think so. Clearly some members do more vlives than others. I think they have to show themselves from time to time but I don\u2019t think there\u2019re obligations regarding the lives. For example Jungkook doesn\u2019t seem to want to do solo lives anymore so he\u2019s not doing them. If the lives were scheduled we would\u2019ve had at least one solo live from him since last year but we didn\u2019t. So I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re pretty free in that department! ",
