            "answer_text": "You can't always do that, but android does allow you to move some applications to the SD card. You can do this by hand, or there are free utility programs that can either step you through the process or do it automatically. I am currently using Android 6.0.1. To do it by hand you go to the Applications Manager App under Settings, select the program you wish to move and the setting is under Storage. If you are given the option In the Stored In setting you will see a Change button. Clicking that button should present you with the option to move the app.  Keep in mind that not all applications are written in a way that allows them to be run from the SD card. The third party app I have been using lately is AppMgr III (App 2 SD, Hide and Freeze apps) - Apps on Google Play ",
