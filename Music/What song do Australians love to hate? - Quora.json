            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say for a lot of Australians the song we love to hate is that shitty national anthem of ours, Advance Australia Fair. It\u2019s supposed to uplift the nation but it\u2019s more akin to a dirge, it would sound right for a funeral procession, it\u2019s about as uplifting as a fart in a lift (elevator). The Pom\u2019s get the stirring tune of God Save the Queen with all its history and calls to King and country, the Yanks belt out The Star Spangled Banner and an amazing number of them know the lyrics. We in Australia rarely know more than the first verse of ours because the shitty tune and lyrics inspire nothing more than apathy and feelings of bewilderment. Why the fuck do we have such a cunt of a song for our national anthem? Check out the shitty lyrics here but if you\u2019re not up for a nap don\u2019t play this boring bloody song. God I hate it.  ",

It makes me cringe, surely we can come up something better than this hackneyed tuneless derivative non song. The French have La Marseillaise, the Americans have the Star Spangled Banner, the Russians have their State Anthem and we get .. THIS. ",
