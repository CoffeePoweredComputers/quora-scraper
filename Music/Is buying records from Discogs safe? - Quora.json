            "answer_text": "Firstly Discogs is a worldwide recognised fixed price selling platform for music. Secondly it does not allow the sale of illegal pressings or bootlegs unlike other platforms. Thirdly it operates a returns policy. Now for the downside, sellers do not necessarily quote shipping costs and occasionally I have ended up paying what I thought was too much. However if you contact the seller before purchasing like some people have done with my stock then the problem is resolved. In defence of the sellers being worldwide and selling different products of differing value and weight it is hard to give a comprehensive shipping price guide. I appreciate some buyers like photos of the product before committing, ask the seller for photos. As a private buyer and seller I will usually provide but sometimes it just pisses you off. Once, got four separate emails about one LP, selling price \u00a34.00, from the same guy. Ask all of the questions together. Another problem is the listings. They can be very complex so make sure you are buying the product you want. This confusion also applies to the sellers, I have advertised the wrong item twice, I think, totally unintentionally. However have purchased a lot of Beatles UK 45 pressings. at least 10 recently, that are wrongly listed. I just return them. ",

            "answer_text": "Mostly, yes. However, you might want to study the seller\u2019s rating and reviews before committing to a purchase. It will give you a better idea on the seller\u2019s reliability. As most record collectors can attest, one of the biggest concerns with purchasing via Discogs is the grading accuracy. They are on-point most of the time, but there was one seller who graded the record as VG+ when it was warped, scratched and barely playable. On the flip side, there are some sellers who go the extra mile as well, e.g. wet-cleaning the record before shipping, replacing worn inner sleeves, etc. It also helps if you start a conversation to manage your expectations. For instance, a Jap press might not necessarily come with the obi. Some sellers declare this up front, some don\u2019t. Good luck! ",
