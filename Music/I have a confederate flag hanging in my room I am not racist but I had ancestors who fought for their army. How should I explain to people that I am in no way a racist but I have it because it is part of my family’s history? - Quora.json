            "answer_text": "I too have ancestors that fought in the Confederate Army. I also have ancestors who served in the US Navy during the Civil War. Indeed, my US Navy ancestor, my great-great grandfather John Watters, commanded a river gunboat moving up the Mississippi to take New Orleans as part of Admiral Farragut\u2019s fleet, while another ancestor, my great-great-great grandfather Joseph Numa Augustin, as Commander of the Orleans Guard Regiment, was organizing the defense of New Orleans from that very same fleet. That Confederate ancestor was the child of a French man (Jean Augustin, my 4G grandfather) who owned a plantation and slaves in what is now Haiti. That Frenchman lost his plantation and had to flee the slave revolt that led to the creation of the nation of Haiti by 1805. The Confederate States of America was formed in order to preserve and continue the social and economic system of slave-based cash crop agriculture present in the primarily south and southeastern states of the US. Exactly the system that my 4G grandfather was a participant in, and my 3G grandfather joined the Confederate Army to defend. That 4G grandfather was not the only ancestor of mine who was a plantation and slave owner. The slaver culture that my ancestors participated in and defended was not merely an economic system for producing cash crops, as horrifically brutal as that system was. It was also a social institution of white supremacy. My ancestors believed that the proper and natural order of things is that white (men) rule and manage the affairs of the world, and that blacks\u2019 necessary and proper place in that world is servitude to whites. They believed that this social order was prescribed and encouraged by their Christian God. They believed that it was their God-given mission to \u201ccivilize\u201d the world on the terms of their social institution, and that such \u201ccivilization\u201d was a blessing to those they imposed it on. They did not just think this. They wrote speeches and books and \u201cscientific\u201d treatises about it. They constructed an entire legal system based upon it. They broke away from one nation state union to form another one where they could continue their way of life and their mission. A flag is a symbol. It symbolizes a set of ideas and an identity, which can be cultural, linguistic, or territorial. Usually it symbolizes some of all three of those things. The flag(s) of the Confederacy, including the flags of its Army and Navy, symbolize both the cultural(social and economic) and territorial ideas and identity of the Confederacy. They were created to symbolize that. A flag created at a point in time is inseparable from its creators and the events that led to its creation. If your Confederate flag happened to be an original one made in the 1860\u2019s, that a particular ancestor of yours has a unique connection to, and it has survived in your extended family as a memento/artifact through generations, and you happen to be the current preserver of those artifacts, that\u2019s one thing. My guess is that if the above is the case, you would not be hanging it on a wall in your room. It would be kept in some preservative container along with the other artifacts. If this were the case, then yes, you may be able to plausibly argue that it is part of your family\u2019s history and you are not a racist. But instead, it seems likely that your flag is one that you purchased, a replica made of modern materials. You chose to acquire this symbol, and to display it, apparently prominently, in a place where you will gaze upon it frequently. The ancestor who fought in the Confederate Army is your 3G, 4G grandfather? What else do you know about that ancestor, or your ancestors before and after him? Presumably, since he is your ancestor, he survived the war to have children, or he had at least one child sometime before he died if he did not survive it. The Confederate States of America existed for about four years, from 1861 to 1865. Your flag is a symbol created in that short span of time. But slaver culture existed in what became the Confederacy for many decades before the Confederacy itself existed. Four years is also a relatively short span in your ancestor\u2019s life, as it was in my ancestors\u2019 lives. Did your ancestor, like my 3G grandfather, enthusiastically volunteer because he believed in, supported, and benefitted from the social and economic institution of slavery and racist white supremacy, even if he himself did not own slaves or come from a family that did? Up front, the history makes it quite likely that he did. If you are not a racist (and a white supremacist) as you claim, then you reject the ideas and their expression in the social and economic systems that your ancestor was a part of, believed in and was willing to fight for, and if necessary, to die for. If you reject those ideas and their enabling systems, you also necessarily reject the flag that symbolizes them. That flag cannot plausibly symbolize anything else. If you reject the ideas and systems, and thus the ideas and beliefs of your ancestor, why are you prominently displaying the flag symbol of those rejected ideas as a means of memorializing your distant ancestor? There is no honor in fighting for dishonorable purposes, neither on your ancestor\u2019s part nor yours.  Commander John Watters, United States Navy. He fought for the honorable purpose of ending slavery and institutionalized white supremacy in North America. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: I have a confederate flag hanging in my room I am not racist but I had ancestors who fought for their army. How should I explain to people that I am in no way a racist but I have it because it is part of my family\u2019s history? The \u201cconfederate flag\u201d, which I suspect is the \u201cstainless banner\u201d rather than the national flag, is a complicated piece of symbolism. I assume this is what you have on your wall, right? With a symbol on a wall in plain view you won\u2019t get a chance to explain the \u2018why\u2019.  That flag was originally used by the Army of Northern Virginia. The army had other flags but this is the one most people remember. The CSA government later incorporated this symbol into the national flag, but it started with the Virginia army. So, without explanation to people visiting your room, you are displaying the flag of an army in rebellion to the current nation. Ignoring all other topics for a moment, you are showing support for an army that fought against the USA. Then, when you take into account that it was a rebellion and one of the central issues was the preservation and expansion of slavery your message becomes even darker. What happens when the descendant of slaves visits your room? How will that person take your message? I suspect it will be received as a threat. That symbol was also used after the war to intimidate and subjugate former slaves and their descendants. The symbol was taken from an army that fought to keep them property with no rights and was now being used to tell them they could not vote or use many public spaces with the people carrying the flag. Now, fast forward to the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s and it was again used to rally people who wanted to intimidate the descendants of slaves from having a voice in government, being allowed attend a school or hold public office. What message are you sending now? I\u2019m not trying to beat up on you. I\u2019m just trying to show you that symbols have different meanings to different people and, this one, has some really dark messages that are still felt today. You had ancestors who fought to the southern army? Okay, that\u2019s great. I mean that. Maybe consider a regimental flag. Or a modern state flag. Some other symbol that lets you show your pride without using a symbol that was - and is - used to intimidate and subjugate.  8th Arkansas Infantry Regiment  1st Missouri Cavalry Regiment  11th Mississippi Infantry Regiment  51st Virginia Infantry Regiment Some regiments used the stainless banner or part of it. I would hesitate to fly that unless you had some other images to quickly show you aren\u2019t promoting racism but, instead, are representing your ancestors. I\u2019m not exactly sure how to do that. It would definitely require some thought. One last thing, it\u2019s important to remember that any \u2018communication\u2019 has 2 sides: the sender and the receiver. Communication can be anything including words, song, email, flags, etc. The \u2018sender\u2019 (you) have an idea you want to share but that doesn\u2019t mean the \u2018receiver\u2019 (anyone else) will realize what you\u2019re trying to say. In fact, different people will get different messages. It\u2019s complex. But, with certain symbols, you really need to think about how it will be received. Asking your question shows me (at least) you are thinking about that message. Good luck. ",
