            "answer_text": "Although \"Our Era\" seems a bit vague to me, I would start off with a few musicians/bands that should have gained more popularity during their existence.  The first one on the list for me would be Nick Drake. The man was so underrated that this became a reason for his death. Yes, precisely. He hardly managed to sell his albums and his reluctance to perform live just contributed to the depression he faced. Ironically, he gained popularity exponentially after his death when his song Pink Moon got featured in one of the TV commercials.     The second one will undoubtedly be this American Progressive Masterpiece called Transatlantic. If we zoom into the bio of the band and focus on the individual minds contributing to this musical brilliance, we see names like Mike Portnoy (woooot?), Roine Stolt (founder of The Flower Kings), Daniel Gildenlow (vocalist of Pain of Salvation), Pete Trewavas (Marillion's bassist) and the mastermind and the biggest partner in crime - Neal Morse (From Spock's beard). I really won't say much about their music, all I would do is ask you to listen to the beginning of this track and wait for you to finish it.    For those in India, there is a news. Neal Morse band featuring Mike Portnoy will be headlining Mood Indigo 2013, IIT Bombay's Cultural Festival this December. Since they don't generally travel to this subcontinent, it is a good enough excuse to witness them live! The third one would be Glen Hansard. For all the Irish Rock lovers, if you haven't heard of him, here is someone who can rule your playlist for days starting from this:   He also appeared in a movie, Once, which featured his music and it was supposed to be one major step to showcase his music to a wider crowd but unfortunately, it didn't gain much popularity and Glen continued to be a musically amazing, yet underrated artist with the most charismatic voice of all times.

            "answer_text": "I'd suggest Bruce Cockburn He's a Canadian Folk/Rock musician who receives little attention outside his home country. He's been writing and recording great albums since 1970, has a fantastic voice and writes some brilliant lyrics. He writes social justice material based on first hand experience with the countries he writes about thanks to his tendency to actually visit the world's trouble spots. He is also a formidable guitarist whose skills are overlooked by many.  Check him out if you haven't heard him already. He deserves a lot more attention than he gets. ",
