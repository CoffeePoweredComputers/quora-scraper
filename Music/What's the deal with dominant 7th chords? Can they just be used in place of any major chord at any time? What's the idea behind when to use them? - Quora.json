            "answer_text": "I've heard people in some circles (often guitarists) use the term \u201cdominant 7th chords\u201d to refer to a major chord with a minor 7. An example would be the chord GBDF. If this is what you mean, then this will come up in blues, quite a lot. A major chord and a \u201cdominant 7th\u201d will be interchangeable. Outside of blues guitar, I don't think I've heard people use the term this way, and that seems to be true for a number of the other respondants here. In jazz and some other genres, your basic theory would suggest using \u201cmajor 7th\u201d chords for certain major chords. In the key of G, for example, you would have G Maj7 (GBDF#), C Maj7 (CEGB) and D7 (DF#AC). The last one you will recognize as a \u201cdominant 7th chord,\u201d because of the notes. Other people will recognize it as a dominant 7th chord for a different reason: D is the \u201cdominant\u201d degree of the scale. Part of the reason for this confusion comes from the fact that composers use \u201csecondary dominant chords.\u201d Suppose you have this progression: C Maj, F Maj, G7, A7, D Maj. It looks like it starts in C. A7 would not normally belong, but seems like it makes sense here. This is because the progression changed keys ( to the key of D major) partway through. This was facilitated by using the \u201csecondary dominant\u201d chord A7; within the key of D, A7 is a dominant chord. Now, you can also chain a whole series of secondary dominant chords together for a nice little progression: E7, A7, D7, G7, C7,\u2026 never really resolving the tension. Every chord is a major chord. At some point, you might get tired of this, and you'll get back to the beginning anyway after going through all 12 keys. Once you are bored, it's time to move on to tritone substitutions and extensions (9ths, 11ths, 13ths) and then you have drunk the jazz Koolaid. Welcome to the other side. ;) ",

            "answer_text": "A 7th Chord can be built on any note in the scale. Each note in the scale has a name. The first note is the Tonic. The second note is the Supertonic. I won\u2019t go through all of these - you can easily Google them. So you can in theory have a Tonic 7th, a Supertonic 7th and so on. Now, the 5th note of the scale is called the Dominant and like every other note you can have a 7th on this note too. The Dominant chord (with a 7th or without it) is very powerful because in Western music it creates the anticipation of returning to the Tonic (i.e. the key chord). Going from Dominant (5th note chord) to Tonic (1st Note chord) is a great way to end a passage but especially the whole piece itself. You can create this anticipation effect with or without using the 7th if you like - your choice - no rules on this. But if you decide to add the 7th it gives the harmony more of a definite finish. But again, it\u2019s all in your ear and what you want to achieve. So to answer the second part of your question, yes! You can have a 7th chord in place of any chord (even minor) at any time. (That\u2019s not necessarily a Dominant 7th though!). But be aware of how that 7th changes the sound of the chord - they sound slightly different to ordinary major or minor chords. The third part of the question: When to use them? Use them as the last but one chord of your piece and make the very last chord the key chord. That should sound great. ",
