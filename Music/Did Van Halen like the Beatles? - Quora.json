That being said, if that's what you were doing at that time then you damn well had better have had at least 2 or 3 beatle songs as well as at least 1 Chuck Berry song in your repitoure. I firmly believe that once you started looking at the beatles body of work, you would had to have developed an admiration and affection for their work. Did they like the Beatles? I truely don't know\u2026I am going to go out on limb and say yes they did like the Beatles!! ",
