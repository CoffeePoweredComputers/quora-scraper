            "answer_text": "There is no \u201cbest\u201d film scoring software. It depends on how you write music. Most DAW softwares (digital audio work station) available in the market today do almost the same thing. John Williams and Howard Shore write music with pencil on paper then transfer it to Finale or Sibelius. Hans Zimmer and Harry Gregson-Williams use piano roll on Cubase or Nuendo AR Rahman and David Newman use Logic pro The list goes on. My advice for you, Protools If you are recording a lot of live instrument and require very low latency compatibility with professional studios Logic Pro Very good Midi functionality Very good stock plugins very quick to use Abelton Live Electronic music Digital Performer Good MIDI functionality Top-notch scoring functions This is not an advertisement for any of the DAW softwares. There are others like Studio One, Reason, Bitwig Studio, Sonar. It all comes down to what makes you write music better. ",
