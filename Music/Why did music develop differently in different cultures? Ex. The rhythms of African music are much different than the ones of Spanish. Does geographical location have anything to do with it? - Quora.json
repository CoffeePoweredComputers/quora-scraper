            "answer_text": "Now this is a fascinating question. I don\u2019t know if we as a species know the answer to this yet - but I\u2019ll offer what I can. I remember when I visited Morocco, the part I enjoyed most was sitting in the bus watching the Atlas mountains roll by, listening to the radio with the bus driver. How incredible; this rhythm, this melancholy sound, traveled across the Atlantic to the Americas. Crashed into other forms of music; Irish, Central & South American folk musics; was recorded in the blues and rock and roll; and then bounced back over to west Africa. How amazing! I wonder how far back you\u2019d have to go in the history of that region to find someone who didn\u2019t recognize it. Did the Irish playing folk songs in Appalachia see something that looked like home in the rolling hills? Did the slaves, singing spirituals, care that the God they were singing to had a different name, or did they know that their voices would be heard nonetheless? The invention of tea was by accident - I wonder how many early musical instruments and ideas came by accident. Regional cuisines are often based in environment - what plants & animals grow, is it hot or cold, etc. - is the same true for music? We tend to see history as divided - Europe is over here, Africa is there - but of course in ancient times, there was a lot of travel, and intermarrying, and cultural collisions. Did Marco Polo bring pasta from China to Italy, or did they both invent it at different times? Are Spanish rhythms misremembered rhythms from Moorish settlers? Are they just different? What is it about seeing the Atlas Mountains in the distance, running along side forever, that inspires that slow, sad sound? ",
