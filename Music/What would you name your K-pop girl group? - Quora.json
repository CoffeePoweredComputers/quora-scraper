I was looking for galaxy names and this name popped up.WTF. This name will make people go \u201ctf\u2026?\u201d after hearing it and I think it is cool lol. Also, the band's name will be everywhere naturally. People use this term a lot haha. Its weird but good anyway. It may be an ancronym for What The Fudge or something else.Idk I think I should stop before I make a bigger fool of myself. I will add more if I come up with something more eligible and not so\u2026ahem. I think the best band and fandom names have already been taken, BTS and ARMY\u2661 FIGHTING! Ayo! I came back with more! The lame ones are made by me and others, I found on Quotev. Emblems. Emblems was one of the muses in Greek Mythology.Rose gold (by me). Because some people like simple and uncreative names. And also because I am lame.Neptune (by me). I don't know. I don't know myself, why I bother.gPOP (by me). It will stand for Girl Pop?Wonderland (by me). If the group debuts with a fantasy or unique concept. I tried.Okay, these are the good ones.

            "answer_text": "DREAMDAY (Hangul: \ub4dc\ub9bc\ub2e4\uc774); fandom name is OneDream. Because it means that DREAMDAY and the fans (Dreams) are One. Blue Sky (Hangul: \ube0c\ub8e8 \uc2a4\uac00\uc774); fandom name is MySky. Because they are what Blue Sky think of whenever they look up to the sky, their fans. Sunrise (Hangul: \uc190\ub9ac\uc2a4); fandom name Sunset. ORA (Hangul: none); fandom name Aura. Cos it sounds like ORA and gives ORA their \u2018aura\u2019 on stage. Lilies (Hangul: \ub9ac\ub9ac\uc2a4); fandom name Alstro. Because there\u2019s a type of lily (Peruvian lily) that means friendship and devotion, and it\u2019s scientific name is alstroemeria, so the first bit became the fandom name. Stargazer (Hangul: \uc2a4\ud0c0\uac1c\uc790); fandom name Pink. Because there\u2019s a lily called stargazer lily, and the pink version means prosperity. Pink is also the colour of hearts, and the sky (so, connects to stars) can become pink too. I hope this helped! What are you using this for? And also, any group that is actually named this, I apologise, I didn\u2019t know. I think these are all not taken. ",
