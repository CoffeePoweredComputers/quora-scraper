How I dealt with them is by convincing them that it is hampering my study .I requested them in a polite way that you must have consideration for others too . It would not affect your keen towards your music.I also somehow managed by considering him to play at the occasions and celebrations. THIS IS HOW I DEALT TO MY NEIGHBOR ADDICTED TO LOUD MUSIC. ",

            "answer_text": "You point super tweeters with sound playing at the 15.4-17 kHz range at very high output volumes. Try to hide the tweeters so they don't know from where exactly is this coming from. If you only activate this high frequency sound blaster whenever they start playing music they will think there is something wrong with their setup and stop playing it like that. You will be programming their brain to not do it. ",
