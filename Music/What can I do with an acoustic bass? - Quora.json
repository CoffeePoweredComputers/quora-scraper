            "answer_text": "acoustic bass guitar can be used to produce sounds that are so soothing to the human ear. Recently a guy named dmitry or something has created a beatiful andy mckee drifting solo by using an acoustic bass. Of course people who go with the majority can be seen that they take bass as a very unimportant instrument in a band which is kind of sad . So you already know the cliche answers you\u2019ll get like with an acoustic bass guitar you can do this , you can do that vagera vagera. But what you can do it try experimenting with it , try coming up with something new. Listen sometimes people get tired of listening to a good solo too no matter how good it is because it is too common . People want something fresh. Remember that Kurt Cobain also was an average guitar player but he had the guts to be unique . So i guess it is best if you can experiment with an acoustic bass by trying which no one has tried before . So be creative and get new ideas :) Cheers ",

            "answer_text": "The sky is the limit! You can sing and play your favorite tunes, it sounds great. Go for it! A few more ideas: Use a looper to loop sections of a song and then solo over them.Use a delay pedal to create a cool continuous sixteenth note effect. How this \u201chocket delay\u201d is done is explained here.You can also use the acoustic bass in a percussive way, hitting the body with your hands like a drum. And sing with that or play notes in between that to create the impression of a rhythm section.You can also run the signal through effects pedals like the TC Helicon and create harmonies. Loop that and create a solo over that.You can use a bow and play a beautiful ballad or a rock tune and play double stops (like power chords). Put on your distortion pedal and you are good!",
