            "answer_text": "My first guess was (and is) also Willie Nelson. Partially just because he\u2019s been around a good 40 years longer than most so he had a lot of extra time that others haven\u2019t. Same goes for Kristofferson. But there are people like Tom T. Hall, Bobby Bare, and Bill Anderson who were primarily prolific songwriters who also recorded occasionally, and when your job is \u201csongwriting, mostly\u201d, you tend to write a lot on a daily basis, assuming you still want an income, which wouldn\u2019t apply to Willie who also made a living performing. But you may have never heard their songs or they were \u201cfiller\u201d on an album somewhere. Shel Silverstein was a very prolific writer also, and crossed over into rock quite a bit as well (Dr. Hook). Something to ponder: Hank Williams (Sr.) churned out an amazing amount of songs in just 3 years so who knows what he could\u2019ve produced in a similar time (60 years, roughly). That\u2019s an interesting question regardless. ",

            "answer_text": "Who wrote the most #1 country songs? I don\u2019t believe there is a comprehensive list anywhere that would give you that information, if there is one I\u2019d love to see it! Pop music is a different story, and Lennon and McCartney top that list. Hopefully someone else will give a better answer but here is my take on it. There is a big difference between writing the songs and having them hit #1. George Strait has had the most #1 hits at 44 but he didn\u2019t write any of them, yes he writes but none of his songs reached #1, and none of his songwriters wrote more than just a few #1\u2019s each. While Dolly and Reba hold the record for females at 25 #1\u2019s each, they did not write very many of those #1\u2019s, Dolly I think wrote maybe four or five #1\u2019s. There was not a comprehensive Hot 100 Country song list until after 1958, before that there were three lists, one being \u201cMost played on Jukeboxes\u201d. So before 1958 I have to say the top contender is Hank Williams Sr. as he wrote the majority of his songs (but not all) that topped those charts. After 1958 Merle Haggard wrote many of his own #1 hits and is considered by most to be the best Country Songwriter of all time, followed closely by Willie Nelson, who being such a great writer, only a few of his songs reached #1.
