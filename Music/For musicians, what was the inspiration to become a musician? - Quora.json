            "answer_text": "Initially, for me music was just for fun only during my high school years and due to some healthy peer pressure from my other musician friends. Although I am not born in a musical family (my family can carry a tune but none of them plays an instrument), my encounter with several singers and musicians back in my school days managed to drag me to the joy of playing music. Determined, I eventually enrolled for some classical guitar and vocal classes back then, learning fundamentals for both instruments. I did not enjoy classical guitar, however, and dropped the instrument altogether for a while, but I continue singing and had fun doing it, and managed to perform repertoire consisting of songs by System Of A Down, Creed, Alter Bridge, and others. It was during my university years, however, when I eventually took music more seriously. I joined a band club in university that consisted of musicians of various levels, ranging from amateurs to professionals and semi-professionals, where I got accepted as a vocalist and at the same time obtained back my passion in guitar. It was also during this time that I discovered the magic of various bands and artists that will become my influences, such as The Beatles, Simon & Garfunkel, Cream, Queen, Elvis Presley, and others. However, although my skills were overall improved, I was not satisfied with my development, especially in singing. I found my voice quite nasal and vocal range limited, and what makes matters worse was that my friends convinced me that my natural range was low although the real issue here is a flawed technique. At the same time, as much as I enjoyed playing guitar, I hit a road block in chording and soloing, realizing that I have been stuck in playing the same patterns over and over.  Eventually, after I graduated from college and began working life, I decided to continue my musical activities in a community choir and also enrolled myself for a new set of guitar lessons in a music school. I really enjoy my choir experience up until this day especially since I manage to get know a literal lot of talented individuals that have possibly sung for their whole lives. My choir conductor is also a very good vocal coach and has successfully managed to expand my vocal range while maintaining a balanced and much more resonant tone. He also fed me with a lot of interval recognition and aural training that has managed to help me tackle more challenging repertoire much more easily. At the same time, my guitar teacher also managed to remove the dead end within my improvement by encouraging me to learn various chord voicings to make the music that I am playing a lot more interesting. From then on, I certainly know that I am on the right track, especially since I feel a lot happier playing music for my families, friends and loved ones, as well as knowing a lot of extremely talented and experienced musicians who are humble in sharing their knowledge to me. Overall, the journey has been extremely fun, and full of ups and downs, yet I feel much more alive than ever. The reasons that I have played music in the first place, i.e. to be able to feel that joy and share it to others around me, are still the same from my teenage days. ",

            "answer_text": "I was surrounded by music of varying genres at a young age. I began singing in church choir but when I was given the opportunity to learn an instrument in fifth grade, I took it because I wanted to learn a different side to music. I was then accepted into a performing arts middle school which gave me the opportunity to learn more about music, so I decided to take piano classes. (I would have started on piano if that had been an option in fifth grade.) Around this time I started coming up with little melodies but my school didn't have classes to take for composition. At my performing arts high school I was required to take theory and I enjoyed every minute of it. One day during the dinner break of a Saturday rehearsal, I was playing my rendition of Carol of the Bells, may I note that I hadn't began playing my real compositional part, and a \"friend\" told me it sucked. I had just listened to him play his renditions, that I didn't necessarily like, of several pop songs for about half an hour until he left to use the restroom. After he told me that my music sucked, I let him know my feelings towards his covers and he threw a temper tantrum. We were never friends again, but after that incident was when I first realized that composition was something I had a deep passion for. I then used a music notation software for the first time ever and thought that if I could compose music for the rest of my life that my life would be complete. I am now majoring in music composition at Loyola University New Orleans and there are quite a few people who believe that my music doesn't suck but that my music is pretty neat! ",

            "answer_text": "I'm not sure if this question is solely limited to professional musicians, but if it is, feel free to downvote. I'm a musician. I don't make a living at it like most of the responders do here, but I'm a musician all the same. I do perform with local theater companies and in my church as a solo performer.  I cannot remember a time when I wasn't doing something music related-I started piano instruction at age five. I learned to read music at the same time I learned to read.  My father was a classical pianist, and we had music in the family every day I can remember.  My dad would tell me that when I was a baby, he'd play a certain Chopin waltz, and it would make me cry. Don't know why, but I knew enough to know that THAT particular combination of sounds needed to be reacted to every time. As a child and a teen, I identified as a musician. My father was my primary teacher. Being a pianist was simply a part of what I was. Later on, as an adult, I started singing becuase I wanted more opportunities to engage in music. I wanted to be a professional, but I didn't have the confidence to think that I could actually make a living at it, so I studied engineering. I don't regret it. In fact, pursuing an alternative profession that pays well allows me to have the resources to pursue serious study. I currently take voice lessons with a private teacher, something that would be difficult to do if I didn't have a steady job that pays well.  I also don't have to worry about scrounging work to pay the rent-I have the luxury of choosing those productions/shows that I want to do, not taking opportunities that don't do anything for me. And dedication? Heh. YOU try going to work for eight-nine hours a day, and then going to rehearsal for a show for an additional 2-3 hours or more. AND finding time to practice/learn your music or dialogue on your own as well. Every show I do, there is at least one week where we rehearse until near midnight every day of that week before it launches, and I still have get up in the morning and go to work. And in many cases, we don't get paid for it, or when we do get a stipend, it covers maybe a tank of gas. We nonprofessionals have dedication up the wazoo. We do it for one reason-we love it. ",

            "answer_text": "For me, its all I ever wanted to do. When I was five years old, I had this book I used to write in. When my mom asked what I wanted to do when I got older, I always said, \u201cI am going to be a drummer when I\u2019m older\u201d not \u201cI want to be a drummer\u201d. There was nothing that came along between the ages of five and until my mom passed away when I was 16 that I wanted to do more than play the drums. On her deathbed, my mom told me to play the drums. So, my future was mapped out for me. I remember being in High School, meeting with counselors asking me what I was going to do for college. I told them, \u201c1. My dad doesn\u2019t have the money to pay for college, 2. I don\u2019t want to go to college and 3. I\u2019m going to play the drums.\u201d The counselors would tell me it wasn\u2019t an option, but I told them it was the only option I had. I didn\u2019t have any other options. It was do or die for me. My pops would always tell me to have plan-b and plan b was an escape plan. I started getting tattoos and what I called \u201cjob stoppers\u201d everywhere. I wanted tattoos and I knew it would prevent me from getting a normal job. I positioned myself with my back against the wall so I had no other choice than to do what I absolutely loved. I think sometimes you have to do that. If you love playing the guitar, you love rapping or you love producing music, you have to do it. That\u2019s it. Don\u2019t worry about driving a nice car, having nice clothes, or a nice place to live. Just concentrate on doing what you love and the good stuff will come. ",

            "answer_text": "I think my interest in music started when I was 7 years old. There was a popular cartoon that appeared at TV every day for several months, and I was watching it as I was a child. The background soundtrack was entirely classical music. I was born with synesthesia (an \u201dexaggerate\u201d connexion between different senses which allowed me to see surreal, epic worlds when I listened to music) so I started to wonder: \u201dHow can music do that! This is truly outstanding!\u201d. I would start composing music earlier, but I had no relative interested in music and as I used to keep many interests just for myself nobody noticed that I discovered something extraordinaty in music. When I was 11, I accidentally discovered a music software, a DAW: FL Studio, which is very well-known. I was good at computers and I learned to use them by myself in several months (this including more sophisticated things, such as Registry Editor, hidden settings, even creating harmful viruses!) so using a computer software for composing music became just natural for me. I was fascinated by FL Studio. I still remember my first piece, the summer I composed it... But the school began and I had a lot of work. I had no anymore time to discover the program. As usual, nobody noticed I like music, because I showed almost nobody what I am doing with the software. Everybody around me started to listen to awful contemporary hits, which used to give me serious headaches and made me feel very sick (my synesthesia showed me nothing for these songs, just a void dark space). I somehow managed to compose something a bit classical (the genre I liked then), and I was so fascinated about it that I told myself that I must continue (it was not a very complex song, but it was the best I have composed at that time). I unfortunately gave up on FL Studio when the \u201dreal\u201d schoolwork came and I had to participate to contests, Olympiads, to work on class projects and so on, but at the end of the sixth grade, I started writing books, and I was always imagining that there were movies based on them, so someone had to compose soundtracks for them. It soon began too hard to explain everything I was feeling by writing, so I had to find a new, more expressive way - again, I had to compose music. When I was 13, I started using FL Studio again (my synesthesia evolved a lot and allowed me even to \u201dlive\u201d in the worlds the music created for me, to feel the moods in there) and I also discovered some useful plugins and sound libraries to help me compose (the software has some in-built plugins and electronic sounds, but their quality is not really the best). At 14 years old, I started using it intensively, and I managed to create some of my best electronic tracks. This summer, at 15 years old, I almost completely changed my stile and started treating the DAW as a \u201dprofessionist\u201d (I started using the mastering utilities, the hidden sound editors and so on). I even got a soundtrack request for a small project. During all this time, I never knew any music theory at all! And, most important, I never gave up on originality and I am still against the generic, common sound patterns we can hear everywhere around and tell almost nothing. I am still listening to classical music and I deeply respect it as my first journey to the wonderful, complex world of music.

            "answer_text": "I think I had a feeling I would go into music all my life. When I was little, I wanted instruments, and wanted to be a rockstar, and a bluegrass fiddler, and \u201cJanis-Joplin-if-she-were-a-nine-year-old-boy-and-also-not-dead\u201d (Nine year old me had high hopes for us) My great-uncle bought me a harmonica at age six, and I still have it, and play it (well, I play my newer harps more- that one was run over by a truck a few times and it\u2019s a miracle it still plays decently. Not pushing my luck) I stumbled across a notation editor back in high school that changed my life, though. Myriad Music Maker. I think I tripped past it looking up the Vocaloid software, after an online friend introduced me to that whole can of worms. Up until that point, I knew I enjoyed music, but I didn\u2019t think I could make music. I still have my first compositions, saved on my old desktop back home. I may have even uploaded them somewhere, I can\u2019t remember. They were chaotic and quirky, and lack all conceived notions of western tonal harmony- I was just bashing away at my computer keyboard until cool things happened. I didn\u2019t even know what scales were, or what that funky 4 on top of another 4 meant. But I kept at it, and later came upon Finale 2010, then Finale 2012, then Finale 2014, and before my laptop keeled over and died, I\u2019d upgraded to the latest version, Finale 25. I have a big portfolio of compositions now. But none of that would have happened, beyond those first four pieces, had I not been friends with a percussionist and a bass clarinetist in my high school\u2019s band. They wanted me to join band so they could hang out with me more, and also because the band was getting smaller and needed more people. I said maybe, if I had time. They offered me three tangerines- one from each of them, and the bass clarinetist grabbed an extra from someone who didn\u2019t have a need for citrusy bribery. I decided, with further introspection and a growling stomach, that I did, in fact, have time. The rest was history. I joined band, got slapped onto drumline, considering my considerable lack of experience playing any other band instrument (I was informed in short order that harmonica and Guitar Hero guitar were not appropriate band instruments.) I got a glockenspiel for my sixteenth birthday, joined the jazz band when my first band director left, and the new one started teaching jazz, playing harmonica. I only had a C harp, though- eventually, I got a Bb too, but after a few weeks, my band director suggested maybe I try playing xylophone. I was reluctant at first, because I had no idea how to improvise on xylophone- harmonica, I had learned by ear, improvising was easy (and wowed the judges at Elon Jazz Festival- they definitely didn\u2019t expect a harmonica solo on \u201cChameleon.\u201d) But, I gave it a try, and fell in love. Later that year, he let me try out some marimba mallets he had, and I found a set that sounded great on our old clunky xylo. I started using those in jazz band, and it sounded a lot better. I fell head over heels for the vibraphone when I first laid eyes on one in person, on stage at Elon Jazz Festival- students were using the other two, so I didn\u2019t get to warm-up or rehearse on it before we went on, so it was my very first time playing. Lot of fun. That spring, I was selected to apply for NC Governor\u2019s School, and the moment of truth came- I could either audition for the Music program, or send in a portfolio for the Art program (at the time, I was debating between majoring in Music or Visual Arts, in college.) I ended up going with music, and proceeded to absolutely bomb my audition. I had no idea how to play timpani, and the best I could do on snare drum was haphazardly improvise what sounded like a marching cadence. I also brought a two-mallet solo (Gossec\u2019s \u201cGavotte\u201d) for marimba, an instrument I\u2019d only played twice before (I had to go to Oxford, NC for lessons at a guy\u2019s house. My school didn\u2019t have one.) The guy conducting the audition liked my choice of music, because he liked the Looney Tunes. He did not like the fact that I had memorized the piece, but only as a whole, and definitely not the measure numbers. He also didn\u2019t care for the fact that I only brought one copy of the score, and when he asked for specific measure numbers, I had to walk over to him and check, over his shoulder. It was a good learning experience, though! My teacher brought his vibes all the way from Michigan, my senior year. I claimed them as my own, and only I, and my designated prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, were allowed to play them. Nobody contested that, because I was the only senior percussionist, and also the only one who knew how to play keyboard instruments at all. I ended up teaching everyone else, but the vibes were mine. I auditioned that year for Brevard College, and learned from my first audition- I brought in four solo pieces and an improvisation on \u201cBag\u2019s Groove,\u201d for vibes. I was only supposed to bring in something for snare, and something for marimba. Nailed it. Once there, I took the Music Education path, which was a good decision because at the end of my sophomore year, they dropped their Music Performance degree (to all of the Music Performance majors\u2019 vast outrage.) Also a good decision because my high school band director showed me that I wanted to teach music. And now I\u2019m here. Giving a senior recital next spring, just played a junior recital this past spring. Pieces I\u2019ve composed and arranged have been played in front of an audience. A musician\u2019s journey. My life. ",

            "answer_text": "My father was a successful musical theater composer, which was pretty much the start of everything. It's the reason there was a piano in my house, and the reason I thought of \"musician\" as something you could do and still be a respectable human being. For most of my friends, the choice to become a musician was in some sense an act of rebellion that it wasn't for me. My dad told me a few months ago that \"if you'd wanted to be a doctor or a lawyer I would have been fine with it, but deep down I would have been a little disappointed.\" Around the time I could walk, I started playing the piano for fun. I wasn't taking lessons yet, but I'd climb up on the bench, and I figured out how to make major chords, and play them in parallel. I got piano lessons, I played for a while, and then started composing. I didn't want my dad to know about the composing and give me a hard time, so I did it mostly in secret, but by the time I was graduating from high school I had shown him some of my stuff, made recordings, etc. I went to college hoping to double-major in music and math, because math was what I did well in school, and music was what I did well out of school. In my first couple years of college, I took some pretty hard/time-consuming math, and enjoyed it, but I just remember this irrepressible feeling that it was taking time away from my real life. Music never felt like that, for me. I'd pull an all-nighter working on music and the next morning I'd crave sleep; I'd pull an all-nighter working on math and the next morning I'd crave vacation. This isn't a good reason to become a musician. Nor is the ever-popular \"I couldn't do anything else\" (if you really have no other skills/interests, you're probably a pretty terrible musician). In my case , there were two moments of inspiration to become a musician: the first is the one mentioned above, when I started hanging out at the piano as a little kid. This moment gets a lot of credit from a lot of musicians, but it doesn't seem like the real one to me. For me, there was a second moment that came mid-way through college. I was taking this music class with a famous musicologist, and we needed to memorize pieces for a needle-drop test. One of the pieces on the list was Wotan's Farewell, from the end of Wagner's \"Die Walk\u00fcre.\" My dad had hated Wagner because of the antisemitism, so I'd never heard it before, and I needed to listen over and over again, so I could get this music through my thick skull.   George London singing it, basically rocking out. The music was absolutely astonishing to me, and I remember thinking that I would be willing to work harder than any other person on earth to be able to make these sounds. Being a musician is hard, and if you're not willing to do more for it than for anything else, you haven't yet been inspired to become a professional musician. At that point, I'd been saying I wanted to become a musician for a couple decades, but that was the moment I actually decided to work hard enough to ensure that it'd happen. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a hard time calling it \u201cinspiration.\u201d In some ways what led me to music was, and still is, a bit of a curse. A wonderful, maddening curse. There is always music in my head. Always. Sometimes it is something I heard recently, sometimes it is something I have never heard before. It has been that way since I can remember. Sometimes I even dream something that has been stuck in my head all day. This is what I refer to as part A of the curse. The worst is when it\u2019s a song that you know that you know, but you can\u2019t figure out what it is. I\u2019ve had that going on for the last three days now. I don\u2019t think I heard it anywhere, since it\u2019s an old and somewhat obscure song. It seems to have just showed up out of the blue. I know this song, and I\u2019m pretty sure I used to own the record. But what is it? Who is the artist? What is the title? It\u2019s instrumental, so there are no lyrics to search to try to figure it out. It is driving me positively crazy!! So that is part A of the curse \u2014 the constant music in my head. Part B of the curse is that, for me, there\u2019s really no such thing as \u201cbackground music.\u201d If what is going on outside my head is drowning out what is going on inside my head, I\u2019m still not at peace because it is virtually impossible for me to hear music without analyzing it. What instruments are involved in this piece? What is the time signature. That\u2019s an interesting drum beat \u2014 just what is that drummer doing there? I can\u2019t quite resolve that odd chord progression, what the heck is that? Then there is the double-whammy, which has been happening the last few days with that song that is stuck in my head. Not only can I not figure out what it is, I cannot stop analyzing it either!! It is extremely distracting. My wife keeps asking me, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d or, \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d, or simply, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d I try to explain that there\u2019s a song in my head and I\u2019m trying to figure it out. She says, \u201cOh I know. I hear Christmas music everywhere.\u201d No, dear, you don\u2019t know. You remember Christmas music that you heard somewhere. This is different. So back to \u201cinspiration.\u201d I was not inspired to become a musician, I was driven to it. I had to pick up a guitar and learn to play it so I could try to share with others the stuff that was inside my head that didn\u2019t originate from outside my head!! Ironically, to learn the guitar I practiced by playing along to stuff from outside my head so I could figure out how to play the stuff that was inside my head that didn\u2019t originate from outside my head. Confused yet? Imagine me back then!! I hear things so precisely in my head that I learned to play everything by ear. I learned to read music so that I could talk about it properly with other people, but I have never learned a song from sheet music or tab. Everything is by ear. Once in a while if I think that a fingering that I am using is particularly awkward I will look at the tab to see if there\u2019s something else I could do, but about half of the time I end up rejecting it because it doesn\u2019t sound quite right to me. Oh, BTW, in case anyone is unaware, when you have a song stuck in your head and you can\u2019t get it out, do you know what that is called? It\u2019s called an earworm. Honest. Look it up! I guess I have chronic earworm syndrome. (O_o) ",

            "answer_text": "It's not like we musicians suddenly get inspired by a movie and grab a guitar or something. We are born with the talent and it wants to get out, it's like an instinct we cannot control. Even if we didn't have our instruments, we would do finger drumming to any song, fantasize detailed guitar solo's in our head even on the crappiest pop song and enjoy singing along anything singable. It's something that we are born with, not something attained later. I started playing the piano when I was 9, and I started because I wanted to start not because my parents wanted or something. I grew up listening to Ray Charles and Blues Brother's, and I was absolutely amazed by the joy and energy of their music. Unlike other kids who enjoyed playing outside, I would sit and listen to blues albums for hours, with closed eyes, and would imagine the scene. My parents were no musicians, I didn't have any role model to be inspired from. It's just that I enjoyed listening to music much more than playing ball outside in the dirt or riding bicycles or climbing trees or lego's or whatever. Nothing amused me more than that. And when I found an old toy keyboard in the cellar, it immediately became my favorite toy. I even composed something and showed it to my father. He was very excited, so I started taking piano lessons. Soon, I would spend hours playing piano everyday, improvise, discover, try everything I can after or before I finished my classical piano exercises. After 2 years, I performed a classical piano song on the school's end-of-the-year talent show where kids of my age (11) would perform their talents in front of their teachers and parents, and that was the irreversible moment in my life when my talent was publicly noticed and my self confidence was boosted more than ever. Just 2 years after that, I sang my first song as a lead singer, and was very well received. In high school I was even more appreciated and won many prizes in musical competitions and performed in many places with my band. And in college, I performed over 200 gigs with a professional band and even released an album, started composing full-band rock songs, recording, editing, mixing, mastering, writing lyrics, jingles, and much more. So basically most musicians don't get inspired by anything. They are born with the talent, and when they get in touch with music even in the simplest form of \"listening\", their talent gets triggered to burst out. And only once after they are appreciated, it becomes an irreversible passion for life-time. ",

            "answer_text": "I think I decided to become a musician when I heard our family friend, Stacy Orico, on the radio. I remember being in my dad\u2019s baby blue Buick Lasaber, driving on the freeway in our little country town and her song came on the radio\u2026all the way out there. She was only fourteen at the. The second I heard her I was like, \u201cwhoa-whoa-whoa-what-what?!\u201d We only get about six radio stations out there so it was a huge deal so when that happened, something clicked in my head and I knew I wanted to do something great. If my friend, who was as human as I was, could do it and figure out a way to travel the world and sing her songs, then I could too. Maybe it was foolish pride at play, but when you\u2019re a kid you think anything is possible.  At that point in my life, I had a real passion for music and I loved singing. I had always done music with my family and started kind of writing songs and singing songs at social gatherings just to get attention. Truth is, I\u2019ve been an attention whore my entire life. I would perform Green Day songs in front of my classmates to get girls\u2019 attention, but then I realized there was something much bigger that I could do.  Because my parents didn\u2019t raise me listening to soul and r&b, I did my research. A friend introduced me to Stevie Wonder\u2019s music and something happened inside me where I knew I had found the music I was going to make. It made me melt and it continues to make me feel alive when I listen to it. That\u2019s not to say I don\u2019t like other genres of music, I love a lot of different types, but there was just something about soul and r&b. I can\u2019t explain it fully. A few months later, I was introduced to Stevie Wonder, Donny Hathaway and Aretha Franklin and it was all down hill from there. I was sold. ",

            "answer_text": "I'd say there's some genetic aspect to it, as my father was musically inclined, so I naturally picked up guitar playing from him. He would play and sing his old time country music but I was too cool for that, growing up in the sixties. So, I held an interest in playing guitar but not singing, too shy I guess, from an early age and somewhere along the line in my youth I got a guitar of my own, which was about the only thing my father and I seemed to have in common. Long story short, I ended up being a better guitarist than him but really too shy to do anything serious with it. I had some professional musical ambitions but would have needed to meet the right people to truly follow that path. I met some interesting musical people, but not the right ones. The genetic component to musicality doesn't of course tell the whole story. What's going on inside, what's the inspiration? I have, at least from the time I was about ten as I remember, always loved what struck me as good music and I wasn't really caught in any particular category. Could've been anything that caught my ear. What really jump started my lifelong musical affection was, like so many others of my time, The Beatles. I have vivid memories of their first appearance in America on the Ed Sullivan tv show and like many kids back then the experience of that phenomenon and all of the Beatlemania to follow left its indelible impression on me and probably left me somewhat useless for other interests. I was hooked, but only took music amatuerly seriously, as I had girls and school and other growing up pressures to deal with. Looking back I know I could only have gone more serious with music if I'd had a suitable cohort for such an off the beaten path life adventure. Still, as a listener and lifetime music connoisseur, I can say that something about the experience of what I consider to be the best of musical offerings has definitely illuminated my inner world and I truly believe helped me to be a better person for it. For me, and I suspect most other serious music listeners, the highest musical expressions have a truly transcendent quality to them that can take the respective listener to mental planes that might be otherwise inaccessible. What I consider \u2018good' music will definitely exercise one's imagination and all this is the key I think to why anyone would be inspired to play other people's music and even create their own unique musical landscapes.

The Beatles were exploding during my young years and I ate that stuff up. At a very young age someone gave me a big hardbound book with The Songs of Lennon and McCartney. That was it for me. Of course there's the whole \"to get girls\" angle but that has more to do with why I decided to perform music. Deep down I don't perform music for other people. I play it because it's inside me and it needs to come out. It's like meditation and therapy for me. Sometimes I play soft and melodic. Sometimes I play loud and angry. Sometimes I play well, sometimes badly. Music is the one constant in my life. Everything else changes. Music persists. Here we are in 2015 (almost) and I still listen to The Beatles along with everything from Mozart to Charli XCX. Then I pick up my Tele. ",

            "answer_text": "Music is a really demanding career and you have to be really motivated and disciplined to be able to succeed at it-- and even then, there are no guarantees. Given that, really the only reason to do it is if you can't stand *not* doing it. Growing up, I had a lot of hobbies and academic interests, and I still do; but one year I went the whole summer without singing or practicing piano, and honestly got kind of depressed. When I picked them back up again in the fall, it was really cathartic and I realized how important music was to my emotional health. I just really need that meditative state that the deep focus of a practice session gives, in order to stay sane. I don't think musicians are necessarily \"inspired\" to make a go at being a professional-- it's a serious decision like any other career would be. I could have kept music as a hobby and done something else instead, but the right doors opened at the right time, and I ended up doing music. ",

My parents were both visual artists who were also good at music in their own way, so there was always music around even when I was a baby. As a child I told my dad I was going to be a composer. At school my singing brought the other kids to tears. I saw a movie once where a beautiful lady calmed an entire crowd that was about to riot, by just singing and then asking them to let her sleep in peace. That really stayed with me, even though I don\u2019t remember the rest of the movie at all. So I always knew. But when I was about 12 I thought music wouldn\u2019t be practical for making a living, and my voice dropped to mezzo which was a huge disappointment to me, so I considered several other careers. I did an initial study of a few different things that looked interesting but nothing except music held my interest for longer than 3 months. At 13 I dedicated to music. It\u2019s been a weird road, but I am and always will be a musician. ",

            "answer_text": "Started as a guitar player, I thought it would be so cool to play in a band as a guitar player. Making solos and going crazy on stage, I loved the image of that. The crowd cheering while you play it and the adrenaline going into you and it becomes intense. I played guitar for a couple of years but soon became bored of it because I didn't think it was fun, I didn't like that fact the guitarist just stood on stage and moved their finger only. I soon became interested in bass, I saw one of my favorite bands bass player and he was just moving to the rhythm and I loved it! I thought the bass player felt the music a lot more than the guitarist (not true I know). I wanted to become a bass player and I knew I could because it isn't a whole lot different than the guitar, but I did soon realize it took more strength in the fingers. This didn't bother me but it did, I have long fingers and honestly ugly crooked ones. I just couldn't press my fingers in a whole lot to make the sounds I wanted to but it soon got easier, although I kept getting better I realized that I still didn't like doing this, I wasn't as interested as I am today. I found it way to complicated for my head and wasn't as much fun as drumming. Yes I became a drummer and for the first time in my life I have found out what I want to do for the rest of my life and that is drumming. My guitar teacher was the one who got me into drumming in the first place ironically. He pushed me to be better and I ended becoming really good after 7 months. I had realized that drumming interests me so much, I love the various amounts of cymbal sounds, the options you have of drums and how to form your kit and the different styles you can play for different genres. My inspiration was Tomas Haake, I though the polyrhythms were crazy and I though that they sounded perfect, soon Danny Carey became my inpiration. After I found Danny Carey I saw how much creativity goes into music and how much effort it takes to make something sound good like that. Point is, being creative is a big inpiration, making your own unique sounds and beats to a song and reaching mastery level. Comparing a beginner drummer to an expert one pleasures me. ",

Kinda the \"lead singer\" in her church choir, my dad LIKES playing the drums (but really, he can't xD), my brother shreds the guitar, and my dad would play and / or talk about music non-stop. That last one is the strongest. It really depends on the person, but I think people really need to be pulled into what they're listening to. If they aspire to be a guitar player, then while listening to songs, they feel something once they here it. Same with bass players, drummers, singers, and so on. When you truly feel that amazing, bizzare feeling in your chest and stomach when listening to your favorite song, possibly balling your eyes out (totally me every day XD), then you're inspired and in love. I want to be where 5FDP and KoRn are, and I'm not nearly 1/100 as good as my brother. And he isn't nearly 1/100 as good as them. Well.. Probably..  But guess what? Music is inspiring me to keep going.  ..SO YEAH. ",

            "answer_text": "My dad was an audiophile and every Sunday, back in the 60\u2019s, he would turn on his stereo equipment and played all kinds of music; Classical, Soundtracks, Big Band, Jazz, Popular Latin American music, etc. I was just 5 years old back then but, I still remember vividly that whenever my father played the Theme from Exodus soundtrack, I would run outside and looked at the sky while I heard the music. It was so grand and magnanimous that seeing the immense blue skies was the only equivalent to listening to that masterpiece. Soon I realized music was a trigger to my sensibility, that I naturally understood music theory (not writing or reading music, but the math in music, the relationship between notes, the significance of intervals, time, etc). And music became my world since then. At 9 fell in love with the drums, and my father bought me a semi-pro drum set (not a toy at all). At 11 I started to learn bass. At 15 I was already an accomplished drummer and bassist playing gigs here and there (hiding my age). By then I also started learning the guitar, first in an acoustic guitar, then switched to the electric guitar, then a Puerto Rican instrument called the cuatro. After that I expanded my percussion instruments to include timbales, congas, bongos, clave, guiros, the works. Soon came the piano, flute, and saxophone. As with percussion, I expanded my interest in strings by learning how to play the tiple, bordonua, ukulele, mandolin, bandurria and other instruments. As you can see, learning a new instrument was just a new challenge I enjoyed. ",

I'm not sure there was a time that I \"became\" a musician. In fact, I never thought of myself as a musician until recently. But I always was. Some people are comfortable with money. Others express themselves with visual images. Music has always been what is at my core. I used to sing, all the time. People would ask me why I'm so happy. What a strange question! Singing has nothing to do with being happy, or sad. It is simply my language.  Inspiration? I didn't have any inspiration to become a musician. There have been moments when music has revealed great beauty to me, unlocked sadness, enabled me to feel the warmth of connection and the depth of loneliness. Yet, there was never any point when I could have said \"that's what I want to be\" or \"that's not me.\" ",

My cousin then brought me to a music store (at the age of 5), and bought me my first drum. By 7 years old I was already a professional musician performing with bands. Another blessing I got was the middle and high schools I attended. Both of them were musical and academic at the same time. In the mornings we had the normal classes such as math, reading, etc. but in the afternoons from 1-6 pm we had Harmony, ear training, applied piano, applied instrument, band, solfege, forms and analysis, theory and counterpoint. By the time I graduated from high school we graduated with two diplomas, one in general education and the other one in music. I've been in music since then and continue today as a band leader, arranger, composer, vocalist and percussionist of my on Salsa band in San Diego. I've produced 2 cds, and I am currently working on 2 more productions, on on a Bomba y Plena cd dedicated to my uncle and a Salsa CD dedicated to my father. About my style of music? Because I traveled pretty much around the world with the US Navy Band, my music is a fusion of Classical, Salsa, Merengue, Afro-Cuban/Caribbean and Jazz.  I see myself performing until I am 99 years old and loving every minute of it! ",

I think I've always been a musician.  When I was five, my parents had two odd grownups come over and test me to see if I could play music, which was absurd. They stretched my fingers out and measured, had me raise different fingers; I didn't know what they were looking for, but I sure didn't have big hands or any particular coordination. They were from the music store, looking for customers. I went through all sorts of music lessons on accordion, piano, and guitar and one year I got a new teacher. He was a \"semi-retired\" jazz sax player. He taught me how to improvise and it was those first few solos I took that told me I was a musician. We would play jazz standards and \"trade eights.\" When I wanted to play Beatle songs, he let me. By then I was playing with my friends who had guitars and eventually a band was formed and it just went from there. I have never regretted anything I skipped out on over music. I'll thank the memory of that sax man forever. ",

Perfect pitch, ability to play a song right now that I heard when I was ten, never seeing the music, have not heard it since that time, never played it back in the day. If you mean become a professional musician, I weighed a few choices: Chemist, Accountant or Musician. Musician won. Not by inspiration, by pure desire to do something that fit my nature better, based on a logical choice that it was more \u2018inevitable\u2019 than the other choices. I have been INSPIRED by great musicians. Leonard Bernstein, Claude Debussy, Janis Joplin, Paul McCartney, Art Tatum, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Antonio Carlos Jobim, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "I didn't care about music at all before college.  I took a couple violin lessons, I think, in junior high, but I hated it and my parents didn't force it on me.  I listened to popular music in the 80s, but didn't collect anything, really. But in college I took a required Humanities course with a music history portion and, wow... Suddenly I couldn't get enough of the stuff.  I was buying every album I could get my hands on, studying music history... I was insatiable. But it didn't translate to wanting to play music.  I had been writing song lyrics, but more as a side effect of trying to be a writer in general-- I didn't think songwriting was something to focus on.   One Christmas I was broke, so I got a couple friends together to record a Capella X-mas tunes to send out as gifts.  Afterward we decided to take a crack at writing and recording songs together, and they came out better than any of us would've expected.   We then went our separate ways-- one guy became a doctor, another guy became an administrator for Doctors Without Borders... And I decided to pursue being a musician.  What else could I do? ",

            "answer_text": "For musicians, what was the inspiration to become a musician? I was inspired to play guitar when I was around 12 years old, but didn\u2019t actually pick one up until I was 14. My parents were too poor to buy me one. My inspiration for wanting to play/create music was my brother. He wasn\u2019t a musician, but I remember him playing his 8 track (yes, I\u2019m getting old) of AC/DC. The sound of the guitars had me \u201cThunderstruck\u201d, if you will. I finally got a used guitar when I was 14 from a friend. It had only the 1st and 2nd strings on it. Believe it or not I actually started to learn melodies with only those two strings. I was very inspired to be a musician when I first heard Claude Debussy\u2019s songs, \u201cClaire De Lune\u201d and \u201cThe Girl with the Flaxen Hair\u201d. I\u2019m not sure why, but Debussy\u2019s music hit a nerve in me. I wanted to be able to capture human emotion in my music like Debussy. I\u2019m no professional musician. I have created a few songs that have been recorded. I never really set out to become a professional musician. Music was more of an escape for me, growing up in a very volatile home I needed a way to deal with it all. Music really did save my life. Instead of going out with my buddies and getting in trouble, I elected to stay home and play guitar. ",

Not bragging here - I\u2019m lucky and I\u2019m cursed - most folks can\u2019t hear the difference, but a drummer who can\u2019t swing drives me *nuts*!

So we collected records, compared artists and tunes - it became an obsession to many of my peers - and then one day, we said \u201clet\u2019s form a band\u201d - and I\u2019ve been gigging ever since.

I saw the bass, and I felt like we had something in common...it was tall like me! A few years later, I got a bass guitar for christmas. Two friends had guitars and another had drums. We started a band, and once covered a Metallica song for the pizza guy. I was only really into rock and roll (for listening), but I played every chance I could. I was in the Orchestra, Jazz Band, the previously-mentioned rock band, Concert Band (trombone), and Choir.  When I was 16, our High School Jazz Band was touring the elementary schools to get kids interested in music. We played, the Percussion Ensemble played, and at my old elementary school, a cellist (who was the other student in my lessons as that tall 9-year-old) performed a solo.  As I said, until this point, I was only really interested in rock music, but during her solo, something \"clicked.\" That's the only way I can describe it. It was a change that happened inside me in a split second, and I thought to myself - \"This is what I want to do for the rest of my life.\"  ",

The feeling of waiting for the work day to be over so I could get back to being myself was almost unbearable. I might as well have been in prison for eight hours each day. I also felt I was betraying the good people I was working with; people who liked the job and wanted to do it well. It felt rude to be there. Moments of action upon true inspiration are rarely profound, or even enjoyable. Usually, it's just a case of, \"Well, fuck it.\" (Pardon the profanity, but those are the only words that have ever occurred to me when confronted by destiny.) ",

My role model was actually Mark Hoppus (the bassist/lower voiced singer in Blink 182), so I was interested in learning bass guitar and singing.I started out learning only the bass, a friend of mine who taught me how to read Tablature, and started getting better at singing later.Not too long after that, I taught myself guitar and got tons of experience singing.Now singing is my absolute favorite thing to do and guitar is 2nd to that. Inspiration is definitely something that keeps coming, in tons of different ways, as you grow as a musician. ",

So she gave us an option to go play in the pool or play in her class(piano). Everybody left. I stayed caused i was really frightened of her.But that choice is one of my best ever. Cause i grew older, music became a really important factor in my life. I loved playing the piano. i was getting really good at it. I feel really good to listen to me play... but the real joy is to be able to make somebody else happy with my playing.My buddies, today who chose to go swim, hear me play today, and wish they had stayed back to.My inspiration was.... fear that eventually turned into a love and passion.

They sounded so good to me but at the same time frustrating. They were complex and new, but I had no way of writing them down or recording them so the vanished almost as quickly as they came. The strange thing is, it never really bothered me too much because even at a young age I knew there was plenty more where that came from. As soon as I was old enough to pick up a ukulele I was making up songs. New chord? New song. Before I could even play three chords on a real guitar I had a dozen songs. To this day, I'll never understand writers block and if I pick up a guitar or stroke a keyboard an idea of some sort will appear from somewhere. Sometimes I'll ignore it in the time it takes to think it through twice, sometimes I'll commit it to my phone, sometimes I might even write it, record it and master it in the space of a day.I don't know if I will ever call it a gift, but the day I sell my first song then I'll consider it.

The guy playing it is called Eddie Van Halen and he's one of the best.\u201d I remember him telling me that I said I wanted to learn how to do that. Around this same time, I got a little plastic guitar from my grandmother. It never left my side.

I just needed my finances to catch up with my ambition. ",

It is something that has stayed with me for over 30 years and I appreciate the inspirational quality it continues to bring.  Music is the one thing that has prevented me from growing old.

My middle school band director thought I would like low brass, and she was right. The next year, I taught myself baritone horn, and then later in my seventh grade year I taught myself tuba. I have just stuck with music, and now I participate in the all-state festival on trombone. It's really beautiful, and I hope that I can keep my passion alive as I grow older. I hope you do too!

I was fifteen, on a trip to Croatia, getting bored by the sea, listening to some of my favourite soundtrack music, thinking on one girl I had a crush on. And I thought: \u201cHey, I could try to write something for her.\u201d I had a guitar by my side. So I made a short and simple stupid love song. Yeah. \u201cWow, its so damn easy to make music.\u201d Nevertheless, when I got back home, I got myself a few notation scoring software programs and got amazed how good at it I was. I really enjoyed it and the way I could interact with it. Skip ten years into the future. I am now finishing college. In my city, the majority of musicians (amateurs or university teachers) know about a guy who composed his first opera in age sixteen and who wrote another two, of which one was played in 2015. Yeah, myself. I enjoyed the fame in my teens, yet currently I find it weird that people I didnt even know before recognize me and infact know something about me, because they just heard about me from the radio or read about me in the news.

I still don't know whether it was my gene or destiny or me simply being a lazy bum (:D) which ultimately 'compelled' me to quit my high flying job and settled for an uncertain career.  Before that I had to study extensively in the conservatory and the study is still on. Pursuing 'Music' is a serious business and it's no less cerebral than being a doctor, engineer or a manager. Being an Indian, I just wish someday this social 'stigma' of being a musician fades away and people start respecting our profession. We get paid for making people entertained and trust me it's not an easy job to live with! ",
