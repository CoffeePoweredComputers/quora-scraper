            "answer_text": "Like with all fish, jumping is what they do when they see food on the surface of the water. Water skippers, mosquito's, flies, moths are a few of the reasons. Lack of oxygen and too small of an area, lack of plants for shade.All could contribute.Pond fish are usually cold water fish(Koi or common Gold fish) and require shade, lily's, and good filtration. Ponds must be deep enough for a resting place. Also, watch out for algae, that could also be a problem. ",

So they jump, only to realize the entire world isn\u2019t made out off water, and they will probably die a slow and agonizing death. Or they\u2019re looking for a friend just like Nemo was looking for Dory. Just this time there was no octopus to help give them instructions. ",
