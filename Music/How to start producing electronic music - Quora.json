About half of them are from someone peddling a website or blog or school (never attend a school or college like Berklee to learn this stuff\u2026and that's coming from a university faculty member!). The other half are peddling their sample sets or don't know enough about music production to be giving you an answer (hint: it's NOT about having a DAW, PC, MIDI controller, and studio monitors with a great audio interface\u2026that's the bedroom producer gear loadout for sure, but it's not what to focus on). Do you want a simple, no BS answer from someone who isn't trying to sell you anything or have any connection to those who might benefit from his recommendation? Here:  Dance Music Manual: Tools, Toys, and Techniques Dance Music Manual: Tools, Toys, and Techniques: Rick Snoman: 9781138319646: Amazon.com: Books The Dance Music Manual by Rick Snoman (if you're reading this before December 29 of 2018, buy THIS version: Dance Music Manual: Tools, Toys, and Techniques Dance Music Manual: Tools, Toys, and Techniques: Rick Snoman: 8601404429132: Amazon.com: Books).

            "answer_text": "Hi,I suggest this article:  I decided to write down some guidelines on how to make electronic music (although some of the following tips may apply to other musical genres as well, not just electronic music) covering such things as what hardware is required or recommended, what kind of music making software is needed, how to get a hang of different kind of electronic music styles, etc. There\u2019s a lot of choices in hardware and software, countless of ways to do things in production wise and as many arguments and differing opinions as there are producers. In this article I try to point you to the right direction in electronic music production, mostly based on my own experience. A little info about myself is that electronic music production has been my longtime hobby for years and I\u2019ve been creating music on such genres as trance, downtempo, ambient and experimental. Some of my songs has been released commercially through record labels and has also been used in a film project. Excuse my english, it\u2019s my second language and not so perfect, but I hope you understand and find these guidelines useful and get your answer on how to make electronic music. Also, if you have any questions, opinions or improvements, feel free to leave a comment! Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) *ESSENTIAL* The digital audio workstation (or DAW) serves as your main beat making software and is the heart of your home studio. This is the program that you do everything in \u2014 sequence your instruments, mix and master your songs, and ideally, record vocals. My favorite DAW is hands-down Propellerhead Reason. I\u2019ve been a long time user of Reason, and love how it\u2019s low on CPU resources and virtually crash-free. I still haven\u2019t found any other program that makes it as easy to bang out a quick beat \u2014 the workflow is simply ah-may-zing! Although you can\u2019t use virtual instruments, I can definitely recommend this for beginners since everything you need is in the box. You no longer need a separate program to record vocals since version 6 introduced audio recording. Meanwhile, 6.5 introduced rack extensions (the Propellerhead answer to third-party VSTs) and the included sound bank is incredibly extensive. I use Propellerhead Reason as my main beat making program because not only is it a stable and flexible DAW that allows you to do whatever you want, but because it\u2019s also bundled with great sound content. Not only that, but it\u2019s sound design capabilities is beyond incredible. It gives you plenty of flexibility and a great deal of instruments to make your beats with. For most people (including me), it\u2019s really all you need to start making beats on your computer. There are plenty of other options, but at the end of the day it\u2019s more important that you learn the ins and outs of your DAW so you know how to do what you want to do. (While you may not have the money to purchase the full program right away, beginners would be happy to see that Reason has a little brother called Reason Essentials. When you\u2019re starting out to make beats, there\u2019s no better way to spend a hundred dollars. Just don\u2019t waste your money or time on Dubturbo or Sonic Producer, LOL.) ",

            "answer_text": "I'm not an accomplished producer by any means, but here's my advice:  Don't get too caught up with which software / tools to use. There's no shame in starting with something inexpensive and user friendly like Garage Band, Reason or Ableton. You don't need Logic and hardware synths to make good music.I've heard accomplished producers (Cladue Von Stroke in particular) say that a great way to learn how to produce is to recreate your favorite tracks. This may sound boring and non-creative, but it teaches you how to make your music sound the way you want it to (the hardest part for me).A huge part of making electronic music (particularly dance music) is mastering (adjusting levels and eq'ing each instrument). A great way to do this is to keep another artist's track that you like on hand or even in your project. That way you can constantly compare so you remember what good music sounds like.Invest in some good studio monitors headphones or speakers. Listen to your tracks on a variety of audio systems.Finish tracks, release often and constantly seek feedback. A lot of people (myself included) tend to be overly perfectionist and have a ton of unfinished projects. I find I rarely return to these unfinished projects and don't learn nearly as much from them.Make sure to have fun! Don't stress about it or put pressure on yourself.",

            "answer_text": "Okay. To start off, you're going to need a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation). The forerunners right now are FL Studio, Ableton, Cubase, and Logic. Your DAW is pretty much your map for the music you make. You drag your sounds into the DAW and it plays them in whatever sequence you want. There are many to choose from and they all do the same things, it's just the workflow is different for each one. Next you're going to need a synthesizers and effect VSTs. This is software that you will use to make the sounds that you hear in the song. Synthesizers use oscillators and wavetables to create the sounds you hear in all electronic music. In terms of synths, Serum by Xfer Records and Massive by Native Instruments are the biggest names in the sound design scene right now. For effects, you're gonna want different plugins for different sounds; so to start off I'd equip my self with a reverb, delay, distortion, equalizer, and stereo imager which should cover anything you'd need in the beginning stages of production. For reverb and delay, DAWs almost always come with effects for those so you don't really need external ones in the beginning. While all DAWs have an EQ built in, I'd highly recommend Fabfilter's Pro-Q2, as it allows you to do things many average EQs do not, like solo out the frequencies you are editing. For distortion, there's Ohmicide by Ohm Force, or Camel Crusher by Camel Audio. You'll have little use for a stereo imager in the beginning but it's good to learn about panning as you progress with your production. That's pretty much all the software you need for just starting off, but there's a lot more knowledge than you'd expect needed to really start improving. The top things I would suggest you start studying right from the beginning is: Sound Design Mixing Mastering Music Theory Sidechain Having knowledge of these will give you a big boost for someone just starting off, something I wish I'd known about when I'd just started. Lastly, you'll need a platform to release your music on. The #1 for up-and-coming producers right now is Soundcloud, where you can upload free of charge and get exposure to many big labels once your production knowledge has matured. Hope this helped!

            "answer_text": "There is a great wealth of technical information and pedagogical clues even on this thread lone, so the tools you need are mostly covered, but the real hurdle you'll have to face is how to keep the momentum, as making electronic music is often a solitary affair, even if it is club music. So how do you make music that invigorates you to make more music? That's what I'll speak to here: Try to foster the habit of listening to a variety of music, both actively and passively.  Especially when you listen to electronic music, start asking yourself why you like certain things about it, be it a particular sound or a feeling you get at a particular moment. Then think about how those sounds or that effect might be made, dissect what you hear.  Often an amazing sound is actually 2 or more combined. This is the mindset of a maker and I think everything else important follows from this.  You can have a lot of fun being creative by challenging yourself when you sit down to work on a track.  Try using a smaller palette/ less sounds than whatever you're used to. Try being minimal. Try being maximal. Try using sounds you find ugly.  The goal here is to learn and expand the range of what you can do. Figure out if you need some physicality to get motivated about your music. I couldn't do without an actual keyboard, a guitar, a bass and sometimes a sampler, I need something to hit and play. Maybe you don't need this, but it's something you should be aware of. Make songs and bounce them frequently, put them on an iPod or whatever you use, and constantly listen to and evaluate them in the context of the rest of your music. Keep making stuff and don't worry about the flaws unless you are actively trying to fix them, in which case, be fucking ruthless! Listen to the early examples of whatever sub-genre(s) of electronic music you like. It's usually awesome. You don't need another list of software, you need to figure out why you want to do this in the first place, and keep that motivation alive. For me, there is nothing like struggling with a track for a while and then finally feeling something amazing coming through. Getting the software is the easy part. ",

            "answer_text": "So, you are a classical pianist and wan to make some electronic music? Well, the easiest way to start is by getting a DAW for your computer. Which one specifically depends on two factors: a) what OS your computer has and b) your personal preference of the workflow. You can do just about everything with just about every DAW, just with differing ways to get it done, which is why I normally advice to download a bunch of demos of different DAWs, play around with them and then get the one that \u201cfeels\u201d right. They are all rather complex and huge programs, mind, so you will need some time to really learn the one you choose. I\u2019d start by actually reading the manual back and forth, playing around with it and using the internet. You\u2019ll generally find tutorials for every DAW under the sun and if you get more knowledgeable you\u2019ll also be able to adapt/\u201ctranslate\u201d tutorials for other DAWs\u2014you\u2019ll just have to keep at it and learn. Hardware-wise you actually should be OK with a decent computer if it isn\u2019t too old. In fact, most likely you can just start with what you have if you have one. If not, you do want the strongest CPU you can get, a decent amount of RAM and as much Storage as possible. In regards to audio hardware you could get away with just using your on-board sound card at first\u2014I did that for years\u2014but since you are a classical pianist it would a shame not to make use of that, so you might actually want a decent audio interface coupled with a Midi-Keyboard. The Interface in this case mostly to reduce the latency\u2014which your onboard will likely be horrible with\u2014which will actually matter when you use a keyboard as over a certain threshold it will feel really awkward to play due to the delay between you pressing a key and the sound actually, well, sounding. Lastly, you also want a decent pair of as-linear-as-possible studio-headphones and/or studio-monitors. In case of the latter you also want some acoustic treatment for the room you work in\u2014I am sure as a classical pianist you do know how different rooms can sound from each other and when producing music, be it electronic or not, those colorations don\u2019t make it any easier to actually hear what you are doing. For knowledge regarding how to make the music, well, that is a bit more complicated. You mentioned you already know a lot of musical theory\u2014which is helpful\u2014but you will notice that you can\u2014and in some cases must\u2014ignore most of it. Electronic music often does not really care all that much for that and instead is more concerned with how different sounds work together. You\u2019ll get a feel for that with time and likely you\u2019ll also find your own sound pretty fast. Emulating others does help learning, of course, however, don\u2019t forget to experiment on your own and just do what you want, don\u2019t force yourself to have a certain sound when your natural sound goes in a different direction\u2014you might actually end up making something completely different then you set out to do at first. Also helpful is reading up on how different synthesizer types work on a technical level, what the different things do an mean, what the different effects are and how they work on a technical and physical level\u2026 basically: be a sponge for all the knowledge you can get, even if it is very dry and technical. The understanding will help you using your gear a lot. The internet is your friend, of course. This point is also my personal measurement if someone actually cares for making electronic music or if they just blindly tinker around: someone who actually cares will basically be a nerd by necessity. You also want to read up on mixing and mastering: you find all kinds of tutorials online and talking with other people also can help a lot. Again, a lot of it will be surprisingly technical in nature\u2014especially once you start learning what specific instruments use which frequency bands or what the different frequency bands actually do in context of music\u2014but if one wants to make something like electronic music you\u2019d assume one is aware that that is just part of the deal. Lastly: it helps to analyze a lot of (electronic) music. Not just listen to but actively analyzing, picking apart what each instrument does, how they work together, what timings the rhythm works on, etc. etc.\u2014I\u2019m sure you know what I mean. And from there it is\u2026 well, experimenting and just making music. There is a lot of theoretical knowledge you\u2019ll need to learn, yes, but the fun part, actually making music, luckily is still often just 98% \u201cexperiment around until it works\u201d and 2% \u201cI\u2019ve no clue how that works but it sounds neat (aka. \u201chappy accidents\u201d)\u201d And don\u2019t forget: your first hundred songs will be crap, but that is normal so don\u2019t let yourself get dragged down by it if you just can\u2019t get it sounding quite right yet. No master ever just fell out of the sky. ",

            "answer_text": "If you ask out of curiosity, I could elaborate a bit of history first. As a teacher myself in audio technologies, I always spend time explaining the long evolution of technology at the service of music.  It can be first traced to the 13th century with al-Jazari, who invented the first robot music, an automaton that was meant to entertain guests. Even then, it was about having automatic machine where a third party would be creating music instead of humans. The idea of electronic, or technological music, takes interests in various approaches: Reproducing/imitating sound.Facilitating and democratizing the art of music.Having the highest level of technology as music instruments.Different important milestones: Invention of electrical amplifications, the beginning of amplified sound. (1906)Theremin and other electronic playable machines.(1920)Musique Concr\u00e8te/Electroacoustics, who used tapes as a creative medium (and more).First synthesizers, who, with oscillators, can replicate sounds. (1970's)Computer music.I know this might be a bit confusing but I can also just send you to a Youtube, learn how to use a DAW like Ableton Live (one of the most intuitive and easy to learn as well as, so many tutorials online) but one important thing I find, is to know a bit of the origins of what a simple software can do for you. You'll be soon using various techniques to create music entirely made by your computer, your new assistant. You can quickly understand how a DAW works, but the techniques can be discussed for hours and asking how electronic is created, can quickly become intricate, complicated, abstract, surreal and slightly overwhelming. Why? Electronic music of today will be defined into various categories: Sound design. Creating your own sounds, textures, from sound synthesis, using oscillators.Programming. You can dig at the core of your compute and use audio-language related envronment such as MAX/MSP. You'll need to understand programming in general and have a lot of time to produce your first bleeps.Composing/sequencing. Using loops or your own sounds, to create a narrative story.Sampling. Using recorded sounds or found sounds and manipulate them.So, it's a really absorbing hobby. And asking to describe how to do it, also comes from a perspective. As a music producer, I really work on creating from scratch, my own synthesizers (can take a few weeks) in a software named Reaktor, then will spend time running it through external effects, record everything in a DAW then assemble everything in Ableton Live. Making a song can take a lot of time.  Some other producers feel content with buying loops and then playing with them. To each its own, there's no best or real way to make music. But funny thing is, in the 90's, so many people were mocking me about making electronic music, thinking it was really easy. Nowadays, I invite whoever thinks it's easy to sit by myself for an evening of production. I swear, no one ever thinks its easy after seeing me work! ",

            "answer_text": "There are various approaches to producing electronic music, none of them exclusive. Generally speaking, you have the hardware approach and the software approach. Hardware involves various synths, drum machines, groove boxes, MIDI controllers, etc. The software approach involves using a computer with the proper specs, a DAW (digital audio workstation) and various other pieces of software, often plugins such as VSTs, that enable other functionality, effects and instrumentation.  Often, the two approaches are combined, and there have been many debates over the pros and cons of each approach. The truth is that the approach that works for you and makes you happy is the only one that matters. Having said this, it is important to keep things simple at the beginning. I have seen others quit due to the fact that they expected too much right away, or had too much gear, or advanced gear beyond their understanding, and they became frustrated and quit.  What you want to do is begin learning the basics of bars and measures, tempo and beats. Learn how to make a single rhythm pattern, then try adding a bassline to it. Create a similar pattern and then chain the two together. These types of simple exercises will gradually enable you to become familiar with the larger DAW environment, or with whatever hardware you are using. This is basically how you get started. Don't spend too much money at first. Also, don't just buy what your favorite artist has without going to a music store and playing with it first. Watch Youtube videos with various pieces of gear/software. You also want to remember that being a gear-hog and being a music producer are two different things. You don't need tons of gear or even expensive gear. In fact, lots of gear that is considered boutique and high-end is actually less capable than older gear you can get for less money. For example, don't get sucked into buying stuff like Elektron gear unless you already know that is the workflow you want. While you practice the basics, you are going to come across the concept of mixing. This is very important and can't be learned overnight. When you have spare time, watch some videos about using EQ properly on each instrument, as this will determine the clarity and true energy of your mix. Many novices make the mistake of believing that big awesome sounds (the kind companies use to sell VST synths) are what you want. In reality, however, those large sounds eat up your frequency bandwidth. What you really want to do is learn how smaller sounds, controlled with EQ, compression, the stereo field, etc., combine to create one large, clean mix.  Once you understand the basics, go back to your favorite tunes and study them. Listen to the structures they use, and try to understand the flow of energy. Understand that when you produce a track, it's not just about the notes and the sounds, but the energy, and also the production technique. Ask yourself what the audience needs to hear, and then figure out how to accomplish that without compromising your own artistic integrity. Have fun and good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "There is no single right answer to this question. It's sort of like asking \"what is the best way to learn to paint like Picasso?\" Whilst one certainly can learn to become a competent painter through practice and lessons, there is no fixed way to become a masterful artist. The same applies with music, in my opinion. With regards to electronic music specifically, there are two major components in the equation. One is audio engineering, which you can learn about through courses and by reading online, but also requires a tremendous amount of practice and ear training. Most modern electronic music employs extensive use of advanced audio engineering techniques. At a basic level, it is critical to gain a deep understanding of equalization (EQ) and compression. These are what enable electronic music producers to mix together so many different sounds across a wide frequency spectrum without ending up with a \"muddy\" sound. The other half of electronic music is the actual music. It's very easy to create derivative, uncreative electronic music. Ultimately, creating high quality electronic music requires true musicianship in the artistic sense. Electronic music also presents a unique set of musical challenges, in that there are very few timbral restrictions placed on the composer (i.e. you do not have a fixed set of instruments or sounds to work with). In my opinion, the best way to get started is to simply dive in and start experimenting on your own. The easiest way to do this is with software. There are many freeware programs available, and many of the large software companies offer free trials. Entire websites are devoted to covering audio production gear (both software and hardware). The heart of any modern studio setup tends to be a DAW (digital audio workstation). Many electronic music producers are currently using Ableton Live, as its workflow is built around manipulating loops. Other common DAWs are Apple Logic, Cakewalk SONAR, Steinberg Cubase, MOTU Digital Performer and Digidesign Pro Tools. ",

            "answer_text": "My three essential rules for mastering any craft, in ascending order of importance: FeedbackInputPractice To explain: Practice: you need to do something to get better at it.  A lot.  As in, an hour or two per day, almost every day, for years. In \"The Tipping Point\", he made a pretty good case for 10,000 hours being the amount of practice it takes to master a skillset.  Want to be a pro baseball player?  Play a lot of baseball.  Famous author?  Write oodles of novels.  Electronic musician?  Log hours fiddling in DAWs. Input: you can NOT become a great writer without reading tons of books.  You can't direct great movies without watching one or two.  Listen to lots of tunes.  I'm hoping though that if you want to be a musician, you're already doing this. Feedback: get some constructive criticism from people qualified to give it.  Otherwise you could waste serious time going down wrong roads.  Also get opinions from less-informed fans of your genre.  Remember the rule of thumb for fan feedback: they'll always know <i>when</i> there's a problem, they'll never know <i>what</i> the problem is.  Use uneducated fan feedback to locate rough patches, use learned feedback to fix them.  And listen to all feedback, but don't automatically swallow it--bad advice exists; that's why it's important to get a large volume of feedback, to minimize damage from individual pieces of bum advice. So that's it, my three essentials to master any craft.  I don't have any credentials to flash here, as I am not a professional DJ (although people <i>have</i> danced to my beats-and-blips), but fuck it, I'll go ahead and vouch for my rules anyway.

Computer & DAW - if you have a Mac, I would highly recommend purchasing \u201cLogic Pro X\u201d. I am biased because I use this Digital Audio Workstation, however arguments for also include its price, beginner friendly interface, and funnily enough the logicality of the way it works! Lots of people recommend Ableton Live too, so download the demo version of that as well as Garage Band (Logic\u2019s little brother) and see which one works for your brain the best. If you don't have a Mac, Ableton will be more suitable and or other programs like Reason, FL Studio and Cubase\u2026 do some research in to these!DAW Experience - have you ever used a music program before? The internet is jam packed full of tutorials for all of these programs. No matter where you are in the process, there is an unlimited resource of how to\u2019s all over YouTube and forums etc. The web is one your most vital tools. (Try MusicTechHelpGuy for a literal step by step Logic Pro X breakdown)Studio Monitors - integral to creating music that is going to be suitable on all sound systems is purchasing a set of studio monitors. Unlike your car stereo or boom box at home, there is no Equalisation or Compression built in - it's as pure as it can sound. There are people who\u2019ll be able to put that in much more specific terms than me but this is super vital. They can go cheap, or they can go outrageously expensive!MIDI Keyboard - this is the most logical way to start \u201cmaking sounds\u201d. Since you're a pianist I suggest getting a larger midi keyboard - they're very cheap, eBay has tonnes. Have a USB 2.0 cord (like a printer USB) ready, plug it in, select a track in your DAW, choose a software synth or instrument or piano or drum\u2026 the world is literally now your oyster.These are what I believe to be the fundamentals of beginning to produce electronic music, and there's always a way to do it on the cheaper side if budget is a problem. If you're interested in recording vocals or live instruments, purchase an audio interface & a decent condenser microphone. Use the internet to find out about products through forums, there will always be enough information to make an informed decision. Good luck in your creative endeavours! ",

            "answer_text": "Been playing piano since 9, composing and producing since middle school. Honestly, get a cheap Yamaha keyboard and start playing around with sounds. Also take note of your favorite music. You want to develop your style and be childlike before you start learning the structural stuff. Don't worry about technique. After a few months, get some weekly lessons in piano, guitar, or whatever you like(I'd say piano!) . Keep playing around on the side, but now you'll have a bit more music knowledge. You'll know basic music theory after taking lessons, but after a few months of lessons take a short music theory course online or in school where you'll learn more about chords, key signatures, etc. This is the fun part bc now you can take all the stuff youve been playing with to a higher level. Now it's time for production. Learn how to arrange basic tracks or beats from start to finish. I started with a program called Anvil Studios for PC years ago. MuLab is also cool(for Mac). If you have money to spend, buy FL Studio or Ableton. After, you'll get into instrumentation and choosing the right sounds. Don't worry too much about mixing and effects . Your main focus should be creating something musically sound. There are many places to download or purchase sound loops or vocal samples online. Sone people stop here and send their tracks over to a mixing/mastering engineer (who have MANY years of experience) and it\u2019s usually not advised to master your own tracks. If you want to learn mixing, it's a lot of work but doable if you really want to do it. You can find tutorials on all of these but the key is to be as unrestrained as possible. Anything you make can become a masterpiece. I burned out and took a break for years because I was too focused on doing everything \u201c\"correctly.\u201d It's just Art. ",

            "answer_text": "When I was young in 70s I built an 8-steps 1 note sequencer. That was before MIDI. Now is the good time to start! There are thousands of EM styles. A public is prepared to listen to anything - from Noise to Trance. There are styles which integrate acoustical sources as vocal or any mic signal and ones are generated completely within computer. So, choosing a style - is, perhaps, Task #1. Personally, I like the idea to start from\u2026 mobile. Choose any app, try dozens, find what you like. A modern mobile phone is incredibly powerful beast. It can record / transform / generate sounds, but then - compose / edit / publish your compositions. If you want to start from the middle of the road, invest into any USB sound interface for your computer. Any budget package ($200\u2013$300) consists of an interface and software. You will start definitely in the good form. Another, Top Dream $$$ Start: to become an analogist! Learn everything Moog and others, produces, learn basic with a real analog ADSR, Filters, VCO\u2019s. \u2018Writing electronic music\u2019 means writing music. Learn to play some acoustical instrument - guitar, piano, violin. Learn to write music - melody and harmony. Probably, that is Task #0. Mobile is easy and feature rich. Analog is expensive, but a solid platform for years. DAW is for everything. ",

            "answer_text": "Assuming you are new music production. Follow this guide and you will avoid years of frustration. Take 10 of your current favorite tracks. They must have been released in the last 6 months and by a known label in your genre. Ideally you know or can figure out the bpm and key. Import the first track into your DAW. Now create empty tracks and label them Kick, Bass, Percussion, Synth, Pad, Effect, etc. In each of these tracks create a blank MIDI region and map out the track sound by sound. So if you here the kick for 8 bars you will have a corresponding 8 bar blank MIDI region labeled \u201cKick\u201d. If the kick drops out for 4 bars leave that part of the track blank. Repeat this for all the main sounds you can hear. You don\u2019t have to get too detailed for this first exercise. By the end you should have a basic outline/template. Why is a template important? DJs, labels, listeners look for familiarity. In dance music much of that will come through track structure - intro, break, drop, bridge, outro. Structure also will give you a roadmap to complete a track. Now repeat this for the other 9 tracks. But each time get more detailed. Add a track for snare rolls, filtered percussion, fading synths, etc. By the end of the exercises you should have 10 templates. Study them and look for patterns. Don\u2019t make an original track yet. Use these 10 templates and remix 10 of your favorite tracks. Stick to the template. Don't vary. Don't play with the melody. Don\u2019t veer off into making an original. Remix only at this point. Once you\u2019ve completed these 10 remixes you are now ready to start learning more about mixing techniques, choosing plugins, sound design and so on. It will take time. But if you dedicate yourself you\u2019ll be light years ahead of every other bedroom producer out there. All the best. ",

If thats you. Skip this step and read the other steps because they ARE relevant. Now if you\u2019ve never made music or played and instrument you may feel completely confused about where to start, but everyone starts somewhere. So I\u2019d do your research and learn about these basics bullet points: \u2013 Learn what a Beat & Bar is (not a place where you go and get drunk). \u2013 Learn what a time signature is.\u2013 Learn about BPM (Beats Per Minute) View a tutorial that covers all of the above \u2013 Learn the difference between major and minor keys. \u2013 View tutorial \u2013 Learn what KEY is and means. \u2013 View tutorial\u2013 Learn an instrument, I highly recommend learning to play the piano. Because if you\u2019re going to be a producer. You\u2019ll be using the keyboard/piano layout a lot. \u2013 View tutorial \u2013 Learn basic chords and chord sequences. \u2013 View tutorial Now learning all of the above may take a while and some of the tutorials may be a bit long winded. But If you know the basics of all the above you\u2019ll have a massive advantage when it comes to producing your own electronic dance music, why? Because you\u2019ll have the understanding of how songs work and how they\u2019re structured. This gives you an amazing starting point. Enjoy -Allen ",

            "answer_text": " I decided to write down some guidelines on how to make electronic music (although some of the following tips may apply to other musical genres as well, not just electronic music) covering such things as what hardware is required or recommended, what kind of music making software is needed, how to get a hang of different kind of electronic music styles, etc. There\u2019s a lot of choices in hardware and software, countless of ways to do things in production wise and as many arguments and differing opinions as there are producers. In this article I try to point you to the right direction in electronic music production, mostly based on my own experience. A little info about myself is that electronic music production has been my longtime hobby for years and I\u2019ve been creating music on such genres as trance, downtempo, ambient and experimental. Some of my songs has been released commercially through record labels and has also been used in a film project. Excuse my english, it\u2019s my second language and not so perfect, but I hope you understand and find these guidelines useful and get your answer on how to make electronic music. Also, if you have any questions, opinions or improvements, feel free to leave a comment! Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) *ESSENTIAL* The digital audio workstation (or DAW) serves as your main beat making software and is the heart of your home studio. This is the program that you do everything in \u2014 sequence your instruments, mix and master your songs, and ideally, record vocals. My favorite DAW is hands-down Propellerhead Reason. I\u2019ve been a long time user of Reason, and love how it\u2019s low on CPU resources and virtually crash-free. I still haven\u2019t found any other program that makes it as easy to bang out a quick beat \u2014 the workflow is simply ah-may-zing! Although you can\u2019t use virtual instruments, I can definitely recommend this for beginners since everything you need is in the box. You no longer need a separate program to record vocals since version 6 introduced audio recording. Meanwhile, 6.5 introduced rack extensions (the Propellerhead answer to third-party VSTs) and the included sound bank is incredibly extensive. I use Propellerhead Reason as my main beat making program because not only is it a stable and flexible DAW that allows you to do whatever you want, but because it\u2019s also bundled with great sound content. Not only that, but it\u2019s sound design capabilities is beyond incredible. It gives you plenty of flexibility and a great deal of instruments to make your beats with. For most people (including me), it\u2019s really all you need to start making beats on your computer. There are plenty of other options, but at the end of the day it\u2019s more important that you learn the ins and outs of your DAW so you know how to do what you want to do. (While you may not have the money to purchase the full program right away, beginners would be happy to see that Reason has a little brother called Reason Essentials. When you\u2019re starting out to make beats, there\u2019s no better way to spend a hundred dollars. Just don\u2019t waste your money or time on Dubturbo or Sonic Producer, LOL.) ",

            "answer_text": "Start by focusing not exclusively electronic music, but develop your general musical skills (especially your hearing) and study the BASICS of audio engineering extensively. Point 1 from Peter\u2019s answer is absolutely spot on. It makes me smile these days when well-meaning guys just getting into the game ask me on end about which DAW is best or which plugin suites they should buy. Here\u2019s the truth: All DAWs worth their salt do EXACTLY the same thing (off the top of my head I\u2019d recommend Pro Tools, Logic, Sonar, Cubase, Studio One, FL Studio, Ableton, Reason, Bitwig or Reaper to name a few). It\u2019s true that professionals generally have a preference but that\u2019s mostly down to workflow; for instance I like logic a lot but because I mostly work in pro tools the keyboard shortcuts for PT are second nature to me. When I have to use Logic, guess what, they don\u2019t work :) and that slows me down, but that doesn\u2019t mean either DAW is better or worse. Also the majority of DAWs come with free plugins which I could (and HAVE, btw) used exclusively to mix tracks for commercial release without any expensive Waves, NI, UAD, Soundtoys or whatever extras. You don\u2019t need them to get professional results, and until you know how to use each and every single one of the plugins that comes with your DAW, buying plugins is a waste of money that could be put to better use, like on acoustic treatment for your room. First thing first: pick a DAW that you like the look of and learn it back to front. Learn what EQ is, and how to use it. Learn about compression, and how to use it. Learn about using reverb/delays effectively. Learn these things back to front, and download one of the many apps available that test your knowledge of frequencies. Train your ears, listen to lots of different types of music, and pick up a basic music theory manual. If you don\u2019t play piano/keys, grab a beginner\u2019s book on that too because keyboard skills are ESSENTIAL especially for electronic music production. Next: I know it\u2019s tempting to blow money on super awesome speakers, but they\u2019re next to useless if your room\u2019s acoustics are problematic. Research stuff like standing waves, room modes etc and get yourself some materials to treat it. Headphones might seem like an easy way out of this but unfortunately even the best headphones in the world aren\u2019t going to give you a realistic idea of how your bass levels will respond on a proper system. Reason: Sub/Bass frequencies require BIG woofers to reproduce them properly. Headphones = too small. If it comes down to a choice between monitors and acoustics, choose acoustics every time. Get yourself a decent MIDI controller keyboard (I like AKAI personally), some reasonably priced headphones for checking small details that get lost on monitors (I recommend something like Sennheiser 280s to start off with) and have at it. Oh, and I\u2019m just assuming you already have an audio interface - if not, Focusrite make very reliable and high quality kit for a reasonable price. I could go on forever, but since your question is \u2018how do I start?\u2019 I\u2019ll leave it there for now. Hope that helps, good luck and if you have any more questions don\u2019t hesitate to get in touch directly. All the best, Benedict ",

            "answer_text": "A2A Well, that\u2019s a very broad question which there is no unilateral answer to. It is in fact possible to produce at least instrumentals on a Macbook alone. Your starting point is a DAW (digital audio workstation) such as Ableton, Logic, Cubase etc. The choice depends on your preference on how to produce (and your budget). DAWs like Logic and Cubase are more rooted in the \u201cold school\u201d methods of multitrack recording and mixing whereas Ableton and Reason have a different architecture and slightly more oriented towards DJs than musicians. In any case, most DAWs come with a standard selection of quite useable AU plugins, with virtual instruments such as drum machine, sampler, synths, e-piano plus some decent FX like compression, delay and reverb. It should be enough for you to get started. For starters you can actually use the keyboard on your Mac for recording simple chords and bass lines and your mouse for note by note input. I would however suggest to get a USB controller keyboard with pads for recording the drum tracks. Examples: Novation Impulse, M-Audio Oxygen, Akai MPK etc. The right choice depends on your preferences and your budget. The above is enough to start producing inside the Mac in premix quality. Don\u2019t expect tunes in pro quality ready to be released though as long as you don\u2019t have proper monitoring which should be as neutral as possible. There is a whole science around monitoring, including finding the right acoustic environment/treatment etc\u2026 I could write pages if I had time. The next step (basically at the same time as all of the above) would be to get a pair of active nearfield monitors. The same applies here in terms of budget and preference. Btw KRK have some very decent and reasonably priced ones. Then since the headphone output of the Macbook is far from being optimised for driving studio monitors, one day you will look into audio interfaces with a decent preamp for microphone recordings in case you want to add vocals to your creations. I don\u2019t know about specific online courses for electronic music but there are plenty of tutorials on Youtube. Like myself, most electronic producers are autodidacts. After learning the basics experimenting is the key. Speaking for myself I was lucky enough to grow up together with the first hardware synths and drummies in the pre-MIDI era. Then came MIDI and I was hooked. With the little I could afford back in the 80s I learned about synth and drum programming out of the box with no instructions whatsoever. I think the less gear you have in the beginning the faster you will get familiar with the basics and once you get the hang of it it will become a natural progression. The main thing is enthusiasm and plenty of good ideas and inspiration. Get funky! Edit - here\u2019s an example for Logic X (which is what I use)  ",

            "answer_text": "Actually, there is a fantastic online university for electronic musicians that takes you from the begining stages.  It's called Sonic Academy and the videos teach you genre specific tips, tips about recording, using compression, reverb, etc.  I've watched a lot of tutorials and these are some of the most helpful because of the genre specific tips.  It does cost, but some of the videos are free. They actually have a video that teaches you some of the techniques of JUSTICE and Daft Punk.  I watched this particular video and followed along and made a pretty great crunchy bassline.  I was very happy with it.www.SonicAcademy.comLink here: http://www.sonicacademy.com/Producer/Course//How_to_Make_French_House_with_Reason_4_-_Justice.cid2717  For a lot of the videos these use specific software like Reason, Ableton, Logic or Cubase.  These are, of course, the most popular software for making electronic music.  I switched from Cubase to Ableton because of how easy it is to start making music.  The aspects I like most about Ableton from the beginner perspective, are the tutorials and the the help box at the bottom left of the screen.  You can scroll over anything and learn what it does.  If you have a Mac, I would also suggest Logic.  You can download demos of most of these software on the website. ",

Your objectives will dictate what kind/genre of electronic music you should study.

You\u2019ll need a computer and some basic software and headphones. If you want to track any acoustic or live instruments/voice, you\u2019ll need an audio interface and a microphone. But if you use want to start with just basic programming of drums and synths, you can do it all \u201cin the box\u201d with computer, software and headphones. I\u2019m a Cubase guy, but for the money I love the program Logic for recording music. It is a pro system, relatively inexpensive, and has great software synths and processing effects included. And there are tons of tutorials online to get you from the basics and beyond. If you own a mac, you get Garageband for free, and that is a great recording system to start out with and grow into Logic. But whatever you decide, just know that there are so many great how-to videos out there to show you how to use your recording software, how to build sounds with synth and drum software and how to bring those sounds together into a full song. The great thing about making music is that, unlike so many industries, it has just gotten cheaper to do over the years. I have a pretty huge setup now, but I started on some pretty humble gear. And I made a lot of money using that gear. So, it really comes down to creativity and basic tools. Here\u2019s a look at the little setup I used to build songs that started my career with Selena Gomez and Miley Cyrus:  ",

Mixing and MasteringIt's the most important aspect if you want your sound to be as good as the pros, and it can be the difference between landing a release on a label or not.

If thats you. Skip this step and read the other steps because they ARE relevant. Now if you\u2019ve never made music or played and instrument you may feel completely confused about where to start, but everyone starts somewhere. So I\u2019d do your research and learn about these basics bullet points: \u2013 Learn what a Beat & Bar is (not a place where you go and get drunk). \u2013 Learn what a time signature is.\u2013 Learn about BPM (Beats Per Minute) View a tutorial that covers all of the above \u2013 Learn the difference between major and minor keys. \u2013 View tutorial \u2013 Learn what KEY is and means. \u2013 View tutorial\u2013 Learn an instrument, I highly recommend learning to play the piano. Because if you\u2019re going to be a producer. You\u2019ll be using the keyboard/piano layout a lot. \u2013 View tutorial \u2013 Learn basic chords and chord sequences. \u2013 View tutorial Now learning all of the above may take a while and some of the tutorials may be a bit long winded.

            "answer_text": "Well let me say first of all that when I started producing I was going for a denser sound with my beats but there\u2019s a reason why EDM is where most people start from. EDM is an art form that simply requires a kick, any kick. The best part about this is the fact that all beats must have a theme.   Whether it is dubstep, trance, future bass or the recent tropical wave, the beauty of electronic is the vastness of its genre. I started with FL and went on to download packs from all over the internet. I discovered later that it wasn\u2019t the amount of samples you had but the ability you have in composing them together to create a rhythm. When you begin, if you are already good in the keyboard find a 5-sec long piano roll and fit it at the beginning, if not, find a key that you like and play around it till you have that 5-sec roll Note: It mustn\u2019t be 5-secs, Martin and Axwell have been known to use almost 10-secs of funny instruments like the banjo, lead guitar etc. NB: This layout is just an example, please, don\u2019t limit your creativity, that is the whole point of electronic, EXPERIMENT!!!! So, next, repeat the piano roll with a kick and generate a synth alongside the entire pattern  Now, get ready for the good part Repeat this pattern again for some time (as it suits you) then begin to enter the bass drop build up     Will it be good on the first try? I doubt it but at least you can begin to understand what you want from the track so bear with me. I\u2019m about to explain what I have learnt from the 2008 - 2017 EDM sub-niches Future Bass : This niche differs from regular EDM due to the lighter synths involved. This genre would be very noisy if not for the singular rule that limits the number of patterns applied to 5. Examples of this include Light by San Holo Dubstep : This was the most common form of EDM on the market when the genre first surfaced. It is so called because of its highly-anticipated bass drop and its use of excessive reverb and heavy synths.Trance: Out of a more compressed, needy electronic sound came Trance. This niche is originally House but, for lack of better names for the niche and since, Kygo sounds nothing like Guetta, we have trance.Tropical Wave: When it comes to this niche, many have said that this can\u2019t possible have evolved from EDM well, it\u2019s true. Dance music, which is essentially EDM and influences from synth-pop to jazz and more frequently reggaeton has built an empire around this analogy.If you are a new producer trying to get your hands dirty with some simple production tutorials try How To Make A Powerful EDM Track - FL Beat Tutorials and don\u2019t forget to export in the highest audio quality your computer can process GOOD LUCK PLAYING!!!

(B) Buy some analog hardware, a good analog synth will make the music process fun and will double as a midi controller and keybaord! (C) Buy NI Maschine and learn how to use the sampler in that, it's the bizz (D) REALLY Listen to your favorite songs and learn how they have made the Chorus/Verse/bridge song structure and try to replicate that structure in your own song. (E) Be creative. Take an existing drum loop and try to re-create each sound from the kit by sampling just your voice, listen to how original it sounds! (F) Go out into nature with a portable recorder and sample every sound you find, then make a song out of samples from that. (G) Make the lead melody FIRST, make it catchy. Then build your entire song around that. (H) Hang out with Tiesto  Don't give up  www.damienosborne.com ",

Quite the opposite, really. But if you are continuing to make tracks, it will eventually sound good.  As time goes by, you can start to invest in VST's, speakers and MIDI controllers.

            "answer_text": "Well, first of all, you need a computer, preferably one with very good or excellent performance specs, like a huge amount of RAM, and a high-end processor, and a high-end graphics card. Also, you need to invest in software to make the music. You can use Fruity Loops as a starting point program, since it is free, and is functional enough to start with. You also have to have a very well-made knowledge base for how to create it. Once you have all that down, then you can start the actual making music part. Without a computer, you really can\u2019t do much of anything with it. Now, the type of operating system you use is solely up to personal preference. I\u2019ve heard that many artists/musicians use Macs, but you can also use Windows PCs for that too. It just depends on what you are accustomed to using. I prefer Windows, because it is what I have used since I was three years old. So, it is what I am accustomed to using. But, you may prefer to use a Mac computer. Or, you may even prefer Linux. It is totally up to your personal preference. I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors. Thank you for reading this answer. ",

Its free but you pay around \u00a350 for the full version. Other programs such as fruity loops are more complicated and theres programs like ableton live or cubase which are even more complicated. Youll need a computer with low latency (ie high amount of RAM) and low noise - fans in normal computers can interfere with recording. You will also need a decent sound card and possibly an interface for whatever instrument you play. If you dont already write music start listening to how it is formed. The drums, the bass, synth, lead, rhythm etc and how it hangs together. Start a basic track by using drums then adding layers to create somethkng. Collect as many samples as you can and these can be used as patches, loops or manipulated through midi keyboard or other software to add depth to your tracks. Find others that do it and speak to them. Acid has a community platform. Most cproducers are on soundcloud. There are production courses you can attend. Enjoy and good luck. ",

With OpenMPT you can create music similiar to how elecronic composers used to do it in the Amiga and DOS times, and save them in old (but well supported) module formats (MOD,S3M,XM,IT), which act like MIDI files, but have there samples, acting as instruments, integrated inside the file. Another seqencer/tracker i would recommend for creating electronic music is Renoise (low cost and well supported). For drum packs, they can be created using an VSTi inside an DAW (i usualy use BasicBat on OpenMPT), or get them from an wepside housing them, like kb6 (most drum packs are for free but for some, you have to donate). One thing, what kind of electronic music? There are several genres (these days Pop, Disco, Hip-Hop, Trance, Jungle, Bass and Drum, even New Age and so on...), so it may not sound the same. Just make your music the way it fits your musical style. ",

I play around with it once a week for half an hour or so, and I've found that learning how to make \"a song\" is VERY EASY. But making a song that sounds good is INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED! The reason it's complicated is that when you have a sound in your head that you want to create, you've got a specific sound... so you have to search through about 1000 different sounds on FL Studio to find it, but you'll find one that's ALMOST RIGHT and you'll have to use special effects to make it exactly how you want it. To memorize what all these sounds sound like and how to find them, you need to spend HOURSSSS listening to each sound. ",
