            "answer_text": "Real, authentic boom bap is representative of an era. And with that particular span of time, the Golden Era of Hip-Hop in the late 80s-90s, you have to take into account the technology available used to produce it, the music that was available to sample and the medium that sampled music was on (primarily vinyl). Samplers were limited to 8 and 12-bit processing power and later 16-bit (CD quality is 16-bit depth, 44.1khz sample rate). Why this is important is that when a record was sampled it was sampled at a low-resolution and when played back the sound had grit and crunch adding to the characteristic of the sound. The most iconic samplers were the SP12, and the SP1200. Both 12-bit at around 26000-27500 khz sample rate with analog filters on the outputs. Records were sampled sped up at a higher pitch to allow the producer to get more sample time as these machines were limited to 5\u201310 seconds of sampling time. The samples were the pitched down it would add even more artifacts (aliasing) to the sound. It is important to note that even though there are bitcrusher plugins and emulations that attempt to recreate the grit and artifacts that these machines imposed onto sound that none of them come close. There is nothing like a real SP1200. Many hit records were made on the SPs. Another key characteristic is most boom bap is in the 90\u2013100bpm range. This is in contrast to trap where the sound field is squeeky clean. Not to say that trap can\u2019t be gritty, but producers aren\u2019t limited to 10 seconds of sampling time and vinyl sampling. It\u2019s a different era where technology is unlimited as to what you want to do and get the sounds you want. Early trap was typically sequenced at 140bpm with a half-time feel that feels like 70bpm. Since trap took off in popularity the tempo is varying as producers experiment with the genre. This was just exploring a couple of facets of these genres. The sound differences for me are a very important part of the aesthetic of the music which goes back to the technology available at the time they were created. I would be interested to here modern trap beats produced on 12-bit lofi samplers such as the SP1200, Emax etc. I think it would be an interesting listen! ",

            "answer_text": "The main musical difference between boom bap and trap beats is sixteenth note pulse versus thirty-second note pulse. In rap beats, the pulse is where you usually find the hi-hats. Boom-bap follows the conventions of funk, where the hi-hats are every eighth or sixteenth note, aside from occasional skips or embellishments. In trap, the hi-hats are on the thirty-second notes (aside from skips or embellishments), so there are more of them in the bar. Even though the tempo of trap songs is usually slower, the beats feel faster, because the finer rhythmic subdivisions make the hits more frequent. To make matters more confusing, producers usually do their trap beats with their DAW session or drum machine tempo set twice as fast as they would for boom-bap beats. This is because thirty-second note grids are annoying to work with, and they\u2019re impossible if you\u2019re using a hardware drum machine like an 808. So for a trap beat at 70 bpm, you would set your tempo at 140. Then each button on your 808 represents a thirty-second note rather than a sixteenth note, each pattern is only half a measure long, and snares go on beat three rather than on beats two and four. Here\u2019s a generic trap beat I made written in common time, with hi-hats on the thirty-second notes and snares on two and four.   And here\u2019s the same beat written in cut time, with the tempo doubled, hi-hats on the sixteenths, and snares on beat three. The two sound exactly the same; it\u2019s just a difference of how you\u2019re counting.   There are other stylistic differences between boom-bap and trap: funk and soul samples versus drum machines and synths, varying degrees of sixteenth note swing versus no swing at all, noisy/dirty versus clean/precise, and so on. But the main thing is the pulse.

Not as much 1/16th note action in boom Bap and triplets are pretty important to trap. ",
