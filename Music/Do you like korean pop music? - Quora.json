            "answer_text": "Yes, and we have pretty good reasons for that. (I listen to BTS and therefore i am going to answer this on that basis only) THE MUSIC VIDEOS - They don\u2019t really look like music videos but high definition movies. Unlike the western music videos their videos are not at all offensive and they don\u2019t portray or promote the use of drugs, addiction, offending women, etc. They follow certain strict rules regarding what they show in their music videos. They also don\u2019t use any graphic designing or fake stuff but those sets where the shooting is done is 99.99% real. The best example is FAKE LOVE, FIRE, - all the scenes whether the fire, the water, or the one with the floor falling into pieces, whole damn room blasted,sand everywhere, whatever you can imagine they do it.. Powerful right ?!!!THE LYRICS - They always write songs that the youth can relate to. Its one of the biggest reasons why they are on the top. Their lyrics are devoted to social messages, relevant issues, living a happy life, loving one self - which is one of the biggest issues in today\u2019s world. They motivate their listeners. Each song has a great meaning whether it is BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS, IDOL, LOVE MYSELF, NOT TODAY, FAKE LOVE, NO MORE DREAM, N.O., BLACK SWAN, ON, YOUNG FOREVER, HOUSE OF CARDS, TRUTH UNTOLD and the list can go on and on and on\u2026\u2026THE CHOREOGRAPHY - They have one of the best choreographies in the entire music industry , good dance is one of the things which you don\u2019t find in most of the western music videos and i am not lying. Many people say that its merely camerawork, but they prove everyone wrong during their live performances with their amazing synchronizations\u2026. That is a whole different level of synchronization..THE MUSIC - Their music is different from other artists . Their songs are refreshing and have the capability of changing your mood to a whole different level. Many a times you like a song and you end up listening to them like 100 times and after that you probably get bored of it but that\u2019s not the case with their songs\u2026. AGAIN , JUST SOME FACTS..FOR NOW I AM ONLY MENTIONING THESE 4 POINTS WHICH ARE THE BASIC HINTS OF WHY ANYONE WOULD LOVE TO LISTEN TO BTS. IF YOU DON\u2019T LIKE THEM ITS TOTALLY FINE CAUSE EVERYONE HAS A DIFFERENT TASTE. BUT I JUST GAVE YOU AN INSIGHT OF WHY WE LISTEN TO THEM\u2026 OTHER THAN BTS YOU CAN ALSO CHECK OUT TXT\u2026 THEY ARE ONE OF THE BEST ROOKIES SO FAR ..
