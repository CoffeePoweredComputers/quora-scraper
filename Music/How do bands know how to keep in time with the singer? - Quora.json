            "answer_text": "For the most part, the band plays together and the singer keeps in time with the band, or sings \u201caround\u201d the band\u2019s time - singing is often rather free, and they may go a little ahead or behind, but they are still aware of the timing of what is behind them. Sometimes the singer is momentarily alone, or the band has to meet the singer on a downbeat together. In that case, it\u2019s just a matter of listening and feeling the music together. It\u2019s part of being a musician. Also, it\u2019s one of the things that rehearsals are for. With a very large band, or an orchestra, there is usually a conductor to cue things visually. Even in a smaller band, people watch each other for cues - you can often tell by how someone\u2019s head moves what they are about to do. ",

            "answer_text": "If you watch closely, someone is 'leading' the band. If there's a drummer, the drummer frequently taps his sticks together to give a 'count in' for a measure, the '1-2-3-4' before the band comes in. The drummer is responsible to keep time. You will see the singer signal with their hands, body, instrument (if they are playing guitar or something) back to the drummer and the rest of the band. They are all paying close attention to each other. Sometimes the singer will turn around and face the other musicians, especially during a solo or freetime section, and clearly signal when they are returning to the head or chorus. When the singer raises his hand, the guitar neck, or even jumps up, that's to signal that the song is about to end when they bring their arm down or land (last big chord). ",
