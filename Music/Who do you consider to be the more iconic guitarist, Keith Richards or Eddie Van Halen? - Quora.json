            "answer_text": "Note: I thought I was answering an question comparing Hendrix and Eddie Vanhalen - clearly I must have had a brain feeeze - however the comments below do actually answer the question. Apologies. I\u2019ve left the answer up because its interesting anyway. :). Thanks. Stuart. This is not something you can really compare, but here goes: Hendrix did things with the guitar that nobody had ever seen before. Literally. Whilst Eddie brought finger tapping to the fore, he wasn\u2019t the first to do it. Emit Brown, a jazz player was the first in 1969. Hendrix was a great player. Eddie can do everything that Hendrix could do and was a great player 15 year later. I can do everything both of them can do, but that\u2019s nothing compared with the latest virtuosos now. There are 10 year old Chinese girls that are better technically than me. However, they have no musical touch. And thats the difference between people who learn feel for musicality and not. This begs the question as to what an iconic guitarist is. Is it necessarily technical ability (see 10 year olds being incredible guitarists on YouTube), or is it the ability to create and project emotion via your playing. After 42 years of playing, I have decided it\u2019s the latter, though it must be tempered with the ability to be able to be technically good when necessary. Therefore, I choose Hendrix as the most iconic. He literally created the heavy rock/blues genre. But as for technical pre-neoclassical (non jazz) guitar virtuosos are concerned, two guitarists were responsible for that and Eddie was one of them. The other was the late Randy Rhodes. Of course you can\u2019t forget the influence of amazing players like Gary Moore, who was playing serious rock/blues and jazz blues fusion in 1969 to 1976, blindingly fast and entirely responsible for the likes of Eddie et al. They were also iconic pioneers though they didn\u2019t get the credit they should have. In short. Hendrix wins, as they all owe their styles to him. ",

            "answer_text": "First off Kudos for not finishing with \u201cand why or why not\u201d that drives me mental. And to caveat my answer, you\u2019re asking for personal opinions: as such mine is likely to be at odds with most others, partly due to my own ignorance. For me, Eddie is the more iconic. Keith is an icon for sure but in my mind he\u2019s more of a pop culture icon: the indestructable, immortal, immovable object to Chuck Norris\u2019 unstoppable force.When I picture Eddie in my head I see him centre stage with those massive trousers and crazy guitar, shredding the shit out of it like the Rock icon he is. Even though I don\u2019t know a huge amount of VH\u2019s catalogue, I can \u2018hear\u2019 Eddie\u2019s sound to accompany the picture in my head. When I picture Keith, I don\u2019t hear guitar. Actually he\u2019s not even holding a guitar. He\u2019s staring down the camera into my soul with that tanned-leather sofa skin, crazy hair, ice cool, cigarette on the go. That might sound really disrespectful to one of the most influential members of influential bands in music history. It\u2019s not supposed to be. I\u2019m not trying to take away from his achievements. It\u2019s just how I see the two of them. ",
