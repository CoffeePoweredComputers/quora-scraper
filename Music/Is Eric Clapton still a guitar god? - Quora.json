            "answer_text": "Of course! During the 60\u2019s, whether he was with the Yardbirds, Cream, Delaney & Bonnie or solo, he brought electric blues guitar to a new level, motivating thousands of guitarists to play. At his age, with his health problems, he physically can\u2019t play like he could when younger, although that does not diminish his place in music history. Was, is, and always will be a guitar god.

            "answer_text": "I have nothing against Clapton or those who revere his guitar work. For me he never reached the level I would consider a 'guitar god'. While his playing his ok it doesn't cause me to react the way some other guitarists do. I saw him in concert with Carlos Santana, and there was no comparison. Clapton's playing lacked the emotion, or skill that Santana showed that evening. It could have been a bad night (everybody has one), but after many years of hearing his offerings I don't have a reason to question what I witnessed that evening. If asked I could give you a list of others I consider worthy of that title. ",
