            "answer_text": "Hi. Sad, emotional songs are intentionally made to attach itself onto a compatible person, and due to this reason, it feels very close to us. Let me ask you a question: What do a sad person need? My answer would be, for the purpose of alleviating the burden and pain, we will do either two of this common thing: Escapism - the less effective of the two, which require the person to direct is focus/attention/emotion to another direction. For example, Tom always evades the family reunion and find excuses for not being present, so that he will not remember the death of his beloved close cousin. Another example, just to get over the pain of being dumped, Anne will always be found in a 'stoned' or dazed condition, abusing multitudes of 'god knows what' substances. Usually this method is good for temporary respite, but not for the long haul.Sharing the pain - one of the Quorans answered with this famous tagline, 'misery loves a company' . It really is the most logical and viable answer for various reasons\u2026 Humans are mostly all social creatures (save for the introverted type that likes to keep everything bottled up inside - any reservoirs, no matter how big, will have it's maximum limit. This analogy clearly explain that this is not a healthy option to keep everything brewing storm inside your self on your own). Some people call this act selfish (sharing sadness), but most people call this act as an expression and responsibility of love. You might have noticed how popular a 'good listener' be in any social circle, right?Now, back to the original question: 'why do we tend to listen to emotional/sad songs, when we are already down/sad'? Specific emotional/sad songs that we love is like a close friend to us, because not only it always bring us down to memory lane, it also share the same vibes/characters as us (if you are in a certain age, say.. 45 to 60? Most of your choice of 'sad songs' might usually be ABBAs, Eagles, Simon Garfunkle or Don McLeans, I reckon?) And you know WHY it's so darn effective? The reason is, not only it (good emotional/sad songs) is a good psychological diversion that acts as a painkiller to escape the pain; it can also pose as a very close, loving friend that will always be there when you need a shoulder to cry on - repetition of this song all your life is a living proof that HE is! \u2026after all the violent storm eventually subsided and passed, you always know deep down, that everything is a tad better (all good, ev'thing will be all right!) after listening to your good'ol favourite sad song. The sun will shine again, and as you look at the freshly formed colourful rainbow over the jovial nimbus clouds accompanying the view, you'll perk yourself up, and brave on, as life will always go on. Peace out. ",

            "answer_text": "There could be multiple interpretations of this question. Here\u2019s my take : 1. Music that induces sadnessMusic is closely attached to our memories. It is human tendency to attach songs to their life fragments. Think of our mind as a painter and the memories as the paintings. The mind makes a sketch of every moment. In that sketch it includes everything that it can observe. If it observes certain music and a certain feeling, it\u2019ll sketch them together. Everyone has certain songs/music that induces a feeling of sadness in them. But why would anyone do that? There are two possible reasons. First and most common, they have no idea that the music is going to induce sadness. Second, some memories are so close to us, it doesn\u2019t matter if they are happy or sad and we choose to relive them. I, for instance, find it really helpful at times to relive the sad memories when I want to went some negativity out.2. Music that has lyrics which imply sadnessSadness is a complicated emotion and very tough to express in words. Probably that is the reason why humans cry. The sad songs, have to be written very carefully and a lot of thought has to be put into every word. You would find very few or probably no song that has sad but meaningless lyrics. So, people who are listening to try to make sense of the words, like to listen to such music. What I believe though, there is no such term as \u201cSad Music\u201d. Music is a piece of art. An art portrays the feelings which are open to interpretation and are only limited to the imagination of the one who perceives it. ",
