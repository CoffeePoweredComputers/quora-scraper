            "answer_text": "So first of all, and this may be a typo, I don\u2019t really believe you have a full octave lower than your vocal range. Usually you only have two or three notes unless you\u2019re really uncomfortable singing. Second, are you a guy gal or non binary pal? If you\u2019re female I don't want to call you a tenor. Though I doubt you are with the D3 in your range I have known women who can hit it. Gender changes what we call your voice type. For example a male alto or mezzo soprano is called a counter tenor. A female tenor or sometimes but very rarely baritone, is a contralto. Third, i\u2019m going to automatically assume E5-E6 is reachable but sounds terrible. With your head voice transition at E4 your range that sounds good probably ends somewhere around A4 maybe up to C5. So i\u2019m going to put the range used that sounds good at D2/3-A4. That gives you two and a half octaves instead of four and a major second. If you can hit D2, you're either a bass, or a baritone with a good low register. Basses typically bottom out around D2, while baritones typically bottom out around G2. The average high note from a bass is going to be E4, so you\u2019d still have a major fourth to go, which is not uncommon so bass is possible. If you\u2019re a baritone then you have an extra major 4th on the bottom plus a major second on top. I would say you\u2019re most likely somewhere in between. Because you can hit D2 you\u2019ll probably get stuck with the basses in choirs but your up range could cause you to be thrown into the baritones when needed. Now if D3 is your lowest note then the previous paragraph isn\u2019t true. C3 is the normal low range for a tenor B4 being the top. So it is possible you could be a tenor even going into your mixed voice at E4. If you\u2019re female then this would be a contralto. Now the difference between lyric or dramatic I cannot tell you. It really depends on too many things. How powerful is your voice? Does your high range actually sound as good as your comfortable range? Do you actually have a D2-E6 with all of your range sounding uniform across the board? If you have a powerful, grounded voice with the D2-E6 range you could be a heldenbaritone (sometimes hoher bass). It takes a lot of work to find your upper register and perfect it when you are but it is a possibility. In the end it\u2019s really impossible to know unless you sit down with someone who knows what they\u2019re doing and have them listen to you sing. I hope I have been helpful in some form of way. Have a nice day! (Rhyme unintended) ",
