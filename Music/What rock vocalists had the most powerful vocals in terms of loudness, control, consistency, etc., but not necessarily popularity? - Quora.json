            "answer_text": "Terry Reid is infamously the singer Jimmy Page wanted for Led Zeppelin. He was due to support the Rolling Stones & Cream, recommended Robert Plant to Page and the rest is history. He had a falling out with producer Mickie Most in 1969 and couldn\u2019t release anything for a while but \u2026 He\u2019s supported the greats, had his songs covered by many of them but never actually been one of them despite being a superlative vocalist. Terry Reid - Wikipedia  Superlungs My Supergirl But now for something different;  We are 138 Some may not see through the schlock horror lyrics and visual presentation of the band but from the outset Glenn Danzig\u2019s voice is the secret weapon of the Misfits. He has good vocal control, a nice deep baritone, vocal projection and a powerful bellow of a voice.  Hollywood Babylon The Misfits may have sold 5m records tops and most of those after the band first disbanded. Danzig is a vocalist who outclasses many in far bigger bands but would the world be a better place? Few have his dark obsessions, a zombie Elvis from an urban swamp, he fits perfectly with the Misfits. ",
