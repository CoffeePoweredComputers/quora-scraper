            "answer_text": "I addressed this question in my answer to Pop Music: What is the longest song title of a contemporary hit song? There are two possible answers. In 1981, a studio group called Starsound tried to capitalize on the last remaining days of disco by releasing a disco medley of Beatles songs and other 1960s hit. Although the song is commonly called Stars on 45, it's full title is \"Medley: Intro Venus / Sugar Sugar / No Reply / I'll Be Back / Drive My Car / Do You Want to Know a Secret / We Can Work It Out / I Should Have Known Better / Nowhere Man / You're Going to Lose That Girl / Stars on 45.\" The song got all the way to #1 on the Billboard Top 40. Even if you removed all the spaces and punctuation from the title, the title would still be 155 characters long, making it one of the few songs whose title could not fit in a single \"tweet\" on Twitter. (Note: I first wrote this answer when tweets were limited to 140 characters.) If you're interested, here's a hissy 45 of the song playing on YouTube:  If we don't count medleys, then the longest title of a song to hit the Top 40 is \"Jeremiah Peabody's Poly Unsaturated Quick Dissolving Fast Acting Pleasant Tasting Green And Purple Pills\" by the country & western novelty act Ray Stevens. That title is 90 letters long with 104 characters if you include spacing and punctuation. That song hit #35 on the Billboard Top 40 in 1961, providing Stevens with his first commercial hit. Ray Stevens even has his own YouTube channel, where he has a cute little animation of himself performing the song:  ",
