            "answer_text": "In a literal sense, this is not possible. However, if one were to simply transcribe a person\u2019s speech, much of the meaning would be lost. Non-verbal communication, such as the expression on the person\u2019s face, posture, gesturing, etc. provide important information about the emotional context of the message. The person\u2019s tone of voice provides additional information about the person\u2019s emotional state. When people started to discover text-based online communication years ago, they quickly noticed that not being able to hear or see the person on the other end greatly hampered communications. Often, it could be difficult to tell whether people in these forums were intending to be taken literally or if they were making jokes. It was hard to tell when people were upset, annoyed, frustrated, etc., unless they specifically mentioned it. An ad-hoc language of faces (\u201csmilies\u201d) drawn using punctuation marks developed to fill this need for an emotional shorthand. Another important technique is understanding the context behind what the person is saying, or \u201creading between the lines.\u201d Is the remark atypical for the person, based on prior knowledge of the person\u2019s personality? Is the remark unusual, based on circumstances? Taken as a whole, do the person\u2019s remarks and body language seem to be intended to give clues to a deeper message? ",

We could also pose questions that include certain controls to elicit what most people would include in any response, and open-ended inquiries calculated to elicit variable information. Then we pay attention to their answers. Also, if we encounter someone who has a puffy red face and eyes, instead of asking if they've been crying, we can ask if we can get them an allergy pill or decongestant. If they say they don't have a cold or allergies, they're probably crying. No need to ask. ",

I have read something very interesting which basically explained that the body and the mind state can rapidly influence each other. There cannot be an imbalance between them, they have to be \u201con the same page\u201d. Yes, many people know how to hide their feeling but if you pay attention, at some point their body will show you what is truly going on. ",
