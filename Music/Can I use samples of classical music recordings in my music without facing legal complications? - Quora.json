            "answer_text": "We need to be very careful of the difference between samples and examples. If you mean sampling in the technical sense of using a clip of somebody else\u2019s recording and incorporating a recording of that clip in your own piece, then no. Someone will own the rights to that recording - the record company, possibly the conductor and orchestra who performed it. And in the case of opera or choral work, living singers who would have strong views about their work being sampled and used for a different performance. You can use out-of-copyright music. Provided it is an original performance, by you or by musicians you have contracted for the recording/performance. That will not mean all \u201cclassical music\u201d. In most jurisdictions copyright lasts until 70 years after the composer\u2019s death. William Walton\u2019s music is copyrighted until 2053. Benjamin Britten until 2046. Richard Strauss (\u201cAlso Sprach Zarathustra\u201d etc) was copyrighted until last September\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "To use a sample legally, you need two separate licenses: one for the audio recording itself, and one for the underlying composition. All the canonical masterpieces from before 1900 are in the public domain, so you\u2019d be fine as far as the underlying composition goes. But you still have to negotiate a license with the owner of the recording that you\u2019re sampling (typically the record label, Sony Classical or Deutsche Grammophon or whoever it is.) ",

You cannot use a pre-existing recording though, even if the music copyright is long over like for any Bach or Mozart piece. ",
