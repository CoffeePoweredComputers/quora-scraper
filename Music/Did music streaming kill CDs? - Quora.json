            "answer_text": "No. I still buy them. But it did kill the longevity in underground genres and the need/desire to purchase hard copies. For example, a fourth or 5th tier developing metal band has a limited time to move up and start making enough money to start to not to have to work a day job. I know lots of cats that tour domestic and international that have multiple albums out that still work day jobs. A lot of bands now break up because there just isnt any more longevity in the business. I know of great bands that quit or great players because after awhile it costs more money and time to do it than it's worth to do. Why should I take 3 months off a year to tour and finance a recording to live in a crappy apartment I can barely afford? Illegal downloads and streaming killed that because the album sales aren't there anymore. Just my opinion. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Music piracy did. Music streaming is really just a least-worst option to bring some kind of revenue into the industry after P2P networks crashed sales. Initially the major labels and publishers were very reluctant to buy into streaming, because the royalties were so bad. For many years GAMA, the German performing right society, refused to allow its members\u2019 material to be hosted on YouTube at all. But as it became clear that there was a choice between little or nothing, they reluctantly came around to the idea. ",
