            "answer_text": "Everyone will have their own answer, as the question can only be answered subjectively. Factually, there is no single one 'best voice', male or female, any more than there is a single one 'best human being'.Just like humans as a whole, every voice has its natural strengths, which come at the price of other strengths which someone else's voice will have, who in turn are weaker in aspects that the first singer has. And no artist is ever complete, even if many are very accomplished. I will throw in - from popular music at large - in no particular order:  Male singers: George Michael (purity/beauty of sound), Stevie Wonder (fantastic range and awesome soul !), Elvis Presley (beautiful timbre and feel) (Freddie Mercury - already mentioned; awesome rock power), Chris Isaak (beauty of tone); David Phelps (in my view, one of the most accomplished vocal 'technicians', as well as great feeling; I cannot help admiring him, even if I'm not religious), Daryl Hall (fantastically accomplished in both technique and delivery), Michael McDonald (love that haunting timbre and soul), and I could find tons more, as many 'have something' vocally, that I find special and enjoyable. Talking purely heavy metal: I would put up Bruce Dickinson in the top spot. But there have been tons more very accomplished, highly skilled singers especially in heavy metal.  Female singers: (Aretha Franklin - already mentioned; unbeatable soul !!), Whitney Houston in her prime (voice as gorgeous as the woman herself; she 'had it all' as a pop star, in my view), Ella Fitzgerald (a true thorough-bred singing musician with an excellent voice; listen to her if you want to know what vocal jazz can be), and again, tons more that I can't think of right now.  I personally also find Bob Dylan's voice beautiful... ",

I base this on their various vocal abilities\u2014some of them have range or power, some can handle multiple styles (sweet and gentle or raw and angry), some have a strong ability to convey emotion (whether it\u2019s goosebumps or a gut-punch). A few have more than one of these qualities. These are in no particular order\u2014 MALE:Ronnie James Dio (Rainbow, DIO, but especially his brief time in Black Sabbath)Chris Cornell (Soundgarden, Audioslave, Temple of the Dog)Freddy Mercury (Queen)Thom Yorke (Radiohead)Andy Yorke (Unbelieveable Truth)Brad Delp (Boston)Jimmy Gnecco (Ours)Jeremy Enigk (Sunny Day Real Estate, The Fire Theft)Ian Anderson (Jethro Tull)Scott Weiland (Stone Temple Pilots, Velvet Revolver)Midge Ure (Ultravox)Steve Hogarth (Marillion)Matthew Bellamy (Muse)Bono (U2) FEMALE:Ann Wilson (Heart)Pat BenatarLzzy Hale (Halestorm)Tori AmosAnneke Van Giersbergen (The Gathering, Agua de Annique)Sharon den Adel (Within Temptation)Juliana Hatfield (Blake Babies)Katie ReiderSkin (Skunk Anansie)Storm LargeKristin Hersh (Throwing Muses) These lists do not include some of my favorite singers (Geddy Lee of Rush; Steve Walsh of Kansas), or some of the most popular singers (Robert Plant; Mick Jagger; any of the Beatles), because I don\u2019t think they meet the criteria I set above.
