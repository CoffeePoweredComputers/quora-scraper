            "answer_text": "Rakim. If you aren\u2019t a hardcore golden age hip-hop fanboy (and I\u2019m not) you likely have no clue who he is.  No other rapper had such an extreme effect on the entire genre. There is rap before Rakim, and rap after Rakim. Before Ra, single-syllable, basic rhymes, and lines with a maximum of six words were the norm. \u201cMy name is Bob and rap is my job,\u201d was about the deepest a track ever went. When The Notorious B.I.G, considered by some as the father of modern rap, was six years old, Rakim was already performing under the moniker of \u201cKid Wizard.\u201d He was revolutionary, his true gift for lyricism showing though. He combined with DJ and producer Eric B. and catapulted into the spotlight. His flow, rhyming ability, and technical lyricism revolutionized hip-hop. When everyone else was still rapping Beastie Boys style with simple lyrics and single-syllable rhymes, Rakim was using complex rhyme schemes with five-syllable words. I got, the range, better, stay in the slow lane. I make the flow change from hurricanes to a slow rain. Thoughts are so plane, I rearrange the whole frame. Until my whole name grow out your brain like Rogaine. His music was well-received, leaving an audience clamoring for more. Rakim released more albums with Eric B, each one reaching the top of every hip-hop chart. His style singlehandedly changed the face of rap. Nearly every famous rapper directly credits Rakim as an inspiration. Hell, one of Eminem\u2019s most popular songs, Rap God included an homage to Rakim, and his role in Em\u2019s success. Even the rappers who don\u2019t directly credit Rakim with their success (Others that did include Tupac, Biggie, Wu-Tang Clan, and other rap legends) needed him to make the change in hip-hop for them to succeed. He brought the art a quantum leap forward. He deserves to be recognized among the greatest of all time. Most fans today don\u2019t even know his name. Rakim is the forgotten Mozart of rap, a genius who changed the entire genre. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the most underrated rapper alive today has to be Logic. Logic has some of the best talent that ive heard in all of hip hop. If he wasnt making meaningful albums he would have already blown up.Logic\u2019s first talent is speed. He isn\u2019t known for it, but he definatly shows it in a few verses. For example in \u201cGang Related\u201d, he has an extremely fast second verse.  Logic\u2019s second main talent is rapping about real topics. Unlike most rappers, almost all of Logic\u2019s songs are about real topics like Anziety (about battle with Anxiety), 1800 (about many people\u2019s battle with suicide, Welcome to Forever (about his come up from being poor and it being cereal), and many other examples.    Logics third main talent is his fan base and relateability. Logic is married and does alot of normal things, not buy gold chains. Logic is also a self proclaimed \u201cnerd\u201d, playing video games and solving rubiks cubes. This obviously makes him have a different fan base. Logics last and forth main talent is sampling. Logic samples some of the most random songs, but really knows how to make rap beats out of them. For example, Young Sinatra, samples Nas\u2019s , Lifes a Bitch. This video shows exactly what I\u2019m talking about.  In conclusion, Logic is the most underrated rapper alive. ",
