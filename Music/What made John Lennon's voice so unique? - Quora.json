            "answer_text": "John Lennon not only used different vocal techniques from song to song, he changed the way he sang within each song. Here are a few examples to show you what I mean. John\u2019s fairly high, bright \u201chead\u201d voice made him easy to hear and understand on the radio, and the many nights singing in Hamburg nightclubs gave his voice power. On \u201cI Wanna Hold Your Hand,\u201d he starts off within normal speaking range, but strong enough to cut through the driving beat. His voice goes lower, almost naughty, for the words, \u201cI think you understand.\u201d Then he goes back up to normal range before hitting the almost feminine higher notes, \u201c\u2026hold your hand.\u201d John changes his tone throughout the following lines, where he sings the title twice with a flourish, somewhat showy but also reassuring. Less talented vocalists would sing the song as simply happy lines, but in a short period of time John has been alternately vulnerable and brazen, while always in control of the story. He\u2019s not singing \u201cat\u201d the song. You feel that he is telling a real story and connecting with the listener. Another great example of John using the top and bottom of his range is on \u201cJust Like Starting Over.\u201d The ballad \u201cGirl\u201d presents John as a worldly guy telling us about a woman he desires but who is frustrating him. His voice is sharp, nasal, and clinical, as if he\u2019s going to verbally pick the girl apart. \u201cShe promises the earth to me\u2026,\u201d but he suddenly turns tender with his breathy voice, \u201c\u2026and I believe her.\u201d The one-word chorus is a lustful sigh - \u201cAh, girl\u2026\u201d - followed by a dirty breath in. He sounds even more angry at the girl in the bridge (\u201cShe\u2019s the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there\u2026\u201d), but soon he works himself up into passion as he repeats, \u201cShe\u2019s cool, ooh, ooh,\u2026,\u201d before releasing again into the sighs of, \u201cGirl\u2026\u201d You can hear a more explosive example of this alternating tension in the song \u201cI\u2019m So Tired.\u201d John had conflicting feelings about his fame. Sometimes he wanted the ability to disappear, to blend in with the crowd, but other times he felt he needed to use his platform to make big statements. This inner conflict came to a head on his solo song, \u201cGod.\u201d He sounds conversational, but his words are the beginning of his big statement, \u201cGod is a concept by which we measure our pain.\u201d He then says, \u201cI\u2019ll say it again,\u201d and sure enough, to underline his theme, he repeats the line. From here he gets increasingly insistent, his voice torn and worn, as he casts away his mysticism and idols \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t believe in magic, I don\u2019t believe in I Ching,\u2026\u201d until he says, with gentle force but with the scratch of well-earned wisdom, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in Beatles.\u201d His voice is gentle as a feather throughout the last section, \u201cI was the Walrus, but now I\u2019m John\u2026the dream is over.\u201d Whether or not you feel John was justified in his feeling of self-importance, he drew you into his world. It\u2019s what makes \u201cBeautiful Boy\u201d an astonishingly intimate song. Even more than his song-writing skills, it was John\u2019s ability turn bare all through his voice is what made his so loved by his fans. ",

            "answer_text": "What makes anyone\u2019s voice unique? Look at people like Joe Cocker or Leon Russell as well as many singers. Everyone is born with a voice of their own, some are very generic and sound like many other singers while some are blessed with a voice that is uniquely their own. As already mentioned John hated the sound of his own voice and constantly had George Martin add effects to his tracks. He even used a Leslie cabinet on Tomorrow Never Knows and still his voice comes through as John Lennon. Even though he constantly tried to cover up his voice it was easy to tell who was singing. This was even more apparent as he got older. I have been a singer for more than 40 years and I too hated my voice and tried to sing a cover song trying to sound like the original artist. When I sang songs I wrote I would try to use a voice that was not really mine as well. Our lead guitarist finally said just use your own voice and so in practice i did and he told me that he liked my voice much better than the fake voices I had been using. I think this is common for many singers and John was no exception. The slightly nasal sound and the accent as well as the way he approached a song made his voice not only unique but memorable. While Paul had a smoother and more melodic voice John\u2019s voice was always edgy and in your face. ",

            "answer_text": "Listening to the Beatles now after all these years as a professional musician I think it\u2019s largely in the timing. It seems to me their music was vocal driven - even the drums accompanied the rhythmic drive that came from the vocals, especially Lennon\u2019s. Nowadays all music is drum or bass driven, and nearly always the vocals are added last. This means the vocals have to work around the inflexibility of a pre-recorded rhythm track. This is particularly apparent whenever you hear the music in the background, say in a shop or somewhere. The fidelity of the sound doesn\u2019t really compare to modern recordings, and in that situation you might not be able to hear the bass at all, and no more than a sizzle from the hi hat - yet it\u2019s the rhythm of the vocals that give it that edge and still renders their music supreme. The other particular quality that was always extraordinary about Lennon was how well his voice blended with McCartney\u2019s, even though their voices were very different. On early tracks like \u2018Misery\u2019, when they sang together they almost sounded like one person double tracked. ",

It is true that John's voice sounds rather nasal and his voice range is rather limited compared to Paul McCartney, but his voice is still versatile. John could do any other styles of vocal such as primal scream style vocal, psychedelic style vocal, ballad style vocal, rock n roll style of vocal, and even pop style vocal. ",

Power plus attitude equals unique. Add to that as a Lucky Strike Extra - this is true for all four mop tops - the Liverpudlian Scouse of the time. ",
