It a pleasant feeling wearing your headphones , listening to your favorite songs and enjoying the beauty of nature while completing the journey. I have a ton of songs but I\u2019ll just list the ones related to the question.  5 Seconds Of Summer - Youngblood  Coldplay - A Sky Full Of Stars  ILLENIUM, Jon Bellion - Good Things Fall Apart  Lost Sky - Dreams pt. II (feat. Sara Skinner)  The Chainsmokers - Don't Let Me Down Whenever I play these songs it takes my mind to those beautiful sceneries on the way to my village. This is kind of my way to recall memories. ",
