Listening is a skill that few people actually use. Conversely, people truly value a good listener\u2026however, never seek to become one, themselves. I have successfully navigated my way out of many gatherings of people who clamor for my personal information\u2026only to be derailed by me, flipping the question to them, and using my active listening skills. They get so lost in hearing their own voices, that I escape without ever answering their questions. People are funny creatures. When you do find someone that is good at listening, value that person!

            "answer_text": "Because people like to show general interest in what you have to say it\u2019s like a formality they have to complete but realistically they don\u2019t actually want to hear your life problems or even have any interest in them, this is because everyone believes their problems are bigger then others. To be honest, this isn\u2019t everyone there are souls out there that will listen and be a shoulder of support but the ones that do as you stated are generally self-absorbed and not truly good people as life is all about sharing out the burden of problems especially within our individual social bubbles otherwise the pressure of life can become overbearing and often leads to people committing suicide.
