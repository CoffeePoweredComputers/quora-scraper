            "answer_text": "Hey there! Yes, Sadie Hawkins dances are girls\u2019 choice \u2014 so we\u2019d typically be asking whoever we\u2019d like to go with, instead of the other way around. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s an enforced rule, any more than dressing up on spirit days is mandatory. It\u2019s simply a fun twist on regular school dances, where girls are encouraged to do the asking! My old high school never had one, which is a shame because I think it would\u2019ve been a great idea. My current one is actually having one tomorrow \u2014 but as a slightly awkward new kid, I don\u2019t have any friends to go with, or romantic interests. If your school is having one, definitely try it out! ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it's less of a rule and more of a tradition. At some schools it's called the Sadie Hawkins dance, and yes, the girls are supposed to ask the boys. This isn't a rule, though. Traditionally, boys ask girls to dances, so this was started as an opportunity for girls to choose their dates. I believe most boys would avoid asking a girl to a girls\u2019 choice event. I've seen that a number of girls do end up asking guys, though most still don't feel comfortable with it. And regular dances are seeing more girls asking guys than before. (This girls\u2019/boys\u2019 choice thing isn't particularly useful or inclusive for queer couples either.) I haven't personally asked anyone, mostly because I didn't attend school dances until this year, and my school cancelled the Sadie\u2019s dance because of low turnout. ",
