            "answer_text": "Whenever I am down I listen to \"What a wonderful world\" by Louis Armstrong (musician). Despite all that is horribly wrong with the world today, this songs helps put things in perspective. There are a lot fucked up today but then again, there's a lot that is good and beautiful.   The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the skyAre also on the faces of people going byI see friends shaking handsSaying, \"How do you do?\"They're really saying, \"I love you.\"   And then there is Somewhere Over the Rainbow by Israel \"IZ\" Kamakawiwo'ole.    Other songs that never fail to cheer me up are: Iris (Goo Goo Dolls): I first fell in love with this track in the movie \"City of Angels\".  And then there is this live version where it started to rain during the concert.  Your hand in mine (Explosions in the Sky): The band that got me into post-rock, EitS has an ethereal sound and they manage to touch every point on the emotional spectrum during the course of a song. Which is even more impressive, considering that there are no lyrics. Fast car (Tracy Chapman): A song about moving away, to a new place, a new life. Hey ya! (Outkast; cover by The Blanks): Scrubs is my favorite TV series and this cover by The Blanks (aka Ted's Band) really nailed it. Kyun (Barfi!): The song's about insouciance, about saying yes to every adventure, and embarking on the journey called life. Phir le aaya dil (Barfi) Fix you (Coldplay): There is something reassuring when someone says that they \"will be there to fix you\". Hotel California (Eagles): One of the greatest songs ever written, no one really knows for sure what the song signifies. But you can clearly see the imagery - a dark night, a desert highway, an inn in the middle of nowhere.  Mr Tambourine Man (Bob Dylan): Hey ! Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to Hey ! Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you. Or anything by Death Cab for Cutie (Transatlanticism - full album (seamlessly looped)",

It cheers me up big time.  2 If I\u2019m feeling down down because of a shock or a surprise, I listen to a song which gives me a good advice and has a good beat to it \u201cBreathe\u201d by Seeb  3 If I\u2019m unsure, or afraid, and I need the \u201820 seconds of insane courage\u2019, I listen to this : \u201cRead All About It\u201d by Emeli Sande  4 If I\u2019m not in a good mood because of some work that I\u2019ve been avoiding or procrastination, I listen to \u201cBaby\u201d by Justin Bieber. This makes me turn off my cellphone/ Walkman, get on my ass and do things!  ",

Keith's song is about a guy in a bar watching a woman being mistreated by her man, Keith is essentially giving her advice when he sees how upset she is. Also listening to the long guitar solo by Eric Clapton in LAY DOWN SALLY takes me to a better place. DON'T BRING ME DOWN - ELO Electric Light Orchestra BOB MARLEY - COULD YOU BE LOVED, SATISFY MY SOUL BERES HAMMOND - THEY GONNA TALK. Its amazing how many people feel blue but get better by helping others which gives them a lift taking their minds of their own problems. music does the same thing in that it really can lift you out of a rut. SOME SONGS HAVE A SAD ELEMENT TO THEM BUT CONTAIN SOLUTIONS. REGGAE MUSIC IS FULL OF SONGS WITH REMEDIES & UPLIFTING POSITIVE MESSAGES THAT TOTALLY PUT ME IN A GOOD ZONE. GOOD LUCK TO YOU. ",

My taste in music is quite varied but I usually hate pop songs, my favourite bands are Radiohead and Red Hot Chili Peppers, so there's an idea of my taste. So the songs I'm about to mention I would class as guilty pleasures. Please keep this to yourself and please please please don't judge me!! Take That - Never Forget & Back For GoodCarly Rae Jepsom(sp) - Call Me MaybeJason Derulo (when you read his name you MUST sing it!) - TrumpetsMcFly - StargirlRhianna - We Found LoveOne Direction - That's What Makes You BeautifulNoah & the Whale - Five Years Time They all make me smile from ear-to-ear!! There are probably hundreds of other guilty pleasures but that's all I can think of now!! Another favourite, one that I'm not ashamed of (ha!) is Chandelier by Sia. I think it's wonderful and although it doesn't put me in a great mood instantly I find it inspiring. I'm a writer and when I need something emotional for a story or article or scene I listen to Chandelier and immediately know what to write. If you haven't heard any of these, give them a go and then tell me what you think. Or comment with any guilty pleasures you may have!! I'd love to hear them. ",

            "answer_text": "A song that most people don't even know has lyrics. I'm pretty grateful to whoever wrote this question because for years I loved this one piano melody they'd play on the radio from time to time, entirely instrumental. Then, one day, I was walking through a store in Germany and heard the song being played with lyrics in the piped music coming in over the speakers. For several years afterwards I asked lots of people who knew music better than me (not hard to do, not my forte) if they knew the lyrics of where I could find them. Everyone said there are no lyrics. I knew better because I'd heard them. Fast forward 30 years, and thanks to the great internet and this question I've finally found them. Here it is, the one song that always instantly puts me in a good mood as an instrumental, and now, finally, also with the lyrics. Music Box Dancer (edit - new video, old video was replaced)  Oh, and I'm not certain, but I think this is the instrumental version that first got me hooked on the song.  One final interesting tidbit, at that time in Germany, 1980, music boxes made with wood from the black forest were extremely popular, especially in the store I was in on that great day when I finally learned that the happy music had words.

When I was about 4 years old my dad would turn off all the lights in the house. He would light a couple candles for dramatic effect and so we could see each other laughing and smiling. Then \u201cDancing in the Dark\u201d would blast at full volume, filling every room in the house. My mom, my little brother, my father and I would start dancing about with glee to the lyrics. Then my dad would take me in me in his arms and throw me up into the air as high as he could and catch me safely, and I would shriek with amusement and giggle uncontrollably. We were terrible dancers, jerking and bopping about like fish on the sand. But it didn't matter in my house. This moment comes over me, every time I hear this track, to this day. My mom tells me that she has he has never seen anyone as smitten and spellbound by love, as my dad was with me around that age. He adored me and would do anything to make me smile. Therefore, \u201cDancing in the Dark\u201d not only makes me move my feet, but it fills with gratitude that I have been blessed to be raised by such loving and fun parents. I got to recreate the dance at my wedding, and we all smiled just as brightly.  Picture of me hugging my dad super tight at my wedding. ",

The song is Bobby McFerrin's \"Don't Worry, Be Happy,\" and my response to it is not based on the lyrics (called \"simplistic\" and \"delusional\") but on the quality of its musical invention. For me, it not only induces a feeling of well-being the way some Mozart pieces do, but it delights my mind in tracking the subtleties of the vocal line and the creation of the accompaniment entirely from body percussion. I don't hear it often, but when I do come across it, I am always delighted. And now I'm going to depart the halls of Quora for a little while so that the hail can fall where it will. I'm going to have a cocktail, and maybe even listen to a certain #1 song. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cNever Too Far Gone\u201d by Jordan Feliz. The lyrics are supposed to be God, speaking to His beloved child. The words resonate with my spirit, because so many times in my walk with Christ, I've felt that I've indeed, \u201cbeen too far gone\" when I've drifted from Him. Or that I don't deserve His love and acceptance. But when reading His word and praying, He always reassures me that I'm not ever too far away that He can't reach me. That even though I fail Him everyday, His love for me will never stop! Hell never take it away! He forgives me all day long, and will love me forever! The song reminds of how deep His love is for His children really is. Ive included the lyrics below, so take a look at them and see if you've ever felt that way, or thought those thoughts. I know I have from time to time--and the Holy Spirit never fails to lead me back. All praise, honor and glory to you Father!  \u201cI have loved you from the startI have seen your hurting heart And you feel so lonely, but you keep on hiding'Cause you feel so guilty for what you've done, butThere's no distance too far, that I can't reach youThere's no place that's so dark, that I can't find youAnywhere that you are, if you need proofTake a look at these scars, and know I love youDoesn't matter, doesn't matter, doesn't matter what you've doneYou are never, you are never, never too far gone ====== You have run down every roadAnd you've lost your way back home And you feel so dirty you know you're unworthyFeeling undeserving of any love, butThere's no distance too far, that I can't reach youThere's no place that's so dark, that I can't find youAnywhere that you are, if you need proofTake a look at these scars, and know I love youDoesn't matter, doesn't matter, doesn't matter what you've doneYou are never, you are never, never too far gone You will never outrun my love, my love, my loveYou will never outrun my love, my love, my love\u201d ",

But this is one song that seems to ease the tension, quell the anger, and make me breathe easy again. This, my favorite rendition, is especially magical. For a song of such serene simplicity, it feels like it has infinite levels of power. It embodies dreams, memories, love, and loss. It's an experience. The human experience. It has life all wrapped up in it. The good, the bad, the past, the future. It's truly humbling. It makes me feel like my troubles are but a passing eddy in an ever flowing river. ",

Sometimes when i feel kinda bored, i listen to some heavy metal (Cigaro by SOAD, or Awaken by Deathklok) to lift up things. But it's different when i get writer's block (it's awful especially if you are an architect in need of ideas), i usually listen to fast paced jazz (like Moaning by Charles Mingus) or classical music (Hall of The Mountain Kings or Overture kinda do the work). But when i'm working, in order to maintain my focus, i like to listen to slow paced classic, folk song, or blues (House of Rising Sun - The Animals or Times They're A-changing by Bob Dylan). If what i feel is in need of escape, all i want to listen to is pop songs or rock or alternative (songs from Grouplove, Peach Pit, Varsity) or sometimes songs from Cage the Elephant, especially the ones from Unpeeled Ps: I'm so sorry if I put the genre wrong, because i dont have a particular genre to listen to and usually i can't differentiate genres like death metal or heavy metal. Again, sorry hehe ",

This song is composed by A.R Rehman and the lyrics is beautiful,liberating one from the stress of daily work.Javed akhtar as a lyricist has put the philosophy of life in simple but insightful words. Its a song about journey of life and what makes a person happy.  Jeevan mai preet hai , hoton pe geet hai bas yeh hi jeet hai , sun le rahi   Another song worth mentioning is  Lazarus by procupine tree. Steven wilson's voice and music are soothing. The song is about hope. To me, it sounds like a \"personal resurrection\" just like lazarus.   ",

It's just so light and fun! Alive Again - Chicago Chicago Alive Again I always play this track before cross country meets and tennis matches. It always gets me in the mood to go out and compete!

The singing is superb and the band\u2019s playing is totally mesmerising, it\u2019s just that good. The album is about the delight of finding new love. If I had to go for one song off the album I\u2019d choose A Free Man In Paris which she wrote about music label owner David Geffen. The track epitomises the light, jazzy feel of the album. ",

You see, it came to me It put its face up to my face so I could see Yeah then I saw love disfigure me Into something I am not recognizing See, the cage, it called. I said, \"Come on in\" I will not open myself up this way again Nor lay my face to the soil, nor my teeth to the sand I will not lay like this for days now upon end You will not see me fall, nor see me struggle to stand To be acknowledged by some touch from his gnarled hands You see, the cage, it called. I said, \"Come on in\" I will not open myself up this way again You see, the moon is bright in that treetop night I see the shadows that we cast in the cold, clean light My feet are gold. My heart is white And we race out on the desert plains all night See, honey, I am not some broken thing I do not lay here in the dark waiting for thee No my heart is gold. My feet are light And I am racing out on the desert plains all night So some say love is a burning thing That it makes a fiery ring Oh but I know love as a caging thing Just a killer come to call from some awful dream O and all you folks, you come to see You just stand there in the glass looking at me But my heart is wild. And my bones are steam And I could kill you with my bare hands if I was free\ufeff. ",

He is none other than Armin van Buuren. And the song's name is This Is What It Feels Like. I had listened to this song, once when I was feeling low. This song instantly put me back to good mood. And I was back to my work within no time. Here's the link to its YouTube video:  I hope you enjoy this song. :) PS: Listen to this song with your headphones/earphones on, and a good enough volume, so that you'll completely get to feel the magic behind its refreshing music. :) ",

This genre usually has a bad reputation, but it is all based on mostly untrue stereotypes. The music is energetic, passionate and if you read the lyrics, super deep and meaningful. This type of music motivates me and gives me energy. Contrary to belief, it is not angry or depressing music (some of it can be, but not all). You can hear the music has soul and the artist has suffered and music is best when it is authentic enough for others to relate to it and feel the emotions. Besides this if I need energy in the mornings or when exercising, I listen to Hardstyle EDM music. The fast paced beats increase my heart rate, gives me energy and the inspiring lyrics makes me feel happy. ",
