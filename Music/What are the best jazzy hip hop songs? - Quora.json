            "answer_text": "There are lots of different specific songs that could be recommended but if you want more generalized answers here are a few suggestions.  Kendrick Lamar's \"To Pimp a Butterfly.\" Described as one of the most afro-centric albums in decades, TPAB combines Jazz, Soul, Funk and Hip-Hop into one great cohesive fusion album. Great horns, great basslines, a great time. Best tracks: Wesley's Theory, For Free?, For Sale?, King Kunta.Kendrick Lamar's \"untitled unmastered.\" Unused tracks from the TPAB sessions with just as much Jazz, if not more. Best tracks: untitled 01, untitled 02, untitled 06.A Tribe Called Quest's ... Basically their entire discography. To start I would recommend \"The Low End Theory.\" Some great songs include \"Jazz\" and \"Vibes and Stuff.\"De La Soul's \"3 Feet High and Rising.\" A classic record that is mainly sample based but has a lot of Jazz influence. Be sure to check out \"Change in Speak\" and \"Potholes in My Lawn.\"Kids These Day's \"Traphouse Rock.\" This album has a little less of an emphasis on Jazz but it is certainly thrown into the mix on this excursion from the norm. Best tracks: A Man's Medley, Bud Billiken, Doo-Wah.I hope you enjoy some of these suggestions! There is a Hip-Hop song for everyone.  ",

I think you will enjoy these tracks a lot. Soulchef is a great producer  Nieve makes good tracks with that feel  A lot of the 49er\u2019s songs have that feel too  Cradle orchestra also makes good jazz influenced hip hop tracks  Common Market is one of my favorite groups. Not really jazz, but definitely feel good.  GOWE also makes good Jazz influenced tracks. In this one he spat over Nujabes\u2019s Araurian Dance track.  Here are some of the artists you should consider looking into: Nujabes Soulchef Incise Nieve Cradle Orchesta Cj Trillo The Sound Providers Shad Blu & Exile Common Market Cyne Gowe ",
