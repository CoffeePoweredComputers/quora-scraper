            "answer_text": "Easy. I would simply use ProTools, and splice it all together. I think there\u2019s still a free version of ProTools available. Also, I think you can get it as a free trial and just do what you need to do during the trial period. Another alternative I\u2019ve used for quick editing tasks is Audacity, which is free. There are probably a few other options in the free or low cost range, and, of course, Logic, or Digital Performer, or Cubase, etc. Hope that helps. ",
