            "answer_text": "AMAZING!!!! Although I do hate how Miley and Lana stans are so ungrateful. Especially Lana fans. What they don\u2019t understand is that the song was offered to Ariana and she asked for them to be on the song. Why not just be happy with what they gave? The song\u2019s amazing. My favourite parts come from Ariana and Miley but Lana\u2019s was just so\u2026.. shaking and chilling and gave it a whole new vibe. I really love the song. The way their voices all blend flawlessly together and how they all look stunning in the video. It\u2019s my favourite song right now and it deserves all the praise it\u2019s been receiving. ",
