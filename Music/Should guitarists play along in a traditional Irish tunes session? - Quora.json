            "answer_text": "Generally if it's a session, it means it's an open and participatory event so people can bring a bassoon if they like, there's no issue there. So from that perspective, certainly usually yes. When you say \u201cplay along\u201d it can mean two things. One is to listen to what others are doing and fiddle around finding things to play that seem to fit. That's perfectly acceptable when done unobtrusively and is a great way to learn - both for novice players and for existing guitarists coming over to Irish from other styles. Guitarists who know what they're doing in Irish music can make a great contribution to the tune, playing an actual part in the piece and helping to make it what it is. The role of a guitar in Irish is not the same as in rock, blues or jazz and it takes some time to get into what a good guitarist should add. An interesting thing that distinguishes trad folk music from the styles mentioned above is that in many styles the chords are the basis and the melody is an addition and sometimes highly variable and improvised, whereas in folk the melody is king and the chord accompaniment is a creative addition. That's why people are saying it's best when there's only one guitar at a time. A guitarist can add a great flavour to a tune by inserting interesting chords. Also the melody holds a very strong rhythm, so a guitar can add good counter-rhythms to spice it up. Finally, there is some advanced guitar technique that goes into which register is least occupied by other instruments in a session, and so leads to suggestions for where good guitarists can also add in small melodic runs to complement the main tune.

            "answer_text": "Our session adheres to the \"Killer B\" rule in which any instrument that begins with a \"B\" should only be played one at a time per tune. (Bodhrans, Box -which can include guitar and accordion, bouzouki, bass, bones, bombard, banjo and bagpipes). Otherwise the backup gets very muddy (and with different chords) or some instruments are not tuned to each other (and never will be) or more than one is too loud for the rest. Bones can include spoons and shaky eggs. If there are more than one of the Killer Bs present in any category, that group of musicians will take turns while the others drink. (We have a landlord who thinks that \"all you can drink for free\" is fine.) As with any instrument, there are experts and beginners. We encourage anyone to play in our session, but we have a number of expert musicians so we expect any beginner to learn as we go along. This includes guitarists who have three chords - we want them to play in key and the timing to be correct. We encourage them to take lessons and to go to the various festivals in the area to learn more. Six guitarists and one whistle player does not cut it, however. <G> In our session, at least, the guitar is a vital instrument to fill the sonic areas that fiddles and whistles don't touch. A good guitarist adds a lot to the music and a steady and thoughtful beginner can do the same although that person will be less sophisticated. (They have to know the tunes and be able to lilt them, otherwise they are not playing the music as far as we are concerned.) If we have four guitar players all playing slightly different chords and rhythms, it becomes unbearable and if there are a good number of players and the session is spread out, a good way for one side of the circle to lose touch with the other resulting in musical chaos. We honor these rules in the breach a lot, that free drink goes a long way to encourage the craic, but everyone in the session soon learns that we enjoy the music just as much and they try to make sure that it is a pleasure for everyone. Our guitarists are often singers who accompany themselves and we enjoy that too. Usually we have two guitarists but sometimes up to five depending on the night. Everyone is welcome but there are limits. ",
