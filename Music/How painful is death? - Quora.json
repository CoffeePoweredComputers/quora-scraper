            "answer_text": "Imagine being very slowly being run over by a paving roller, toes first. That would probably be painful enough that the pain alone would kill you before it got much past your ankles. But is being dead painful? No. Death is defined as the brain stopping. And pain is felt by the brain. (Which is why someone with a leg amputated at the knee can still feel pain in the toes of that foot - the nerve that used to go to that toe still goes from the stump to the brain, and if it\u2019s excited, the brain feels it as pain. [My second wife was a below the knee (BTK) amputee. She unknowingly dropped an unpopped popcorn kernel into the cup of her prosthetic leg. Then she was complaining about a sprained ankle - in the leg she no longer had. The kernel was pressing against the end of her \u201cankle pain nerve\u201d.]) So, since the brain is no longer functioning, it can\u2019t feel pain (or do or experience anything), so being dead can\u2019t be painful. If you feel pain, you aren\u2019t dead. ",

            "answer_text": "As for the person dying: I have no firsthand experience myself. So I won't say anything like others said.For people around him/her: yes it does hurt. It hurts a lot. I have experienced three deaths: My grandfather: I had always seen him as a strong person he was a reader in government college. He was on of the strictest and the most disciplined person I've ever encountered in my life. Yet when he was ill I saw him helpless and crying for someone to help him to reduce his pain... Here comes the part that still hurts... He got paralyzed!!! He couldn't say a word and tears were rolling and when I saw his face after he died( I was the one who closed his eyes), it appeared like he was still crying for help. That hurt a lot. It still hurts.My maternal uncle: (mama) There was a turmoil going on at the time of his death in his family. He committed suicide. As the fact of suicide sunk in... It started hurting again. It still hurts a lot!!!My father: It was a long ordeal of endless suffering for him and my mother. He had renal failure and after going through 3 months of dialysis, my mother had donated her kidney to him. After 7 months of long fearful days and nights of what will happen tomorrow, will he live to see the next day or not\u2026 he was discharged from the hospital because everything seemed OK. Exactly one week fast forward he suffered cardiac arrest at our home and died in the wee hours!!! After doing everything possible to save him, he just left like that without giving us any more chances to something! To sum up, it surely does hurt a lot!!!! ",
