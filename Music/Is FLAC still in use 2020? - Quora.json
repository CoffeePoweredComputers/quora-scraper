            "answer_text": "Absolutely. While the usage of FLACs by tapers of artists who allow audience taping has massively declined due to COVID, its usage for high resolution digital downloads continues. Acoustic Sounds has over 25,000 titles to choose from (some may be duplicates if they offer both 24/96 and 24/192) when selecting available FLAC downloads - https://store.acousticsounds.com/c/389/FLAC_Downloads FLAC is also the most supported lossless compression codec in the home, on Blu-ray players, 4K Ultra HD players, media streamers, media servers, Audio / Video Receivers, etc. For those who use a PC to archive all their digital audio like me, my 12TB of storage that can be accessed over gigabit LAN by either my Sony UBP-X800 (for multichannel playback), AVR or 4K HDR Shield, FLAC represents the best way to archive DVD-Audio, Blu-ray, CD and digital downloads.

            "answer_text": "Sure. Plenty of tools that rip CDs still use it. It\u2019s favored for ripping Blu-ray Discs with LPCM soundtracks. Also, you can legally purchase high-resolution music tracks online from places like HDTracks in FLAC format (they also support WAV and ALAC formats). So yes, FLAC is still employed in various places.
