            "answer_text": "if I really love the motions of the songs I read the lyrics a few times and play it over and over again. I learned all the words to YES albums and Emerson Lake and Palmer\u2026.like PIRATES\u2026.I can recite the whole thing with or without music. I can phonetically memorize songs in other languages like some Barbara Streisand songs. It just happens quickly and once they are there I remember even if haven\u2019t heard them in years. Don\u2019t know how but there are a shit load of complete songs in my head. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh, I don\u2019t remember them all the time. I screw them up quite often. :P Well, I think listening to a song(carefully) again and again might help you remembering the lyrics. If not, try listening to the song and reading it\u2019s lyrics at the same time. That might help as well. ",
