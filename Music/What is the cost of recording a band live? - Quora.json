            "answer_text": "Your final result depends on a few key factors: A) the size of your band, B) the size and quality of the concert hall, and C) the quality of the person/people doing the recording job.  If you can rent/use your own recording equipment, the cost drops significantly. This alone can bring the budget down to a few hundred or thousand dollars. If you're using someone else's gear or paying for it as part of their fees, this can bump you up a few hundred dollars. Recording isn't cheap - whether it's live or studio. If you want the final product to be high quality, expect to shell out at least a few hundred dollars, no matter what. This is simply because a ton of resources, time, knowledge and experience always goes into creating a piece of art. Making a few musicians sound great is a talent. I have been playing drums for about 16 years and playing in bands for around eight. I haven't been a part of larger, national acts (yet), but every time I've been in a band that has recorded anything, we've spent no less than $1,000.  So, my final answer? It really depends. I'd say if you're shooting for 1-5 tracks recorded live, and everything's balanced and high quality, don't go into business with anyone for less than $1,000-$2,000. This price range should cover the recording itself and any time it takes to get the finished product back to you.  If they're charging less than this, it generally means they have no clue what they're doing and are trying to get clients for cheap. Teslas cost more than Toyotas for a reason. If you're really going for something massive, of utmost quality or something similar, you can expect to be looking at $10,000+.  Prices above these would indicate star-quality from a producer. Essentially, when top-level bands and artists hit the studio to record, a lot of the money goes to the producer in many cases. Bands that are able to work with their favorite producer(s) usually end up spending more on this area alone. This is simply because beyond actually setting things up, recording the music, getting it mixed, mastered and finalized, there isn't a ton that's \"necessary\" for your music to sound great. ",

            "answer_text": "I specialise in recording EPs with bands and I always like to start with a live tracked core with overdubs and effects added on afterwards as necessary. I produced a few of Morrell's 12 EPs last year, things really got kicking with Late Nights Vol. 5 of which about 85% was live band recorded in the room. For a 3/4/5 piece band EP I would charge \u00a3600 which would get you 6 tracks tracked, mixed and mastered over 3 days. More than that number of people and we need more gear which increases the cost. Also location adds costs for transportation and hotels but basically it's just me! I've done a few live albums with bands and I'd love to do some more. Unfortunately they aren't yet in the public domain so I can't post links. Albums are \u00a31100 over 6 days but again with the caveat of number of band members and location. I do everything at my little studio in Birmingham UK, my style definitely has a unique flavour to it. Check out Beautiful Recordings for more info -  I'm just getting started ;) ",
