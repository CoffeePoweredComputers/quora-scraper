            "answer_text": "The greatest blues guitarists all over the world have literally used every kind of guitar amp combo there is, to get the juiciest of blues tones out. Sure, there are some preferred combinations, but getting good blues tones has more to do with playing and knowledge about tone shaping than with the guitar - amp combo. Those preferred combinations are more of personal preferences of the artists based on their playability, techniques, simplicity etc., than being connected with blues. Blues usually sounds great with a base tone that has a lot of body and slightly driven in order to fill a little more energy into those bends and twin note slides and trills that make blues what it is. This can be achieved with almost any guitar and amp out there and the rest is playing. In fact, the gear of choice for one of the greatest blues players out there, B. B. King, was a Gibson Les Paul or an ES 335 and a Marshall amp. But the tone had a feeble body and was ever so slightly driven and yet, he sounded phenomenal. There are other blues players like Robben Ford, that can be seen using both Fender and Gibson guitars with various amps and his tone is more aggressively driven, yet sounds smooth, just because of his playing.
