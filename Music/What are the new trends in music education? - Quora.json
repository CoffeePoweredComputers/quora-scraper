            "answer_text": "I actually know one new trend! I don\u2019t like it. But it\u2019s a trend! I can\u2019t remember a lot about the origins of it, but it\u2019s being implemented in schools a lot more lately, and it was mentioned to me by my college\u2019s choir director during my Vocal Methods course last semester. He said some woman big into researching effective sight-singing techniques had come up with a slightly newer version of the Takadimi method for reading rhythms. I\u2019m not actually sure how old Takadimi is, itself, as a system, but I only started hearing about it when I started college, as its the system taught at Brevard, in our Aural Skills classes. For those who don\u2019t know what Takadimi is, it\u2019s a way of counting out rhythms in music, but instead of the usual \u201c1 & 2 & a 3 e a 4 &\u201d sort of counting, you\u2019ve got \u201cTa di Ta dimi Taka mi Ta di.\u201d I think if I remember correctly the different syllables are supposed to help with grounding better diction and accuracy than the numeric counting, so that the rhythms are cleaner and, for me at least, sound a little more like what they\u2019re supposed to sound like, whatever that means. What was changed, however, was the addition of \u201cTo\u201d and \u201cTu\u201d to the mix, representing a half note and a whole note, respectively. So where you might have a quarter note, two eighths, and a half note before, you would have said, \u201cTa, Ta di, Ta,\u201d holding the third Ta for two beats, now you have \u201cTa, Ta di, To,\u201d with To for two beats. Not a really big change, but it seems pretty handy for distinguishing between long notes and shorter ones. I still like the long Ta\u2019s that I spent four semesters drilling into my brain, and I\u2019m glad we aren\u2019t switching to the new system outside of choir stuff, which still felt weird. It feels weird singing to when you want to sing ta. It really does. So there you have it! A relatively minor pedagogical trend, but it\u2019s a trend nonetheless! ",

            "answer_text": "A trend that I have watched grow over the past few years is the use of student devices in class- such as chrome books and iPads. Most my students have a chrome book during music, and with that, we log in to Quavermusic.com. It\u2019s a subscription site that my school district pays for, and students compose using easy to us notation software, they can play with different apps built on creating music, and stuff like that. Now this isn\u2019t all we do- but the use of personal devices in one way or another does represent a good portion of what we do. I don\u2019t know if universities realize this yet or not- they tend to be a bit behind in the times- but as a new music teacher, you\u2019ll want to know about the different strategies we can do with personal computing devices in the music classroom- it is a growing trend.
