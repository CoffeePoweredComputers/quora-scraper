            "answer_text": "I don't know your parents so I can only guess and offer examples of my own life in this answer. Let me begin by saying that I'm sorry if this is a point of conflict between you and your parents, any situation like that is not fun to be in. I've played video games a lot since I was old enough to hold the controller, and continue to play at least an hour almost every day around college life, work, and relationships. I feel that while I might play too much occasionally, I don't have a \"problem\" because I have other aspects of my life that aren't negatively impacted by my games. For example, I keep my grades up, learn music and stay healthy, work my job, but dedicate the hours of about midnight - 2AM daily to video games. I really do enjoy them that much. I distinctly remember playing Final Fantasy 12 when I was about 11 years old for about 7 hours straight one day. My father came down the stairs and yelled at me for wasting a day. He used the words \"that damn game\" and I was so ashamed I think I cried that night. My father even plays some games himself, he doesn't think they're evil or anything like that. I know many adults that think that video games are a \"waste of time\". There's a stigma that some people have that associates video games with fat greasy guys with long hair and no job. And that does happen, I see people like that often. There's a chance your parents are worried you will become one of those people if you become addicted to video games. Some people think that you could be doing something useful with your time instead of just having fun with a video game that is not constructive, but I would argue the same about watching any form of television. Maybe your parents see it as a non-social activity with no physical benefit. A lot of games are both of these, but I would argue that I have made life-long friends and am currently learning spanish because of a video game. Video games are what you make of them. They can be a huge waste of time and ruin your entire life if you let them, but I tend to think that the type of people that waste their life playing video games wouldn't have been a productive person regardless if they had video games. Your parent really do just want what's best for you. Maybe your parents hate them because of one of the above reasons or maybe it's something completely different. Good luck with the situation though. ",

            "answer_text": "In this area, there\u2019s two main types of parents - those who have played video games, and those who have not. For those who have not played video games, they fall into two distinct categories themselves - those who listen to \u201cnews\u201d sources about video games, and those who listen to actual studies or research the games. For those who have played, or still play, video games, they also fall into two distinct categories - those who know how to balance, manage, and understand them, and those who let it turn into a problem. Those who have not played and listen to news, and those who have played and let them become problematic, are typically against video games, to one degree or another. This is fear-based parenting - the parent does not want their child to succumb to \u201chorrors\u201d of becoming the media-portrayed video-gamer, or they don\u2019t want their child to go down the path they did. The parent is afraid, and is more likely to ban or severely limit any contact with games. In my opinion, this is worse, as if and when the child is exposed to video games (at whatever age), they do not have any true reference as to why it was forbidden/limited, and will often over-indulge anyway. Those who have not played yet researched or learned about games, and those who are gamers and understand, these parents usually know how to teach their kids to enjoy games with responsibility, time-management, and age-appropriate content. There is absolutely nothing wrong with video games themselves (same argument can be said about guns) - merely the way we use them. This is a slightly controversial topic, riddled with plenty of differing opinions and lots of pseudo-scientific \u201cresearch\u201d from both stances of the argument. Asking why video games are \u201chated by parents\u201d shows your own bias - you believe every parent is of the first category - fear-based. An objective question would be more along the lines of \u201cHow do parents feel about video games?\u201d I am a gamer. I am a parent. I understand the complexities of child development and how exposing a young child to violence too soon can be detrimental to their own development. I understand how younger children (and teenagers) can have a difficult time with time-management. I also understand how much fun a video came can be, and the potential benefits it can bring - motor skills, critical thinking, creativity, self-reflection, stress-relief, social interaction, etc. The goal of a parent (usually) is to help their child develop and become a functioning, healthy, responsible adult. I would not be a good parent if I made my decisions about video games without thoroughly understanding it myself. Yes, that means that it would be poor parenting to restrict video games because of insecurities and fears. ",
