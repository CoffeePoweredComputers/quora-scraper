            "answer_text": "I feel like Freddie didn\u2019t like heavy metal type of music, and I think this sometimes caused friction between Freddie and Brian when in the studio. There is an interview with a journalist named Lisa Robinson, where he flippantly says that he doesn\u2019t like the songs Brian writes, which is somewhat of a joke. I think Freddie did like the majority of Brian\u2019s songs just like Brian liked the majority of Freddie's songs. It was a band, so of course there was a lot of compromising because everyone\u2019s input mattered. In the same interview, Freddie talks about how he doesn\u2019t socialize with the band too much because they have different interests. He says that Brian, Roger, and John just go to Rock \u2018n Roll shows and he likes ballet and opera. During this time, the band was also going through a lot of turmoil, and I think it weighed on their friendship. However, I think Freddie liked more melodic music. He obviously liked to rock music, but I feel like he didn\u2019t like super heavy stuff. It is famously known that Freddie was not a fan of I\u2019m in Love with My Car. The story goes that Roger locked himself in a cabinet until Freddie agreed to let it be the B side to Bohemian Rhapsody. ",

            "answer_text": "He claimed not to like Brian\u2019s \u2018heavy metal\u2019 stuff, far preferring the soul stuff that both he and John were writing. Freddie doesn\u2019t write any \u2018heavy stuff\u2019 after \u2018New of the World\u2019 I think, but he certainly sings it. It\u2019s worth noting he said that type of thing when he and Brian were fighting, so it\u2019s not necessarily accurate. But given he goes from things like \u2018March of hte Black Queen\u2019, \u2018Bohemian Rhapsody\u2019 and \u2018The Millionaire\u2019s Waltz\u2019 to \u2018WATC\u2019, \u2018CLTCL\u2019 and others I think it possible he grew away from \u2018heavy\u2019 music.
