            "answer_text": "Generally Apps like spotify pay you (artists) $0.006 - $0.008Per Play. At the end of the month say you got a 100,000 Plays on your track. Now the total sum you earn will be around $600 - $700. This revenue is collected by your Label / Distributor and is then given to you after their share. What I mean is that basically you get your money once in 3 months (Labels) and your money every month (Distributor) from these services. Depending on your contract and terms you get the money from your Distributor. On the other hand, if you are planning on staying independent, then you will be able to collect the streams yourself without paying a dime to these distributors / Labels (These D/L have many advantages, but let's not get over it). Here is how the pay works for these streaming services Spotify - $.006 to $.008 Apple Music - $.006 to $ .0072 Google Play Music - $.006 Now the way they make money is through the monthly subscriptions that all of us pay for. :p.
