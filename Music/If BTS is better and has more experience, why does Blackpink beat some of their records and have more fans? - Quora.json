            "answer_text": "Ok. LET ME GET SOME FACTS STRAIGHT. Fans. Blackpink DO NOT have more fans than BTS. First of all, they\u2019re having trouble completely selling out concerts in America. Meanwhile, BTS sell out STADIUM concerts in matter of minutes after it starts to sell. Although Blackpink are extremely popular right now, it doesn\u2019t mean they have more fans than BTS. Awards. Blackpink has not won nearly as many awards as BTS have. How many awards in America has Blackpink won? And recently, BTS won both Top Duo/Group and Top Social Artist in the BBMAS. BTS also got nominated for the Grammys. Although fans for other artists are teasing us, saying we didn\u2019t win, did your favorites even get a nomination? No? ok. (maybe some did) Well tease us after you GET a nomination. And Daesangs. Do you know how many Daesangs BP has won compared to BTS? Firstly, BTS has won over 28 awards in 2018 ITSELF. I don\u2019t think BP has gotten that many in their more than 2 years. If they did, congrats, I guess? BTS has the most Daesangs won in 1 year. In the year 2018, they won 12 Daesangs. Has BP won that in over 2 years? No? Exactly. And records? What records did they break? DDU-DU-DDU-DU? Of course, I\u2019ll admit. Blinks are good streamers, and DDU-DU-DDU-DU is ahead of DNA in views. Blinks have at least 20 songs less than ARMYs to stream. They have, what, 9\u201310 MVs? Yes, for no albums, and all mini albums, 9\u201310 MVs is pretty good, but that\u2019s not really the point. Meanwhile BTS has 30+. Try streaming all that and still managing to be one of the most viewed groups. And BTS has broke the 24 hour record with Boy With Luv. Not just Kpop, but in YT history. And they\u2019re also the fastest to reach 10M, 50M, 100M, and 150M. Blackpink HASN\u2019T BROKEN THAT YET. Of course, they broke the 200M record. And BTS did that even though YT deleted over 20M views, and froze the views half the time. I\u2019m not saying YT didn\u2019t freeze KTL views, but they didn\u2019t delete any views. (Anyhow congrats to BP for being the first kpop group to get to 1B with 4D) Charting. Has BP ever gotten a #1 on the Top Artists Billboard? BTS has. And just recently. And the Melon chart. Boy With Luv is ahead of Kill This Love. Social Artist? BTS has been #1 for over 120 weeks. BTS is now the second band after the beatles to have three no. 1 on the Billboard, after the Beatles. Has BP done that? Sorry, I don\u2019t hate BP. Just stating facts. I\u2019m not saying Blackpink hasn\u2019t worked hard, in fact, I don\u2019t really have a place to stand in the Jennie \u201clazy\u201d controversy, because honestly, she could actually be sick or tired, more so than other members. But if she isn\u2019t, that\u2019s another debate. I\u2019m not trying to get people to hate Blackpink, I\u2019m just telling, okay, maybe rambling to this person and others why Blackpink has not beaten a lot of their records, and have more fans. Also, I\u2019m sorry if I was rude or offensive or biased. I\u2019m an ex-blink so that does stuff- people have their own opinions and i don\u2019t care if you disagree with mine EDIT: uhm so months have passed and im kind of a blink now? and my bias is jisoo. to the blinks out there if anyone is still reading this, do you suggest i delete this? or should i keep it up and just never write answers which provokes fanwars again/dragging groups ",

            "answer_text": "This is a Troll question if I ever read one and should be immediately removed from Quora. Let\u2019s deal with the last question first. BP has more fans? If this s true then why is it BP has trouble selling out their concerts in America, while BTS sells out their STADIUM concerts in a matter of minutes after they were announced. Now let\u2019s move to awards, has BP won any awards in America? Just last night BTS set another first by being the first ASIAN artist to win the DUO/Group Award from the BBMA\u2019s, along with winning their third Social Artist of the year award. Has BP ever come close to doing anything close to this? As for the records. You don\u2019t mention what records BP supposedly beat of BTS, but I will assume you mean those on YouTube. Problem is, these records were taken back by BTS just last week. Even though the people at YouTube removed 25 million views from BTS, they still beat the record to fastest to 100 million views, with a one day total of 74.6 million views, a record in itself that most likely won\u2019t be broken anytime time soon. What\u2019s interesting about this is that YouTube, took away 25 million views from BTS, but added nearly 7 million views to BlackPink so they could get their record. YouTube constantly says it is common practice for them to remove views from MV\u2019s during high streaming times, claiming that many of those views are bots, but when you look at their examples, you see that only one group has an extremely high count of views being removed, and in each case, that is BTS. Now, are you telling me that EXO fans are lazy? Are you telling me that BlackPink fans are lazy? Are you telling me that all other fandoms are lazy? Of course they aren\u2019t, they all work hard, just as hard as the ARMY does when BTS releases new MV\u2019s. So, sorry to bust your bubble troll bait, BTS has the records, the Awards, and the most fans. I\u2019m not dissing on your favorite BlackPink, just telling you like it is. If it\u2019s hard to accept, I\u2019m sorry, but it is what it is. Have a good day! ",
