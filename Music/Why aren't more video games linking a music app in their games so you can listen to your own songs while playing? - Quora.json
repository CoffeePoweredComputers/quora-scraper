            "answer_text": "Why would they? For the vast majority of games this would be no different to playing music while trying to watch a movie. Soundtracks are carefully crafted for each game, at no small expense, so ignoring them is hardly likely to be encouraged. Plus it's not as though turning off the music track and playing something else in the background or on another device is a challenge to set up. Direct music app support would be a lot of effort for something that adds no value. There may even be licensing issues that legally prevent it. ",
