            "answer_text": "Nothing that was ever right with it. It does what it always did, just more directly, more efficiently and more frequently in a more targeted way. In truth the simple answer is money and easier quicker access to a payout than ever before because of technology. This has had the effect of \u2018stealing the soul\u2019 from music. However I don\u2019t agree with this, it is just what a lot of people think and feel. Also music can be largely generated now and a lot of what we hear about an artist could be made by any other artist easily since an artist is the team behind the artist a lot of the time. The producer can just shop around for a talent\u2026 the business side of things holds all the power and you\u2019re just you so do what they say and make your sales targets or we\u2019ll give this \u2018great song\u2019 (aka any song they decide to throw enough money at) to someone else These arent absolutes of course but there are very few people who control the ebb and tide of how music sounds and where and when it is played, they've achieved great success but these days if you know what you\u2019re doing you can throw out a tune pretty quickly\u2026 so the difficulty in the art is somewhat diminished\u2026 it has less to say imo Of course there are artists who do have something to say, I try to be one but I also am so overly independent that I\u2019ll never let a company help me achieve anything\u2026 or maybe I\u2019d sell out if they offered but I won\u2019t put myself in a position where they really know I exist\u2026 it might happen one day but I won\u2019t chase it haha There is nothing wrong with music for entertainment, nothing inherently bad about it and if you don\u2019t like what is on the radio just upgrade your technological awareness and switch it off. Download some music you do like. In today\u2019s day and age there is no real legitimate reason not to be listening to what you want to listen to. There are many times more options out there than there ever has been as music is now accessible to everyone not just those passionate talented few or rich companies. I haven\u2019t a clue who or what has been happening in the charts for over a decade and I\u2019m only 30. Just like I do not watch TV because I have the internet so I can\u2019t even tell you what adverts have come and gone as they don\u2019t exist in my viewing experience anymore. I can\u2019t imagine who would want them, or why. You do realise it\u2019s 15 minutes of every hour minimum you are paying to watch adverts? That\u2019s not only time wasted but electricity too!! It\u2019s very lazy and inefficient imo, but then again maybe I\u2019m a geek so I know how to figure these things out. I\u2019m certainly not a traditionalist anyway\u2026 Putting the radio on and being disheartened by the homogenised and vapid (the normal perspective on the industry\u2019s latest product) sound of whatever is selling best is a choice you made. The problem isn\u2019t the industry it is how people engage with the industry. If you don\u2019t like it then it wasn\u2019t actually for you to listen to, you weren\u2019t the target audience and they already likely know that you won\u2019t like it based on your age etc, but you not liking it can and will help younger people define their generation in rebellion to you. They capitalise. So stop pretending that if you listened to Justin Bieber or whoever you would always hate it because that\u2019s not how the human brain works, what you hate is how they utilise that science against you. Music is not \u2018shit nowadays\u2019 it is exceptional if you go and find the existing artists who are creatively in control of their own destiny. There are many times more of these than ever existed. Otherwise it is a handful of audio scientists making recipes from their equations targeting specific ears just like it always was. We just don\u2019t have a movement in our generation (I\u2019m 30 in the U.K.) to identify ourselves with\u2026 except we did it just didn\u2019t sweep across us all because we all have the option to listen to whatever we want and we have lost the culture that allows it to manifest in that way because we are less easy to influence. Blame iPods and the internet, headphones and the like because in many ways they isolate us from the external influence. Or blame life for aging you out of the target market, or blame it on the consequence of having so many options to choose from that no particular development has the ability to truly stand out anymore. We are exposed to so many more variables now than ever, have more control and are aware of the options or can be notified. It\u2019s harder and harder to turn to someone and share your little secret find since they probably already know, there\u2019s no exclusivity any more. However it is also harder to know all the secrets because the world is saturated with options. So we split into individuals, away from the pack. We snuff out any organic flame before it can catch on but we simultaneously have the capacity to make anything explode even if it is counterculture and counter-industry\u2026 when things online go viral they aren\u2019t necessarily actually good but rather they can be odd or interesting or meta referencing etc etc. We also, en mass, don\u2019t need or want to pay for music but even when we do we want to make sure the money actually goes to the band\u2026 and these days we can directly donate and transact with individuals not represented by a company more than ever. Our cultural identity is protected behind a wall of profiles and usernames. So we don\u2019t have to be directly influenced by advertising campaigns in the same way that we used to. If I feel like I\u2019m being advertised to then you\u2019ve already lost me, unless I already wanted it. Targeted advertising algorithms work in my favour, but I can cut the head off in an instant by using DuckDuckGo rather than Google and so on. It\u2019s actually a fascinating topic if you really dive into how technology is impacting our social development ;) What\u2019s wrong with the music industry today? Nothing, they\u2019re making plenty of profits in many of the same ways they used to, it is the rise in cynicism and individualistic micro-cultures that has made it jar with many It works for those seeking an identity, these days that\u2019s mostly teenagers and so the radio and pop is for teens Would you complain about a kids tv station having no mature content or would you change the channel? One final factor, your music tastes are developed during your teens and it informs what you will listen to for many years to come, this is also why each generation has its heroes ",

            "answer_text": "It's more about the promoters than the actual product. In truth, music, as well as other forms of entertainment, has become shameless propaganda supporting a rich and famous lifestyle. Musicians used to be seen as low-class artisans\u2014that's no longer, obviously. They did it for love, not for notoriety. It began to get corrupted around the time music was a way to make a lot of cash. When it became a Las Vegas show rather than a heartfelt piece of poetry or instrumental. Music was a quick and easy way to rise to the top, and get rich. Somewhere along the line, Hollywood overtook the music industry. Hollywood is no longer exclusive to acting, but all forms of entertainment. The Hollywood glamour cross genres, and now what musicians were wearing and who they were dating became the utmost importance. Arguably, over their actual creative work. Then, a fantastic invention: autotune. Now, anyone can sing. However, autotune is easily detectable, and it sounds like Siri on Karaoke night. People like Madonna and Britney Spears had no actual singing talent, but they had the image. Then, TV shows like Hannah Montana told the youth that being famous is so fun! Now, here we are, 2017. The past year has been a horrendous year, not because the songs were bad per say, but they were frigid and heartless. Nothing is sung with true passion, and the robotic autotune and beats take care of that for you. It's been a subpar year, for sure. To bring up subject matters, there are only three subjects you're allowed to sing about. I think we all know what subjects these are. The only sad songs are breakup anthems, the only passionate songs are about intercourse, and the only upbeat songs are about partying. My favorite is when a song sounds like it might not be about love, and then, you hear the pronoun 'you'. It could have been a broader subject, but no, we can't take risks. We're supposed to look up to singers as idols, and completely love them. It might not be their fault that they only sing about romantic love and partying, it's just their lifestyle. Once you're famous, you're corrupted because you live a life of pleasure. Is this an accident? You often see artists come out with a fantastic first album and the second album is mediocre and heartless. Lorde comes to mind. Her first album talked of teenaged angst and aristocracy. Now, she's singing about partying, like everyone else. She acts like it's this amazing thing, but in reality, she's never been this shallow. By the way, I'm not buying the Synesthesia thing\u2014she never mentioned it before now. Speaking of Synesthesia, artists will self-diagnose themselves with something, in a feeble attempt at being relatable. In her case, I think she claims to have Synesthesia because it sounds like a cool condition to have. She's now doing full videos on her Synesthesia, which she NEVER MENTIONED before now. She even has old videos on her songwriting process, and she never mentioned seeing 'dancing colors' around her when she hears the music. For instance, if I had a dime every time a female celebrity came out as bisexual, I'd be rich enough to be a celebrity. Listen, being bisexual doesn't mean you would do something, or you think a girl is pretty. By the way, it doesn't make you interesting either. You know what would make you interesting? Writing a dang good song, that's what. Kristin Stewart comes to mind. In reality, she's nothing but a terrible actress and this bisexual thing makes it so people can't hate her. In terms of the actual music, it's too electronic and sounds overproduced. The snap-beat carries that track, and it might have a cheap roller coaster drop that sounds like a remix. With men, it's a lazy drawl, with women, it's a breathy, whiny sound. Or a popular singing style, the half-closed throat. It sounds like an on-pitch croak, and everyone is doing it now. Alessia Cara, Daya, and Halsey are all artists who use this vocal style, and it's annoying. So far in 2017, The Hot 100 has been completely boring. Songs like Tunnel Vision were utterly terrible, but it was the music video depicting a Trump-Supporting Dixie enthusiast trying to hunt down a black guy. Many songs have opted for the shocking music video rather than a decent song, and it shows. Besides, why can't we have a rap song that doesn't make reference to a ho every minute, even when the song about something of worth like racism? You'd think their names were Ida! We're living restless, ominous times, and I wish we'd have more to show for it. Our music shows the shallow, material world of the rich, but nothing more. It doesn't show realism, it doesn't even show real emotions. This is why celebrities shouldn't be politicians--they live completely separate from regular mortals like you and me. In all, music is so terrible because it's promoting a message of luxury and fame, not real lives. Even the Indie scene is like this. Although, the music industry reflects our times, materialistic and capitalistic. There is very little room for true art in a capitalistic society, or any free thought for that matter. All branches of media have fallen into this. News, books, television, and music. Music is the most blatant, though. ",

            "answer_text": "It is sad to see the industry today when one compares it to the days of the 60\u2019s -80\u2019s when it was about proving your chops by plugging away for many thousands of hours in crappy bars and opening for bands that had made it. Nowadays with the advent of social media, YouTube and the ability of many more people to have access to recording equipment - the industry has become watered down. Also - consider the change in music styles over the past few decades - in the early days of songwriting - focus was on a great melody. Nowadays, music has become more rhythm-based. Whether it is easier to create what is considered popular music nowadays due to this fact, I\u2019ll leave up to you to decide. Putting out \u2018album tracks\u2019 and/or being a highly skilled instrumentalist is considered somewhat pretentious in this day and age. The general population is not as impressed by the virtuoso musician as it once was. Why buy and album with 3 or 4 great tracks out of 15 when you an just download the ones you like? The industry has had to focus in on a \u2018winning formula\u2019 for writing tracks instead of allowing an artist to create and develop. It is now not uncommon to have 5\u20136 people working on one song to ensure that it \u2018works\u2019 technically and ticks all the boxes for what people like. In the days of the flamboyant rock-star - trashing hotel rooms and getting into fights - part of the fun and admiration came from this \u2018other world\u2019 lifestyle that we could admire. \u2018Celebrity\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean what it used to (see: Made in Chelsea / The Only Way is Essex) and (to make a massive over-generalisation) people are more concerned about how they are going to survive the next few years rather than what some rich person is doing on TV. In summation - the industry is more focused on the disposable nature of artists / songs which the music world has evolved into. The time of the Rock-star is gone. Will we ever see a star as lauded and well-known as Elvis Presley again - very unlikely. Lady Gaga is likely to be remembered for a long time, but probably not in the same ways as Elvis in terms of changing the landscape of music. Strangely - one of the highest grossing tour artist for the last year was Billy Joel. So there is still a need and desire for the \u2018music of yesteryear\u2019. The appeal, in my opinion, tells us more about what we aren\u2019t getting from the music of today. ",

            "answer_text": "Sorry to answer a question with a question but why do you think anything is wrong with the music industry? The current leading answer gives a lot of feedback about the focus on celebrity, autotune, style over substance. Yes I\u2019d say those are all issues, but those are problems with music and artists and not the industry. Someone says \u201cAutotune means anyone can sing?\u201d Ok - I don\u2019t disagree with you, but call up Ryan Tedder or Dan Wilson and ask them how easy it is to write a pop song - just because you can package something doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy. Here\u2019s the actual \u2018industry problem\u2019 but let me start with the caveat that the music industry is growing. There\u2019s a bright future for music, art and creativity: 80% of music retail went out of business in the US between 2001 and 2006. The incentive structure has changed, but the industry is still trying to maintain a structure that worked in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s If the INDUSTRY has a problem it\u2019s that the content creation community is now at odds with the priorities of the distribution mechanism. None of the top means of music distribution (Apple, Amazon, Target, Best Buy and Walmart) list music as their #1 source of revenue. This is the biggest change in the digital era. Even the next in line who do focus entirely on music, Pandora and Spotify, have other priorities (Pandora is a publicly traded company with its own focus on return for investors and keeping the lights on and Spotify is a tech start-up who benefits more from developing valuation than developing artists). That\u2019s not to say none of these companies, including Spotify and Pandora especially, don't care about music and aren\u2019t full of people who care about music. It\u2019s just at odds with the heyday of record industry in which artist created music > label paid for creation in marketing > record store sold music and money flowed theoretically back to the label to reimburse their investment and then the artist. Theoretically. Now the investment and creation of the music is disjoined between self-funded and the aging label structure. Distribution is democratized by companies like TuneCore, STEM and CD Baby but the majors dominate. Social media is the main form of marketing so the artist is expected to promote their own music to drive people to the \u2018stores.\u2019 And when they get to the end-use point the revenue model is split off from the original art. Apple makes money when you buy phones and computers - the music is content there to keep you coming back for more hardware. Amazon makes money when you buy prime memberships - the music is content to keep you using the products and re-upping your subscription. Walmart makes money when you buy everything in your life there - the music is an impulse buy at checkout for a few extra bucks to keep customers happy. Spotify makes money from subscriptions and user growth which balloons its valuation. When record stores existed they were record stores. They were incentivized to promote and help artists. It\u2019s an idealized world and it wasn\u2019t perfect then either - but if you need to identify a \u2018problem\u2019 with the \u2018industry\u2019 this would be my choice. ",

            "answer_text": "The BEST POSSIBLE argument ,I\u2019m capable of, for why contemporary music is NO DIFFERENT to any other music before it, and why people who think it is are, well\u2026.not exactly correct (putting it diplomatically)! Quick Aside: If I may I wanted to respond to specific sentiments the previous commenters shared, Karen specifically, as well as answer the question posed overall. In the most respectful way of course and with no malice or arrogance intended. Alright If I am paraphrasing the strong and empassioned points made earlier, the issue most often described in a nutshell is that modern/contemporary music is too commodified, and as a result music today is vapid and lacks truth or passion. So if I am more or less understanding the point of view I\u2019d like to point out something that you may not have realized or gotten the chance to give much thought/ research to. Off the top I have to talk about \u201cLisztomamia\u201d Lisztomania | Music Notes from Reverb.com | Ep. #1 . This phenomenon is regarded highly as one of if not THE first instance of pop stardom in history, similar to \u201cBeetle Mania\u201d. But First we have to get all the way caught up. PLEASE STICK WITH ME HERE: IT\u2019S WORTH IT. Music in early human history was largely monophonic (meaning one note or tone), choral and consisting of an entirely male choir, and for the express purpose of worship i.e. a praise song of sorts but using specific scripture as the lyrics. Choral music was more or less just a big group chant and truly not all that exciting; monks would sing gospel or hymns for days at a time even. Then at a certain point Gregorian style \u201cmusic\u201d became polyphonic, utilizing harmony and tonal intervals simultaneously. Then the next development would be the shift toward accompaniment, bringing instruments into the church (but only specific instruments that were pleasing to the lord and would elevate the music to the heavens). Then there comes possibly the biggest shift, Music becomes secular, no longer being composed exclusively for religious purpose but for entertaining. This gave way to chamber music, with composers being retained or requested for private performerance and supported through patrons and sponsors. Now bringing it back to Franz Liszt! If you described a superstar/rockstar and what they might be like, you would probably say that they play fully sold out venues and dress vibrantly. They perform with penache and ooze charisma and style. They are effortlessly charming and have hordes of adoring fans who scream for them night after night as they travel from town to town causing girls to faint in the crowd and men to brood from jealousy. WITHOUT QUESTION, that person is Franz \u201cmother cussing\u201d \u201cMr Stealith Yo Lass\u201d \u201cBaroque and Roll\u201d LISZT! DADA DADA DAAAA ITS THE ONE ONE AND ONLY D-O-DOUBLE G     With this in mind it would seem that the only point in the history of music where music existed as a sort of poem OR, an endeavor that was pursued where artists composed without intention of commodification being the goal would be at the very beginning, however even then music was composed out of duty or obligation, as this was the belief of parishioners, that composing music was one of several requirements to be fulfilled and not purely for reasons of personal enjoyment. There was one rule, music is for God and absolutely nothing else. If it is not intended for God or worship then it just simply didn\u2019t exist, and not in way that\u2019s like \u201cwe don\u2019t recognize music that isn\u2019t about God, get this BS up out of here cuz, on GOD if you don\u2019t raise up and STEP!!!\u201d but like in the LITERAL sense, music that wasn\u2019t for God just straight up didn\u2019t exist! Creating music for the sake of it just hadn\u2019t occurred to anyone, at least not in any meaningful and impactful way for quite some time. Anything earlier than the Gregorian \u201cstylized\u201d period of music could really, at best, be a primitive form of music that was composed out of utilitarian necessity; as a means of communicating over a distance with a defined set of tones and patterns. E.G. \u201cTAP CLICK TAP CAWW CAWW\u201d  TRANSLATION: \u201cPack of BIG ASS lions over there and THEY .. AINT \u2026 B***S****NG!!!! This can\u2019t even really be thought of as music though, or certainly not how we have come to understand music and musicality today; because in this form the tones and rhythms are more language and not all that \u201cmusical\u201d! So\u2026excluding music that acted as a substitute for language or long distance communication, and music that was composed out of religious duty, really at no point did music exist purely as a means of personal passion with musicians having no expectation of making it a vocation. Getting paid for being a musician was a REQUIREMENT!!! If a musician wanted to be able to continue doing it then earning a living is an absolute NECESSITY!! However this doesn\u2019t mean that their isn\u2019t real passion or dedication and personal fulfillment when musicians create, if there wasn\u2019t then there wouldn\u2019t be much point doing it (obvious statement is obvious, I know). I believe that most would agree with the following notion; being a \u201csuccessful\u201d musician, means that a musician is able to support themselves, by utilizing their craft and employing their passion, as a means of achieving and maintaining BASIC monetary stability, while also earning enough to properly fund/finance the continuation of these creative endeavors. Measuring success in any artistic field most definitely does include other things, but I would think it is reasonable to say that someone is a \u201csuccess\u201d if they are able to sustain themselves by doing something they are passionate about. The thing is though, in order to do that you have to be able to earn money, and in order to earn money you have to be recognizable (replace with popular) so the public can identify the things you specifically have created, and in order to do THAT you have to have some level of notoriety and brand recognition (read; MARKETING and BRANDING). Anything short of that, is a musician on their own, composing music solely for themselves to consume, with zero consideration given to whether the product would be appealing to anyone apart from themselves. Making music just for yourself is equally as valid and rewarding and I don\u2019t want to gloss over that or diminish that aspect of the creative process, however if someone wants to be able to share that effort with others and most importantly actually CONTINUE to make music then they will have to step into a different space where earning a living is a requirement, especially if you want to actually keep being able to not only make music but live; you can\u2019t exactly continue making music if you can\u2019t eat, sleep with a roof over your head, clothe and bathe yourself, have electricity (or a fire/candle light if you prefer), repair or purchase/replace instruments, never mind funding future musical endeavors you can forget about it!!! Drafting sheet music COSTS MONEY; if you can\u2019t put up the scratch to actually PUBLISH (get it to an audience) your work then it\u2019s GAME OVER  Still With Me? Almost there\u2026 If we move forward from this point in time which is none other than *Franz \u201cTHERE HE GO\u201d LISZT* The EYYYYEZ THO  *softly whispers* \u201ctake me\u201d With all that history considered, what about now, what truly has changed? Some like yourself may point to specific things like Auto Tune as the main culprit, the thorn in the paw of TRUE and REAL artists *SCOFFS DISGUSTEDLY*, so let\u2019s examine auto tune!  Auto tune was first created as a means of detecting seismic shifts in order to find and drill for oil, Dr Hildebrand (The Mathematical Genius of Auto-Tune (The Mathematical Genius of Auto-Tune) ) didn\u2019t initially create this product for this purpose and discovering that it could effect pitch was just a happy sort of accident basically. Further looking into it though, you discover that it\u2019s usage as a pitch correcting tool was utilized with near ubiquity from pretty much the late 80\u2019s to now. It\u2019s main function is to subtly nudge tones toward a specific key, and when used in this way it\u2019s hardly detectable, so undetectable in fact that most people still don\u2019t know truly how MUCH it is used and even for how LONG artists have been using it (and I like to think I should know as it is my job to compose songs, and I got my first record label showcase while still in high school which dropped me headfirst into the \u201cbig machine\u201d as a performer and songwriter), so it\u2019s usage at this point is a non-starter and no matter how many artists say they don\u2019t use it and want to keep it \u201cpure and real\u201d THEY STILL USE IT! The modern audience\u2019s pallet is so attuned to it that actually hearing raw untreated vocals is every bit of the word \u201cunappealing\u201d. I mean not to use it as a form of SUBTLE\u2026correction would leave you dead in the water; guess what, now you aren\u2019t making ANY music at all because you can\u2019t even get people to listen to your records in the first place. By the time we get to the late 90\u2019s, Cher decided that the \u201covercorrection\u201d that auto tune is capable of could be used as an effect, no different to a guitar player using effects on a rack or pedal board that manipulate tones in an interesting way. Auto tune can be musical, as much has been demonstrated, however if you\u2019re the sort of person that is just completely over the sound of it then that\u2019s completely reasonable and understandable, but to escape it you have to go back to roughly the mid 80\u2019s. The problem with that though is that a device called the \u201cTalk Box\u201d exists, which is essentially auto tune but in analog form. This a tool that Stevie Wonder used to BEAUTIFUL effect in 1972 and it is truly truly beautiful and perfect; here\u2019s a clip (00:36 seconds in he starts performing)  I IMPLORE YOU to tell me that Stevie WONDER\u2026.isn\u2019t one of the shiniest, most celebrated and beloved, deeply treasured musicians that EPITOMIZES earnestness and authenticity, AS WELL AS unshaking in his dedication and perseverance in his career and his craft. I DARE YOU!!! I wish you WOULD!!! SQUARE UP!!! But WAIT; even earlier then THAT a similar device was used to delight 1000\u2019s of country and folk music fans in a song called \u201cForever\u201d by Pete Drake released in 1963 (skip to 00:50 to get straight to the \u201ctalking guitar\u201d part)  If I am making any case at all for auto tune then it would be that auto tune both as a form of correction and as a vocal effect that can be used in a musical way has existed in some form since the late 50\u2019s. \u201cOk but what about all this sexualization and general waywardry, huh\u2026?\u201d You say Oh no worries\u2026  Subject Matter The point of contention with regard to lyrical content is another reason given for why contemporary music is just so dreadful. The \u201cthree topics\u201d I think most refer to (if I am guessing) would really be sex, drugs, and maybe money or just blind consumerism in a larger sense, gang banging (hood rat things with friends) could be another option. If we tackle that then we run into a similar problem as auto tune, which is that these are hardly new topics or symptoms of contemporary music alone, and that really is no secret. As I pointed out earlier, music that isn\u2019t scriptural came later, so aside from lyrics about God or music that is composed for an instrument and performed without lyrics, then sex, drugs, and money as subject matter date back as far as folk lore set to music. It\u2019s true that there may have been more poetic and romantic ways of discussing those topics, but also there exists vulgarity and absurdity in equal prominence. People want to believe that advocating drug use is a today\u2019s music sort of thing but\u2026.really though\u2026.don\u2019t do that\u2026we know better than that. Allow me to point you to Exhibit B (as in Billboard Top 100 charts) 15 Best Songs About Drugs Take a look at some of the dates. If people were \u201cmuch more wholesome\u201d and \u201cintolerant of filth in music\u201d then PLEASE explain to me how songs perform at the CHART TOPPING LEVEL since Nielsen reporting and Billboard placement reporting and earning sheets! So I ask, HOW??? WHEN??? When was this time of puritanical sensibilities in lyrics or music that\u2019s continually uplifting and never would ever broach subjects of such low regard? Want a more comprehensive list? Songfacts - Songs about drugs (STUPID long list BTW) It seems to me that music about drugs specifically, whether it be an advocation or repudiation, is a topic so unthinkably common and omnipresent, that you can\u2019t get through a single solitary MONTH without drugs being a component of the lyrical narrative in some form on popular radio AND Jazz radio AND country radio. So once all that\u2019s done then what do you have left but praise and worship (I think I am seeing a pattern). Drugs in music is and always was a major component and sometimes it\u2019s the ONLY component! Clapton, there anything you\u2019d like to add?  But that\u2019s just since people started keeping records about music that becomes popular enough to chart. The idea of drunken sailors singing songs about fast women and getting as screwed up as possible didn\u2019t come from a vacuum, that is a real thing. Even songs about people getting messed up on drugs and making babies exist in music about mythology with Norse and Greek Gods! Hell even lyrics and entire themes about murder and death pop up in classical music as well as stage and traveling plays in Renaissance Britain CONSTANTLY!. Scops music ( Pronounced SHOPES. A Scop is a sort of performer for royal medieval courts, not like a jester specifically but not entirely unlike either, pretty much just an entertainer), the lyric and poetry they made is no different in its utilization of those same unsavory topics as a means of conveying valor or pride of a town because of their great warriors who killed scores of men and laid with the most women. It\u2019s inescapable.  \u201c Dropeth thine posterior to da flo Mi Lady, for I\u2026am a REAL one\u201d Ok I am wrapping it up Maybe it\u2019s possible that the reason these topics are so pervasive and ever present is because there is a universality to these things that lends itself to being digestible and easy to connect with emotionally. Love poems of the past set to music, is unsurprisingly not much different to today; with regard to topics of sexuality, debauchery and debasement, dangerous and unmitigated drug and alcohol abuse, and even gang banging (but like in the ethereal sense with Gods and Angels and such, but also with empires and pillagers) the B.C period musically speaking was, if I may, LiT ! That\u2019s only because we all have some pretty similar experiences. Songs about \u201cthe things I\u2019d buy with my gold\u201d aren\u2019t relegated to today\u2019s pop and rap music in isolation, and writing about a drug fueld lucid dream could be written about a Chinese opium den as well as a lively night club or even a destitute trap house; and what is an opium den but a trap house I mean let\u2019s be honest haha! Seeking out music that in no way shares the same topics or use of some form of technology as today is a forgone conclusion, it just simply is not the case and at virtually no point in history was it ever. Writing about things that we all feel happens so often because of that reason, ipso-facto, by that fact, we ALL feel the same feelings, have the same desires and sometimes destructive impulses, and hate that feeling of falling in love over and over again, because that\u2019s another time you have to start all over again: because it\u2019s vulnerable to love. Using technology in novel and interesting ways is such an intrinsic part of the musical landscape same as the discovery of harmony and polyphonic symphonization; technology isn\u2019t just computers and digital workstations like Pro Tools, it is also threading a luth with nylon or synthetic fiber as opposed to cat gut (real thing btw stringing a luth or pretty much any and all strung instrument with cat guts) in order to produce a deeper richer sound while saving time and money. Contemporary pop music, sure at times is just aggravating and so utterly vacuous and trifling, but make no mistake there are songs that are entirely captivating and overwhelmingly arresting, and capable of evoking such deep emotion that you react in a visceral and guttural way almost with no control over it. Suggesting that something like this doesn\u2019t require skill, precision, dedication and unwavering mastery would get you either laughed out of every venue, recording studio, record label and writing session or forecefully THROWN OUT with extreme prejudice! So at the end of the day if someone wants to hear music that is unobstructed by selacious and fleeting or flippant topics, or exists outside of the monetary system and is made for the sake of purity and joy well then\u2026.I guess there\u2019s always Gregorian Chant (sort of), here\u2019s 3 hours of it!

            "answer_text": "The public is right at the heart of the problem, at the behest of the distribution platforms. The public wants all-it-can-eat supply for a fixed fee. It\u2019s unsustainable. Of course the public wants more for less. That\u2019s natural. With physical products that isn\u2019t easy to provide. While music required a physical distribution on tape or CD or even on a chip, there was a mechanism for revenue from multiple copies to be fed back to the artists. Once music became digital it was trivial to provide unlimited copies with no mechanism for revenue from multiple copies to be fed back to the artists. Downloading of copies from digital libraries is at least controllable. There is a way to gather revenue per download and prevent unlimited copying. Whilst platforms like iTunes worked to do that with Digital Rights Management and similar systems, greed is a great motivator and led to the rise of illegal download sites like Napster, which naturally became popular with the public, in the mistaken belief that they did no harm. The industry decided to combat this by legitimising streaming. The problem here is that the big players raised massive licensing fees by allowing streaming companies to have their catalogues, but the feeding back of revenue to the artists is the last thing on their minds. The industry has gone from selling physical media that gave the artist a percentage of each item sold, to unlimited streaming where the artists need ten thousand \u201csales\u201d to get the same revenue they used to get from ONE. The streaming subscription, generated from the output of artists, belongs to the platform and the licencing label. They have nothing without the artists, but they don\u2019t care that the artists starve because they can live off the back catalogue. New music is worthless to the industry. Existing music is worthless to the artist. ",

            "answer_text": "Even till early 90s we had people called singers. Now we have autotunes , performers but singer is missing . I will use one of the most iconic songs to show the difference. We all must have heard it once . I am talking about \u201cWe are the world \u201c.  Here is behind the scenes of making of song   The documentary itself is a treat to watch. I understood why it iconic: you had singers . Not everyone singer here was famous was good but their was meticulous effort . People were respectful & trying to learn,no autotune, no tantrums . Than you had talents like Michael Jackson , Cyndi , Steven Perry . In 2010 they remade this iconic song . Obviously they didn't dare to replace MJ entirely because he is too iconic . But you had \u201cJustin Bieber\" in start . This guy can't sing one line without autotune.  Comment section were filled with praise for Celine Dion and Michael Jackson. In the new version she is better than her contemporary most of whom sucked or were just average. Their is also no doubt that she is quite talented but even she sucked compared to Cyndi , whose line she was singing. This is the level of talent music industry has when one of the most talented singer of even 90s couldn't keep up with yesteryear talent . If I am not wrong among female singerTaylor Swift dominated last decade. Her voice cracks , can't pick the high notes , sings flat in live shows . How on earth she became so successful ? I won't even go on Justin Bieber. What do you think will be the situation of Music Industry , when we don't even have singer . ",

Lo mismo pasa ahora, hay que buscar a buenos artistas y no quedarse con lo que pasa en la radio. Hay musicos que tienen material interesante, como Tash Sultana, y las letras de las canciones no siempre fueron una obra de arte ni ahora ni antes. Entonces, el problema no es que no haya musica interesante y novedosa. El verdadero problema, en realidad, es que no hay tanto interes en esta por parte de la industria musical. Porque estoy bastante segura de que deben haber un monton de peque\u00f1as bandas que no son apoyadas, casi siempre lo comercial gan\u00f3 a la buena calidad. Vivir de musico en contra del sistema hoy en dia no creo que sea facil. Tambien hay que tener en cuenta que la industria musical apoya mas a la musica de EEUU, Reino Unido o Australia. Que pasa con todos los demas musicos? Tienen que emigrar a algunos de esos paises para tener una oportunidad? Si, si quieren llegar lejos, generalmente, emigran. En conclusion, la industria musical es una perra. Pero por que debemos conformarnos? Nosotros consumimos la basura que producen, entonces por que seguir aceptando esto? Promovamos la creatividad y el talento, no el comercialismo y la monotonia. Saludos desde Argentina. Voy a traducir esto en Ingles, asi que probablemente pierda un poco el sentido. I am going to translate this into English, so I probably lose a bit of sense. IN ENGLISH: The good music was rarely visible to the naked eye, but today it is still admired. The same thing happens now, you have to look for good artists and not stay with what happens on the radio. There are musicians who have interesting material, like Tash Sultana, and the lyrics of the songs were not always a work of art neither now nor before. So the problem is not that there is no interesting or new music. The real problem, really, is that there is not so much interest in it from the music industry. Because I'm pretty sure that there should be a lot of small bands that are not supported, almost always the commercial beat the good quality. Living as a musician against the system nowadays, I do not think it's so easy. We must also bear in mind that the music industry supports more music from the US, the UK or Australia. What's up with all the other musicians? Do they have to emigrate to some of those countries to have an opportunity? Yes, if they want to go far, generally, they emigrate. In conclusion, the music industry is a bitch. But why should we conform? We consume the garbage they produce, so why continue accepting this? We should promote creativity and talent, not commercialism and monotony. ",

Music today is not made by actual musicians who are trained to play instruments, write songs and compositions, etc. Technology has replaced a lot of musicians and the content they used to make. \u2026Mainstream music used to be about rock and roll mostly, with fun music and lyrics and slightly rhetorical concepts mixed with whatever else\u2026 however this couldn\u2019t last forever for some reason\u2026 and music started to become more about peoples problems and struggles than fun. \u2026Mainstream music is basically created around a few fundamental technologies, methods of communication, and an audience. It has always been mostly geared towards young people. The one thing that has played the biggest role in influencing what music is is definitely the radio. The radio has explicitly almost unilaterally controlled what music is heard by the general population. Radio still exists today and still is the biggest factor in generating interest in music. Buying music still exists but is becoming more rare with shared streaming services. The audience for music changes about every 7 years in a drastic way, because when people are 16 they like one sound and relate to one thing, then when their 23\u201325 they mature and lose interest in the same sound, and so also businesses recognize this and attempt to get ahead of that and influence people by investing in whatever is new\u2026.
