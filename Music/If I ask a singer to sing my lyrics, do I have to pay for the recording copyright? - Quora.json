            "answer_text": "In the music business, monetary disbursements are the quickest way to \u201cgrease the skids\u201d and make things happen. If you *really wanna create something* then come up with a budget of about $2500/song; that will cover hiring real professionals that can compose and produce your ideas for you and you\u2019ll end up with a CD eventually. Having a \u201cconcept\u201d of melody that you base your lyrics around makes it easier but it\u2019s not necessary. Neil Peart wrote all the lyrics for the band Rush while Geddy Lee & Alex Lifeson (bassist/guitarist) crafted the tonal arrangements, if I recall correctly. Doing things \u201con the cheap\u201d will require you to \u201cstart a band\u201d and find musicians who want to donate their time to collaborate on musical ideas. This route is often the most painful, as you\u2019ll rarely find quality players who can/wish to donate a couple of nights a week to ultimately what becomes \u201cyour art\u201d. Sometimes \u201clightning strikes\u201d and you meet someone with whom your lyrical abilities pair well with and you become a team. The next step is to create an arrangement and hire session musicians to play on your songs and produce a work of art. The more prepared you are musically (melody & harmony, rhythms, tempos and arrangements) and lyrically going into a recording studio the better. If your \u201cend game\u201d is to make money off your songwriting abilities, then you need to have something out there that piques peoples\u2019 interest; a curation of your creations that is otherwise known as a CD. However\u2026 it\u2019s perfectly OK to do things piecemeal and create one tune, put it on a streaming service for others to listen to and then you can start building a fanbase organically. There\u2019s a great book called \u201cHow To Make It In The New Music Business\u201d by Ari Herstand that breaks down a lot of \u201chow things work now\u201d. The \u201coldschool\u201d music business is a dying dinosaur due to streaming services and the like. Organic fans are the best fans because you tend to get to know them personally and they can say \u201cI knew [your name] back when they were just getting started\u201d. There\u2019s a LOT of \u201cunknowns\u201d who have made millions on songwriting and continue to do so. Publishing is the \u201cbig money\u201d in the music business, such as getting your tune into a movie or commercial. It\u2019s just knowing to whom and where to sell them. Art is hard. Otherwise everyone would be doing it\u2026 actually everyone IS doing it so the \u201cend game\u201d should always be \u201cdo it for the love. If you make any money then consider yourself lucky.\u201d ~13 ",

            "answer_text": "If you want the copyright to be registered, someone\u2019s going to have to pay the registration fee. You could negotiate the contract so that the singer is the one who has to pay it, but if you do so, the singer is likely to up their price by the cost of the registration. It makes more sense to do it yourself. In the US, at least, registering a copyright is not at all difficult, and can be done via the Copyright Office\u2019s web site. ",
