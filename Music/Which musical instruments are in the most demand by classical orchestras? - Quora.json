            "answer_text": "High school musician here. From what I\u2019ve seen in youth orchestras and other youth musical organizations, I think that the harp is in the most demand. Of course, most of the pieces that youth orchestras perform don\u2019t require a harp, but due to the lack of harp players, it\u2019s sometimes difficult to play pieces that require a harp. I think there are mainly two reasons why harp players are so rare in youth orchestras. Students fear that colleges won\u2019t think that playing a harp is a big deal. What I mean is this. Violins have a reputation for being a difficult instrument to master. Flutes have a reputation for being able to make a beautiful sound. But when you think of the harp\u2026 what comes into your mind? Not much, probably. I think this type of reaction from college application reviewers is what students fear.Harps are kind of expensive. I mean, most professional orchestra instruments are above $10,000, but even the smaller and cheaper harps cost at least $1,500. Bigger and better quality harps can go up to $150,000. Yea\u2026 not many students would be able to afford this.I hope this helped. Cheers!  ",

            "answer_text": "Good and true answers here. The real answer though is the one you don\u2019t have and don\u2019t have in your electronic Rolodex. An example might be the Euphonium, needed for a solo in the Ravel orchestration of Mussorgsky\u2019s \u201cPictures at an Exhibition.\u201d Euphonium players don\u2019t usually hang around in classical orchestra circles. We are lucky here in Washington DC for we have the service bands resident here. So we can usually find one of suitable skill to engage him. One of my favorite stories was when the National Symphony (the local pro Orchestra) was doing the Bartok Violin Rhapsodies. Bartok scored a cimbalom for it and no one in the symphony knew of a player or even where to find the instrument. Then someone in the orchestra remembered that a local Hungarian restaurant occasionally had live music by \u201cBaron Bela\u201d who played the cimbalom. He was auditioned. He actually had played the piece in Budapest years earlier. and did the gig. I believe this was in the 1970s. The story of finding him was written up in the local newspaper. ",
