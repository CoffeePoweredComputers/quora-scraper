            "answer_text": "Ah, The Sweet - one of the more underrated glam rock acts of the 70s in my humble opinion. All told they had well over a dozen UK top 40 hit singles during the 1970s, many penned by the production team of Nicky Chinn & Mike Chapman. \u201cBlock Buster\u201d was the most successful of them (reaching #1 in 1973), whilst four more songs reached #2 - \u201cFox on the Run\u201d, \u201cBallroom Blitz\u201d, \u201cHell Raiser\u201d and Teenage Rampage\u201d. They also had chart success overseas with albums such as \u201cSweet Fanny Adams\u201d \u201cDesolation Boulevard\u201d, \u201cGive Us A Wink\u201d \u201cOff the Record\u201d and \u201cLevel Headed\u201d, though oddly none of them charted here in Britain - their only chart appearances came via compilations (\u201cStrung Up\u201d reached #9 in 1975 and \u201cBallroom Hitz\u201d #15 two decades later) Later in the 1970s, they moved into harder rock territory and started writing their own material - unfortunately that move coincided with a decline in their popularity and growing internal tensions (mainly stemming from frontman Brian Connolly\u2019s alcohol abuse) and their last big chart hit (though perhaps their best) coming in January 1978 with the wonderful \u201cLove is Like Oxygen\u201d (from the album \u201cLevel Headed\u201d, as seen below) - they would tour extensively in support of that album through the summer, but then part company with Connolly in November that year. Thee three remaining members soldiered on , with bassist Steve Priest handling most lead vocal duties, until 1981, when the band finally called it a day and split.[1] All three members would continue to make music and even tour as their own respective versions of Sweet through the 1980s and beyond. Sadly though, only guitarist Andy Scott is still with us as of 2020 as the other three original members of the classic line up have all passed away - Connolly succumbed to liver failure & heart problems aged just 51 in February 1997, drummer Mick Tucker to leukaemia in 2002 (aged 54) and bassist Priest this past June aged 72. Scott\u2019s version of the band continues to tour and appears regularly on the 70s heritage circuit throughout Europe. They've been quoted as influences by a whole range of fellow rock musicians & bands and several of their tracks have been covered by others, including \u201cAction\u201d & \u201cHell Raiser \u201c(Def Leppard), \u201cNo You Don\u2019t\u201d(Pat Benetar), \u201cAC/DC\u201d (Joan Jett) \u201cSet Me Free\u201d (Saxon) and \u201cBallroom Blitz\u201d (Krokus)[2]  Footnotes[1] The Sweet - Wikipedia[2] Covers of Sweet Songs",

            "answer_text": "Sweet was one of, if not, the greatest Glam Rock bands ever to come out of the 1970\u2019s. With early songs by them penned by Mike Chapman and Nicky Chinn, I could count at least four Top 10 Hits: Ballroom Blitz, Little Willy, Love Is Like Oxygen & Fox On The Run- plus so many other great songs that were covered by other bands, in later years, Pat Benatar version of \u201cNo You Don\u2019t\u201d Joan Jett version of \u201cAC/DC\u201d, Def Leppard and Steve Stevens cover version of \u201cAction\u201d, Heathen and Vince Neil both did a cover of \u201cSet Me Free\u201d - Krokus and Tia Carrere did Ballroom Blitz, Girlschool did \u201cFox on the Run\u201d Poison did a version of \u201cLittle Willy\u201d - What a great influence they had on so many artists throughout the years. What came next for this band after a string of many, hit singles and LPs. In 1979 Lead singer Brian Connolly was booted from the band from alcoholism and lack of stage performance not up to par. The group tried to continue as a trio with guitarist Andy Scott, drummer Mick Tucker and leaving bassist Steve Priest singing lead. Meanwhile Glam Rock Music diminished and the band further splintered, Each member tried touring as their own unit of SWEET. There were reunions in the later years but the death of Brian Connolly, then Mick Tucker and now in June 2020 Steve Priest having passed away, Andy Scott is the only sole living heir to the classic band who once called themselves SWEET. If you get a chance, pick up the latest Septemebr 2020 issue of GOLDMINE magazine to read what Andy Scott has to say about being the \u201cLast Man Standing\u201d and his insights and recollections to the once dominating Glam Rock band called SWEET.
