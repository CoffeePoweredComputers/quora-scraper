I decided to break it down based on EP, album and single releases in chronological order removing any duplicates and translated versions of songs and adding in any special releases at the end. I hope the list below may be useful. It shows the actual number by giving all the song titles, where they appeared, and dates of release. Twice has been working in overdrive to put out a wide range of fine music. I provided the writer\u2019s of the songs sometimes especially when they were written by Twice members but maybe not all.
