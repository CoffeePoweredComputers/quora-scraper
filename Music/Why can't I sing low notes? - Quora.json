            "answer_text": "PLEASE READ THIS ANSWER BEFORE WRITING YOUR OWN ANSWERS! Since you can't add question details anymore (that sucks), I'm writing the question details in an answer. So in music class we have to pick songs and sing them on Friday. We can't just sing them; we have to sing them to karaeoke backing music. I was thinking about singing Ariana Grande-One Last Time but my voice isn't low enough to sing to the music. Whenever I sing that song without the music, my voice automatically goes higher. I tried to find a karaeoke version of One Last Time on a higher key, but I can't find one. I asked a couple kids in music class, but they just told me to pick a different song. My voice is too high to sing Sigala-Came Here For Love, Sia-Cheap Thrills, Taylor Swift-Wildest Dreams, Sia-The Greatest and a ton of other songs. Whenever I sing them without music, I make them higher to fit my voice, but if I do that it won't sound good with the music. I only have to make Clean Bandit-Symphony a few notes higher but it still won't go with the music. One time, I was singing James Bay-Let It Go in music class when I was told to sing it lower. I tried but my voice went quiet and I couldn't sing some of the lowest notes at all. How do I sing a song in music class when my voice is too high to sing to karaeoke music? I'll get a detention if I don't! ",

            "answer_text": "It sounds like you are in an unworkable situation. As a teacher, I understand the budget limitations and other factors that may require a music teacher to rely on karaoke soundtracks, especially if they are trying to keep your interest by using modern pop music. If you wanted to sing a more classical piece, your teacher could probably accompany you on piano in any key you wanted. Of course, I also recognize that this karaoke solution is not a very good one - it\u2019s an adequate compromise at best. Unfortunately, your vocal range is very much a product of your genes. You have to work with the voice you have and it is not a very good practice to force a student to sing in a key that is not comfortable in their vocal range. That being said, there is plenty you can do to make the most of it and extend your vocal range to its highest potential. There are a number of vocal exercises you can google or get from a good vocal coach that can help you find notes you never thought you had. If that is not enough, I suggest you keep looking for a piece that is closer to your range - you may not enjoy it as much but you will get the marks and avoid detention! ",
