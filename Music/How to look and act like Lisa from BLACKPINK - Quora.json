            "answer_text": "Since no one doesn\u2019t want to actually answer your question, I\u2019ll be that nice person and ACTUALLY ANSWER IT!: Well, to start, you could try listening to subliminals on YouTube for her body, face, personality, and/or talents. If you don\u2019t know, subliminals are messages that go to your subconscious mind and change stuff. It\u2019s not scary at all, you just gotta get used to it! Other ways could be wearing some clothes she wears (or something similar) or getting her hairstyle, along with one of her hair colors (if you want). For the personality, try watching some videos and observing how she acts. If you\u2019re talking about talents, then practice HER dance choreography for Blackpink dances, and maybe even take some dance class or teach yourself. Same goes for rapping and singing, too. Hope this helped! ",

Some people might not like your appearance, but I know someone does. Please realize that you don\u2019t need to look like someone else to be considered \u201cbeautiful\u201d. \u201cAttractive\u201d isn\u2019t only your looks, it\u2019s about your talent, your smartness, your personality and more. You should be comfortable about yourself, and I know it\u2019s not easy. Now, how can you act like Lisa? You can\u2019t. Lisa\u2019s personality is great, but yours is amazing as well. If you change, people will consider you as a \u201ckoreaboo\u201d. Your reputation would be worse. If your personality is boring to you, try something new. You don\u2019t need to act like Lisa to have a great personality. Your personality defines you, not someone else\u2019s. Appreciate your looks, appreciate your personality, appreciate yourself. ",
