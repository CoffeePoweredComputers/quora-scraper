            "answer_text": "Who's your favorite K-pop group between Loona and Dreamcatcher? Why?  FIGHT!! I asked this question but was hesitant to answer because I like both. A LOT. Let's have a look. Dreamcatcher: a failed group from 2014 that was completely reinvented with a darker tone with rock influences. Amazing dance routines. Relies too heavily on the electric guitar, but it works. They kill cover dances. Kill them! Their music is powerful, with sultry but creepy live performances. They open \u201cYou & I\" with vampire attacks\u2026  Shots to the head\u2026  Oh my God, lol. I love this group! Their title songs\u2019 MV's are very supernatural but their b-sides vary. Still, it's the titles that set the stage for a group. They are conceptually hardcore semi-horror. Nobody else in K-pop is doing that. It's a ballsy move. Loona: a relatively new group that debuted in the craziest way ever. Each member was introduced over time with her own song and video. Their little company that supposedly employs under 20 people, sprung for the price of 12 solo projects to intro their group. Holy shit I love that. That's truly believing in their product. They also do great cover dances. In fact, I found them before Dreamcatcher and was immediately impressed by their dancing. They aren't as fiery as Dreamcatcher but they expertly manage their huge team on the stage. These two moves from \u201cButterfly\" are mind-blowing.   They aren't changing any games with their music but what they do, they do it awesomely. Loona and Dreamcatcher both appeal to me in many ways. Both vocals are comparable. Their names are easy. Loona and Dreamcatcher. Not D8FZ21 or some shit I have to look up to understand. I called 2NE1 \u201cTo Anyone\" for five goddam years before I understood how to really say it. I don't like big teams, so that's a deduction for Loona. But I wonder about Dreamcatcher's mass appeal. They're kinda niche and that won't help them down the line. The groups are so similar in their abilities that it would take something minor like that to deduce an outcome. Loona wins. Wait a minute. I just bitched about Dreamcatcher's concept when that's what I love about them? I don't want them to do anything else. That was a crazy thing to write. Okay. Okay, I can't choose. I want them both. Fuck it, it's a tie.  Thanks for reading. ",
