            "answer_text": "I asked a similar question during a discussion on the Gibson Forum.. we were looking for someone who had an influence much like Slash did on the Les Paul.. we didn\u2019t find any definitive answers. I started to like SG\u2019s because Andy Cairns* played one in the \u2018Nowhere\u2019 video.. he played an black Gibson SG Special. It depends what style of music you like.. I mean there are LOADS of famous people of other genre\u2019s I have never heard of, because I don\u2019t like that style of music. Like the other guys said: Robbie Krieger is prolly the most famous out and out Rock guitarist that played SG, Angus Young the most famous Hard Rock guitarist, Tommi Iommi the most famous Metal guitarist.. none of them like Slash and the Les Paul. As a lead guitar, the SG has never really made it\u2019s mark, as a rhythm instrument, yeh plenty of guitarists use it, even as a second instrument. Many Strat players also like SG\u2019s. I am one of them\u2026 what do I *normally* use for lead? prolly a Strat.. *this was when \u2018Therapy?\u2019 was a grunge/pop-metal band, before they became satanists :( ",

            "answer_text": "Glenn Tipton (Judas Priest) - He used an ebony version of the SG which really fits his stage presence. Angus Young (AC/DC) - Probably the most famous example of an SG user and even has his own signature model. Tony Iommi (Black Sabbath) - Tony loved SG\u2019s and has played them throughout his career. Frank Zappa - He also played SGs a good amount and popularized them a lot. Jerry Garcia (Grateful Dead) - I'm not a huge Deadhead but I'm positive Jerry played a lot of SGs in his Grateful Dead days. Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton and Pete Townshend all played SGs sometimes but not a lot. Oh and by the way, if you are researching SGs, go buy one right now. I've owned a lot of guitars, but SGs are some of the best guitars ever. NOW GET OFF OF QUORA AND GET A DAMN SG! ",
