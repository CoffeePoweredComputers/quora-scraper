            "answer_text": "Okay, Jennie is a terrible rapper and idol and let me tell you why. I saw this question and I\u2019m so grateful, I really need to rant about her, she pisses me off so much. (Please read this to the end I mention different points) Oh my gosh, okay, so, Jennie can\u2019t even rap live! She literally is so out of breath and pitchy when she sings or raps live and she has no energy or stage presence like ugh she\u2019s so terrible it annoys me so much.   Remember their debut performance? Jennie was being so lazy and she didn\u2019t care about the other members at all. She was so out of it and so unprofessional and had no energy. She didn\u2019t even interact with fans at all. See?  She has her own style and swag and feel into her rap, like ugh imagine actually having emotion and power in your rap? And expertly using inflection in your voice?   Imagine being so versatile you could rap insanely fast, or casually ride the beat, or rap badass as hell, or rap with so much sorrow and emotion, or rap so softly but with so much power and soul at the same time? Like ugh so disgusting and so terrible! 1:44  There\u2019s even this performance where she wrote her own rap lyrics and was actually into the performance. Like imagine being that disrespectful? Need I say more?  \u2014 If you couldn\u2019t tell this was all sarcasm. Jennie might not be the best rapper but people seriously need to respect her because she worked her ass off for 6 years and did not make it in the biggest Korean entertainment company and debut as an idol because she was talentless or a shitty rapper. She clearly is a good rapper, even if she isn\u2019t the best. So give the girl some respect and love.  (And yes she\u2019s written her own lyrics before, she did it for every monthly assessment and is currently still practicing it as well as producing. Let\u2019s be real, YG doesn\u2019t give the same opportunities to his female idols as he does to his male idols. 2NE1, BLACKPINK, it\u2019s obvious. He just wants to use them to make money, and that\u2019s solely it, he wants to do it in the least risky and most efficient way possible. And it\u2019s also obvious YG\u2019s values have changed to adapt to the current trends. YG has gone from a trendsetter to another company who follows the trends. Notice how he\u2019s focusing more on having visuals such as with blackpink and treasure. Notice how his earlier groups like 2ne1 and bigbang both had way more opportunity to showcase their talent or were focused more on the talent and innovative side of music. But now YG is just trying to make formula groups. sigh..) ",
