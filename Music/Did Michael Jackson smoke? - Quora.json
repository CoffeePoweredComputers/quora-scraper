            "answer_text": "Michael Jackson did not smoke. Neither was he a drinker. However, he would engage in a glass of wine ,one and no more! Michael Jackson had a very strong personality and could not be easily influence into doing things he felt was wrong. Substance abuse. This is why he stayed away from the Hollywood parties. This is not to say he didn't sneak into a night club or two incognito with a woman. He never ventured into strip clubs. Madonna tried to get Michael to go with her into a strip club but he told her ,no! I believe she got devilish over it, and he made her history. Michael Jackson was a passive agressive type. If he didn't want to see you again because you did something wrong, he wouldn't embarrass you to tell you, he would just ice you out! And, he iced out Madonna. Lisa Marie Presley said he pushed her out, I doubt push is the right word. Push innotates touching. Michael would never do it. To describe her experience is to \u2018ice out'. This is what he did to her. Hence why she had to get Janet, Rebbie ,Katherine and Joseph Jackson to help her to get back in. All the rumours that Michael Jackson dated Lisa Marie Presley for four years after the divorce is BS. That's Lisa Marie Presley saying it after Michael's 2009 death. If Michael wanted an annulment after three months of marriage from Lisa Marie means \u201cMichael was anxious to get out!\u201d It had to be Michael Jackson being put into a compromising position by family. Michael Jackson' s family brought Lisa Marie Presley near him! To his events on her request. Michael Jackson said it himself to the Rabbi Schuley that he was done with her, and that Lisa Marie was writing him letters begging him to give her another chance. Lisa Marie Presley even told MJ that she would have 9 children for him. Michael Jackson was no longer interested in Lisa Marie Presley. Michael Jackson was back together with his girlfriend who he had from 1979 in his life. The girl he loved. The girl that Bill Whitfield said he was always in the back of the limosuine smooching. Michael always called her \u201c My baby\u201d. In one of Michael Jackson's songs he said \u201c I don't know why I do the things I do for you!\u201d In another song he declared : \u201c I like the way you become helpless!\u201d Michael Jackson said this because he took care of his woman. He shampooed and conditioned her hair ,and loved doing it. He blow dried it after. He chose her clothes and jewels to wear. He would even do her make up. This was his baby and he loved it. Michael Jackson did a bit of marijuana to have sex. The high made the sex experience phenomenal. Michael tailor's brother was who gave him his first smoke when he was twenty. Michael didn't think marijuana should be criminalised. Cigarettes Michael Jackson thought was a bullet, a slow bullet! He would say to a smoker. \u201c I hope you arranged your funeral.\u201d Adding,\u201d please don't leave your suicide for someone else to fit the bill. Do it yourself!\u201d Paris Jackson has done things that Michael would not have liked. Her tatooes , her smoking, drinking, consuming of drugs and exposing her sexuality publicly.. Michael Jackson would be adhorred about it. Considering how he was judged negatively in the media and tabloids. He would think she was adding nails to his crucifixtion. If Michael was alive, he and Paris would have had fights over her behaviour. However, she was raped at 14 years old and he would just have prayed and asked his fans to pray for Paris. However, Paris is on a right path now. Just hope she continues upward. ",

            "answer_text": "I never saw Michael Jackson smoke. I know he was a health freak for most part of his life, especially in his early youth. Apparently, during the 2005 trial it became known that he drank wine which he put in a refreshment can so as not to set a bad example for his kids. According to Frank Cascio he did indeed refer to it as \u201cJesus Juice\u201d but not to lure kids, as the Arvizos alleged, far from it. His bodyguards gave an interview after he died in which he said he asked for marijuana from time to time, which they found in his bedroom when he died too. He probably didn\u2019t use it though because it was rotten, which is why they thought it was heroin at first . No marijuana or other illegal drugs or alcohol was found in his system when he died. According to Frank Cascio\u2019s book \u201cMy friend Michael Jackson\u201d, Michael Jackson had some marijuana moments as Barry Gibb convinced him that cannabis awakens creative ideas so they lit a joint in the recording studio and ran through the mountains of Neverland to get high from time to time.  According to his autopsy report he had no arteriosclerosis which is extremely rare for a 50 year old man and almost impossible for a smoker. His lungs were indeed collapsing but due to his addiction to demerol and lupus, it does not mention cigarette use. In addition, his lungs were severely damaged because he was anesthetized to sleep for quite a long time without respiratory equipment. Also, he was a Jehovah Witness so according to his religious beliefs he wouldn\u2019t smoke as Jehovah Witnesses do not approve of illegal substances, alcohol, tobacco. Of course, during the later years of his life, he hardly stuck to those values. He often resorted to sedatives and alcohol, he often ate junk food, he was less disciplined than he was in his youth, self-destructive even. The only picture i have ever seen with Michael Jackson with a cigarette was during the Bad tour but he is only holding it he is not actually smoking. However, two empty packs of American Spirit Cigarettes were among the items found in Michael\u2019s master bathroom, which is different from the room that he died, so they would not belong to Conrad Murray. That doesn\u2019t make a fact that he smoked however. Incidentally this brand is what Lisa Marie used to smoke but i doubt they were hers. Also, Michael Jackson did not like women who smoked. He said in a magazine in Brazil: \u2018\u2019I can\u2019t stand how it makes your teeth look and how it makes your breath smell. Most of all I am afraid of the diseases you get from it\u2019\u2019. He certainly didn\u2019t smoke in his youth. Whether he smoked later on in life as he was burdened with many problems, not entirely unlikely. ",

            "answer_text": "Anyone who says he did, don\u2019t know what they are talking about!! And that includes Frank Cascio!!!! No he hated cigarettes and he didn't dare smoke with being a singer because they will destroy vocal chords!! I had an ex Friend who was a smoker and if he caught her with one he grabbed it out of her mouth and dropped it on the ground and ground it out with his foot,he didn't want cigarettes around his children and his son Blanket was there around my ex Friend and he didn't want Blanket to see that and be influenced by the cigarettes!! And he would be very upset with the choices that Paris is making with her life.He raised her to be a respectful and beautiful long haired princess not a short spikey haired tattooed looks like a boy who has a foul mouth on her. No Michael Jackson did not smoke period!! And he wasn't a closet smoker either!! That crap is B.S.!! I didn\u2019t say Mike would be disappointed with his daughter Paris choices she\u2019s made in her life. I said he would be upset over some of the things she is doing. Like the tattoos, smoking cigarettes and her and Prince, smoking pot, and Paris being disrespectful with people and cursing in public. Michael cursed himself so he couldn\u2019t have gone off on his Princess too much or he\u2019d be a hypocrite. But the other stuff he would tell her and Prince \u201cWe are going to talk!!\u201d Mike was an old fashioned type of guy, who wouldn\u2019t be happy with his daughter using her body to display art work. He wouldn\u2019t have stopped her, but he wouldn\u2019t have been happy with her decisions. I knew Michael for twelve years and our personalities were just alike, actually as he said the only difference is he was male and I\u2019m female,(and I can\u2019t dance) We could practically read each other\u2019s minds even through a computer and thousands of miles away. Michael considered me family. So I can definitely say what he would say and feel about his children. I understand they are angry at him for dying, (I am too) but he had so much going on at the end of his life. He was mixed up and sick, and was being pushed to his death. I know he was murdered. So I don\u2019t blame them one bit for having him taken away from them because they were just kids and they needed their dad. Debbie Rowe is not a mom, she agreed to be a surrogate mother and she signed a contract with Michael for Prince and Paris, and she gave birth to them, then she gave up her parenting responsibilities and rights to Michael Jackson. She put Michael through hell when they were married and he didn\u2019t want her involved with them because she had been a bad influence. He wasn\u2019t perfect either. But he was a great father. He didn\u2019t want his children to fall into the same traps of fame he was in. He wanted his kids to do better than he did. And he wouldn\u2019t want them harming their bodies with substance abuse and Paris with her tattoos. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, sometimes. He was what I called, a closet smoker, mainly when he was drinking Jack Daniels. I never asked him what brand, but he did ask me, what do you smoke? I could always tell when he was smoking because I could hear him exhaling when we were talking on the phone. Michael had vices just like most of us. He was a great entertainer, but first he was a human being. But I had to edit this to add that Michael really was a secret smoker, detectives even found empty cigarette packs in his room after he died, and it seems like his daughter is following in his footsteps, only she's open about it. As some of you may know, Paris was caught by ok magazine smoking while waiting for a table with friends, and in the mirror uk, the headline reads, \" Paris slams smoking critics \", and said that smoking is the least bad thing that she could be doing right now. She also talks about it on her Instagram. Even though I know for myself that Michael smoked, and even though they found empty cigarette packs in his room, nobody believes he smoked. But he did, not much, but he did, and that's the truth! So I guess when people see pictures of Paris smoking, they'll find excuses to deny that as well. Just because Michael smoked once in a while didn't make him a bad person, far from it. It just meant that he was a human being, not a God. It's one thing to be a fan, and another to be a fanatic who can't see fact from fiction, or thinks that their favorite celebrity can do no wrong. ",

            "answer_text": "I would prefer not to comment about Michael smoking, despite the fact that I see him holding a cigarette in a certain photo back in the backstage of the Bad Tour with him in a hoodie. It might just be for fun, but the way he holds the cigarette is intriguing as it shows he has held one before - he knew how to hold it like a smoker. Although it isn\u2019t shown that he smokes, that photo shows that he might - but in secret. Again, Michael is a human - just like all of us, although he has way more good characteristics than the bad ones. We should respect him if he had smoked - it was his choice, and no one should judge him for making that choice. Say he didn\u2019t - it will just be a misunderstanding, and we\u2019ll just apologise for our lack of knowledge before we accused him. It\u2019s actually that simple - he\u2019s influential, he\u2019s always being watched by all of us due to his insane popularity when he was alive - but I believe we should give him peace and some privacy pertaining to this. I hope this answer has helped you! ",

(Meaning: to try and live a normal life, addicted to opiates is next to impossible-(u have to wake up and do it, or u will be deathly sick\u2026 so u wake up needing a fix to get u going\u2026*example- u check your blood sugar and it's close to 800 B4 breakfast ....and u already left for work, forgetting to take your insulin.+ My own experience claims being sick is worse then anything+. eventually the opiates will kill u -using too much or sadly, not using enough- withdrawals r serious, and in some cases if not treated, can cause death). Next he not only used opiates, but also basic Tranquilizers( his reasoning- to help him sleep at night). My opinion, Michael Jackson dreaded living at all anymore\u2026 addiction is extremely powerful. Back to the question, I never read, or heard he was a smoker\u2026 but his cause of death was a big shocker as well. ",
