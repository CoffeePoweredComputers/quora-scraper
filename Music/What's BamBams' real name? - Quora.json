            "answer_text": "\"Bambam\" is not a fake or made up stage name. It's a nickname that's still his real name and was given to him by his parents. Everyone calls him Bambam on and off camera. \"Kunpimook Bhuwakul\" From what I\u2019ve read about Thai culture, everyone is given a legal name (the longer one) that\u2019s used for legal documents etc. and a nickname. Their names tend to be long, because you're not supposed to have the same name as others unless your related. Sometimes people don't even know their friends full name. Also, some people for religious or superstitious reasons add words that carry special meanings to their names. For example, \"porn\" is common in a lot of Thai names because it means blessings. Most of the time their nicknames don\u2019t have much relation to the longer one. [1] These things can be seen with other Thai idols as well. Ten ( NCT ) = Chittaphon LeechaiyapornkulSorn ( CLC ) = Chonnasorn SajakulMinnie ( G-idle ) = Minne Nicha YontararakNichkhun ( 2pm ) = Nichkhun Buck HorvejkulLisa ( Blackpink ) = Pranpriya Manoban *legally changed first name to LalisaBambam's siblings are named Baby, Beer, and Bank. He once said that his mom named him Bambam after the cartoon character from Flintstones because he\u2019s strong.  People always think it isn't his real name. He has repeated it on a couple occasions like here: EXCLUSIVE (Part 1): K-Pop sensation GOT7 on Good Day New York. If you click on it, I included the time stamp where he says it which should work. I hope this was informative and wasn't too confusing and at least cleared some things up. Footnotes[1] Thai Culture: Thai names explained, why are they so long and weird?",
