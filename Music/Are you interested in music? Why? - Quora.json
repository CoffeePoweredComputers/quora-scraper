            "answer_text": "At the moment, I have a great interest in music. This began at around the age of seven. At that stage, it wasn't so much of an \"interest\" as it was the knowledge that if I signed up to learn violin, I'd get out of maths once a week to attend lessons. I had little interest in the instrument other than that. At that age, I hated the way music was taught as a subject at school and the only kind of music I was exposed to was what my parents listened to - 80's and 90's pop, 70's punk rock. I remember pretending to enjoy what my parents liked for their validation and appreciation, but I didn't really develop my own taste in music until I was around eleven when I'd begin to hear songs I liked on the radio and listen to them on Youtube, which would recommend similar songs that I liked. Now I'm sixteen, and music is one of the biggest aspects of my life. I must have started listening to classical music when I was about fourteen, and I'm still constantly blown away with different pieces and composers. I switched from playing in a traditional Scottish style to playing primarily in classical, and there's something immensely rewarding in playing even simple pieces; I find it so surreal that I can make such beautiful sounds with an inanimate object. I think it's fascinating that some of the pieces I play and listen to were composed hundreds of years ago by people who probably had no idea that their work would still be taught today. I become more interested in and appreciative of music the more I listen to. I'm currently taking graded exams in violin, guitar, and vocals with the hopes of reaching grade eight in the latter. I also have a significant list of instruments I'd like to learn, like piano and cello. Music helps me to feel better. It calms me down when I'm anxious; I can sit and listen to a classical symphony and try to pick out the instruments and concepts to take my mind off what's worrying me. It helps me connect with my friends; I listen to all of their recommendations and develop a greater understanding of them with each one. It helps me knuckle down and study without distractions. It helps me make friends with a wider community of classical musicians who share my passions. I hope to retain my interest in music throughout adulthood. I'd like to take it as a degree at some point, and maybe become a music teacher or music therapist. I'd like to instill an interest in music in others so that it can benefit them as it did me. ",

I\u2019ve had a mild interest in music even when I was a young child, but I was too insecure to pursue a career in professional musicianship, even though many of my relatives are professional musicians or teachers. I started playing guitar as a teenager due to my love of heavy metal music. It was great relief and a way to bond with my brother. We played in a band for a while, had some fun. Nowadays I play less, but I still enjoy the various ways that people find to express their emotions through music. Technology has added a great variety of options in the way that people can compose, perform and what kind of tones they can reach. It\u2019s all pretty fascinating. ",
