            "answer_text": "One of the more comprehensive studies found that the African American population spans the entire breadth of African genetic composition, from 1% to 100%, with the most frequent being 80\u201382%, and the population average being 73%.[1]  However, after falling to 26%, it was significantly less likely for the individuals to self-identify as \u201cAfrican American\u201d. My personal experiences would corroborate this, as individuals who in the past might have been labeled as \u201coctoroons\u201d or some other designation denoting very low African ancestry tend not to gravitate towards a black ethnic identity (although some may still identify as a 'person of color'). What is more interesting to me, though, is that at the very end (0\u20134%), African American self-identification shoots up again \u2013 a lot! There was a report of a woman in West Virginia a few years ago who was found to be 1% black genetically, but was raised in a historically black community, had African American heritage, and self-identified as African American. So, the answer is that there is no blood quantum required to be African American, which is very ironic in an American context if you think about it. White people are generally thought of as being around 100% white. Native Americans usually require at least 1/16th Native ancestry to be a part of their tribe. But, any amount of blackness can allow one to qualify as black. While black people may just be much less exclusive than other groups, it also underscores that being African American encompasses more than genetics \u2013 it also involves culture and history.

            "answer_text": "During the times of slavery and sometime after during Jim Crow, there was the 1/32 rule or 1 drop rule. So someone could look white and still be enslaved. That is part of what drove a lot of abolitionists in the North. There were also people in this category with more European genetics than African that decided to pass as white if they could for obvious reasons. Beyond that it becomes cultural in how you identify. Who is your family, what do they look like, how were you raised, etc., and it becomes your decision what you put on the census. That is why to us - Meghan, Barack, Halle, Alicia, etc. are black. There are people who identify as multi racial, not because of historical genetics but because of more recent parentage. Vin Diesel, Wentworth Miller, Jennifer Beals, Logic are more ambiguous. So there is no set rule. It is how you identify culturally.  ",
