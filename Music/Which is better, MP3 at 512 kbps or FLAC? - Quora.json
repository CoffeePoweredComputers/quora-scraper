            "answer_text": "Actually, it's MP3, surprisingly. Since FLAC is lossless, you need a lower sampling rate for it to be lossless at that bitrate. Or switch it to mono. Or both. At 512 Kbps you are only guaranteed to get lossless audio with 16 bit mono audio with a 32 KHz sampling rate. If you want stereo, that drops to 16 KHz. MP3 is lossy, but at these high bitrates the lost information is not perceivable by humans so it ends up being higher quality. ",

            "answer_text": "MP3 Bit rates range from 96 to 320 kilobits per second (Kbps). Not sure where a rate of 512 kbps came from. FLAC is always better as it is lossless compression codec vs lossy MP3. 320Kbps MP3 comes very close to 16/44.1 FLAC though. On highly resolving systems there is an audible difference, but it is subtle (details are less precise, compressed low-end, less punch, sound is not as 3D as lossless). I personally always choose FLAC over MP3, otherwise it is at least 320kbps MP3. ",
