            "answer_text": "My answers would only be based on how I see companies on my own perspective since I can't talk about the first-hand experience. Bighit- the musical freedom they are giving BTS all these years will be the best evidence of how they treat their artists. And also, how they handle issues and malicious comments and all thrown to their artists will always make me admire them. Some would say, of course, they will take care of BTS because they are their number 1 money-maker. But talking about the earlier years of BTS, when they still that nugu group, Bighit\u2019s always been protective of their artists. Same goes with TXT.JYP- I really admire also the musical freedom JYP giving Stray Kids nowadays. But I really hate how he promotes GOT7, though. The relationship of JYP between his artists was also admirable. Got7 can joke around him without getting scared that they will be scolded, afterward. LolThat would be all for now. ",

Like, don\u2019t tell me, that if they renewed their contract one year before the expire date means that the company treats them bad. Don\u2019t tell me that band pd treats them badly when bts have pretty easy rules to follow. They are not being starved. They even have the rule of eating at least 3 meals a day to keep themselves healthy. Don\u2019t tell me that bts don\u2019t love bang pd if after they first win, rm basically ran almost crying to hug him. Big hit even tho it\u2019s a small company, it\u2019s the best. ",
