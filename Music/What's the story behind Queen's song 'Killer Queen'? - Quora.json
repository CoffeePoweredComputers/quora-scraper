            "answer_text": "Freddie Mercury: \u201cPeople are used to hard rock, energy music from Queen, yet with this single you almost expect Noel Coward to sing it. It's one of those bowler hat, black suspender belt numbers \u2013 not that Coward would wear that. (...) It's about a high class call girl. I'm trying to say that classy people can be whores as well. That's what the song is about, though I'd prefer people to put their interpretation upon it \u2013 to read into it what they like. Brian May: \u201cKiller Queen' was the turning point. It was the song that best summed up our kind of music, and a big hit, and we desperately needed it as a mark of something successful happening for us... I was always very happy with this song. The whole record was made in a very craftsman-like manner. I still enjoy listening to it because there's a lot to listen to, but it never gets cluttered. There's always space for all the little ideas to come through. And of course, I like the solo, with that three-part section, where each part has its own voice. What can I say? It's vintage Queen. The first time I heard Freddie playing that song, I was lying in my room in Rockfield [a residential recording studio in Wales], feeling very sick. After Queen's first American tour, I had hepatitis, and then I had very bad stomach problems and I had to be operated on. So I remember just lying there, hearing Freddie play this really great song and feeling sad, because I thought, 'I can't even get out of bed to participate in this. Maybe the group will have to go on without me.' No one could figure out what was wrong with me. But then I did go into the hospital and I got fixed up, thank God. And when I came out again, we were able to finish off 'Killer Queen.' They left some space for me and I did the solo. I had strong feelings about one of the harmony bits in the chorus, so we had another go at that too. ",

            "answer_text": "Years later Eric Hall, who was EMI PR man for Queen at the time, revealed that Freddie had a crush on him and told him that the song was about him (Eric) . \u201cshe keeps Moet Et Chandon in her pretty cabinet\u201d refers to Eric\u2019s drinks cabinet always stocked with Moet. The rest of the song is fairly explanatory. It was Queen\u2019s first major hit peaking at No2 and only stopped from getting to No1 by David Essex\u2019s \u201c Gonna Make You A Star\u2019. It helped sales of the Sheer Heart Attack LP too which also made No2, behind the Bay City Rollers album \u201c Rollin\u201d. Not bad for a mainly ( at the time) hard rock group in its relative infancy. The singles charts at the time (1974) were mainly dominated by teenybop and novelty records, and most hard and progressive rock bands at that time concentrated only on albums. There were a few exceptions such as Nazareth, Bachman Turner Overdrive who also had top ten singles at that time, but Queen\u2019s music was more complex and diverse while still maintaining a hard rock base. Killer Queen was a departure from at that time from Queen\u2019s usual hard rock or \u201cglam metal\u201d in any case ",
