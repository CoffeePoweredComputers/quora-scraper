            "answer_text": "In South Africa, it has but also, this could be said of the entire population in general. Generally, our perceptions of American minority culture has been affected this way as well, especially when it comes to Hispanic Americans. As I was growing up, I would see all these white kids playing their rap music, using the slang and donning all the apparel with me playing along due in part to my own boredom that came with suburban life. The Black, Indian and so-called Coloureds would do this albeit for slightly different reasons owing to the majority of them still living in their respective residential areas/townships. It was fun initially until I noticed how the listeners would have the ethnicity of the rappers stereotyped in many ways and not in a good way with a good number of them having these attitudes internalized. Still I played along without giving a second thought. I mean, how could we get to truly know a group of people who lived thousands of kilometers away from us? As I grew older, I realized how bigoted and clueless these white kids turned out to be and discovered how I managed to internalize all of this. Now I learned to not having these kinds of people taken seriously due to their poor grasp of the cultures they are allegedly engaging with. The saddest part was that most of the people who knew and listened to underground/indie/experimental hip-hop happened to be white while the more commercial and hardcore strains was the kinds of hip-hop that entailed the description of hip-hop in the minds of Black South Africa at large. So while my attitudes towards African-American culture has moved into a positive direction, I\u2019m afraid that many of my former friends minds hasn\u2019t quite changed on the matter. Many of my white friends who ended up embracing hip-hop ended up seeing the said community in a more positive light so not all has been lost. ",

            "answer_text": "Rap music has, for many white people, reinforced and even possibly confirmed many negative opinions and stereotypes they may hold. Everybody knows, regardless of their ethnicity, that people are discriminated against wrongly because of their ethnicity. That is a topic for another discussion. Many white people do not see violent and misogynistic rap as merely a social commentary which reflects the community the artists are living in. They see it, sometimes rightly in my opinion, as a glorification of violence and anti-social behavior. Another facet is, for lack of a better term, the tribal aspect of much of black popular culture. As a white man who strives to treat everybody I meet with a certain level of respect and consideration, it often feels to me as if some black people behave in ways to make it clear that as a white person I simply can\u2019t relate to them as equals on a basic level. Like they are members of a club that I can never join. This idea extends to music, dress, language, cars, many aspects of culture. Of course, this concept works both ways, and can be applied to how any group\u2019s opinion is influenced by another\u2019s culture and music. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it may have validated what some people already thought. That blacks are ignorant, violent and poor.  I'm not saying that all rap is like this. In fact, I know it's not. But when you're looking for validation, all you need to do is be able to quote 5 rappers that fit your narrative.  This incidently is true for all things that people negatively associate with blacks. I could point out 100 black people that are doing quite well... but a person will point to about 5 blacks and say, \"see.. they're lazy and ignorant. This is a problem in the black community.\". Completely ignoring the larger amounts of ignorant white people in America (you outnumber us... so you have larger groups of ignorant people as well).  They will instead talk about percentages... unless those numbers don't work in their favor, then they'll go with raw numbers.  ----My point is, yes Rap music has had a negative impact on the opinions of some white people. But those people would just look for another excuse to hate, if we didn't have rap music. ",

            "answer_text": "Has rap music influenced white peoples perception of African Americans? For this white person, yes. Understand, I\u2019m old. When I first watched Bill Cosby it was in I Spy, in which he played a secret agent masquerading as a \u2018tennis bum.\u2019 Then I watched him in The Bill Cosby Show, in which he played a P.E. teacher at an LA high school. In neither series was he a \u2018black\u2019 dude; he was just an actor playing a role in a TV series. Diahann Carroll was still starring in Julia. Race wasn\u2019t a factor in that series, either. Rap hadn\u2019t been invented yet. I grew up listening to Aerosmith and Simon and Garfunkel and Queen and the Eagles and Johnny Mathis. Other than Mathis, none of the other singers that I listened to were black. I knew who Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Nat King Cole, The Platters, The Temptations, Otis Redding, and Sam Cooke were, but I didn\u2019t listen to them \u2013 they were slightly before my time. Then suddenly I was listening to a lot of black singers. I loved Ray Charles, Marvin Gaye, Michael Jackson, Sly and the Family Stone, New Edition, Boyz II Men, Chaka Khan, The Pointer Sisters, Rick James, Minnie Riperton, Sister Sledge, and Stevie Wonder. But I didn\u2019t listen to them thinking about their race \u2013 they were musicians first, black second. Then N.W.A. exploded on the scene, and everyone was aware of black entertainers. By that I mean black entertainers as black entertainers, rather than entertainers who were black. How could you not? Rap was HUGE, instantaneously (or so it felt). And they were shooting each other! Notorious B.I.G. and 2Pac, obviously, but also Kadafi, Soulja Slim, and a host of others whose names I no longer remember. Their lyrics were aggressive, sexual, or both. \"I'm repping 6 Kiss cause I'm smooth like silk/Fuck your ho in the ass and her pussy squirted milk\" \u2013 Lil B And: \u201cAnd still fucking with them freak hoes/Stank pussy smelling like Cool Ranch Doritos\" \u2013 Danny Brown Or: \u201cI got blood on my hands and there's no remorse/And got blood on my dick cause I fucked a corpse\" \u2013 DMX The question is, how could rap music NOT influence white people\u2019s perception of African Americans?

I enjoy reading reviews and discourse on it though, and I believe in following pop music is important for that reason. (My gosh that sounds stuffy, but it's true) I truly enjoy listening to hip hop that expands on the thoughts and feelings of the artist, and if they are black, I accept that their viewpoint is something I do not experience but I can appreciate. I don't think that this viewpoint applies to all of my friends that are black though, and I would rather experience my friends point of view without the distortion of an artists point of view. I have met too many people who could never be categorized by lyrics to think anyone could fit into a song. People are just too damn complex. Listening to hip hop has opened my mind to many different concepts and parts of American reality that I do not experience but it is still artwork. It is not reality. Art is a mirror of reality, but distorted through ego. ",

When they come across a Afro American who is acting contrary to what was depicted on the TV screen, they start to feel uneasy; because in reality they like ignorant negroes, who play the harmonica and tap dance. I'm not speaking out of anger but experience. There are many shows that depict many black stereotypes and non blacks are eating it up. It\u2019s sad but true; many blacks are drawn in and cheer on the negative stereotypes and continue to act them out. We also judge one another using these Negative stereotypes. Yes whites are influenced by them, no doubt. However, blacks we need to step out that role and show that's not who we are. Don't sell yourself short.

With RAP we now know that African Americans live in mansions, ride limos and throw money around like it\u2019s nothing. This kind of fits with assumption that everyone in Americas is rich, regardless of ethnicity, different groups simply have different ways of spending their huge tons of money.

Now i know this may have happened before but it is really apparent these days. it is not a positive thing. people don\u2019t want to be called out for acting out when blacks are around i guess. but it is what it is ",

If you're talking about being \u201cgangsta\u201d there were plenty of flashy Italian, Russian, and British gangsters in the media long before hiphop and rap.
