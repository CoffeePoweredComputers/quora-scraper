            "answer_text": "Amazon Music is a excellent platform. When I meet the wonderful songs, I always want to save the songs which I can listen offline. To download music from Amazon, I have tried Tunecable and Tunepat. They can cancel limits from Amazon Unlimited. Both of them can perfectly download music from Amazon but Tunepat is cheaper. So I will recommend Tunepat. Hope it can help you. ",
