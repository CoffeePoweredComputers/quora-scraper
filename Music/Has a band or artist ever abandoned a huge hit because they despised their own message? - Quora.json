            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a very famous Mexican band called Cafe Tacuba who dumped a HUGE hit called Ingrata when they came to realize how chauvinist, to say the least, the lyrics, with their respective translation are: Ingrata, qu\u00e9 no ves que estoy sufriendo Por favor hoy no me digas que sin m\u00ed te est\u00e1s muriendo Que tus l\u00e1grimas son falsas Ingrata, no me digas que me adoras Se te nota que en tus labios ya no hay nada que t\u00fa puedas Ofrecer a esta boca Por eso ahora yo s\u00e9 que veniste Por que te acuerdas de mi cari\u00f1o Por eso ahora que estoy tan triste No quiero que nadie me mire sufrir Ay ay ay ay ay ay Ingrata, no me digas que me quieres T\u00fa desprecias mis palabras y mis besos los que alguna una vez Hicieron que so\u00f1aras Ingrata, no te olvides que si quiero Pues si puedo hacerte da\u00f1o, solo falta que yo quiera Lastimarte y humillarte Ingrata, aunque quieras tu dejarme Los recuerdos de esos d\u00edas, de las noches tan oscuras T\u00fa jam\u00e1s podr\u00e1s borrarte Por eso ahora tendr\u00e9 que obsequiarte Un par de balazos pa' que te duela Y aunque estoy triste por ya no tenerte Voy a estar contigo en tu funeral Ungrateful, don't you see that I'm suffering Please don't tell me today that without me you are dying That your tears are false Ungrateful, don't tell me that you adore me You can see that there is nothing on your lips that you can Offer this mouth So now I know you came Why do you remember my darling So now that I'm so sad I don't want anyone to watch me suffer Ay ay ay ay ay ay Ungrateful, don't tell me you love me You despise my words and my kisses the one that once They made you dream Ungrateful, don't forget that if I want Well, if I can hurt you, all I have to do is want Hurt you and humiliate you Ungrateful, even if you want to leave me The memories of those days, of the nights so dark You can never erase yourself So now I will have to give you A couple of shots to make you hurt And although I'm sad that I don't have you anymore I will be with you at your funeral ",

            "answer_text": "Abandoned? No! But the list of big name artists that Hate their own hits is staggering! It\u2019s literally the biggest names in the industry. From the post-WWII years to today, there is just something about playing the same song night after night, and month after month. And then being excitedly asked to play it again that grinds some people\u2019s perinea! We\u2019ll start with some biggies\u2026 Frank Sinatra \u201cStrangers in the Night\u201d  Frank not only hated the song after it became a hit, he hated it before it became a hit! Ol\u2019 Blue Eyes claimed he disliked the song when it was first played for him several years before he recorded it. And Sinatra pulls no punches here. Among some of his favorite disses: announcing to the audience \u201chere\u2019s a song I cannot stand\u201d, \u201cIf you liked that song you must be crazy about pineapple yogurt\u201d. He actually complained about the song while singing it! No one did it better than Frank. No one hated a song better than him either! Mylie Cyrus \u201cWrecking Ball\u201d  Mylie is known for hyperboles. We could\u2019ve picked any number of her past hits that she has ex-communicated, especially \u201cParty in the U.S.A.\u201d But it\u2019s one of her early ones, \u201cWrecking Ball\u201d that she has a special dislike for. To quote Mylie: \u201cI\u2019m never living that down. I will always be the naked girl on the wrecking ball\u201d. \u201cWhat was I thinking, I should\u2019ve thought, how long will this follow me around?\u201d Poor Mylie, so misunderstood. Led Zeppelin \u201cStairway To Heaven\u201d  This is probably more a Bob Plant thing than the whole band. Plant told the LA Times in 1988, that he would \u201cbreak out in hives\u201d if he had to sing that song every night! He called \u201cStairway\u201d, \u2018that bloody wedding-song\u2019. In 2002, he even \u2018pledged a donation\u2019 to a Portland radio station that had announced a ban on the song! Now that\u2019s putting your money where your mouth is, or was, or did. Something like that\u2026. Warrant \u201cCherry Pie\u201d  Singer Jani Lane originally wrote the lyrics for \u201cCherry Pie\u201d on the back of a Pizza Box. I think he wishes he ate the damn box too now! The 1990 hit for his band \u2018Warrant\u2019 put the LA Hair-band on the map. But Lane seemed to know that eventually it would come back to bite him. \u201cEverything about the song is me\u201d he chimed. \u201cI\u2019m the Cherry Pie guy\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019ll ever be known by.\u201d Ariana Grande \u201cPut Your Hearts Up\u201d  Pop diva Ariana Grande\u2019s first single is a point of contention, if not a sore spot for her. Said Ariana, \u201cIt was geared towards kids and it felt so inauthentic and fake.\u201d She described shooting the song\u2019s music video as \u201cthe worst moment of my life\u201d. Poo\u2019 ol\u2019 Ariana.. Lorde \u201cRoyals\u201d  \u201dIts disastrous\u201d says the New Zealand singer, when talking about \u201cRoyals\u201d. \u201cNone of the melodies are cool or good\u201d. She even prefers cover versions of the song to her own original version! Now that\u2019s a song worth killing, I mean killing for eh\u2019 Radiohead \u201cCreep\u201d  Radiohead started quickly in 1992 with the hit song \u201cCreep\u201d. The song launched their careers in the music industry and announced their presence on the alternative scene. Unfortunately, the band feels quite differently about it than us fans. Singer Thom Yorke claimed that the song limited the band, and that he felt \u201ctrapped\u201d by its success. All the band members literally \u2018hate the song\u2019 and consistently refer to it as \u201cCrap\u201d. Guitarist Johnny Greenwood even tried to sabotage it in the studio by purposely coming in early during the chorus. They kept the part in the song. I\u2019ve seen Radiohead twice. Come to think of it, they never played \u201cCrap\u201d, I mean \u201cCreep\u201d on those nights. Hmmmm, I thought it was just me\u2026 Last but not least, some honorable mentions of hatred\u2026 Liam Gallagher (Oasis) \u201cWonderwall\u201d The former Oasis singer claims he wanted to \u201cgag\u201d every time he had to sing the song!Beastie Boys \u201c(YouGotta) Fight For Your Right (To Party).\u201d The band claims no one understands it\u2019s really a satire about partying.Kanye West \u201cGold Digger\u201d Said Mr.Kardashian, \u201cNever liked the song, but I knew I would get paid for doing \u2018Gold Digger\u2019.\u201d",

It wasn\u2019t not a great song by not a great band, IMO, relying on outrageous stage antics and gratuitously misogynistic lyrics. But they got some air play . . . Jump ahead a few years and the band\u2019s founder and singer, Blackie Lawless, has experienced a religious conversion. He now refuses to play Animal, despite the fan\u2019s demand for his biggest hit, because he finds the entire message to be completely at odds with his current belief system. ",
