            "answer_text": "BandLab is actually what was formally Cakewalk Sonar\u2019s highest offered product. Which is fully downloadable as it was when it was a quite expensive and very revered and specifically well running and very stable professional DAW on the windows platform. Everything offered now for free includes all but a handful of plugins which were third party plugins (mainly a few instruments) which had prior agreements which dissolved with Cakewalk and its paid version. While somewhat of a complicated story essentially Gibson has purchased Cakewalk a few years ago and during the restructuring after they went bankrupt they essentially abandoned the DAW and all the additional software with it. Nearly all the original staff especially the development & creative staff from cakewalk were still working for Cakewalk and decided to stay and offer the product for free and renamed it BandLab. They went on to develop a multi platform very well developed and fully interchangeably compatible mobile platform production App that works seamlessly with the desktop DAW with a very close but entirely optional interaction with the mobile App which allows users to engage in social creation of music in a unique and very interactive experience. Furthermore, they are actually probably next to the or perhaps even better then Reaper in terms of customer support and fixing to resolution problems their users encounter - odder still they are even more responsive more rapid and helpful then when their customers actually paid for the software. I have no idea exactly how they are doing this and making this model work particularly as I literally work on a quite different team in my job\u2026 however it\u2019s really a remarkable experience and very well developed and solid code. As a DAW I would absolutely recommend and personally use it over many other quite expensive DAWs on the market. ",
