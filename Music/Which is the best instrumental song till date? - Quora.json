            "answer_text": "There have been some amazing instrumental music in the field of contemporary or classical music. I am surprised very less have been mentioned. For starters, almost all orchestral performances of the Vienna Philharmonic and the Johann Strauss Orchestra would be a good start. Many great tracks like Conquest of Paradise (Vangelis), The Blue Danube (Johann Strauss II), tracks from Inception, The Dark Knight, Schindler's List, Game of Thrones, Godfather, The Lord of The Rings, The Last of the Mohicans, Braveheart, Crysis 2, Battlefield, Modern Warfare, etc. have been already shared. Hence, I won't be repeating them. The following are the links to some exceptional orchestral music that I have really liked. If possible, please listen to them in the order prescribed; the magic worked for me! :) 1. Chevaliers de Sangreal (The Da Vinci Code) by Hans Zimmer This particular composition was nothing short of magical when first heard. It was used in the movie The Da Vinci Code, in one of the climactic scenes. One of the many ingenious pieces of Hans Zimmer, this is truly a mesmerising one.   2. La Cumparsita by Gerardo Matos Rodriguez (Becho) If you are looking for a song to dance with your partner, look no further! This tune is the ultimate tango composition ever conceived. Together with Por Una Cabeza, these are the most heard/played tango compositions in the world.   3. Victory by Bond (string quartet) I am sure you've heard this one! This is by the British/Australian string quartet. You'll simply love this, not only because of the beautiful women performing the tune, but also for their explicit way of playing the cello and violins.   4. Waltz No. 2 by Dmitri Shostakovich One of the premier waltz compositions in the world, this tune will make your feet sway from one direction to the other automatically! Composed by Russian master composer Dmitri Shostakovich and performed in almost all philharmonics around the world, Waltz No. 2 is a completely different melody in itself!   5. Kalinka by the Red Army Choir  Nobody messes with the Russians when it comes to singing! Yes, this is a Russian folk song which is generally presented in an opera style of singing. Here, as we can see, is the Red Army Choir (yeah, the real Red Army) performing it. Kalinka is a snowball tree, and this particular tune has been plagiarised and used in a variety of other compositions.   6. The Machine Theme (Person of Interest) by Ramin Djiwadi No other instrumental music can take you from a state of calmness to a hyper active state like this one. Ramin Djiwadi's excellent composition of this theme from the popular TV show Person of Interest has been used all throughout the show and has been one of my top favourites when it comes to choosing instrumental music!   7. Interstellar Main Theme (Interstellar) by Hans Zimmer This had to be included. the music in this film has the expressions to describe each and any kind of emotions. Be it sadness or happiness, you just can't beat this universal piece of music from Interstellar! Thank you, Hans Zimmer.   8. Kaleidoscope of Mathematics (A Beautiful Mind) by James Horner Composed by James Horner, this particular tune was used in the movie A Beautiful Mind based on the life of Nobel Prize winning economist and mathematician John Nash. This tune has an effect which cannot be explained with words. I leave it up to the listeners to deduce it, as you can calmly enjoy it.    9. Ave Maria by Schubert Opera lovers would love this obvious choice. Mind you, this isn't instrumental at all! However, if one is listening to the right version of Ave Maria, you wouldn't be the same again. This is the bomb when it comes to the definition of 'amazing'.    10. John Adams Opening Sequence (John Adams) by Robert Lane Taking the musical tone to a bit adventurous level, this opening sequence is really inspiring. The last time I felt this inspired was when I had heard Vangelis's Conquest of Paradise, but this one surpasses that, according to me! Hope you like it.   11. City of Hope (The King's Speech) by Audiomachine Listen to it. Take a deep breath. Listen to it again. I am sure you will feel different!    12. O Fortuna (Carmina Burana) by Carl Orff Those of you who like Lord of the Rings would agree that this is great! O Fortuna is an excerpt from Carl Orff's epic composition Carmina Burana based on 24 poems from medieval Roman literature. It is a complaint about fate and Fortuna, the Roman impersonation of luck. You will like this one! One of my bests from the collection titled \"Epic Music\"   13. Sands of Time (The Adventures of Tintin) by Audiomachine Remember \"Epic Music\"? Well, this one tops the list. Nothing can give you goosebumps as much as this composition. This tune by Audiomachine is one of the best compositions I have ever heard. It has been used in the trailer background of The Adventures of Tintin (movie).   14. Hungarian Dance No. 5 by Johannes Brahms You must have definitely heard this. Its been often used in many of the cartoon shows. But Brahms' Dance No. 5 is truly a masterpiece in classical music.   15. Hungarian Rhapsody No.2 (Orchestral Version) by Franz Liszt Although it might get dull at some points, nothing can beat the extremities and the change of notes with the amazing element of surprise in the composition composed by Hungarian maestro Franz Liszt.     16. Marriage of Figaro by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Its Mozart! Need I say more? :P   17. Carmen (Overture) by Georges Bizet A very famous tune, has been played in a lot of orchestras and cartoon shows! This is an overture from Carmen by Georges Bizet.   18. Radetzky March by Johann Strauss II This march will definitely make you remember all the old German, French, Prussian, Austrian and what not generals, colonels, kings, princes, etc etc etc from the 19th century. Composed by maestro Johann Strauss II, the Radetzky March is one of the prime military and musical marches ever composed. Here, the march has been conducted in the Vienna Philharmonic by master conductor Herbert von Karajan.   20. Grande Valse Viennoise by Andre Rieu This tone will just make you get up and dance with your favourite partner. Its such a cheerful tone! Grande Valse Viennoise has been performed by the Johann Strauss Orchestra of Andre Rieu.   21. Orpheus in the Underworld (Can-Can) by Jacques Offenbach One of the most famous tunes in fast-paced classical music, you can never forget this tune!! Especially, if you are a die-hard fan of Tom and Jerry and/or Looney Toons (like myself)   22. Ride of the Valkyrie by Richard Wagner Take my advice, and listen to this when you are in an aircraft about to takeoff! You will feel like the king of the world! Ride of the Valkyrie is one of Wagner's most explicit and amazing compositions. It has been used in the Oscar winning movie Apocalypse Now, and is also said to be a favourite of the German dictator Adolf Hitler.   23. Swan Lake by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky This tone is a master deceiver! It will assure you to remain calm and relaxed until the climax, when it hits right on the face and one is not able to experience nothing but awe! A contemporary music for ballet all around the world, Swan Lake has been one of Tchaikovsky's premier compositions. It has been used in the Oscar winning movie Black Swan.   The last two compositions are my two most favourite instrumental songs.  24. Moonshine (Traditional Arrangement) from The Grand Budapest Hotel      Composer: Traditional Russian Folk Music      Director: Alexandre Desplat You will laugh, you will dance, you will shout and you will go crazy! This heavily paced song is a version of a Russian folk song called \"The Moon is to shine\" and has been conducted completely with the help of balalaikas! Hope you enjoy it and hope that you go crazy after listening to it!    25. And the Waltz Goes On.... (Orchestral Version)     Composer: Sir Anthony Hopkins     Director: Andre Rieu & the Johann Strauss Orchestra  Yes, you read it right! Our dear Hannibal Lecter (from the movie series, not show) is also a secret composer. Witness the greatest waltz ever conceived by this man in times of hardness and performed in Vienna by the talented Andre Rieu and his Johann Strauss Orchestra. This instrumental, according to this author, is the best thing one has ever heard!   I really hope you like the suggestions! :) ",

            "answer_text": "I love listening to instrumentals. Some of the ones which really touch me every single time are : 1) Rebel Heart by Corrs. It is such an amazing instrumental with a strong celtic influence,  2) Por Una Cabeza by The Tango Project. Heard this in So You Think You Can Dance (TV series) for the first time and fell in love with it.  3) Sad Violin - This has to be one of the very best instrumentals I have ever heard. So touching.  4) Native Indian Flute Music : Listen to this soothing flute instrumental after a long tiring day. You would thank me for this :)  5) Last of the Mohicans soundtrack : This is one of the best movie instrumental soundtracks IMHO.  ",
