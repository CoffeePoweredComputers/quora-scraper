Next, you\u2019ll click on upload on the bottom of the tool bar on the left side of your screen where you can upload your svg file that you want to cut.Continue on and the image will be loaded onto your blank canvas where you can size the image to what best fits your needs for the project your are doing with it.The technique I like to use to cut my vinyl is simple and quick. I take my green cricut mat and place the appropriate sized vinyl on it.When working with Iron On Vinyl, ALWAYS make sure that you are placing the vinyl shiny side down onto the mat. It will be a thin plastic like covering and that is the side you want facing down on the mat.Click on the green make it button in the top right hand corner in cricut design.Always make sure for any iron on projects that you are doing that you mirror the image.Go ahead and click the green continue button on the bottom right hand side in cricut design.Make sure that the material knob on the cricut machine is set to Iron-On.Load a fine-point blade into clamp B and load the mat into the machine by pushing the load/unload button on the cricut machine underneath the material setting knob. (It should be flashing)Once the mat is loaded, you will press the \u201cgo\u201d button on the machine which if you have done the previous steps correctly, will be flashing. It is the \u201cc\u201d button next to the load/unload button.For a full step by step tutorial guide with pictures on cutting vinyl check out this link here. Best of luck, Morgan ",
