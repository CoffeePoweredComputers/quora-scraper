            "answer_text": "Work FOR you? As in, you\u2019re in charge? All the musical decisions are yours alone, and they\u2019re the hired help brought in to do what you ask? Then you\u2019d better be willing to pay them for their time and skills. If you\u2019ve got a budget, then you can find musicians in lots of places. Call your local AFM (if you\u2019re not in the US, call whatever union or guild represents musicians where you are) and tell them what instruments you\u2019re looking forCall recording studios, producers, etc. and ask for namesNetwork with the musicians you knowPlace ads on Craislist or on musician websitesIf you have no money to offer, ask yourself why anyone would give up their time to be part of your project. Your talent pool will be far more limited, and you\u2019ll have to offer them something they value in exchange for your time. Is your music interesting? Challenging? Can you offer the potential of income down the road? (And I\u2019m talking concrete potential - do you have management? Gigs lined up? A substantial following? A network of contacts that will be of value to the people who \u2018work for\u2019 you?) If you don\u2019t have any of the above, you need to rethink your premise. Because if you have nothing to trade in exchange for their work, you are NOT going to find musicians to work for you. You might find musicians who will work with you. If you\u2019re willing to not be in charge, go to jam sessions, open mics, songwriter\u2019s clubs. Approach buskers and ask if they\u2019d like to jam sometime. But be realistic. Good musicians have invested a lot of time and effort in developing their skills. In order to get someone to play for free, you need to be the best offer on the table. ",
