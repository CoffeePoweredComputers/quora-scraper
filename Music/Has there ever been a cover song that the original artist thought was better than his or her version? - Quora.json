            "answer_text": "Johnny Cash's cover of Nine Inch Nails' \"Hurt\" is incredible, and far more emotional and accessible than the original. Trent Reznor once said about his first time listening to the cover: \u201cI pop the video in, and wow... Tears welling, silence, goose-bumps... Wow. [I felt like] I just lost my girlfriend, because that song isn't mine anymore... It really made me think about how powerful music is as a medium and art form. I wrote some words and music in my bedroom as a way of staying sane, about a bleak and desperate place I was in, totally isolated and alone. [Somehow] that winds up reinterpreted by a music legend from a radically different era/genre and still retains sincerity and meaning \u2014 different, but every bit as pure.\" (from Wiki) Evidently, he doesn't directly say that the cover is better. But don't we all think it anyway? ",

He had such talent, he could find things inside a song and vigorously develop them. He found things that other people wouldn't think of finding in there. He probably improved upon it by the spaces he was using. I took license with the song from his version, actually, and continue to do it to this day.\" In the booklet accompanying his Biograph album, Dylan said: \"I liked Jimi Hendrix's record of this and ever since he died I've been doing it that way... Strange how when I sing it, I always feel it's a tribute to him in some kind of way.\" ",
