            "answer_text": "Yes and no. There are a few\u2026VERY few rappers who have gotten signed in their late 20\u2019s-early 30\u2019s. I can only think of Jay-Z who independently released his first album at 27, Rick Ross who released his debut album at 30, and 2 Chainz at 34. But keep in mind that Jay-Z was already a well-known rapper in Brooklyn many years before his debut. He was already on a major record with Jaz-O called Hawaiian Sophie when he was 19 years old. 2 Chainz used to go by \u2018Tity Boi\u2019 when he was part of Playaz Circle and they released an album when he was 24\u2026he then got signed to DTP years before he rebranded himself as \u20182 Chainz\u2019. And Rick Ross was already featured on a major compilation album by Eric Sermon when was 24 years old. I say all that to say that people like to point to those 3 successful rappers as proof that you can make it in your late 20\u2019s and early 30\u2019s. However they neglect to recognize the fact that they have already had a certain level of success and acclaim in rap music before their debut when they were much younger. To answer your question, if you are just beginning to rap, then 28 is too old IF you plan on becoming a successful rapper. However, if you\u2019ve already made a name for yourself locally and have been featured on some major projects and are selling out shows, then continue\u2026don\u2019t quit. ",
