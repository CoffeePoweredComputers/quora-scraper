            "answer_text": "Choose a song you think is incredibly powerful,so powerful it moves you to tears. Now look up the lyrics and read them out loud. Nowhere near as impressive, huh? Very few songs can hold up to that test, and even the ones that do don't come close to reviving the same experience you have when you listen to the song. Same with covers. Go on YouTube and listen to a cover of one of your favorite songs. Same lyrics, but the emotion just isn't there. Even if they sang it \u201cbetter.\u201d Better pitch, better range. It doesn't matter, because only the original song makes you feel that profound emotion. The lyrics alone don't make a song powerful, it's the interpretation, it's the story you're telling, it's what you're NOT saying. So if you want powerful song lyrics, tell a powerful story. Tell a story that hurts so bad, you have to leave a few things out. Tell it in a way that either breaks you or heals you. ",
