            "answer_text": "Guessing from your question, you are trying to expand your K-Pop love beyond BTS and I\u2019m glad that you asked the question. Being a multi fandom K-Pop stan i think i can suggest you some and based on your preferences you can decide. Bigbang - They are called the Kings of KPop and they are in all way worthy of the title. But let me tell you they are a second generation group and out of 5 members, 4 are currently serving in the military so if you become a fan don\u2019t blame me for the comeback wait :p. These 5 guys are multi talented, funny af and damn good at producing good music. And they started producing their own music long before producing your own music was a thing. If you like good music with different genres, Bigbang is the group for you. Also all the BTS members are inspired by them and are fanboys themselves! Song recommendations - Bang Bang Bang, Fantastic Baby, Loser, Bae Bae, Haru Haru, Blue BTOB - Vocal powerhouse! BtoB is a vocally talented group where the rappers can sing as good as the vocalists and the vocalists are out of the worls. They mostly sing ballads so if you like that genre , you will love them. These 7 members are some of the funniest people in the world and you would love how natural and relatable these guys are in real life. They love to have fun and enjoy themselves to the fullest on shows. Song recommendations - Missing you, Remember That, It\u2019s Okay, You are the only one for me, Movie, For you IKON - These 7 guys have shaken Korea this year with there BOP Love Scenario. Every child in the country knows this song and they sing it everywhere to the extent that they banned singing the song in the schools. IKON have beautiful songs, powerful choreos, amazing vocals (Jay, June), cool rappers (B.I.,Bobby) and are an amazing group to stan if you would. Song recommendations - Love Scenario, Adore you, Best Friend, Bling Bling, Rhythem Ta, My Type Winner - Winner is a group which constantly experiments with their music and really put out some good quality music. If you like listening to multi genre music, they might suit your music test. Song recommendations - Really Really, Empty, Island, Everywhere, Air, Movie Star For Girl groups - I think you should definitely check out MAMAMOO (amazing vocals), Blackpink (Girl Crush), Twice (Cute) etc. Well looks like i have written quite a lot already but I wanted to give you some base to start so i wrote a little bit about each of them. There are still so many groups out there which are extremely talented and hard working whom you can stan. (Super Junior, Exo, GOT7,Shinee etc) Enjoy! ",

            "answer_text": "hi there here are some groups i recomend Seventeen My ult group. I litterally love them SO much, they have got the rap, they got the vocals, and they got the visuals ;) and they kind of have a flirty-romantic concept, but they recently got into a dark concept. I recomend \u2018\u2019fear\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019getting closer\u2019\u2019 2. 1team  Ok, they are the definition of underrated. They litterally have so much talent, and they work so hard :( They are one of the groups i have recently started stanning, and it only took me about 3 minutes to stan them, because i just started liking them so fast. I recomend \u2018\u2019vibe\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019make this\u2019\u2019 even though they are totally two different concepts. 3. Everglow  They are so aesthetically pleasing, and they kind of give me a Red Velvet aura. Mostly because they don\u2019t really do the aegyo concept, they kind of have more of a mature concept, even though they are still pretty young. Songs i recomend are \u2018\u2019bon bon chocolat\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019adios\u2019\u2019. 4. NCT  Even though this is not an ot21 picture, i definatally don\u2019t regret stanning them. I was so frikin proud and happy when i memorized all of them, it took my like 2 weeks. Even though they aren\u2019t a super old group, they are definately the most popular one in my opinion. Songs i recomand are \u2018\u2019black on black\u2019\u2019 by NCT 2018 and \u2018\u2019without you\u2019\u2019 by NCT U. 5. EXO  Ok, it was EXO and BlackPink that got me into kpop. EXO just really appealed to me because of their concept, and i honestly really liked it. And i still do. I got to give them extra points for their awsome hard work, and their fans that constantly support EXO. I totally recomend stanning them. 6. Shinee  Whenever i am in a bad place, i listen to Shinee. Their songs always help me get through things, and i love it. And they kind of break the standards, they don\u2019t really go on the \u2018\u2019typical\u2019\u2019 Kpop concept. Songs i recomend are \u2018\u2019An Encore\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019Dream Girl\u2019\u2019. 7. Twice  They are my favorite girl group for a reason. They have won alot, and they deserve it. But they do get some hate for their aegyo-ish concept, but it is not nessecary to hate on a certain groups concept. They are also super pretty. Songs i recomend are \u2018\u2019TT\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019yes or yes\u2019\u2019 ",

            "answer_text": "There are numerous groups out there for you to stan, but I\u2019ll give you some groups that have a similar\u2026 \u201cvibe\u201d to that of BTS. BAP - I know there\u2019s something going on with their contract and their leader, but BAP was the first third generation group with such strong rappers (Yongguk - leader, Zelo - maknae)song recommendations: {Wake Me Up, Honeymoon, Feel So Good}Block B - this group is the home of ZICO, a huge rapper in the Kpop/Khip-hop industrysong recommendations: {Toy, Her, Shall We Dance}Stray Kids - these guys are the least problematic group you could ever stan. All of them are so sweet and young as well - most of them are in their late teens to early twenties. They\u2019re an educated group of guys that self-produce a majority of their songs, what more do you need? :)song recommendations: {Hellevator, My Pace, District 9}NCT (particularly NCT 127) - I absolutely love NCT and stan all the subunits, but the subunit most similar to BTS\u2019s music would be NCT 127 due to their amazing main rappers: Taeyong and Marksong recommendations: {Cherry Bomb, Regular, Boss (NCT U)}EXO - EXO\u2019s music is so so diverse that I\u2019m absolutely sure you\u2019ll find a few songs you like. A lot of BTS fans end up staining EXO as well, despite the petty fanwars and stuff. Disregard immature fans and just listen to their music and you\u2019ll fall in love with them :)song recommendations: {Overdose, Monster, Tempo (their most recent release!)}Big Bang - Kings only in this household! But really, Big Bang is legendary in the Kpop world, and anyone would agree with me on this. G-Dragon is a name that won\u2019t ever be forgotten, along with T.O.P, Daesung, Seungri, and Taeyangsong recommendations: {Bang Bang Bang, Loser, Let\u2019s Not Fall In Love}Hope this helped! These are artists that truly work hard to make music that their fans will enjoy and they enjoy performing to, and there truly is a whole world of music out there. Hopefully you can find something you like :) ",

            "answer_text": "There are a couple of groups to stan but I will list the ones first which you should not: Blackpink: Yes their songs are superb. And they are very talented too but: 1. They lack stage presence. You won't like them performing live. 2. Jennie is lazy at dancing. She looks bored while performing on stage. 3. Lisa and Jennie both are annoying. 4. YG(CEO of Blackpink) gives stress to Ros\u00e9's for her voice. 5. Unfortunately, they only have 10 songs. But there are reasons you can stan them: 1. Lisa is actually an outstanding dancer and rapper. 2. Jisoo is the one people are most comfortable with. 3. Ros\u00e9 actually has a very beautiful voice but if YG doesn't give her stress then it will be good. 4. Jennie's both rapping and singing skills are awesome.Momoland: People say they are problematic. And being an Indian you might find their song Bboom Bboom very boring. And there are a lot of controversies associated with them. But you can stan them because they have some nice songs like Baam and I'm so hot. And Nancy and Yeonwoo are very beautiful and other members too have awesome vocals and visuals.Now the boy groups you should Stan: 1. BTS: No words for them. Totally speechless for them. They have bring a revolution to the modern era. Their songs have theories. Generally their old songs like Boy in Luv, No more dream, We are Bulletproof will appeal to Indians. Their songs also help to free mind from depression. Their focus is on youth problems mostly. 2. Stray Kids: This group is also outstanding. The members are very cool. Their songs also make a change. Their best song according to me is Hellevator because the lyrics are actually very motivational. 3. NCT: There are subunits in this group. They are: NCT 127, NCT U, NCT Dream and WayV(NCT China). I would recommend NCT 127 and NCT U because you might find NCT Dream's songs (like Chewing Gum) childish. Go and listen NCT 127\u2019s Fire Truck, Cherry Bomb, Chain, Simon Says and NCT U's Boss and The 7th sense. The group also has fantastic visuals like Taeyong, Mark and others. 4. EXO: They are an SM group. They have won 300 awards (I guess more). They are one of the top 3 groups in South Korea and worldwide also they are known very well. They have awesome vocals like Chen, Baekhyun and D.O, amazing dancers like Kai and Sehun and awsome visuals like Chanyeol and Suho(leader). Suho also with some other group members came to India for promoting K-pop. Chanyeol is a Happy Virus. The Chinese members are also superb but they are no more in EXO. One of the Chinese members, Lay was in the Indian film Kung Fu Yoga. D.O has even sung songs in Spanish. 5. Super Junior: They are the seniors of Exo. They are a group since 2005. Their songs are awesome like Bonamana, Mr. Simple, Sorry Sorry. They are one of the legendary groups. The members are very good-looking and funny. They are great!Now girl groups:1. 2ne1: I am recommending this group first because their songs are actually awesome. They are verrryy talented. Go and listen their songs: I am the best, Can't nobody, Come Back Home, etc. They are also beautiful. Don't listen to people who call them ugly. Their leader CL is one of the best female rapper. She has an awesome voice both in vocal and rap. Minzy is a dancing queen. Her voice is super cool. Bom has the most beautiful voice which sounds like pearls. Dara is a stunning visual. She is also a good rapper and vocal. One of the best CL's song is The baddest female. Minzy's Ninano and Bom's You and I are superb. They are Blackpink's seniors. Unfortunately, they are disbanded. 2. SNSD(also known as Girls' Generation): They are known as the queens of K-pop. They have awesome visuals like Yoona, Tiffany and Sooyoung(she looks like an Indian Actress). Their songs like I got a Boy, The Boys and Gee are awesome. They are also actresses.

Miss A- They are the seniors of Twice. They have awesome songs. Min has a graceful voice and is a dancing goddess. Fei and Jia are Chinese members and are awesome at vocals. Jia is a great rapper.

            "answer_text": "ahhh this might be rlly long so pls sit tight kiddos I, myself, started out as a BTS stan as well and was rlly hesitant to branch out from that specific group since I was worried I wouldn\u2019t enjoy their music that much. But, alas, I cracked out of my shell eventually and discovered a lot of groups, so here they are: Girl Groups to Stan . . Red Velvet  This is definitely one of my favorite girl K-pop groups and that\u2019s saying a lot cus I stan a lot of groups. Some of my favorite songs by them are \u2018Bad Boy\u2019 and \u2018Psycho\u2019. Dreamcatcher  This is another group that I really enjoy. Some of my favorite songs by them are \u2018Chase Me\u2019 and \u2018Deja Vu\u2019, so I definitely recommend listening to those. Twice  Also one of my favorite groups. I think they seem kind of \u2018intimidating\u2019, I guess, because there are so many members. Some of my favorite songs are \u2018Feel Special\u2019 and \u2018Yes or Yes\u2019. Boy Groups to Stan . . Seventeen  I absolutely love their music! They were probably what I would call the second group that I began to listen to after BTS. Some of my favorite songs by them are \u2018Don\u2019t Wanna Cry\u2019 and \u2018Come to Me\u2019. Got7  I\u2019m not going to lie, I was pretty hesitant to listen to their music when it was recommended to me, but I\u2019m not gonna lie, I was completely wrong lmao. \u2018Never Ever\u2019 and \u2018Just Right\u2019 are some of my favorite songs. NCT 127  This is another ultimate group for me personally. I love all of their personalities. My favorite song has to be \u2018Regular\u2019 lmao . . Thanks for reading! Lots of hugs~ -lia ",

            "answer_text": "MamamooThey are very talented and have different concepts compared to most other girl groups. They are also very open with their beliefs and aren't afraid to shut down nonsense. During the MMAs, their performance was cut down to 7 minutes, and they were forced to perform along with the rookie groups. They sang near the end of the performance \u201ccut cut cut, that's what they did\u201d. A member of the group, Hwasa, was continually pestered for not wearing a bra at the airport. People belittled her online and news sites asked her many questions about her harmless outfit. Mamamoo handled it very well and kept their cool. Moonbyul is the rapper of the group, and though she can't rap fast, she has great flow. I would say she is one of the best female kpop rappers. She released her solo abum, Eclipse, recently. It has a powerful title track and catchy side tracks. Something else about this member, she wears what she wants. When asked about why she doesn't show much skin, she answers, \u201cI feel like I don't need to show off skin to be sexy.\u201d I don't exactly know how to describe the member's voices, but I will say that their songs are great. I tend to go for either pwerful concepts or relaxing more RnB type songs. Their albums have both. Their newest album, reality in BLACK, has a variety of different songs, so you're bound to like at least one. Also, they\u2019re very goofy and not afraid to show their humor, no matter how dirty it may be. All I have to say is that they aren't called Vocal Queens for no reason. I will recommend some songs from their new album. Calm SongsTen NightsHello MamaZzZzPowerful SongsHip4x4everDestinyMy favorite from the new albumBetterMy favorite in generalRude BoyHwasa's outfit at the airport Moonbyul  (Left to right) Moonbyul, Solar, Wheein, HwasaStray KidsI honestly don't know how I got so into their music. All I remember is watching crack videos of them, and now I listen to their music daily. To be honest, I wasn't really a fan of Hellevator (though I loved it's meaning) but I've been finding their newer releases more enjoyable for me. Their songs are mostly about injustices and issue with society and their personal experiences growing up. My favorite title track of theirs is Side Effects. It's very unique and I would kill to see it live. The group's rappers are very skilled as well. We have seen on multiple occasions (like on Idol Room) how good Changbin and Han are at freestyle. Though we don't see as much of Bangchan's rapping, a simple search on YouTube will send you to great examples of his talent. Their vocal line is not exactly the best, but they are doing their best and improving every comeback. The group in all is very passionate about their music. Seungmin, for example, listens to their own songs often to see what they can fix and work on for their next comeback. The members have described him as very critical and serious of their work. They are also extremely funny. My favorite video is the family roleplay they did (search: Stray Kids family roleplay). I almost peed myself laughing lol I will recommend songs (not only from their newest album). Calm SongsI am YouSunshine19Hype/EDM SongsSide EffectsMirohN/SMy favorite from the new albumSunshineMy favorite in generalM.I.A3racha, the subunit of rappers(from top to bottom) Changbin, Bangchan, Han  (from left to right) Changbin, Hyunjin, Lee Know, Felix, I.N, Han, Woojin\u2014former member-- ,Seungmin, BangchanDay6They are not the traditional Korean group. They are an actual band. Dowoon plays the drum, Jae, Sungjin and YounK play the guitar, and Wonpil plays the keyboard. Like all other JYP artists, they are always on crack. Sadly, they don't get to perform on big award shows and get the recognition they deserve. I wouldn't say they're underrated since their fanbase is pretty big, but they definitely deserve better recognition and award show opportunities. You would think a JYP group would at least get that -_-. For their voices, they're very unique. It is fairly easy to tell who is singing. Wonpil has a more high pitched light voice, Sunjin has a rough voice, Jae sings with a slight rasp, and YoungK/Brian has a smooth voice. There are not many times where Dowoon sings, but when he does, everyone uwus. Their songs are also really good even if you don't like rock. With their newest album, The book of us: Entropy, they made a couple songs that weren\u2019t as instrumental. You may be wondering why the band is called Day6 when they only have 5 members. They did have another member earlier on who was caught up in a scandal. He ultimately terminated his contract and left in 2015.

            "answer_text": "I have several, but I\u2019ll narrow it down to the top 6 (3 per gender) and why. Boy Groups BigBang  Now, there\u2019s something I need to get out of the way before I go on, there\u2019s now only 4 members because the member in the middle (Seungri) left for some legal reasons a few months back, but I won\u2019t get into that here. Basically BigBang is a group that really has it all, and they make it known quite often through their work. Whether it be R&B, pop, rap, etc\u2026chances are you can find a BigBang song in that genre, and it\u2019s probably really good too (for example, I HATE jazz, but their song Cafe was amazing and is arguably my favorite by them). And as an added bonus, every member has a prolific solo career as well so there\u2019s 5 times the content. Recommended Song:  EXO  Now, why should you listen to EXO? There is a multitude of reasons, but the biggest one is they\u2019re the successor to Super Junior, and basically just updated the sound. So, though I wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re as good of a vocal group as SUJU, they\u2019re pretty close AND they know how to make a damn fine song. With much more of a pop or soul vibe, another great band with some amazing solo and subunit work, always worth a listen. Recommended Song:  Day6  Now, this is a band, not a traditional idol group (though they are idols) and it\u2019s a welcome refresher from the general industry every once in a while. Being what I would call the \u201cKings of Quality\u201d, I would argue these boys have never once made a bad song, ever. They do a lot of experimentation with their music so there\u2019s always a song out there for you if you want a break from the traditional sounds or simply want to try something new. Recommended Song:  Other Recommended Boy Groups: BtoB, iKon, Super Junior, TVXQ!, Infinite, VIXX, Ateez, Seventeen, and The Rose (as well as many others). Girl Groups Girls Generation  One of the older groups in the industry by this point, Girls Generation is still a vocal powerhouse and always worth a listen. They have a pretty consistent style, but it\u2019s a nice and peppy one, and they're rather good at it, so I have no complaints here. Recommended Song:  Mamamoo  Mamamoo is a rather unique group and one I couldn\u2019t recommend highly enough. Though a rather small group, they have it all. You want singing? They got it. Rap? They got it. Oppressively hot girls? Picture as my proof, they got it. They also will vary their style rather frequently and have a rather small, but quite good, solo work portfolio going. Recommended Song:  Twice  I\u2019m gonna be honest, I don\u2019t know a WHOLE lot about Twice (I mainly listen to Boy Groups) and I was gonna put Red Velvet in instead, but then I remembered the song I put below and that they\u2019re super hot. So like, listen to it! But also listen to Psycho by Red Velvet, that song is fire. Recommended Song:  Other Recommended Groups: Red Velvet, CLC, f(x), and GFriend Soloists This is a separate category that I just came up with in case you wanted to get into more Korean music in general. This will really just be a list of soloists that I like that you should totally listen to. John Park, K.Will, Ailee, Sik-K, Jay Park, Simon Dominic, Flowsik, IU, Bewhy, C-Jamm, Jessi, and Changmo. ",

            "answer_text": "I know I\u2019m super late, but for a BTS fan, I\u2019d definitely recommend A.C.E! A.C.E is a 5-member boy group from Beat Interactive, which is a very small company which was originally run from a basement practice room (although, it\u2019s speculated that they moved to a better practice area, which is great!). A.C.E debuted in May 2017 and has been very active since! They currently have 2 single albums, a special song, and 1 repackaged album out, but all 5 members were active in the survival programs The Uni+ and MixNine towards the end of 2017 and early 2018.  A.C.E\u2019s music style has changed quite frequently, and they\u2019re still experimenting with their sound. Their debut song, Cactus, and their first comeback single Callin\u2019 both feature similar EDM-hardstyle sounds, which is a little overwhelming at first, but they easily become addictive songs that are great to dance to! Their most recent comeback with Take Me Higher is a \u201csummery\u201d song which doesn\u2019t have the hardstyle sound. It has a more \u201cmainstream\u201d pop song style, but it is still very addictive! The two new songs that were released with Take Me Higher, titled Black & Blue and Dessert, are polar opposites in terms of sound. Black & Blue is a darker, sexier style and Dessert is a happier, upbeat style. And while I\u2019m at it, I\u2019ll tell you about 5tar. 5tar is A.C.E\u2019s special song I mentioned earlier, and it has 2 versions. The song itself is a powerful ballad and the lyrics were written by the members for the fans and it holds a special meaning. The first version released was the Incompletion version, which features only 4 out of the 5 members. This is because Chan, the maknae, was busy with other group promotions and couldn\u2019t be there upon release of the song. However, the second version is the Completion version, which features Chan. The Completion version isn\u2019t available on iTunes, Spotify, or any platforms other than YouTube, but it\u2019s been rumored to be added on the next album! While it wasn\u2019t released on their official channel, A.C.E was featured in a song by French DJ Hcue, in the song I Feel So Lucky. The song is in all English and it\u2019s honestly a very sexy, club-esque song.  (I\u2019d like to give a warning before you watch this video, there are a lot of flashing lights!) Since I\u2019m already so far into this, I\u2019ll tell you a little about the members! So, the members of the groups are Park Junhee (leader, lead vocal, lead dancer), Lee Donghun (main vocal), Kim Sehyoon/Wow (main rapper, main dancer, vocalist, visual), Kim Byeongkwan (main dancer, lead vocal, rapper), and Kang Yuchan (main vocal, maknae). Junhee and Chan were on The Uni+ (Junhee placed 21st & Chan placed 9th) while Donghun, Sehyoon, and Byeongkwan were on Mixnine (Donghun placed 8th, Sehyoon placed 11th, and Byeongkwan placed 3rd). Because Chan placed 9th, he became a member of the boy group UNB, which is the reason why he couldn\u2019t participate in Take Me Higher promotions or in the initial release of 5tar. Byeongkwan and Donghun were supposed to debut in the Mixnine Top9 group, but a contract agreement couldn\u2019t be made between YG and the winners\u2019 companies.  Before debut, A.C.E was fairly active. Junhee and Donghun were on season 4 of I Can See Your Voice. Donghun & his partner were winners and got to sing/dance with GOT7, Junhee was eliminated but got to perform for some members of H.O.T and he even got to sing a small part with Kangta. The group was also very popular for busking and cover videos that they posted to their channel. They\u2019ve covered BTS, Seventeen, H.O.T, NCT U, and many other groups. For a BTS fan, I\u2019d recommend watching their covers of Blood, Sweat, & Tears, Fire, and Not Today (the boys have actively talked about liking BTS and wanting to collaborate at some point, so I would also like to point out that these boys do partially consider BTS as role models to them)! The boys were also active with 1Million Dance Studio and participated in some of their choreography videos and they even performed at their Up All Night concert.  These boys are incredibly talented, they\u2019re super sweet, and they\u2019re definitely not a group to miss out on. They\u2019re always aiming to show Choice, their fandom, the best they have to offer and they\u2019re constantly showing us love and support since we do the same for them! I hope you (and anyone reading this) can give A.C.E a chance, it\u2019d be greatly appreciated! Thank you! ",

NCT: they debuted in 2016 and are under SM entertainment their leader is Taeyong their age line is between 1994\u20132002. Also they are already slaying the billboard and other charts! they are very active and has 21 members and are divided in 4 units at the moment which is nct dream ( the youngest who are under 20 KA) nct u ( very diverse and members are different every time) nct 127 ( 10 members, doesn't change. Like any kpop sub unit) and lastly Wayv ( which consist nct's chinese members). You might find them very hard to understand at first but keep watching their videos, and make sure to watch lee soo man's introduction to nct back at 2015 or 2016. Also watch crack videos! They are funny and has a bright personality! Not to mention that nct 127 topped in billboard's emerging artist at #1! ATEEZ: debuted 2018, they are rookie boys but better keep up with them now. They topped the billboards album chart at #5, with just a second comeback! They are getting more recgonition even though they come from a small company which is KQ entertainment. They consist of 8 members and their leader is hong joong ! Their age line is between 1998\u20132000 line. They are all pretty much adults. here are some for now,, i'll suggest some for you later on since i'm very busy hehe. ",

Their variety shows make me laugh to the point of tears, the fandom (Monbebe) is chill, and the members are super kind and thoughtful to the fans (Wonho wears a necklace that says \u201cMonbebe\u201d). My recommended songs: \u201cAlligator\u201d, \u201cAll In\u201d, \u201cShootout\u201d, \u201cOh My!\u201d, \u201cStuck\u201d. If you like slow ballad songs, they make those too. And check out their self-cam mvs! The members are:  Shownu -the stoic and somewhat awkward leader and choreographer.  Wonho - the eye-candy who is obsessed with his own fans. He even proposed\u2026  Minhyuk (my bias) - the extroverted chatterbox with no limits on personal space.  Kihyun - the fiery little lead vocalist  Hyungwon - the model and meme-king  Jooheon - the best rapper in all of kpop, and you can fight me if you disagree (jk Monbebes don\u2019t fight)  IM - the \u201cgrandpa\u201d maknae and most popular member ",

I would say that it\u2019s really a feat that B.I is able to write ikon\u2019s songs without prior dating experience. The dude writes songs based off emotions he gets when watching a movie like??? That\u2019s amazing. I also genuinely like everything they put out within three listens which is really a big thing for me. Also, I\u2019m only scrolling down and reading the other replies and I\u2019m actually shocked someone else wrote about ikon? I\u2019m really happy about that. Now Pentagon is definitely that one group that I matured with. When they debuted with Gorilla I was very into stronger title tracks so it appealed to me. As I progressed with life they came out with Like This which was a very inspiring song for me as I heard it without reading the lyrics. So far, their title tracks have appealed to me and my mental state at the time so i always found it very cool. Plus, their new song Shine is a bright song that has growth in it and I\u2019m in a period where I HAVE to accept that I\u2019m growing up so it\u2019s helping me accept it in a way. Their side tracks take longer for me to fully enjoy but they have hits like Lukewarm, Violet and Pretty Boys which really made me go wOW the first time I heard them. ",

They have been in the industry before BTS and are from a well established company of the K-pop industry. Now why stan them? They share a really good bond with each other in terms of artists of the same industry and as friends too. Over the years their friendship has resulted in A.R.M.Y and EXO-L also bonding and creating a respectful space. BTS are themselves EXO-L and are often caught singing and dancing along to their songs in award shows. They are very typical Korean beauties and often sing boyfriend material songs.(if u are a teenager then that\u2019s probably something u would enjoy). If u enjoy rap then maybe u might not wanna stan EXO cause I feel that BTS has better rap line. EXO is basically Korea's national boy scout and represent what korean fans expect or like in their idols. I personally don\u2019t stan EXO cause I like the diversity that BTS brings but then again u might wanna check them out . It\u2019s my first answer and I don\u2019t know much about EXO so pls let me know if u feel there are any mistakes. ",

They have written and produced their own songs right from pre-debut and make BOPS, they write about topics that matter to them and have social commentary (in fact they stated they don't write love songs coz its not what they relate to at the moment and they want to be honest basically), and are all very talented. Highkey my favourite rap line after bts in all of kpop. Also the boys are ADORABLE. You cant help but love them. And their friendship is really special. All 9 of them love each other a lot and its wonderful to watch. Basically, while they're both individual artists and shouldn't be compared, i cant deny that theyre the only group out of all the ones i stanned that gave me similar vibes to when i started stanning bts. I still prefer bts personally, but stray kids rose up my bias list and displaced all the other groups i liked to become part of my top 3 groups (BTS, and then day6 and skz). So do try and give them a chance! I suggest starting by watching their predebut survival show :D ",

            "answer_text": "There are a lot of great groups to stan. But for me it will be EXO, BTS and SEVENTEEN. EXO is of course one of the most popular kpop groups. The members have strong vocals. And all round talented. And their concept is based on supernatural powers. Their concept is really hard to understand if you dont watch from the start. Their songs are literally connected to each other. It is like a whole story. The group has made a lot of history. And is continuing to do so. BTS too is one of the most popular group. The vocal and rap line is really strong. All the members are talented. Their songs are really inspiring especially for the youth. The concept of their songs are great too. And lastly SEVENTEEN, when it comes to talking about the most multi talented group I would personally choose SEVENTEEN. They have the power/potential to make their songs and cheoreograp their dance all by their own. Most of the songs are dedicated to their fans. It is really adorable. And if you like great performances I would recommend you to watch SEVENTEEN. They always have the best performances. ",

            "answer_text": "I think there are many answers to your question. it mainly depends on the type of music and group you like. Now knowing BTS as an ARMY myself, the biggest thing besides the music and the actual group itself would be the theories. another group would be stray kids. I know that other people have mentioned stray kids but not really the theory aspect. I think that the theories really give their group something to be interested in. If you are interested in finding groups with a clean and cut edge choreographies then I would suggest seventeen. Seventeen is known for their harmony on stage and their really synced dance moves. Example:   They are somewhat dance kings, and many of their songs involve intense choreography just like \u2018hit\u2019   IF you are looking for more vocal groups then you can find BTOB to satisfy your needs for vocals. Seriously, they are amazing. Unfortunately i cant show you their singing prowess through pics or gifs but songs such as Beautiful pain and Missing you are ones that showcase their vocals well. Either way, whichever group you get to know, I hope you become stans of them all! have fun! ",

I recommend whistle and playing with fire to listen to first but I think you\u2019ll like all their songs,most ARMYS do Members left to right: ros\u00e9,lisa,jennie,jisoo  Ok now EXO. A lot of immature EXO-L and ARMY create conflict with each other. Both fandoms have huge fan wars with each other due to their huge success. However, EXO have really good music and try different genres. Their harmonisation make their songs much better and catchy. I recommend monster and love me right to listen to first Members top left to right: Baekhyun,Chanyeol,Chen,DO,Kai,Lay,Sehun,Suho,Xuimin  ",

All of them except maybe for Chanwoo are excellent dancers. B.I is a very good leader and him and Bobby are excellent rappers. They even participated in Show Me The Money 3 with Winner\u2019s Minho; but were eliminated except for Bobby who won and bought a house for his parents in South Korea with the money. To me, all the members can be classified as visuals.  Their vocals are amazing and unique so you can clearly differentiate their voices. All of their songs are Self composed (mostly B.I and Bobby). They went through 2 survival/competition programs before being able to debut and are very close to each other. I could go on but I think I\u2019ve made my point\u2026 ",

They just have this charm that got me into loving them and I think you\u2019d probably get sucked into too. A few of their songs I like because I recently just started stanning them and I\u2019m already whipped. Ahem, they are Don\u2019t Wanna Cry, Fear, Let me hear you say, Home and Good To Me.

All 5 members have amazing personalities so you never get bored.

Also the members are pretty old if you are teenager like me but that doesn\u2019t make them less \u201cstanable\u201d in my eyes. 4 of the 5 members are in military right now so there will not be any actions by their side until 2020, at least not big ones like a tour or something but the wait will definitely be worth it. I hope you will give them a chance because I know BTS seems appealing, because I am also an ARMY but BigBang will forever have their special place in my heart. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a bunch of good girl and boy groups apart from BTS. EXOThe coolest and the most visual packed group. Great rappers and singers! Everybody is a visual here. They have received an award for the nation's pick! Their song power has also been played at Dubai fountain ! They have really good songs with great choreography. Great beats for sure.   It's nine of them - xuimin, suho (leader), lay, baekhyun, Chen, chanyeol, D.o, kai, and maknae sehun. BLACKPINKFOR SURE THE BEST GIRLFROUP OUT THERE. I can't even talk about them, how good they are. From singing to visuals to rapping to dancing everything is amazing. Fashion is fire.     NCTI know it's a really big group but it has some really good songs. Since the members are young, the energy is great.  WayV which is a new extension to the nct club is the most coolest, in my opinion.  ",

            "answer_text": "I recommend Stray Kids - they have a trio unit 3racha that writes all of their songs. SKZ songs also have motivational, deep meaning that I love; some of my favorite songs are Hellevator (their pre-debut song), Grow up (ballad with a positive message), Neverending Story (OST for a recent K-drama, such a beautiful song), Voices, and many more. TXT (Tomorrow by Together) is another group that I love. Their debut song Crown was a total bop that I enjoyed, and the new album released last October had amazing songs as well. Blue Orangeade was my favorite song from their debut album. Run Away was a great title track for their second album. TXT also has amazing ballads, such as 20cm and Nap of a Star. ",

Her delivery, flow, breath control all are on point and first time when I listened to her raps she kind of reminded me of SUGA. Check out her raps from unpretty rapstar and dollar$$$ from their album. I mean if I were to choose between Lisa or soyeon then I'll absolutely go for soyeon. You might think \u2018what rubbish\u2019 but u have to check her out to understand my point and then you'll know. And the second I'd recommend is mamamoo, not a Stan of them but love their vocals, their stage presence and killer performances. You'll surely be smitten by solar and hwasa tho, solar is very good at poll dancing even of she's just learnt it this year and hwasa\u2026.. God, you should watch her MAMA 2018 performance. Our of all kpop girl groups, no one can pull off performances like them, no one. ",

Although they sadly  disbanded in 2013, they have songs that make me think I'm in music heaven. Yes, the dance is spectacular. Honestly, SPEED would have been such an amazing group to Stan if they were still together, they honestly rival BTS in terms of my Kpop love. My fave song of SPEED would have to be Don't Tease Me (Dance and song just theeee BEST) check it out here: SO GOOD  Also plz look at other songs as well, cuz SPEED is such an amazing group.

More like a window to their soul. Not forgetting, they are so funny and they always seem to love and enjoy what they are doing. Also, at the end of most MV, they ditch their dance routine and just have fun, which I love. Most importantly, they don't lipsync during live. Please watch this MV.  ",

If you are trying to stan as like a new kpopper, I would suggest newer groups because they have less info and is easier to follow, also keeping in mind to try not to choose groups that have like more than 10 members cuz that gets messed up in the brain. If you already stan kpop groups, then its easier because you kind of get the hang of memorizing name-faces and voices-personalities, ya know what im saying? Anyway, the ones listed are my personal FAVORITES and I\u2019m also looking to stan more groups :) Hope this helps! `RX ",
