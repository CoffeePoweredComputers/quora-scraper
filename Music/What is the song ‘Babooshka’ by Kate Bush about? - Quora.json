            "answer_text": "A woman wants to know if her husband would be unfaithful, so she writes to him using the pseudonym Babooshka. The husband is intrigued because Babooshka seems like his wife used to be when they first met. He writes back. The wife then decides to see if he\u2019ll agree to meet her, which he does. She goes dressed as Babooshka. When they meet he falls for her, as she really reminds him of his wife when she was younger. Then she takes off the disguise and starts throwing things at him, which is where we leave them. It\u2019s about trust and jealousy and the issues of complacency. The woman wants to know if he would have an affair, not if he is having one. The man likes Babooshka because she reminds him of how his wife used to be, and is prepared to have an affair. It deals with the differences between men and women in relationships and like much Kate Bush, despite the ominous feeling, isn\u2019t entirely serious. ",

            "answer_text": "From Wikipedia: According to an interview Kate Bush gave to the Australian TV series Countdown in 1980, the song chronicles a wife's desire to test her husband's loyalty. To do so, she takes on the nom de plume of Babooshka and sends notes to her husband in the guise of a younger woman\u2014something which she fears is the opposite of how her husband currently sees her. (Hence the barbed lines Just like his wife before she \"freezed\" on him/Just like his wife when she was beautiful.) The trap is set when, in her bitterness and paranoia, Babooshka arranges to meet her husband, who is attracted to the character who reminds him of his wife in earlier times. She thereby ruins the relationship due to her paranoia. \"I'm sure I heard about it on some TV series years ago, when I was a kid,\" Bush remarked of the song's story. \"You know, these period things that the BBC do. I think it's an extraordinary thing for someone to do\u2026 That's why I found it fascinating.\u201d The song ends with a sample of glass breaking, one of the earliest examples of a sample created with the newly-available Fairlight CMI digital synthesizer.  In an interview (I don\u2019t remember which one), Kate says the glass breaking is meant to be dishes being thrown at the \u201cnaughty husband.\u201d I\u2019m not sure about the reference to Countdown. It cannot be correct that this it was the Australian show of that name, as her appearance there was in 1978, not 1980 (with Leif Garrett also present, I remember). It would be at least another year before Babooshka was released. There was also a Dutch program called Countdown, and the Wikipedia writer may have confused this with the other program. ",
