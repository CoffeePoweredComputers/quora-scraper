            "answer_text": "There might not actually be a \"better\" these days, but there are some trends. There was a period when PC computers were very complicated and unstable. When they became more and more stable, PCs started to replace Macs as the standard commercial video editing platform. Now Macs have become very uncommon in large video operations. This doesn't mean PCs are better for you, but it does mean they are better for large commercial operations. Remember that the interface on a Mac is really polished, but that doesn't matter for a video editing system. Nobody cares if it looks cool. They are supposed to be working. Many suppliers are making specific video builds on PC for television networks, with all the specific hardware installed and tested. The costs on PC systems are a bit lower per unit of computing power.  All this being the case, you can make a magnificent editing workstation with a Mac, and the hardware is super nice. Adobe Premiere works on Mac pretty well, and if you are using Final Cut, you never had a choice in the first place.  I'd say, if you were planning on only one or two machines, and were doing single, isolated projects, especially short projects, a twelve core mac would be a great, low maintenance system. Wouldn't have to be a trash can either. A late tower would also be really fine. These are often used in smaller companies. Especially ones that do still work like Photoshop stuff on the same systems.  If you just want to cut together some stuff here and there, even a quad core MacBook would do nicely. The quality of the display doesn't matter because you wouldn't use the laptop display to edit video. It's just a cool spare panel for scopes and things. The problem with PC computers and smaller operators is that you can buy whatever parts you want, so people often skimp on their builds in an effort to maximize processor bang per buck. This way you wind up with incredible power for cheap... and then things keep blowing up and not working right, costing you time in the end and making you look bad. Nothing wrong with a PC if you have the discipline to get it right. ",

            "answer_text": "Both Mac and Windows have entry level and mid weight solutions now for video editing.  iMovie on the Mac is a wonderful tool but it has limitations and Windows Movie Maker is a free entry level package for PC, again it has its limitations.  Premiere Elements is a step up from those two and is very affordable.  It runs on either PC or Mac as does its big brother Premiere Pro which starts to become a very highly featured tool.  Also on PC is Sony Vegas, which provides a lot of professional features.  On the Mac Final Cut Pro has many fans and add on products that give it real power.  FInally at the top of the tree there is the Hollywood favourite which is AVID.  It doesn't mean that it is the best choice for every eventuality, just that it is the most fully featured and preferred of professionals.  It also has an enormous price tag on it.  In the end the question is really about what kind of video editing you want to do.  If all you want to do is cut a few clips together then a free or low cost solution on either platform will be fine.  If you want to sync audio and video together then again, both platforms have some great options.  If you want to become a professional video editor on the next Star Wars then maybe you should get a very expensive PC and shell out for AVID. ",
