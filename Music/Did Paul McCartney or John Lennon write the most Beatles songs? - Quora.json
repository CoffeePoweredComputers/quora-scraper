            "answer_text": "Aside from their co-written songs, John wrote a few more songs than Paul. Paul wrote their first single that got them their 1st taste of success, and Paul also wrote the majority of their hit singles. Paul also wrote a dozen or so songs for other artists that were successful. Paul is in the Guinness book of records as the most popular songwriter of all time  After the Breakup of the Beatles, Paul wrote more hits and songs than Lennon until Lennon was no longer with us. Both were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the 90\u2019s followed by George and Ringo. McCartney is credited as the writer on 32 number one hits in the US to Lennons 26 (with 23 co-written), whereas Lennon authored 29 UK number ones to McCartney's 28 (25 co-written). Most No.1 albums on US chart - group The Beatles \u2013 John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr \u2013 have more No.1 albums in the US (19) and UK (15) than anyone else. The band\u2019s US tally includes nine consecutive No.1s from 1965\u201368 and chart-topping debuts for all three Anthology collections in 1995\u201396. The Fab Four managed seven consecutive No.1 albums in their homeland (1963\u201366). Their chart debut, Please Please Me (1963), remains the album to beat for most consecutive weeks at No.1 on UK albums chart (group, one album) \u2013 30 weeks from 11 May to 30 November 1963. In both countries, The Beatles have the most cumulative weeks at No.1 (group, multiple albums) \u2013 132 weeks in the USA and 174 weeks in the UK. Most UK chart singles by a songwriter McCartney has written or co-written 192 songs that have charted on the UK's Official Singles Chart since its launch in 1952. This total includes 32 hits with The Beatles, 21 with Wings and 36 as a soloist or as part of a duo or group. McCartney's 192nd and most recent chart entry was 'All Day', a collaboration with American rapper Kanye West that peaked at No.18 in 2015. And Paul is not through yet! He just had a #1 solo album in the top 200 albums in September 2018! ",

Because most of the Beatles\u2019 songs are credited to both John and Paul, it\u2019s hard to know who wrote what, but if you take into consideration the lead singer of each song, you almost know who wrote it. So, with that in mind, I\u2019m going to try to narrow it down to who wrote the most. John Lennon sings lead on 73 [original] songs, which means he is, most likely, the sole songwriter.* Paul McCartney sings lead on 67 [original] songs, which means he is, most likely, the sole songwriter.** They both sing lead on 15 songs, which they actually wrote together. So, by the numbers, it\u2019s clear that Lennon wrote the most songs, but Paul wrote more Number One hits (13*** to John\u2019s 6) for the band. *John wrote I\u2019m Happy Just to Dance with You to which George [Harrison] sings lead; and he wrote I Wanna Be Your Man to which Ringo sings lead (which means, he may have been the sole songwriter on 75 songs) **Paul wrote With a Little Help from My Friends and Yellow Submarine to which Ringo sings lead (which means, he may have been the sole songwriter on 68 songs) ***although, Ringo sings lead on Yellow Submarine (#1 in 1966), Paul is the sole songwriter ",

            "answer_text": "Early on many of the songs were a joint effort so I won\u2019t include those songs as they were equally responsible for writing them. Of all the songs the Beatles recorded John had 72 songs where he was the main songwriter. Paul had 70 where he was the main songwriter. George wrote 22 songs and Ringo wrote 2. So by a narrow margin of 2 songs it was John since he wrote 72 to Paul\u2019s 70. Basically they were pretty equal in their contributions in terms of number of songs anyway. For me at least it isn\u2019t necessarily about numbers as much as it was about the quality of each song. Early on John wrote more hit songs than Paul did but that soon changed to where they were about equal and then Paul later on wrote more hits than John by quite a big margin. So I think it\u2019s safe to say that Paul wrote more hit songs than John though John was not as concerned about the commerciality of the songs as much as Paul was. Both were fabulous songwriters and fair equal as afr was songwriting ability goes but it really comes down to personal preference and doesn\u2019t really factor into this particular question. ",

            "answer_text": "There's no hard and fast answer, since there are so many factors to consider, in particular how you assign authorship to their collaborations, whether you count songs either wrote for other performers, and whether you restrict the answer to with the Beatles or lifetime output. Generally speaking, John and Paul contributed equally to 17 songs. John wrote 61 songs and Paul 43, with John dominating the Beatles' early years and Paul their later years. However, Paul wrote more #1 hits for the Beatles, 10, to John's 6. As a solo artist, John recorded 150 songs (though it's unclear how many were solo written and not with Yoko or someone else), and while I can't find an exact count for Paul his total appears to be somewhere north of 500. But the comparison is unfair since Paul has outlived John by 40 years, remaining creative the whole time. ",

There are some mediocre and some fantastic songs that he has released under other names , (the Fireman) & allowed other artists to use and some that is available on on youtube as called Fab Trax volume 1 to 4 . There\u2019s driving in the rain in the new century and many songs that he has allowed other artists to sing . So with John\u2019s untimely death , there were a few songs that were only demo tapes but even taking that into account there are FAR more McCartney songs out there. For years John was during the dutiful Daddy job while Paul has been churning out songs non stop . ( an enormous amount of songs ) He even helped mis brother Mike ( mcGear- he didn\u2019t want to trade off Pauls name ) & do some albums . I in 1974 Paul played and produced it . Then there was Badfinger, Mary Hopkins , Peter & Gordon and Billy J Kramer and quite a few other doing Pauls songs ! ",

But, I did a count of the Beatles number 1 songs and Paul had about 1 or 2 more of those than John. John tended to get the biggest piece of the pie in The Beatles because he started the group, he was older than all but Ringo, and he was also very talented and strong-willed. I remember this story about the white album. Paul had the idea to print small sequential numbers on the cover every white album (the old vinyl albums). Mine was about number 400,000. The 4 Beatles got numbers 1 through 4. Paul got number 2. Guess who got number 1? ",

Seriously, I think Lennon-McCartney were credited with about nine out of ten songs on the albums. A few they wrote together, more usually one acting as the quality control over the other. Towards the beginning, John wrote slightly more of the hits than Paul. Towards the end, Paul was dominant. As far as precise numbers, perhaps one of the more nerdy Quora people could break it down song by song. All in all, Lennon and McCartney were by no means equal, but the parity between them was amazingly equal. ",

The introduction for And I love her is by George. And Paul create lots of sounds for Strawberry Fields Forever and also for Tomorrow Never knows. In fact, the psychodelic sound in both songs were Paul\u2019s idea. The only thing we can say is which one had most of his first idea recorded. It was John\u2019s.

If you mean while they were in The Beatles, John wrote more songs by a slim margin, due to the significantly larger amount he wrote in the band\u2019s early years. Paul\u2019s dominance as a songwriter came in the late 60\u2019s and gradually caught up to John\u2019s total, but never quite managed to exceed the amount that John had written. ",

Dowlding in his book, Beatlesongs, attempts to break it down by examining each song, and referring whenever possible to material and information gleaned from various interviews and quotes - mostly from the group\u2019s members. Mr. Dowlding - who I might add did a nice job in a book that is quite informative and fascinating - broke each song down to who contributed what, if anything, regardless of who was credited (I.e Lennon and McCartney). Here is what he came up with; these are the number of songs recorded and officially released by The Beatles written by various writers: Johe Lennon: 84.55 songs Paul McCartney: 73.65 songs George Harrison: 22.15 songs Ringo Starr: 2.7 songs The above counts total 183.05 songs. The other 25.95 songs were written or co-written by approximately 25 other different people. This totals - at the time of the book\u2019s publication - 209 Beatle songs released (1989). Thanks! ",

He has been doing this now for 49 almost 50 years since he left the Beatles. But, John\u2019s life was cut short in 1980, just barely ten years after the band split.
