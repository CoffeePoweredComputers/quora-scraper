            "answer_text": "I think there are a few primary reasons for this. The feature is still very well-hidden. In fact, in getting ready to write this answer I took a look at the desktop app and literally could not find the feature (I could have sworn there was a central page for podcasts and subscriptions somewhere, but for the life of me I cannot find it right now). The only way to surface podcasts, at least as far as I have looked, is via the search bar. This means the average user will likely never be exposed to podcasts in Spotify for the life of their membership.Ranking. Podcasts have historically been ranked dead last in Spotify searches unless they are one of the only things to turn up for a particular search query. There\u2019s a very good reason for this:Product priority. Spotify is a music-centered company. It always has been, and I\u2019d venture to say it always will be \u2014 once a company like this introduces itself as \u201cthe\u201d place for listening to music, it\u2019s not easy to introduce a new type of media, even if that media is still simply audio files. For example, when Rdio (rip, I loved Rdio and miss it to this day) launched Vdio, its online video streaming and rental service, in mid-2013, it failed within 9 months [1]. Spotify has gone to great lengths to assert itself as the app for listening to music, and this has come at the cost of not being able to corner the podcast client market.The podcast market is still developing. Even if Spotify did want to prioritize podcasts as a core product feature, it would not make sense for them because the ROI is not high enough. They likely make little to no money from listing podcasts within their product, and podcast ad agencies currently license ads straight to individual podcasts themselves (or to podcast networks), so Spotify wouldn\u2019t get a cut unless it ran its own proprietary podcast network. If you need proof of this, look at how few desktop podcast listening platforms there are (hint: there\u2019s only one, a Mac app called Downcast \u2014 no, iTunes doesn\u2019t count), and look at how many podcast listener apps are coming out on iOS to try to fill this void and get in ahead of the game. It doesn\u2019t make sense for Spotify to try competing in this space given the fact that no other major company has pursued podcasts as a source of revenue or as a new feature.Format. Podcasts have a specific format. Often times, podcasts will have show notes containing links, images, or other media, and Spotify has no place to show those items. Other apps, such as Overcast and yes, even the little engine that couldn\u2019t, iTunes, have places for these episode descriptions.Cost. I mentioned this briefly in #4, but it\u2019s worth mentioning again because it\u2019s so important. Spotify is focused on music, and it makes its money from music and from the users who pay to listen to it. Music involves licensing deals, potential royalties, lucrative partnerships, and more in an industry that has more money than it knows what to do with. This means focusing on music pays the bills. Podcasts, at this point in time, certainly do not. They are a zero-sum love affair for many podcasters who publish episodes simply out of a passion for sharing stories and knowledge. Spotify would need to invest considerable resources just to make focusing more on the podcasts feature a viable product decision. Their goal is to corner the music market and choke out Pandora, Apple Music, and the various tangential services (Amazon and Google\u2019s streaming services). Spotify can let the others go for podcasts, because they know music will always be a lucrative business but hedging on podcasts becoming a rich business is not the best choice they could make.Context. Again, Spotify is a music app. Podcasts do not fit in this context. Playlists are not tailored for podcasts; podcasts do not fit in their Discover Weekly algorithms or in their other discovery platforms. They would need to build out a whole new suite of pages and tools for enabling the growth of podcasts as a feature at scale.Fragmentation. The podcast world is fragmented, in that podcasts may not be on iTunes or another shared podcast feed aggregator, meaning Spotify would need to do a lot of engineering work to keep their podcasts up to date by pulling feeds from multiple different locations and parsing this data into a usable format. I suspect this is the core reason that many podcasts aren\u2019t even on Spotify: do a search for a niche podcast that you frequently listen to in iTunes and it likely will not even turn up a result in Spotify\u2019s search. I think Spotify has a lot of other core product problems to solve before they ever should think about focusing more on their podcasts product. Discovery, personalization, quality, categorization, search, and social design (i.e. not having a hacked-together \u201csocial network\u201d inside the app) are all things they should really pay attention to now before shifting gears. Spotify\u2019s auto-generated playlists and discovery tabs are getting worse and worse with scale as the platform becomes saturated with miscategorized (and mis-attributed) music, and they seem to me to have left product thinking behind in favor of constant visual design iteration and branding efforts \u2014 a misstep from their design leadership, in my humble opinion. I myself have wished numerous times that Spotify would focus more on podcasts, because the market for a great podcast client is entirely dry and could use serious attention by someone willing to take it in a positive direction. iTunes will never, ever cut it for this (or anything, really). Spotify won\u2019t either. Our best hope for great podcast clients comes from indie app developers making apps like Overcast, Castro, Pocket Casts, and the many others that are working very hard to create a great listening and cataloging experience for users.  [1]: Sure, there are myriad other factors that contributed to this, and the comparison between Vdio and Spotify Podcasts is not direct nor concrete, this is still a good example of how difficult is to introduce a new use case into a very product that has highly specific use cases already.

            "answer_text": "I can think of a few reasons. The main thing, Spotify hasn\u2019t figured out how to work with podcasts. Without knocking what Spotify does, their platform is limited\u2026and not a good partner for podcasts. Take my show for instance, the Break It Down Show, I have to constantly contact Spotify to keep my show current on their website\u2014which takes enough time that I don\u2019t chose to do it anymore.  They can\u2019t seem to find a way to keep all of the shows current.  When I do get through, which is tough to do\u2026nothing gets accomplished. This makes the relationship between podcasts and Spotify onerous.People want current episodes.  Again, my show? the current episode is nearly a year old. Jay Mohr\u2019s podcast, \u201cMohr Stories\u201d not a single show\u2026I can do this all day.  The site is terrible about getting shows. iTunes can publish shows, why can\u2019t Spotify?What\u2019s the benefit of listening on Spotify?  As a podcast producer, especially for businesses, I have no incentive to have people listen on the Spotify App.  Spotify does a great job of constantly offering their premium membership\u2026but there\u2019s nothing done for the podcast. I\u2019d rather have my listeners come to my site and directly support the show. In all honestly, Spotify is worried about Spotify\u2026that reflects in what their customers experience\u2026which directly impacts their ability to keep podcast listeners engaged.Spotify chooses to be something other than excellent in their support of podcasts, that more than anything drives their success.
