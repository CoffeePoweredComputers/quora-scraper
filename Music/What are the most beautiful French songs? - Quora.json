            "answer_text": "What is some of the best French music? I\u2019ve been a DJ for 15 years\u2026 you need to be really more precise about your taste. It all depends what your style is, and if you\u2019re advance enough to leave the classics behind and go for rap and pop. Now I will give you an answer based on music that you could be given in a french class at different level and still be cool and most of their songs would fit the description. Classic (crooner, big bands, my parent\u2019s classics) : Edith Piaf, Charles Aznavour, Charles Trenet, Bourvil, Fernandel, Ray Ventura. Jacques Brel. Jazz, Jazzy : Claude Nougaro, Dany Brillant, Morane, Boris Vian, Le grand orchestre du Splendid. Poets, Engaged, Avant Garde. Leo ferre, Serge Reggiani, Georges Brassens, Babara, Juliette Greco. Rap : Claude MC Solaar, Maitre Gimms (select carefully, not all the songs could suitable) Folk : Tri Yann, Yann Stevel, Sixties : the ones who did some careers. Johnny Halliday, Nino Ferrer, Jacques Dutronc, Eddie Mitchell (with or without the Chaussettes Noires), Sylvie Vartan, Polnareff, Serge Gainsbourg (!! his eighties songs are for most rated \u201cR.\u201d !!) Seventies : Johnny Halliday, Nino Ferrer, Jacques Dutronc, Eddie Mitchell, Sylvie Vartan, Michel Sardou, yes, the same ones, they\u2019re so good. Eighties : Etienne Daho, Telephone, Indochine, Jean-Jacques Goldman, Michel Berger, France Gall. Francis Cabrel, Renaud Nineties : Etienne Daho, Telephone, Indochine, Jean-Jacques Goldman, Michel Berger, France Gall. Francis Cabrel, Renaud, Noir Desir (indy Rock). 2000 and now : William Balde, Natasha St Pier, Renaud (come back), Grand Corp Malade, Yannick Noah And so on, I\u2019ve tried to be eclectic, and for all kind of taste, these artists are still the one you will hear on the french radios, and they are the typical that you would put on a wedding\u2019s playlist for background or dancing, it doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re too commercial, but they will fit a wide public.
