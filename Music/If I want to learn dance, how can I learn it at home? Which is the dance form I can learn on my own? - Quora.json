            "answer_text": "You always have an option for online learning ..like, what I mean is you get several channels or individuals on youtube who upload videos for learning many of the western and indian classical dance forms. If not anything else i'm sure u can learn the western or hipop dance styles by watching and following those videos. Also if u have any of ur friend who knows or is well informed about dance..u can call up him/her your home,learn some elementary steps..i think dats better for a startup and once u get a grip u'll hve more ideas to learn nd flourish.And yes of-course; u can even try to convince your father a little bit, just give it a try.Actually its the 1st time I'm being helpful to someone on Quora. Please let me know if u have any suggestions for me.Hope this helped\\U0001f60a ",
