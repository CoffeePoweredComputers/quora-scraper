            "answer_text": "Hell yeah. It depends on the definition of vulgar. I like music that twists and slyly quotes from other pieces. The third movement of Tchaikovsky 6 is great and uplifting, but a bit vulgar. It took me weeks to play it with serious intent. It's so over the top that it is hilarious. But the next movement is serioso again with low, dark,sad notes. My real favourite is PDQs Two pianos vs orchestra with John kimura Parker. In the second movement there's that famous clarinet solo from Gershwin\u2019s Rhapsody in blue. The first movement has a great bit of orchestration with as usual, for pdq, percussion producing interesting tubular bell notes, which I recognise now as a quote from Liberty Bell. Vulgar? The Monty Python them tune ( liberty bell again). Malcolm Arnold's Flash Harry motif from the St Trinian's films - the originals from the 1960s ",
