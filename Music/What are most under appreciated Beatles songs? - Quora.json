            "answer_text": "Super Fun Question! Off the top of my head, these are some of my favorites that rarely pop up in discussions of their best songs. I\u2019ve Just Seen A Face - the number 1 reason why I agree with Steve Van Zandt that the altered, resequenced and shortened American version of Rubber Soul is even better than the album\u2019s original British pressing.And Your Bird Can Sing - Two minutes of pure joy.Mother Nature\u2019s Son - A barely there ephemeral oddity, but one of their most beautiful songs.Everybody\u2019s Got Something To Hide But Me And My Monkey - Possibly the most exciting guitar work out (that I think they played themselves) in their catalog.Paperback Writer - maybe a cheat on this one, it was a number one song, but this has always felt like one of their most ambitious efforts to me - going for a Pet Sounds/Good Vibrations level of instrumental sophistication.Baby, You\u2019re A Rich Man - have always enjoy this silly number.She\u2019s Leaving Home - Not as big a Sgt. Peppers fan as many, have always felt it\u2019s their weakest collection of songs amongst the big 5, but something about this maudlin song has always touched a nerve in my heart - the one song on the domestic themed Peppers that gets in the ballpark of what the Kinks were knocking out of the park regularly at same time on these kind of small life domestic themes.Here, There, and Everywhere - probably one of their absolute greatest ballads, but is rarely discussed as such.Tomorrow Never Knows - another one of their all time greatest efforts that rarely gets discussed as such.I\u2019ll Follow The Sun - just a lovely early career ditty.",

            "answer_text": "Thank You Girl, because of Ringo in the end; Yes It Is, no matter what Lennon said about it being an inferior rewrite of This Boy, because of the harmonies; Ditto with Baby's In Black; The Inner Light and Love You To; Throw in Within You Without You because of George; Revolution 9; I'm Only Sleeping; She Said She Said; Dear Prudence; Old Brown Shoe; Think For Yourself; Don't Bother Me because it's one weird chord progression for 1963 in a pop rock band. Quite honestly, there are no underrated nor ignored Beatles songs nowadays. Everybody bakes a cake over every single one of them. ",
