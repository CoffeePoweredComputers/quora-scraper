Some of the most influential musicians have never even been nominated. The Grammy\u2019s are for the general not-really-listening-to-the-radio public, and the sharklike industry members. Occasionally they get it right, but that\u2019s rare. The only reason to watch is if someone you like plays a song. As a teenager, I saw a middle-aged Dion play a slow and sad acoustic version of his \u201860\u2019s hit \u201cTeenager in Love.\u201d And it was so brilliant in it\u2019s new context. That was the late \u201880\u2019s, and about the last time I saw one worth watching. ",

They won seven times in total when taking into account lifetime achievement awards. But, that being said, I hardly think it made any difference in their careers. Nor do I think that the awards, or lack of them, would help boost the resume of a band like the Beatles. Footnotes[1] The Beatles",
