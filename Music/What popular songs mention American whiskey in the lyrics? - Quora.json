            "answer_text": "I can think of several whiskey river sang by Willie Nelson. Whiskey lullaby Alison Krauss. Carrie underwood wine after whiskey Johnny Cash wrote a boy named Sue in it he mentions a bottle of booze. One bourbon one scotch and one beer by John Lee Hooker. Before somebody writes a post remember scotch rye Bourbon are whiskeys I believe all scotch are whiskey but not all whiskeys are Scotch whiskey. There are several songs I could mention like this that mention alcohol but it\u2019s debatable whether it\u2019s whiskey like white lightning search Jones. I don\u2019t know if you could call white lightning whiskey. And I don\u2019t want to start a controversy because there are several popular songs that mention alcohol. Which could be whiskey. Tony Bennett\u2019s one for the road leave it to your imagination he doesn\u2019t say what he\u2019s drinking but I bet my bottom dollar it\u2019s whiskey. Then there\u2019s the American classic rye whiskey Pete Seeger. Honorable mention all I wanna do is have some fun Sheryl crow doesn\u2019t mention whiskey but really is a bar song. They\u2019re probably more bar songs or songs about alcohol and more songs that mention whiskey but right now I can\u2019t think of them. ",
