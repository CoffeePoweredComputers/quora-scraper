            "answer_text": "Why does singing sound so different live from studio? There are many reasons. Vocal performances recorded in a studio are generally done \u2018dry\u2019 - that is, close to the microphone and with no additional room charactersitics. All the colouring you hear on such a performance, such as reverberation, changes to equalisation and compression, is added afterward. It can sound quite natural, but in modern music production it\u2019s usually fairly stylised. Natural acoustic vocal, on the other had, is highly coloured by the environment in which you hear it. If you\u2019re talking about your own voice, there are the added effects you get from hearing parts of it via bone conduction and internal resonance. Many people find it diconcerting to hear their recorded voice, because \u2018it doesn\u2019t sound like it does to me\u2019. ",

            "answer_text": "What makes a singers voice at a show/concert sound so different from a voice recorded in the studio? The largest factors are the acoustical environment the voice is being miced in, and the listening environment. Concert halls are very reverberant, the space is huge and uncontrolled. The sound system causes the voice to bounce off the walls, creating secondary reflections, these may be picked up by the mic, and added to the signal. A studio is a controlled acoustic environment, secondary reflections are often diffused with special apparatus, softening the reverberant field. In almost all cases, the microphones used in the studio will be a Large Diaphragm Condenser as opposed to the Dynamic mic used live. These mics are more sensitive, have a wider bandwidth, and are often run through very high end microphone pre amplifiers. All these differing factors make for a very unique sound in both cases, and are a good part of what make each event special from an acoustical and technical standpoint. ",
