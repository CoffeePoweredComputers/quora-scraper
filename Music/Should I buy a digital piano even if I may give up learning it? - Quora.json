            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been playing for 21 years. I trained not only classically; \u2192 I also played in an (electronic) keyboard orchestra. With that said \u2192 I think there is a difference between learning to play a keyboard and learning to play the piano. If you think you\u2019re learning to play piano by learning to play a keyboard, then respectfully I think you are mistaken. I don\u2019t think my piano teacher would have taken me if I did not have an actual piano at home to practice on. It would have been in the 1990s when I got my first piano; my grandmother bought it for me for $500. At about the same time I purchased a Casio keyboard that had keys that were smaller than standard; not weighted; and, it didn\u2019t have all the keys a piano has. It cost $600. So, the economics is pretty clear. The bigger burden is where am I going to put the piano, for if you can afford an electronic keyboard, likely you can afford a decent old piano. I still keep that big behemoth that is probably 100 years old \u2014 that I learned classical piano on, all those years ago \u2014 for sentimental value; plus, it plays honkytonk, hymns, and Neil Young better than my Yamaha (but I\u2019m not there yet). When I went off to university in 2001, I could not bring that piano (or, at least, I didn\u2019t move it). For years, all I had was my keyboard. By that time I was at advanced level, but certainly no virtuoso. I used the keyboard to write music. After college, I was able to get an apartment big enough to have a spare bedroom in which I could set up both my DJ turntable setup and a piano \u2014 a mini recording studio if you will. I began to practice Chopin\u2019s nocturnes (all of them) on my Casio keyboard; after a while I had mastered them all. I knew, then, that buying a better (and more appropriate) instrument was prudent, so I shopped around. In Houston, if you say your name is Jared, the other person will think of two things: 1) the pedophile Subway guy, or 2) the jeweler. I went to the Yamaha store and played around on the grands, baby grands, and new uprights. I went upstairs and played on the used pianos. When I walked out the door, the salesman got on the $150,000 concert grand and played the Diamonds are forever song as I walked out the door. I eventually found a Yamaha U3 \u2014 used piano; from a university music department \u2014 that was perfect for me. It was $6,500; at that time the new version of the same cost over $13,000. Later, I realized its strings are as long as a full-sized grand; that\u2019s why it sounded so nice (even though my cousin, who has a degree in piano performance, told me Chopin should not be played on a Yamaha!). Uprights are more portable; uprights are cheaper. Used pianos are still good pianos; they only appreciate in value. They are not keyboard instruments despite what is taught in school to children these days. I had a debate with a public school music teacher who informed me that pianos are keyboard instruments. I would say that keyboards are keyboard instruments. Pianos are percussion instruments. You don\u2019t have to start out with something expensive in order to start out learning, and playing, on a piano. You can find a used piano that is cheaper than an electronic keyboard. And, if you want to learn piano, you can\u2019t learn on a digi keyboard. They have their uses. It\u2019s also true that, if you want to learn how to bake an apple pie, you can\u2019t do it with pears using a recipe for a tart. Uprights take up less room, and they are easier to move. \u2014 So, to directly answer your question \u2014 you will never know if you will keep up with the practice that is required to become a pianist. Don\u2019t hinder yourself from the get-go by buying an electronic keyboard. As another person pointed out, the market for piano sales is high. If you buy used, you can sell used. It\u2019s like asking someone if the water is cold when what you want to do is learn to swim. Jump in. That\u2019s how you\u2019ll know. Good luck to ya! ",

            "answer_text": "I guess that is the only way you will ever know if it is something you want to pursue. What I wouldn\u2019t do is go out and buy something expensive to figure out if it\u2019s something you want to do. Check listings on craigslist or go to a pawnshop or music store and find a used one on the cheap. If it doesn\u2019t work out you can get at least most of your money back by selling it. I recently bought a keyboard at an estate sale for $50 and I was thrilled to get for that price because new it was over $1,200 and used they were going for $400-$600. I already had a keyboard but it wasn\u2019t as nice. I rarely use a keyboard when writing music and instead prefer using a guitar but I thought it would be nice to have around so my daughters can learn when they get a bit older. I would encourage you to give it a shot and don\u2019t be quick to give up because music is a wonderful thing. It brings you closer to people and even be a possible future. If you are out somewhere and there is a piano or keyboard and you can sit down and play it will draw people to you and you will be envied and admired by all. ",
