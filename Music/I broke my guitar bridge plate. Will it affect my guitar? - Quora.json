            "answer_text": "How does one even go about breaking a bridge plate? You can chew up or enlarge the holes where the pins go through by years of improper string attachment.A cheap guitar that used the wrong adhesives or failed to properly clamp the bridge plate during construction might have a bridge plate work free along an edge after experiencing great heat or wide changes going up and down in humidity. These can crack or fail to support the top, resulting in a \u201cbelly\u201d in the top.Bridge plates can cup or warp if they are thin and, again, exposed to tensions and forces imposed by heat or humidity changes while under string tension.But to \u201cbreak\u201d it? I am sitting here as a repair guy and occasional builder and wondering how you break one. Removing a bridge plate can be a real bugger of a job and even the best repair people usually get them out only in pieces. Breakage during removal is the only case of an actual broken bridge plate I have experienced while playing inside the guts of guitars since about 1980. It\u2019s not that I disbelieve you, it\u2019s just that it is so rare and the chances may be good that the terminology is being confused. Below is a guitar top under construction. It demonstrates very nice workmanship by Tim Mullin. The bridge plate is the trapezoid piece nestled just under the cross of the \u201cX-braces\u201d below the sound hole. It has not yet been drilled for the bridge pins. I cannot tell for sure, but this is either a flatsawn piece of maple, or, just as likely could be a piece of maple laminate. (From: The unseen luthier's art -- Brace yourself! )  Below is a cutaway view of the top of the guitar where the bridge, soundboard, and bridge plate come together between the large X-braces. You can see how the strings come up against the bridge plate from below and are then solidly \u201ccoupled\u201d to the top of the guitar. (From: http://www.frets.com/FretsPages/Musician/Guitar/Maintenance/CrackedBridges/crackedbridges.html )  These bridge plates are made of hard maple (usually sugar maple in USA made guitars) or, depending on the manufacturer or builder be made of rosewood Or a laminate. Many modern guitars use laminated maple for the bridge plate so they can have multiple layers with differing grain orientations. This makes for a more rigid and stronger base plate\u2014if the lamination process is done properly. THESE are all but impossible to break (and just defy you to remove them!). Bridge plates range in size from fairly small in antique instruments and many classical guitars to the size of coffee tables in 1970s era Martins and their many copies. They can (and do) wear out with lots of string changes and years under string tension and bridge plate repair is common on bridge plates with elongated or enlarged pin holes. Below is a narrow-style bridge plate from a 1937 Martin. You can see the pin holes have become elongated in the maple bridge plate. Still, this is not too bad for an instrument of this age! (from: http://www.frets.com/FretsPages/Musician/Guitar/Maintenance/CrackedBridges/crackedbridges.html )  Below, you can see this not too old bridge plate has the ball ends of the strings being pulled into the wood (see especially the rightmost strings in the photo) and will eventually pull into the soundboard and damage the spruce. Proper attentive string installations prevents this. (From a post on a Gibson forum: Bridge Plate Request ) [Aside: this a a really nice quartersawn piece of maple being used as a bridge plate. The ball ends should not have the opportunity to get pulled into the pin holes in this manner. The fault here is poor string installation or an improper taper on the bridge pins. ]  But let\u2019s say you do have a broken bridge plate\u2014actually broken into at least two pieces, with a serious separation. Yes! Absolutely this is going to impact the guitar\u2014and in nothing but seriously negative ways! The most common problem is the migration of the metal ball ends of the strings upward through the soft spruce soundboard (the \u201ctop\u201d of your guitar). This will add additional stress to the bridge as it is leveraged by the strings over the saddle toward the soundhole. The back of the bridge will lift and may either break along the glue joint or, perhaps more likely, tear out pieces of the soft spruce on its journey upward and \u201cforward\u201d toward the soundhole. That section of the guitar top needs the reinforcement of that bridge plate to help retain the structural integrity of the soundboard. If your bridge plate is cracked, split, or even significantly chewed up around or between the holes for the pins, slacken the strings right away and have a qualified repair person look into it as soon as you can. Avoid catastrophic failure.  Ouch! (From a discussion at: How significant is this bridge lift? ) ",

            "answer_text": "As resident expert Torbjorn Arntsen indicates, the plate is inside an acoustic guitar. It\u2019s rarely seen by the owner, and would need an inspection mirror to do so. Here\u2019s a decent article on the part: Bridge Plate Installation As you may gather, this is largely a matter in the sequential construction of the guitar, not a common repair. Many players (including self until I spent time with a family luthier) don\u2019t know it, thinking instead that it\u2019s the main visible part on top of the guitar face. Let\u2019s call that the bridge base, into which go the bridge saddle(s), and, on a standard acoustic, the bridge pins, comprising what I\u2019ll call the bridge assembly. Here\u2019s a pic of a base being clamped down (noting special clamp): US $8.0 |Acoustic Guitar Bridge Clamp / Cast Steel Deep Throat Clamp / Deep Reach C Clamp Guitar Repair Tool|guitar clamp|for guitar|clamp guitar - AliExpress Having said all that, I\u2019m wondering if the bridge assembly is what\u2019s being asked about. These can go dodgy in several ways, particularly on inexpensive guitars. They can start to \u201clift\u201d, crack, or even go \u201czing\u201d across the room. This may be accompanied by a warping or bellying-down of the face/sound board, which is a fairly clear sign of a poorly constructed guitar-shaped object - or a very inappropriate string tension, or both. It affects the guitar because it\u2019s not that guitar without it. What to do? Same advice as our esteemed expert has already suggested: Take the instrument into a shop for assessment. ",
