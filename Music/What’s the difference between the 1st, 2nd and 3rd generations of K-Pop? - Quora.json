            "answer_text": "What\u2019s the difference between the 1st, 2nd and 3rd generations of K-Pop? Thanks for the A2A. Well I saw all three and only spent any real time with Gen 3 as far as getting to know the groups, caring about the music, etc. I'll give my impressions of those times from what I can remember.  Shinhwa Gen 1 was really weird and really not. It felt like Korea was watching what America was doing and trying to replicate it. But it was like that secret phrase passing game. You have 15 or so people. One whispers to the next \u201cThe leopard with pink stripes carried a Polish man from Russia to Italy in the pouring rain.\u201d By the time it gets whispered down the line of people, the last guy says \u201cThe Russian leopard took a train to Poland with a man in pink shoes.\u201d G1 Kpop was like that. An eschewed version of the original U.S. pop. It was very \u201cpop\u201dtoo. There were still traces of old school Korean music in many pieces, like with violins and pianos and lots of love songs, but the \u201cpopness\" was there. But nothing was particularly crazy. The colored hair craze hadn't taken off yet and idols mostly dressed normally. Well\u2026except for Chakra\u2026  Gen 2 was when the acid trip kicked in.  Some groups are perfect examples of how the bridge from G1 to G2 was built. Early Apink is one. Super Junior is another. I spent all of 5 months dealing with this Gen 2 high before deciding it wasn't for me. But what stuck with me the most was how much it was still decidedly NOT American. Thanks possibly to our phrase-passing fail, K-pop truly was its own thing. It was constantly experimenting with its sound and the biggest scientists in the lab were Big Bang. They took killer risks that always paid off. I couldn't stop watching those guys.  Bands were doing whatever they wanted with their hair in G2. Consequently, there were lots more weaves/extensions. Clothes were peacock extravagant. Girls were dressing sexier on stage. That is to say, I feel like this is when we started seeing nothing but legs ALL THE TIME.  I and my closed mind thought Koreans were brain damaged. 99% of the bands did nothing for me. It felt outdated. The way I feel now watching an early Wonder Girls stage is EXACTLY how I felt watching it then. But no matter what Big Bang did or looked like I still couldn't Stop. Fucking. Watching. I was at the Mets network around 2009. For about 3 months I was working as a sound engineer in this little room and every 30 minutes producers would come in to do live cut-ins for the stadium feed. When they weren't interrupting me, I was on the computer watching Big Bang videos.  Gen 3 feels like it's still keeping its own distinct sound, but always revamping it. There are few traces of that outdated feel in today's groups, but some exist. These groups have lots of flavors to sink your teeth into. Huge groups are becoming more of a thing. Songs are getting edgier. They show up innovating (Blackpink), staying relevant with time (Shinee), continuing Gen 1 sounds, but prospering (Gfriend), taking established concepts and excelling with them (Twice), making up concepts nonstop (Red Velvet), and defying the odds (BTS). G3 feels like it has truly, finally found its musical footing.  They've figured out what works, what doesn't, and they strictly adhere to tried and true procedures and rules. Ironically, though it works, it feels far more manufactured than it ever did before. The singular society is still slow to rise from lowkey racism. But it works. K-pop is better than it was. The factory is meeting the demands with quality supply. Kinda sad though, because the well-oiled machine is built on the backs of exhausted human beings being treated like robots.  Passing the torch. But it works. Thanks for reading. ",

            "answer_text": "Lets put it in very simple terms: 1st Generation: Notable Members: SHINHWA, SEO TAIJI & BOYS, H.O.T, g.o.d, S.E.SAccomplishments: Godparents of KPOP, basically the founders and starters of the genre 2nd Generation: Notable Members: BoA, TVXQ, Super Junior, Rain, Brown Eyed Girls, Wonder Girls, 2PM, KARA, BIGBANG, 2AM, SNSD, BEASTAccomplishments: Broke international barriers, founders of Hallyu Wave, and started elongating group names 3rd Generation: Notable Members: SHINee, B.A.P., Block B, SISTAR, After School, Miss A, B1A4, MBLAQ, Boyfriend, 2NE1Accomplishments: Popularized group names starting with B, focal point of the ever expanding international playing field (especially on youtube, how EXID got famous) 4th Generation: Notable Members: WINNER, BTS, EXO, RV, GOt7, BOTB, EXID, AOAAccomplishments: Major expansion and garnering popularity like never seen before, both domestically and internationally.Notes: This generation was short imo. 5th Generation (current): Notable players: BTS, EXO, Seventeen, IKON, G-Friend, CLC, G-Idle, BlackPink, Twice, Stray Kids, NCT, MOMOLANDNotes: Can\u2019t say much about their accomplishments as of yet, but BTS and Exo are beyond prevalent right now, and alongside TWICE, these groups are leading the international domination of KPOP, and having it become a mainstream genre. All eyes are on them. Also, can people stop bullying me about not including Wanna One and IOI as important members? They\u2019re meant to disband asap. Basically, any group that debuts now, if they make any local impact whatsoever (fighting IMPACT) they\u2019ll join in on the wave, just like MOMOLAND and NCT are now. May have left some things out. Basically, I found the 4th Generation kind of a transition period, but more an important one for KHIPHOP, which started to garner a lot more attention. This is also why 5th Generation KPOP groups have stronger rap lines. Kinda gotta give props to ZICO for breaking that barrier powerfully with his FANCY CHILD crew, though. ",
