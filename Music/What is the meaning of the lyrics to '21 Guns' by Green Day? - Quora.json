            "answer_text": "In my opinion 21 guns is an anti war song and goes into the horrors of war which scar everybody. \u201eDo you know what\u2018s worth fighting for, When it\u2018s not worth dying for?\u201c What\u2018s at stake in this war? Is it important enough that I should give my life for it? What greater good does it serve? \u201eYour faith walks on broken glass, and the Hangover doesn\u2018t pass, nothings ever built to last, you\u2018re in Ruins.\u201c These lines seem to go into PTSD that soldiers face when returning from war, ie The Hangover doesn\u2018t pass. Also, Soldiers may tend to question their religion, ie your faith walks on broken glass. The Anti-War sentiment is brought out in the chorus: \u201e1, 21 guns, lay down your arms, give up the fight. 1, 21 guns, throw up your arms into the sky.\u201c A 21 gun salute is usually used in the military to honor those who have fallen. Here, the pause between the 1 and the 21 shows the 1 who has died and the 21 gun salute fired in his honor. It\u2018s also supposed to show that Peace should be encouraged, and that perhaps these people dying isn\u2018t worth it when peace is an option. So yeah, that\u2018s my opinion on this. Overall I love this song, and the message behind it makes it even better. ",

            "answer_text": "I think this song wants to convey how worthless war or revenge can be. There comes a time when one realises the futile point of fighting carrying all the unbearable pain of his own sins and wrath towards others as u see \u201cdoes the pain weigh out the pride and u look for a place to hide\u201d\u2026. therefore the singer is calling for the end of the fight \u201cONE, twenty one guns\u201d \u2026I think before 21 guns the one has a deeper meaning means \u2018United\u2019 as after the line he says \u201clay down ur arms give up the fight\u201d\u2026. basically giving up the fight after giving the dead the proper burial with honour of 21 guns for which they died for \u2026.my favorite line \u201clike a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone\u201d represents a very worthless act \u2026the liar isn't sorry and still asking for forgiveness which has no point and that also from a stone (maybe a heartless person) who isn't going to forgive the liar anyway so more worthless ",
