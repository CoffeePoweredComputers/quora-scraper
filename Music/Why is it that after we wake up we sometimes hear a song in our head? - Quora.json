            "answer_text": "I am going to slightly contradict the popular opinion that things in our dreams are just stuff from the previous day jumbled up. This is definitely not my experience, and nor I think that considered by decent psychologists. Our minds do not work in a literal way, most of our waking life we think, talk and experience in very literal terms - modern society expects us to be simple, direct and literal. Our minds however seem to work metaphorically, linking various things together not by scientific classification, but by related personal meanings and emotions. Dreams are not about the things you see in them, generally they are metaphors to represent the things your subconscious is concerned with, often in ways you have not consciously connected. Recently I have had dreams about past pet cats. I dream that I have forgotten to feed them for ages and need to do so. Its not because I recently talked about my cats or a brand of cat food, its a metaphor that is telling me there are responsibilities my subconscious believes I am not taking care of. This is in fact true, and it is the emotion which is real, not what I see or hear. If you wake with a song in your head, it can be pretty cool to (a) think about the lyrics or (b) the emotion of the song. Either of these may be a window into what your subconscious is thinking about, often they are related to your previous day or to up coming events, but metaphorically rather than because you heard that song recently. If it is \u201cBaby Shark\u201d however, that is because Baby Shark is annoying as hell and will not get out of my head! ",

            "answer_text": "There is actually a word for having a song stuck in your head. It is called an \u201cearworm.\u201d When you sleep, your brain processes images and information that it has seen during the day. It takes snapshots of these images and stores them in your memory. Earworms are sort of like the audio version of these. Our brain usually attaches to memories that are hard to forget. Catchy simple tunes are good examples. If you have had recent exposure to music or if someone says a word that triggers a memory of a certain song, your brain is likely to attach to it, and you are likely to process it to your memory during the night, which may explain why you wake up with it in your head. If you don\u2019t mind waking up this way - great! If you do, you might try avoiding Lady Gaga, Beyonce, Adele, Queen, and Abba. Doctors say these are the ones most likely to cause earworms. I am going to send you a link to some of our sleep products that you might want to check out to help you sleep better. Maybe you\u2019ll see something you like! Hope that answers your question! Good luck and enjoy! All Products All Products ",
