            "answer_text": "Depending on your preferences, the choices can change. Most companies have easily manageable and navigable websites that lead you to their audition sites. Companies like JYP have a separate website for their auditions, and YG and SM both have downloadable forms that you can fill out. Look into different companies, their history, artist treatment, etc. You won\u2019t want to end up signing with a company like TS. Online auditions are not easy. Not only are your chances getting in more than slim, the possibility of debut is even slimmer. Most artists who debut are scouted by agents. Consider if this is actually what you want to do before auditioning. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. Best of luck :) ",
