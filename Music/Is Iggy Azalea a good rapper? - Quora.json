            "answer_text": "Asking if someone is a good rapper is sort of like asking if someone is a good painter. I'll answer subjectively, then. I like listening to her. The southernish accent she's adopted is a little too broad and sometimes feels like a caricature of Da Brat -- but I love Da Brat, so I can deal. She generally doesn't say anything particularly deep and her wordplay isn't stunning, but she's amusing. Her flow is good. She certainly benefits from great production, which always helps boost middling rapping (ahem, Kanye). ",

            "answer_text": "My answer would be a definite NO. Rappers are judged on the basis of the rhymes they create, the lyrics they spit and the messages they deliver. Iggy Azalea doesn\u2019t even write her own her lyrics. She\u2019s the only rapper who outsources her lyrics from someone. The credit for her success mainly goes to Charli XCX and Ariana Grande. She\u2019s a good financial no-brainer who has made a lot of money. And now its time to leave. ",
