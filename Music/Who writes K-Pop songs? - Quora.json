            "answer_text": "It depends, usually at the state of \"debut'' or the start of a band/group/solo artist it's mainly the company's employer who writes the songs to the group. However later on, the group or some of the group members can write their own songs and lyrics and seek the approval of the company to record it. Bigger groups and solo artists write their own songs and have the right to record them by their own if the company's given them the approval in the contract :) ",
