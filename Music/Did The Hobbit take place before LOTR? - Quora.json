They leave Rivendell at the end of that same year. Most of Lord of the Rings takes place in 3019 Third Age. The Third Age ends in 3021 around the time that Gandalf, Elrond, Bilbo, and Frodo leave for Valinor. Sam himself leaves for Valinor in Fourth Age 61. Aragorn dies in Fourth Age 120. Arwen dies in an unknown place in 121. A copy of the Red Book of West March (basically the Hobbit + Lord of the Rings) is copied down by the king\u2019s historian in 172. ",
