            "answer_text": "It's actually ALL in the fingers.  100%.  You can get the sound with any bass or amp or combination thereof. You will need a pretty new set of roundwound strings - the brighter the better.   Turn up the treble - not the real high highs but the high mids.  You want that bright clatter but not the high high fizz.  An overdriven high mid is key. Actually the Rick he used on Cygnus X-1 had a poor low end response on the E string - you can hear it in the tune; as the EQ on the bass sound develops from that far-away echoey sound to the full on present bass tone, you notice that when he belts the E it's not quite as full as the high E or the other notes.  Funny that!  All the basses I had in those days had the same problem actually. Anyway, what you need to do is whack those strings!  Get your right hand an inch or two above the string and belt it.  Follow through; don't pluck it, you're hitting that string to within an inch if its life.  Don't mute or choke the strings in any way; let them ring. And if you check his tone on Moving Pictures you see that it's totally different.  There he uses the Jazz bass, and the signal is split.  The low and low mids are clean and punchy.  The high mids and highs are overdriven; to me it's too much, and the two parts of the split signal are just a but too separate. Check the ending of Red Barchetta - it's just a bit too fuzzy; not the overridden clatter of the Rick.  The album is great, I'm not dissing it one bit, but it's a step off the Geddy tone we got used to on Hemispheres and Farewell to Kings. But I digress. Watch videos of how he plays.  It's pretty hard, and it looks like he's using two fingers at once sometimes to get an even harder attack. But he's not delicately plucking them.  If you wanna delicately pluck, go get a P-bass and a Tower of Power album and be Rocco Prestia.  That's great in itself but it ain't Rush! I was in a music shop the other day and they had a really nice 4 string American Jazz - I played Cygnus X-1 on it and it sounded amazing!  The Jazz has just the right sort of high end for it.  I can see why Geddy uses them exclusively now, instead of the Ricks.  I love the Rick tone; all of Farewell to Kings has it and it's fantastic!  Not to mention Yes, Chris Squire and Roundabout or Long Distance Runaround!  But the Jazz is a bit fuller, to my mind.  (Although see above, about Moving Pictures). And when you play really fucking hard like that, you kill the low end just a bit.  The strings can't develop it, and the pickups can't pick it up.  When you bash like that, you're gonna lose lows.  So the Jazz is good for that. But the ultimate 70s prog rock clattery bass tone is, of course, Cygnus X-1.  And you can sound like that with just a bit of amp twiddling and the right fingerstyle attack. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "below are images of my set up  for reference. just so you don't think i am playing Kent bass thriugh a traynor cube amp.          As a bass player with over 38 years the bass, amp and effects hafe some affect but 90% is in the fingering  look up Scott Devine for great leasons and any level of player. i use 7 basses on stage during a show and outside of my flat wound string hofner  when ever i hear myself live or in studio it is like no matter what  i do i sound the same . Studio work from 25 years ago or live with different basses sound within a few degrees the same. Why, because my fingering style and how i strike or pluck a string, or mute etc. is contrant. really , learn to sound like you and not others . if they wanted to have you sounding like someone they would have hired you in the first place to do the record . Be different, learn your own sound and style that results in others will and wonder 'hey how do I sound like him '  BE YOUR OWN PLAYER, BE YOUR OWN SOUND, BE YOUR OWN MUSICIAN - Why --- its already been done, there  is already one of them, the world doesn't need two of them - it needs one of you and only one with improvements on styles you have learned when growing  as  a player .  One on Geddy note there was modification done to his 70's guitars that i won't get into. This i know 100% as i use the same luither on my Ricks that Geddy used so it gives mm me a butbif a edge to get the sound closer if i felt like it but as i said, is been done so it's more for playability than sound since until Geddy offers to have his hands inplanted on mine, he will sound like him and we all will continue to sound as we should , individuals.

            "answer_text": "Geddy Lee\u2019s tone tends to be midrange-y and overdriven. Use your EQ to dial some mids into your tone, and experiment with overdrive pedals (or the preamp on your amp) to add a bit of grit. The Boss ODB-3 is a good option, because it allows you to mix overdriven and dry signal. That makes it easier to get some buzz on top w/o loosing the lows. If you have the option of using a tube amp. It\u2019ll get you part of the way there. Standard caveats about tone being in your fingers apply. But you can get your own version of something similar to his sound with your fingers and the right gear. ",

            "answer_text": "From what I've read over the years, Geddy used his Rickenbackers on Hemispheres, running them through an overdriven Traynor 2x15\" combo amp, and also direct to the desk via a Neve tube compressor. You'll get close with a Ricky and a SansAmp with a modest amount of overdrive added. Play fingerstyle and hit the strings pretty hard - a lot of the overdrive you hear is natural rather than from the amplification.   Bear in mind though, through all the years he's been playing and all the gear he's used, you can still always tell it's Geddy. So much of his tone is in his fingers.  ",

And later on , used a Steinberger bass (be careful there are lot of cheap ones, and even cheap Steinbergers, but his was one of the more top end Steinberger headless model basses. Also used bass pedals when he played keys, so I can\u2019t answer for the bass pedals, I think Taurus bass pedals. What a great bass player. ",
