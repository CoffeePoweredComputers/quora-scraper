            "answer_text": "i think yes. TWICE is obviously more successful and popular than BLACKPINK. why? because: First thing TWICE has WAAAAY more album sales than BLACKPINK. TWICE is number one girl group in album sales. they\u2019re number 1 in top 30 overall, number 1 in top 10 korea, and number 1 in top 10 japan while blackpink comes in the 5th, 7th, and 3rd place.second thing is just because BLACKPINK has more followers on instagram and views, subscribers on youtube that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re more popular. these stuff can be easily purchased and evidence for this is that youtube deleted 10M views from BTS\u2019 MV boy with luv when it was about to break kill this love record. idk it\u2019s just my opinion that YG can actually do something like this because if they\u2019re really \u201cthis\u201d popular why aren\u2019t they selling their album? why aren\u2019t they able to sell out their american shows and keep in mind there were a lot of promotions for their tour? and why did YG lie about the concerts being sold out while they weren\u2019t and this leads to my third point.BLACKPINK weren\u2019t able to sell out their american tour concerts and YG lied about it and said that all the concerts where sold out but when fans searched on tickets websites they found out that the tickets were far from selling out, and they\u2019re now done with their tour with 36 shows and 300k fan attended while TWICE just started their tour with only 5 shows and more than 200k fan came\u2026. what if after more 5 shows TWICE can get 400k with only approximately 10 shows????????and my last point is BLACKPINK were nominated for exactly 101 awards and only won 24 while TWICE were nominated 185 awards and won 77.note: you can actually go and search all this up if you don\u2019t believe it but followers, views, subscribers doesn\u2019t make you a successful artist. period.

            "answer_text": "Is TWICE more popular than BlackPink? you need to decide if you\u2019re comparing success or popularity, and then you need to define it when creating your arguments, otherwise it turns into a mess.Alright although I don\u2019t want to step in, I don\u2019t think you can compare the popularity of both that well, and here are some issues that I found with other answers and comments. Issues with Comparisons: 1) I noticed in some of the earlier answers and respective comments people brought up the amount of views on TWICE\u2019s youtube channel vs the amount of views on BLACKPINK\u2019s. It should be worth noting that TWICE\u2019s MVs aren\u2019t on their youtube channel, they\u2019re on JYP\u2019s. However, BLACKPINK has their music videos on their actual channel. If you add the 4134 million views from the MVs on the JYP channel to the views on TWICE\u2019s actual channel you get a much larger number (around 5486 million views). Granted this is still less than the amount of views for BLACKPINK, but for the sake of fair comparison, I think it is worth noting. Also, even the amount of non-music content is split differently which will end up leading into my second point. BP had their BLACKPINK House show on YouTube, which all in all would add 81 million views for them (seems small compared to the overall amount of views but it adds up). TWICE however, has some of their twice tv seasons exclusively on v-live, so they are essentially missing views on youtube for content. 2) My second topic is other platforms, specifically v-live. As I mentioned earlier, twice has some content on v-live that is not on youtube and vice versa for blackpink, and some content overlaps which is why comparing views is messy. For those of you who only care about hard numbers though (Twice - 7.3million followers and 488million views) (BlackPink - 10.2million followers and 212 million views) As you can see one has more followers while the other has more views, and it\u2019s just a mess trying to compare views from other platforms. 3) Third topic - sales. As mentioned earlier, TWICE thrashed BP in straight album sales, but you also need to account for streams and how they compare to album sales. I don\u2019t think it is plausible to compare hard album sales and streams from whichever app you choose (spotify, applemusic, maybe a popular foreign equivalent) 4) Fourth topic - regional bias. I can\u2019t say which group is more noticeable (I say this instead of popular so we don\u2019t start a fight) in other parts of the world, but in the US, BP was definitely the one I heard about and got into first, and it was even the GG that led me to Twice. For all I know though, there may be other foreign countries where Twice is the first name you\u2019ll hear about, or the one you\u2019ll hear the most. 5) Fifth topic - media or entertainment presence. Beyond just sales or views, there is also presence in things like talk, reality, or variety shows. Never seen anyone take this into account as of yet, and it would be extremely hard to compare using all shows across all countries Side Note - another reason why you can\u2019t really compare is the sum of all of these factors, it would be almost impossible to pull all shows, views, sales, follows, etc. from all the different countries and all the different apps to compare the bulk sum. And even if you did unless one had greater or lesser amounts of everything it would be hard to compare since something like show appearances may have more influence than views (hypothetical example I\u2019m not saying one is more important) 6) How you compare. As I said earlier, you need to state what you\u2019re comparing, and how you define it otherwise this debate is going to go nowhere. If you want to compare success instead of popularity, or think success means something else than what an answerer or commenter does, please start a new answer. If you try to argue using your own definitions, argue in a new answer. Don\u2019t trash someone\u2019s comparison just because your criterion is different than theirs. Here is an extreme example. A doctor could kill one person to save five critically ill patients. If you think that murdering someone is morally incorrect, then you\u2019d say the doctor shouldn\u2019t kill. If you think that just the best outcome for the greatest number of people is the morally correct thing, then you\u2019d encourage the doctor to kill the person. You can\u2019t compare when you have different definitions of what is correct (in this case of what determines popularity or success) Conclusion - don\u2019t try to compare the two. Both are very popular. Just enjoy the fact that whichever group you support is this dang popular at all. ",
