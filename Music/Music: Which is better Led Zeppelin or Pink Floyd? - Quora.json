            "answer_text": "For me, it\u2019s Led Zeppelin undoubtedly. Their music embodied sex, magic, and power. They were rock gods and enjoyed their success, which came instantly due to their blazing talents both collectively and individually. Success seemed to ruin Pink Floyd on the other hand, their lyrics turned increasingly bitter and cynical after The Dark Side of the Moon, and decades of acrimony and lawsuits followed in the wake of Roger Waters\u2019 departure. Depression and alienation and self-pity were Floyd\u2019s emotional terrain, with brooding and slow music to match. It\u2019s a brilliant soundtrack for your mind, for sure, but it\u2019s seldom fun or sexy or thrilling the way Zeppelin could be. More than their songs or playing it was the stellar production values that set Floyd apart. But I\u2019m not fooled by how great those alarm clocks sounded\u2014-the emphatic way David Gilmour sings the nihilistic lyrics of \u201cTime\u201d makes me giggle: \u201cThe sun is the same in a relative way but you\u2019re older, shorter of breath and ONE DAY CLOSER TO DEATH!\u201d Not exactly my idea of invigorating rock and roll. I disagree with the comments here that Floyd were a better unit than Zep. Both were great units. Jimmy Page talks about the magic principle of the 4 individual members coming together to create a fifth element and that was Zeppelin. Zep\u2019s live shows were far riskier and more improvisational affairs than Floyd\u2019s tightly scripted spectacles, and that kind of nightly spontaneity doesn\u2019t happen without a solid group dynamic. Also, it\u2019s sort of ridiculous to claim that Floyd was the better albums band, when Zeppelin has historic albums like II, IV, and Physical Graffiti to their credit. In fact, all of Zeppelin\u2019s first 6 albums are among the very best rock records ever made, and they are all entirely different from each other, unlike Floyd albums which were always pretty much the same moody downers, just getting better produced and more nihilistic as time wore on. I feel if you say Pink Floyd were psychedelic rock, that pretty much covers it. But if you say Zeppelin were hard rock, or just blues/folk, that seems to sell them short. Zep were actually much more sophisticated, intelligent, and wide-ranging than their rep suggests. Yes they gave us the stomping sex groove of \u201cWhole Lotta Love.\u201d But also the gentle whimsy of \u201cDown By The Seaside,\u201d the pastoral beauty of \u201cThe Rain Song,\u201d the grown-up regret of \u201cTen Years Gone,\u201d the heartache of \u201cAll of My Love,\u201d the epic occult journey of the live \u201cDazed and Confused,\u201d the prog pomp of \u201cAchilles Last Stand,\u201d the doomy psychedelia of \u201cNo Quarter,\u201d and the perfect pop of \u201cHouses of the Holy\u201d or \u201cDancing Days.\u201d All immaculately played with unparalleled charisma in their sound. So yeah, two great groups, but one with the clear edge when it comes to great Rock music for me. ",

            "answer_text": "So , this is one of the toughest questions I have ever answered, but I\u2019m gonna make a decision. LED ZEPPELIN : So , this band is one of the greatest bands of Music History.They redefined Rock and Roll.They redefined culture back in the 70s. The group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. The band's heavy, guitar-driven sound has led them to be cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal. Their style drew from a wide variety of influences, including blues, psychedelia, and folk music. They had slow blues like dazed and confused,going to california .Catchy Rock songs like Immigrant SongHeavy Metal Rock like Black DogAnd Last but not the least:THE OUT OF THE WORLD SONG : THE STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN.This song is widely regarded as the BEST SONG OF ALL TIME. The Band is know for the legendary drummer Bonham( whose death lead to their split in 1980) whose solos were sooo epic <3 ,Jimmy Page (you know it right?),and Robert Plant\u2019s Crazy Vocals. If you\u2019re a Rock fan and haven\u2019t heard LED ZEP : BRUH ! :P  And the Fun fact is that, they are know to be timeless because on Celebration day ,2012 when the members where in their 60s and 70s you coud hear the screams and RIFFS as good as back in the good ol\u2019 days ! <3  So , this is my NUMBER 1 Band!!. PINK FLOYD: PINK FLOYD is an epic Classic Rock Band know for their psychedlic instrumentation, introspective lyrics,Slow moody Rock. Pink Floyd were founded by students Syd Barrett on guitar and lead vocals, Nick Mason on drums, Roger Waters on bass and vocals, and Richard Wright on keyboards and vocals. They gained popularity performing in London's underground music scene during the late 1960s, and under Barrett's leadership released two charting singles and a successful debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the band's primary lyricist and conceptual leader, devising the concepts behind their albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), The Wall (1979) and The Final Cut (1983). The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall became two of the best-selling albums of all time  Their Each song had an inner meaning and a back story attached to that.Every PINK FLOYD Album is a Work of ART. As you know, the greatest album of all time ,THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON  ( You must be familiar with this pic :D) Acoustics like Wish you were here ( A Sad one)Crazy Ones like Hey youSymphonies like Shine on you crazy diamondDAMN GOOOD : COMFORTABLY NUMB (THAT SOLO <3 )Dave Gilmour , the lead guitarist is know for his epic solos and Roger waters has that whispering sound that he sings right into the ears. The thing which makes them stand out from other bands is that their MUSIC PRODUCTION AND INSTRUMENTATION. They use bizzare sounds and New instruments in their songs. For example ; The Clock ticking in \u201cTIME\u201d and Money machine\u2019s noise in \u201c MONEY\u201d This is MY NUMBER 1 ( Oops :D ) : Then this is A SPECIAL BAND which you cannot miss. This Band is more of an Experience. CONCLUSION Ew. Every one has that LED ZEPPELIN phase and A PINK FLOYD PHASE.BUT PINK FLOYD STANDS OUT AS A GIANT. PERIOD (PS: I\u2019m just a teenager but I am really into OLD STUFF.SO, pardon for those errors. Phew :D ) ",
