            "answer_text": "Video tutorials offer music experts the opportunity to share their skills with anyone interested enough to watch. While many free tutorials are available on YouTube and other platforms, people looking for quality help will always be happy to pay a fair fee to gain valuable experience from qualified professionals. The cost of a subscription is typically far less than that of paying for one-to-one lessons from a tutor and allows you to learn at your own convenience on your own schedule. On YouTube, guitarists such as Rob Chapman and JustinGuitar have close to 500,000 subscribers each: 5 Types of Experts Who Could Make Extra Income Selling Videos Online  By using modern VOD (video-on-demand) platforms, music experts can create their own custom site to act as their online hub, with high-quality paid videos worthy of subscribers\u2019 money. Take, for example, the profitable subscription service HD Piano. With 800K Youtube subscribers it monetizing his videos of piano lessons\u00ad\u00adall without having any tangible products: 5 Reasons Why You Should Sell Your Videos Online One of the keys to HD Piano success was his choice of a freemium pricing model. Under this strategy, they would post YouTube videos of certain tutorial videos, which could be accessed for free, and then would offer customers access to more lessons for $60-\u00ada-\u00adyear subscription.  An advantage music experts have over some others is that learning and mastering an instrument is an ongoing process, so music tutorial sites will have a higher chance of seeing continuing memberships once that bond of trust and quality has been established. Here is a good practical example how it looks like for real video-on-demand channels: TMilly TV teaches people how to dance online It is an online dancing school which combines white-labeled premium VOD website with over 400 videos featuring dance, spearheading the new online trend of viral dance content which generated more than $30K in first four months after its launch. And they use free Youtube teasers to promote their paid VOD content instead of usual Youtube ads monetization:  ",

            "answer_text": "You can monetize the VIDEOS in your YouTube channel on your own, but not your SONGS and that\u2019s an important distinction. You know banner ads, video ads, ads that are skippable after the first 5 seconds, and ads that aren\u2019t. YouTube puts on its wizardly Google clothing and serves up the ads it thinks a particular viewer will be most responsive to based on that user\u2019s previous search, web-surfing, and viewing habits, their location, and lots of other creepy factors it\u2019s probably best not to think about. Anyway, companies pay YouTube for that targeted advertising reach sometimes paying per-click, sometimes paying per-impression, sometimes per view (for video ads) and YouTube shares some of this ad revenue with the content creator (the person who uploaded the video on which the advertisement is being run). In short, the way musicians earn money from YouTube is by allowing YouTube to place ads on the videos which feature their music. Much of what I\u2019ve said thus far is fairly common knowledge, at least amongst YouTube-savvy musicians. But here\u2019s something lots of musicians don\u2019t know: you can monetize ANY video on YouTube that uses your music, not just the videos in your channel and CD Baby helps you do it. When someone uses one of your songs in their crazy cat video, YouTube can ID your song, place an ad on the video, and direct a share of any ad revenue generated by the video to YOU. That\u2019s right: when someone else uses your music in one of their YouTube videos, they forfeit their ability to collect ad revenue for that video and it gets paid, instead, to you. Well, lots of people and the more folks that use your music in YouTube videos, the more money you\u2019ll make. ",
