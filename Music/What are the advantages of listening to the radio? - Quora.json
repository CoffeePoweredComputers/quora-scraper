            "answer_text": "What are the advantages of listening to the radio? Well, it\u2019s not very interesting to watch : ) But seriously, I am surprised at the question. Have you tried listening for yourself and see if there are parts of it which meet your needs? My answer to your question will be reflecting my needs since I don\u2019t know about you. And will be biased toward listening to broadcast stations. OK? Radio is a medium with a long history (as technical innovations go). Back around the time of the Great Depression an all-in-one receiver could be purchased for the home that was expensive, but not terribly. It ran off batteries (often several to provide the voltages needed for different stages). It might have a furniture-grade cabinet and be an enhancement to your home. The batteries had to be replaced, meaning a trip to town; rechargeable was not really a thing. As rural electrification came in radio receivers could use it, but even before radios made substantial penetration across homes in the US. Pretty soon stations began to up the programming quality. Commercials made it a business. Sponsors would pay for entire blocks of program, such as a romantic drama series which also shilled soap. So we began to schedule our evenings around what shows we wanted to spend our time with. I say we, but I was not born. Comedy, music, news, it was free media streaming with several choices. And at night, a select few longwave AM bands very allowed to use clear channels to cover much of the nation. So we have a mature system that will deliver entertainment and information in place. Stations were linked with communication technology between studios to share breaking news stories. So an advantage of listening to radio is that the broadcasters know what they are doing to meet the needs of a lot of people; chances are someone out there has put together a programming package that suits you. I did not grow up in a radio family, we watched TV. Summers, our community pool would play a top-40 station all day, so I was exposed to pop rock through the sixties on the summers (and through outdoor horns\u2026) But I sometimes play bass in oldies bands and the exposure to music I never would have heard at home at makes this easier. Unless the song was big in the winter! But my grandmother never had a TV, and listened to the radio in her kitchen a lot, mostly news programs. In fact, we bought her a new radio for the Watergate Hearings. (For her that would be like buying a new TV set for the Super Bowl). Learning to drive in the 1960\u2019s was for many of us a chance to control what was being listened to. Some of the cars even had FM reception, and album-oriented-rock was burgeoning on this part of the spectrum, which for technical reasons has improved sound. Finally it was time to think about upgrading cars to stereo and a few watts of power. You might even add a tape-player. Here begins though, and option from the radio to your own control. Today we can bring in our own tunes to play when we want, on a variety of storage devices. So I think the crux of your question as posed may be, why listen to radio when there is so much else? From a more global perspective, many countries offer government sponsored broadcasts. For those with less developed technical infrastructures, a battery radio (perhaps with a back-up hand-crank generator) can be supplied to every village and provide some entertainment, as well as information on basic health and nutrition, weather forecasts, news, with no commercials but perhaps some propaganda. But if you have learned to brush your teeth and wear shoes your life is already longer\u2026 And we can hear some of them with a relatively modest receiver. I worked as a broadcaster from 1973 through 1984, so I do have some bias toward listening to the radio. One thing radio can offer me today is a fairly wide choice of formats, so I can explore a bit. And when travelling by car I can find the seek button by feel and sample more variety, fighting terrain and coverage area, it is something that can be done safely and helps keep me alert. I use radio for background a lot. Driving, at work, in my shop, and laying in the pool. There are some programs on PBS I do work my schedule around and seriously listen to. I have worked in construction, and the saying was find out what stations the painters are listening to. They have to set it and not tune around all day, they are up on ladders a lot and their hands will leave marks. In the car I can play from a variety of devices (I even have a ham radio) but as much as I may like a bunch of favorites on a thumb drive, I have heard them all a lot and pretty soon I\u2019m scanning around. I should get bold and dip into the talk stations, I might learn something. many tend to share similar points of view, but there still should be some variety. When I listen to pop stations, I hear some new music. I don\u2019t download music, so this is a good way for me to learn - but computer automated stations often do not give the artists name! Smilin\u2019 Bert Nouvox (one of my airnames) felt that we had an obligation to the artists to get the word out on who they were. One or two of the stations I listen to in my new area use the capacity to send this info digitally and some of my radios will display artist name and song title. Less than a year ago we moved to South Carolina and I began learning what we have here. I work as a lamp repair technician in a high-end shop and started playing music from my collection of classical music on CD. But I only have so many, and had to carry in a new pile every day I went to work. It would not be appropriate for me to listen to talk, a customer in the shade section can hear what I am playing and some one can always find some thing to be offended by\u2026 So I kept tuning around and wonder of wonders found a little repeater that plays classical from a station in North Carolina. It\u2019s only 46 watts and I had to bring in a better antenna, I am five miles from it\u2026 but this is wonderful for me. I get to listen to good music, my hands are free for work, and this station does tell about what they are playing. (Since I have a degree in Classical Music History, this is of interest to me). Can\u2019t get them at home, but it\u2019s something. So, original poster, I have really told you why I listen to the radio. It\u2019s free, I have lots of devices that will work with it, there are choices for interest and mood, and I learn new stuff. If you want to always be in control, it may not be for you. I will note that most of the music stations tend to boost their bass to sound better on smaller radio receivers, and I have to re equalize my car head unit to reduce the boominess which would be sent to my subwoofer. And dynamic range might be reduced. Tune around. With luck you might still find a human-operated station running in real time. Songs will be better sequenced, that operator probably is really in to the music, and might share something about it. Old-school social media. After an accident where one of our cars was totaled in our driveway (and smashed into the house causing damage) I now have my first vehicle with Sirius built-in. Since this is a for-pay service, I can\u2019t say what it might do for me. If I had to spend more time driving, it might be of use. Is it still radio? I think so. If you did not grow up with radio, and instead are accustomed to having a personal playlist of thousands of songs in your pocket, the lack of control might be off-putting. But try letting someone else make the decisions for you, one less stress in your day. And you could be pleasantly surprised. Hope you enjoy! ",

            "answer_text": "I love radio, and this is why. It\u2019s live. Especially when you are listening to news, like on a public radio station, you are listening to someone who is talking right now about things happening today. There\u2019s something warm and wonderful - and these days, rare - about listening to something happening live. And it means that if something terrible or wonderful happens, you are right there listening as the host learns about it. My most vivid memory of this is turning on the radio on Sept. 11 after hearing from a friend that \u201ca small plane had crashed into some building\u201d and then hearing the horror in Bob Edward\u2019s voice as he started to understand the scope of the terror.You can hear things you don\u2019t expect. If all you do is listen to your Spotify playlist, or podcasts that you choose, you are curating your own experience and won\u2019t hear anything new. You can\u2019t choose what comes up on the radio, and that means you can be surprised.It\u2019s intimate. This is one person talking to another person. And if you listen to, say, local call in shows (like Brian Lehrer on WNYC), you really get the feeling that you are part of a community. People are calling in from the street, from cabs, from their homes, all because they care deeply about something. In a big city, it can help you feel connected to the otherwise anonymous people around you.",
