            "answer_text": "It\u2019s the fact that he seems to be so problematic. The collab happened because of one tweet of Puth, when he wrote \u201cjk\u201d. Obviously the army started to hint a collaboration because Jungkook was a huge fan of him, but Charlie didn\u2019t mean that, he was only saying \u201cjust kidding\u201d. Now, at that time Charlie was going to release a music video, and one or two days later he wrote another tweet saying \u201cJungkook look\u201d and the link of the music video. at this point the fans started to think that he only was doing that for attention and then some fans made tweets with all the problematic things that Charlie puth have done and said. the time passed and then the news that Jungkook and Charlie Puth were going to collab on an award show appeared and although some didn\u2019t like it they supported Jungkook because after all he was happy and liked his music. but yeah, basically it was the fact of all the problematic things he have done and the actions that he did to gain attention from the army.

Seriously if someone is disrespectful to the decisions of the celebrity they claim to admire better not call yourself an ARMY. A true ARMY has the right to like and dislike the collaboration but understand that they SHOULDN\u2019T be disrespectful against another singer. BTS never talk badly of their ARMY so act like a good mannered human being and don\u2019t try to harm Charlie Puth or any other singers In the end these disrespecful people do NOT have the business experience of Big Hit, BTS and Puth.
