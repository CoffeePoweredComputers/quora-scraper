You don\u2019t use someone for money and then automatically pretend they had nothing to do with their remix of your song hitting #1 on billboard? It\u2019s a kpop issue in the way that it shows that people really don\u2019t take kpop seriously enough that they don\u2019t feel the need to credit people. It\u2019s sad, but then again, Jason Derulo always seemed kinda clout hungry to me. ",
