            "answer_text": "Auto-tune has most commonly been used as a special effect, beginning with Cher\u2019s well known hit \u201cBelieve!\u201d, more than 20 years ago. Many singers have used Auto-tune as a creative device. However, according to an un-named Grammy-winning audio engineer, these days, Auto-tune is apparently used with almost all singing in popular music, to carefully and inconspicuously correct any notes that sound off-pitch. In other words, practically all of today\u2019s popular recorded music has been corrected by Auto-tune. The tool has evolved over the past twenty years (as has the processing power of the computing devices on which it runs) to the point of being able to do pitch correction seamlessly, naturally, automatically and correctly. When used as a special effect (as in Cher\u2019s \u201cBelieve\u201d), it is obvious and clear, but when it is used for its primary purpose, there is no way anyone can guess that the voice track has been auto-tuned. The Auto-tune as a special effect has been used to death and should be put to death. It has long outlived its novelty. However, its utility in the studio to correct stray pitch excursions is invaluable. Before the Auto-tune, an otherwise powerful, emotional performance needs to be re-recorded because a note or two during a long melisma sound off. Auto-tune gives the singer (and the producer) greater freedom to explore the perfomance without significantly worrying about nailing the pitch of every single note (and sacrificing the emotional charge in the process). It has probably the same significance, and value, in the recording studio, as did the invention of the multi-track recorder in the 60s. Before it, you had to get the entire band in the studio and have everyone play, without a single mistake, from beginning to end. Once multi-track came, you could first record some basic tracks (drums, bass, some scratch vocal track), then overdub other instruments, one by one, where you could easily stop, go back, punch in and record over each mistake, until each separate instrument is perfect. While this stop-and-go could easily break the concentration (and the flow of creative juices), it did allow for much cleaner, more precise and more tight (rhythmically) recordings. You could fix your mistakes by re-recording just the instrument and the passage that was bad. It was revolutionary, and the Auto-tune brought similar significant benefits to recording voice. \u201cStayin\u2019 Alive\u201d (Bee Gees\u2019 smash hit from the 70s) was recorded using a previously recorded drums (from \u201cMore Than a Woman\u201d). The regular drummer couldn\u2019t make it to the scheduled session. They took the best 4-bar segment (most steady and even) from \u201cMore Than a Woman\u201d, which was recorded some time earlier, looped the recording and laid it down on its own separate tracks for the new song. They then overdubbed other instruments and voices. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a two part answer really. The first part borrows a little from the world of computer graphics. The Uncanny Valley. This is the phenomenon wherein the more lifelike a simulated human person becomes, the more unbelievable they become. In a way the minute \u2018subconscious\u2019 errors are more obvious than the large, \u2018impressionist\u2019 or cartoonish ones.  Andy OMFGwhathappenedtyourfacesomeonecallthecops?! Sirkis. When you pitch correct someone\u2019s voice, you\u2019re not just changing the pitch of one note but the transition to the notes before and after it. You also make subtle changes to the formant (the face/sinus sound) of the performance. Imagine someone is singing to you and for a split second their face slightly deforms to sing a note! That\u2019s basically what happens with pitch correct. It\u2019s fleetingly small a change but it\u2019s so very unnatural that it stands out for a mile. The solution to this of course is to not actually engage the pitch correct except very occasionally. Which is what the majority of producers do\u2026 Because the second part is the obvious answer - is it really though? As someone who does this sort of thing for a job I can assure you that pitch-correct (not auto-tune in the T-Pain/Cher sense) is something that actually gets used less than you might imagine. Most of the time, budget allowing a producer will go for better takes over \u2018post edits\u2019. I actually often have to discard unedited takes for sounding too auto-tuned. No kidding. ",
