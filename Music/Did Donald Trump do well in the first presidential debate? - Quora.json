            "answer_text": "There are people answer questions on here subjectively, and those who answer them objectively. If you answer the above subjectively then you would think Trump did poorly. You might even call him a \u201cpetulant child.\u201d But here is the fact: Trump got on that stage knowing he was debating not just Biden but also Chris Wallace. Chris\u2019s dad, Mike Wallace was a flaming liberal and Chris, although he works for fox news felt he had to assume the role of Biden\u2019s \u201cprotector.\u201d That is inappropriate for a moderator, but inappropriate behavior from moderators is pretty much the norm at these things! As a result, Trump was a steamroller. He fought them both to solid effect. Now if you don\u2019t like Trump, last night didn\u2019t change your opinion of him. In fact it probably confirmed it. However, Trump supporters are among the most loyal of supporters and they rejoiced at the tactic. Trumps goal was to frustrate Biden, get under his skin, defend his record, and attack Bidens son Hunter for huge corruption payments from Oligarchs the main stream media refuses to cover. But after the debate, people are doing internet searches about Hunter and learning the truth. Trump did what he was been doing since he came down the escalator in 2015. He battled. He battled the deep state when they tried to spy on his campaign. He battled the one sided Mueller probe. He battled ISIS and defeated them. He battled the main stream media as they attacked him with phony debunked stories over his first term. He battled crooked generals that were in the pocket of the military industrial complex. He battled allies to get better trade deals and stem the flow of illegal immigration that were coming here as caravans. Biden\u2019s job was to memorize \u201cgotcha\u201c one liners and Trump frustrated his attempts to \u201cplay\u201d them. One of his best forced errors was when Biden couldn\u2019t remember how many people died from Covid, finally settle on 200,000 deaths and then asked how many of those survived? Uh, Joe, people don\u2019t usually survive death! Why didn\u2019t anyone on his staff mention that to him? I watched the whole debate start to finish, and Biden looked frustrated and angry. Naturally the media will spin the night as an epic Biden victory, but don\u2019t expect Biden to take any tough questions because he has to recover from the effects of the Trump buzzsaw he faced last night! Here is what Trump got Biden to admit: Biden does not support the green new dealBiden does not support the Bernie Sanders AOC manifestoBiden thinks Antifa is just and ideaBiden lied profusely about Hunter Biden and his payments from foreign oligarchsBiden would not answer whether he would support packing the Supreme courtBiden wants to increase federal corporate tax to 28%, 1/3 higher than it is now (a definite job killer after covid)For a guy who has been hiding in his basement, reading only prepared dialogue, these were some pretty big accomplishments. Meanwhile he got Biden so frustrated he called the president a clown, a liar and a racist. Trump also hit Bidens troubled past with racism calling blacks \u201csuper predators,\u201d and being for busing. Subjectively, Biden won the debate as he looks like the victim and Wallace had to protect him. But that opens the question of whether we want a president that needs to be defended or one that can defend the entire country? Objectively however, Biden accomplished little to hurt Trumps support, but Trump peeled off some of the groups Biden is counting on like Bernie supporters, moderates that don\u2019t want court packing and Wall street. Objectively, Trump accomplished far more from the debate. I give Trump a A for strategy, an A- for effect and a C+ for style. I expect the style grade to improve with the other two debates. ",

            "answer_text": "Full disclosure: I vigorously oppose Trump in the 2020 election and I support Joe Biden. My theory of the case going into the September 29, 2020 debate is the same as it is leaving the debate. I had already made up my mind about how I would vote, and I had already made up my mind about what to expect from the debate. Here is some informal discussion of my thought process. While I am not \u201cobjective\u201d in so far as I DO have a dog in the fight, I\u2019m going to be as objective as possible in my analysis. The debate was pretty awful and I think the most important, and perhaps only, takeaway is that Biden didn\u2019t buckle. He got flustered at times, did his share of interrupting, and was evasive on some key questions. But the point of the president going Full Trump, as Dan puts it below, was to make Biden crack and it didn\u2019t happen. So Trump turned in a performance that a lot of viewers will find unpresidential without getting the upside. I doubt the debate will change the race much one way or the other, but Biden benefits every day the trajectory of the race stays the same. \u2014Rich Lowry, editor-in-chief of the National Review, \u201cWell, That Was Dispiriting,\u201d September 30, 2020 My theory of the case going into the 9/29/20 debate was that the debate was about Joe Biden. Biden is polling well. He has had stable poll numbers. Donald Trump is very unpopular overall. And Trump\u2019s lack of popularity has been very stable. He has supporters that love him but nobody else likes him much. Biden has run a defensive, don\u2019t-rock-the-boat type of campaign. The plan has been to keep attention off of Biden and onto Trump. Trump can\u2019t win a referendum on Trump. It follows from this that, going into the debate, the debate being about Joe Biden is a negative for Joe Biden. Anything that distracts from the \u201cI\u2019m not that guy\u201d message is potentially a problem for Joe. However, I was cautiously optimistic. Team Trump had lowered expectations incredibly low for Joe. From Team Trump, over the past few months, we\u2019ve heard: \u201cBiden can\u2019t piece two sentences together. Nobody with dementia can debate against Trump and win\u201d[1]\u201cTrump will thrash Biden so hard, Biden won\u2019t even want to leave his basement to show up for the debate\u201d[2]\u201cThe Biden campaign is elder abuse\u201d[3]These memes circulating on right-wing social media told me three things. FIRST, Team Trump expects this debate to go well for Trump (if Biden is man enough to show up). SECOND, the Team Trump is INVESTED in this debate going well for Trump. Team Trump is immovable and WILL vote for him, but they are still capable of disappointment. THIRD, Team Trump set the expectations really low for Biden by circulating these memes.[4] All Biden needs to do to meet expectations is show up and put two sentences together. My theory of the case has been that the first debate is a test of Team Trump\u2019s theory that Biden\u2019s alleged senescence makes him unviable as a candidate. It also seemed fairly obvious that Trump would be super-aggressive, in order to fish for bad gaffes or 30-second clips to circulate on social media where Biden seems not to know what is going on. Trump was going to be super-aggressive to Biden to see how well they can portray Biden as an old man who doesn\u2019t know how to tie his shoelaces. The secondary component of my theory of the case has been that Team Trump\u2019s other main focus is the \u201cradical left\u201d pigeonhole. The familiar refrain from Trump supporters has been: 1) \u201cSleepy Joe is low IQ, can\u2019t leave his basement, and is no match for Trump because he has dementia and can\u2019t piece two sentences together\u201d;[5] and 2) \u201cJoe Biden is a Trojan Horse for the radical left.\u201d[6] The \u201cSleepy Joe won\u2019t leave his basement\u201d refrain is most popular amongst the \u201cTrump base\u201d. \u201cBiden will be dominated by the radical left\u201d is most popular amongst the \u201cRepublican base.\u201d In addition to testing the base\u2019s theory that Biden can\u2019t debate Trump, my other thought is that the debate would be a test of how well Trump could pigeonhole Biden as a Trojan Horse for the radical left. Overall, I expected Biden to exceed the low expectations Trump had set for him. If you asked me for a sitrep before the debate, all of the above is what I would have told you about the state of play. My theory of the case proved correct. What I did not expect, and what I was frankly shocked by, were the extremes to which Donald Trump went to try to prove up his \u201cSleepy Joe can\u2019t debate Trump\u201d theory. I did not expect Donald Trump to be willing to GO SO LOW to razz Biden or throw Biden off his game. Trump\u2019s hope was to generate some 30-second clips that showed either bad gaffes or Biden babbling nonsensically. Trump didn\u2019t really get any of those clips THAT I SAW. But Trump went REALLY, REALLY FAR to try to get them. And the lasting impression is one of the worst debates ever. There was no excuse for the things that I saw. I have been known to engage in a little bit of \u201cbothsidesism\u201d from time to time, but this is NOT an occasion for \u201cbothsidesism.\u201d Trump came across like a kingpin douchebag the likes of which I have never seen before. Trump coming across like this shouldn\u2019t shock anyone in 2020. However, I was unprepared for the sheer, unadulterated, overwhelming intensity of the douchebaggery. I didn\u2019t think such a thing was possible, but it WAS. Would we be shocked anymore if Trump urinated on Joe Biden\u2019s shoe at the next debate? Speaking of \u201cbothsidesism,\u201d deflecting the heat off Trump by complaining about the moderator is DAFT. The entire point of Trump doing what he did was to cause chaos and not let Biden get situated. Trump wasn\u2019t going to let the moderator moderate. Trump wasn\u2019t controllable. That was the point. It was deliberate, not an accident. If they had a mute on the microphone Trump would\u2019ve shouted loud enough we could hear him in Biden\u2019s mic. He was ALL IN on throwing off Biden. He failed spectacularly. As far as the radical left pigeonhole is concerned, the notable moments for the Republican base that I saw were: Biden not answering the question about court-packing (and he shouldn\u2019t because the hearing on Barrett hasn\u2019t happened yet\u2026 and that\u2019s not all. I would have to write a stand-alone answer on why); andBiden not being able to name a police organization that supports him (even though there are over 100 that do and hundreds more generals).Biden saying \u201cANTIFA is an idea not an organization.\u201d\u201c3\u201d is pretty grievous I will be honest with you. Democrats need to stop making this mistake on this issue. But it is a drop in the bucket compared to the sins on the opposing side. I also thought Trump confirming he wants to push through a nominee for the SCOTUS to help him in the election was very bad for him. It may be what the Republican base wants to believe but I don\u2019t think they want Trump to SAY it.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not going to bother talking about Biden aside from saying the following: Meh. He\u2019s doing as well as you can against such an opponent. I\u2019d say more, but you didn\u2019t ask. I\u2019m also not going to debate how Trump did for other people. We can look at polls, but I think our last election proved to us just how useful polls are when it comes to Trump. I can only say how he did as far as I\u2019m concerned. I\u2019m going to be honest\u2026 I\u2019m not excited about Biden. I\u2019m even less excited about his running mate. For me, it was never a question of voting for Trump but rather if I\u2019d vote for Biden against Trump. My alternative is to cast my vote for a third party. Before the debate, I would say I was somewhat leaning towards Biden. After the debate, I am far more in favor of voting for Biden because of how poorly Trump carried himself, how poorly he debated, and how poorly he apparently has planned a future for our country. The only thing I agreed with Trump on was his statement that \u201cElections have consequences.\u201d I fault the Democratic Party for setting Trump up to win by having such a poor selection of candidates in the last election. It looked like they were going to repeat it this time\u2026 and they largely have. While I don\u2019t think Clinton was \u201ccrooked\u201d and certainly found her qualified (much more so than Trump), I knew that she would perform poorly against even a hatemonger buffoon like Trump because she just isn\u2019t popular. Elections have consequences. The Democrats lost. The Republicans now have free reign to choose a third Supreme Court Justice. Aside from that? Trump was a petulant child. He went ad hominem over and over again, even calling out Biden\u2019s son. Meanwhile, Biden didn\u2019t bring up Trump\u2019s family having\u2026 communications with the Russians. He constantly talked over everyone, almost like he was afraid of someone saying something that would hurt him. He was afraid of losing momentum\u2026 or possibly afraid of giving people a moment to think. Trump regularly said things that weren't true. We already know about his taxes. We already know he said things about white supremacists. We know Conway said what she said. We know Biden didn\u2019t say \u201cSuperpredators\u201d (again, that was Clinton)\u2026 though he did say \u201cPredators.\u201d Do I need to talk about his plans? His lack of a plan for medical? His lack of a plan for COVID aside from continuing to not believe in science? Did anyone notice how he said that he didn\u2019t believe his own scientist and then interrupted himself to say that his scientist never even said \u201cthat?\u201d So here\u2019s the bottom line\u2026 I have major issues with liars and people who try to con me. That\u2019s everything that Trump did. Thus, my \u201cnonvote\u201d is much more likely to become a vote for Biden. The big takeaway for me? Trump wasn't specific about anything. He continually trumpeted about his own record\u2026 which basically made him sound like this: \u201cI have done more for this country by saying I\u2019ve done more for this country than any president in history.\u201d Yes. I reread that and meant it exactly as it sounded. Saying you\u2019ve been awesome isn\u2019t the same thing as being awesome. ",

            "answer_text": "Trump showed his willingness to lie, break the rules and manipulate to get what he wants. He broke the rules so much Chris Wallace needed to intervene multiple times to try to get him back on track. Even with that Wallace wasn\u2019t entirely successful. He also celebrated a white-supremacist, Nazi, racist far-right group and told them to \u201cstand by.\u201d Offered an opportunity to condemn white supremacists, he declined and then explicitly celebrated them instead. Trump didn\u2019t really argue. He just slung insults and disconnected vitriol. He also lied about how he is in court now to defund the ACA, how he has no plans to replace it with any relevant plan of his own, and how he wants to take care away from people with pre-existing conditions. He said, facetiously, that he intended his dead-serious (literally) recommendation of bleach for coronavirus sarcastically, when everyone knows this is false. (Even if it were true it would not be exculpatory, since everyone took it seriously at the time, and a president\u2019s job is to be a good communicator.) He lied about the pandemic by stating that it only affects the elderly but never children or young people. He continue to advance the false argument of a dichotomous relationship between the economy and public health. In reality his administration has been disastrous for both. While Biden led the jobs recovery act which saved so many jobs all across the country and contributed to ending the recession, supports farmers, public lands and the environment, is a strong supporter of diplomacy of free trade and has detailed plans to empower small business-owners, Trump has nothing of the sort. His trade wars have been economically disastrous, like his massive failures regarding public health. But, it benefits him to advance the argument that health and the economy are opposed: in reality, measures benefitting public health would save lives, restore trust and enable us to gradually reopen: the not only best but only way to TRULY save the economy. In short, he did terribly. His failure to condemn, and deliberate decision to publicly and proudly celebrate, white supremacy and far-right violence, not to mention domestic terror, will go down in history as one of the worst stains on our history and our nation. Trump is the reason it\u2019s embarrassing, at times humiliating, to be an American abroad when it used to be empowering. He sure showed that tonight! Trump even bullied Chris Wallace, as well as Biden, with his hate, lies and vitriol. The man is truly incapable of rational thought, or even pretending to a semblance of rationality or indeed humanity as such. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, the very next day following the debate included celebrations among white supremacists across the country. Thanks to Trump. That\u2019s how he did. That\u2019s all anyone should need to know. For context, Trump didn\u2019t say he condemns white supremacy when he was asked. He was asked to condemn Proud Boys, a white supremacist group, and instead of doing so he told them to stand back and stand by. That was his comment. Again, that\u2019s all anyone should need to know. My only other complaint besides all the interrupting is that Trump didn\u2019t talk about any of his plans to revive the economy, unify the country, reform policing and justice, fix healthcare, and fight COVID. He hasn\u2019t talked about his plans during his campaigning from that I\u2019ve noticed and seen. I expected the debate to be policy heavy. Biden talked about his plans to invest $2 trillion in infrastructure and clean energy, and his plans to create new manufacturing and innovative jobs. Biden has detailed his plans online and at campaign events, and he went over some policy during the debate. Trump didn\u2019t though. He didn\u2019t talk about any plans. All Trump said about healthcare is that he has a plan and that he will release it soon. He\u2019s been saying that for months. He didn\u2019t talk about his plans to safely open businesses, schools and the economy. He didn\u2019t talk about his plans to fight COVID and help our economy. Trump had plenty to say - so much so that he talked over others - and yet what he had to say wasn\u2019t even about how he will help us and our country. Nothing. That\u2019s very problematic. He doesn\u2019t seem to have an actual platform. That\u2019s how it went. ",

            "answer_text": "Reading answers from other users, I feel like I was watching an entirely different debate... There's no doubt that Trump interrupted Biden and the moderator on numerous occasions but that should never have happened. The mics should have been muted to allow each speaker their time to debate. Blaming Trump for speaking out of turn is synonymous with blaming a child for eating candy before dinner. The parents should not let the child have access to candy just as the moderator should have not allowed Trump the ability to speak out of turn. While some of his remarks were humorous, I think he overdid himself on many occasions and should have allowed Biden his time. I think he hurt himself towards undecided voters because he was allowing himself to be antagonized by Biden's statements. It's also no surprise that his behavior appears to have reinforced decided voters since the majority of answers from this question do not encourage an open discussion. I think Trump made excellent points in regards to the questions he was asked. A fair amount of what he said was able to be fact-checked, while some other things, not so much or actually false. I think Biden did an excellent job as Trump said he would since he has much more experience on the political stage than Trump. Biden knew how to speak, connect with the audience, and convey his points while expressing his views. However, I don't feel like Biden said anything other than what we've been hearing for the last few years. Many of the old debunked talking points of the left were dragged out against Trump as a final battle cry. Biden contradicted himself on many occasions, especially in regards to the way COVID-19 was handled and I was a bit disappointed because Trump's counterarguments are easily verifiable and have been for quite some time. I don't think Biden was able to dynamically talk about the subjects like Trump could. It was obvious that he needed his notes and yet Trump didn't appear to have any. Even though Trump rambled many times, he was still able to express the things he needed to say without the use of a card. Biden was rather stumped when pressed by Trump to say that he supported law and order. He had no real argument other than calling Trump a racist, which at this point is the go-to catchphrase of the left. It's obvious that talking well of policing agencies would upset some of his supporters. The Democrats are focused on defunding the police and ICE, as well as enabling or perhaps even encouraging the rioting and looting to continue in cities across America. Trump would easily have been able to point out his obviously contradictory view if he hadn't shifted the discussion to race. Trump impressed me with his knowledge about Biden's past and was able to interject with reasonable counterarguments. Biden was also not quite what the media made him out to be. He appeared to hold himself together and could speak about his topics when Trump wasn't interrupting him. I think it's clear that Trump won the debate in terms of defending his administration's accomplishments. A fair amount of what his administration has done is verifiable and I think he should be given credit for those things. However, Biden did a significantly better job of keeping his cool and presented himself to be a mature and more \"presidential\" candidate. He did lose composure from time to time but I think that it's understandable considering how distracting and antagonizing Trump's behavior can be. I'm a little bit disappointed with most of the top writers' answers about the debate. I expected much more thoughtful answers but I do realize that the most popular answers are usually for entertainment purposes and not meant for meaningful discussions. I do think most of what I read only reinforces how difficult it is to be a supporter of Trump and how blind many people are to their overwhelmingly obvious bigotry. I know the internet is a sample of the population and shouldn't be used to make sweeping generalizations but it is incredibly difficult to have a respectful conversation on the internet. At the risk of not losing my time arguing with people who usually resort to slander me, I am going to choose not to answer comments. ",

            "answer_text": "I got to watch this one because someone died at my workplace and work was canceled that night for me. In my opinion the entire debate was disgusting and a total joke. I remembered watching the Carter/Reagan debates in 1980 as a child and it was no comparison. I will answer this based on my own opinion as a swing voter who\u2019s more of a left-of-center type liberal, not a progressive. Trump was wrong about having the best economy. It was still a good one, but he already inherited record job growth, which actually went down under him. The economy was also better under a few other administrations in the past. Biden was wrong when he claimed that Trump would be the only President that would leave office with less jobs being created than when he entered. This also happened under W Bush after his first term. Trump danced around the question about anthropogenic climate change, and instead explained how to deal with its aftermath while not even acknowledging the science behind it. As far as white supremacists are concerned, I kind of felt it was a trap question because are the latter more numerous today than in the past? He also made a good point about how it\u2019s mostly the Left causing the damages, violence and looting. Biden did acknowledge that, but I think he failed to reassure those people facing this chaos daily that he\u2019d crack down on it. In my opinion the debate probably did not matter for Trump as much as it did for Biden because many Trump supporters will support him no matter what, and he knows this. Biden also has people who will support him no matter what, but he\u2019s not the incumbent. The real question is what do swing voters such as myself think. To be honest, I\u2019m not sure. My opinion is this, the progressive agenda is destroying the Democratic Party, and even the \u2018moderates\u2019 have embraced many of its poisonous facets. Tulsi Gabbard is probably one of the few true moderates (by moderate I mean those who do not adhere to intersectionality and critical theories, not someone who thinks that pot should stay illegal). And of course the science denialism of Republicans have already been destroying them for a while. Thsee factors above came out during the debate. ",

            "answer_text": "Donald Trump showed that he is definitely a BULLY. He kept interrupting Biden, and the Moderator. He spewed lies as usual. Badger-Badger-Badger! Trump kept insisting on doing the speaking - during Biden\u2019s turns too, and was even fighting with the Moderator! Ever speak to someone who asks you a question, then as you start to answer, jumps on you after you\u2019ve said 3 words, and presses you on something else tangential, and insists on hogging the whole conversation, running right over you? You can\u2019t get a word in edgewise! Certainly no civil discourse. Those are Bullies! That\u2019s what Trump did. Kudos to Biden for not putting up with it. I feel bad for Joe, having to fend off someone who acts like that. Yes, he interrupted a bit too - to fend off the lies, but didn\u2019t interrupt nearly as much as Trump did. Biden rightly referred to Trump as a clown, and given how much Trump interrupted, I feel he was justified in telling Trump to shut up from time to time. He had to, to rein in that rudeness! It\u2019s about time someone stood up to Trump. Trump fans will love Trump\u2019s performance. Anyone who believes in civility, logic, calm, and seriousness when it comes to government would be appalled by Trump\u2019s performance. Trivia Note: Joe Biden, as a child, was an awful stutterer! People may jump on him today for his speech, but this man has overcome debilitating stuttering! So it\u2019s more than unfair to pick on how much effort it takes to form his words - nor does that have anything to do with intelligence. I could go on, but that\u2019s the crux of it. This is about how Trump did in the debate, not the list I could make about him in general. His performance was dividing, gut-churning to watch, and a number of people have called into news channels reporting that their children either went into rage fits or burst into tears. So much for Trump being a wonderful example for this country. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that the answer to this can be pretty well summed up by the following actual quote of his, when asked by Lester Holt about his initial, documented support for the Iraq war and his current claim that he never supported it: \u201cWhen I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anybody's asked me, I said who knows. Essentially, I then did an interview Neil Cavuto. I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox, and he called me the other day and I spoke to him about it. He said you were totally, because he was for the war ... And that is before the war started. Sean Hannity said very strongly, to me and other people, he's willing to say, but nobody wants to call him, I was against the war. He said you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war. And I understand that side also. Not very much, because we should have never been there, but nobody called Sean Hannity. And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started. I think in '04. But they did an article, which had me totally against the War in Iraq. And one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, trump was, because if you read this article, there's no doubt. But if somebody, and I'll ask the press, if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started. He and I used to have arguments about the war. I said it's a terrible and a stupid thing. It's going to destabilize the Middle East. And that exactly what this's done.\u201d All presidents, and basically all world leaders, look to leave behind their words and excerpts from their famous speeches. All presidents and world leaders need to engage in diplomacy, where being articulate and thoughtful are virtues of the highest order. Donald Trump cannot possibly have imagined that this topic wouldn\u2019t come up (though if otherwise, that\u2019s its own serious concern about his judgment), and the above is the sum total of his capacity for eloquence, even with plenty of opportunity for preparation.

He wanted to be the loud and blustery Trump who so energised the people who thought his \u201canti-PC\u201d act was refreshing, but he was also trying to look like he had a Presidential Temperament, which polling suggests is costing him with undecided voters. In the end he looked a lot like he did both badly. He had some abusive and shouty moments but also looked a bit weak on some of his key areas. He failed to land any blows on Clinton but faltered badly when she landed blows on him. His handling of some of his problem areas (tax returns, support for Iraq war, being wealthy and priveliged) weren\u2019t handled well and helped raise the issue rather than knock them down. He also looked like the less healthy of the two candidates, which was ironic. Crucially he will fare much worse out of the post debate fact checks. People will be dissecting the debate throroughly and there were lots of his statements that won\u2019t hold up to fact checking, that always looks bad. I wouldn\u2019t call it a huge win for Clinton, she still didn\u2019t come across as someone who wanted to serve, she looked like someone who wanted power, but she fared better than Trump. He\u2019s always had a problem with the truth and with the public perception of his temperament. The debate served to highlight both problems. ",

            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t call that a debate at all. I\u2019d call that a train wreck. But that is also basically where this country is right now with our government and the political divide that we currently find ourselves. We are at each other\u2019s necks. Trump is not a politician nor a debater. He\u2019s a results oriented businessman. He\u2019s got no patience for those who disagree with him and that clearly showed tonight. Most Republicans will probably be ok with Trump\u2019s performance even if it was hard to watch and somewhat cringeworthy. But debates are for reaching those undecided, middle ground voters. And Trump\u2019s lack of poise and cool definitely hurt his chances with those voters. As for Biden, he mostly did what he needed to do but he did get rattled a few times by Trump. He made a few small gaffes but I saw nothing major wrong with his performance. Biden is a career politician with a lot of experience debating. He\u2019s a seasoned veteran as some would say. We will see what his changing stance is on now being against the Green New Deal will do for him after this debate since he has been for it previously. His on screen appeal was probably good for some undecideds but not sure he can convince them his plans are going to work better than Trump\u2019s. As for the moderator Chris Wallace, he had no control at all. At times with his yelling over the other two yelling it was ridiculous and hard to watch. I couldn\u2019t understand anybody at times. If the other debates are going to be more of the same, count me out. ",

            "answer_text": "Trump was completely incoherent throughout. If you\u2019ve been following the campaign closely, as I have, then you\u2019d know what he was trying to say (which is usually something fairly stupid to start with), but for a previously-unengaged voter tuning in for their first glimpse of the candidates, it would be just about impossible to understand Trump. At one podium was an angry guy going on and on about who knows what - China, Japan, Sid Blumenthal (who?), Sean Hannity; and at the other podium was a poised and well-prepared woman who spoke in sentences and paragraphs and occasionally laughed at Donald\u2019s nonsense. And he was rude. At the start, he omitted the customary thanks-to-our-hosts comment. He was sniffing very loudly - obviously some current health issue. He interjected loudly, frequently, and pointlessly. He argued with the moderator. He pretty much admitted that he doesn\u2019t pay federal taxes. He went on and on about how he should get great credit for that one non-racist golf club he built. His defense against racist actions in the 1970s - lots of people got sued as well, and there was no admission of guilt. He\u2019s got nothing. No specifics. No facts. It\u2019s obvious he didn\u2019t do any normal debate prep. And if he can\u2019t be bothered to, or isn\u2019t capable of, preparing for one 90-minute debate, it\u2019s also obvious that if he\u2019s elected (God forbid) then he would be equally unprepared to do that very demanding job. So someone else would be doing the actual work and taking the decisions. Who would that be ? Heck if I know. Maybe Omarosa. Worst. Candidate. Ever. ",

It was hilarious to hear the Fox news spin on the disaster of debate one. For example, \u201che showed strong leadership\u201d. True - the moderator couldn\u2019t get him to follow the rules that he had apparently already agreed to. He seems to make things up as he goes along, that sound good to him, and then because he said it then it has to be true. After all, he\u2019s the president. He seems to believe what he says, regardless of the truth. Those that don\u2019t fact check trump's statement will think he was brilliant. During his term he has actually achieved some of the things he set out to do. But he has failed miserably on the majority. And lies about his non-accomplishments. Those that support trump and think he is brilliant BELIEVE it to be so. Challenging this worldview (even with facts) just reinforces their worldview and there is little one can do to change it. According to How Popular Is Donald Trump? his approval rating is above 42%. Doesn\u2019t say much for almost half the population of the USA. ",

Then the CNN commentators came on and were gushing about how much better Trump was in this debate than the first one. I couldn't believe they were watching the same debate. Trump threatened to appoint a special prosecutor to throw Clinton in jail. Isn't that what they do in 3rd world banana republics? Throw political opponents in jail after the elections. He had Martha Radditz exasperated when he was unable to answer a question about Aleppo and talked about Mosul instead. Like the last debate he got less coherent as time went on. He was constantly interrupting Hillary Clinton's answers which were far more substantive than his. People are complaining that both candidates are unfit,but I am sick and tired of these false equivalencies. There is one candidate who understands the issues and has actual policies. The other babbles incoherently and cannot stay on topic. I actually felt sympathy for Hillary. It was literally like debating a chimpanzee. Ed. Note: I miss read the question and was commenting on the second debate. ",

If you define it by convincing people who weren\u2019t already on his side (either Biden voters or undecided)\u2026 no, he didn\u2019t do well. No one who was going to vote for Biden would be changed by that and if anything the undecided voters looked at that and made the decision in favour of the guy who looked presidential instead of the guy who looked like he belonged on the corner while yelling at cars.

To say he phoned it in is an insult to anyone who has ever prepped for a conference call. He didn\u2019t think he needed to prepare, so he didn\u2019t. Preparation and study are an admission that you don\u2019t know everything already. Hillary acknowledges this as a fact of life; Trump can\u2019t admit he doesn\u2019t know something because that would open the door to the kind of self-knowledge he has devoted his entire life to avoiding. I think this lamentable performance will really hurt him. His supporters are willing to forgive him a lot, but most of them still value hard work and competence. They don\u2019t admire the quarterback who trains so poorly for the big game that he gets winded in the first quarter; nor the hunter who brags about his marksmanship but couldn\u2019t hit a bull in the ass with a bass fiddle. Hopefully that portion of the population who realizes you can\u2019t bluster and bullshit your way through every life challenge might be having second thoughts about him. ",

If it truly were any kind of competition, then it would be those of us who watched the incident who were shown to be the losers. And the winners would clearly be those people who found a better way to spend their time- and, sadly, that would probably include pretty much anything else that they decided to do- at least if it were both moral and somehow contributed something positive to the common good. To paraphrase an early Adam Sandler movie- I think maybe Billy Madison?- we are all a little bit dumber for having watched the debate last night than we would have been if we had not watched it. And, sadly, our decision to watch it in the first place means that most of us were already a little dumb to begin with\u2026 so there\u2019s that.

Trump did well but could have done a better job of managing his time and staying on subject. He controlled the debate like a boss, had a better command of the facts and prevented the moderator from helping Biden too much. Trump did a grest job of pointing out that Biden had 47 years in public office and nothing good to show for it, pointed out that he was losing the left, pointed out that not a single law enforcement agency or union has endorced him and pointed to his history of corruption. Biden made a lot of outrageous and false statements, made numerous minor gaffes and speech mumbles and started running out of energy about 30 minutes in. Biden tried to go after Trump on Covid, but failed miserably when Trump pointed out the Biden actually was against the President's early action and kept falling back on 'he has no plan \u2018 or ad-hominem. Biden also refused to answer the question about packing the SCOTUS and lost his cool when pressed. When Hunter's questionable windfalls were brought up, Biden just tried to deny it. ",

I could not tell you what Biden stands for. I can not tell you any of Biden polcieis. I can tell you who is againt Trump. but that is about it By deffination Trump won. He brought poitns into a conversation Biden countered those points but never really made any of his own he kept attacking Trump. Biden also had a few gaffs which well does not help him and he never corrected those gaffs unlike trump. Maybe I missed something being English as a second language. Trumps victory however is not enough to really say anything. Its like winning first place in a race\u2026 of two people. And the other guy did not bother to run and critized your running form. ",

Not necessary lazy just dont care too. They have modest lives and, are comfortable the way they live. Stock Market historically high better than ever been. Employers couldn't find enough people to fill the demand of jobs open. The largest supplier of energy. World wide. Then the coved hit. I have no concern that, President Trump will again, bring us back to that unequaled economy. Our Military is at its best, theres no county with a better equipped Military than the united States. Zero None. The Democratic\u2019s will distory this county as, we know it today. There idea, of running this, country with, free everything for everyone, free schools for everyone Free healthcare for the entire world. Because, we will have no borders. People can come an go as they please. People get sick just cross the border its free in America. You don't need to pay anything. The working saps in America pay the bill for you, ya, (they are stupid) but its free for us. Ya, lets go plus, they pay you as well. Yes a paycheck for not working. And the best is when you get old and can't do anything the money just keeps on coming. Yes, still comes from the poor saps that work. Here\u2019s the key. The ones that work the Government takes almost 70% of there paycheck and, they can't do a thing about it. Plus, they Voted for this, all this free stuff for everyone. Ok question, what happens when the Money runs out. Who cares its not my Money I'm not even suppose to be in this, county. The Government stole it from all the working people. So, Vote for the Democratic nearest you, your kids & Grandkids will will hate you forever. Wake up people nothing, is free nothing ",

Biden could have done better, but given the constant interruption, I was quite surprised that he didn\u2019t end up losing his marbles. 90-mins of that kind of interruption would have given me a pounding headache and made me irritable, to say the least. His low point was calling Trump a clown. He shouldn\u2019t have done that. All in all, Unfortunate for the USA, is all I would say. ",

I am not a construction manager or architect, but a businessman. I just know how to get it done by hiring the right people. Check out the results of my work. If elected, I will approach Presidency in similar way. I will hire great professionals that would execute my ideas.\"2. \" Some of my businesses did fail. That an indication of my honesty. Corrupted businesses, AKA oligarchies, never fail.\" Something of that sort will get him back on track and first debate will be forgotten. ",

If it was anyone else, it would be considered an unmitigated disaster, but for the trump cultists, it was business as usual Biden wasn\u2019t the most impressive speaker ever, but mainly managed to speak reasonably and clearly, despite the constant interruptions. If he did mis-speak i.e. Medicare /Medicaid, I saw him pick up on it and correct it . Biden more than exceeded the very low expectations set for him by trump, and didn\u2019t embarrass himself. By any reasonable measure, trump lost badly- but I don\u2019t think that matters to anyone who was planning to vote for him. For the others, turn the microphone off when it isn\u2019t that speakers turn. It might help. ",

I give Joe Biden credit for not rolling his eyes up in his head. He had to stoop to near the low of Trump\u2019s level\u2014he did repeatedly tell Trump to \u2018shut up\u2019 for speaking out of turn\u2014but he had to. You can\u2019t take the \u2018high road\u2019 and sound lofty and erudite while your debate partner deals in slime and wallows in the garbage. Joe wasn\u2019t afraid to jump right into that dung heap and kick Trump\u2019s ass, hand it to him on a platter, then hop out and answer the moderator\u2019s questions. No more debates, please. We know now that Biden isn\u2019t sleepy, that Trump is a moron, that the coronavirus pandemic needs attention from the White House instead of debate prep. Or, Trump could simply step down and concede the election now, and let Pence finish out his term. ",

Nice to see the leader of the free world trying to attack his opponent\u2019s children instead of talking about policy\u2026but then I suspect he doesn\u2019t have much in the way of policy. Trump was telling the same old lies and threats. He comported himself in his usual fashion. Like a 3 year old with a full diaper in desperate need of a nap shouting ME ME ME! Here we are in America with a President essentially saying that he wants to invalidate the election if he loses. That isn\u2019t the America I was born and raised in. ",

Before the debate, 56% of people thought Biden would win, 43% thought Trump would.  The same group after the debate thought Biden won. Only 28% of that group think Trump did. Most people thought Biden was attacking fairly.  Most people thought Trump was\u2026 not.  Bottom line , this debate was a shitshow, but for the most part it was a shitshow because of Trump\u2019s behavior. Now if you want to know who won or lost a debate the question you ask is who did the debate make you more likely to vote for? Here is the answer. In all my years following politics, I have NEVER seen a number as Low as Trump\u2019s for this question, for this debate.  NEVER. This debate did nothing to hurt Biden. It HURT Trump. And Biden didn't hurt him. Trump hurt himself BADLY tonight. ",

Trump is down by 6\u20137 points with Biden right at the magic number of 50%, and a slew of swing state polls just came out that look BAD. Another 1\u20133 points of lead added to Biden\u2019s national total and he\u2019s going to get 400 EVs. He came across as a repugnant bully. He refused to condemn a right wing hate group and repeatedly doubled down that he would not accept the election results if he lost. Trump needs to not only win undecideds but flip at least a few people who did not vote for him last time. How did this performance help him? ",

Talking over a moderator telling him to stop is so over the top that I believe that the 1st debate went poorly for the business tycoon. Polls that predicted Trump would lose the last presidential election turned out to be wrong but it\u2019s hard not to underestimate the impact of covid and just how fed up so many friends and relatives of the more than 200,000 who have died of covid are because of how their friends or relatives died. Trump may very well, in Tuesday\u2019s debate, energized his base but I find it hard to believe he went much further. ",

            "answer_text": "Trump has made it harder for a lot of normal Republicans to vote for him. His angry, fired up base will have seen the president they want to see - constantly on the attack, constantly domineering, but what of those conservative voters who expect two elderly guys to be able to argue in a civilised manner. As one commentator put it, if this \u201cdiscussion\u201d were to happen in a restaurant the maitre d\u2019 would be calling in security. And what of those \u201csuburban moms\u201d who try to instil in their children values such as taking turns, being respectful and not talking over people. They will have seen behaviour from Trump they would not allow in their children. Can they still vote for him? Biden is in a good position if the debate exposed what is going to be Trump\u2019s line of attack. Claims that Biden is a far left socialist simply don\u2019t wash, not outside Trump\u2019s narrowing base anyway. Biden had to pick a VP more to the left of him, but Kamala Harris is the least frightening of the possible choices to moderates. Above all Trump is showing conservative voters that he is out of control. If that performance was what his advisers recommended then he has really poor advisers. Far more likely is that Trump ignored his advisers and went by instinct. That may impress the \u201cProud Boys\u201d but it won\u2019t impress the small business owners and the company men who form a sizeable chunk of the Republican vote. ",

He attacked Biden in the wrong ways. Trump should\u2019ve gone after the things Biden has said, because there\u2019s a lot, instead of his son. That\u2019s a low blow. He had a couple good points but ultimately he conducted himself very poorly. I\u2019d hand it to Biden based off of that alone. ",

Trump lying to people is scary, he doesn\u2019t seem to care about the American people and his supporters aren\u2019t seeing that. Someone that cares would be trying to protect you not themselves. Other than the lies, he made some valid points, he\u2019s definitely more calm and has a better stage presence than Biden. One point he made that I absolutely cannot get behind is when he mentioned race sensitivity classes/ workshops are teaching Americans to hate this country. America is a melting pot of various religions, races, cultures etc. we 100% need workplace sensitivity training so every understands what is and what is not acceptable when addressing different people but I guess that could circle back to him also not wanted to denounce white supremacy on the same night. Biden on the other hand seems to care more about the people and their families, women\u2019s rights, affordable healthcare for the low income to middle class Americans which makes up more than half of the population. Biden calling Trump names was extremely unnecessary. He also seemed to be confused at certain times and allowed both Trump and the moderator to speak over and cut him off a lot. All in all the debate was a joke and I don\u2019t believe viewers gained anything from watching other than an hour and half comedy special. ",

Telling us that the American people want to reopen here without mentioning the fact that Trump and his croonies are responsible for over 200,000 deaths and counting. It\u2019s not just 200,000. Think of their families affected, their close friends. The jobs lost, around 40M. The unemployment rate dropped 8.4%, as Chris Wallace stated. The students who aren\u2019t able to go back to school, who can\u2019t see their friends normally. It\u2019s not just 200,000, we\u2019ve all been affected in some way.

My takeaway is this: This is the first time in 4 years that Trump has had to debate with someone who isn\u2019t within his bubble. After 4 years of non-stop insanity the overall American public got to see the culmination of what that looks like, live on stage. ",

Is that what we have come to in this country\u2014that an objectively bad performance must be defended. At some point Republicans have to give up the con. The debate was so bad, solely because of Trump\u2019s behavior, that the whole thing was a national embarrassment. But, I will admit this\u2014I expected no different from Republicans, just as I expected no different from Trump. I pretty much expected that shitshow and I pretty much expected Trump supporters to love it. In what world does a 90-minute temper tantrum (symbolic for the man\u2019s whole presidency) look good to someone. Objectively it should not. There were not good people on both sides. The contrast could not be more clear.  Republicans can use childish refrains, strut around like they won, pretend it wasn\u2019t fair how the moderator moderated; but at the end of the day reality will set in. Either they will wake up and realize we are headed to a fascist dictatorship under Trump and that would be bad or we will end up with a fascist dictatorship under Trump and it will be bad. There really is no wall to hide behind anymore, Trump is objectively the worse choice by far, ever in the history of this nation. If one still wants him to govern, then such a person actively wants a fascist dictatorship. Period. ",

If for over a year an individual has brought the following logic: feeling and thoughts = facts. Would anyone expect differently? America would fare better if Jill Stein and Gary Johnson were up there as well. Even though both lack the proper volume of a base, they would have intellectually challenged Clinton and the American people. They have excellent ideas, albeit many crazy ones as well.

Unable to keep his mouth shut, couldn\u2019t tell the truth if his life depended on it, broke all the rules, argued with the moderator, presented no facts, abused his opponent, had nothing ready, cracked under the mildest scintilla of pressure, lost his temper, added to his 20,000+ lies and counting, dog-whistled to white supremacists to stand back & stand by, proved beyond doubt he is the worst POTUS ever, and gave the world the most wonderful view of what he\u2019s really like and what the US has been suffering from since 2016. Yep, no doubt about it, he did just fine. ",

A common definition is \u201ca formal discussion on a particular topic in a public meeting or legislative assembly, in which opposing arguments are put forward.\u201d The presidential debates are set up to do just that to help the voting public evaluate the candidates on the pressing issues of the day. I watched the debate. However, I did not see any \u201cdebate\u201d by Mr. Trump. He had no arguments; only interruptions, disruptions, and wild assertions. He wouldn\u2019t let Joe Biden complete his arguments, and wouldn\u2019t even let the moderator moderate. Where was the \u201cdebate\u201d? So, he did a great job of disrupting, confusing, antagonizing, patronizing.and bullying. But, I submit, there is no debating Donald Trump. There is the uninformed, unformed, alpha-male opinion of 1. That opinion is to be rammed down the throats of anyone in the listening area. It is the \u201cdebate\u201d of a dictator or demagogue. ",

I can barely remember any substantive policies, but I do remember Trump calling VP Biden stupid because of Academic results 50 years ago and then taking the piss out of Biden\u2019s late son. The moderator may as-well have been a road sign. Dreadful debate but I do think Biden at least looked dignified and could not really have acted much differently. The \u201cpresident\u201d had a good goal on law and order as Biden\u2019s party seems to have loons in it that he would probably prefer disappeared. Biden\u2019s taxation points never landed as they were lost in waffle from Trump. At least Biden seemed lucid I guess. ",

To a certain extent, it worked - Biden did not push back on it anywhere near enough, and the moderator failed to take charge. Biden failed to make several points effectively because of it. The problem though, was that it was a bad strategy. Trump came across as bitter, rude, childish and petulant. The polling and general social media chitter-chatter afterwards shows that Trump did himself absolutely no favours by behaving in that way; people watch him debate like that and then wonder how he conducts himself in important domestic and international meetings. Obviously Trump\u2019s base love him BECAUSE he\u2019s an arrogant bully, but he doesn\u2019t need to play to his base, because they will vote for him regardless. It seems everyone else though, was deeply unimpressed. ",

Most people who watched didn\u2019t come away feeling 1) that the nation was in good hands 2) Trump had earned another 4 years. The real indicator of debate victory or defeat is the polls. If the President was unable to close the lead Biden had on him, then by definition, he \u2018lost\u2019 the debate. Why would Trump as the incumbent debate at all? The answer is because from a political perspective he had no choice. Trump is the current president, but most reliable national polls show him trailing Biden. This close to the election the only way to close that gap is with a direct appeal to the public. Of course, the real tell will be if Trump debates again. ",
