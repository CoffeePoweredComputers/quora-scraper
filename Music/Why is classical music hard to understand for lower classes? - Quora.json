            "answer_text": "Not just for the lower classes \u2013 for everybody who isn\u2019t willing to listen with an open mind and accept humbly that real art is greater than he or she is. Only a few very gifted people \u2013 mostly musicians \u2013 are able to understand classical music fully. But that doesn\u2019t mean that people can\u2019t enjoy it and even understand some part of it. And each time they hear it, they understand more of it. That\u2019s why you often hear people say: \u2018classical music is shit, but the four seasons, yeah that\u2019s great\u2019. They just don\u2019t understand they heard that piece more often than let\u2019s say Die Winterreise or some piano trio or string quartet and that\u2019s why they start to enjoy it (ok, and it\u2019s less complicated then Die Walk\u00fcre, e.g.). And no, you can be born in a poor family without any exposure to classical music and hear it one good day when you\u2019re six and know immediately: this is it. I know several musicians with that experience, some of them even famous ones. Of course, the utterly stupid idea that children can\u2019t enjoy classical music and have to be bombarded with pop trash with texts you wouldn\u2019t even give an adult to read from day one doesn\u2019t help. (Research has shown that very young children enjoy classical music, as long as you don\u2019t tell them it\u2019s complicated and for old white people. They also love classical music as long as it\u2019s called film music, and so do adults. Nobody complains about the music in Harry Potter, Star Wars or Out of Africa). What also doesn\u2019t help is the fact that children don\u2019t learn music at school anymore, hardly sing at school (if they do, they can\u2019t sing songs form twenty years ago, because their voices have an octave or so less range than before because most pop music has no range except for a few falsetto notes) and that they don\u2019t learn to read music and play an instrument. People are spoiled by the idea that everything should be aimed at the mediocre majority (IQ 100 and lower), because in our economy that works best. So they arrogantly assume that if they don\u2019t immediately grasp it or enjoy it, it\u2019s of no value. The opposite is true. Real art always has several layers, and in classical music, you need intelligence, musicality and time to hear the layers. You need time to learn to hear polyphony, to hear that the accompaniment or the second third of the fifth melody has a meaning and an emotion too and isn\u2019t a stupid never-ending repetition of a few simple rhythms. But it\u2019s actually a very old problem. Mozart wrote to his father he also put some things in his music so the long ears (stupid people for Mozart and to us: normal people) could enjoy it too. ",

            "answer_text": "Music is understood through hearing it, and using your own mind to make sense of it. If you have a lot of music of any style in your childhood, you will gain the \u201cears\u201d to understand its procedures, its slogans, its harmonies, its cliches, its symbols for magnificence or sadness or joy. We tend to hear music in terms of whatever our own social world has said about it. A missionary friend would play the Hallelujah Chorus in a deep-woods African mission, and they perceived it as funeral music! That was the closest analogy in style to what they had been doing for thousands of years, so that\u2019s how they read it. It was hard for me at first to understand rock music - as a child raised on classical and show tunes, what I heard on the radio sounded like a mishmash of loud, screechy noise. So I didn\u2019t listen to it; and that hampered my ability to understand it. I still don\u2019t understand most hip-hop, or various forms of alternative music, because I have been unwilling to sit down with it. My wife once asked my son why he liked Metallica, and he answered, \u201cbecause it\u2019s pretty.\u201d He had heard enough of it that the prettiness seeped in, while the rest of us only heard the screech of the metal. Classical music, especially that of composers such as Beethoven and Wagner and Stravinsky, can be pretty complicated - full of parts crossing one another and unique harmonies and surprises everywhere. This can be a shock when one has only heard pop or folk music, which usually has a single, easily-discerned melody in a high part, with lower sounds in predictable patterns being played by a piano or guitars. Through radio and TV, pop music has become a music for all classes; but if you see Lord of the Rings, or any feelgood movie, or any chase scene in a thriller, or a Bugs Bunny cartoon, you\u2019re probably listening to classical music.
