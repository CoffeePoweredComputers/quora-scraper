            "answer_text": "First, as it was pointed out in another answer here, you do not sing \u201cfrom the diaphragm\u201d. It\u2019s a widely used phrase that does not reflect the reality of what is really happening in your body during breathing and singing. The diaphragm is the biggest breathing muscle that sits at the bottom of your chest cavity. It is attached to your breastbone, lower ribs and some vertebrea. The diaphragm is a structure that you cannot touch or feel when it\u2019s working. The only thing you can feel and see is the result of the moving diaphragm. So, how do you know if your diaphragm is working properly when breathing and singing if you cannot touch it or feel it? Here are a few things that you can look for to know if you are using your diaphragm efficiently: Your torso is well aligned. The diaphragm can work efficiently only in a well aligned body. If your torso is misaligned, the diaphragm does not have space to descend fully during inhalation.Your torso expands in all directions during inhalation. If you allow your body to expand in all directions (not just your belly moving in), then the diaphragm has good conditions to work efficiently and descend fully.Your torso maintains expansion during singing. Your diaphragm wants to return to its dome-shaped position during singing or exhalation. It wants to relax. But by maintaining expansion in your torso, you are slowing down the ascending diaphragm. That is what a singer needs to do to sustain a sound.I made a video on this topic, so if you are interested, you can watch it:  ",

            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t really sing/breathe without your diaphragm because that\u2019s just how breathing works, so it\u2019s a matter of using the diaphragm optimally and more importantly where you\u2019re putting your air, not whether you\u2019re using or not. Here\u2019s a great and simple way to check that: Just put your hand softly covering your belly button, and then inhale and push it with your belly. If your belly inflates, rises and pushes your hand, you\u2019re doing it right. Simple as that. If you\u2019re able to breathe like that when you sing, you\u2019re doing it right, that\u2019s the correct way of doing it. You don\u2019t have to inflate your belly all the way, in fact less is more in this regard, the important thing here is where your air accumulates, because you want to feel it as low in the abdomen as you can. What you want to avoid is to tuck your belly in when inhaling. This is easier said than done, because most of our lives our parents, teachers, TV and magazines tells us to tuck in our belly and put our chest out. You must avoid this. At first it feels almost as if you have to re-learn how to breathe. Again, just put that belly out and it will serve as a reminder of how and where it feels to do it correctly. Another way of checking whether you\u2019re doing right or not, is to stand in front of a mirror. Inhale and check for your shoulders. if they rise right from the start of your inhaling then you\u2019re doing it wrong. DO NOT restrain the passage of air into your belly, you gotta relax it. Your shoulders should not rise until the very end of your intake of air, after your belly is completely inflated and out, and you feel as if you\u2019re almost out of room for any more. When you sing correctly and support it adequately from the diaphragm, it feels as if you\u2019re constantly inflating your belly. When you\u2019re belting out the notes, your belly feels flexible (not completely rigid), like a slightly deflated basket ball, and it\u2019s out, regardless if you\u2019re inhaling/exhaling or even running out of breath. As I\u2019ve mentioned in my other posts, singing correctly is at least 80% imagination, so just try to be more conscious of what\u2019s going on with your body when you\u2019re singing. Feel the air in when you inhale, have it push out that belly, relax your breathing, make it a habit to put it in your ab area and never your chest. Watch a video and go back to your high school text books to have a clear understanding of how your breathing system works, it\u2019ll make it a lot easier to imagine what you want your voice and your support muscles to do when you\u2019re training.
