            "answer_text": "Ah\u2026this question is EASY!  The most obvious answer you would think is the lead single off of MOTS: Persona, a little song called \u201cBoy With Luv\u201d.  This single was the crown jewel to BTS\u2019s unparalleled year in 2019, and broke 3 world records, including most viewed music video in 24 hours, at 78 million. Very popular, to say the least, with over 3.69 MILLION albums sold. But maybe the most popular song isn\u2019t the one from the best selling album EVER on the Gaon Chart. Ever heard of a little song called \u201cDNA\u201d?  The main single off of the first album in the Love Yourself trilogy, Her, this album sold over 1.4 Million copies; but what puts this song in the running as most popular is that this song is the one that MADE BTS: at least for western audiences. This song was the first to put BTS in the Billboard Hot 100, and gave the group it\u2019s first US tv debut on the AMA\u2019s, absolutely SHOCKING western viewers and Twitter. (it was hysterical to watch tbh). Now you could say either of these two amazing songs from two huge albums could be the most popular song from BTS. But I think in the long run, it\u2019s going to end up being \u201cSpring Day\u201d, at least in Korea.  The lead single from the repackaged album \u201cYou Never Walk Alone\u201d this song holds the record of being the longest charting song on Melon, at 142 weeks (as of Nov \u201819). This song tells a haunting story about overcoming a huge loss in one\u2019s life. Released in 2017, this song hasn\u2019t failed to bump up the charts once the weather starts to warm, and due to its link, however unintentional, to the Sewol Ferry tragedy, I doubt this song will be forgotten. So really what you\u2019ve got to look at isn\u2019t what\u2019s the most popular song from BTS; instead, start with how YOU personally measure popularity. Is it the song that broke the most records? The one that catapulted BTS to worldwide acclaim? Or the song that resonates the most with people? Only you decide. ",

            "answer_text": "Spring Day by a long shot. That song is a must listen for any new ARMY or anyone who\u2019s simply interesting in getting into BTS\u2019 discography. It was a beautiful and eloquent way to wrap The Most Beautiful moment In Life series. The song was a melancholic reflection on youth and the often tough transition into adulthood. The message of Spring Day is one that speaks to many people as it can be interpreted in many different ways based on your personal experiences. I also personally think Spring Day is one of BTS\u2019 most aesthetically pleasing music videos with a lovely message/story to top it off. Oh, and not to mention the way it charts every time BTS releases new content. That\u2019s legendary behavior. Blood Sweat and Tears is pretty iconic as well. The concept was something new for BTS and I would argue was also something never seen in K-pop. To base the whole song, music video, and well, pretty much the entirety of Wings off of the book Demian by Hermann Hesse was frankly genius. I couldn\u2019t tell you the last time a music artist structured their whole album around a fictional novel as well as have their own story to tell. Wings was a game changer is what I\u2019m saying\u2026 And Blood Sweat and Tear largely contributed to that. This song has incredibly music videos as well, very trippy, amazing imagery and symbolism, you could never get tired of watching them. I Need U is a song I\u2019d also add to the list. Seeing as how this song was BTS\u2019 first win, that alone makes this song iconic. This was the song that launched their success not only in Korea, but internationally as well. I Need U also started the BU which makes it an important staple in BTS\u2019 discography. We Are Bulletproof, Pt 2 and No More Dream could also be considered \u201ciconic\u201d as they were BTS\u2019 debut songs. But I also feel like their reputation is a little less positive that the other songs listed\u2026 They mostly seem to be used for memes and jokes but nonetheless, still iconic! ",
