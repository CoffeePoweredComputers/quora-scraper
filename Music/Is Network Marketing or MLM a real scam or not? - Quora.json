            "answer_text": "It is important to realize who advocates the industry.  Robert Kiyosaki made his hundreds of millions of dollars long before he started advocating Network Marketing as the business of the 21st Century.  The reality is that he does not need a single $ form the Network Marketing industry or its members, he does however want people to become succesful, and through all his years in the business world, he has recognised how impactful the business model of Network Marketing is and how someone from any social or economic background, whether educated or not, can embrace the business and become succesful doing it.  Same goes for Donald Trump, love him or loathe him, the same applies for his realization of what the business is and what it can do for people.  Besides those two individuals, a past President of the United States of America said in a speech once how thankful he was for the Direct Selling members of America for helping the Economy,   Why does Network Marketing or Direct Sales have a bad name for so many? It is because it is too easy to start a business, often for under a $100 - you basically receive a multi-million $ business for less than $100 - this means that many thousands of individuals try their hand at it and after a few rejections, complain about the business being bad - when in reality it is their unwillingness to learn the business and apply tried and tested ways to make it succesful for them too.  Take this as an example, Imagine if everyone was given the opportunity to purchase a McDonald's franchise/business for $100 - how many, would you think, would take it seriously, study that manual and do everything that was necessary to make it a success?  Not many, because their initial outlay was not of significant value to them so if they were to come up with a few rejections, they can very easily pack it in and move on. Let me tell you, it is significantly more challenging to operate a succesful network marketing business than it is to own a McDonald's franchise, because you have to get out there and overcome 90% rejection, where all your time spent is unpaid in the beginning, you are often completely challenging the status quo and beliefs that are deep seeded in people's minds, you are learning to become a better person and learning to have better conversations so you can get your point through more effectively, all while not being paid.  There are not many people in the world who would take time out of their busy schedule to do something that initially is unpaid, where they will face multiple rejections and often loose friends and acquaintances who do not have an abundant mindset or are not prepared to get out of their comfort zone. There is nothing more exhilarating than creating a life of abundance and meeting like minded people on the way who have that same abundant mindset, who want more out of life and who are not prepared to settle for a life that they are not in complete control of, and that is why this $191 billion freight train is gathering more and more momentum as more and more people understand what this wonderful opportunity really is when done correctly and with integrity. Regarding Herbalife, well it really is up to you, realize though that there are different Compensation plans and some are 30+ years old and cannot be updated, only investigate a company that is at least 10 years old though, as many, 90% will fail within 10 years.  health and wellness is the greatest market trends right now so if you do consider learning about the industry, start with companies leading that field.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been affiliated with a Network Marketing company for 3 months now. What really helped me was a belief in my company\u2019s product. If you don\u2019t believe in the product(s) or service(s) offered then your business will never succeed. Be prepared to be in the most uncomfortable situations of your life, but if you meet the challenges head-on with confidence and belief then you will learn and grow i.e. succeed in ways you never imagined. There are never failures, just lessons and success. Network Marketing is taking your future into your hands. You\u2019ll learn a lot about yourself that you never before. I\u2019ve had corporate and government jobs in the past and Network Marketing blows them all away. I\u2019ve never worked harder and been more excited in my life than I am right now. I\u2019m surprised to learn that Network Marketing has helped me in other areas of my life that I never considered. OK, so you believe in what your company offers, GREAT! Now you need awesome mentor-ship, proper team training/building duplication and tools to help you. Compensation plan, Company Saturation in your area, tools and training factor into deciding what company you should partner with. Some are most definitely better than others. You have to be a self-starter! Anything that goes wrong is your fault! It is never the prospect, your up-line, down-line, the product etc. If you can handle that then Network Marketing is a viable option. Unless you want to be a school teacher, doctor, lawyer \u2026 in this point in time, in the US, I think it is absolutely crazy for young adults to purposely choose to be in debt $30k-100k for 10\u201320 years when there is ZERO guarantee of a profitable job in their chosen field waiting for them. In 2015, the unemployment rate nationally is 5\u20136%, but among college graduates it is 15% \u2026 the average college graduate will send out 80\u2013100 resumes for a handful of recruiter callbacks, maybe a single interview, meanwhile they are out of specialized work for 6\u201312 months or very underpaid because employers undercut starting salaries. If you master 6\u20137 simple skills in Network Marketing, you will be well on your way to creating the life that you want to live. ",
