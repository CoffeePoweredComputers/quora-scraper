Six-string steel guitars: D\u2019Addario EXP16 light-gauge stringsTwelve-string guitars: D\u2019Addario EXP38 light-gauge stringsSix-string nylon guitars: D\u2019Addario EXP45 Coated Normal Tension strings That said I have switched to Elixir strings of a similar gauge on my Tak.

If it is an acoustic guitar, odds are it will be xxxxxxbrand 12 gauge. That\u2019s pretty much the industry standard. One of the very very first things I do with a new guitar is take the factory strings off and put my favorite 11 gauge on. A lot of guys do this. ",
