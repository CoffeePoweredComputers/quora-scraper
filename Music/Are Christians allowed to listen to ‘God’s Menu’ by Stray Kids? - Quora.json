            "answer_text": "This question is based on a couple of false premises: \u201cChristians\u201d are not a monolithic group, so any questions about what Christians as a whole are \u201callowed\u201d to do are essentially meaningless. You could name any activity, and there is probably some group of Christians, somewhere, that is not \u201callowed\u201d to do it by whatever spiritual authority they adhere to.There is no single human authority that absolutely forbids Christians as a whole from doing anything in particular. In answer to a question about whether it is allowed to eat meat that has been sacrificed to idols in a Pagan temple, Paul wrote:1 Corinthians 10:23-33 (NRSV) 23 \"All things are lawful,\" but not all things are beneficial. \"All things are lawful,\" but not all things build up. 24 Do not seek your own advantage, but that of the other. 25 Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience, 26 for \"the earth and its fullness are the Lord's.\" 27 If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you are disposed to go, eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience. 28 But if someone says to you, \"This has been offered in sacrifice,\" then do not eat it, out of consideration for the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience\u2014 29 I mean the other's conscience, not your own. For why should my liberty be subject to the judgment of someone else's conscience? 30 If I partake with thankfulness, why should I be denounced because of that for which I give thanks? 31 So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything for the glory of God. 32 Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God, 33 just as I try to please everyone in everything I do, not seeking my own advantage, but that of many, so that they may be saved. The implied meaning is that it is up to the individual and their relationship with God to determine what their conscience will \u201callow\u201d a Christian to do.The bottom line is that if you think it\u2019s forbidden, then it probably is for you, and if you believe that in doings something, someone else may be led to do what THEY consider a sin, then it is better not to do it. But it is not a matter of being \u201callowed\u201d to do it by some external authority. It is between yourself and God as to what is allowed or not.",

            "answer_text": "Okay, I must point out that some of the members of Stray Kids (who not only sung the song but wrote it as well) are Christian. Likewise, it has nothing to do with God nor does it really have anything bad in general. I know lots of Christians who listen to it, and I would actually recommend you to maybe check the lyrics out first to determine whether you would want to listen as well. anyways, stream God\u2019s Menu please :) ",
