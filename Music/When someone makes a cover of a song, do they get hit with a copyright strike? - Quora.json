            "answer_text": "Yes. But. Yes, recording a cover of someone else's song violates the author's Right To Perform. The bigger question is: How does that play out, practically? These days, YouTube's algorithm for scouring it content for copyright violations is pretty good. They'll catch it. However, the vast majority of musicians don't actually NOT want you to play their music. They just want to get paid for it. YouTube monetizes your views by selling ads which wind up in your YouTube video. A percentage of those proceeds go back to the recording artist. Sometimes, the algorithm doesn't catch bedroom guitar players and\u2026you get away with it. The alternative would be for YouTube to purge a LOT of content or for the copyright owner to sue. Neither of those are great options and nobody really makes money that way. Yes, unauthorized covers are not legal. But, YouTube found a way to get 1) Artists justly paid and 2) Your video to stay online. ",

That\u2019s why people that make covers of songs secure the appropriate license to do so. There are a number of agencies through which you can go to secure the rights to record and distribute a song cover. The cost is typically less than $100 and can be as cheap as $20 or so. Once a license is secured, that person would no longer infringing on copyright (because they licensed the rights). ",
