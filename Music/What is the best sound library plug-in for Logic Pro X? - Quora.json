            "answer_text": "Logic comes with a lot. A LOT. And they keep adding more. The 10.5 release has a ton of new stuff. The built-in instruments are pretty great - Alchemy, especially is a world class sound deisgn synthesizer with a huge library of sound sources. It\u2019s also a fairly credible multi-layer sampler, too, and can load all the logic-included EXS24 /Sampler libraries as sound sources (which can be analyzed for granular processing or additive resynthesis). I know a bunch of folks are going to say Omnisphere. And Omnisphere is\u2026fine. It does sound really good. It\u2019s getting a bit long in the tooth, though - a lot of the stock sounds in it have been used ubiquitously (the Breaking Bad soundtrack is basically the amped lightbulb and the slide guitar presets, for example). It\u2019s sort of de rigueur if you\u2019re doing commercial cues or scoring, but if you want to do, say, dance music, the \u201cEDM\u201d library is pretty dated and you\u2019ll either have to buy third party sound sets - or program your own. The sound design and programming engine is wonderful, but also very complicated, and the user interface is by most objective usability measurements kind of a trashfire. It\u2019s also rather expensive as plugins go, although not as expensive as certain specialized scoring libraries. A number of producers swear by Nexus for pop and dance music production. It\u2019s a straight ROMpler with little in the way of programmability, but they keep pushing out specialized sets for specific modern genres of music. UVI makes a number of standalone libraries, including some rather fun and esoteric ones. They\u2019re not especially programmable or editable in and of themselves unless you purchase the UVI Falcon synth/sampler, which lets you leverage those libraries in numerous interesting ways. Of course, if you get NI Kontakt, you\u2019ll have access to a bewildering variety of third party soundsets for specialized use, from cinematic whooshes and impacts to ethnic drummers to solo instruments and all sorts of stuff in between. It\u2019s certainly a deep rabbit hole. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what kind of instruments you need, and what genres of music you want to produce. For synth and electronic sounds, Spectrasonics Omnisphere is the best you can get. The sounds are of amazing quality, the synth engine is very powerful and the library is sample based, which adds to its deep, complex sound. Massive, Absynth, and Sylenth are also very good. For orchestral music take your pick, as it largely comes down to personal preference. A few great brands to check out are ProjectSAM, Vienna Symphonic Library, East West Quantum Leap Symphonic Library  and home of LA Scoring Strings. All of these libraries are fantastic, and it usually comes down to which one you just like the best. I usually listen to lots of demos and youtube videos before making a decision on which library to get.  Then you've got Native Instruments' Komplete, which is a bundle of pretty much everything you need, but besides the great synths included, the acoustic libraries are average. It's sort of a jack-of-all-trades, but the sounds are good, and it's a great starting point to have pretty much every instrument you need. ",
