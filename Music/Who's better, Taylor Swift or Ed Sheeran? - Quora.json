            "answer_text": "For me, Taylor Swift. I've been her hard-core fan for almost 2 years now, I think she's better because of her personality. Many people say that she's fake, but literally no person would invite complete strangers to their house and bake cookies for them and show them all of her new songs which haven't even been released yet and risk leaking the whole album. Also, who takes just $1 in a sexual abuse case?! She wanted the man to be punished, which was done by the court. She even raised her political views and stood up for LGBTQ+ community. And Ed Sheeran? Even though he and Taylor are good friends, he didn't even say anything when Taylor lost her rights to her albums which was devastating and horrible.. I just have no words and I really don't think that this world deserves such an angel. ",
