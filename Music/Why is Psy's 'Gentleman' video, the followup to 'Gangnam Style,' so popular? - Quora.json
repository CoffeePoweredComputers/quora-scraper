            "answer_text": "Because they marketed it so well that when everyone opened their youtube, the first video they saw was this or it was the very first video in their side bar. Like you or me, who never watched it before, were astonished with its large viewer count and clicked on it, get entertained for a while and moved on to some important stuff and wondered the same question \"Why the hell should it get so many viewers?\". But we all unknowingly contribute to that number- \"Popularity effect\". But however popular doesn't mean important but unfortunately it means money for the creators and propagating  unhealthy ideas, entertainments or memes. ",
