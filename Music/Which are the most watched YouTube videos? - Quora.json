            "answer_text": "Top 15 most famous songs are List from lower to upper\u2026 15. Blank Space \u2013 Taylor Swift  Blank Space is Taylor Swift\u2019s second entry on this list. It comes from her fifth studio album, \u201c1989\u201d (as does Shake it Off). The song was released in November 2014, and within three weeks it topped the US Billboard Hot 100, knocking Shake it Off from that position. Taylor Swift became the first woman in the chart\u2019s history to succeed herself at the top. Joseph Kahn was asked to direct the video. Taylor Swift liked the idea of portraying herself as a crazy villain in the video. It was partly inspired by \u201cA Clockwork Orange\u201d and constant tabloid gossip about Taylor Swift\u2019s relationships. Taylor Swift - Blank Space 14. Dark Horse \u2013 Katy Perry ft. Juicy J  Not to be outdone by Taylor Swift, Katy Perry also features two videos in this list of the 15 most viewed YouTube videos of all time. Katy recorded Dark Horse with rapper Juicy J, releasing the song in September 2013. It combines the genres of trap and hip-hop. Pepsi used the song in a promotion. Fans could vote on Twitter whether they wanted this song or Walking on Air to be released as the first single from the album, \u201cPrism.\u201d Dark Horse sold 13.2 million units and was the second-best selling song of 2014. The video wasn't released until February 2014. It has an Egyptian setting, where Katy plays \u201cKaty Patra\u201d \u2013 her version of the Egyptian queen, Cleopatra. Dark Horse was the first video from a female artist to receive 1 billion views on YouTube. Katy Perry - Dark Horse (Official) ft. Juicy J 13. Hello \u2013 Adele  English singer, Adele, released Hello in October 2015 as the lead single from her third album, \u201c25\u201d. It was successful in many countries, reaching the top position across the world, including in both the UK and USA. The music video, which stars Adele and Tristan Wilds, was directed by Xavier Dolan. It broke the record for the shortest time to reach 1 billion views on YouTube \u2013 88 days. It currently has over 12 million likes, making it the fifth most liked video on YouTube. Adele - Hello 12. Lean On \u2013 Major Lazer and DJ Snake ft. M\u00d8  Lean On comes from Major Lazer\u2019s third album. \u201cPeace is the Mission.\u201d It is a house ballad. In became the most streamed song of all time on Spotify in November 2015, although Drake\u2019s One Dance overtook it the following year.

M\u00d8) (Official Music Video) 11. Roar \u2013 Katy Perry  Who hasn\u2019t seen the Katy Perry video for Roar, with Katy in her jungle, populated with wild animals? She released Roar as the lead single for her 2013 album, \u201cPrism\u201d The lyrics focus on standing up for yourself and self-empowerment. The song was a huge success. It was certified as Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), making her the first artist to have three Diamond Awards. The video tells a (fictional) story of Katy Perry adapting to life in the jungle after surviving a plane crash. She even tames a tiger. It was filmed at the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden. When Roar reached 1 billion video views on YouTube, in July 2015, Katy Perry became the first artist to have two music videos exceed that milestone. Katy Perry - Roar (Official) 10. Bailando \u2013 Enrique Iglesias ft. Descemer Bueno and Gente De Zona  Bailando is another music video that highlights the international appeal of YouTube. Spanish singer, Enrique Iglesias, recorded Bailando for his tenth studio album, \u201cSex and Love\u201d in 2014. He recorded several versions of the song. The original Spanish version also included vocals by Cubans, Descemer Bueno, and Gente de Zona. A Spanglish version features vocals by Jamaican singer Sean Paul. Enrique Iglesias also recorded two versions in Portuguese (with different people doing the additional vocals) for different markets. The original Spanish version acts as the theme song for the soap opera Reina de Corazones. They recorded four music videos\u2013 one for each version of the song. They filmed the videos for the Spanish and Spanglish version of the song in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. The Spanish version has proven particularly popular, having been viewed more than 2.4 million times. People have also watched the Spanglish version 250 million times. Enrique Iglesias - Bailando ft. Descemer Bueno, Gente De Zona (Espa\u00f1ol) 9. Shake It Off \u2013 Taylor Swift  Taylor Swift recorded Shake it Off as the lead single for her fifth album, \u201c1989\u201d. The song premiered on a Yahoo! Live stream on August 18, 2014. The studio released the video on YouTube and made the song available for digital download on the same day. Shake it Off is Taylor Swift\u2019s most successful Billboard Hot 100 song to date. It stayed in the chart for 50 consecutive weeks. Mark Romanek directed the video, and it features dances choreographed by Tyce Diorio. It incorporates dancing in the styles of hip-hop, lyrical, ballet, jazz, and cheerleader \u2013 even \u201ctwerking.\u201d If you exclude the cartoon character of Masha, this video holds the record for the most views of a video by a female artist. Taylor Swift - Shake It Off 8. Sugar \u2013 Maroon 5  Sugar was recorded by Maroon 5 for their fifth studio album, \u201cV.\u201d It was released as a single on January 13, 2015. It peaked at Number 2 on the US Billboard 100. The band worked with film director, David Dobkin on the music video. He had previously directed the movie \u201cWedding Crashers,\u201d and used that as inspiration for this video. In the video, Maroon 5 crashes weddings across Los Angeles. This is not staged. Maroon 5 has genuinely crashed the weddings shown in the video. In reality, each groom was given some notice and agreed to let an unnamed, but famous band play at their wedding, but nobody else connected with the marriages had advance notice. It must have been a shock to the brides to find Adam Levine serenading them at their weddings. The production team worked with wedding planners in Los Angeles to find suitable weddings for the video. The band found it a fantastic experience. They were nervous that they would take attention away from people\u2019s big days. Some of the grooms got cold feet and had to be talked into allowing the activity take place. Everybody loved the surprise, however. Adam Levine stated, \"It was an out of body experience. I had no idea I would be affected by the overwhelming reactions we received from the couples and guests. Maroon 5 - Sugar 7. Sorry \u2013 Justin Bieber  It should surprise nobody that Justin Bieber has a video on YouTube\u2019s Top 10. He is one of the most visible symbols of the YouTube generation. It is perhaps surprising that he cannot claim more of the videos in this top group, although he does have videos of his songs in positions 23 and 24. Sorry comes from Justin Bieber\u2019s fourth studio album, \u201cPurpose.\u201d It was released on October 23, 2015. The song topped the charts of 13 countries, including seven weeks in the top spot in Bieber's native Canada. Globally, people bought more than 10 million copies of the song in 2016. Unusually, they made the dance video of the song in New Zealand, featuring New Zealand dancers \u2013 the ReQuest Dance Crew, and New Zealand choreographer, Parris Goebel. Although this was originally just intended to be a lyric video, it ended up as the main one. It became the fifth fastest YouTube video to reach 1 billion views, and the fourth fasted to reach 2 billion views. Justin Bieber - Sorry (PURPOSE : The Movement) 6. UpTown Funk \u2013 Mark Ronson ft. Bruno Mars  UpTown Funk was recorded by British record producer, Mark Ronson, along with American singer/songwriter, Bruno Mars. It was released as a single on 10 November 2014. It spent 14 consecutive weeks at Number 1 on the US Billboard 100, and also reached Number 1 in the charts in several other countries. UpTown Funk became the second best-selling single of 2015. It won two Grammy Awards, including the record of the Year. The music video was released a week after the single \u2013 17 November 2014. It shows Bruno Mars, Mark Ronson, and the Hooligans walking around cities, kitted out in brightly colored suits and chains. It was filmed in a range of cities where Bruno Mars was touring. The video was almost as popular as the song, gathering more than 2.8 billion views to date. Mark Ronson - Uptown Funk ft. Bruno Mars 5. Masha and the Bear: Recipe for Disaster \u2013 Get Movies  This is by far the most unusual video on this list. It is not a music video. It is not an official video (although official copies of this episode do exist on YouTube). And it is in Russian. This particular video is technically called \u041c\u0430\u0448\u0430 \u0438 \u041c\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0435\u0434\u044c (Masha and The Bear) - \u041c\u0430\u0448\u0430 \u043f\u043b\u044e\u0441 \u043a\u0430\u0448\u0430, as it is a Russian version. Masha and the Bear is a Russian animated television series, loosely based on an oral children\u2019s folk story. It is a Russian children\u2019s television series, of four series (to date) consisting of 68 episodes. Some episodes of the English-language version are available on Netflix. All of the episodes have been uploaded to YouTube over time, and three of them have exceeded 1 billion views. There is an official YouTube channel \u2013 MashaMedvedTV. It is thought that one of the reasons for the show\u2019s popularity is that Masha is dressed in a folk costume with a headscarf. Her legs are covered. This has makes the show acceptable to Muslim audiences, including in populous countries, such as Indonesia. This particular episode, \u201cRecipe for Disaster,\u201d was originally episode number 17. It is episode 7.1 on Netflix (which has combines several of the short Masha and the Bear episodes together). \u041c\u0430\u0448\u0430 \u0438 \u041c\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0435\u0434\u044c (Masha and The Bear) - \u041c\u0430\u0448\u0430 \u043f\u043b\u044e\u0441 \u043a\u0430\u0448\u0430 (17 \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0438\u044f) 4. Gangnam Style \u2013 Psy  It would be fair to say that Gangnam Style was an unexpected mega-hit, that set records on YouTube, that some people believed would never be bettered. The video shows Psy poking fun at the style of Seoul\u2019s Gangnam-gu. This is claimed to be, \u201ca flashy district with high rents, high expectations and a focus on the high-status lifestyle.\" Psy\u2019s official YouTube account uploaded the video on July 15, 2012. On November 24th that year, Gangnam Style overtook Justin Bieber\u2019s then-record of 803,700,000 views to take the coveted Number 1 spot on YouTube. It stayed in that position for an incredible 1,689 days. Gangnam Style didn\u2019t take long to take the accolade of being the first video to reach 1 billion views on YouTube, receiving that honor in December 2012. It reached 2 billion views in June 2014, and 3 billion in January 2018. The video holds a few other YouTube records. It was the most rated video until February 2017, and most liked video until August 2016. Until Adele\u2019s Hello passed it on January 18, 2016, it held the record for the fastest video to reach 1 billion views. It still holds the record for being the most discussed video. PSY - GANGNAM STYLE(\uac15\ub0a8\uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c) M/V 3. Shape of You \u2013 Ed Sheeran  Ed Sheeran had a hugely successful 2017. No matter where you went, there always seemed to be an Ed Sheeran song playing. He even performed a cameo role in an episode of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d He released Shape of You as a digital download on 6 January 2017. He also included it as part of his third studio album. The song made it to Number 1 on the singles charts of 44 countries. It topped the Billboard Year-End Hot 100 Singles of 2017. It was nominated for Best Pop Solo Performance at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards. Ed Sheeran released a lyric video for the song on his channel. People have viewed that version over 750 million times to date. On 30 January 2017, the official video was uploaded to YouTube. The video became one of the fastest videos to reach 1 billion views on YouTube. It achieved this milestone on 8 May 2017, just 97 days after its release. Ed Sheeran - Shape of You [Official Video] 2. See You Again \u2013 Wiz Khalifa ft. Charlie Puth  See You Again held YouTube\u2019s Number One position from July 10 to August 4, 2017, and was the video that finally broke \u201cGangnam Style\u2019s\u201d hold on the top rank. It was, of course, only 25 days, until Despacito made its charge and overtook See You Again. The main reason for See You Again\u2019s success was that it was commissioned as the theme for the movie, \u201cFurious 7\u201d. It was written as a tribute to fan-favorite, the late actor Paul Walker. It is both Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth\u2019s most successful track to date. The song spent 12 weeks at the top of the US Billboard 100 and reached Number One in a number of other countries. It also held the record for the most streamed track in a single day on Spotify in the US, as well as records for most streams in a week worldwide and in the UK. Overall, See You Again was the best selling song in the world in 2015. Wiz Khalifa - See You Again ft. Charlie Puth [Official Video] Furious 7 Soundtrack 1. Despacito \u2013 Luis Fonsi ft. Daddy Yankee  Despacito\u2019s rise to the top of this list in 2017, demonstrates two essential points about YouTube. Firstly, it shows that YouTube\u2019s popularity is forever increasing. There was a time when nobody thought that anybody would overtake Gangnam Style. It also demonstrates how YouTube is now a global phenomenon. Despacito, which is Spanish for \u201cSlowly,\u201d is sung in Spanish by Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi and also features Puerto Rican rapper Daddy Yankee. The music video shows both artists performing the song in La Perla neighborhood of Old San Juan, Puerto Rico and the local bar La Factor\u00eda. The song topped the charts of 47 countries and entered the Top 10 in ten others. It was the first song to top the Billboard 100 in Spanish in 20 years. Interestingly, Justin Bieber released a remix version a few months later, where he sang some lines in English. While this probably helped the original\u2019s YouTube performance, it didn\u2019t overtake it or enter the YouTube Most Viewed charts. Despacito became the first video on YouTube to achieve the milestones of both three and four billion views. It overtook See You Again to take YouTube\u2019s All-time Number 1 spot in August 2017.

            "answer_text": "There are several things that come to mind for the most viewed topics on YouTube. The first answer, I'm almost certain, is music. This is most likely because people listen to songs dozens of times over short spans of time, if they like the song in question. The most popular songs on YouTube, like \u201cDespacito\u201d and \u201cGangnam Style\u201d, have several billion views. It's extremely easy for a catchy song by a popular artist to amass hundreds of millions, if not billions of views over the course of a year or two. I don't know of a single non-music video on YouTube that has over a billion views (although some of them are getting there). A distant second to music videos for consistently high view count is movie clips. These videos don't accumulate anywhere near as much viewership as music videos, but they still receive tons of traffic. This for the same reason as music, just to a far less exaggerated extent; people watch these videos repeatedly. Every time a popular movie comes out on DVD/digital download, all of the favorite scenes in the movie will be uploaded to YouTube as short clips. Next up in my mind would be gun channels. YouTube has started to crack down on this type of content, but these videos also have a tendency to gain tons of views, especially if they have clickbaity titles and well-established followings already. I wouldn't recommend anyone start a gun channel on YouTube if they don't already have one, but these videos get lots of views. Any deeper than this it gets kind of hazy for me, but, in no particular order, I'll put some \u201chonorable mentions\u201d down next. Satire and comedy, specifically stand-upVideo gamesNews and politicsMakeup tutorialsPets and animalsScienceJust another quick piece of advice. Don't rely on YouTube directly for making money. Create a PayPal account and a Patreon so your viewers can support you directly. YouTube has had two events so far that users have dubbed the \u201cAd-pocalypse\u201d, making it harder for content that is not \u201cadvertiser-friendly\u201d to be directly monetized, and controversial content is de-ranked in terms of search and recommendation priority. Use the site, fine, but definitely don't trust them. Also, use other sites like Minds and Bitchute to upload your content. ",
