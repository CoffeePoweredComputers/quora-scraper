            "answer_text": " Under no circumstances is BEATLES FOR $ALE the worst of the original albums. But remember, \u201cworst\u201d is relative\u2026The Beatles\u2019 \u201cworst\u201d is better than the average band\u2019s best, even fifty years after they broke up. (Hell, Bob Dylan\u2019s SELF-PORTRAIT has gotten revisionist praise over the past decade!) On the other hand, I\u2019m not Beatlemaniacal enough to say that every album is five stars. Even the Gods can slip up sometimes. BEATLES FOR SALE was a direct casualty of Beatlemania. The album before it, A HARD DAY\u2019S NIGHT was an exciting, fun, and at times, artistically enriching time for the band, as were the singles, the film, the tours, and everything else in the first half of 1964. However, all of this activity left us with four weary Beatles, exhausted in mind, body and soul. And songwriting. By the time they needed to record their next disc for the all-important holiday season, John Lennon and Paul McCartney had no gas left in the tank. Nor was George Harrison ready to start becoming a regular writer, else I'm sure Lennon, McCartney and producer George Martin would have welcomed a Harrison composition or two\u2026for this particular emergency only, of course. After this hiccup, McCartney and Lennon would never need song assistance again. (Well, John would, but we'll get back to that). While the quality of the songs John and Paul came up with does vary, the opening Lennon-McCartney trifecta is five-stars. \u201cNo Reply\u201d is the first album opener that doesn't slam you with clanging guitars, screaming vocals or an insistent beat. It's mellow, like John wondering aloud to himself about the state of his wrecked relationship. With his boys, Paul and George, he explodes with fury to his afar girl that \u201cI SAW THE LIGHT!\u201d and \u201cI NEARLY DIED!\u201d Then he settles down again. Second song, \u201cI'm A Loser\u201d, is the first overt usage of Bob Dylan in a Beatles song, from lyrical structure to wailing harmonica. It's perhaps the deepest song The Beatles attempted up to that point. Third, \u201cBaby's In Black\u201d finds John and Paul in Everly Brothers mode, using the colour black as a metaphor for lost love. The first cover is Chuck Berry's \u201cRock And Roll Music\u201d which John tears the sh*t out of with his throat-shredding vocal. He, Paul, and George Martin are all on piano at the same time. My favourite track on the album, it's light years heavier than Berry's original, and what you return to after the way The Beach Boys made it toothless twelve years later. After this, I have to admit the disc starts to sag a bit\u2014-it never quite recaptures the momentum of those first four tunes. The Lennon-McCartney songbook was so tapped out that Macca had to resuscitate a song he wrote when he was sixteen, \u201cI'll Follow The Sun.\u201d \u201cEight Days A Week\u201d became a U.S. #1, but more because it was The Beatles who did it rather than it being a spectacular tune. This also explains the overabundance of covers, \u201cHoney Don't,\u201d \u201cWords Of Love\u201d and \u201cMr. Moonlight\u201d---the last of these I was shocked to learn that it was one of the most despised Beatles songs of all time. (I have no idea why, as it's a fine recording.) Carl Perkins' \u201cEverybody\u2019s Trying To Be My Baby,\u201d though a good rendition, was the absolute worst choice to close the album with---it lacks the punch of \u201cTwist And Shout\u201d and \u201cMoney (That's What I Want)\u201d on the first two albums, or the wistful warning of \u201cI'll Be Back\u201d from AHDN. The finale honour should have gone to either \u201cEvery Little Thing,\u201d which has a lovely sentiment, or \u201cKansas City\u201d/\u201dHey Hey Hey Hey,\u201d with it's proto-anthemic fade-out. Two underrated gems are John's \u201cI Don't Want To Spoil The Party\u201d and Paul's \u201cWhat You're Doing.\u201d So although there are missteps, the bulk of this disc is great, making it a damn decent four-star Fabs record. No, if you want the worst Beatles album, you want this nonsense:  Actually, with John in a songwriting-challenged heroin stupor (egged on by his ever-loving wart, Bobo Floyo); Paul coming off as arrogant and bullying as he tried to whip the band into shape; George consistently put down by and rightfully resentful of both men; and Phil Spector\u2019s awful kitchen sink production all culminating in the most depressing, most artistically unrewarding project in Beatles history\u2026 \u2026you don't want this nonsense.

            "answer_text": "Sorry, yes. Leaving aside Yellow Submarine, which doesn\u2019t count. Of the eleven albums the Beatles put together themselves (plus Magical Mystery Tour which has acquired canonical status, and anyway contains four of the finest recordings in history, and a handful of other ones that are pretty good), Beatles For Sale is the one that works least well - the band were exhausted, they had honed their professional songwriting, but they just didn\u2019t have the time and energy to make any forward moves right then. They had been working non-stop for a year and a half, released three albums already, plus singles, and a movie. There just wasn\u2019t that much in the tank - witness the resurrection of I\u2019ll Follow The Sun, a song Paul wrote when he was 15 or 16. By the time of their next record, Help!, (1965) their professionalism had got them back to writing solid pop, and by the time of their second album of 1965 (!) Rubber Soul, they had embarked on the finest three album run in the history of pop. ",
