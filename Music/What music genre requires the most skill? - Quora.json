            "answer_text": "None, in particular. Any musician can develop the capability to make whatever type of music he/she truly desires. I used to think I would never play classical music or read standard notation\u2026 guess what? Through determination and work I have achieved just that. And, by the way, \u201ctalent\u201d is a myth-- actually a harmful one. As someone who has been creating and performing for 25 years, I have witnessed a lot of harm done by the myth of \u201ctalent.\u201d \u201cTalent\" is the excuse of the lazy. It is the refuge of minds who have decided that they, or someone else, are magically incapable of something. \u201cI\u2019ll never be as good as X, he\u2019s so talented.\u201d Or, my personal hate-favorite, \u201cDon't quit your day job,\u201d which is what the obstinate and unimaginative say to the person who is actually trying, on their way, to improve. \u201cNo one will ever play the guitar like Jimi Hendrix.\u201d \u201cNo one will ever dunk like Jordan, because of his rare, magical talent.\u201d Bullsh!t. They've both been surpassed by those willing to put in the work. \u201cTalent\u201d is the false idea that some deity or mysterious force of nature gifted a select few of us with magical abilities, and only us, so the rest of you need not even try. It\u2019s crap. There are some physical limitations/handicaps that can't be overcome, sure. Something like .6% of the population is actually deaf, and only a tiny fraction more than that are physically tone deaf. There are those who have muscular dystrophy or missing limbs, etc\u2014 but there are many musicians who have overcome such limitations, so it\u2019s not really non-negotiable (Def Leppard\u2019s drummer is just one example). Tell Spud Webb that a guy under six feet tall can\u2019t dunk, and watch him do it at 5\u20327\u2033. Muggsy Bogues, though he never dunked in an NBA game, could dunk two-handed at 5\u20323,\u201d with a vertical leap of 44 inches! There are four factors which determine and contribute to someone's success in any endeavor. Exposure. All the best basketball players grew up in an area where basketball was prized as a sport, in families that encouraged or participated in playing or watching basketball. Many of the best musicians come from \u201cmusical families;\u201d not because the mystical \u201ctalent\u201d is genetic, no! Musical families are families that promote, encourage, or participate in musical activities. An important reason that so many amazing concert violinists come from China and Japan is that a high number of families there encourage and promote violin as a valued skill.Enthusiasm. Usually due to exposure and the modeling of one\u2019s influences, enthusiasm for a skill leads to exploring the skill and developing it. Without enthusiasm, or passion for something, no one bothers.Determination. This is driven by one\u2019s exposure and enthusiasm. The determination to master a skill is necessary to overcome one\u2019s obstacles, and it is what drives the final factor:Deliberate practice. Practice makes perfect, right? Wrong. There is no perfect. Practice makes permanent. You don\u2019t just practice until you remember/get it right; you practice until you can\u2019t get it wrong. Deliberate practice isn\u2019t just repetition; it\u2019s visualization, specialization, and continued concentration on one\u2019s weaknesses and improving them. A guitarist who is great at chordal playing or scales but not at arpeggios will still practice chords and scales\u2014 but he/she will practice harder at arpeggios until the desired progress is made. Everything that is worth doing requires some practice. Everything that one desires to excel at requires deliberate practice.There is no \u201ctalent.\u201d There are strength, skill, dexterity, nuance, virtuosity\u2014 all of which are gained through work: exposure, enthusiasm, determination, and deliberate practice.  \u2014Alex Krob, an amazing violinist ",

            "answer_text": "I grew up in a classic Asian environment, learning piano and cello. My brother played the violin. For 10 years, all I played were classical pieces, so in my mind, I thought that classical pieces were the hardest to compose and to play. Your fingers had to be quick and agile, and you had to play with feeling and technical perfection. Then, I was exposed to jazz. The improvisation, soul, and emotion jazz artists put into their creations is so so impressive and impossible for me to do; it was infinitely harder than playing classical music. Then, I started learning guitar, and creating music with a group of friends in some kind of rag tag band, and I discovered that rock music too requires a lot of skill. Coordinating with others, singing while playing an instrument, and doing all of that well requires so much skill. I know this is a really vague answer that doesn\u2019t really answer your question, but at least to me, all music genres require a great deal of skill. Except for some pop songs where all the sounds are electronically made and the singing is autotuned\u2026 ",
