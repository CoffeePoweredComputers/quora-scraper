            "answer_text": "I worked in a record store in college back when we still sold vinyl LPs, and a lot of this terminology dates back to vinyl record albums. An EP was shorter/had fewer cuts than an LP (album). A typical pop music album had 10 to 12 songs, and an EP might have 6 songs. LP stands for \u201clong playing\u201d which was important when people were considering purchasing 78 RPM records or 33 1/3 RPM records; the 33 1/3 records played longer and so you had to change platters less often. EP stands for \u201cextended play\u201d when compared to a 45 RPM single. To really blow your mind, the term \u201calbum\u201d when referring to recorded music dates back to a collection of several 78 RPM records that were actually collected together in a book (album).  ",
