            "answer_text": "DAWs, or Digital Audio Workstation\u2019s, in essence, all do the same thing. No program is inherently better than another. Personally, I prefer Logic for tracking audio, Ableton for working with, editing and manipulating audio/MIDI with precision, and FL as my favorite MIDI DAW to quickly crank out ideas. Once upon a time, it is true, that ProTools was the gold standard, and was capable of doing a lot of things other DAWs couldn\u2019t. As of 2019, however, they can all pretty much do the same thing, more or less, though some excel in certain areas. Logic: I love logic for it\u2019s quick and easy ability to create take folders. That is, when recording audio, Logic will easily and automatically create a folder of all the takes for that specific track which you can \u201ccomp\u201d (short for composite) together. It also has a very nice interface for mixing which is intuitive when compared to an analog mixing console. Ableton: Is great for working with looped phrases of audio or MIDI. It began as a tool for use in live DJing and its workflow largely reflects that. The ability to manipulate, edit, tweak, modulate, etc just about any aspect of audio or MIDI in very precise way is what I love about Ableton. FL Studio: I wasn\u2019t a fan of FL for a long time because of its unusual \u201cchannel rack->mixer->playlist\u201d workflow that is quite a bit different than most DAWs and takes some getting used to. That said, the ability to quickly edit MIDI with the numerous functions like \u201cchop\u201d, \u201cstrum\u201d, \u201crandomize\u201d, \u201cstamp\u201d that allow you to produce very humanized/interesting clips with little manual editing. Here\u2019s the bottom line: It doesn\u2019t matter which DAW you choose, it matters that you choose one and stick with it. Like any instrument, you only get good with practice, and by knowing the intricate details of that instrument; DAWs are quite similar. Whichever DAW you do chose, the important thing is to stick with it and learn the ins and outs of the program down to the last detail. And like I said, some have their strong suits, but if you know the finer details of your DAW, you\u2019ll be able to create anything in your \u201cmind\u2019s ear\u201d regardless of what program you choose. It\u2019s about technique, practice, and knowledge NOT about the program. ",

            "answer_text": "That's entirely up to your taste. But my friend tells me a joke that I use FL Studio because I'm not Ableton to use Logic\u2026.(cheesy drum fill sound effect) haha. If you are launching sample clips, better to go with Ableton. If you plan to compose music, I find FL Studio to be super fast and efficient for getting my ideas down. I started FL a long time ago and have tried Reason, Ableton, and seen people work in pro tools and logic. I still choose FL and work in it almost every day. If you would like more details about FL let me know. Since I don't use Ableton I cannot give you an accurate representation. ",
