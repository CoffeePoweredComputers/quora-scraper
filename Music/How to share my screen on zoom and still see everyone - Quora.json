            "answer_text": "The first you need is a very large secondary monitor: 27 inches or larger, which is connected to your computer. I have a 27inch iMac and then I have another 35 inch monitor tethered to it. As Noel says below, once you click on the \u201cshare screen\u201d button, choose whatever window you want to share. All your participants well then get into a small vertical window to the right. You want to switch to \u201cGallery View\u201d which is a button on the top left. You can scale the size of this window. This is why having a huge screen is so important. I drag my shared content to my secondary monitor and then I make the gallery window really large, so I can see all my participants and my content. If you have more than 20 participants in a meeting, it will be difficult to see all of them\u2014there\u2019s nothing you can do about that. ",

            "answer_text": "When you share your screen, select the apps that you want to share from the share menu; example: if you are sharing your PowerPoint, just select the icon with your PowerPoint presentation and click. In your own screen, you will see the PowerPoint in full screen with the Zoom screen of the participant appearing as a PIP (Picture in Picture) on your screen. You could chose the display of the PIP from single participant or double participant at one time. To view more, just scroll down in the PIP. ",
