            "answer_text": "As for any other question about hate that involves the words \u201cfor no reason\u201d attached to it, the answer is only one: ignorance. Those who hate something and can\u2019t give you a logic reason behind their hate never took the time to research the subject of their hate and form an autonomous opinion on it, but most likely just follow the \u201chate train\u201d started by someone who\u2019s just as ignorant on the subject as them, or has ulterior motives to publicize their hate (most of the time financial ones). That\u2019s when you\u2019ll see slogans pushed like gospel that state facts that have been numerous times disproven by scientific research, like \u201cvideo games are a waste of time\u201d. This particular claim has been subject to scientific studies, and have turned out to be not only false, but the opposite of the scientific fact: playing video games keep the brain active, improve reflexes and help stimulate logical thinking ( The Good, Bad, and Ugly of Video Games ).In the end videogames, like everything else, has pros and cons, and like everything else has to be used responsibly. A kid can become aggressive and violent playing violent video games, but that\u2019s why ESRB, PEGI, and all other rating agencies put age restrictions on videogames and basically all media. If you\u2019re a waste of air as a parent and let your 10 years old play Doom, it\u2019s your fault at that point, not the video game\u2019s one. But a kid can also be playing on a swing, fall and split his skull open, yet I never heard anyone organize protests and hating on swings. Why? Because people know swings, know how they work and what are the risks of their use. But they don\u2019t know video games, and it\u2019s way easier to hate than to try and understand them. ",

People who are afraid that it'll turn kids into violent monsters? Or people who hate consoles because they are pc users? Or what? ",
