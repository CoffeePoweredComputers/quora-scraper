            "answer_text": "YouTube users a machine learning algorithm to determine if the views are manipulated. According to Google\u2019s support forum: \u2018\u2019After quality views are counted, view count updates more frequently. The process of including all quality views can take some time depending on a video's popularity and viewership. Afterward, the view count updates more frequently, but keep in mind that we're constantly validating views, so view count can always be adjusted.\u2019\u2019 Refering to frozed views, Google furthur states that: \u2018\u2019On some videos, the view count might seem frozen or not show all the views that you expect. Video views are algorithmically validated to maintain fair and positive experiences for content creators, advertisers, and users. To verify that views are real and accurate, YouTube may temporarily slow down, freeze, or adjust the view count, as well as discard low-quality playbacks.\u2019\u2019  You see Danel Fentone was among the first 1.1 million viwers but the views froze The same IP address refreshing and replaying the video endlessly will be considered as bot and the views deleted. Any behaviour that shows a pattern will de deleted Views under 30 seconds will be deleted Views from multiple tabs will be deleted Views from multiple browsers from the same IP address will be deleted Views on playlists can be attributed to passive listening but these are important marketing tools on non streaming days Fans have suggested to watch \u2018idol\u2019 then 2\u20133 different BTS music videos , Removal of cookies, then repeat. Due to machine learning algorithm which will recognise pattern behaviours, this strategy should be modified each time one is streaming. For example I watched \u2018Idol\u2019 then I watch \u2018DNA\u2019 and \u2018FAKE LOVE\u2019. Next Time I\u2019ll do \u2018Idol\u2019\u2019 then \u2018NOT Today\u2019 and \u2018NO more dream\u2019 or \u2018IDOL\u2019 then \u2018 FOR YOU\u2019 , \u2018BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS\u2019 and \u2018EPIPHANY\u2019. Since Idol sucessfully achieved genuine 45.9 (List of most-viewed online videos in the first 24 hours - Wikipedia) views on its released day, it means that most ARMYs have been able to stream corrently but some ARMY weren\u2019t streaming corrently To guarantee long term viewship of BTS videos( because this, not the 24 hours record is the ultimate goal) , I suggest fans to share the video links or playlists (Google play, amazon music, genie, melon, orion, apply music, spotify, shazam, youtube ect ) on various social platforms and listen on various devices Danel Fentone's answer to Is BTS still dating?

            "answer_text": "Once again, short answers here! Basically, YouTube is doing it\u2019s job, and deletes and will delete views on a video, regardless of who it is, who\u2019s channel it is, who\u2019s in it, and the whole shebang, If they are bought. People will try to buy views for their favorite artists, for their videos to help them move up on charts and get awards, and it\u2019s very common, especially in the world of, you\u2019ve guessed it, K-Pop. Lots of K-Pop fanbases and fansites, even the companies themselves, set these huge goals for their groups, when they release new music. Then, fans run screaming to the polls, buyer sites, streaming platforms, and YouTube, all to try to stream the views and get the numbers up. So, some people try to help, and they end up buying fake views for the video and such, and when YouTube catches them, the fake views get deleted, and they have every right to. Fake views are harmful, and they really take down the whole purpose, as does streaming. Streaming is as much fake as fake views are. If you\u2019re streaming to bulk up numbers, it\u2019s not really fair, because really, one person should only view the video once or twice. Streaming it to reach goals doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re always enjoying it. So, if you\u2019re wondering why BTS\u2019 IDOL or other videos loses views, it\u2019s because the views are fake, and YouTube is actually doing it\u2019s job to keep the records as accurate as possible. (Little personal opinion here, don\u2019t stream. It just amounts to a lot of views that aren\u2019t real, and it undermines the whole purpose of finding out how many people have watched it. Like, really.) ",
