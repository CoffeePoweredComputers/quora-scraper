            "answer_text": "Musicians pay 9.1 cents for each CD they press, release or each download, plus a smaller fee for streaming. These are paid to the publisher. Sometimes a minimum is asked for like 1,000 ($91 per song). You have to negotiate with the publisher or in America you can use the U.S. Copyright office. You also have to make regular accountings, post the publisher name and song writer names with the title of the song on your CDs and singles. Musicians do not received royalties for cover songs. Only publishers and song writers. Musicians get royalties off sales of their own albums. If you record a CD with 10 cover songs you may have to pay a minimum of $910 to the various publishers UP FRONT for the first 1,000 CDs or downloads. You have to give the store 40\u201350% of retail price. You have to give distributors like Ingram 60\u201365% of retail. The record label gets the rest so from a $12 CD you leave at a store you might get $6 and 91 cents of that was paid to the songwriters/publishers up front. Of the $5.09 that\u2019s left you have to deduct how much it cost to make the CD which can vary from 35 cents if you burn it yourself on bulk disks, put a paper label on it, put it in a jewel case to $1.40 to have it made professionally in quantities of 1,000. $3.69 is left. If you had to pay a studio to record the 10 songs you need to amortize that into this figure. If you recorded it at home then this is your net profit. The BAND makes a royalty off this. Generally and artist gets about 7% off retail and a producer gets 2%. That\u2019s about 82 cents for the recording artist. That leaves $2.82 for the record label. If the band splits equally then a 4 member band each member gets 92 cents off each CD or download SOLD and PAID FOR from stores. If you sell out of the trunk of your car you make more money. If it cost you $2,000 to record the 10 songs then $2 per CD or Download goes to repay that up front investment and that leaves $1.69 net profit which gets distributed to the act (7% or 82 cents) or split 4 ways (43 cents). If you are on a major label and got a $250,000 advance then 300,000 CDs or downloads have to sell before you see ONE cent of royalties. ",

            "answer_text": "Be aware, all of the layers of licensing are difficult to navigate, and just as hard to negotiate if you want to make and distribute a recording. More so if a video is involved. This is why a business manager or agent is invaluable for creatives. Knowing all of the legal requirements can be a big burden on those whose talents like in creating art. But a summary: Live performance of covers (and originals, for that matter), is covered under the license the venue needs to get to have live performances. So not a worry for the performer. Audio recordings need to get licenses from songwriter. Fortunately there is a compulsory scheme in most countries where you just contact BMI, ASCAP, or the Harry Fox Agency and pay an upfront fee for the number of copies you make. As said above, working with someone that has done this before is useful. Making a video that uses someone\u2019s song, requires case-by-case negotiation for a synchronization license. For this you would definitely want a business manager or entertainment lawyer. ",
