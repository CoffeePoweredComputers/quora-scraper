            "answer_text": "I love to sing so much that I miss it when I go away to uni. It\u2019s not singing by myself that I like, you see. It\u2019s singing with my family. Sometimes one of us will start singing a song that we all know, like \u2018Yellow Bird\u2019 or \u2018In the Jungle\u2019 or \u2018Amazing Grace\u2019 and the others will join in on the harmony. My sister sings the main tune, usually, and my other sister does the mid-range harmony whilst I do the high bits and our dad sings low-range, even though I should swap with my sister because my voice is deeper than hers, and sometimes someone will take up the piano or the guitar parts\u2026 In the car it\u2019s the best. We\u2019ll have the CD that we all know and we\u2019ll sing ad-lib harmonies (sometimes dubious) to all the pieces we like, and sometimes I\u2019ll doze and listen to them, and sometimes we\u2019ll all belt out the main tune because we\u2019re alone on a country road or we\u2019re going down a motorway in the dark and that\u2019s just what you should do at those times. My sister\u2019s friend said that he likes to play the piano and let us sing to it because it makes him feel like he\u2019s in Little Women. I don\u2019t know why people are so reluctant to sing with people. Maybe people can\u2019t sing perfectly. I can\u2019t. Maybe they\u2019re afraid of messing up. I do. But it\u2019s sad to be on a coach for two hours with your friends and it\u2019s entirely songless the whole way, even if there are songs to which you\u2019d all know the words. ",

I\u2019ll say this, the majority of those I knew think positively on my voice so I\u2019m not trying to say I sing carelessly. And the positive feedback I\u2019ve gotten, having the ability to sing almost any song I desire, and liking how I sound overall are the reasons why I like to sing over all other things I practice. ",

I sing when I am playing piano, I sing in the car, and I sing at home. I don\u2019t sing at school though, because I don\u2019t really like singing in front of people that aren\u2019t my family. They make a big deal about it because they are suprised that I can actually sing. They think that I\u2019m just a nerd. ",
