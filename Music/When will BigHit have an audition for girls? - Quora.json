            "answer_text": "Definitely not anytime soon (like for around 7\u201310 years? Or never). BigHit used to have a girl group named Glam nearly a decade ago that disbanded due to a bunch of scandals. They probably don\u2019t want to deal with that again. Girl groups are also generally not as popular as boy groups, mostly because the majority of the K-pop fanbase are girls. From what I see, BigHit seems to have a special formula for the boy groups that allows them to be more successful. Girl groups also tend to get more hate than boy groups about their image, so I feel like Bighit doesn\u2019t want to deal with that. (Idk, that might just be me though.) Lastly (I personally think this is the biggest reason), BigHit doesn\u2019t want to deal with the fangirls. Think about it, if you want to try out, are you doing it because you want to dance for 8+ hours per day, sing until your voice breaks, and diet until you are skinny as a stick, or do you just want to be acquainted with BTS? Idk about you, but I\u2019d go with the second option. However, BigHit want actual talent and pure determination, not desperate saesang girls who want to \u201cbe near their oppas\u201d and get attention. While I\u2019m sure there are plenty of girls who actually want to work hard and become an idol and don\u2019t care too much about BTS, it\u2019s just too risky. Dang it, BigHit is smart. There goes all my plans. ",

If they ever decide to have a girl group in the future, they will more than likely borrow or outsource from other companies. From what I understand, they\u2019ve been training boy groups for the past 5 or so years solely, so they probably wouldn\u2019t even have the accommodations for girl groups. I doubt they would be mixing girls into their boy dorms. If they ever have an audition I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be making it public to let everyone know. But I don\u2019t think bighit will be taking female trainees anytime soon. ",
