            "answer_text": "Music bands are something not many people in India have any knowledge about or care about. But then, in this journey of search for good music, I have come across some of the best bands which I will like to name- My fav has to be Agnee. It has some of the most beautiful songs I have ever come across in my 22 years of life. Mohan Kanan has one of the most unique and lovable voice and I love him like crazy. Aahatein is my all time favourite companion.Next up is Swastik the band. Not many know about it but go and search YouTube and listen to their numbers like Kuch bhi and Nadiya ke paar. Soulful is the word for them.Bombay Vikings. Needs no introduction. Their lead, Neeraj Shreedhar is still very much around.Sanam. The band of the famous Sanam Puri. Songs like Behka and Tumse were a must for me some years back.Silk Route. It takes something to churn out melodies the way Mohit Chauhan does. He is simply the best. And it all started with Silk Route in 1995.Deepak Rathore Project - Their lead, Deepak Rathore has sung some amazing solos and Shimla tha Ghar is as close to me as it can be.The Local Train - Who doesn't love The Local Train? I was introduced very late to these gem of a band and consider myself lucky to have known them. There are innumerable tracks that I love and you must listen to their album Aalas ke Ped and Choo Lo is the song that made them famous. Most of their tracks are pretty much very listenable.This is all I could find. Special Mention- Aryans. They were very popular years back and have some good songs. Revisiting this answer. Have edited some material and added in. Thank you. AJ! !!! ! ",
