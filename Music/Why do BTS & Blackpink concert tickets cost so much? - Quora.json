            "answer_text": "To begin with\u2026Big Hit has to rent the venue, hire security staff, ship all their equipment and special effects from Korea. (Have you heard about tariffs charged by government when shipping goods across international borders?). They have seven members and a slew of back up dancers, crew to operate the equipment, stylists, choreographers, physical therapists and medical personnel to treat BTS, hotel rooms, transportation for the staff, paid publicity, city taxes, county taxes, state taxes, permits for the event, permits and fees to be paid to block off streets leading to the venue, the cost of hiring police (yes, police are paid OVERTIME to work at events to protect you) to control traffic and provide security at the venue. Hey, have you seen the videos? BTS has awesome special effects\u2026can\u2019t get those at Party City or the Dollar Tree. So\u2026.you add up all those COSTS, add a reasonable profit margin (no one works for free, not even you) and divide it by the number of projected attendees (no matter how popular you think you are, you cannot plan on selling out a venue) and there you get your ticket costs. But, oh wait, we forgot about the tickets given away by magazines, vendors, radio stations, etc. Those may be \u201cfree\u201d to the winner, but the cost of those tickets are paid by everyone who actually paid to attend. Add up all the costs, add a reasonable profit (money to Namjoon, Yoongi, etc.), divide by 90,000 and there you are. Rent a hall and plan a party for your friends and even if you do it on the cheap (Party City, Dollar Tree, Walmart), you will quickly see how quickly the money leaves your wallet. Then, consider how much you have to charge your friends to attend your party so you make your money back and just a little bit more. Ah, economics is a blast. ",

            "answer_text": "Black pink I don\u2019t know honestly, they can\u2019t even sell them and people resold their BP tickets for BTS so not sure. BTS concerts- this is the one I can answer. They bring everything over from korea, their additional screens like for the love yourself tour, the extendable screens in the BTS logo and their lighting and sound systems. No wonder, it would cost A LOT of money to ship these over. So add these and base costs from what they need to give back to the venue and also pay to artists and staff, it tends to work out.. Also the demand for BTS concerts is incredibly high! Although I still think, the tickets are quite alright priced, expensive but not too bad. They sold out Wembley Stadium, London (90,000 capacity) within 1h30 so they\u2019ve added a second date, now get that.. ",
