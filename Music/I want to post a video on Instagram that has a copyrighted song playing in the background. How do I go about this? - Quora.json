            "answer_text": "If its just your personal account and not a business account, it can be used at any time. If you\u2019re not profiting financially from the songs use, then they can\u2019t claim copyright infringement because there\u2019s no equity gained for doing so. So they wouldn\u2019t be allowed to sue you for it. If your instagram account is for a business your advertising for with your posts, then you have to find the proper information about doing that. Some people won\u2019t make you do anything by contacting them, like on youtube they will just give you a notification as you\u2019re uploading said video, that they are claiming whatever percentage of the copyrights and then BMI will collect it for them unless you pay them directly for any compromise you agree with. You may have to pick a different song if the plan is to make money off of it or the owner had signed a deal with the company of the website to not allowed any use of the song without their permission even after purchasing it on like itunes or something. If you\u2019re worried about it a lot then just contact their team directly if you can or through finding someone to help you at a organization that will help you find the answers you need like BMI or ASCAP. If you have to pay any royalties for the song you used and gained income from, it usually will just be sent straight to them before you get your hands on any of the money from like youtube. Or maybe instagram too I\u2019m not too sure about their terms. If you\u2019re selling merchandise or playing live for profit, as say a cover perform might in some cases, then find out how to get a licensing agreement with the owner of the song first because they might let you have some of your income you work for before taking any royalties for some things and not others. It might come at a cost to receive the license although. Famous people will usually ask for a lot if they\u2019re strict about where their music is used for someone who may in a way represent their image somehow. ",

            "answer_text": "You can either remove the copyrighted audio background song or get permission. To remove it, use video editing software to edit or remove the audio (or you can swap it out with another copyright-released or public domain track). There are lots of options for free music you can use instead which either contains no copyright or has been licensed for such uses (for example, Narrator Tracks, Bensound.com, Purple Planet Music, AudioBlocks, etc., as well as a couple of YouTube channels which specialize in this; also Creative Commons). To get permission, contact the rights owner. Typically that\u2019s the artist or individual who produced it, but if it\u2019s an artist or band represented by a label (and not a local individual), they probably have a rights management or permissions division of the record label on their website. If it\u2019s an individual, you can often reach them directly through their YouTube channel or Instagram account. If the soundtrack is essential to appreciating the video, then your only real option is to get permission. See Instagram\u2019s own explanation on this, too: How can I make sure the content I post to Instagram doesn't violate copyright law? - - - - - NOTE: YouTube offers an option for voluntarily having their upload utility swap out the audio to avoid infringement, but I\u2019m not aware of any feature like that for Instagram.
