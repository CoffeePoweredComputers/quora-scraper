            "answer_text": "Folk songs are important for many reasons.(1.) First of all it tunes down the complexity of modern instrumentation and takes it back to basics; just a guy/gal and his/her guitar. Folk music is important for this reason, it gives the artist an ability to focus on just honing his/her skills on just a couple instruments. Like the Banjo and Guitar, the mandolin and the Lute. It takes it down from all of the hustle and bustle of the world and takes it right back to nature. In fact, a lot of Folk bands par se, Angus and Julia Stone, The Head and the Heart, Sufjan Stevens, and Bon Iver, are Neo-Romanticists. People that really love nature, and everything in it. The (2) second reason that folk is important, is because it gets you back to your roots. Here in America it is hard for this diverse society to find its roots, and people oft don\u2019t want to find them. But unfortunately, Folk is primarily made up of white Americans, just as the country was at its origin. So racially this genre is divided. Now I\u2019m not saying black people cant make Folk music, I\u2019m just saying they have a different folk music, that traces back to their roots. It\u2019s all about the roots. In Louisiana, Jazz music is the Folk music of the region. Folk music can take many forms, but holistically, it is all music without synthesizers. Reason (3) deals with Folk music on a global scale. Folk music has been around since country\u2019s gained their independence. So all nations have Folk music. There\u2019s Irish Folk music (which I love), Scottish folk music, just put any country before the two words \u201cfolk\u201d and \u201cmusic\u201d and T.S. a reality. In other cultures people would oft tell stories through song. The Hebrew people would tell of David\u2019s fleeing from Saul in the Psalms, and they\u2019d sing those Psalms as Folk Songs. The genre of Folk is extremely broad and spans every generation of the earth. That is why, Folk music is very instrumental in the way it used today. That is also why I love it so much, and you should love it too. It tells a history story. ",

            "answer_text": "The value of folk songs\u2026 Folk songs tell stories. And they often tell stories about society in parable form, similar to how Jesus used parables, stories, to tell and teach upon moral and ethical issues, even spiritual things. Just listen to \u201cThis Land Is Your Land\u201d by Woodie Guthrie. Actually listen to it. What is it saying to you? Listen to \u201cTom Dooley\u201d by the Kingston Trio. Actually listen to it. What is it saying to you? What is the story? Listen to \u201cBlowin\u2019 In The Wind\u201d. And this is just three songs. Yes, they are from days past. But these songs came out and became popular during the folk renaissance of the late 1950s into the early 1960s. Folk songs are often a mirror into which we can look and see ourselves, individually and as a society. They tell compelling stories, something a lot of music today has forgotten how to do. And they are memorable because they speak to our heart, not just our senses. They remind us of where we came from, who we are, where we may be going. And they warn us of the possible consequences if we don\u2019t pay attention to our intentions. ",
