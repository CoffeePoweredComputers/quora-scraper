            "answer_text": "Garageband has multitrack recording. It is a reasonably good DAW. Reaper has more capability though.In my experience you get better latency on a Mac than PC and Garageband doesn't glitch halfway through the best solo you've ever played.To use a gaming analogy: Macs are like Nintendos - you plug them in and they work without you having to educate yourself to PhD level to get the best out of them, whereas PCs are like PCs and sometimes things don't work right so you have to spend the rest of the night searching through forums for solutions. Sometimes there is no solution either and you just have to live with it.Macs feel solid and reliable while PCs feel like they're on the verge of falling over the whole time. Computers suck for multitrack recording unless you're willing to spend loads and buy some of the same equipment you'd need to buy if you were just using a dedicated multi-track recorder instead. Musicians are crippled by latency. If you're trying to play in time then \"now\" needs to be now, not 40 ms ago. ",

            "answer_text": "Garageband would be considered a multitrack DAW. While I\u2019m hesitant to say it can do \u201ceverything\u201d Reaper can do, it can certainly do a lot. If you are new to DAWs or audio recording in general, it can be a great place to start. To create additional tracks, just click the + button at the top of the track column. Each time you click this + sign, you will be asked what kind of new track you would like to create. This may vary depending on the version of Garageband you are using, but it usually asks \u201cAudio,\u201d \u201cSoftware,\u201d or \u201cDrummer.\u201d Hope that helps, happy recording!  ",
