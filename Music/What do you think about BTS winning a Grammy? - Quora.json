            "answer_text": "I'm not really someone who keeps up with the Grammy awards each year so I can't really tell you exactly what's going to happen at the award show this year. But, I heard that BTS is nominated for the best album packaging and here's my thoughts about it. BTS Album Earns 2019 Grammy Nomination: Here's Why It's Important Now let me get to your question, I think that BTS has a chance to win the award in that certain category but not in other main categories. The reason why I think that BTS will be able to win the album packaging category and as to how and why they deserve to win in the album packaging category is mainly because BTS or any Kpop artists actually have better album packaging than any American artist. Kpop artists are usually more creative in their album packages than American artists as the American artists don't usually care for their album packaging. Besides, most Americans fans like to download or buy songs online through iTunes and such. However, I think that's probably much it to how many awards the Grammy will give to them this year. I personally don't think that they deserve to win any Grammy award in other categories just YET because if you actually look at all of the American artists, there is actually a lot more better and well deserved artists out there than BTS themselves. BTS may seem like they've done a big impact in the music industry which is true because getting big from a small company like Big Hit while being a Kpop band from South Korea wasn't easy. But if you look at it at a bigger aspects, BTS seem to be lacking more than some of the other artists in the American industry. Besides, I think that it's too soon if they win a Grammy considering the fact that their songs aren't a big of a hit in the US compared to other big artists. BTS winning a Grammy is also kind of like a funny idea because they haven't really won any other awards in the US which is actually based on their musicality. They've won Top Social Artist at BBMAS two times now but does that even have anything to do with their talents in producing music? No. So yeah, I don't think that they should win a Grammy yet in terms of other main categories but having them to win best album packaging is pretty good though it may have seem like the award organizer just wanted BTS to come to their show for ratings and views.

            "answer_text": "Grammy away is decided by experts. Its unlikely BTS will ever win grammy award especially with current type of Music they make. Yes they can win awards like teen awards because they are decided by fans not by people having greatknowledge aqnd understanding of Music. I am not saying all fans don't have knowledge but its true most fans will vote for their favorite artists irrespective of their song or album is best in terms of Music. I know some fans of BTS think its the best band currently. Yes its their opinion and I cannot hate them for that. But truth is in terms of Music and song writing and singing, they are not the best. There is difference between being popular and best best.Most experts of music don't consider them best. Its not just grammy, but there are many other lists of best albums or best songs made by music critcs and experts and they don't say bts have best albun. Pazz and Jop poll is one of the most prestigious list of best songs and albums made every year. Its decided by experts. In 2018, Golden hour by Kacey topped list of best album. It is also the same album that won the grammy. BTS love yourself tear was included among top 100 but it was ranked Bts is currently very popular among teen girls but its not the first band or movie or singer to have done thaT. In past many other artists/movies like backstreet boys, nsync,jonas brothers, titanic, twiligh, menudo, david cassidy, justin bieber, one direction, new kids of the block, the monkeeys , the beatles,westlife, take that,elvis presley, frank sinatra etc who were extremely popular among teen girls and probably vreated mass hysteria way more than bts, but many of them disappear...some are still popular like the beatles,elvis because later they got fans from different ages and they made amazing music... life span of bands or artists popular among teen girls is usually very short. when teenage girls grow usually their obsession of celebrities goes away...now i am not saying only teenage girls are fan of bts but most of the fans are.....so its unlikely bts will be popular or number 1 after couple of years..Z also i never really understand so much worship of celebrities...they arehuman beings..they are doing their jobs just like others do like doctors, engineers...but some people are really obsessed of celebrities as if they zare everything ",
