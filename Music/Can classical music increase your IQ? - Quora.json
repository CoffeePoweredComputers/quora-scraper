            "answer_text": "Classical music may or may not increase your IQ but it definitely expands your range of thinking. Whether you are listening, composing, or playing classical music your mind can be relaxed, excited, or doggedly determined. If your IQ doesn\u2019t expand it surely rattles the cage. When I wanted to improve my fingerpicking technique, I bought some classical music books. When I could play simple Bach tunes I felt that my brain was expanding. My fingerpicking technique improved immensely and my fear of classical music evolved into a thirst for the art. I am by no means a great guitarist but classical music gave an alternate playground for my mind. I didn\u2019t go for an IQ test to see if my IQ increased but the experience definitely shook the status quo of my complacency. I had to play some rock and blues until my mind settled. Good question!
