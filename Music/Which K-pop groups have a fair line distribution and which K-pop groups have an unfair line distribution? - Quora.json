            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. I think it depends on the Entertainment Company. For Example, BTS and the likes under Big Hit Entertainment have their song time fairly distributed, based on the roles they play in the song. E.g.BTS' Spring Day (Studio Ver.) which lasted about 4 minutes and 34 seconds (approx.), we had: \u2022Jungkook - 45 sec\u2022V - 45 sec \u2022Jin - 34 sec \u2022Rap Monster - 31 sec \u2022Jimin - 28 sec \u2022Suga - 15 sec \u2022J-Hope - 0 sec I know I know, J-Hope has 0 seconds, and you wonder why I call it fairly distributed. The style of the song didn't need his expertise, and if he sang anything, it'll probably not appeal to the song. For someone named J-Hope, he sure had No-Hope in getting a part in the song (lol). Then AOA.... I believe is unfair... Look at their distribution:AOA - Oh BOY (3:30) \u2022Choa - 1 min 10 sec\u2022Yuna - 23 sec\u2022Hyejeong - 23 sec\u2022Seolhyun - 21 sec\u2022Jimin - 17 sec\u2022Mina - 7 sec\u2022Chanmi - 7 sec 7 seconds!!! seven friking seconds! And Choa get's 70 seconds... that's even if it were correctly calculated. Does this mean Choa is 10 times better than ChanMi (of course I'm kidding!)? Because she sure had 10 times the time. Even Seohyun that had A LOT of screen time, had 21 seconds. I understand that Choa is kinda like the lead artist, next to Jimin.... but really. The gap is way too much. She sang close to 1/3rd of the entire song.... not to include the small scenes where it's just instrumental playing. In my opinion, it's unfair. My judgement is in no way affected by my respect for ChanMi, but really........ I know you might think ChanMi (and Mina)'s 7 seconds were better than J-Hope's 0 seconds, but it's better you're not doing anything at all, than to do something, but not do enough due to limited time.But it doesn't matter. It's still entertainment and we are still pleased to see their art style.... even if it's just for 7 seconds. ",

            "answer_text": "Tons of them have unfair line distributions. Here're some general ones: BTS: Jungkook usually gets the most while Jin gets the least Seventeen: More for Woozi, DK and Seungkwan, with Jun, The8, Wonwoo and Joshua usually in the bottom Astro: Heavily relies on Moonbin and MJ\u2019s vocals Btob: Peniel usually gets a lot fewer lines than others SF9: no specific pattern, but mostly unfair. Well, at least the are unfair fairly: for example, some songs are Taeyang biased, but in the next he might have one if the fewest lines Stray Kids: Han and Changbin usually get more lines. EXID: Extremely biased towards LE. Dreamcatcher: Gahyeon and Handong are always in the bottom. (G)I-DLE: Heavily dependant on Soyeon and Soojin while Shuhua is being ditched So far I've seen two songs with nearly perfect line distribution: BTS - Mic Drop  Astro - Always You  ",

The worst I think are either Weki Meki or WJSN. With Weki Meki, their debut gave the two IOI members and their main vocal like 30 seconds of lines and the two girls at the bottom had like 4 and 6 respectively (their comeback La La La is better though, and it\u2019s also a bop go listen let me hype my girls). WJSN has 13 members and 1 rapper, so you can see how the rapper gets a lot of lines, but they also have like 4 or 5 \u201cmain vocals\u201d and only 2 of them really get substantial lines. Yeonjung, Seola, and Exy generally get the most while Meiqi, Cheng Xiao, Xuanyi, Luda, and Yeoreum barely get any. Their most recent comeback, Dream Your Dream, looks like a bad line distribution but tbh it\u2019s probably the fairest one they\u2019ve had so far in their ~2 years of promoting. ",

I'm fine with Mia getting the most lines, because she's main vocalist. I was actually fine with their title tracks more than some of their other songs. Dun Dun was way fairer than this:  This is just unfair because other members could've pulled off some of those lines. I could see it. Sistar and 2ne1 had some bad line distributions too.  None of these line distributions belong to me. ",

But that doesn't mean that they are favouring a particular member or ignoring the other one. See, in every group all the members are good at different things, few are better at singing than the others or few are better in dancing than the others or one can simply be a better visual. Taking all these plus points of the members a song is usually created in such a way that the exposure to all the members are equal but in different senses. All the members are promoted in a different and unique way. So to say the line distribution is unfair will be rude, but yeah it is uneven for good. ",
