            "answer_text": "Now this is a tough question to answer, all these rappers are more talented then the other in different areas of hiphop. To make it a little easier i think we can remove Snoop and DMX from the argument. While they are both skilled emcee\u2019s and legendary pioneers of in the rap game, they cant quiet hold a candle to the skill Eminem, Jay or Ye bring to the table. Now this is where it gets difficult. Eminem, Jay-Z and Kanye West are all ridiculously talented, and kind of the figure heads of what hiphop is to people outside of the community. All 3 are constantly brought up in peoples top 10 rapper lists and greatest of all time arguments. If what you mean by \u201cmost talented\u201d is who is the best rapper and nothing else then that kinda makes it hard for me to recommend Kanye. While he is a very skilled and unique rapper he can\u2019t compete with jay or em in fact it wouldn\u2019t even be close if he tried to. So ill leave Kanye out of the conversation for now. Now there are many aspects that make up being the best rapper so I\u2019ll brake them up into bullet points. LyricsThis hands down has to go to Jay. While Eminem is no lyrical slouch, in fact far from it, his story telling ability and punch lines are better then Jay\u2019s but in every other lyrical aspect i have to give it to Jay-z. The way Jay uses word play in his songs is incredible and adds so many layers and hidden meanings to his songs. His lyrics are what put him in the greatest of all time conversation. the only rappers he\u2019s in competition with lyrically, (Nas, Mos-Def, Lupe, black Thought) he out does in other aspects that make a rapper great.FlowThis ones a little more difficult to decide as i believe its a little more subjective. both rappers have amazing flows and are very hard to compare. Jay has a slower, more laid back flow, while Em\u2019s is much more aggressive and at times stupidly fast paced (i think we\u2019ve all heard rap god). I think Jays flow lends its self better to the way he uses he\u2019s lyrics. On surface leave it seems like a simplistic flow but i believe that is purposely done to allow listeners to catch the clever word play he uses. He\u2019s capable of a using a faster flow, if you go back and listen to his stuff pre \u2018Reasonable Doubt\u2019 you\u2019ll heard it but he limits himself for his audience. This i believe gives Eminem the upper hand, he\u2019s able to fire off crazy aggressive flows when he wants but he can also do a slow paced flow (like Jay) for more lyrical focused songs like \u2018Stan\u2019 or \u2018mockingbird\u2019. because of this I\u2019d say Eminem has the better flow.DiscographyWhile their discography doesn\u2019t directly represent their talent as a rapper, it shows their song writing skills which i believe is a very important part of this discussion. you can rap all you want but if it doesn't translate into a good song then there isn't a lot of point outside of a freestyle on \u2018Sway in the morning\u2019 or a \u2018BET cypher\u2019. So both rappers have amazing classic albums under their respective belts. Eminem\u2019s got SSLP, MMLP and The Eminem Show. For Jay-Z its Reasonable Doubt, The Blueprint, The Black Album and arguably American Gangster and 4:44. Right away we can see that Jay has more classics in his collection but that isn't exactly a fair assessment as jay has a total of 13 albums while Em only has 10. It really comes down to the overall quality of all their albums, and i\u2019m sorry to say that its strongly in Jay-Z\u2019s favour. apart from Eminem\u2019s classic albums i mentioned id say the rest are all sub-par. There is an argument to be made that recovery and kamikaze are decent but I\u2019d still say they\u2019re disappointing albums, especially coming from someone like Eminem. Jay on the other hand has amazing albums still left in his collection if you removed his classics. Theres his in my life time series, 3 amazing albums that id personally call classics. Even his albums that are considered sub-par for him still gave us some great songs, like \u2018Empire State of mind\u2019 from the dumpster fire that is \u2018The Blueprint 3\u2019. so obviously Jay-z has the bester discography.There are things i\u2019ve left out like how technical they\u2019re rapping is because i believe it wouldn't change the out come. So I\u2019d say Jay-Z takes the cake as the most talented rapper between him and Eminem. but what about Kanye West? Kanye\u2019s talent as a pure rapper may not shine as bright as Jay-Z\u2019s but he has other talents that i believe elevate him has a rapper far above what Jay-Z could ever be. Kanye\u2019s incredible ear for beat making and what i can only describe as genius level creativity combined with with his rapping make him a force in hip hop that can not be stopped. He is constantly innovating and reinventing the genre, pushing forward with every album. He is a true artist in every sense of the word. So if what you were after is who is the most talented artist at rapping then its Jay-Z but if you wanted to know who is the most talented Artist in the rap game then its by far Kanye West. No one even really comes close. (If you wanted to know who was best out of Snoop and DMX, I\u2019d say Snoop. He\u2019s got better albums, lyrics and flow. He\u2019s also had better longevity and is more interesting to listen to. For me, DMX\u2019s music is cool but all i get out of now is a really fun and loud car ride.) ",
