            "answer_text": "One focus will make you a one sided singer. However, you\u2019ve got to start somewhere, so I\u2019d start with your own assessment. Record yourself singing for a minute and ask yourself what you liked about it, and what you\u2019d like to hear improved most. Then focus on that element for the next little bit. Then, rinse and repeat. I think this could be particularly helpful for most people as a) every singer is different and needs different advice, and b) every singer\u2019s goals are different and therefore, in a way, you are one of the best people to say what direction you need to go. I hope that helps and makes sense :) ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s probably worth your time trying to choose a style or genre to settle into for your singing practice. Singing is quite different for each style, so once you have a specific genre, look at what others are doing within that style. Record your own voice and see what will need most improvement for your voice to match that style. It\u2019s worth noting that most singers tend to have a natural tone quality which suits certain genres. After years of trying different genres as a back up singer, I found my voice as a lead rock singer. It\u2019s a lot of jumping around on stage while playing an instrument. So my practices include lots of breath and some tone control. JD ",
