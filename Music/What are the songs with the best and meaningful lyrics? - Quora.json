            "answer_text": "My personal favorite - Time by Pink Floyd. This song beautifully talks about how we waste time in our youth(\"You are young and life is long, and there is time to kill today\") and how we live to regret this later(\"And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but its sinking\")    Amazingly deep lyrics. And as a bonus, some great guitar solos! ",
