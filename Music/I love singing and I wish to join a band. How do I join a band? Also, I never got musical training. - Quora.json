            "answer_text": "In general, you don\u2019t join a band, you form one - usually with a few friends. And then you write a few songs, perhaps play in a local competition or in\u2026 your school or something. Maybe you play a few gigs. Then the band breaks up. At least, that\u2019s how it works for most amateur/hobby musicians. Sometimes someone leaves a band and there\u2019s a vacancy, and then someone may join the band and take their place. ehh. So basically just find people to jam with. And find a place to jam. That\u2019s pretty important. Somewhere you can be really loud and not get noise complaints. Maybe if there\u2019s a competition coming up in a few months and you don\u2019t have a bass player, you put out an ad: \u201cWanted, bassist for our alt-rock band, stoned octopus. Must own a bass guitar.\u201d Try it. It\u2019s fun. ",

            "answer_text": "Band is not a company that one joins. It is a group of like minded people who decide to stick together to make and perform music. I think you must start by being a singer/songwriter. A singer/ songwriter sings songs composed and written by him or her. If you can write good songs and sing them well then automatically musicians would be interested in playing with you. You need some basic training at least to understand music. So I recommend you get some lessons in the kind of singing you want to do. ",
