            "answer_text": "They are the same note but in different octaves. A typical guitar is not quite two octaves, 21\u201322 frets and would need 24 frets to make two octaves. The strings are tuned in 5ths, (five note tones between strings). This rule does not apply to the the 3rd string \u201cG\u201d as this is only four tones from B. However, the remaining strings are tuned in 5ths from G down to E. When you first learn to play open chords, you realize that barre chords are basically movable up the neck of the guitar from the open position. It is generally easier to play songs written in sharp keys on guitar versus Flat Keys that are used to write most traditional keyboard music. Most scales are combinations of strings top to bottom such as 1\u20133; 1\u20133; 1\u20133; 1\u20133\u20134; and 1\u20133\u20134 Other scales will start 1\u20133\u20134; 1\u20133\u20134; 1\u20133; 1\u20133; and 1\u20133\u20134. Then there are added notes as some songs will have melody notes that are flat or sharp. You will often see a note written in sheet music that indicates to play it sharped from its normal value. However, in sharp keys the staff will have indications which notes in the scale are to be played sharpe, so a double sharp note is now natural, confusing. C is the only key where no notes are sharp or flat. In playing instrumentals if you can find the root note for the key of the song you can play around with the above patterns and after awhile you will hear notes that need to be played sharp to sound correct. However, once things get into Flat Keys, I get confused. Those dots on the guitar are quite helpful at getting you to the correct place. Guitar players after playing for awhile look at a guitar chord on the written music and only think about what dot location to move their left hand. There are lots of tricks especially for playing electric. ",

            "answer_text": "If you think of it in terms of frequencies, the high E vibrates at exactly 4 times the number of cycles per second as the low E because it is 2 octaves higher (82.4 Hz x 2 for one octave, then x 2 again = 329.6 Hz). Because the frequencies are exactly doubled like this, the notes sound the same in a fundamental way, and we call them both \"E.\" The thickness, density and tension of the string all contribute to the frequency at which it vibrates. String dynamics is a very interesting and relevant area of physics for guitarists. ",
