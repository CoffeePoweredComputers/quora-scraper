            "answer_text": "The purpose is message-making. The vehicle of performance art itself is an interdisciplinary one, combining whichever mediums required to present the intended messages. Due to the wide umbrella of this category of live presentation, a single performance art presentation can take many forms, and can also be varied within it\u2019s own structure. A piece can be as literal or non-linear as the performer(s) choose it to be. You ask specifically about purpose; and I would say that this genre of live craft has as many purposes as any piece of music, theater, dance, storytelling, film, dance or poem. What makes this so special and specialized is its flexibility, combining any and every possible artistic expression - the world of possibilities is limited by the creator - and the myriad choices are left to one\u2019s editing the broad cache of ideas into one effective package that is capable of communicating what the artist-in-question wants to impart to the viewer. Some would say that performance art got its start a little over 100 years ago in various cities in Europe, as a reaction to certain regimes. It was a new form of rebellion to galvanize people to action against repression. ",

            "answer_text": "The arts enrich life. In performing arts, the audience can vicariously experience the situations and physicality portrayed on stage, and this can allow the viewer to understand another viewpoint that he/she might not otherwise comprehend. The performing arts allows a broadening of the perspectives of life beyond the daily grind. It can expand your personal space, allows you to be transported to a place in your mind that you might only have dreamed of, and allows you to escape your problems. You can admire the performer\u2019s expertise in his portrayal of a character, drool over a beautiful voice in an opera, gasp at the graceful physical feats of a dancer and be absorbed into the world a play depicts\u2026 the acoustics of a symphony hall cannot be experienced in a living room, no matter how good a sound system is, and the interaction of the actor and audience never happens at home in front of a TV. As a professional dancer, I don\u2019t think an audience of today realizes how much their presence affects the performance. In this day and age of the internet, one thinks that everything is available there. But a live performance is truly a meeting of one human directly with another. There is no substitute for that type of communication. ",
