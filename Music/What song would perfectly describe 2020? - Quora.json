It sometimes makes me cry from inside for what are we doing with our beautiful world.\ud83d\ude22 I don't think there's a more accurate song than this for current status of Earth. LYRICS: All we knowLeft untoldBeaten by a broken dreamNothing like what it used to be (used to be) We've been chasing our demons down an empty roadBeen watching our castle turning into dustEscaping our shadows just to end up hereOnce moreAnd we both know This is not the world we had in mindBut we got timeWe are stuck on answers we can't findBut we got timeAnd even though we might have lost tonightThe skyline reminds us of a different timeThis is not the world we had in mindBut we got time Broken smile, tired eyesI can feel your longing heartCall my name, howling from afar We've been fighting our demons just to stay afloatBeen building a castle just to watch it fallBeen running forever just to end up hereOnce moreAnd now we know This is not the world we had in mindBut we got timeWe are stuck on answers we can't findBut we got timeAnd even though we might have lost tonightThe skyline reminds us of a different timeThis is not the world we had in mindBut we got time Take me backBack to the mountainsideUnder the Northern LightsChasing the starsTake me backBack to the mountainsideWhen we were full of lifeBack to the startAnd we both know that This is not the world we had in mindBut we got timeWe are stuck on answers we can't findBut we got timeAnd even though we might have lost tonightThe skyline reminds us of a different timeThis is not the world we had in mindBut we got time ",
