            "answer_text": "Wow! No. These questions I tell you..this question shows me people dnt listen to the interviews. People might want to before they ask these questions. Lil Wayne already said numerous times which rapper he would call out but he knows he can't mess with and besides he begged this rapper to do an album with him during same interview. Does that sound like somebody who truly thinks he is the best rapper alive..cause this rapper is still alive and still outselling everybody even as 50 is fast approaching and every album number one never been done in rap history , 10 in a row. With no double album or albums full of features like somebody else to help. Easy to guess who this rapper is. Give a hint a white boy from 8 mile. All good lil Wayne is one of my favorites. Watch the snl performance when he was looking at this rapper like wtf how does he do it lol ",

            "answer_text": "Many factors are considered when looking at who might be the G.O.A.T., such as lyricism, influence, upbringing, production, cooperation with other artists and labels, etc. Lil' Wayne fulfilled many of these factors throughout his career. Lil' Wayne has had an enormous impact on rap, he's created incredible songs with powerful lyrics, and he's had his foot in several diverse areas of music. Looking at his career from 1998-2007, which consisted of pieces such as Carter I, II, III, Da Drought 2, 3, No Ceilings, I truly believe Lil' Wayne had the game in his hands for nearly a decade. Many modern rappers today wanted to be just like Lil' Wayne at some point of their lives. There is no surprise that you see elements of Lil' Wayne in the works of Chance the Rapper, Kendrick Lamar, Schoolboy Q, etc. He brought up Young Money and OVO, as well as today's most successful rappers like Drake. He shaped the game to what it is today, and there is no denying that he should be considered one of the best rappers of all time. ",
