            "answer_text": "Vibrato is the natural state of sustained sound from the vocal cords. If your throat is relaxed and in the proper position, and well-supported by your breath, the sound produced will not be straight and flat-sounding, but be alive with vibration. Maybe you\u2019re thinking of a wobble? Bigger voices are prone to that. It\u2019s just a matter of incorrect placement or inadequate breath support. Sometimes I feel like my vibrato is so wide you could drive a soprano through it. That\u2019s when I have to correct it. When I try to sing straight tone, like for early music, I can\u2019t really do it. Unless I squeeze and get an awful sound. No one wants that. But when I straighten it while staying relaxed, it feels straight to me, but the sound is properly vibrating. I do know one or two singers who can sing with actual straight time in a healthy way, but it\u2019s a mystery to me how they do it. ",

            "answer_text": "True vibrato is generated and controlled by the diaphragm and breath support. It is NOT produced by the vocal chords, jaw, lips, or any other areas of resonance. When you see a singer\u2019s jaw jabbing up and down, it\u2019s for show, a result of very poor training, or an after-effect used to manipulate resonance (which is founded in very GOOD training \u2014 but there is a distinction). That, however, is NOT the source of their vibrato. ",
