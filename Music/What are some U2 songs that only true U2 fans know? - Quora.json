            "answer_text": "Anything off Pop, Zooropa, and No Line. I would say a good portion of Joshua Tree seeing as really only the first four tracks are known incredibly well, as well as quite a few off Achtung, I would say that really the only one that has transcended time is One regardless of how much Mysterious Ways is played on the radio even today. 90% of War is widely unknown along with Unforgettable Fire (Pride being the only that is really famous), the list is actually quite largely because U2 is not a group that is known for only a handful of songs. They have a dedicated fanbase and have a lot of well-known songs but they don\u2019t have a Livin\u2019 on a Prayer, or a Don\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019, or a Sweet Child of Mine. Sure With or Without is easily their most famous song but they can get away with not playing it at concerts and still be able to please their fans. Whereas Bon Jovi per se, their name is synonymous with four songs; Prayer, Dead or Alive, Bad Name, and It\u2019s My Life. I feel even the most dedicated Bon Jovi fans would be disappointed if they didn\u2019t hear those songs at a concert. That doesn\u2019t happen with U2, I\u2019ve watched concerts where they don\u2019t play Streets, or Looking For, or any of their giant hits, they can do that and still put on a great show that pleases their fans, which shows their massive catalogue of music, I just listened to Boy a few days ago and that album is great . . . and it\u2019s their first one!
