            "answer_text": "Despite what other people may say, a lot of success comes from hidden opportunities a person/they get along the way. Some reasons as to why BTS has gotten farther internationally than other groups is because of 1. The right timing. If BTS had debuted back in the 2nd gen alongside Big Bang, SNSD, SUJU, etc. They would've been the ones who probably helped pave the way to international fame for younger groups, because social media was essentially just becoming as thing at this time and worldwide entertainment was practically unheard of at this time. They really would've had no way of getting the international fandom during this time, at least not one nearly as big as now. BTS debuted in the perfect time period, where social media is at the highest it's ever been, which clearly helped them A LOT for being able to crossover. Hence why all the awards they've won are social media based. 2. Their gender. This one may sound stupid, but if you really think about it, why hasn't Blackpink been able to get up to BTS' level despite essentially being the girl version of them? It\u2019s simple, because most group fans are girls, and girls generally want to see guys over girls for many reasons. This is why groups like TWICE and BP or Red Velvet haven't reached the same caliber of fame internationally as say, BTS or EXO, because despite having good music and talent, the fact of the matter is, girls want to see guys. 3. They chose the right concept. As compared to groups such as Astro, or even Got7, who both have more Korean public friendly concepts, BTS has always had a very Western approach to their music, from the sound of their music to the music videos. (Also the idea of rebranding their image to focus on hard/controversial topics was very smart because not only do Westerners love stuff like that, teenagers, especially girls, their main demographic, eat that stuff up) Also its very smart that they are rap-based, considering rap is one of the most listened to genres today, especially in the US. 4. Their company. I know people like to cite their company for being the main thing as to why they're underdogs, as it's obviously not a Big3, but in a way, Big Hit not being a major company gave them much more freedom to experiment with their concept and then being a fairly new company as well, gave them the ability to focus on BTS and only BTS. With Big Hit, there was no standards to live up to, no expectations, the only pressure for them was are they going to make it or not? In conclusion, in every success story, there are the hidden opportunities, that sometimes one can't control, for example their gender, their height, and sometimes it's just right time, right place, etc. It\u2019s never a bad thing, in fact more people should acknowledge and grab opportunities as much as possible, because they are the true reason behind success stories. BTS may be nice to one another, care for their fans, write their own music, etc. But the reality is, there are hundreds of groups all around the world who have been doing the same things they do, but haven't reached their level of success not because they're not good, but because they weren't awarded with the same opportunities BTS was. EDIT: Just so you guys know, an analysis is an analysis, I could do the same thing for Beyonce or IU. To say BTS is as successful as they are just because they write about real issues and are \u201cnot like other boy groups\u201d is not 100% true. BTS is great but there are a lot of factors that go into determining huge success like theirs. Also I'm not a Blink or anything, but it kind of irritates me that you guys find it so insulting that I compared BlackPink and BTS. They have very similar concepts and to non Kpop fans BP are seen as the girl version of BTS. Yeah BP isn't as deep as BTS is and they have their flaws, but at the end of the day they all work really hard for what they have and contribute to their respective groups as much as they can. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm an older BTS fan, so my answer is a bit more analytical and tending towards the \u201chow\u201d of things than just \u201cwhy\u201d. Disclaimer - it's going to be a long rant but read if you must. One thing sets BTS apart from other kpop acts in general - it's that they started out small and with a western approach to music. Unlike others, they were unshackled by preconceived notions or expectations that come with the \"idol\" tag because with BigHit they started out humble. From the very beginning they were fortunate enough to have carte blanche to exercise their creative abilities at their own pace and style - a privilege they'd never have had had they debuted under a bigger company like SM or YG. So, what they lacked in skill, they made up for in spades of creativity - and that's always a LOT more interesting. Speaking of skill, BTS aren't unskilled. Have you seen them dance? Have you heard them rap? They started out a hip hop outfit, which was clever because that was always their strongest suit. Vocally, they were a bit weak, but the amount of practice put in can clearly be seen in their vocal-driven comeback album, Love Yourself. This was really the era of the vocal line! Second, their looks! That is an undeniable factor. I think why they appeal so universally is because they somehow don't look like clones of each other. NONE of the members remotely resemble another member, even when they're styled similarly. Their visuals really stand out, and are very different from any of either the pretty boy or ripped dangerous guy look (though they've done those concepts ;p) we've been used to seeing in kpop, kdrama or Korea in general. I don't know about others, but I'm very glad that boring \"perfect\" clone look so preferred in kpop is going. Usually idol agencies just want to portray their graduates as lofty, ethereal beings who are SO perfect mere mortals like us should worship them, but not like, aspire to them or anything. But BTS just feel so normal, those boys could easily have been some guy you know in real life - a brother, a bf, bff, whatever, and you just feel like rooting for them. Hearing them talk about their tough walk to fame and the mental and social problems they've faced really made me want to work harder to pursue my own dreams. So that's a big point - they're relatable. Point four, is that, they're unbelievably funny. It's miraculous enough that 7 young, skilled, good looking men came together in one place deciding to awe the world with music and art, but for them to be equally funny? How is that even possible? We love people who don't take themselves too seriously, and I bet BTS makes a good fraction of their money just from making memes of themselves. I'm into fashion, so that's one more point in their favor. Innately, while their style is still Korean street-chic, but it has tinges of 80s BritRock or 90s shonen manga flavor. That said, each of them have a signature style of their own - Rap Monster's airport fashion and MV styling remind me of manga characters who came over from the dark side.    But let's not forget this - the picture of a man who is trying his very best to turn good.  V's style is classic. It's no secret he likes Gucci and has never been spotted in jeans. How does he resist the temptation to just put on a comfortable pair of jeans one day? It's superhuman. He's the poster boy for grandpa-chic clothing.     Jungkook is the opposite of that. His fashion is all-American skater - shirts tucked into really tight pants, or tees (not to forget his Timberlands) and it really complements his toned godlike bod like no Korean baggy clothing could have done.   All quite basic, really. Suga's style screams delinquent and hellraiser chic. His carelessly thrown-together outfits are simple but flashy in a great way. I've loved every jacket-over-jeans combination he's ever worn.   Hoseok's style is more experimental and colorful which suits his personality to a T. It's my favorite out of all of Bangtan. Whether it's casual at the airport or formals, Hoseok just awes you with how his awesome fashion sense complements his beautiful body.     Jimin often wears clothes that cocoon him from head to toe, but it's their stage outfits that bring out the best of his stunning visuals.     Well, if you must,then.. Jin's off-duty style is quite boy-next-doorish, like JK's, and it compliments him very well, but he looks coolest in leather, but he rarely wears that (so thank God for mic drop).    Because fashion is on everyone's radar today, I think what a celebrity decides to wear determines their status a lot. Another factor I thought was pivotal in ensuring BTS's success is that the eldest members are very level headed, intelligent and quite well sorted out. Since seniority counts for a lot in Korean society, often decision-making rests with the eldest, who may not necessarily be the wisest. But in BTS's case they were spared that awkwardness because the BTS hyung line are the perfect mentors for the younger ones. Also, their diction. I don't speak Korean, but I really like the Bangtan boys' pronunciations, especially that of Jimin, Hoseok and Jungkook. Also, during all my years listening to kpop, barring non-idol rap songs, I used to hear the same clich\u00e9d words and phrases in 95% songs, especially love and party ones. When I started listening to BTS, I truly realized how beautiful and interesting the Korean vocabulary is because BTS often use words I never heard before. listen to Sea, Mic drop, Tomorrow, and the Cypher series. They write their own music, mostly. I mean, not many kpop idols are allowed to compose, even if they may have the talent to do so. Not so with BTS. And when you're invested in your music down to the composing, it makes you a lot more passionate about your work. And it shows. BTS clearly loves what they're doing. They're not conflicted because it's all their own work and their creative abilities are not being suppressed in any way. In fact so many kpop artists in the past have all admitted to hating the music they create. Lastly, their high-concept MVs. Crazy production values. Watch \u201cNot Today\u201d, \u201cBlood Sweat Tears\u201d or even their older \u201cRun\u201d. Everything, down to the smallest twitch in choreography and the tiniest fashion accessory is eye catching. Not to mention enough mind-bending material for us to wrack brains over for years after. Who would complain? ",
