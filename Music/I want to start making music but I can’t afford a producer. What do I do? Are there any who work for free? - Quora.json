            "answer_text": "I want to start making music but I can\u2019t afford a producer. What do I do? Are there any who work for free? \u201cProducer\u201d as in someone who will bring you into a studio, mic up your instruments, and record your songs? Or \u201cProducer\u201d as in someone who will build backing tracks for your songs and make them available to you? The title is a bit adrift in the new world of DAWs and basement beat builders.  One in every eight Americans are making music in some way. I produce, but it's rare that I ever touch a microphone or an instrument. I would suggest you determine what you need, then start looking on Craigslist, Facebook, etc for people to work with. There are people who will \u201ccollaborate\u201d with you, but they will likely not be any more experienced than you are. But if you can't pay, beggars can't be choosers. I did a lot of \u201cfree work\" when I was getting started. Either because I liked the project and got involved, or I had time and needed the experience and body of work. The drawback seems to be that the less money is involved, the more flakey the participants are. If I want vocals on a track I've built, I might be able to find someone who will do it for free - eventually. I can probably find someone on Fiverr who will do the minimum. Or I can bite the bullet and pay someone a fair amount if I want it good, right, and now. Just like the vocalists I work with, I rarely work for free anymore. There's no percieved value in something that's free. So people will make me jump through hoops, complain a lot, and possibly not even use the track I built for them. At least if I get paid, it's somewhat worth my trouble. I do a lot of spec work on contract, but it's always paid off for me. Good luck, and have fun with it! PS, there are sites like sinimabeats, and a few others, where you can license complete backing tracks pretty cheap. ",
