            "answer_text": "It's mostly a lot of random nonsense that is strung together to create a certain atmosphere and mood that is both compelling and mysterious. John Lennon was an expert at creating songs that combined a sort of anarchist ethos with a disdain for the very popular culture that he had helped create. Often thought of as Lennon's anti-hippie anthem, it could also be interpreted as a stirring call for sexual and/or political liberation. But the truth is, it was mostly random nonsense.  There are a few references that are worth exploring although any ascribed meaning is basically my own subjective speculations and musing. \"Juju eyeballs\" may be a reference to the cover of Dr John's 1968 voodoo rock album Gris-Gris, an album that was much praised by the British underground at the time and one that Lennon probably heard several times. It's quite awful but there you are. I agree that Old Flat-Top is Lennon himself and the Ono sideboard is Yoko. Spinal cracker may refer to an old Japanese custom of having women walk on their husband's backs to loosen their spine and remove tension. I never heard of to-jam football referring to George Harrison's love of that sport but it is entirely plausible.   There are of course numerous drug references as well. Sadly at this point in his life, Lennon, along with his wife, were heavily addicted to painkillers and heroin.   To be honest, this may be the most overrated song in the Beatles' cannon. Paul McCartney's playing however is flat out brilliant however and elevates the song from a mess into something approaching high art. ",

            "answer_text": " \u201cGet together\u2026right now\u201d (\u201cGet Together\u201d, 1967 hit song for the Youngbloods\u201d) Following the very helpful quotes below from Beatles Bible and also (via Beatles Bible) some quotes from John Lennon and Timothy Leary themselves, I\u2019ll provide my own B.S. lyrical interpretations of the song \u201cCome Together\u201d: Beatles Bible: \u201cThe song was composed for Timothy Leary's campaign to stand against Ronald Reagan as governor of California\u2026\u201d Leary and his wife met with John and Yoko on 1 June 1969. \u201cThe Learys participated in the recording of Lennon's Give Peace A Chance, and were both namechecked in the lyrics:\u201cEverybody's talking about:\u2026Timmy Leary, Rosemary\u2026\u201d \u201cThe following day Lennon offered to help Leary's campaign. His slogan was 'Come together, join the party'.\u201d Leary was subsequently imprisoned for cannabis possession and the campaign ended, \u201cenabling Lennon to record the song with the Beatles.\u201d John Lennon: \u2018The thing was created in the studio. It's gobbledygook; Come Together was an expression that Leary had come up with for his attempt at being president or whatever he wanted to be, and he asked me to write a campaign song. I tried and tried, but I couldn't come up with one. But I came up with this, Come Together, which would've been no good to him - you couldn't have a campaign song like that, right?\u2019 (John Lennon, \u2018All we are Saying\u2019) Timothy Leary: \u201cAlthough the new version was certainly a musical and lyrical improvement on my campaign song, I was a bit miffed that Lennon had passed me over this way... When I sent a mild protest to John, he replied with typical Lennon charm and wit that he was a tailor and I was a customer who had ordered a suit and never returned. So he sold it to someone else.\u201d Steve Turner in \u2018A Hard Day\u2019s Write\u2019 (via Beatles Bible): \u201cCome Together was Lennon's last politicised stance in The Beatles, although much of it was shrouded in imagery: the song lampooned the hippy figureheads who would seek followers among the dropouts of society.\u201d (A Hard Day\u2019s Write, Steve Turner) Beatles Bible: \u201cMusically, Come Together took its cue from Chuck Berry's 1956 song You Can't Catch Me; both songs contain the lines \"Here come old flat-top\". John Lennon: \u201cCome Together is me - writing obscurely around an old Chuck Berry thing. I left the line in 'Here comes old flat-top.' It is nothing like the Chuck Berry song, but they took me to court because I admitted the influence once years ago. I could have changed it to 'Here comes old iron face,' but the song remains independent of Chuck Berry or anybody else on earth.\u201d \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. And now my B.S. interpretation, which is irrefutably faithful to John\u2019s (undisclosed) intended meanings and therefore is beyond reproach: Here come old flat top (John is directly quoting from Chuck Berry\u2019s 1956 song \u2018You Can\u2019t Catch Me\u2019, and Chuck was referring to a souped-up car) He come groovin' up slowly (John changes Chuck\u2019s original \u2018He was moving up wih me\u2019 to alternative lyrics suggesting a dude who is ambling up casually. John\u2019s flat top reference is no longer about a car, but about the guy\u2019s top hat, such as those worn at the Ascot horse races held every June in Britain. This song was germinating in John\u2019s mind about this time. It brings to mind a snobbish well-off idle-rich kind of guy. But in this case, it is a symbol of someone who dwells in a loftier and somewhat self-superior head-in-the-clouds plane. John is quickly morphing to the true subject of his song. It is a very specific person who John was still very disillusioned with - and consequently had a very big chip on his shoulder with - at the time of writing the song):  (No, not Prince Charles - seen here with his Ascot top hat - it is someone else. It is another person of privilege; a person who holds themselves up as someone special.) He got joo joo eyeballs (\u2018joo-joo\u2019 relates to \u201cevil eye\u201d and \u201cjuju\u201d beliefs. But John loved wordplay, and \u2018joo-joo\u2019 sounds a lot like \u2018jujubes\u2019. While there is a Chinese fruit that is sometimes called a jujube eyeball because of its size, shape and colour when peeled, it\u2019s unlikely John would have been familiar with this relatively unfamiliar fruit. John is referring here to the well-know liquorice candies called Jujubes. Just as \u2018kaleidoscope eyes\u2019 in John\u2019s song \u2018Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\u2019 evoked images of eyes that shift colours, \u2018jujube eyeballs\u2019 evokes images of multi-coloured eyes. Eyes that are superficially appealing like candies - which can also soothe, entice and break your resistance. )  He one holy roller (By the time this song was released, George Harrison had become a devout follower of Krishna consciousness. But it\u2019s not about George. The most likely candidate would be the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The Maharishi was a holy man\u2026a \u2018holy roller\u2019. There\u2019s also a possible additional play on words, because the Maharishi was also a \u2018high roller\u2019 because of his affiliation with stars like the Beatles.)  He got hair down to his knee (The Maharishi had very long hair) Got to be a joker (The Maharishi giggled all the time. He always wanted his followers to be happy, and he would entertain them with laughing remarks) He just do what he please (John is perhaps somewhat angrily saying that the Maharishi gets away with whatever he wants, with relative impunity because of his exalted stature. John had been persuaded that the Maharishi had put the moves on some of his female followers, and so is saying that he just does whatever he likes) He wear no shoeshine (The Maharishi was always barefoot or in sandals) He got toe jam football (Presumably John is disparaging the Maharishi by claiming that he had a foot hygiene issue, probably from walking around barefoot. But this is perhaps just more Maharishi putdowns, similar to those in John\u2019s song \u201cSexy Sady\u201d) He got monkey finger (This is usually heard as \u201cmonkey finger\u201d. There were many monkeys living near the Ashram in India where the Beatles attended a meditation retreat the previous year. John is possibly comparing the Maharishi with those monkeys that would try to grab food from the students while they meditated, perhaps likening this to the Maharishi trying to grasp donations from wealthy devotees such as the Beatles. However, I hear \u201cmocking finger\u201d. If so, then an alternate interpretation might fit better (funny how that works, isn\u2019t it?): John could be feeling like the Maharishi was having a joke at the Beatles\u2019 expense - slightly mocking them because they were taken in\u2026 Almost like they were metaphorically being given the finger.) He shoot Coca-Cola (This is an ironic comment. The last thing that the Maharishi would do would be to shoot cocaine. But it is likely a reference to the Maharishi dispensing sacharine bubbly sugar-water platitudes as a way to cure the sorrows of life - as the Maharishi had glossed over Brian Epstein\u2019s untimely death with what John perceived as namby-pamby trite but soothing words. It is implying that the platitudes dispensed by the yogi weren\u2019t much different than escaping life by shooting up with sugar-water)  He say I know you, you know me (This would be a typical Maharishi pearl of wisdom. How we all know each other and are known in turn) One thing I can tell you is (John is rererring to himself now, He is about to declare something very important) You got to be free (John is saying you have to be free. Free even of the Maharishi, who had been briefly a father figure to John, but whom John had now rejected because of his disillusionment with the Maharishi) Come together, right now Over me (John is making a token reference to the Timothy Leary campaign slogan, but actually he is referring not Leary but to himself. He\u2019s suggesting that people come together to hear his message of freedom, even at that very moment as they listen. It is possibly a reference to the theme conveyed in the 1967 hit song \u201cGet Together\u201d: \u201cEverybody get together try and love one another right now.\u201d \u201cGet together\u2026right now\u201d becomes \u201cCome together, right now\u201d. How does everyone come together at one time? By coming together over John\u2019s song with this simple but powerful message of the need to be free.) He bad production (This is DEFINITELY a mis-heard lyric. The word is not \u201cbad\u201d. This is \u201cBag Production\u201d. Bag Productions Ltd. was a public relations company that had recently been formed by John and Yoko. It used the philosophy of \u201cbagism\u201d to promote world peace. Here\u2019s an explanation from Wikipedia: \u201cBagism is a term which was created by John Lennon and Yoko Ono as part of their extensive peace campaign in the late 1960s. The intent of bagism was to satirize prejudice and stereotyping. Bagism involved literally wearing a bag over one's entire body. According to John and Yoko, by living in a bag, a person could not be judged by others on the basis of skin colour, gender, hair length, attire, age, or any other such attributes. It was presented as a form of total communication: instead of focusing on outward appearance, the listener would hear only the bagist's message.\u201d) He got walrus gumboot (Another reference by John to the Walrus in \u201cThe Walrus and the Carpenter\u201d. The Walrus is also a symbol of someone in two of his other songs: \u201cI am the Walrus\u201d and \u201cGlass Onion\u201d, with the former indicating that the Walrus was John and the latter saying that the Walrus was actually Paul. This time he is referencing himself as the walrus, rather than Paul. This was a bit of a running joke, because John was always confused about the identity of the walrus character in the Lewis Carroll poem. The gumboot may refer to boots worn by John to weather the English rain, as that spring of 1969 had brought a fair amount of rain. This expression is likely just a verbal mashup describing John\u2019s artefacts) He got Ono sideboard (\u201csideboards\u201d is a British word meaning \u201csideburns\u201d. John had large sideburns at this time. He\u2019s either referencing his new legal middle name \u201cOno\u201d, or he is comparing his flowing sideburns with Yoko\u2019s flowing hair. At any rate, he is still describing himself. Although it\u2019s probably unintentional, this term could also be a riff on \u201cflat top\u201d since a sideboard can also refer to a \u201cflat-topped piece of furniture\u201d.) He one spinal cracker (Yoko had recently been pregnant, but had lost her\u2019s and John\u2019s baby in November 1968, only three months before her due date. During pregnancy the woman\u2019s body produces a hormone called relaxin that allows joints and ligaments to loosen in preparation for the birth process. The ligaments that support the spine also loosen, causing instability and back pain. John may be referring to those times during Yoko\u2019s pregnancy when he could have helped pop her back to relieve her discomfort.) He got feet down below his knee (Doesn\u2019t everyone? This is a joking comment, as if John is trying to describe something significant, when in fact it is just a \u201cCaptain Obvious\u201d kind of remark.) Hold you in his armchair (This visual allusion is to John holding Yoko in his arms\u2026reportedly John\u2019s actual words were intended to be - or actually are - \u201cHold you in his arms, yeah\u201d. I hear the words as \u201carmchair\u201d, but the meaning is the same: Yoko is being held in John\u2019s arms, perhaps while she is sitting on his lap while he (depending on the lyrics) sits in his armchair.) You can feel his disease (Yoko feels - or comprehends and is empathetic about - John\u2019s \u201cdisease\u201d. The disease is all of John\u2019s issues, which she perceives intimately and causes her to \u201cfeel for him\u201d - and which he hopes she can help set him free from. The crux again is that John wants to be free.) Come together, right now Over me (Yoko is now invited to come together with John in unity, to share her life with him and to help them be free to live their lives as an independent couple) He roller coaster (Now the subject changes abruptly to the final character in this song. The first verse was about the Maharishi. The second verse was about John. This final verse is about another important person in John\u2019s life: Paul McCartney. The roller coaster is a reference to the \u201chelter skelter\u201d amusement park ride in Paul\u2019s recent song \u201cHelter Skelter\u201d. Paul had compared his own relationships with a helter skelter ride, and John is making a masked reference to this song) He got early warning (Paul had been given early warnings about John\u2019s intention to leave the group) He got muddy water (Paul \u201cgets\u201d (i.e. \u201clikes\u201d) Muddy Waters, the blues musician, as did many other British musicians at this time. Muddy Waters also had a hit song called \u201cI got my Mojo Workin\u2019\u201d, which is a lead-in to the next phrase:) He one Mojo filter (You have good mojo if you're popular and successful - although you can lose your mojo. It's literally a magic charm bag. John is saying that Paul may be filtering out the mojo that the Beatles had. Paul might cause the Beatles to lose their mojo. It was around this time that Paul was considered by the other Beatles to being an obstacle to allowing Allen Klein to manage them. John, George and Ringo thought that Klein could help the Beatles with their business and money problems.) He say one and one and one is three (Paul was always so particular, logical, and ready to give prescriptive advice in the group. It is as if John is saying: \u201cYes, we know that 1+1+1=3. Thank you for your always helpful instruction, Paul!\u201d But it also refers to the 3 Beatles who sided with Allen Klein, with Paul being the 4th and odd man out.) Got to be good looking (Paul was the cute one) 'Cause he's so hard to see (which made up for his being so hard to get through to, especially when it came to coming together with the other Beatles to see their side about Beatles issues, which were so pressing at this time) Come together right now Over me Come together, yeah (and this once again is returning to the theme of coming together to be free. John wants Paul to align with the rest of the group so they all can be free, John wanted to be free of the Beatles and their obligations and the contracts that bound them together, He needed Paul to come together over John\u2019s appeals for a unified approach to resolving their troubles, and through this they could all be set free) \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Well, I gave an \u201cearly warning\u201d that this might be a BS interpretation. However, perhaps it is as legit as any other interpretation. Like all interpretations of impenetrable song lyrics (that even the writer doesn\u2019t necessarily understand), we are well-advised to take them with a large grain of salt. ",
