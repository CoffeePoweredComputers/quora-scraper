            "answer_text": "Maths is an abbreviation of mathematics Math is 1. an old English word meaning to cut or scythe crops, grass etc, a-mowing 2. The name of an order of Hindu monks from the word matha - meaning hut. Mathematics is the discipline term used for the abstract \u201cscience of number, quantity, and space, either as abstract concepts (pure mathematics), or as applied to other disciplines such as physics and engineering (applied mathematics)\u201d OED. Having said that mathematics has a tendency to mean different things at different times as well as different things for different people at the same time. Asking people to say what they think mathematics is or what it\u2019s about often generates an emotional, pejorative, or even reverence towards the subject in a way that is not often replicated in other subjects. Its not like Marmite - you don\u2019t either love it or hate. There are a whole range of definitions descriptions and meanings that are dependent entirely on who you ask. Here are some thoughts of individuals talking about the nature, purpose, learning and/or teaching of mathematics across a wide spectrum of time. They include folk who we would call \u201cmathematicians\u201d, those that profess to be mathematicians, educators of mathematics, policy makers, and writers. See if you can put a name to any of them or perhaps a rough date for the time when they were spoken/written The essence of mathematics is not to make simple things complicated, but to make complicated things simple.2. The danger already exists that mathematicians have a covenant with the devil to darken the spirit and to confine man in the bonds of Hell 3. The great misconception about mathematics -- and it stifles and thwarts more students than any other single thing -- is the notion that mathematics is about formulas and cranking out computations. It is the unconsciously held delusion that mathematics is a set of rules and formulas that have been worked out by God knows who for God knows why, and the student's duty is to memorise all this stuff. Such students seem to feel that sometime in the future their boss will walk into the office and demand \"Quick, what's the quadratic formula?\" Or, \"Hurry, I need to know the derivative of 3x^2 - 6x + 7.\" There are no such employers. 4. It is not sufficient to say that children must have a grasp of decimals. You must say that at age seven a pupils should be able to divide by a single digit number, at age nine by two digits and at 10 by a figure which contains a decimal. 5. Angling may be said to be so like the mathematics, that it can never be fully learnt. 6. Mathematics seems to be understood by most people to be a body of established knowledge and procedures - facts and rules. . . . [This view] denies the value of mathematics as an activity in which to engage. Decision making, experimenting, hypothesising, generalising, modelling, communicating, interpreting, proving, symbolising and pattern finding . . . .Without engaging in processes such as these no mathematician would have been able to create the procedures and systems mentioned above in the first place. 7.. . . . teachers who, at the present day persist in thinking about algebra and arithmetic as dealing with laws of number, and about geometry as dealing with laws of surface and solid content, are doing the best that lies in them to put their children on the wrong track. 8. Mathematics is the gate and key of the sciences . . . . Neglect of mathematics works injury to all knowledge, since he who is ignorant of it cannot know the other sciences or the things of the world. 9. Mathematics initially arose from a need to count and record numbers . . . . If we define mathematics as any activity that arises out of, or directly generates, concepts relating to numbers or spatial configurations together with some form of logic, we can then legitimately include in our study proto-mathematics, which existed when no written records were available. 10. Mathematics is not only taught because it is useful. It should be a source of delight and wonder, offering pupils intellectual excitement and an appreciation of its essential creativity. Some of the questions for me are: who is closest to the \u201cright\u201d definition, what might learners of the subject have to say about the \u201cnature of mathematics\u201d, how do the comments reflect school mathematics curricula, what does the comment say about the person who made it, which comments reflect a \u201cteachers\u2019s\u201d view, do students know what they are being taught in a general sense and finally what view of mathematics is the most useful for students who are just entering the education system? In the UK, five is the school start age. In 10 years time some of these children will be going to work, some will be studying, some will be homeless, some ill, some caring for a parent, some will be involved in a major calamity, some will have a child of their own, some will be preparing for university in a whole range of subjects. Many will be doing things that haven\u2019t been invented yet. Which comment about mathematics would best serve them in their current and future lives? If your answer is \u201cNone of the above\u201d construct your own view of what mathematics is and how it should be taught. Finally, if there is anyone reading this who fancies taking it a bit further please let me know - and we will rewrite the maths curriculum across the world, or maybe just stir up up a few policy makers or at the very least give some learners and educators something to think about. Thank you for reading this far. I am happy to reveal authors and dates for the comments above - just ask. R. ",

In Greece, the word \"mathematics\" came to have a narrower and more technical meaning, meaning \"the study of mathematics\" (in the modern sense of the word), even from the Classical Age. It meant learning the art of mathematics. In Latin and English around 1700, the term \"mathematics\" more often meant astrology or sometimes astronomy, rather than mathematics in the modern sense of the word. This has led to many misinterpretations and misunderstandings, most notably St. Augustine's infamous warning that Christians should \"pay attention to the mathematical concept\", and while he mentions mathematics in the astrological sense of the time and in essence condemns it. astrology, the phrase can sometimes be misinterpreted and one considers the saint to condemn mathematics, in the modern sense of the word. The plural appearing in English, as in French \"les math\u00e9matiques\" and the least used derivative in the singular \"la math\u00e9matique\", goes back to the neuter plural in Latin \"mathematica\" (Cicero), based on the Greek plural \"\u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac-mathematica\". used by Aristotle and means \"almost all things mathematical\", although it is possible that English was originally borrowed only from the adjective \"mathematical\" and re-formed the noun \"mathematics\", according to the physics of physics. ) and metaphysics, which he inherited directly from the Greek language. In English, mathematical nouns take verb forms in the singular. It is often abbreviated to \"maths\", or even, mainly in English-speaking North America, to \"math\". From Wikipedia ",
