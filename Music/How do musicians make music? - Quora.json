            "answer_text": "I believe each musician\u2019s particular process is unique to them, though I'm sure there are similarities. Emotion, for example, is always essential when making music. Personally, I just have fun on whatever instrument I'm using until something jumps out at me. I'll be screwing around and suddenly think \u201cwow that really resonates deeply\u201d, that is, it creates a powerful feeling (could be uplifting, sombre etc). Then I'll hang on to that particular feeling and develop the section further until I'm satisfied. Sometimes it ends up being a little loop, other times a whole piece. Often other sections I\u2019ve composed in the past are incorporated (though I\u2019ve come to think of this as lazy). Basically you explore yourself through the composition. ",
