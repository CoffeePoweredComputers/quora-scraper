            "answer_text": "They have to make money either from ads or subscriptions in order to pay the artists, their bandwidth and the employees. If they don\u2019t make money via ads or their paid service, they can\u2019t afford to pay for the rights to the music. Pandora, etc. are all the same. There was a service, Grooveshark, that tried to work around royalty payments, and it collapsed. Spotify has a free service with ads every 10 minutes or so, and a premium service that costs about $10 a month with no ads. That has been their model since the beginning. I think they may be adding more ads now, but they were never 100% ad free unless you paid for the premium subscriptions. ",
