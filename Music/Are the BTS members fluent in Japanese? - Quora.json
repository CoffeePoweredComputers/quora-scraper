            "answer_text": "As in May 2019, yes they are. In order of fluency : RM > Jhope > Jimin > Suga & Jin & Jungkook & Taehyung Why? RMRM has always been the spokeperson. Ever since their debut, he already lead the group in every interview. SO, he naturally feel like he need to learn more in Japanese. And in most of their Japanese interview, they are usually allowed to speak in Korean (as the Japanese show\u2019s editor will put on subtitle), but RM will always try to speak in Japanese on the Japanese show, and he never stutter in Japanese ever since 2017. 2. Jhope On 2017\u20132018, Jhope attend a lot of Japanese shows/interview as a representative of BTS (they didn;t attend as a whole for certain shows), and some of it, he attended with Jimin or Taehyung, and Jhope did the most talking and he is very natural. He also constantly showed that he had this paper where he brought the paper everywhere with him, which the paper had some Japanese \u2018homework\u2019 for him. And, I would say he is the closest to RM\u2019s fluency in Japanese, tho he still stutter a bit sometimes. 3. Jimin. By the end of 2017, Jimin is still lacking of confidence in his Japanese. When he attended a Japanese show with Jhope, he stuttered a lot and barely speak. But, by the middle to the end of 2018, he gained more confidence. japanese Fans from their japanese concert and their Japan muster said that these days, Jimin tried to give the ending ment by not looking at the prompter. And he is also more confident in Japanese events/shows that they have. 4. Suga, Jin, Jungkook, Taehyung Actually they are all fluent. But, I just think they are not as loud or as talkative as the other three. Personally, I think its because just like me, if I have a groupmate that is more fluent than me in my 2nd languange, then I would let em speak the most and I\u2019ll only talk in certain part where it\u2019s necessary only. But, I do believe all of them is fluent. They conducted their fanmeeting in Japanese for four days with a Japanese MC, and they barely speak in Korean, and they talked fully in Japanese. They had concerts in Japan, and they do have translators (in the background), but they rarely used it and they talked Japanese the entire time, without help from anyone. So yeah, as in May 2019, I concluded they are fluent, tho they are always learning, as they said. ",

But i don\u2019t know about JK and Jimin whether they are fluent are not but they speak japanese in concerts. But i know one thing for sure. BTS oppas are trying to communicate with all the ARMY and they are learning languages for ARMY sake. ",
