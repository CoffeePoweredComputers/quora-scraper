            "answer_text": "MIXED RESPONSE:No doubt some of Dylan\u2019s verse reflects badly on his relationships with women, but if one regards the entire progress of his relationship to women, one cannot help but see the emergence of maturity.Regard the lyrics of Shelter From The Storm, a song, I believe that reflects a central experience in Dylan\u2019s self-realization. Clearly he credits the voice of \u201cher\u201d with his ability to devote himself to his calling. If one considers \u201cthe storm\u201d to be the chaos of this world that he experienced \u201cin another lifetime\u201d, then he was able to achieve a second world, second lifetime, thanks to a time of peace, what the old-timers called \u201cthe Halcyon Days\u201d, in a place of \u201cshelter from the storm\u201d. In that mystic moment \u201cShe was standing there\u201d in Glory. The fact that he could not remain in that state, in the presence of that human/divine being attests to the transient but unforgettable, once in a lifetime meeting with the Vessel. There is no doubt of the religious/spiritual condition of that experience. BUT \u201cNow there's a wall between us something there's been lost/I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed\u201d... rare indeed are those who can REMAIN in that state. But his memory and longing will serve him a lifetime: \u201cWell I'm living in a foreign country [back to earth, thanks a lot]but I'm bound to cross the line [we all die]Beauty walks a razor's edge someday I'll make it mine [a deeper view of beauty]If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her [God as source, \u201cher\u201d as the Vessel] were born\"Come in,\" she said, \"I'll give you shelter from the storm.\" Considering the holy praise he offers, with typical bitter-sweet Dylanesque acid, I do not see how he could possibly be sexist at this point.

            "answer_text": "That is a very personal question that would require knowing the man well. Artists sometimes write songs from the perspective of others, or from the perspective of Bob in the 60s, so you can\u2019t cherry pick lyrics to determine how he feels about women in general, now. You also cannot judge him from media interviews, as he was notorious for messing with the media and journos. And you most certainly cannot answer this question by quoting personal relationships he had with particular partners such as Joan Baez, that\u2019s like saying anyone who has a bad, bitter breakup is sexist, which isn\u2019t really cool. In the answers below I can see a lot cherry picking of potentially sexist sounding lyrics. So just to even the score a little bit, what about: \u201cThe man in me will hide sometimes to keep from bein\u2019 seen But that\u2019s just because he doesn\u2019t want to turn into some machine Took a woman like you To get through to the man in me\u201d \u201cSara, Sara,Wherever we travel we're never apart.Sara, oh Sara,Beautiful lady, so dear to my heart\u201d Also, look at all the feminists/female recording artists that have covered his songs: Adele - \u2018Make you feel my love\u2019Chrissie Hynde - \u2018I shall be released\u2019Norah Jones - \u2018I\u2019ll be your baby tonight\u2019Cat Power - \u2018Stuck Inside Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again\u2019Nina Simone - \u2018the Ballad of Hollis Brown\u2019Nico - \u2018I\u2019ll keep it with mine\u2019Tracy Chapman - \u2018The times they are a changin\u2019PJ Harvey - \u2018Highway 61 revisited\u2019Emmylou Harris - \u2018Every Grain of sand\u2019Just to name a few. Not the lineup you\u2019d expect to cover a sexist artist\u2019s songs. When you label someone a sexist, you\u2019d want to have pretty conclusive evidence. After all he\u2019s written a lot of beautiful songs that have inspired countless female artists. Since I don\u2019t know him personally or haven\u2019t seen any evidence that he is sexist, I\u2019ll give him the benefit of the doubt and say NO. ",
