            "answer_text": "It is generally believed that Mozart's last composition was his Requiem (K626), which was unfinished when he died on the fifth of December, 1791.  Accordingly to the K\u00f6chel catalogue, there are several other works he was composing in 1791. Some of the more famous include:  K595: Piano Concerto No. 27 (Mozart)K614: String Quintet No. 6 (Mozart)K618: The Motet in D which includes the famous Ave verum corpus (Mozart)K620: The Magic Flute (The Magic Flute), that premiered in Vienna in on the 30th of September, 1791.

            "answer_text": "The last piece he worked on was the Requiem in d minor, K. 626. It is probably not possible to say with certainty which part of it he was touching up before he laid down his pen for the last time. The last piece that Mozart entered in his catalogue of compositions was the \u201clittle Masonic cantata\u201d, K. 623. This, therefore, may have been the final composition he had the time to complete.  It was finished on November 15, 1791. Only five days later he would be confined to his bed for what proved to be his final illness. He died on December 5, aged only 35. His early death is certainly one of the most tragic events in the history of music. One wishes he had lived as long as Haydn or even Bach. He didn\u2019t, and we are infinitely the poorer for that.
