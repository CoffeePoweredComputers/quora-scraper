            "answer_text": "This is tricky, because of the acoustics of most rehearsal spaces. Often what sounds fine to your ears when playing, will sound harsh or muddy even when recorded by the best microphones. For a while back in the early 2000\u2019s I did a lot of demos for bands recording with just a stereo pair and one or two supplemental mics. The goal being to arrive at a finished demo much faster than the traditional method of recording a dozen or more tracks and mixing them down. The other goal was to portray the bands much closer to how they actually sounded. In the punk rock/alternative heavy music scene there is often a lot of animosity towards \u2018produced\u2019 sounding records. They are thought of as being \u2018sold out\u2019. So I was emulating the jazz recording methods of the 50s- and 60s. What I did was to use a pair of multi pattern Large Diaphragm Condenser mics. I experimented with cardiod, omni, figure eight and hypercardiod patterns. The hypercardiod seemed to have the best sound at first, but I quickly found that it was the least usable in terms of EQ and compression. The next best was the figure 8. Set up in what is known as the Blumlein array. This creates a mono compatible stereo signal, with a good stereo representation. It also avoids the odd tonality of stereo coincident array using cardiod(heart shaped) mics. This also addressed one of the problems of recording bands in their rehearsal spaces. Often they are set up in a small room with all the amps, PA and drums arranged around the room. There is no left-right perspective, only 360 degrees perspective. So I set up the mics basically in front of the drums, getting a good amount of toms and cymbals as a result. Then I count on the guitar and vocals to just cut through on their own. I often took a bass DI signal if the amp had one available. This worked 75% of time very well. I only had to notch out a bit of cymbal stridence, and maybe add a bit of eq to help distinguish the vocals and guitars. The other method I like a lot is to use a mid-side technique. This involves a figure 8 mic and a cardiod mic. set up right on top of each other. You also have to use a \u2018mid side matrix\u2019 to properly mix the signals on play back to achieve the desired effect. This is not hard. There are a few tutorials on Youtube that show how to do this in Logic, Pro-Tools or Audacity with some simple track routing set up. This works really well if the band is set up in a left to right arrangement, and you can find a place in the room that sounds really good. One band I recorded in Santa Rosa California like this loved the result so much the drummer (a very pretty young woman) would always come up to me and give me a big hug and peck on the cheek every time I saw her. She loved her drum sound so much!The great thing about this is that like Blumlein it is very stereo, with mono compatibility. But you can also vary the stereo effect when mixing by changing the amount of \u2018mid\u2019 and \u2018side\u2019 output. It\u2019s really cool, and in fact a lot of mastering of major label releases is done using mid-side technique to process the final mix (This is not through microphones, just changing a stereo mix to mid-side and back again). As far as microphones, the best value right now would be Audio Technica 2000 series mics. They nearly as good as 4000 series with a few less features and slightly less impressive specs, but same general design. I\u2019d either pick up a pair of 2050 or a 2020 and a 2050. The AT 2022 is also an affordable purpose built stereo mic. Keep in mind you will need mic stands, or a mic stand with an adapter to hold two mics. If all this is too much, and you don\u2019t already have a mixer or interface with phantom power, just get a the old standby Zoom H4, H5 or H6. ",
