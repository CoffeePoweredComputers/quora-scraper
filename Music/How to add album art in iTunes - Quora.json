            "answer_text": "To add custom album art, you can right click on the song and select \u201cget info\u201d. You can rename the artist, composer, add lyrics, etc. To add album artwork simply select the \u201cartwork\u201d tab and add artwork. This doesn\u2019t just work on music imports from GarageBand or a music software; this can work for any music file in iTunes. Not 100% sure if this works on Windows however, I use a Mac running OS Catalina wit the new Apple Music app. ",

Select whichever songs for which you would like to download, then select \u201cGet Album Artwork.\u201d I believe you can access this option under either the File menu or the right-hand click menu. I\u2019m also not sure if this option is only available for iTunes Match subscribers or all iTunes users. If not, use the \u2018\u2018Artwork\u201d tab under \u201cGet Info.\u201d ",
