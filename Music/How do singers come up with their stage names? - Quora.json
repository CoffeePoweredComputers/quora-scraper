            "answer_text": "I have one, which I barely use, but I love it and I\u2019d love to use it more often: Pedro Cucaracha I love the name, hahaha! Nothing can be more latino than \u201cPedro\u201d, and \u201cCucaracha\u201d is because I tell people my power animal is not the wolf, or the dolphin or the eagle, but the cockroach: The mighty survivior of the urban jungle. So, combine both and you have a name that doesn\u2019t match at all with my stile of music (hard rock/heavy metal). But it sounds funny as hell, and I love funny! By the way, I\u2019m not a singer, just a humble bassist. But here are some stories I\u2019ve heard (to be confirmed):  \u201cSting\u201d got his nickname from a shirt he used to wear which was of clack and yellow striped, and people told him he looked like a wasp.  \u201cBono\u201d adopted his nickname from a microphone brand, \u201cBono Vox\u201d. He loved it and adopted it as his stage name.  That\u2019s as far as I know. ",
