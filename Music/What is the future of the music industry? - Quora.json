            "answer_text": "My belief is we are seeing the future play out to a degree right now. Let's take comparison models from the past and then use them against today's reality to get a sense of that. In the 80's/90's, singles were used to set up major releases (you could go back even further but this is my example). The label would execute the \"set up\" with marketing including interviews, video trailers of the band playing or recording in conjunction with major ads running in music publications both industry and fan specific to generate interest and excitement from the industry and fans. Depending on the band the set up could be as little as 2-4 weeks and possibly as long as 8-16 depending on the size of the star. In this example, the artist or band entrusted the label and publicist to control the message and dictate the cadence of the set up. Today, the artist/band can be in total 100% control of their message, their cadence and how they want to promote their recordings. They can do this through a litany of tools/platforms that are sometimes free and sometimes subscription based at a nominal fee. There are some platforms that can help the artist/band do all of these under one roof like Topspin where the artist/band acts entirely as their own label, promotion staff and publicity department. What's more, they are in complete control as to when they release these efforts and to what extent they will run. There is no dictate that tells the artist when their release will come out, and what adjacent releases they might be competing with on a major label roster release schedule.  Sidebar, major labels still to this day release multiple records in a month and weigh the priorities of each as to who and what will get the most coverage and then how the rest of that effort from the various departments will be doled out. It is entirely commonplace that a publicist will be \"working\" 10 releases simultaneously thus subdividing their abilities and attention 10 times (this is true for both major and indy, not specific). It's maddening and a brutal dance for these folks including the promotions people who spend hours each day calling program directors at radio stations to play singles that will promote these releases also handling 10 or more at a time. Back to the set up scenario from yesterday and today. Yesterday the band/artist were subject to major label timelines, priorities, budget allocation and even internal favoritism (for example, if a band is championed by the VP of the label, who do you think is getting more attention that cycle?). Today, if I am a band/artist, I don't deal with these realities.I promote and market my music.I decide when I want to do something.I decide how and when I want to talk about my work.I decide what channels will broadcast and publish my message.More importantly, I am not subject to adjacent priorities.I am the priority. Now that sounds great.But it's a HUGE task to deal with this AND be creative AND write AND record AND perform. So the artist/band of today can hire independents to assist them and build their OWN \"label\" team. It's a lot easier said then done. There are other platforms developing now that many of today's artists are leveraging that I think take the \"set up\" to a whole new level. Because I can reach my fans whenever I want and if they want too they can be dialed into me 24-7 with their pocket computers (smart phones) I can interact with them whenever I want. I can even source a group of these fans and do special promotions with them. Like perform in their living room at a fee. BandPage helps me do this with a sophisticated stack of analytical, promotional and other tools to set up these types of unique promotions. The artist/band can now custom create and curate one off engagements with fans at any level or size in a seemingly endless amount of varieties to assist the set up, the release, or even the tour. It's a remarkable change that puts the artist/band in 100% creative control. I could go on forever about this and I believe these examples are but a couple. Sarah McLachlan talked about streaming and it is definitely the most popular form of Discovery today (Pandora, Spotify, etc). There's also the conversation around \"360 deals\" which deserves its own post frankly. The bottom line is, the future is here. It will now get refined as the years move forward and technology affords the artist and the fan greater access and control over careers. The majors truthfully have nothing to offer artists/bands today outside of past catalog, distribution and the ability to provide a staggering loan in the form a record contract (I have a lot of other opinion about this that you can see if you care \"Should up and coming bands still be trying to get signed to a record label or are they better off going it alone?\"). Because of this I feel that the majors have lost the opportunity and the momentum to deliver a model that today's musicians can utilize. The internet, platforms and freedom of choice in how to leverage these has put the power 100% in the hands of the artist/band today. I don't know what the future iterations on these things will look like , but I do feel that the examples I've given provide a glimpse into where it is now and where it is going. I also think there are other HUGE issues to resolve like ethical distribution of royalties for all broadcast mediums (like streaming) for example. It's going to be very exciting to see how this evolves but in the meantime, the major label model is broken, majors are consolidating, and the old guard is likely struggling with what to do next. I should lastly state these are just my opinions. I don't work inside a major anymore but a lot of friends still do so I have a sense of today's reality. In the end I'm just an observer with a lot of passion for this subject. Quick addendum. I came across a great book by a current industry executive who is clearly embracing change. His name is Steve Gordon and the forward is from Amanda Palmer. Ironically, or not, she echoes a lot of my thoughts and has some additionally great ones. You can see her forward here: THE FUTURE OF THE MUSIC BUSINESS Additional addendum: HUGE news released today (8.13.14) about BandPage and Spotify teaming up: Spotify and BandPage team up to turn music streams into sales. We talk about the future of the business and this is it, or, at least one legitimate future model. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, yeah, of course there will be technology -- loopers, samplers, synthesizers that make more and more realistic sounds. The computer programs that write music and program music will get more and more sophisticated and cheap.  But what will happen to acoustic instruments? What will happen to musicians? Will they all become programmers? Will people stop learning how to play real instruments? Why would we want to hire real musicians when computers can do it almost as well. The only people who will be able to tell the difference are real musicians, and they'll just be complaining because they lost out. Not so fast, buddy. I don't mean to oversell this dystopian version of the future of music, but I think that people tend to get so caught up in technology and the things they can do with technology that they forget about the human element. They forget about artistry. They forget that an audience needs to connect with a musician during live performances, and watching computers generate music, even if you add all the pyrotechnics of a major rock concert, is one big yawn. I think there is going to be a resurgence of anti-technological music and musicianship. There will be a move towards the opposite of programmed music: improvised music. The interplay between musician and musician, instrument and instrument, and the layering of rhythm, harmony, and melody live and on the spot, will become the kind of dancing on the edge that really interests people, once the pyrotechnic technology generated music becomes a big yawn. People make music to communicate with each other. They make music because it is a spiritual experience. It allows them to connect with each other in a transcendent way to become part of something larger than themselves. They play music to lose themselves and forget that they are an individual, alone and disconnected and depressed. Audiences will come to appreciate this kind of music more and more because of the humanity of it. They will appreciate it because they can participate in it. They can bring their drums and be a part of it. They will invite these musicians into their homes for house concerts and the musicians will perform there to connect with people in their native habitat. Museums are like zoos for art. Concerts in large performance spaces are like zoos for music. The art and music displayed or played in these venues is static, because it is out of context. Art and music are made to be lived with, not displayed in museums. Museums have their place as ways of capturing the history of an art, but they can not be a place for creativity. They are too hallowed and stuffy. The future of music will be like the past of music. It will be humanized again, and democratized so that everyone is a musician and we all play together and dance together. The future of music is sweat and emotion. It is taking the energy of an audience, and passing it through your instrument, transforming it into a statement that the audience hears, responds to, and provides new energy for the musician to transform. Over and over and over it happens, through iteration after iteration, each one different and unique and unrecorded.  The future of music will be ephemeral. People will live for the unrecorded and undocumented experience that can live only in their memories, slowly fading as the years pass. In the future, we will all be musicians. ",
