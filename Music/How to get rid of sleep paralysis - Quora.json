            "answer_text": "There is no cure, but there are ways to make it less likely to happen, which I\u2019ll outline below. First, you need to follow a comprehensive sleep hygiene checklist. I have created one (Insomnia Insanity\u2019s Sleep Hygiene Musts). Make sure you do the journaling part before bed, writing out your thoughts, but I also want you to add what you did that day, what and when you ate, and ALL medication, including supplements and OTC meds like aspirin, that you took. And then I also want you to keep a morning journal. You\u2019ll write down how well you slept, any dreams or nightmares you remember, and whether or not you had sleep paralysis. This will be crucial in figuring out what your triggers are. If you are having sleep paralysis more than once a month, you should talk to your doctor about it. It would be worthwhile to get a sleep study done. Make sure to take info about sleep paralysis with you in case your doctor is not familiar with it, or mention that you would like the doctor to know that\u2019s why you will be coming in (so they have time to look it up) when you call to make the appointment. I also recommend getting at least 2 weeks\u2019 worth of data (details in the checklist) and journals beforehand. If you aren\u2019t having it more than once a week, and have no other sleep issues, it is not worth it to take the medications sometimes prescribed (off-label use) for SP. The side effects and risks are just really bad, and they rarely work. What you can do to to help prevent SP: Get the sleep you need. Sleep deprivation is a major trigger for SP. If you sleep well, and stick to a schedule that works for you, you are far less likely to have an episode.Treat what you can. If you have insomnia or another sleep disorder that is causing you to lose sleep, you should seek treatment for that.Don't sleep on your back. 58% of reported episodes of sleep paralysis happen while in the supine position (lying on your back).Avoid alcohol and heavy meals/snacks before bed. All of these can disrupt your sleep and can cause nightmares, which are both triggers for SP.If you find yourself having an episode, there are some ways to try to get out of it. \"This isn't real, it's sleep paralysis.\" Sometimes just realizing that you're having an SP episode can make it stop.Try to go back to sleep. If just realizing it's SP isn't working, try to go back to sleep. Sometimes it's impossible (I certainly can't do it), but others have success with this approach.Change your breathing. Since you can't move most of your body, one of the options to get your brain out of an episode is changing up your breathing. You can try calming, deliberate breaths, exhaling forcefully, or even things like coughing can help snap you out of it.A little movement can go a long way. Blinking rapidly, wiggling fingers and toes, and other similar things can work to help you end an episode.Follow these links for more information on SP: The Waterloo Episodic Sleep Paralysis Study A twin and molecular genetics study of sleep paralysis and associated factors ",

            "answer_text": "Try this just once: The next time you get sleep paralysis, relax. calm down. remember that you are in control and it is your mind playing games with you. remember that it is not going to harm you in any way whatsoever. Instead of fighting the sleep paralysis, let it go on. let it continue. Once you are relaxed and in control and continuously remember that anything scary that you see and hear is your brain trying to grapple with the shock of being completely paralysed. But if you relax, sleep paralysis goes from a scary, demonic, brain invasion to a beautifully lucid, life changing dream experience that beats any drug.  don't take any medicines just for sleep paralysis alone. if that is your only symptom, just try to start enjoying it. it's really very easy (I have had sleep paralysis every day since 2007, not missed a beat yet) and will wake you up feeling better than usual. If you don't fight it and try to wake up immediately, you will wake up in a matter of a few minutes. a few minutes isn't going to change much. remember that if you're scared of the paralysis.  once you get used to this, sleep paralysis becomes a problem when it's not there.

Those who we\u2019ve seen in a darker background in dreams are the creditors including our relatives or anyone we knew who pasted away in this life and the last life, thus people always question about why there are strangers in dreams while actually they were who we were familiar with during the past. Some people may have severe sleeping problems or other health issues than others is because different people have different retributions. Eating vegetarian, stop killing, helping others, donating to temple or church, fish releasing (life liberation) & etc. are creating the good deeds and vise versa.

More women tend to have sleeping problems, having abortions or miscarriage is the main reason as the child spirit will be asking for karmic debts from mom sometimes causing fights between generations. Lots of practitioners just followed the practice transcending child, when child spirit leaves, the sleeping problem, gynecological illnesses and conflicts with husband or partner and the living kid disappeared without taking a pill. 180518 Totem Case: Health and sleep problems due to foreign spirit(karmic creditor)  Spiritual San Francisco Guan Yin Citta ",

The good news is that you can treat it yourself. To get rid of it, 1. Just stay calm and abstain from making an attempt to move or even bat an eyelid when it happens. 2. Follow a good sleep schedule. Be consistent. 3. Avoid caffeine before sleeping. 4. Create a good peaceful environment before going off to sleep. I have been experiencing sleep paralysis for a long time. It\u2019s actually very common among people. But, recently I have found a way to get rid of it. I just stay silent and calm and a minute after, things are normal. I know there is no ghost holding me down and choking my windpipe. Trying to move will only make you more scared and will make things worse if you are very stressed already (which is one of the reasons why you get paralysed while sleeping). Hope this helps! ^_^ ",

Dream paralysis is a very bitter experience to go through; during dream paralysis you can hear strange and frightening voices and see things which are horrible. Why do you go through sleep paralysis no one knows why? Is there a cure? No there is no cure.  The best way to deal with sleep paralysis is to read a lot about it. The more you will know about it the more you will be able to deal with it. Internet is the best place to get more information about it.  In your diet increase intake of fruit have lot of apples, tinned peaches---peaches which are available in tins in supermarkets--- are excellent for those who have sleep paralysis.  Train yourself to relax during experience of dream paralysis no harm will come to you. Tell yourself all this is in your mind.  Also have at least four to six almonds per day. Beside almonds also have dates--two dates per day will be enough.  Dates are rich in vitamin k-- this vitamin is good for balancing the brain chemicals.   If you are allergic to almonds then don't have them. in summer four almonds per day will be enough. Also take up yoga, yoga breathing exercises will be excellent for you. ",

I had a sleep problem called REM disorder which caused to have bizarre, violent dreams where I would thrash around kicking and punching. Medication helped me to curb this behavior and also pretty much stopped nighttime paralysis, but no medication is prescribed specifically for sleep paralysis of (according to my doctor.) I still experience it often when I take naps in the afternoon. My psychiatrist\u2019s answer to that was simple - stop taking naps. (My sleep doctor told me that it has been shown that there is some correlation between sleep paralysis and apnea, but treatment for that did not help with paralysis.) ",

Im scared like anything during n after every such instances. First of all it's very important to understand that it's not a sign of any mental disorder. It's just your sleep cycle messing up with fears of our subconscious minds. Every time you experience such a episode ,try relaxing .and tell yourself \u201cthis is just sleep paralysis, I'm just dreaming.anything around me cannot harm me .it will be over soon.\u201d I mean really keep saying these words loud in your mind,again and again,until you are out of it. At points when I'm completely terrified ,having religiously convenient beliefs saves me. I keep repeating the prayers and slokas to calm myself and in no time I'm out of sleep paralysis.what helped me in my last night sleep paralysis was Gayatri mantra. You can try whatever gives you strength n keeps you calm. So,key here is to Stay Calm amidst worst possible scenarios you might find yourself in. ",

Good thing is it's just a state of unconsciousness between wakefulness and sleep when we cannot move inspite of trying and it isn't harmful to our body. I experienced it once and that time I knew nothing about it and I surely was terrified. It can occur due to many reasons like Lack of sleep.Bipolar disorder.Stress.Change in sleep schedule or place.Narcolepsy .Night time leg cramps.Etc. If it happens once in a while it's fine and happens to most of us. However, if you are constantly getting these, you must consult a sleep disorder specialist. Treatment of any of the reasons above can help to get rid of it. ",

Irregular sleep increases the risk of sleep paralysis. Also, make sure to not sleep belly up on your back, since most episodes of sleep paralysis occur when you do. If you still fall into sleep paralysis and want to get out, first of all, try staying calm and relaxed. What happens isn\u2019t actually real, try and remember that! Then focus intensely on some small body part, like one of your fingers, and try to wiggle it even slightly. Usually you will be able to slightly move it after some tries, and then you might be able to start moving your other fingers, your hand, your arm, until finally, you wake up and escape it. ",

It might seem quite weird but I started to keep pen and paper beside my pillow to resolve this. But I didn't go through sleep paralysis after that for months. I had it once after a long time. Unfortunately, I was not prepared with pen and paper this time. If your case is serious, you should consult someone experienced in this field. I know how dreadful it can be. I am even not sure if it was something else.But luckily it was not persistent in my case. ",
