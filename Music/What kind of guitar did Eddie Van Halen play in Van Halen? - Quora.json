            "answer_text": "Tons! His first famous guitar was a frankensteined strat-style guitar using charvel/boogie bodies parts and a gibson humbucker. He had other frankenstrats with different striped patterns as well. He was an early adopter of Floyd Rose tremolo systems on these early guitars. He had various Gibson and Gibson-style guitars some of which he modified, like the Ibanez Destroyer he sliced a chunk out of. Then there was the Kramer era, where he played Kramer guitars, and he hooked up with Music Man in the early 90\u2019s to great their EVH signature model which is probably the guitar he is most associated with after the striped frankenstrat. Then there was the Peavey Wolfgang, which was highly similar to the Music Man, and then Fender\u2019s version of the Wolfgang, which is what he used most recently. ",

            "answer_text": "He played a few! The one\u2019s he\u2019s famous for are Kramer\u2019s, I think they were his first endorsements? By the time Sammy came along he could be seen with a Steinberger that might\u2019ve been \u201c Live, Without A Net\u201d, it was also in this era and later that endorsements with Ernie Ball and Peavey would come about. I think even to this day you can see him playing guitars designed through the collaboration of both companies which are basically his designs dubbed Wolfgang (his son\u2019s name). I\u2019m not for certain but I think he single handedly put Kramer on the guitar map! He has his own line of stuff called EVH, this would entail from amps to strings. There was a 5150 amp he did with Peavey that was a pretty good amp. He may be making as much money through his collaboration projects with companies as he does musically, his famous Red, White and Black Frankenstein guitar brought him the attention of manufacturers. I think some of them took note, one did see a resurgence in bridge pickup only guitars being introduced back then. There is even somebody selling copies of his Frankenstein guitars for a handsome fee! Eddie was a little brighter than many think, he was more than just an innovative player, he proved to be an innovative designer as well! ",

            "answer_text": "He used several models. On the first album it was mainly an Ibanez Destroyer that Eddie literally destroyed by cutting a chunk out of the guitar. He had to borrow one from Chris Holmes of Wasp to take on the tour. After that, Eddie started building his own guitars. He had some endorsements from Kramer and Charvel but many times he\u2019d just put their logo on his self made \u201cFrankenstrat\u201d. For 5150, he used a headless Steinberger model with a trans trem that allowed him to use the bar to pull the guitar into different keys and lock it in that key for the song. He later (on Balance) started to use expensive signature models made by Ernie Ball. He\u2019s been through deals with Ernie Ball, Peavy and Fender making pretty much the same guitar. He also has his own EVH line of guitars now. ",
