            "answer_text": "I like the question! No. Elvis far outsold the Beatles. Elvis\u2019 record sales have been in excess of 1.7 billion records worldwide and this EXCLUDES Sony\u2019s updated calculations as they have never been audited/modified in over a decade. PLUS Colonel Parker and RCA had some \u201cunique\u201d accounting practices of Elvis\u2019 sales to say the least. Elvis dominated in the categories of; Rock, Gospel and Christmas. His image, likeness, voice, etc. is an American success story - an American bonafide legend - a Worldwide legend - and his recordings continue to sell millions. Unfairly, Elvis lived during the time that the US and World populations were a fraction of what they are now. That there was no such thing as; downloads, streaming, YouTube, Internet, etc. thus the only way - until RCA came out with the \u201cmusic club\u201d whereby they allowed you to buy a few records free and then crushed you on the \u201chave to buy in the future prices\u201d - to buy records/albums was to physically go to the store and physically buy them. I know firsthand as I have lived it for 7 decades. Take care Jeff ",

The funny things is about wrong, unsourced and unfounded answers like that of User-12261226525185864484 is that they underline how great the Beatles\u2019 sales are, compared to the modest amount of years they were active. And when called out he disables comments, that\u2019s a prime example of fanboy rose-tinted glasses versus reality. Let\u2019s be clear - it does not really matter which artist or band sold the most records, it\u2019s all about the enjoyment of the musical legacy. ",
