            "answer_text": "Kanye West is untrustworthy. After all the vile things Donald Trump has said And insinuated about black people, stirring the racial divide, and Kanye still supported him. Joe Biden is a trusted name we can put faith in. Trump has made life hell for black people in this country through his support of white supremacy and his lack of effort to condemn the perpetrators of hate crimes against the black community. Trump is a known racist who praised a David Duke and got mad when protestors wanted to rip down confederate statues of Albert Pike and Robert E Lee. Kanye was paid by Trump to wear that MAGA hat. Kanye is merely an influencer who is used as a PAID advertising tool. If you compare what Colin Kaepernick sacrificed (money, fame, and air time) all for a cause he believed would help his people, to how Kanye betrayed his people by taking money to stick up for a white supremacist, then it is logical to call Kanye an Uncle-Tom. My opinion of Kanye was never high, although it was higher than it is now. I think President Obama got it correct when he said \u201cKanye is a jackass\u201d. I think it is safe to say many, many, people feel the way I do. Kanye is a joke and his purported 2020 presidential campaign is a big time joke too. Who the hell would vote for a man who was (just a couple years ago) handcuffed to a gurney after a stage performance and then involuntarily committed to a mental hospital. Do we really want a president who has openly admitted to being stoned on pain killers and Xanax, most of the day time. Why should we vote for him ? Because he is famous\u2026 because he has a very famous wife? I think it\u2019s safe to say we learned our lesson after electing the lame duck Orange shit sack currently occupying the Oval Office. Famous people don\u2019t always stay relevant. I predict that Kanye and the fame he still has left will fade away so fast. He truly made himself irrelevant by his actions at that concert, followed by his support for Trump and his lame ass fake Christian-rap gospel shows. Go on his Twitter feed, he\u2019s using profanity and not taking about anything holy. How can Christians follow a man who called him self \u201cYesus\u201d. for god sake get lost Kanye West, you mother fucking joke; no pun intended.  ",

            "answer_text": "Please don't vote for Kanye I am pretty left-leaning and am in favour of Biden this election, but I do think this applies to more conservative individuals as well. As many of us are aware, Kanye West has announced his campaign for president. I have noticed many people and even friends of mine supporting him as a meme and ironically, but now, especially under the current political climate, isn't the time to support candidates as a joke. Examining a little deeper, we can probably conclude Kanye doesn't *really* want to be president. What he is, however, is a Trump supporter, despite what entertainment blogs have to say. So, why would Kanye run for president if he supports Trump? Well, he doesn't intend to win, he just wants people that would have otherwise voted for Biden to vote for him as a joke in order to drag down Biden. Kanye, in addition to most likely campaigning halfheartedly and out of if not malicious, then certainly disruptive intent, is much more inexperienced than either Biden or Trump. Biden has had over 30 years of experience in the political field, Trump himself having several years of political work and economic work. Kanye does not have any experience and thus is not a solid candidate to vote for anyways. Finally, voting for Kanye is fostering the notion that votes shouldn't be taken seriously. Voting Kanye as a joke only supports the idea that your vote doesn't matter and goes as far as to practically throw it away. It might be a funny joke now, but your vote could determine your entire future, and voting for the meme is not a smart thing to do ever. In conclusion, I think everyone on both sides, although my opinion is objectively biased, can agree that voting for Kanye, even as a joke, is in support of throwing away your vote and endorses political disruption and I urge people that support Kanye for president memes to please think before you act.
