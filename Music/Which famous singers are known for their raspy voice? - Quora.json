            "answer_text": "According to me Steven Tyler and Hank Williams but there are many others\u2026 My vocal coach/ trainer/ tutor always encourages me to use all the techniques that she teaches me, to put it all into practice. I love to experiment and I love to listen to yodel\u2026. I love a raspy and a husky voiced singer. But I also love singers like Shirley Bassey, Carpenters, Engelbert, Perry Como, John Denver to name a few\u2026 I think, it\u2019s a great feeling to know you have a wonderful voice, but you don\u2019t just want it to be wonderful, you want to do something amazing with that wonderful voice.. !!!! Use it to create a difference, do something unique\u2026 Hope this helps ",
