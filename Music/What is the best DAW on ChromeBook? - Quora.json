            "answer_text": "I actually am on Chromebook and create music so I\u2019ve got pretty much the answer for you. Bandlab, no I\u2019m not recommending you get their products and DAWs, I am recommending bandlab.com. It\u2019s a music sharing platform, it\u2019s got a full comment and sharing system similar to Youtube but much easier to operate since it was made for sharing your epic beats. On the DAW side of things, we\u2019ve got MIDI without restrictions as far as I can tell, the standard ability to plug your bass and guitar in, anything else that supports MIDI can also be plugged in, lovely loops for almost any genre and a lovely interface. That barely scratches the iceberg of Bandlab. I could be blabbering on about this all day without anything I say repeating. Anyways Bandlab is amazing. (this sounds like an ad and I promise it\u2019s not lol) ",

            "answer_text": "That's an excellent question! Since CromeBooks are not very powerful, I would recommend a little known program called Mixcraft. It's not CPU or RAM intensive since it comes in 64 and 32 bit. Also, it has a fully featured month long demo, so you can test it to make sure it works. It takes external VST's like any other DAW, is Midi keyboard compatable, has a performance mode, and it's pretty simple to learn. It can also edit video and has a sheet music writing mode along with the standard piano roll that most DAWs have. I would give it a try!Here is a link to the page with all the info:http://www.acoustica.com/mixcraft/Minimum Requirements:http://www.acoustica.com/mixcraft/mixcraft-system-requirements.php ",
