            "answer_text": "Oh, my, yes. What is the best song by a well known artist that most people have never heard? I\u2019ve been collecting albums and songs from artists I love since I was old enough to know who who was. It\u2019s been a labor of love, gathering the tunes from here or there, buying soundtracks, collections, etc., just to get one track or other by this artist or that to round out my collection. So, starting with the first time I did such a thing, this is a list of tunes I think many haven\u2019t heard, but the hardcore collectors among you have. They\u2019re not in any real order, just as I thought of them. Enjoy\u2026 Elton John: \u201cMichelle\u2019s Song\u201d (from Friends, 1971)  Phil Collins: \u201cWhich Way The Wind Blows\u201d (from Anthony Phillips The Geese And The Ghost, 1977)  Sting: \u201cNuclear Waste\u201d (from Fast Breeders & The Radio Actors, 1978)  Peter Gabriel: \u201cWalk Through The Fire\u201d (from Against All Odds Original Soundtrack, 1984)  Steve Winwood: \u201cCrossing The Line\u201d (from Go, 1976)  Sinead O\u2019Connor: \u201cHarbour\u201d (from 18 by Moby, 2002)  Annie Haslam (of Renaissance): \u201cRipples\u201d (from Supper\u2019s Ready, 2006)  Mark Knopfler: \u201cAtlantis\u201d (from A Tribute To Hank Marvin & The Shadows, 1996)  David Gilmour, Bob Geldof & Chrissie Hynde: \u201cChicago\u201d (from Keep Gary McKinnon Free, 2009)  Jon Anderson: \u201cDon\u2019t Make Me Blue\u201d (from The Warriors, 1964)  Enjoy\u2026.

Other one I'd like to add is just about any song from The Who, since everyone knows the title theme songs from the CSI franchise; all of which use songs from The Who. Here's one classic rock tune from their legendary album Who's Next.   ",
