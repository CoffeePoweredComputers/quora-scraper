            "answer_text": "Yes and No. Apple expects you to buy their apps sometime or the other. With that expectation, for apps such as Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X Apple by default installs system files important to run those apps during OSX is setup. Once you install any of these applications, you cannot un-install them other than just deleting them, leaving orphaned files on the your computer that with time might simply slow down. So be careful if you don\u2019t want these apps in your MAC, do not install them. Many applications regardless of them being developed for any platform (OSX, Windows, Ubantu etc), they run background processes after installing, that can slow down your system. Un-installing them can be a painful time wasting process. ",
