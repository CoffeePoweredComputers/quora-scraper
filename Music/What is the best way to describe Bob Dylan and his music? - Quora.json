            "answer_text": "Well, I can say one word for Bob Dylan and his music: Absurdity. 1. Bob Dylan\u2019s Music I admire his music, and I respect him as one of the best songwriters of our time. Since he is a Nobel Prize winner for his lyrics and songs, there is no doubt about it. 2. Bob Dylan I don\u2019t appreciate him as a singer. I wish he could remain as a great songwriter only rather than a singer-songwriter. I only can appreciate his music when it\u2019s performed by other singers than Bob Dylan. As David Bowie described his voice, it sounds like sandpaper grinding iron plate. Also, I doubt his singing skill. I believe most of the average amateur singers can sing much better than him. Syd Crimston's answer to Who's an overrated singer that actually can't sing at all? Finally, I hope this answer gives you what I think about songwriters who can\u2019t sing well. Syd Crimston's answer to A&R people, should I move to Nashville and pursue a career in music at 56? However, I think I\u2019m wrong when I see Bob Dylan\u2019s success as a singer as well. I believe his music surpasses his inability of singing technique and sandpaper-like voice. So, the best way to describe Dylan\u2019s music and Dylan would be like a Schr\u00f6dinger's cat ( Schr\u00f6dinger's cat - Wikipedia ). Absurdity is the only word I can describe Bob Dylan and his music. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say that Dylan is the man who used music to re-vitalize poetry to the 20th century.  Songs are to be sung, and Dylan is a songwriter. However, the lyrics have the heft of poetry. They make you take the language into account in its fullness. Just for fun, consider the what the Ancient Greeks thought of as the fundamental \u201cMuses\u201d: Calliope, the Muse of epic poetry.Clio, the Muse of history.Erato, the Muse of lyric poetry.Euterpe, the Muse of music.Melpomene, the Muse of tragedy.Polyhymnia, the Muse of sacred poetry.Terpsichore, the Muse of dance and chorus.Thalia, the Muse of comedy and idyllic poetry.(Who Were the Nine Muses of Greek Mythology?) Dylan liberated music from lyrical limitation by incorporating many more of these elements. Previously, music lyrics had become somewhat trapped by predictable themes. He also has a knack for using simple-seeming chord progressions that remain directly approachable despite their surprising turns and that he embellishes with the ambiguity of his singing. Tangled Up in Blue is a great example of this last point. As he said himself though, there is a sincerity in his approach that makes his music expansive to other musicians. There is something about his work that makes other musicians like myself want to keep going, to push the envelope, see how far we can go. Like the Beatles, despite the epic output and ground covered, his music is not limiting or conclusive: it is inspirational and encouraging. Not encouraging in a saccharine way, but in the fundamental way: it instills courage. Finally, as he said himself: \u201cyou want your song to sound good.\u201d That is about the best advice I ever got on songwriting. ",
