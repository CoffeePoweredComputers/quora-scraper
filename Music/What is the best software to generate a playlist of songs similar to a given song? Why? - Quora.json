            "answer_text": "The answer depends a whole lot on what you are looking for in the \"best\" service. Assuming you are looking for a streaming radio service such as Spotify, Pandora or the recent ITunes Radio, here are some comparison points to look for, to help you decide which service suits you best. Considering strictly audio quality, Spotify trumps both ITunes Radio and Pandora, for the paid versions, with the following streaming bit rates:Spotify: upto 320 kbpsITunes Radio: upto 256 kbps (estimate)Pandora: upto 192kbps. For free accounts, Pandora is noticeably sub-par with a rate of 64kbps. So if you are using high quality headphones, you are bound to notice the difference. However, if you aren't that much into bit-rates and are more concerned with the playlist that is generated for a particular artist seed, from my personal experience, I have noticed that Pandora generates the best playlist, with a wider range of variety and more consideration towards your personal choice inputs. Spotify focuses more on the one artist you have given as seed and does not do as good a job of finding similar music. I haven't experimented with ITunes Radio much, but I would assume from the fact that Pandora has been around much longer, that it generates a more wholesome mix of music for the artist you seeded.  Again, the answer is based heavily on my own assumptions and my own personal choices. I use Spotify heavily, owing to good audio quality and its play-on-demand feature.
