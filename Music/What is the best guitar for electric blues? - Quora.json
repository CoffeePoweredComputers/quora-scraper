            "answer_text": "First of all, when looking for a guitar for any genre you should first consider what your influences play. Which guitarists do you admire? Which model of guitar they prefer? This can point you in the direction of the tone you're looking for. If you're looking for that BB King tone you'll be in the market for a semi-hollow. On the other hand, if you want to sound like SRV or even Buddy Guy for that matter, you'll be looking to buy a Fender Stratocaster. With this basic advice out of the way, I'll sum a few popular choices: 1. Fender Stratocaster: Known for glassy, bell-like tones, the strat is the most popular guitar design around. Since it's debut in 1954 it has seen relatively little change to the core design - a testament to the brilliant work of Leo Fender. Though modern strats have a flatter neck radius and generally friendlier neck profiles, the basic formula is still the same: Alder/Ash body, three low output single coils, maple neck and rosewoord or maple fingerboard. Notable users: SRV, Buddy Guy, Eric Claption, Jimi Hendrix, John Mayer. 2. Semi-Hollow: Known for mellow, some might say \"Bluesy\" tone, semi-hollows nail that warm but glassy tone (if this description makes any sense to you). The most popular models are probably the Gibson ES-335 and similar. I've had a Gibson ES-339 for a while - terrific option if this is the vibe you're after. Notable users: BB King, Freddie King, Chuck Berry, Marty McFly. 3. Les Paul: The Les Paul is widely recognized as a \"Rock'N'Roll\" guitar but it works exceptionally well for blues too. Whether it's Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton, Peter Green or Gary Moore playing it, the Les Paul outputs a mean, punchy, sustaining tone to die for. 4. SG: The Gibson SG makes me think of Angus Young (ACDC) more than anything else, but the guitar works very well for bluesy applications. Clapton in Cream comes to mind, while not purist blues, it's bluesy as hell. Derek Trucks is another notable user. 5. PRS Guitars: Some consider PRS guitars as a natural evolution of the Les Paul. Other than being downright gorgeuos, PRS guitars are very versatile guitars capable of being as bluesy as you want. Worth checking out. John Mayer is playing these lately to great effect. 4. Super Strat (Ibanez, Jackson, various others): I admit this is not the first choice for blues. However, if you look past the \"modern\" look, you get a very versatile and very comfortable instrument. The Ibanez JS series paticularly come to mind. 5. Flying V: Albert King played these to great success.  All in all, get down to your local store and play anything that catches your eye. You might be surprised. ",

            "answer_text": "What is the best guitar for electric blues?  I would suggest the same thing I suggest to new pleyers in general. That is a Strat/Telly style guitar with at least a single coil neck pickup and a humbucker bridge. You can make the single coil \u201cring\u201d beautifully as some styles sort of require you to, and can switch to the humbucker for a bit more growl. Among others, I have a really cheap Strat copy I paid $70 for (70 actual Dollars, I still cannot believe it) with two single coils and a humbucker that has a switch (in case I want the sound of a 3 single coil strat) to change the tone. The only thing I had to do was to use some light sandpaper to the frets on the side of the neck (they were a bit sharp) and I adjust the action and tone. My next thing to do is to rewire it, but otherwise it sounds great and at least as good as my more expensive guitars. I really bought it because I wanted to practice my luthier skills on something I didn\u2019t have to take a second mortgage to buy, but more and more I find myself going to it when I feel like playing the blues. In fact, just today I bought a Jazz like bass from the same company for a whole of $80. My bass is an acoustic and there are things I want to learn that the acoustic is not suitable for. So there. Single coil and humbucker in a neat package and if you don\u2019t like it get a drill and a couple of deck screws and hang it on the wall. You\u2019ll be out less than a decent dinner for two. ",
