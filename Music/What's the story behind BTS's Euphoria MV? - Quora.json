            "answer_text": "These are my theories: Jin acts as a guardian angel of bts and travels through time in order to save the members from dying in the hyyh era. Euphoria starts with tae s scene from prologue where he jumps from a tower structure. Jin tries to.reverse time to save him. The inverted colours in the mv shows that he is reversing time. Then Jin is shown in a room where he looks through a window and sees Suga s apartment on fire. He places jungkook to drag him out of there and save him. He tries to save Tae from killing his father by replacing him with Jhope. Jin replaces tae s bloody hands with flower petals. That all the changes he makes then the scene cuts and they appear in a bright setting where everything is back to normal and that's utopia for bts! When Jin replaces Tae s father with Jhope, Jimin is left alone in the mental facility. To cope up with it Jimin imagines everyone but then he has to face reality in which he is all alone. When jimin opens the door it shows that he is in heaven. In simple words Jin messed up.and another member died. Back to the euphoria scenes ; Jin is always singled out and the rest of the members aren't acknowledging him and when jin joins the members the scene darkens. The omelas is a fictional utopia where everything is perfect and happy but in reality this prosperity requires a single child to be kept in darkness and misery. This parallel continues on when history starts to repeat itself and members are back at the tower structure. Jin is the one who sacrificed his life so the others can stay alive and remain happy in utopia. He replaces Tae and jumps off the tower structure. When he jumps the scene of Tae jumping in the water reverses showing it didn't happen anymore. The bright light shown represents that Jin is now in heaven after jumping. The video focuses on utopia verses reality!! Hope this helpes :)))) ",

            "answer_text": "BTS (\ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8) Euphoria is story connected to HYYH (The most beautiful moments in life/HwaYangYeonHwa) and YNWA (You Never Walk alone) it can also be connected to Love Yourself: Highlight reels and Wings. Its theorized all the music and music videos are connected to one overall stories relating to bts past self or alternate selves. Some say Euphoria is very reminiscent of their old videos that relate to things like: youth, hardships, friendship, love, loss and mental health. The overall theory can be seen all over: I need u, Run, Love Yourself: Highlight reels, Serendipity and BTS Wings short stories. Euphoria is meant to another parallel world that somehow connects to the main BTS story line (HYYH) where nothing bad happened to the boys. In HYYH/LYHR/LY/FY/Euphoria. bts which through several deaths and story lines (theory\u2019s or opinions about it below) (Some didn\u2019t happen by I assumed and gave my opinion) Kim Seokjin (Jin): During HYYH he is known to be separated from the rest and probably works as a photographer or just like photography in general. Some say he\u2019s a time traveler that witness his friends dying multiple times and using flowers to communicate to parallel worlds to stop whatever went wrong. Min Yoongi (Suga): It\u2019s clear he\u2019s very close to Jeon Jungkook and might be in a relationship with him where they argue lot and eventually break up. It said during that time Min Yoongi breaks the law and witnesses Jungkook\u2019s car accident were he\u2019s announced as dead causing depression to Yoongi which leads to suicide. Jung Hoseok (J-Hope): Hoseok is a college student who works in a dance studio were he meet Park Jimin and Shin Ryu Jin. During this time Hoseok deals with lots of negative thinks such as his mother leaving him when he was 5 years old. However, Hoseok is also addicted to pain killers and ignores everything around him to work harder to prove to his mama. Kim Namjoon (RM): Namjoon is very close to Kim Taehyung who offers sleeps over at his house and hangs out with him the most. The two boys often get into trouble with the law (Spray painting and getting arrested) until one day they just stop talking as Taehyung had gotten arrested and was due for trial. Namjoon did the best for Taehyung by sending him to away and deleting all contact. Park Jimin (Jimin): Jimin who always stayed late hours practicing with Hoseok was afraid to tell Hoseok that he secretly had a crush on Shin Ryu Jin (Hoseok\u2019s Girlfriend/Crush) but during this time he gotten insecure and committed suicide once knowing Hoseok and Ryu were officially dating. Kim Taehyung (V): Kim Taehyung\u2019s sister was being abused by their father and couldn\u2019t take it anymore as he tried reporting the crime yet nobody did anything about it not even Namjoon his best friend. Taehyung went crazy after getting arrested several times and decided to stab his father feeling guilty right after and tried running away from it. Kim Taehyung then jumps to his death. Jeon Jungkook (Jungkook): After the breakup with Yoongi\u2026 Jungkook goes looking for trouble as he gets beat up then ran over by one of his friends causing him to be rushed to the hospital by Hoseok. He never speaks to Yoongi again as he\u2019s dead. Jungkook stays alive for several months until death brings his faith. - In Euphoria/HR, Jin saves everyone by time travel expect Park Jimin. Here\u2019s what happened in this reality. Kim Seokjin: (Highlight Reels) {Jin meets a girl who drops a mysterious book}, Jin does not run over Jungkook, Jin jumps to his death to protect Taehyung. (In Depth: Jin is the one that killed Jungkook but in this reality he instead doesn\u2019t as Jungkook saves Yoongi instead. Jin jumps to his death within seconds of getting footage which doesn\u2019t alarm anyone as they don\u2019t even notice as Jin slowly erases from history. Taehyung notices though) Min Yoongi: (Highlight reels) {Min Yoongi meets a musician who he writes songs for using the piano}, Suga does not die and instead is saved in the fire from Jungkook they realize how stupid they\u2019re for breaking up and intend on reconnecting. The downside is Jungkook gets addicted to cigarettes instead of Yoongi getting addicted. Jung Hoseok: Once collapsing onto the ground Hoseok and his friends send him to a hospital to recover. He meets Jimin and they become friends. Kim Namjoon: He meets up with Jin and they become in contact again not much is known about him in the universe expect his helping the earth (seen in Highlight Reels) Park Jimin: Jimin is left in the hospital alone after Hoseok leaves after getting recovered. All that are left is his memories of his friends before accident. Kim Taehyung: He still hangs out with Namjoon expect they don\u2019t get in trouble anymore and Taehyung didn\u2019t kill his father instead he hanged out with Hoseok who reported his father. Taehyung is aware of Jin\u2019s time traveling effects. Jeon Jungkook: Is addicted to Cigars and is trying to quiet with the help of Namjoon. Jungkook is currently having a close relationship with Yoongi and continues to remember those times. Expect as he stands on a building rooftop is it\u2019s hints that he\u2019s remembering those times and he might commit suicide.
