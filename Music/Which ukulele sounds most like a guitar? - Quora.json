            "answer_text": "The baritone ukulele sounds most like a guitar. It is a larger instrument, but will still be higher than a guitar in general. The tuning also matches that of guitar in the four strings match the top four of the guitar. A bass ukulele is essentially the same as a base guitar, though you can get special bass instruments that are much smaller and use very thick strings. ",

            "answer_text": "Easily the baritone ukulele. It's the largest of the ukes and is tuned like the top four strings of a guitar in standard tuning (D-G-B-E low to high). Kinda like a small, short scaled tenor guitar with nylon strings and comfortable string spacing. ",
