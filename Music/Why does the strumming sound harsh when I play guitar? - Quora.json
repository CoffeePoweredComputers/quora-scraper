            "answer_text": "Strumming plays a key role in enhances the chord progressions one play so it has to be flawless and pleasing to the ear, especially if you sing along while playing. There could be many reasons why the strumming might sound harsh. 1. The pick or plectrum should be appropriately held. It plays a very important role in strumming. If held to tight or too lose the strumming would sound harsh. 2. Ensure that the guitar is tuned. Even if one string is slightly untuned the strumming might come across as out of tune and might sound displeasing. 3. Ensure that your fingers do not touch other strings while playing open position chords. ",

            "answer_text": "It all depends on how you hold your guitar pick when you strum. If you're just starting to learn, it will take some time to control the intensity of your strumming. To get that control, hold your pick with your index finger and thumb.   Tilt the pick to a slight angle by bending your thumb backwards as shown below while holding the pick. This leaves the rest of your fingers free, making it easier to do tapping techniques with your middle and/or ring finger.  While strumming, this will allow the pick to glide smoothly over the strings and it will sound less harsh.  I also suggest you try different picks with different thickness and playing surfaces to find out which suits your needs.  ",
