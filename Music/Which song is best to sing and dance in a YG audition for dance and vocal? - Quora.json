            "answer_text": "I would suggest singing a Kpop song would work well; (if you can\u2019t sing Kpop songs don\u2019t choose it if you are not confident enough). Sing something which suits your voice like if you are good at singing high- pitch choose a high pitch one. For singing I would suggest not choosing a song which is from YG because then if you sing something wrong they can easily point out the mistake but if you choose a song from an another agency then they can\u2019t easily point out the mistake unless it\u2019s a huge one. If you are singing an english song then I would suggest you choose something that suits your personality again. For me I personally think that choosing a song that is not so popular you won\u2019t get judged much because they don\u2019t know the complete process of it. For Dance I would suggest the same choosing a song choreography that is not so popular and something hard would do if you could manage because then they know you are capable of doing something hard. I would also recommend to choose something that has less speed while dancing because if it\u2019s not fast then you will have time to think. It would also be best if you could come up with your own choreography. But still it\u2019s hard so you only have to do it if you are confident enough. Hope you get it:) ",

            "answer_text": "Since YG\u2019s main group is BLACKPINK (atm), I think these are some BP songs you should try: WhistleThis song is not a hard song to sing to or dance. The vocals are more easier to express from your own feelings and stand out in with the rest of the song. The dance is very lively and fits with a lot of people in general. Playing with fireAgain, it\u2019s very easier to add your twist onto this song. This song requires powerful vocals since it\u2019s a very hype song but in general it\u2019s very easy to express. The dancing is also not a very advanced one so it\u2019s easy to express your skills more. How you like thatTheir newest song. This might leave a better impression since it\u2019s a new song and they want to promote this song. This might be great since the vocals are softer for the verses compared to all the other songs I suggested and it\u2019s easier to express. Dancing is pretty easy, just need some general energy and there you go! Hope this helped! ~L. ",
