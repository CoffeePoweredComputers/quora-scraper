With the concept of youth that they bring, they want to be a symbol that would deny all criticisms and common stereotypes that are faced by teenagers like bullets. That\u2019s why the \u201cschool trilogy\u201d concept lasted for 2 years since BTS\u2019s debut. School. This is where all the common problems for teenagers.   The name BTS indicates the role of every member in protecting the values of teenagers. In July 2017, it is announced that BTS will also stand for Beyond The Scene. The members of BTS who is growing, will go beyond the reality that they face. Eventually, they will go further. So, to conclude. BTS brought the name \u201cBTS\u201d because they aim to bring justice. And now, we witness how their dream is achieved in a process.

So many contributions on behalf of them. Their video, pictures, dance and singing may distinguish even 1 percent of sadness and anger, but it would be enough. A hope that BTS will always be BTS. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm not actually sure if they're real. There's been rumors that they do exist somewhere in Korea, but to be honest it could be a myth. I think that BTS are just imaginary characters that are just a representation of what a perfect ideal group is. They say BTS has a storyline but I think that this storyline is made up by directors to appeal for little kids or teens to give them hope. I personally think that they don't exist; they're just made up characters. I think this because their music videos, their person themselves, and dances just seem to surreal and bizarre to exist in reality. I mean think about it, how in the hell is it possible to be born as an anime character just like how v in DNA looked like? Or how Jimin in blood sweat and tears looked like? There's no way someone in reality would look like them whatsoever. The reason you see BTS the way you see them in music videos is just really good cgi and animation. Like I said before, they probably do exist, but I highly doubt they actually do. If what I'm saying is actually true, which I probably am, then I'm sorry to break it to you, armies, but your favorite boy band isn't real. They're just a concept. ",
