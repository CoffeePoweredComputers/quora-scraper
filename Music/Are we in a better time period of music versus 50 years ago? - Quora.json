            "answer_text": "At most times in the last fifty years the average person in the United States had access of some sort to music from the last 300 years in some form or other; so the idea of a Better Music Time is questionable - what does it mean? If it means \u201cwere the new songs better than the old ones?\u201d, well, fifty years ago was 1969. Beatles; Crosby, Stills & Nash; Joni Mitchell; Simon & Garfunkel, Bob Dylan - popular musicians who still perform today, or would if they were still alive. Their songs explored a huge variety of topics in daily life, in politics, in imaginary worlds - it was an amazing time of musical exploration. No music ruled supreme - not even Elvis and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. Today there are music writers around the world doing all sorts of wonderful things. There are so many, and so spread out, that it is hard for anyone to know what is going on in that context, and make any kind of comparison. All generations produce geniuses and exceptional talents. We have more easy ability to find them today, but many more half-talents to plod through to get to them. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely! 50 years ago was 1970. I became interested in jazz in the 1950s, at a time when the only way to hear it was to go to a live performance or to buy a phonograph record. Fortunately, this was about the time 78s were giving way to LPs and HiFi. The listening situation was about the same up to and through the 1970s, and by then I had accumulated about 1200 vinyl LPs. Then, in 1982, came CDs, which were a revolution in terms of convenience and quality (whatever they may say about vinyl, all my records had clicks and pops, and they were the best of the best). But I still had to mount expeditions to the big cities to get them, or to experience much in the way of live performance. Fast forward to the present and the ascendance of the internet. I now live in Thailand and have far, far better access to music of all kinds, from anywhere in the world, that I or anybody else could imagine 50 years ago. Or even 20. It doesn\u2019t matter what kind of music, it\u2019s all there and can be called up in a few seconds. Is the quality of music being produced these days better than it was 50 years ago? It doesn\u2019t matter, if you don\u2019t like it you can easily listen to what you do like, whatever your favorite period and genre is, cleaned up and sounding better than ever. ",

            "answer_text": "There are so many more facilities for anyone to become an expert, to promote their abilities as well as professionally present what they have done. In one word, \u201cinternet\u201d. Quora is a platform for sharing knowledge. We communicate worldwide in a second through the internet for so many different purposes. Computer technology has enabled the composer to produce engraved scores to publishable standard as well as make high level recordings. Is there a downside? Yes! Inevitably there is also a surfeit of unmitigated crap and this can make the search for genuine value more time absorbing. Another negative by-product of the \u201cdemocratising\" of the internet is that the mediocrity already referred to can so jade the palette that we even embrace the second rate as worthy, demeaning thereby both intellectual and aesthetic concepts. But, every new technology has pros and cons and on balance I think that the internet has been an utterly invaluable resource for music that 50 years ago simply wasn' t available. ",

Sorry, chaps. That was the time. And you can hear it in today\u2019s music. My children play me the stuff they\u2019re listening to and there is a hugely atavistic element to a lot of it - you can hear the tropes and manners even today. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. NB: I listen to classical. 1970 was the very beginning of Minimalism (Einstein on the Beach, the seminal work of the movement, wasn't first performed until 1976). Serialism, music concrete, stochasticism, postmodernism, and similar austere approaches were still ascendant. It required intense concentration and dedication to listen to and appreciate the music of the time. Things are better now. Tonality and melodicism are back with a vengeance. The music is accessible and enjoyable, yet still challenging and intriguing. It's a great time to be a classical music fan! ",
