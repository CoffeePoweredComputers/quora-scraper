            "answer_text": "The story of Jason Everman. Born in Alaska in 1967, Jason Everman joined Nirvana as a guitarist in February of 1989, shortly after \u2018Bleach\u2019 was recorded (he did not play on the album but appears on the cover). Everman went on tour in \u201889 to support the \u2018Bleach\u2019 release, and can be seen and heard on some bootlegs from the era. Amid tensions within the band, a remaining portion of the tour was canceled and Everman left the band around July of \u201889. Shortly after, Soundgarden\u2019s bassist Hiro Yamamoto left the band, and after auditioning, Jason Everman was Soundgarden\u2019s new bassist, just in time for Soundgarden\u2019s rigorous touring schedule of that time, criss-crossing North America and Europe. Following the tour, Everman was dismissed from Soundgarden after identity tensions developed. After a couple years of playing in a couple bands (OLD, and Mind Funk), Everman, who had always had interest in the military, left music to join up in 1993. Everman went on to serve in the US Army\u2019s 2nd Ranger Battalion, moving on to serve in the Special Forces. Everman was honorably discharged in 2006. That wasn\u2019t enough for this legend, as he earned a degree from Columbia University in philosophy in 2013. Now, Everman plays music in a band of military veterans known as Silence & Light. So this man, Jason Everman, was in Nirvana, Soundgarden, served his country honorably, and is now a degree holder from a prestigious university and makes great music. What a legend. And what a story. His story.  ",

            "answer_text": "Grunge music or Seattle sound (as it is called in some cases) is a style of awesome music that has components of underground rock and hefty metal. It began in the mid 1980s in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, particularly in the conditions of Washington and Oregon. It turned out to be more well known in the mid 1990s. Grunge tunes regularly had verses with skepticism, gloom, despondency, or lack of concern as topics. The inescapable utilization of heroin as a recreational medication discovered its way into the verses and vocations of various grit rockers, eminently Kurt Cobain and Layne Staley of \"Alice in Chains\".
