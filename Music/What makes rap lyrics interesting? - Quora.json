            "answer_text": "I personally like lyrics where the rapper reflects on his life/lifestyle.  The more personal and unique to that rapper, the better. For example, Mobb Deep in \"Give up the goods\": Havin' cash is highly addictiveEspecially when you used to have no money to live withI thought step back look at my life as a whole Ain't no love it seems the devil done stole my soul Or in \"shook ones\": sometimes I wonder do I deserve to liveor am I going to burn in hell for all the things I didno time to dwell on that 'cause my brain reacts Or Nas' recent album where he talks about raising his daughter (Daughters (Nas song)) and problems with Kelis.  It's very personal, but it's uniquely Nas and his life and his reflection on it.  I find it really compelling. Or even the common lyrics on the love/discovery/relationship with hip hop.  I particularly enjoy Joell Ortiz's \"Food for Thought\"  Admittedly, I like lyrics that I can relate to or that remind my of my hood or flat out shout out where i'm from as well, but that's more a personal thing that clearly doesn't apply to most rappers. I can get into some of the more technical side of lyricism.  But that would probably really lead into more of a discussion about flow than content. But it really depends on mood.  As uttered by Big Pun:  From that hardcore shit..To that commercial shit..To that party shit..That thug shit..That live shit, that cry shit..That love shit, that hate shit.. There's example of each that I really like. ",
