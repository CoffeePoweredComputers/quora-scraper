Those songs are \u201cMy Bonnie\" (in which the band backed Tony Sheridan), \u201cAin't She Sweet\", \u201cCry For A Shadow\", \u201cSearchin'\", \u201cThree Cool Cats\", \u201cThe Sheik of Araby\", \u201cLike Dreamers Do\", \u201cHello Little Girl\", \u201cBesame Mucho\", and \u201cLove Me Do\" (although this was not the version the Beatles released as their first hit single, the version released in the U.S. features session drummer Andy White and their is a version with Ringo Starr that was released in the U.K.. As a single and featured on \u201cPast Masters\"). If one wants to get a flavor of what the Beatles sounded like in their early Liverpool/Hamburg days, the tracks on Anthology with Pete Best are a good example of their playing and style from that era.
