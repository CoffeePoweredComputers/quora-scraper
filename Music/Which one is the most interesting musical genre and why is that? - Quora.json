            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think I can give you just one answer for this one. Personally, I find that the diversity of the genre makes it more interesting. For me, that\u2019d be rock (60s-early 90s/present) and classical (1600-mid 20th century). And I\u2019ll tell you why. We will start with rock since it\u2019s more familiar to most people. Rock is a genre which spans over 50 years, and throughout those decades came many different sounds and subgenres, such as soft rock, hard rock, metal, death metal, pop rock, and songs which divulged and merged into different genres to create jazzier or more eccentric music. Queen was one such band and made many examples of that through \u201cgenre-bending.\u201d Other popular examples of varied rock genres are Billy Joel, David Bowie, Elton John, Elvis, Chuck Barry, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, The Who, etc. There\u2019s an endless number of bands and thousands of songs, of which many are very different from one another. I would say that rock is extremely interesting and diverse a genre, and provides a lot of material for introspection and inspection, especially with the lyrics of the songs. Classical music is equally or more diverse, as this genre (really 3\u20134 in one that we jointly call \u2018classical\u2019) spans over 400 years. The genres which make it up are the baroque, rococo (oftentimes overlooked), classical, romantic, and neo-classical periods. Each of these is vastly different sounding from the other. Baroque is very elegant and seems very regal and something old kings would listen to, and rococo is like late baroque/early classical. Classical is audibly similar to baroque, but more dense and livelier (thanks, Mozart). It is also features vibrato (to mimic the human voice) in the strings, and the emotions composers conveyed were more obvious (from what my ear hears). Romantic blossomed from classical, and one prime example of how it evolved was through Beethoven\u2019s symphonies. He was way ahead of his time and, if you were to go through all nine of his symphonies, you would notice that from the first to the ninth, there is a gradual shift in how his music sounds. The music was heavier and more densely orchestrated; there were strong melodic lines and motifs throughout pieces, and eventually symphonies grew to be the popular pieces on the programs of concerts (concertos were more popular beforehand in the previous two eras of classical). Generally the classical sound stops after his third symphony, and we consider the rest the very start of the romantic period of music. Other very prominent romantic composers were Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Dvorak, Saint-Saens, Schumann, and Schubert. Neo-classical is actually after this in the early 20th century and features more eerie, consonant sounds. Shostakovich and Prokofiev were well known in this era. Well known baroque composers included J.S. Bach, Handel, Vivaldi, Corelli, Telemann, and Purcell. Famous classical composers include Mozart, Boyce, Scarlatti, Haydn, Salieri, and four of Bach\u2019s sons. Some runner-up genres are jazz and popular music from the early 20th century. Very fun to listen to and begs you to dance (if your\u2019e into that). Hope that helped. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a good question, and certainly one can can spawn tons of debate. But for my money, and for the purposes of not writing a novel here, I\u2019m going to say that heavy-metal is by far the most interesting genre of music today. For starters, a lot of metal music hinges on execution, and the musicians performing it typically must be very proficient with their instruments. Whether it\u2019s speed, technicality, theory, or songwriting, many aspects of metal have a layer of complexity not found in other genres, in my opinion. So while it may not be the most accessible style of music for the masses, and as a result, not the preferred genre for many, if the listener is honest and objective, he or she cannot deny the playing abilities of those performing it. The closest things that I would cite to this style in terms of sheer complexity and execution, are either classical music, progressive rock, or some of the incredible electronic music that\u2019s out there today. Everything else simply sounds, well, simple by comparison. Perhaps the best way I could paint the picture would be to say that a lot of metal bands could probably cover 90% of popular music, but a far lower percentage of musicians creating popular music could cover most metal bands. For instance, take a group like Imagine Dragons. I\u2019ve heard them categorized as a rock band (which is a stretch). Compare them to any number of metal acts today, from Mastodon or Behemoth, to Meshuggah or Baroness. Imagine Dragons simply doesn\u2019t have the chops to play songs by those bands, or at least nothing that they play gives any indication that they could. And yet, that band has enjoyed more commercial success than any of the four I mentioned, probably combined. But that\u2019s a separate issue for another discussion. Another reason why I would select metal, is the seemingly infinite amount of sub-genres that have been spawned from the genre\u2019s roots. The term \u201cheavy metal,\u201d in today\u2019s world, is nothing more than an umbrella term, a general identifier for harder, more extreme music. While the origins of metal can be debated, and some will cite Cream, Deep Purple, or even Blue Cheer and Iron Butterfly as helping shape the genre, for the purposes of this answer (and not to take anything away from these other bands), I\u2019m going to pick Black Sabbath as the first, true, quintessential metal band. Their 1970 self-titled debut is the first heavy metal record; crushing, distorted guitar riffs, lyrics dabbling in evil, occult-ish themes, doom-laden atmosphere, and CD cover artwork that still spooks me to this day, it has all the ingredients that countless metal bands have used since. For the first 10\u201315 years of its existence, the term \u201cheavy-metal\u201d was sufficient to describe music of this type. But during the early to mid 80\u2019s, we begin to see a divergence in sound, where bands were getting away from the traditional, bluesier sounds of metal that were itself an extension of rock and roll, and taking on a new form. Thrash metal was born from the influences of bands from the \u201cNew Wave of British Heavy Metal\u201d (Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Motorhead, Diamond Head, to name a few) and punk (Discharge, the Ramones, the Sex Pistols), taking the melodic elements, arrangements, and virtuosity from the former, and the aggression, power chords, and attitude from the latter. Bands like Metallica, Slayer, Exodus, and Anthrax pioneered this newer form of metal, arguably the first real split in metal history which came to be known as thrash. It didn\u2019t take long for further splits to occur. Death metal hit the scene by \u201887, named after the pioneers of this second sub-genre of metal, Tampa, Florida\u2019s legendary band Death (though some would argue the band Possessed\u2019s debut album Seven Churches is the first death-metal record, having released in \u201885). It took some elements of thrash, but dialed down the speed and the melody to create an even heavier version of its main influence, while dealing with themes of death and gore. Other bands to have emerged here include Morbid Angel, Obituary, and Autopsy. Around the same time as death metal (earlier in fact\u2026Venom\u2019s Welcome to Hell released in \u201881), we see many European bands (Venom, Bathory, Celtic Frost, etc.) playing \u201cblack metal,\u201d an atmospheric, emotional-tinged brand of minimally produced, Satan obsessed metal that was simultaneously light-years away from earlier metal groups, but metal nonetheless. All of these twists and turns have themselves led to even further divergences in sound, creating dozens of sub-genres in today\u2019s heavy metal scene. I could go on and on, but I\u2019m here to answer a question, not bore you with a history lesson! But suffice it to say, we now have categories like: Grindcore, metalcore, nu-metal, math-metal, war metal, blackened-death metal, technical metal, technical-death metal, doom metal, death-doom metal, progressive metal, djent, groove metal, viking metal, art metal, alternative metal, and slam-metal. And these are just to name a few! As bands continue to push the boundaries of exactly what metal is, we see them pull influences from any combination of existing sub-genres, and by introducing their own unique elements, they continue to forge hitherto unexplored, new categories. It\u2019s all very exciting, and I don\u2019t see this kind of continued evolution occurring in any other genre at the moment. It\u2019s in large part for this reason that I think metal is the most interesting genre of music that exists today. The music may be extreme, but again, it\u2019s very often technically super-impressive, combining many elements into a complete, cohesive package of complexity that challenges the listener and demands their attention, while at the same time demanding utter precision from those playing the music. It\u2019s a match made in heaven\u2026or is that a match made in hell? Cheers! -Mike ",
