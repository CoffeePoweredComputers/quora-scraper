            "answer_text": "\u201cRoar\u201d has a big beat and like any hit song nowadays, 2\u20133 winning hooks. Unlike a lot of sung (not rapped) hits that you hear, it seems very singable-by-the-average-person. \u201cRoar\u201d fits into the canon of such Motivational Pop/Rock classics as Eye of the Tiger (Survivor), We Will Rock You, We Are the Champions, Lose Yourself, and many more. It doesn\u2019t take a Ph.D. in literature to identify the lyrical shoutouts from \u201cRoar\u201d to the grizzled lineage of sports arena and workout morale booster songs, let alone the songs that get people through the mundane and the quotidian. Since it\u2019s sung by a woman, there\u2019s also an intersection with feminist anthems of the past - 1972\u2019s I Am Woman comes to mind, and the oeuvres of Madonna, Janet Jackson, and many others.
