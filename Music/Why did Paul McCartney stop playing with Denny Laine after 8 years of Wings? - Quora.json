            "answer_text": "McCartney was getting older, and after some traumatic events in his life\u2014his arrest and Lennon\u2019s murder\u2014got bored with Wings and tired of the baggage/responsibility that comes with leading a band of 4\u20135 others. After waiting for Paul throughout 1980 to decide what he wanted to do\u2014 tour, release another album or activate Wings, Denny quit the band in frustration in April \u201881. I think the way to look at Paul and Denny\u2019s relationship is that of respected employer to respected employee. They knew each other from the \u201860s and when Paul was forming Wings, Denny seemed like a good addition. He was a capable player, established singer, could write a few songs. He was also pretty diplomatic, which was a key asset in Wings. Head Wing Throughout ALL of Wings\u2019 lineups and albums from \u201972 to their official end in \u201881, Paul, Linda and Denny were the only members to play on all of the albums. As the various and revolving line-ups in Wings came and went, Laine was a go-between from Paul/Linda to the rest of the band when they had issues or grumbled about anything from accommodations and Paul telling them what to play to their salary and not getting some of their songs on albums. Members of Wings felt they were underpaid throughout the lifespan of the band. Paul later admitted he didn\u2019t pay them enough. They were all underpaid and felt they were put on a meager retainer. Including Lane. Not getting songs on albums was also a consistent source of tension for the band and, indirectly led to the end of Paul and Denny\u2019s relationship. Touring/Financial Troubles Denny\u2019s biggest claim to fame is the song Mull of Kintyre which he co-wrote with Paul. It was Wings biggest hit in Britain and one of the biggest songs there-ever. Laine did get a handful of songs on Wings albums\u2014however, none achieved any success except \u201cMull\u201d\u2026the rest of the band contributed even fewer songs than Denny and these were not popular songs. McCartney wrote 95% of the songs and, who could argue with that, given it was his band and his track record? But this meant that, b/c they didn\u2019t write songs, the rest of the band only made money WHEN they toured. In \u201880, Paul got arrested and spent 10 days in a Japanese jail for pot possession. As a result, McCartney canceled the Wings \u201980 tour. This hurt Denny and the rest of the band. Laine, in particular, had been dealing with financial and personal problems\u2014his marriage was in trouble. And he needed cash. So, he was very upset with Paul and told him so. The rest of the band were bitterly disappointed, too. (Eventually, in \u201886, after Wings, Denny sold Paul his interest in the song \u201cMull\u201d for $100k. A big chunk of $$$, but probably much less than it was worth. Before Laine went bankrupt.) From Wings to solo Paul After his arrest in Jan., McCartney had a change of heart about touring and a change of heart about Wings. He made McCartney II by himself and never used any of Wings there. It was sometime during this period that he considered ending Wings for good. In the second half of \u201880, when Paul starts writing new songs, Laine is the only member of the band who appears on them. After Lennon\u2019s murder in Dec., Paul focuses on work with Ringo, Geo Martin, and Eric Stewart, too. Denny is still helping Paul with songs in early \u201981 and, in fact, also adds background vocals with Paul/Linda to Harrison\u2019s Lennon tribute All Those Years Ago. In late \u201880/early \u201881, Denny contributes to what became the \u201cTug of War\u201d sessions. In fact, Denny appears on 6 songs of that album. But his financial troubles, resentments about not getting paid enough, not touring, and not knowing what would happen in the future caused resentment toward Paul. And Denny announced he quit Wings in April \u201881. Paul made the end of the band official when he ended it in \u201882. ",
