            "answer_text": "It can\u2019t and it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s all about the bit of time it takes. Right now copyright infringement is enforced. Recently Lady Gaga\u2019s Monster snippet made waves, but got taken down and all the clips that were made along with it. So it\u2019s only a matter of time before any copyright owners submit a takedown request. Any speculation about 15 second licences TikTok and its parent company ByteDance might have are just that, speculations. So far, a lot of very popular short sounds have been either take down or region restricted, after a claim was filed, while the less popular will escape for some time because they might not be found by the right claimants. UPDATE: TikTok now, early 2020, changed a few things like region restricted tracks and vids can pe played in profiles, when previously they were muted/unlisted but searching for the track and all clips which use it will lead to a dead end. And If you use a VPN to a U.S. server you might be able to see some tiktok celebrities have more videos listed than if you\u2019re browsing from outside of U.S.. YouTube on the other hand is massively more popular and has a lot more content, so much so that it frustrated the copyright troll industry, be it actual owners, legal representation or pure trolls. To avoid a legal backlash, Google implemented automated \u201cfingerprinting\u201d sounds and vids, so that they can be reidentified and blocked on subsequent uploads without human input, instead of a person/troll having to submit a copyright claim and another person/youtube employee having to review and manually take it down. Given the amount of content, the latter, these days, would be impossible. A good test would be to post something new and popular, it will be uploaded, it will stay up for a short while but then it will be taken down when a copyright claim will be filed. Subsequent reuploads will be blocked after that. ",

            "answer_text": "This is more of a matter for lawyers and website professionals, but based on my limited knowledge, I'll try to shine a light on this. YouTube may allow some copyrighted music in non-artist videos, if the proper attribution (credit for the music, artist, and label) exist in the description or the actual credits. However, this depends on the licensing agreement with the label; even with that, some artists refuse to allow videos of their music to be posted. For example, only shortly after Prince died did any YouTube videos exist of his music, and that was very carefully controlled by the labels involved and the Prince estate. Before that time, every Prince video was taken down, and anyone who posted one was given a warning. (Those warnings were clearly defined: Just like the old game of baseball, three strikes and you're out, as in your channel was taken down) There's no Bob Dylan music from his original Columbia/CBS recordings, and the 1970s group Eagles (note: they never used the article \u201cthe\u201d in any of their artwork) still won't allow some of their studio recordings on YouTube. Anyone posting their music without permission gets hit with a takedown notice. Still, there are fan-created music videos with major label content, because YouTube charges advertisers for short ads before and after these videos, which then creates a revenue source for the website. A portion of that money is paid back to the labels. TikTok has a different licensing agreement with labels, mostly because their videos are so short. They either allow a song, or block it outright.
