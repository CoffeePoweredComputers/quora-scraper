            "answer_text": "It\u2019s only an artifact from the \u201ccommon practice\u201d era of Western classical music. Before there was tonality (roughly defined as having a V-I cadence) there was modality. Modes were used, so variants of major (Lydian and Mixolydian in addition to the Ionian major scale) and minor (Dorian and Phrygian in addition to the standard Aeolian natural minor) were in use as well. Once the leading tone was established as a requirement of a cadence, it showed up in minor as the Harmonic Minor (natural minor, but with a leading tone). The raised sixth degree in Melodic Minor showed up so that when the leading tone was approached from below the augmented second interval could be avoided. Of course in major the Mixolydian was out because of no leading tone, and the Lydian fell out of use because the approach to the 3rd scale degree was so much more pressing when it was approached from the natural 4th. The Lydian 4th still showed up when it led UP, but in the tonal system it was treated as a cadence to the V chord. Also, the flat 7th in major still showed up, but again, mostly to lead to the 6th degree when it was being treated as the 3rd degree of the IV chord. These alterations were called Musica Ficta (false music) because they denied the home key. Melodic minor is a form of musica ficta, too. Basically, modal was out, tonal was in. Musica Ficta enabled us to keep the melodic minor, and harmonic minor was to enable the leading tone. In modern times, we have all kinds of variants on major AND minor scales, and modality is back strong again. We just don\u2019t have cute names for the variants, past the Greek names for the modes.

            "answer_text": "Scales are varied to make different sound colorations. Music styles are very much associated with signature sounds, and therefore, have signature scales associated with them. There are actually scale variations played over major harmonies all the time, especially in pop music. The most ubiquitous example would be the blues scale, which is based on minor pentatonic, which is superimposed over both major and minor chords regularly in blues, rock and country music. As for the traditional method of teaching 3 versions of minor, first of all, the Aeolian mode, or natural minor, makes sense to teach, since it is the naturally occurring version of minor, that the other versions are based on. Harmonic minor makes a lot of sense to be taught to classical students, since that is the go-to minor sound in art music for several centuries now. \u201cThey\u201d decided to sharp the natural seventh of the Aeolian mode, simply because it sounds cool. It gives you a stronger pull to tonic, by creating a leading tone. I honestly don\u2019t really know why classical students are taught melodic minor, I can\u2019t remember hearing it pretty much at all in my classical theory and history studies back in music school, but that was a while ago, I could be wrong. In jazz however, which I studied more in depth, melodic minor is commonly used, it\u2019s a very slick sounding minor scale. Jazz also uses the Dorian mode extensively, far more than Aeolian, and there can be a little harmonic minor thrown in, especially if they\u2019re going for a classical or Spanish sound. ",
