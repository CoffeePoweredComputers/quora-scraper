            "answer_text": "As a person who listens to both GOT7 and BTS songs on a daily basis, I can't seem to find much reasons. It's true that BTS writes about a variety of things that most people go through in life, making them naturally noticeable. But Got7 try hard too. They aren't given much chances to prove their worth and also, they're still learning. They need all the support and love they can get.JYP needs to take effort on his group GOT7 and learn to promote them. All the seven boys are so talented that it pains me to see their potentials being hidden away. They can dance, sing and rap so very well. And let's not forget, their extra talents. (Fencing, bboying,etc)I hate comparisons with different bands, because it always disgruntles me. I can't choose between GOT7 or BTS. Because they're both important to me, maybe GOT7 a teeny tiny bit more.Got7 sadly lacks Korean fans and I think I read somewhere that even the members felt a little sad about not having more of Korean fans. They should really promote their albums and their band more. (JYP I'm looking at you)BTS has been very wise in promoting with a United front, as many other here have said so. And it's true. It put them where they are now. The GOT7 members promote individually and I think it's not agreeable to many people. Even I'd like to see them do events together, rather than Jackson being away from Korea and with the others all scattered.Other than 'Just Right' they've got so many songs that are absolutely catchy. To name a few, fly, look, You Are, Never Ever, Tik Tik tok, two, \u2026. It goes on. Sure, ever kpop band has those few songs which don't become a hit. I'm sure even BTS has a few of those songs.Even I know that BTS have their own league, but don't push aside GOT7. Got7 has so much to give and show. They love their fan base a lot, and while so many rumors do spread, us aghases always get to the bottom of it. They come on vlive and they have a lot of humility (Which even BTS have). And they are all so normal and so close with each other, you can't help but like them. It will take some time for GOT7 to become popular as BTS, but I can see that day coming very soon. Again, I'm not exactly fond of comparing my two favorite kpop groups, because not only are they good friends, but they are also good singers, dancers and good people. I really love GOT7. And I'm proud to be their fan, no matter what happens. I'm also proud of being an ARMY. I just hope JYP realises the treasure he has within his grasp, and help them shine. Don't know if it answered your question but this is my opinion. ",

            "answer_text": "Jyp (got7\u2032s agency) have bad marketing strategies for the boysHE ALWAYS choose bad title track for the boys (just right and if you do excluded) while the rest of the album is good, and as it goes no one bothers listening to the rest of the songs in the albums except fans.Bighit ( Bts agency) BARELY have other active group it's promoting, the company pours their all into every BTS comeback, into every sound they make. Take DNA for example, the dance was made by their choreographer for 10 sleepless days.They are not know in South Korea as BTS is. And most of the times votes from South Korea fans does a lot in promoting the group.Got7 has had some conspiracy especially towards the black culture, BAMBAM said the N word in 2016. No one cared if he even knew the meaning or not, every one bashed him. JACKSON had on dreads, he apologized, but he did it again but for a Pepsi commercial, and he was bashed. He is human and it's only a little he could take so he defended himself which annoyed \u201cblack\u201d fans(And non black ones). There are some other things that happened that only true fans made the attempts to look into and findout they are not true, but when they try to defend the boys, people IGNORE, as the public will only believe what they want to.People believe the boys changing their style to \u201cedgy and hardcore\u201d. How do we know if they are changing or they\u2019've always been edgy? when in the past they didn't produce their own song because JYP asked them to wait till they can produce good songs? But now that they\u2019re producingtheir own style of songs, they\u2019re changing? They are trying too hard?Got7 just have a lot of hatred surrounding them, and a wide spread stereotype as a \u201cproblematic\u201d group, that's what my babies are called\u263aBut through it all, they have true fans allover the world, that are willing to stay and support.",
