            "answer_text": "The biggest reason is you are singing into a microphone, and you can actually hear what your voice sounds like to other people. Your voice sounds completely different to other people, than it does in your head. It's a hard fact you have to learn to live with if you want to eventually sound good. You might sound like a rock star in your mind, but the microphone shatters all illusions. It's kind of like walking around your whole life thinking you are the most beautiful person in the world, just to come across a mirror for the first time and realizing you are actually really ugly. It's a stage everyone who has ever gotten good at anything musical or artistic has to go through. When you are good enough to realize how horrible you actually are. It actually takes a while to even get to that point. You waltz around thinking you are the next big thing, until you actually hear yourself on a recording device or microphone and realize you've sounded horrible this whole time, and begin to realize everyone has been basically lying to you about how good you are out of politeness. A total shock to the ego\u2026 Something that causes a lot of people to give up, because of how painful it is. This stage is neccesary however because ego is not your friend, and this is a hard fact you must learn if you ever want to be a truly great artist. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, this is not true for everyone but, from my experience, the reason is two-fold. One, as happened in my chorus classes several times over the years, some people find it easier to sing along with another voice where others either only need an instrumental accompaniment while still others \u201chave the music in them\u201d and can sing a cappella, (which is not \u201csinging without music\u201d as singing is vocal music, but to sing with no instrumental music accompaniment). Two, with all these intact, singing karaoke requires a bit of nerves. It seems, ironically, that the medium was invented to expose the \u201cnot so gifted musically\u201d for the entertainment of others and themselves. Just my point of view! ",
