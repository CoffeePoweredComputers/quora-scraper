            "answer_text": "Probably the biggest orchestra ever called for is by the little known English composer Havergal Brian ( 1876\u20131972 ) , who has been attracting greater notice posthumously then in life . He was a largely self taught composer who came from a very poor family in England and labored in obscurity through most of his long life . The symphony , which is a setting of the medieval Christian hymn Te Deum Laudamus (we praise thee, oh God ), opens with a purely orchestral section and then proceeds to the Te Deum , and the whole thing lasts nearly two hours . Because of its extreme length , difficulty and the massive forces required , it has had only about 7 performances since being written nearly a century ago . The only studio recording was made some years ago in of all places, Bratislava, Slovakia , and is on the Naxos label . The most recent was in 2011 in London by the BBC symphony orchestra and various London choirs ; this has also been issued on CD . The work calls for four SATB choirs , a children's chorus , soprano, alto , tenor and baritone soloists . The orchestra is gargantuan , including four offstage brass brands ! The orchestra , including the offstage musicians, calls for 6 flutes, including 2 piccolos and an alto flute , 6 oboes , including 2 English horns , an oboe D\u2019Amore and a bass oboe . 4 B flat clarinets , 2 basset horns( a kind of clarinet ) , 2 bass clarinets and a contrabass one, 4 bassoons, 2 contrabassoons, 16 horns (8 offstage) , 12 trumpets (8 offstage , bass trumpet ,11 trombones including 8 offstage , one bass trombone and a contrabass trombone, 2 euphoniums, 2 tubas. The percussion includes : 6 sets of tympani , 1 glockenspiel, 1 xylophone, 2 bass drums, 6 sets of cymbals, 1 thunder machine, 1 long drum , 2 tambourines, 1 Tam Tam, 1 set of chimes, 1 set of chains, 2 triangles, one bird scarer ! , 1 set of tubular bells , one organ, one celesta . The strings : 20 first violins, 20 second violins, 16 violas, 14 cellos, 12 basses . WOW !!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Well, works that come to mind are the gigantic orchestra needed for AN ALPINE SYMPHONY by R. STRAUSS, requiring 130+ players, likewise SYMPHONY No.7 by SHOSTAKOVICH (min. 120 players) and LIGETI and his REQUIEM, which can require an impossibly huge orchestra, owing to Maestro Ligeti's use of micropolyphony, which subdivides the orchestra into smaller sections ad infinitum, creating a \u2018wall of sound\u2019 effect that's positively hypnotic\u2026 ",
