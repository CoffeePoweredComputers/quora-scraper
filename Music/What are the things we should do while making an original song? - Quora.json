            "answer_text": "I have a suggestion which rings very true for me. What ever you are writing, write the lyrics and notes for your to remember the tune and melody. This is from the voice of experience. From years ago, I wrote many songs and jazz tunes. My memory was excellent and I could remember songs I had written years ago\u2026 I had all the songs at my finger tips at a moments notice. In late 2008, I began having difficulty in remembering the tunes, and by December 2008 I had forgotten all of them. I even lost my ability to play guitar which I learned to play well in 1962 as a kid. I was diagnosed with a 7 inch diameter brain tumor which took 3 surgeries to remove and halt any further paralysis. Like an idiot, I never wrote any thing down\u2026 I thought I knew it all\u2026. obviously I didn\u2019t! When you write a tune, keep a notebook and if able record it on some type of recording device\u2026 Voice of experience. ",
