            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not 100% sure this is correct today, but when I was at Spotify we did some code to handle the situation where we would not have the license for a specific song on a specific album, but did have a license for the same song on a differently album (like a compilation, best-of or soundtrack), in those cases we would substitute the song we had license for. However, in that case, I do think that the song would be greyed out. It could be possible that you have it in your local files as well, but I don\u2019t think that is as likely. ",

            "answer_text": "Spotify has some rule and regulation. some songs has no licence for spotify to play ( greyed out) in other country. If you change the country of your spotify By going in spotify account then this will solve your problem and at the same time when you log into your account , a term and condition message\u2019ll appear on screen which says that Spotify is removing some privacy and licence in your country. I would suggest you to select USA because there is no problem related to licence. Log Out spotifyDownload VPN which has USA proxy ( Touch VPN is very good google extension software which provides USA Proxy.Select USA server and connectLog in spotifyGo to account setting and Select USA Country.Save and enjoy.Hint: Without Vpn you only see your country option.
