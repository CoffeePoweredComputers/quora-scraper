            "answer_text": "Buying a Miele product is like buying a promise. A promise well kept. Once a Miele, always a Miele: Miele customers around the world remain loyal to Miele and recommend Miele to others. This is so because Miele promises to manufacture the highest-quality domestic appliances and commercial equipment in the world. And this really drives them ahead. Mostly all single part in a Miele appliance is made at the Miele factory in Germany where they test them to last for 20 years. Most other manufactures will source parts from all over the world, mainly to try and keep the price down. And that\u2019s no bad thing. But because Miele make everything themselves \u2013 they make sure the quality is as good as it can be. The bearings in a Miele washing machine come with a 10 year guarantee! If you really look at it, it's not expesive in the long run. You buy a Miele once, you wouldn't prefer anything else ",

            "answer_text": "I would argue it isn\u2019t that expensive. I paid roughly 500 for my Miele canister vacuum back in 2000 and it has needed 100 in repairs since (just this last month) - so for an initial 500 investment (and it is an investment) i got flawless performance for 17 years and now have a new motor for another hopefully 15\u201320 years (that\u2019s about how long they are expected to perform). That is a lot less than numerous friends of mine who have gone through up to four to ten vacuums in the time i\u2019ve enjoyed my Miele. ",
