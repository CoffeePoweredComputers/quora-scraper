            "answer_text": "Park Jimin is an incredibly talented and hardworking individual. His voice has a tone unlike any others, in other words, his voice is very unique, it's piercing and sharp, if you would compare it to an object I would say his voice is something like a dagger. It's very captivating and pleasant to listen to it, and it has a wide emotional range as he is very good at transmitting feelings both with his voice and body. Which leads us to his dancing, Jimin is a classically trained dancer with roots in popping and street styles, meaning he is incredibly versatile, and as mentioned before, he is exceptional at portraying emotions, so Jimin is able to narrate a story with his body. Also, he is a very particular dancer, though he has not been fully immersed in contemporary since his school days, Jimin's body has not forgotten the poise or flexibility of one, his movements are incredibly elegant and smooth, that lead to him always being fluid through choreographies, he's always moving between moves even if it's almost imperceptible to the eye, always in continues motion that adds a different character to the routines. Jimin also excels at body isolations, he controls each part of his body with such precision it's unreal at times, which makes his movements even more detailed than that of other dancers. He always tends to modify choreographies too, there are movements that are different from the rest of the members', for example at the start of fire when they bend at the waist in almost a 90\u00b0 degree angle, Jimin also bends his right knee in almost slow-motion making the move flow into the next one without any awkwardness. He is also an anatomical wonder, Jimin though slight is very muscular, and having high muscle mass leads generally to rigidity so the fact that he is so flexible is an honest surprise, for him to be muscular and also that flexible he would have had to break down his muscles into smaller muscles to allow him more range and precise control of movement, which leads also to how when Jimin moves his arm it's not just his arm that moves but if hou watch closely you can see the muscles in his back shifting as well (wonderful to be hones). He is the mix between a ballerina and a ballerino, he has the chest, waist, and graceful neck of a ballerina, but the legs, arms, and back of a ballerino; and contrary to how ballerina/os move their neck and then their body follows, Jimin moves his body and then his neck follows, adding a different tone to his movements. Jimin is also known for having incredibly beautiful lines, no matter when you take a photograph of him during a performance, he will always look like he is posing even if he is just in the middle of executing a difficult dance move. In summary, he is powerful, detailed, elegant, smooth, and emotional. Personality-wise, Jimin is incredibly mature, he is intelligent, charismatic, and a very kind person. He is also highly professional and an extreme hard-worker on top of being a perfectionist, which leads to him always pushing himself to be better. Jimin is also humble and grateful to people who have supported him, he is honest and values friendship and family a lot. He is also has a a sort of naughty sense of humor, and his laugh and smile are simply two of the most beautiful things the universe has ever seen. Jimin is lovable, it's very hard to actively dislike him if you are unbiased towards him. He is admired by many people, included other idols, artists, and people from the entertainment world in general. Now, two of Park Jimin's most noticeable traits: his charisma and stage presence. There's a running joke between ARMY and k-netz, \u201cThe Jimin Effect\u201d, no matter the gender or sexual orientation of the person, Park Jimin makes them fall in love with him, as he is incredibly charming both on and off stage, people who meet him are instantly charmed by the 23 year old, and those who only know him through screens are either instantly charmed or slowly won over by his good-looks, talents, ans great personality, and as they say: \u201conce you Jim-In you can't Jim-Out\u201d. Now, his stage presence, there is a video somewhere that shows Jimin's duality perfectly: you can tell the moment his personality changes into off-stage mode. When Jimin goes into performance mode, he grows incredibly intense and sometimes it even comes across as intimidating as told by many people who have met him or seen him live, the moment he sets foot on the stage, you can tell. The first times I truly noticed it was during Blood Sweat and Tears and Lie, Jimin simply seemed to suck the oxygen out of the air and made it excruciatingly hard to breathe, and it was impossible for me to take my eyes off of him even for once second, he just commanded full attention at all times. His charisma is uncanny. Oh, and Park Jimin is incredibly beautiful to boot. I think all of those things are what make him so popular. It's so hard not to be drawn in by him. ",

            "answer_text": "All K-pop stars are popular in their own ways but to answer the question directly, I will state some factors that could be an answer as to why Park Jimin is so popular nowadays: (02/19/19) Park Jimin is currently the number 1 of the Brand Reputation Rankings for individual boy group members as revealed by the Korean Business Research Institute.
