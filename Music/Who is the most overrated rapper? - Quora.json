            "answer_text": "Jay-Z  This one may piss off a lot of hip-hop heads, but so be it. Recently, a lot of rappers and celebrity rap fans have been releasing their top 50 rapper lists. And do you know what a lot of them have in common? Look at all these lists and tell me. Zoom in if you have to.  This one\u2019s by radio personality Ebro Darden[1]  This list is by RapGenius CCO Brendan Frederick. [2]  And this list was compiled by rapper Troy Ave. [3] You know what all three of these lists have in common? I can think of two things. All three lists are made by respected and influential figures in the hip-hop game.All three lists feature Jay-Z at either first or second. The only time he\u2019s not ranked first is when he loses out to Tupac, technically making him widely considered to be the best rapper alive.It all reminds me of this one line Jay-Z (referred to here as Hov) said on a song with Kanye West. Hov\u2019s a living legend and I\u2019ll tell you why Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov\u2019s still alive[4] And what I\u2019m wondering here is why Jay-Z\u2019s reached GOAT status in the minds of most hip-hop heads. What has he done to earn the title of \u2018Best Rapper Alive\u2019, especially while Nas, Rakim, Royce da 5\u20329\u2033 and Andre 3000 still continue to walk this earth? I\u2019m sorry, but I say Jay-Z isn\u2019t fit to hold Nas\u2019s cock as far as rappers go. Nas is hardly the only rapper I consider to be more deserving of the GOAT title than Jay-Z, but let\u2019s stack him up against Jay-Z in several of the categories that form the criteria for Best Rapper. [5]  Storytelling This category goes to Nas by a long shot. In fact, Nas is such a good storyteller that XXL Magazine literally wrote an article of *20 *of Nas\u2019 best feats of storytelling in rap. The following quote is taken directly from that article Esco (Nas) has acquired the glow, collected all the Infinity Stones and lived in a Super Saiyan state of being for more than two decades. The Queens legend\u2019s innate ability to whimsically string words together is punctuated by his penchant for delivering some of the most vividly picturesque tracks in rap history.[6] We\u2019re talking about the man who dropped the greatest solo album in rap history. The emcee who has masterpiece narratives like One Love, I Gave You Power, I Can, 2nd Childhood and Sekou Story under his belt. What does Jay-Z have that can compare to that? 99 Problems? Momma Loves Me? Meet The Parents? Nah. Not only is he outclassed here by Nas, but also Slick Rick, Scarface, Warren G and even Biz Markie. Flow This is possibly Jay-Z\u2019s weakest area, and it shows, especially in comparison to Nas. Here\u2019s a rhyme scheme analysis from NY State of Mind, widely considered to be one of Nas\u2019s best songs.  Meanwhile, here\u2019s a similar analysis of Jay-Z\u2019s first verse on Renegade, also considered to be one of his very best.  If the visualisation of this flow doesn\u2019t illustrate it for you, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. There\u2019s this beautiful symmetry in rhyme schemes that\u2019s required for a rapper to have good flow, and Jay-Z oftentimes doesn\u2019t have it. His cadences are very often simplistic. Nothing on Nas, Big L, Eminem or even Crooked I. Rap Beefs This is one category I can directly put Jay-Z and Nas head-to-head in. Throughout the early 2000s, the two rappers were locked in a giant feud that, while personal and ugly, gave us two incredible diss tracks, entitled Takeover and Ether respectively. Who had the better diss track, you ask? Well, people commonly use the slang term \u2018ethered\u2019 in daily life to describe someone who\u2019s been obliterated and fucked up beyond recognition in some form of competition.  As great as Takeover may have been, it wasn\u2019t the best. Nas won that beef by a long shot. And if you can\u2019t win a rap beef, how can you be considered the best? Sales and Longevity Here\u2019s a category where I will admit Jay-Z reigns supreme. Hova\u2019s one of the bestselling artists of the 21st century. Any single he releases cracks the Hot 100. He\u2019s almost guaranteed platinum if he releases an album. Nas doesn\u2019t have that kind of commercial success. And longevity? Yes, he wins there. Though his albums may not be the definitive best, (projects like Enter the 36, Illmatic and Midnight Marauders win there) they certainly stand the test of time much better than, say, LL Cool J. And as far as longevity? He\u2019s been in the game since 1995, and he\u2019s been consistently relevant and famous during this time. But the likes of MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice prove that sales aren\u2019t everything in hip-hop. Nor is longevity. Biggie was only active for five years, Pac was only active for six and Big L for seven. It\u2019s not about how long you last, it\u2019s about what you make of it. Impact On The Culture Yet again, Jay-Z is the absolute undisputed king here. He\u2019s completely revolutionised the game in a way that\u2019s never been seen before, and I\u2019m far from the only person to think that. [7] He gave the world Kanye West, became hip-hop\u2019s first billionaire, fought for artists\u2019 rights to their own intellectual property, influenced countless rappers in the game and just generally built a dynasty that\u2019ll never be forgotten. But so many of these achievements simply weren\u2019t made when Jay-Z was on the mic. Yeah, yeah, he was influential. But you know who else has been influential in the hip-hop game? Rick Rubin. Dr Dre. Puffy. And yet you\u2019ll never see them on any reputable Top Rappers list. In my opinion, being the best rapper isn\u2019t about what you do when you\u2019re not rapping, no matter how influential it is. Nah, being the best rapper is simply about one thing: rapping the best.  Look, there\u2019s no doubt that Jay-Z has been revolutionary to not only hip-hop, but even the world. Nor am I disputing that he\u2019s an incredibly talented rapper, and that he\u2019s cemented his spot in hip-hop\u2019s top 20 or 25 of all time. I just feel as though his skills as a lyricist are often overrated simply because of the impact he\u2019s had on the game. Jay-Z\u2019s a great rapper, I was never disputing that. He\u2019s just not the best. Footnotes[1] Ebro Darden on Instagram: \u201c#TheRealTop50 ....

            "answer_text": "Juice Wrld.  Now, hey, before you get all tiger on me, (especially you Zack), just listen. The thing that aggravates me the most is not Juice himself but his fans. Most of his fans only discovered him after he died. And, now all of the sudden, he has all these fans. Just because he died? I do like his music. But I\u2019m not the type to go listen to someone just because they get fame after they\u2019re dead. The overrated aspect mostly comes from the fans that just listen to him because they think it\u2019s cool and because they heard he died so now they go listen to him. Here are his stats on spotify:  As you can see, Lucid Dreams is an extremely overrated song. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen it on those fake depressed 13 year old snapchat stories with the caption, \u201cI will never love again.\u201d Boy, you\u2019re literally 13, the only thing you\u2019ve ever loved is your momma.  It annoys me. Rip. xoxo,abi good ",
