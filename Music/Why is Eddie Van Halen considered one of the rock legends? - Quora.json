            "answer_text": " Why wouldn\u2019t he be? Literally, every guitarist who came after \u201980s were copying him. Well, he might not be the only best guitarist or most talented out there. But he was the most mainstream guitarist of \u201880s. He was the next Hendrix. He extended what Hendrix had started. Although there is an overlooked guitarist. Its Ritchie Blackmore.[1] EVH, was a big booster to rock guitar. A big part of guitar shredding came through him. Even Randy Rhoads was inspired by him.[2] Besides, EVH was also a very good keyboardist. As far as I know he even won the piano competition in his school. So, I don\u2019t see any reason for not being EVH a legend. Although one of the worst things of him was getting involved in glam rock/metal. Which was very annoying. Nevertheless it wouldn\u2019t make him a bad guitarist. Footnotes[1] Ritchie Blackmore: The Link Between Hendrix and Van Halen[2] Eddie Van Halen & Randy Rhoads: Duelling Guitarists",
