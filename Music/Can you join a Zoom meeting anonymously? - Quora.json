Also as for the doubt with the \u201chow to have a meeting with a contact on zoom?\u201d The answer for the question is similar to the question asked previously and also you cannot enter into the meeting without any contact link. The contacts are needed to be verified by the host gathering you for the meeting and also that you need to have the registration link through which you can make the meeting entry. There are a lot more features which are available in the zoom launcher for the free users and also for the premium users. You need to pay a certain level of amount to enjoy the premium usage. ",

Unless you\u2019re a hacker, you can\u2019t really crash into someone else\u2019s meeting. Your chosen name pops up as you plug in. If you feel comfortable being the uninvited guest, then try it. Be warned, shouts of abusive language will echo at you. And you\u2019ll quickly be ejected. ",

            "answer_text": "This is not possible as Zoom does not have an option where you can enter meetings without the host knowing it. However, an alternate to this can be renaming yourself, so that the host does not know your real name. However, this again depends on the host\u2019s settings as the host has an option to not allow participants to rename themselves or perform any action. ",
