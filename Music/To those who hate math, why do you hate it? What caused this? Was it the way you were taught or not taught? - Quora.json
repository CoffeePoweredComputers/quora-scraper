            "answer_text": "Ahhhhh Math, the bane of my academic career. See, everything was fine until multiplication. Now I have a learning difference that exclusively applies to math. Math was the only subject I studied for in school. Ever. Why? Well, it\u2019s because I can work with a tutor an hour a day five-six days a week and still fail a test. For example on the ACT I got a 36 in reading, a 35 in English and a 32 in science with little studying but only after three months of intensive work did I manage to rase my math score of 19 to a twenty-four. The problem is rooted in my test anxiety alongside my difference. My third grade teacher - who shall remain unnamed - was close to retirement and terrorized the class, especially those students she deemed \u2018bad\u2019 at something. I was terrified of her because she would assign us a multiplication/division table one day and the very next we had a test on it. We would sit at our desks with cardboard dividers and she would walk around the room, listing off multiplication and division tables for a specific number, lets say. . . seven. We would have a blank piece of paper on which we would write the response and we had five seconds to do so. Then, she moved on. She would never repeat a problem and if you got a single response out of twenty incorrect you failed. When you failed your name was put up on the board and the entire class was told that you were bad and you didn\u2019t study. Then, you would take the test over and over again and each time you \u2018failed\u2019 the teacher announced it and your name would stubbornly stay up on that whiteboard, written in red pen. Glorious. Thus began my mental block towards math. When my mom met the teacher though, the woman raved, RAVED about me and my creative writing. This crazy teacher who never had a kind word for me and criticized my habit of reading in class told my mother that I was one of the most gifted creative writers she had ever had the privilege to have in her class. She said I wrote like someone at least several years older than I actually was and to this day her words keep me at my mission to become a published author. I mean, if she can compliment my creative writing. . . I must be pretty decent. Despite this, I still fear math and when I look at a math test my mind goes completely, utterly and overwhelmingly blank. ",

            "answer_text": "Where do I start\u2026. Not enough time in the context of all the subjects that you had to do at school/university. Maths is a complete and utter time sink that steals away all the time you have to study other subjects. Rather like playing the piano anyone can be a good mathematician IF YOU HAVE THE TIME AND PATIENCE to study it. But all too often the educational system makes too many other demands on students. Something has to give eventually. Math can indeed be great if you have the time to study it and nothing else.Lack of real life application areas. Maths for maths sake sucks unless you can appreciate the beauty of mathematical relationships (which only mathematicians do\u2026.) if you can get to this stage then great, but if you don\u2019t see the point in any of it or any real life application then it seems a waste of time and people don\u2019t engage.The arrogance of mathematicians that \u201canyone can do maths\u201d. what then about people who suffer from dyscalcia?An educational system that sanctions people that do badly in math. It is, in essence a punishment for being a slow learner. Resit marks are capped at a lower score. University and college admissions policies prejudice against students who take more than one attempt to get the required maths grades to get onto a science or engineering course.Constant negative feedback from maths teachers which just puts some people into a downward spiral of maths loathing and anxiety. Unlike arts and social sciences it\u2019s either right or it is wrong and there are no second prizes in mathematics..Maths tests and maths exams. My pet hate was learning all the rules, doing lots of practice and then when it came to the exam there were unexpected twists put into the questions that were never explicitly covered in the class material which threw me off and made me panic in the exam and ruined the whole question as I got stuck and couldn\u2019t get to the stages where I could apply the bits I DID know. Maths teachers of course argue these twists are put in so that: \u201cthis is to prove you didn\u2019t learn it by rote\u201d - which is fine when the exam clock isn\u2019t ticking and you haven\u2019t got the time to suss it out.I am sure that I can think of more, but I am falling behind now with my maths homework\u2026.
