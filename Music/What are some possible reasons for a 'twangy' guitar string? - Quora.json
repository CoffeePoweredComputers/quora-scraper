            "answer_text": "Guitars change over time. Possibly what is happening is that string is hitting a fret. Look across the neck, so your eye is looking more or less directly across the strings and hit your B string.Move your view up and down the neck and look for an anomaly in the vibration of that string. In general, when you pluck a string, it\u2019ll vibrate with one long wave anchored at the bridge and the nut. You\u2019ll see something like a picture of a jumprope freeze framed at the top and the bottom of the swing. If you lightly touch the middle of the string (12th fret) as you pluck it and then remove that finger, you\u2019ll get a pitch one octave up from the unfretted string and the same pitch as if you had completely fretted it but with a very different tone. This is known as a harmonic. What happens visually is that instead of one jumprope, you\u2019ll see two split where you touched the string and they\u2019ll be oscillating oppositely. What you\u2019re looking for is not a clean change like that, but some place where the simple jumprope wave is lightly hitting a fret. ",

            "answer_text": "If there is fret buzz, then perhaps the action is too low. An an acoustic guitar, you can increase the action by buying a new saddle and then using a sandpaper to ensure the guitar has correct action. A good action would be 3/32\" to 7/64\" on the bass E string at the 12th fret and 2/32\" to 5/64\" on the treble E. Of course, this is a very personal preference. For the electric, it depends on the guitar, but there are ways to increase the action (and usually the action of an electric guitar would be lower than that of an acoustic). It\u2019s usually a good idea to leave the nut alone. If the action at the nut is too high, take your guitar to a repair shop and have them do it for you. ",
