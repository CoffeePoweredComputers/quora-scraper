            "answer_text": "If you're interested, and he hasn't asked you out, then yes, the logical thing is to ask him to coffee or some other get-together. Worst case scenario, you get turned down (which sucks, but needn't be devastating). Best case scenario, he agrees and you have a lovely date.  Your other option is to try to flirt and see if he asks you out, but in my experience, a lot of great guys are crap at understanding flirtation. The more you try to be sneaky about it, the less likely they are to get your meaning. Just be direct. ",

            "answer_text": " If you are the nice guy, you often have trouble in making the first move when you get close to a girl. You become scared, having so many doubts in your mind when all you should be doing is getting all her attention on yourself. You often shy away from the moment when you should have stepped up your game and told the girl about your feelings. You should remember that rejection is not the worst thing in the world if it happens. There are a lot of people who got rejected on their first try, but they are happily in love with another person now. So make the first move on a girl without thinking much about it. How To Make The First Move On A Girl 1. Make A Romantic Set Up You have known the girl as a friend for some time but you want to take things a notch higher now. This is your chance to do things a little differently so that she notices what you are suggesting. Make things a little romantic when you decide to spend time with her.  2. Respond With Body Language You should follow her body language and understand if she likes being with you. Watch out for that smile when you both are going out for a walk together. You should know that she likes being with you. 3. Ask Her Out If everything has gone the way you planned till now without any hesitation from her side. This is your cue to ask her out soon. Let her know that you would like to take her out. Let her take her time before she responds. Avoid being pushy here or you might scare her away.
