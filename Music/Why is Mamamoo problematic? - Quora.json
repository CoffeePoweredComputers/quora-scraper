            "answer_text": "Mamamoo isn\u2019t problematic. Have they done offensive and hurtful things in the past? Yes. They were ignorant and uneducated at the time. But their fans always informed them about their insensitive actions and Mamamoo always immediately apologized. They never went into these situations with the intent of hurting or offending anyone. They continue to work on bettering themselves and educating themselves on cultures around the world so that there won\u2019t be a repeat of past mistakes. That\u2019s growth. And to me, that\u2019s the furthest thing from \u201cproblematic\u201d. The reason people still believe they are problematic is because some Kpop fans are just bandwagon haters and others simply just don\u2019t know Mamamoo. They only know of the incidents and not the actual people behind them. For those of you who are curious, Mamamoo is a group of four beautiful women who just love to make music and want to share that love with the world. They empower ALL women, support ALL love, and encourage self expression. So please take the time to get to know them before you judge them based off of half a story. Thank you and stan Mamamoo.  Edit: For those of you who are going to comment something along the lines of \u201cHoW CAn tHeY nOT kNoW wHAT BLACKFACE Is?\u201d please don\u2019t. Many people living outside the Western world or even some in it are not aware of blackface. It\u2019s also very common in S. Korea for Koreans to darken their skin to portray a darker Korean. It isn\u2019t seen as something racist or demeaning in their culture, so Mamamoo mistakenly did the same thing, but with non Koreans. I\u2019m not excusing their actions, I\u2019m just saying yes it is possible that people don\u2019t know about bf. ",

            "answer_text": "Mamamoo has done things which led to them being called problematic. Bruno Mars incident In March 2017, Mamamoo did a cover of Bruno Mars' Uptown Funk. They tried to look like Bruno Mars as much as possible and to do this, they darkened their face, aka blackface. They got a huge backlash and issued an apology.  Hwasa singing the n-word Hwasa, a member of the group, released a cover of Beyonce's Irreplaceable and sang the n-word in it. She also got a lot of backlash for this. However, from what I could find, she never issued an apology. Those are the most common reasons as to why Mamamoo are regarded as problematic. ",
