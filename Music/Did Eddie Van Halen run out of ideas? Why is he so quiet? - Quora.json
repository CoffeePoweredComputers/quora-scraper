            "answer_text": "It\u2019s hard to say if he\u2019s run out of ideas or not. He has consistently stated that he has a lot of ideas that he\u2019s holding onto until\u2026 well, that\u2019s the question, isn\u2019t it? Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t think he has any real, practical idea what to do with whatever he does. As I discussed in Neil Sarver's answer to Is Eddie van Halen's guitar work the main appeal of Van Halen?, Eddie Van Halen needs a frame to put around his playing.  At this point, the clear \u201cparty\u201d frame that David Lee Roth have him doesn\u2019t seem to interest in. I know the popular explanation for A Different Kind of Truth being mostly material was that the band couldn\u2019t put up with each other. I\u2019m not arguing that\u2019s not somewhat true, but I also think Eddie is no longer that interested in creating within that frame. I also don\u2019t think that he ever settled into a clear frame with Sammy Hagar or Gary Cherone to go back to, if he were interested. So, he\u2019s left with the question is what he would do, and I think he doesn\u2019t know what that would be at this point, and I don\u2019t think with all of the success he\u2019s already enjoyed he\u2019s personally driven to figure it out. I\u2019m not saying he couldn\u2019t stumble into something in the future, but I don\u2019t think he feels he has something to prove. He can do whatever music he does for his own purposes. He can proudly watch as Wolfgang Van Halen works on his solo album. I think he\u2019s mostly ok with that. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know Eddie personally but if I had to make an educated guess, it\u2019s not that Eddie has run out of ideas as much as he\u2019s run out of people he can work with. His personality clashes with lead singers is legendary and he and Alex have kind of become notoriously difficult to work with. Add to that Van Halen\u2019s main audience isn\u2019t interested in seeing them with yet another front man which means that Ed and Al mend fences with Sammy, tolerate Dave or try to push another singer into their fans (which again, there just doesn\u2019t seem to be a market for). The last album and tour with Dave was good but both Eddie and Dave admitted they really don\u2019t enjoy each other\u2019s company and don\u2019t really have much in common anymore. The last tour they did with Sammy had both parties taking separate planes, staying in different hotels, etc. The only time they saw each other was on stage. So I\u2019d count on not hearing much from Van Halen unless they need the money or want to promote something. ",

            "answer_text": "You really have to know a person intimately to be able to say why they may have ceased to present creative output. And this quietness could be anything from a creative wit dulled from years of partying to a welcome time in a rock star\u2019s life of not having to work on songs all the time, of not having to get ready for the next world tour, not having to argue with bandmates and stakeholders over every last note. It\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. Nor do we we know, whether Mr. van Halen might not be privately awash in a prolific deluge of ideas without precedent yet simply disinclined to share for whatever reason. That being said, it\u2019s equally possible that we\u2019ve heard the last good work from one of the 20th century\u2019s most astounding musical minds. ",

That along with the fact that he may have been born with fetal alcohol syndrome. The guy has no upper lip,, and that flat nose. A classic sign of FAS. ",
