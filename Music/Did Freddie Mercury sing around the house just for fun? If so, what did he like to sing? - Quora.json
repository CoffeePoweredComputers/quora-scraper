            "answer_text": "Freddie's mother clames in one of her rare interviews: 'Right from the start, Freddie was musical. He had it on his mind all the time'. One of his college mates Tony Cadignani remembers Freddie Bulsara as a lad 'tinkering around on the piano, always humming a tune and trying to write songs. It was in his blood'. Oneday Cadignani caught a glimpse of Freddie's passport. \"He'd listed his profession as \"musician\". I said, 'Why have you got that in there?' He said, 'Because I am going to get into music and become a musician.' Here are some extracts from the book written by Freddie's ex-girlfriend Rosemary Pearson: \"He was a shy, geeky Asian boy who was always singing to himself... She remembered how she had smiled after hearing him humming abstract tunes to himself, or bursting spontaneously into song in a far corner of that second-floor studio...\" \"So Rosemary had focused increasingly on her Asian lover, Saturday late afternoons being their most relaxed times together: Freddie and Rosemary were often to be found walking about in London in easy silence, or hanging out in various cafes talking about politics, art and, increasingly, music. 'But isn't Hendrix like Jackson Pollock?' mused Freddie once, starting to sing himself: 'All along the watchtower, the thief he gently spoke...' [after Hendrix]. 'Ah, the scientist of sound, no less! ...As for you, my darling, you are all fur coats and no knickers! Your so-called love for me is just a bloody sham! You won't even let me visit you in your flat!' Freddie had suddenly been furious. 'Your boyfriend who doesn't care about you - you're just there to keep his bed warm!' But then he pressed himself against her with an irresistible smile\" 'God, I'm so horny for you - let's make love NOW!' That rapid-fire change of mood and subject, punctuated by fragments of songs and suggestions of music was typical of him, as was a lasciviousness that always lay just beneath the surface... 'Come on - there's time to get to that Fox's Theatre Costumes shop in Soho, if we hurry,' - Rosemary had called out, but Freddie was already back with the music of Hendrix, humming away to himself again in a world of his own... They were getting really enthusiastic about the \"performance possibilities\" of those antique costumes; Freddie tried on the red bolero over his T-Shirt, but pulled it off again in disgust and became instantly morose, muttering that he still had nothing to wear at his next gig. Rosemary suggested some silver jeans, 'That'd really knock'em dead... I'd even sew you into them! she enthused, in an effort to keep up the good mood. 'You're such a sweety - when you're not being really horrid to me! Oh god, I must stop flogging myself to death.' Moments later, as though none of this had happened, he was singing again: 'Are your experienced...' 'Hendrix, you're the ultimate rock god! Electric Ladyland sounds like a three hundred piece guitar orchestra...just hearing it in my head makes me feel like a pagoda gyrating in the sky!' And in a instant he was off down the street moving like a whirling Dervish... Half an hour later and starting to get tired, they stumbled into a Carribian cafe, off Ladbroke Grove. It must have been the first time they'd sat down for hours; Freddie was now once more in a quiet and reflective mood. 'I just want to be in love and in lust at the same time!' he announced blandly, his unrequited libido set in motion again. 'Thanks a lot,' Rosemary had retorted; 'and you wonder why we are just 'part-time' lovers?' She had been really annoyed. 'You're the only one who really knows me,' he remonstrated,'and anyway, you're gorgeous, and I do love you, but...' hesitating, he added, 'what the hell do I want?' followed by an even longer pause: 'I want to...be...Hendrix.' Freddie gazed into the middle distance, and almost inaudibly started to sing again \"...'scuse me, while I kiss this guy' [after Hendrix] he repeated again and again, with a smile emerging as his gaze returned to Rosemary's. 'Isn't it \"kiss the sky\"?' she had interrupted, grinning at him. 'It's what I want it to be: KISS THIS GUY...he's such a genius! Oh god, I'm seeing him again tonight in Camden Town... are you coming?\" So, as we can see, Freddie was singing or humming tunes all the time and everywhere. Singing really was in his blood. Music was flowing through his veins towards his heart. Here is a record made by Freddie's PA Peter Freestone of Freddie singing at his home (Garden Lodge) with his friends Mike Moran (at the piano) and Peter Straker. And another record of Freddie singing in the bathroom. I bet walls of Garden Lodge must be missing so much the music which filled the house while Freddie lived there.   ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m sure that he did because he did love to sing and did it for fun. What did he sing? I\u2019m sure the answer is everything with his love for all genres. His parents would have him sing for company when he was just a toddler. They even took him with them to visit friends sometimes so he could sing for them while there. He joined and loved singing in the choir at boarding school but was too shy to do solos. Choir was not enough though so he and his friends formed a band in junior high band called \u201cThe Hectics\u201d. Again, Freddie was too shy to be the lead singer but instead harmonized and played \u201cboogie woogie\u201d piano. I imagine the time spent practicing was almost as enjoyable as the performing. At college he would gather with other guys at a piano in the cafeteria and sing harmonies. They would even sing in the bathroom on occasion because of the acoustics. One of the guys that he sang with on campus and became good friends with was Tim Staffel who was the lead singer for Smile. Tim later introduced Freddie to his band which also consisted of Brian and Roger. As an adult after Freddie was already a star when friends came over they would often be pressed to gather around his piano and sing. Imagine getting to sing with Freddie Mercury. There are recordings of them singing around his piano at Garden Lodge. He would often ad-lib then and in the studio to make the others laugh. That\u2019s where the line \u201cGimme, gimme, gimme, fried chicken!\u201d in One Vision came from. He also loved singing Christmas carols. He wrote one of Queen\u2019s biggest hits \u201cCrazy Little Thing Called Love\u201d while in the bathtub. So yes he \u201csang in the shower\u201d only he didn\u2019t like to shower because taking a hot bath was such a luxury after years of boarding school in which they could only take cold showers most of the time. He loved using and experimenting with his voice in a free style which is why we got the \u201cay-ohs\u201d and the spine-tingling improvisations during their concerts. He was a vocal gymnast and it\u2019s not surprising that his solo album \u201cMr. Bad Guy\u201d gave us \u201cLiving On My Own\u201d with all that scatting. He was serious about his singing but seemed to never lose the pure joy of it.  ",
