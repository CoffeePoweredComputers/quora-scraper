            "answer_text": "Start with the free software, Garageband. Invest in a midi controller (~$40 for a low-end 25 key). That's all you need. Fiddle around with the digital instruments until you find some that soothe your moods. If you want to add vocals, purchase a USB mic. Yeti makes a fantastic one.  If any of these tools become of interest, you can upgrade to a more professional version. Logic Pro X is essentially Garageband on steroids and HGH (and at only $200, it's a steal). Midi controllers come in dozens of sizes and qualities. And of course there's a whole world of microphones. There's really no need to spend much money to begin music production. It's a misconception that a quality song requires expensive equipment; experienced producers can use a verse recorded from a phone in a bedroom.   Note: I'm assuming you're using a Mac for this. PC offers similar software. Some songs do require the crisp and raw vocals that only a quality microphone can offer, but there's always a way around this. I recommend messing with the filters in Logic. I'm also assuming you're not recording any analog instruments (guitar, bass guitar, acoustic drums, etc.) as those tend to make recording infinitely more complicated. ",

            "answer_text": "Use a DAW! (Google it!) If you have a Mac, test the free stuff (still really good) like GarageBand before upgrading to Logic Pro X. If you\u2019re on a pc, there\u2019s a lot to choose in between, it\u2019s actually irrelevant what kind of DAW you choose, since it ultimately comes down to how much interest and time you want to put in. ALL DAWs requires learning. There\u2019s Ableton (lite and full versions..) FL studio (every EDM artist\u2019s alternative to logic..) Cubase (don\u2019t know much about it) And plenty of other.. However, if you don\u2019t know anything about creating music on your computer, I think you should go with a free version of any program, so you don\u2019t get confused with all the features the paid programmes have. Good luck! ",
