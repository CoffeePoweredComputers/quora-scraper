            "answer_text": "Uh, I think there were a few. Blackpink got NOTHING. I was told it was because since they couldn\u2019t attend they get zero awards (dumb in my opinion). They are in Japan doing a string of concerts. So naturally unable to attend. But they were nominated quite a lot. Two categories I felt pretty strongly about where the award ended up going. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I get it. K-Pop Idols work their butts off. Each and every one of them give their all and they all 100% deserve recognition for efforts. However, I was displeased with Best New Male Artist: Winner: TXT. Who I believe SHOULD have won: Ateez. I ADORE TXT but I think that Ateez just has that something MORE that TXT is still missing. It\u2019s hard to explain. And Best Dance Performance - Male Group: Winner: BTS. Who I believe SHOULD have won: Literally any other group nominated in that category (Got7 \u201cEclipse\u201d, EXO \u201cTempo\u201d, NU\u2019EST \u201cBet Bet\u201d, Monsta X \u201cAlligator\u201d, and Seventeen \u201cFear\u201d). Boy with Luv was 100% a bop but it did not have great choreo. ",
