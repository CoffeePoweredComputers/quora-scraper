            "answer_text": "The Rain song.! It is probably one of the greatest songs played on the acoustic. Jimmy page is absolutely fantastic in this song. If you truly love guitar and consider it as the main controlling instrument of a song (like they did back in the 70\u2019s), you should definitely check out this song. The lyrics are also very sweet and touching. Robert Plant's lyrics deal with the changing emotions of love. Here are some interesting facts about this song. This was written after the legendary George Harrison (The Beatles\u2019 guitarist) who is a huge fan, told John Bonham (Zeppelin's drummer) that the trouble with Led Zeppelin is that they don't do any ballads. Bonham brought in the idea, and the rest of the band worked with him to put it together. It is was one of the few Zeppelin songs where all four members shared the composer credit.In a nod to George Harrison, Jimmy Page played the first two notes of the Harrison-written Beatles song \"Something\" in the intro to \"The Rain Song.\"In an interview with Rolling Stone, Plant said this was his best Led Zeppelin vocal performance.Drummer John Bonham took brushes to his drums on this song, demonstrating his versatility. Surprisingly, he continued to use them even when the song gets heavy.Robert Plant's lyrics deal with the changing emotions of love.The tuning of the guitar is really ridiculous. It is miles away from the standard tuning (EBGDAE). Page really knows his stuff XD ..!The Rain Song - Jimmy Page & Robert Plant HD [No Quarter 1994] It is really hard to top this song. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cGallows Pole\u201d from Led Zeppelin III. Few people realize that this is a Child Ballad (#95), meaning it was a folk song passed down over the centuries through the oral tradition with many variations from many countries before being collected by Francis James Child in the 19th century. In most versions, this dialogue song is known as \u201cThe Maid Freed From the Gallows\u201d and has a happy ending: after unsuccessfully begging successive family members to save her, a young woman finally gets someone to bribe the executioner and he agrees to let her go. In New World versions, which come mostly out of the African-American tradition, the protagonist tends to be male and the outcome is not always so happy. Zeppelin\u2019s version starts with a calm vocal and acoustic guitar, gradually increasing in volume and intensity as mandolin, banjo, drums and finally electric guitar are added. Plant\u2019s plaintive voice also gradually crescendos as he first begs his brother to bribe the hangman with money and then begs his sister to offer sex in an attempt to save himself. In a screaming wail, Plant sings the final verse where, having gotten silver and gold from his brother and blazing hot sex with his sister, the hangman laughingly mocks his victim as he proceeds to hang him anyway. In the end, the hangman seems almost drunk with blood-lust, his song devolving into breathless repetition and snatches of nursery rhyme. Very dark, and darker when you know the tradition and how the song has changed. ",
