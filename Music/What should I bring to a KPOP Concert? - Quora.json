            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t really need to bring much, just yourself! There are a few things though that I would suggest. Now I\u2019ve actually only been to one concert, and it wasn\u2019t your average K-pop concert, so I don\u2019t know a whole lot, but I am going to a Monsta X concert soon. The concert I went to was Day6, so they didn\u2019t dance around or anything but I\u2019m pretty sure what I brought you can bring to any concert. Since it was my first concert I didn\u2019t really know what to bring, but I\u2019m glad I brought what I did. So I actually made my own sign (I don\u2019t know why I did I was in the very back of the venue but whatever), and I didn\u2019t use it because I was in the back of the venue and I didn\u2019t want to block people\u2019s view. The sign actually ended up falling out of my purse so yes I was kind of sad about that but there is nothing I can do about that now. Another really good one I should have put first is merch. Now I went full out here. I made my own Day6 headband out of felt and glitter and it looked amazing but I ended up not wearing it because it was annoying and again blocked peoples view. I also made my own stickers and I decorated my purse with them (I almost lost these stickers too but I still have them so its all good). I made a locket necklace containing one of the members as well and wore that all night (I got a compliment on that one, it was a really cool necklace). Last but not least I wore my (awesome) Day6 tshirt and then bought a hoodie at the venue that I wore as well. So yeah, you could say I was a bit excited about my first K-pop concert. Just wait until you hear the rest. Binoculars. Yes, I brought binoculars. I mean, I was in the back of the venue, and I\u2019m that person who loves to see her idols up close with my own two eyes, so yeah. I think that was seriously the best choice I have ever made. Sitting in the back I could see their faces, but not much. I was satisfied with that, but the binoculars just made it even more amazing. You see your idols up close and seriously it seemed like I could reach out and touch them. Just watching them perform like that was amazing, and it really was surreal. OH and I also got some amazing photos with them. Being the super smart person I am (haha no) I put my phone up to the lens and so it zoomed in my camera, and I got perfectly clear close up shots of them. It was seriously amazing. But you don\u2019t have to bring these, especially if you are in the front row/pit or you just don\u2019t feel like bringing them. (you could bring a small pair, mine were very large so it was easier to see them but you do you). And that brings me to my next thing to bring, a phone. The venues wont usually let you bring big cameras (mine didn\u2019t) so I brought my phone instead. I just used mine for photos and videos (A lot of them, I always want to remember as best I can). Make sure to have storage on your phone. I ran out 3/4 of the way in and had to use my moms phone for the rest. Now take advice from me and don\u2019t spend the whole concert just trying to get the best shots or videos, I kind of did that and I regret it but I enjoyed the concert so much anyways. Just don\u2019t focus on that and enjoy yourself and the music. And if you are bringing a phone, bring a portable phone charger. You don\u2019t realize how fast those things die until you are halfway through your favorite song and your phone decides to go wack on you. Now this is optional, but a lightstick. I actually didn\u2019t buy the Day6 lightband, I didn\u2019t have the money and you don\u2019t really need a lightstick. Yes they are fun, but they are also expensive so if you don\u2019t have one it\u2019s not like you\u2019re a terrible fan. I really wanted the lightband, yes, but it turned out not many people brought one and so they really aren\u2019t a must have. But I will say that if you do have the money and you want it, go right ahead. I actually bought the Monsta X lightstick not too long ago because I am going to their concert and I didn\u2019t have a lightstick for the first one so I thought it would be fun. So it\u2019s not like they are bad, they are really fun and a great way to show off your support I\u2019m just saying if you don\u2019t have one its not the end of the world (but yes they are really cool and I honestly wanted an excuse to buy the Monsta X one because it\u2019s my favorite lightstick besides the Carat Bong) Last but not least, water and food. Now usually you can\u2019t actually bring these, but you just want to make sure you are hydrated and fed well before you go and jump around at a concert. If there is water at the venue though, buy it. You will need it. Trust me. I hope this helped, it\u2019s all I can think of but I hope it helps you out! None of these you have to bring, it\u2019s just what I brought but you do you. If you are going to a concert, have fun!!! It\u2019s really such an amazing experience. :) ",

It\u2019s not technically a requirement, but it\u2019ll really boost the experience by being part of those cool waves and etc!Bottled water.Extra money. You might want to buy some nice things you see in the merch shops and stuff, but also you will need it to buy food probably since they may ask you to get rid of the food you already have. Plus money is always handy to have.Toiletries. You gotta stay clean and you don\u2019t wanna feel all icky!Camera / Phone. You may want to film some of it! Remember not to watch the whole concert through your camera though but you may want to film a bit but if you want to film a lot you may want to bring two things for recording with.Portable Charger. Your phone battery could die and that would NOT be good!",

A tiny water bottle would work.Bring a portable charger.

(I went to the Citi Gield Concert for BTS and left immediately after the concert ended.)Have a great time. Don't record too much. Take it as much as you can with your eyes.Wear what you think would be comfortable whether it's sneakers or heels (I wouldn't wear heels in GA though, haha.)Make sure to find out if you can just scan your tickets on your phone or if you have to print them out.I would eat before the concert but something light. (Half a sandwich, a small salad, etc.)",
