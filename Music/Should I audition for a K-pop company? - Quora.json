            "answer_text": "You should audition for a K-Pop company. Why? Because there is absolutely no harm in doing so. You seem just as qualified as any other girl auditioning is. Companies that I would suggest for you: Loen- They have a lot of sub-companies. This will increase your chances of debuting. For example, THE BOYZ are under a sub-company in LOEN. From what I remember, 2\u20133 out of their members are foreigners. Pledis- While PLEDIS is a terrible company, if you want a quicker and easier acceptance to be a trainee this is the company. They have multiple Chinese idols under their label. Who knows? Maybe if you make it on time, you might be able to replace Kyla.(who hasn\u2019t actively participated in PRISTIN\u2019s performances for a while). Yuehua- Yuehua is mainly a Chinese company but they also have global productions as well. There won\u2019t be any ethnicity-based discrimination here. Yuehua is actually a pretty good company in general. Woolim- From what I remember, Woolim hasn\u2019t debuted a new girl group in a while. There is a high chance that they are looking to take in trainees. Also, if you are accepted as a trainee, there is a high chance you will get to debut. Banana Culture- EXID is a very successful girl group. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they would be trying to recreate EXID. Overall, try smaller companies when you debut. Try to learn BASIC singing/rapping. Honestly, if you\u2019re not already a good singer, try to learn how to rap. AVOID BIG 3: SM: Already has enough girls to make a girl group. It\u2019s not worth it to try to make that debut when they have so many girl trainees fighting for maybe 9 spots. JYP: They are already debuting a new girl group. Plus, they also have enough trainees to make a girl group. If you REALLY want to try a big 3 company, then you might as well try this one. YG: It\u2019s not worth it. They take girl trainees and leave them out to dry. Just don\u2019t. By the way, you might have a chance because they are looking for better looking idols. YG is slowly become a visuals company. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, yes you should. Companies are accepting more foreigners, especially East Asian, and you so happen to be Chinese. Why do I mention that? Well, they have a lot of Chinese idols and trainees, giving you a higher chance. Also, you clearly have the talent AND you\u2019re learning Korean. You don\u2019t need to know Korean when auditioning, but they consider a big bonus when a foreigner already knows it. A tip: Try learning at least some basic phrases in other Asian languages too. Especially Chinese and Japanese. Also, maybe learn sOMETHING on an instrument. They like trainees who know how to play one or two instruments. Anyways, with all of the reasons above, you should. Now, on to the second part: What companies should you audition for? I think JYP and YG are some good ones\u2026but please..PLEASE don\u2019t try for SM. SM treats their trainees and idols like crap, care too much about looks, have crazy diets, and makes most trainees/idols have plastic surgery. For you and your own mental/psychical health\u2019s sake, don\u2019t do it. Now on to why you should audition to JYP and YG! JYP: They treat their trainees/idols nicely, have people who are there if you need mental help, don\u2019t do insane diets, don\u2019t care about looks much, and have a pretty chill founder. YG: They also treat their trainees/idols pretty good, and they care about talent WAY more than they do looks. YG himself is also a nice guy. I would also like to note that they accept foreigners a lot more than other companies, especially YG. Also, if you don\u2019t make it to either of them, try and try again (wait a little bit and improve, of course). JYP personally likes people who don\u2019t give up too. And, if you feel like all hope\u2019s lost with these companies, try Woolin or FNC. Woolin treats trainees and idols like family, FNC is pretty nice, and they\u2019re both also more open to foreigners. Hope this helps! Maybe we can see each other as trainees if I somehow get in (I bet you will), and, even better- I hope I see you as a future idol jamming out to your groups\u2019 songs XD Best of luck! ",
