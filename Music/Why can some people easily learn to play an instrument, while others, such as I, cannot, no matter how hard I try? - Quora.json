            "answer_text": "The assumption that I find suspect in this question is the premise that people learn music easily. Why do you think people learn music easily- is this an observation you've made personally? Are you watching them in the practice room? Learning music is difficult enough that the majority of people need to take lessons with an experienced instructor to master their instrument (or even just to gain proficiency). Some people are \u201cself-taught\u201d which actually means that they watch others play, pick up things from other people along the way and spend many hours in a room listening to music and trying to figure it out. It's true that some people may learn faster than others- they're also usually practicing more- a lot more. It's true that some people may have physical issues that make things hard- maybe dyslexia, tone deafness, or just difficulty remembering things. Tone deaf people however can't recognize pitch and their speaking voices reflect this. If you have a \u201cnormal\u201d sounding speaking voice you probably aren't tone deaf. Some people have hands that aren't suitable for certain instruments- problems that could possibly be overcome with a custom built instrument. The other thing that makes learning hard is your instrument-is it set up properly? Is it good enough quality to learn on? Small adjustments can make a big difference in the playability of an instrument. Regarding reading music- reading can be tough to learn. I've been teaching guitar for a living for twenty years. Reading tablature is so easy I spend five minutes teaching it to my students. We could easily spend five years becoming proficient at reading standard notation. Regardless, asking this question online where no one really knows what you are doing isn't the way to ask your question. You need to go have lessons with an experienced instructor who can look at what you're doing and help you solve your problems. Everyone's got problems. What we do is think of ways to solve them. My instrument was difficult for me to learn- I spent hours and hours for years working on it and studying with lots of teachers- even traveling abroad to do so. I've also been teaching long enough to know that most people don't just pick it up and learn easily- it's a process that takes effort and time and constant conversation and corrections. It's only when students have gotten to a certain level that things look \u201ceasy\u201d. It may seem counterintuitive but technique is often about doing the least amount of work- only the necessary amount of effort required to do the job. So, if you're trying really hard, perhaps you're trying too hard. You need someone to show you how to do the right movements to get what you want and the right way of thinking to get where you need to go. So, don't lose heart or give up so easily. My best students are not the most smartest most talented ones- they're the ones that don't give up. Once you get past the hardest part the rewards are bountiful. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Your assumption that learning an instrument is \"easy\" for some is incorrect. Instruments vary in their learning curves but at some point with any instrument the student will hit a technical or musical barrier that he or she will need to struggle to get past. However, as a teacher, I have certainly observed that some students \"get it\" enough to even begin to make music while others never seem to. I am thoroughly convinced that people who have this difficulty are the ones without easy access to their right brain. Such people approach music as if they are reading a manual for how to assemble some kit without a clear connection to what they are putting together. The suggestion has been made for such people to \"listen to more music\" but that often doesn't work, because from my experience, such people also listen to music in an analytical and efficient manner. \"Oh, that's Born in the USA.......... done listening, devote no more neural or psychological energy to this.\" Our desire for short cut and efficiency is counterproductive when it comes to connecting to music. My suggestion for people who seem to be or think that they are unmusical, and who want to be musical, is to Listen to really bizarre music, such as Schoenberg, progressive jazz, foreign chants, odd meter Balkan dance music. If you choose anything vocal, make sure the lyrics are in a language you don't understand. Pick a selection of five of the most wacked out selections you can find on Youtube and listen to them repeatedly. Do not have it playing in the background. Totally focus on it. On your second or third listen, see if you can predict what is coming next. If there is any melody in it, try to hum along, and don't judge yourself if you fail, because EVERYONE who tries this fails. The goal is not \"success,\" (that's a left brain thing) but making yourself listen hard enough to even try it. Try to be in a relaxed and happy state of mind when you do this. I can't emphasize enough to NOT JUDGE YOURSELF, just be in the moment with this weird music. Sing along with everything you listen to, weird or more conventional. Even if you can't carry a tune in a bucket. Singing establishes a stronger connection between you and the music, and forces you to maintain that connection. \"Unmusical\" people have the tendency to disconnect from the music as soon as they have 'counted coup' intellectually, and this usually means identifying the song or piece. Take a dance class from a good dance instructor. The good instructors go slow on the moves and make sure everyone connects the moves to the music before going to the next move. The bad instructors overwhelm you with too many moves and you totally lose the connection with the music, and hence the point of dancing in the first place. Your goal, more than being a great dancer, is to feel the moves your feet and hips are making in the music. There are reasons why certain dance moves go well with certain music and others do not. I think the cha-cha-cha is perhaps the easiest dance groove to connect to the footwork, even though it's not a stylish dance any more. Orff classes are very good for establishing rhythm. Orff classes are typically for children and you would feel kind of weird in them, but if you have a child you can put your child in it and possibly observe and soak it in as a side effect. Or there are also some Orff videos on the great wild internet. When you finally get an instrument in your hands, keep the music in mind as you learn to play the instrument. If this is difficult for you, keep a recording of your music handy to play to yourself as you struggle with fingerings, positions, embrouchure, or whatever. I think that the difference between those so-called \"gifted\" people and the rest is that the gifted ones are so connected to the music that they feel it immediately when what they are doing \"works,\" and so they are able to repeat it and home in on it much faster. The so called \"non gifted\" ones do exactly the same fiddling with their instrument, but they don't connect the dots and hear it when it works, so they don't know when they have done it \"right.\" ",
