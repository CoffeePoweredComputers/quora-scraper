            "answer_text": "Yes, they did. I don't really know what to say because to be honest, I expected something better like it just reminds me of other Kpop group\u2019s songs, and to be honest I find it also very repetitive. I bet you that if another group made this song it would not be as popular, it's only because Blackpink has a massive fanbase and they have not had a comeback in basically 2 years. I also think that BTS won't break it as easy because BTS makes music quite often which to me is better then waiting 2 years, but because black pink has not had a comeback in 2 years fans are so excited so they stream and stream, and I understand because I mean if BTS did not make a comeback in 2 years and finally release a song, I would be so excited and stream all day long. Also for some reason, youtube just deletes most of BTS\u2019s views so even if they break black pinks record youtube won't show it or delete the views, it's like what happened to ON (I'm still pissed about that) And they also delete views from their older music videos too, like I saw youtube delete some views from blood sweat and tears. so anyway I'm not hating on the girls I respect them I just prefer BTS music more and there is nothing wrong with that.

            "answer_text": "BTS first had the record for the most viewed in under 24 hours with Boy with Luv which had 74 million views, however as far as I remember, Blackpink broke that record with 82.4 million views as well as breaking the record of the fastest music video or I think video to reach 10 million likes with the original record being Camila Cabello and Shawn Mendes\u2019 Se\u00f1orita in 41 days, Blackpink broke that record in 2 days. A reminder that records are made to be broken, unless the category is incredibly diverse and unique in the sense of which no one knows about it, they WILL be broken. Music Video views and likes are something which future artists and their comebacks or Youtubers will break. No one will keep those titles as time goes by but they will be remembered. UPDATE: Blackpink has now broken the record of fastest video to reach 200 million views breaking Taylor Swift\u2019s Look what you made me do in 7 days and 6 hours. Spread butter, not hate xx ",
