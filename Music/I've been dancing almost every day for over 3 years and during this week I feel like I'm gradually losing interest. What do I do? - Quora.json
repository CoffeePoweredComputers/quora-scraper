            "answer_text": "Yeah, I hear you\u2026 I\u2019ve been dancing since 2007, and for half of that time, it was every day too. So I get what you\u2019re feeling. Now, I don\u2019t know why you started dancing in the first place? But reconnecting with that reason is a great way to anchor back into more positive feelings about dance. When we lose interest, it tends to be because we\u2019re just not seeing any point or reason to it anymore. It\u2019s either we\u2019re not reaching our goal (which would mean it\u2019s a self-image issue). Or that we\u2019re just not enjoying dancing anymore (which can be a purpose). Neither is right nor wrong, and both can be resolved. But first, it requires you to tap back into the reasons WHY you wanted to dance? Once you\u2019re connected to that feeling again, let that guide what you do in dance. Meaning, do dance for the reasons that matter to you, not because you have to do it every day. That\u2019s the surest way to kill any passion. Tap back into the emotion, the feeling of joy, freedom, flow, presence, carefreeness, any thing that dance made you feel initially! And from that place, listen to what your soul wants to do and how it wants to express itself through dancing \u2728 ",

            "answer_text": "I have a very positive attitude towards dancing because it helps to reduce your body tension and make you relax, calm and cool. As you have mentioned above that you love to dance but suddenly losing interest so it could have occurred because of the following things: 1:You recently might have experienced something sad (financial, relationship or parental issues) it's human nature when we are in stress and tension we start avoiding things even those that we love. 2: Maybe you are going to take a very big decision in your life or something very different is going to happen in future due to which you are anxious. 3:As you are dancing for a very long time so just take a break and let just go with flow maybe your body needs rest. 4:Change your routine activities because we start getting bore about things that occurs, in the same manner, add exercise, observing the landscape and playing with kids if possible. 5:Due to the current situation of COVID-19 many people have been experiencing these symptoms because no one knows when this situation will be over and how things will work out. 6:If you wanted to know exactly what is going on in your mind just start writing a diary on daily basis and observe it on weekends and you will be able to see a common schema (like things that are bothering you and you keep on thinking about them). And try to work on them. ",
