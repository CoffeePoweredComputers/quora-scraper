            "answer_text": "First of all, do not get me wrong, I like Charlie. He is a Civil War collector like I am, a cancer survivor like I am, he\u2019s been married to one woman all this time like me, and I hear he\u2019s a very nice guy. Charlie was exactly what Keith Richards wanted. A solid, no frills drummer. If you listen to Keith\u2019s solo albums, his session drummers are the same, solid, no frills drummers. Another plus for Charlie is that he had a great sounding kit, and didn\u2019t need a thousand drums. I\u2019ve been professional drummer for forty years. I\u2019ve done session/studio drumming, I\u2019ve played in bands, filled in for touring drummers that could not make the gig like J D Blair for Shania Twain, Mick Curry for Bryan Adams, Omar Martinez for Paul Revere and The Raiders, Robb Bachman for Bachman Turner Overdrive. I have toured with Roxette on their Join the Joyride Tour across Canada, toured with Sophie B Hawkins and Alannah Myles twice to name a few. Yes, I\u2019m a Canadian drummer and I feel I know what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to ruffle some feathers though. Again Charlie was perfect for The Stones. However, with the English invasion, Charlie was the most basic, basic drummer of that era. Mick Avery of the Kinks, who was with the Stones for awhile but maybe a little too flashy, John Steel of the Animals, Freddy Marsden of Gerry and the Pacemakers, Norman Kuhlke of The Swinging Blue Jeans and especially Ringo Starr were all better drummers. Why? Because they could do rolls and fills. They could do more than just lay down a beat. Charlie cannot do rolls. The only clear roll I heard Charlie do was on Get Off Of My Cloud, over and over and over again, same basic fill that my students could do after one week of lessons. All the others fills and rolls of Charlie\u2019s are messy, blurred and incoherent. BUT, he\u2019s solid and has great timing. Ringo\u2019s fills are clear, sharp and superbly done. Lots of questions on Quora pit Ringo against Charlie. Ringo was far better than Charlie, his rolls and fills were well thought out and clear as a bell. Charlie\u2019s I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re muffled, and muddled. And please don\u2019t bring up the jazz thing. I taught drumming for many years, jazz included. Many of my jazz students could rival Charlie in one year of lessons. Charlie is a very basic jazz drummer. However, he loves jazz and goes out and plays it with some top musicians. That\u2019s great. He has made millions laying down the beat for the Stones without breaking a sweat, that\u2019s great. Does he care what people say about him, like me, I doubt it. I love listening to the Stones, love the sound of Charlie\u2019s Gretch kit, and enjoy watching Charlie on interviews. He\u2019s a very humble, down to earth guy. I like Charlie, but he is just a basic drummer. Is he a \u2018good\u2019 drummer? Yes, he is good in that he can lay down a solid beat. Is he a great, fantastic drummer? No, not at all. The people who say he\u2019s the greatest drummer ever, have no idea about drumming. Many people answering this question are not drummers Charlie is a basic drummer who just keeps a good solid beat and he\u2019s happy with that. I would say he\u2019s a good drummer but not a \u2018really\u2019 good drummer. Many ask who\u2019s better, Ringo or Charlie. I\u2019m so tired of seeing this question asked over and over again which is actually why I started writing this. Ringo is better of course. Ringo was and is a much, much better drummer. In a drum battle Ringo would win hands down. The truth is, Ringo could play every Stones song with no problem. However Charlie could not do half the songs of The Beatles. It\u2019s just a fact. I\u2019ve played Stones songs and I\u2019ve played Beatle songs. Stone songs put me to sleep, Beatle songs are a ball to play. I like Charlie and I like listening to the Stones, I love Keith. I would give anything to jam with Keith. But I\u2019m sorry; Charlie is a very basic rock drummer, good, but basic. And, an extremely basic jazz drummer. I used to tell my drum students to play to Stones records for practise for a reason. Stone\u2019s songs are easy to play drums to. I have yet to hear Charlie do a thought provoking drum fill. Sorry Charlie. BUT, that is Charlie\u2019s style of drumming, he\u2019s okay with it, it works for him and he\u2019s made millions. But it drives me crazy when people say he\u2019s an awesome drummer who has his roots in jazz and is better than Ringo. Those who say that, have no idea about drumming. Below is a video from You Tube of Charlie going head to head in the battle of the drummers with two other jazz drummers, Steve White & Gilson Lavis. Charlie has aged and by now should have some great rolls and fills in his repertoire. You decide for yourself how Charlie, the jazz drummer does against them.  ",

            "answer_text": "I've never seen Charlie Watts play technically challenging fills. Granted he's plays rock steady and is very proficient for the songs he performs, but overall, how good a drummer is Charlie? \u201cTechnically challenging fills\u201d is a meaningless phrase mainly seen in drumming magazines and Internet forums. It\u2019s mainly used by armchair drummers that are more easily dazzled by fancy moves than by what a drummer adds to a song. Charlie Watts, like Keith Richards, is a riffmeister. He plays fairly simple, but memorable drum parts that are perfect for Stones music. There are many Stones songs that I could easily identify just by hearing the drums only. Charlie, especially on the earlier Stones music, often added a recurring drum riff that he\u2019d use throughout a song, just like Keith Richards did on guitar. One example is Get Off My Cloud. That drum riff makes the whole song. Only Charlie could have come up with that. So, to my way of thinking, a \u201cgood drummer\u201d is one that adds something musically meaningful to his bands music. Using that criteria, Charlie is one of the best. ",
