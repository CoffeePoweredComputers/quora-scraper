            "answer_text": "In this current generation if you ask me , I have to say it has to be Eminem Or Kendrick Lamar : If I had to answer this question , some time in 2017 , I would surely say it was Kendrick Lamar . He is such a unique rapper , with a unique flow , sick beats and lyrics are pretty good too. Singles like Swimming Pools , Alright and Humble are one of favourites from an artist in recent times. Now i think it\u2019s pretty clear why i mentioned 2017 over here, yeah your right. Its the year Eminem\u2019s \u2018 Revival \u2018 dropped , or should i say , tripped so bad , I legit don\u2019t have words. Now there is no denying that Em is one of the greatest rappers of all time and I personally consider him at the likes of Biggie and Pac , but this decade he dropped two of the most not - so exciting albums , Revival and MMLP2. Now don\u2019t get me wrong MMLP2 was awesome , but not as good as his previous works. Now after revival I thought there was no coming back for em\u2019 but , after all he\u2019s the shady and he came back with a perfect reply A diss album : Kamikaze Now , this was Eminem\u2019s most fierce album up to date , takin shots at The mumble rapping community ( which i think is really shit , considering they call themselves rappers ) ,The critics and also Agent Orange xD\u2026. Donald trump This shows em at his lyrical best by spitting new flows , styles and also taking his lyrical game up a notch . And also this was also a turning point for em\u2019 in the decade , and marked as a comeback of a dying rapper . It also ignited the infamous MGK vs Em rivalry which was the talk of 2018. Though, MGK had a pretty dope disstrack , the best anyone has ever aimed at Em , Killshot truly, destroyed it. Now ,fast forward to year 2020 , the year I am writing in ( if future people read this, glad you could make it , and sorry that your history books gon be messed up ) Em released a new album Music to be murdered by Now, I loved every song on this album too . Especially \u2018 darkness \u2018 a true Eminem song . Also there was Godzilla , where again Eminem shows us that he is one of the fastest in the game , there was , as usual a collaboration with Royce da 5\u20199 in\u2019 You Gon\u2019 Learn \u2018. He also teamed up with Kid cudi , for the song \u2018 Adventures of Moon man and Slim Shady \u2018 a song with a beautiful beat and flow. There are many masterpiece songs in here. And it was truly a great one . So now as you can make out I really think ( my personal opinion ) that Eminem is the greatest rapper of this generation alongside Kendrick who in my opinion has been just as good.   So this is my answer , hope you liked it , pardon some grammatical mistakes ,wrote it in a bit hurry so , can\u2019t help it , i\u2019m a human after all :) Also if you ask me , this would be my list for the top rappers of this generation: EminemKendrick LamarLogicTech9neJ coleJoyner LucasLil wayneKanye WestDrakeIf you liked the answer , please do me an honour by upvoting . Thank you . Peace ! ",

            "answer_text": "I'll tell you who COULD have been. This young man.  I started listening to XXXTENTACION in late 2015. He was popping up all over the underground rap scene. When I checked out his SoundCloud (which had only a few songs at this point) the first one I listened to was Look At Me! After listening to that song, I dismissed him as a garbage mumble rapper. He wasn't doing anything different from anyone else in the rap game currently. Fast forward to early 2017. I'm in my sophomore year of high school, and X's name starts floating around again. I'm shocked to hear Look at Me! being blasted through the hallways. This was about the time that X had been locked up for his domestic abuse allegations (which I'll get to). As such, he'd blown up overnight. I decided to give him another chance. It'd been 2 years; surely he'd improved since then. And he had. With deep songs like Riot and I Spoke To The Devil in Miami, I was starting to see his depth as an artist. He quickly dominated my playlists and became my favorite rapper. I cheered along with everyone else when he was released in March. From here on out I closely followed Mr. Onfroy. He didn't \u201ccure my depression\u201d or anything like that, but I liked his music. He released his first album, \u201c17\u201d, which completely blew me away. This was a guy that went from rapping around putting holes in people's parents to singing around a girl he'd known who had committed suicide. That's where I realized that X could become a great. His potential was off the charts. Then this happened.  The Pitchfork article. Seemingly proving every allegation against X correct, the article had so much information that seemed factual, that it was hard to ignore. X was again locked up. Now, I'd known about X's allegations for a while. But that's all I thought they were; allegations. As I read the article, X's character took a huge dive for me. If what they were saying was true, then X probably should be locked up. Regarding the allegations, I don't know if they were true or not. The case was dropped after he died, so\u2026 Personally, I believe that he probably did what he was accused of. But my take was that he did those terrible things in his past, and that he was a different person. Besides, art should be separated from the artist. Someone's music should not be \u201ccancelled\u201d (hate that term) because of their character. If you like their work, you're allowed to. I'm not discarding what he was accused of, but we don't actually know if he did those things or not. So I'm not going to dwell on it any further. Enter 2018. He's out of prison (on house arrest), and working around the clock on his new album, \u201c?\u201d. He's dyed his hair blue, and I began to see a real change in X. For one, he didn't lose his cool over everything, like he used to. His music was temporarily removed from Spotify because of the allegations, but he didn't comment on it. When Spotify reversed their policy, X took to Instagram to say that he hadn't wanted to say anything because there was no reason to, but he was grateful to artists like Kendrick Lamar who stood up for him and helped him. \u201c?\u201d finally dropped. And let me tell you, it was one of the best albums I've ever heard. X completely changed it up on this album. We had depressing stuff, rock music, pop songs. He even included a Spanish track. I had the album on repeat for weeks after. At the same time, X was become more and more of a caring person. He uploaded a video on his YouTube channel entitled \u201c#THEHELPINGHANDCHALLENGE\u201d where he donated tons of games, food, and just basic necessities to shelters all over Broward County, where he grew up. It's a very heartwarming video. He also started posting daily motivation quotes on his social media (he had posted positive things before, but never daily)   And then, the worst happened. He died. When I heard the news, I didn't believe it, initially. After all, people had thought he'd killed himself before, when he posted a picture of the Look At Me! video. As the day went by, though, everyone was saying he was shot, that he was in critical condition/dead. Finally, the Broward County sheriffs confirmed on their Twitter that he was gone. Since then, there hasn't been a day where I haven't thought about him. The guy had so much potential. He was killed for a bag. A Louie bag. Posthumous music is slowly but surely being released, and his son was born a few months ago. He will live on in those things. Regardless of what you think about him, what he may or may not have done, he was a kid. A 20 year old kid who didn't deserve to die like that. And he had more to offer to the world. I suggest you check out his music, especially his newer stuff. He has something for everyone. And if you want to leave a hate comment \u201cbUt He BeAt HiS GiRlfrIeNd!!1!\u201d please don't. You aren't accomplishing anything. Long live Jahseh Onfroy, aka XXXTENTACION. You will not be forgotten.  ",
