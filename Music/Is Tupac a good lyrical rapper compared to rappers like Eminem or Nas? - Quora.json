            "answer_text": "Tupac was not a lyricist. Let\u2019s be honest, he wasn\u2019t as bad as some rappers lyrically, but lyricism is supposed to go beyond that. Tupac\u2019s wordplay was pathetic, especially when compared to insane lyricists like Nas. Tupac was great at making the listener really feel what his song was about. His word choice was viable, not confusing and not overly simple. Nas on the other hand relays stories better than Tupac, has much better wordplay, uses many literary techniques, and is overall just a better rapper than Tupac. Tupac created the well-recognized diss track Hit \u2019Em Up, but Nas created the ultimate diss track Ether. Here are a couple of their tracks: Nas - NY State of Mind  Tupac - Brenda\u2019s Got A Baby  Nas - Represent  Tupac - Thugz Mansion  Nas - Halftime  Tupac - I Ain\u2019t Mad At\u2019cha  Nas feat. Lauryn Hill - If I Ruled the World  Hopefully that answers your question. I tried to give examples ",
