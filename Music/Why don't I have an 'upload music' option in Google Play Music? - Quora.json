Next, see if clearing your data and history on your browser helps.You could also remove the Google Play Music extension, clear your data, and then reinstall the extension. Make sure that your browser and Flash is updated. Next, restart your pc and see if the issue is still there. Also, have you tried other browsers to see if the issue is still there?
