            "answer_text": "This guy is none other than   Teddy Park (Park Hong Jun, \ubc15\ud64d\uc900) from YG Entertainment. He is a songwriter, producer and a Korean-American rapper. He debuted in a hip-hop group called 1TYM way back. And he once refused Lady Gaga's offer to work together just to focus more on 2NE1. He had produced many hit songs from the 2nd generation (maybe way back from the 1st gen) until now. I'll list some of his works (some are not entirely his but has a part) that you might know from the 2nd generation until now. 2008 Sunset Glow - BigbangOnly Look At Me - TaeyangD.I.S.C.O - Uhm Jong Hwa ft.

Strange how KRUNK's name is not Teddy. Well Teddy was born first before KRUNK so. XD  Out of all the producers, he is probably one of the famous (or maybe the most famous if you only knew him), even though he is not a k-idol. Honorable Mentions: G-Dragon (Bigbang)Hui (Pentagon)B.I, Bobby (iKON)Namjoon (BTS)Shinsadong Tiger (produced Momoland's Boom Boom and Baam, has a company that manages EXID under him)Tablo (Epik High)Seungyoon, Seunghoon, Mino (Winner)Soyeon (G Idle)CL (2NE1)LE (EXID)Edit: Woozi (Seventeen)Guys I didn't know he could compose XD and to those who didn't know, I wanna share it with yaa Edit: Suga (BTS)",
