            "answer_text": "It is quite impossible to name just a few songs out of the millions of beautiful songs out there created by very talented musicians. This is a song by the late Dr. Rajkumar who won the National Award for singing this song.  Fun fact - Dr. Rajkumar as far as I know is the only person who has won the National Award for both - Acting and singing. One of the song which comes to my mind is from the movie Guna -  Music by the great Maestro Ilaiyaraaja would be one of the beautiful songs ever made in my opinion. Watched this a few weeks ago which I found to be very beautiful :  The fact that Amit Trivedi pulled in musicians from across India and had them perform shows the versatility that we have.! I picked these songs from the top of my head when I read the question. Hope you guys enjoy.! Cheers.! ",
