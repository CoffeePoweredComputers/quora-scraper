            "answer_text": "Apparently only Ayman Abu Aita, the Palestinian grocer in Bruno. Terms undisclosed; Aita had asked for $115m. Palestinian settles lawsuit against Sacha Baron Cohen, David Letterman over 'Bruno' film [Eita] went to the interview that appeared in 'Bruno' thinking he was talking to a journalist about peace activism, his court complaint said. Instead, the movie spurred death threats against him, damaged his business and made him fear for his family's safety, the complaint said. Discussed by NYT 2018\u201308\u201319: Sacha Baron Cohen Pranked Me, Can I Sue? Yes. Win? Not So Much., which also mentions the \u201cWho is America?\u201d targets. \u201cIf I were a lawyer for a potential plaintiff who came into me and said this happened, my first question would be, \u2018Did you sign a piece of paper?\u2019\u201d said John Rosenberg, a media and entertainment lawyer. In [Aita\u2019s] case, unlike some of the others, the lawsuit revolved around whether Mr. Cohen\u2019s portrayal was false. \u201cOne critical distinction appears to be that it was Cohen\u2019s words there, i.e., his branding of Aita as a terrorist,\u201d Mr. Rosenberg said in an email, \u201cand not Aita\u2019s own comments, that provided the basis for his defamation claim.\u201d And, as a lawyer for Mr. Aita noted at the time, Mr. Aita had not done what so many other targets had done \u2014 signed a release. \u2026 Another potential legal avenue is to argue that the show defamed a person or, as allowed in some states, cast him or her in a false light. Defamation, however, requires a false statement. In the case of \u201cWho Is America?,\u201d no one who has threatened to sue has said that Mr. Cohen made a false statement about them. The issue instead has been their own words or actions. \u201cA person cannot defame themselves,\u201d Mr. Rosenberg said. False light claims, which are rare, center on whether a person has been embarrassed by being portrayed in a misleading way. In Mr. Walsh\u2019s case, he has contended that the piece was edited to create a misimpression that he was endorsing a policy of arming kindergartners in the United States. According to Mr. Walsh, he was actually told that the remarks he read off a teleprompter concerned a program in Israel. For Borat, participants had signed a disclaimer which had lots of fine print, which pretty much gave him free license. People who unsuccessfully sued: Borat: Legal action by participants Alabama etiquette teacher Cindy Streit hired high-profile attorney Gloria Allred, who demanded that the California Attorney General investigate fraud allegedly committed by Baron Cohen and the film's producers [article]. But that doesn\u2019t seem to have gone anywhere and Streit/Allred didn\u2019t actually sue.The villagers of Glod, RomaniaTwo of the University of South Carolina fraternity brothers who appeared in the film, sued the producers, claiming defamation and also seeking to injunct the DVDA South Carolina resident who said he was accosted by Baron Cohen (as Borat) in the bathroom at a restaurant in downtown Columbia, with the actor allegedly making comments regarding the individual's genitals, without signing any legal waiver.The Macedonian Romani singer Esma Red\u017eepova sued the film's producers, seeking \u20ac800,000 because the film used her song \"Chaje \u0160ukarije\" without her permission. Red\u017eepova won \u20ac26,000 compensation, since it turned out that Baron Cohen had gotten permission from her production house to use the song, which she had not been notified about. [But she didn\u2019t actually sue SBC himself]Felix Cedeno, a 31-year-old American, sued 20th Century Fox for $2.25 million, after he was filmed as part of a scene where a live chicken fell out of Borat's suitcase on the subway.Baltimore math teacher/ driving-school instructor Michael Psenicska sought more than $100,000 in damages from Baron Cohen, 20th Century Fox, and other parties.Jeffrey Lemerond, who was shown running and yelling, \"Get away\" as Borat attempted to hug strangers on a New York street, filed a legal case claiming his image was used in the film illegally, and that he suffered \"public ridicule, degradation and humiliation\" as a result.Several others who suffered harm but did not sue: Humiliation, job loss for \u2018Borat\u2019 victims ____ UPDATE 2020/ Borat 2 \u2013 how Sacha Baron Cohen's prank victims feel about being tricked in the film ",
