            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know anything about V-pop so I won\u2019t include it in the answer, but if someone who is familiar with it reads it, you can write about in the comment section. International fans are used to admiring skills, talent, perfection, latest fashion and they prefer music which is more energetic, badass, noisy - genres like EDM. That\u2019s one of the reasons why J-pop is not popular worldwide.  Skills, talent, and perfection - I am not saying that J-pop artists are untalented, they definitely are skilled, but the problem is that the J-pop industry doesn\u2019t have any training period before they let the artists debut. You audition and they immediately put you in some group, while in the K-pop industry, idols have to undergo years of intense training full of competition, in which they are taught perfection before they are put into a line-up of a group. Another factor in this is also how frequently debuting new idols in the K-pop companies is. If we take AKB48 (which is a perfect example to show what I mean), they have hundreds of members and several teams in which there are always more than 15 members if I have the right knowledge.  In the K-pop industry, companies debut new groups usually after the one they debuted before reached 4\u20135 years of its existence and in every group, there are usually only around 7 members (yes, there are groups with more members but the majority of the groups don\u2019t go over 10 members). So K-pop trainees have to go through some training period before there will be plans of a new group created, while in J-pop they just debut whoever passes the audition. Every group in the K-pop industry is being created for months or even years. Especially the huge companies like SM, JYP, YG, Starship, etc. put so much effort and money to make everything perfect - concept, members, debut song, and many more. The whole K-pop industry is about perfection - idols are on stage with a goal to amaze people with their skills and talent and be their ideal types about which the fans will dream about - while in J-pop idols are sent on stage with the goal of making the people genuinely happy and be their best friends while singing and dancing to it. Latest fashion - K-pop is one big fashion week. Not only they create many trends which then spread across the world, but they are wearing what is hyped up at the moment. They are not scared to make idols look both sexy and cute, wear heavier make-up, create unique hairstyles, and make them look more like they came from the future sometimes.  K-pop make-up  J-pop make-up   I tried to pick more mature/sexy outfits in the first collage and in the second one outfits from bubblier K-pop songs.  These are the outfits everyone thinks about when someone mentions J-pop.  While this is what they wear too, but for people who are not willing to dig deeper into the genre, these outfits are hidden under thousands of AKB48\u2019s dresses. In J-pop, girl groups especially, stick with fancy and adorable dresses which have many details, patterns and are helping them with performing bubbly songs. Of course, there are groups that are trying to dress in the latest fashion too, but while K-pop is known for dressing in the fashion trends, J-pop is more known for the extra dresses worn by AKB48. If we stay at the aesthetic and visuals\u2026 The quality and aesthetics of K-pop MVs are on a whole different level than J-pop ones because everything in K-pop is created to flutter viewers' eyes and ears, their music videos are sometimes even better than many movies out there.   J-pop music videos   K-pop music videos Energetic, badass and noisy music - even J-pop have this music if you put an effort into searching for one but unlike K-pop, J-pop is generalized to be all cute and bubbly, which is not something with which you will draw the attention of international fans as much as you would show them the latest K-pop releases. The problem with J-pop is that they are very strict about protecting the rights of the producers and companies who released the songs. From what I have heard, you can only buy Japanese album in Japan (I don\u2019t know if this is one hundred percent true, cause I never tried buying one), while K-pop albums all over the internet. Because Japan is so strict with protecting the rights of musicians, it is hard to spread the music if you are a casual listener. It is up to the company to allow spreading the music more and sending their artists to the world if they want to be worldwide, but they are not doing that. J-pop companies are satisfied if they reach fame within the Japanese music industry. They are not as hungry for international fame as K-pop companies are. Here you can listen to some songs that I think you will like:     Recently there was a controversy with a Japanese idol named Tegoshi Yuya who stated in his book that K-pop groups like BTS and Twice only got popular because they have members from different countries, are from huge companies and they are able to speak English. He also stated that if J-pop groups were like that, they would be just as successful. I laughed so badly when I read it. BTS is not a group from a huge company before they reached the level of fame they have now, everybody was disrespecting them and no one took neither them nor their company seriously. Twice came from a much more known company, but still, they are a group that brought the fame of JYP to today\u2019s level. The only English speaking member of BTS is Namjoon and in Twice, no one can speak fluently. BTS doesn\u2019t have any foreign members, they are all Koreans, and Twice have Momo and Sana from Japan and Tzuyu from Taiwan, but they never used Tzuyu\u2019s nationality to promote themselves in China/Taiwan as Tegoshi stated. They promote in Japan because every group in their company do that even though they don\u2019t have Japanese members. NOW ONTO C-POP C-pop is not that much different from K-pop. In fact, they are almost the same, at least if you look at fashion, aesthetics, and skills. Chinese idols also have to train before debut and there is also huge pressure put onto being perfect.   So why the genre is not as known internationally? China is huge. All of you probably know that if you paid attention in your geography class. There are 1,440,000,000 people living there and that\u2019s why C-pop artists don\u2019t need to go to the west to promote there because if they get famous in their homeland, they can already have more fans than the majority of the K-pop groups. I will give you examples, so you will understand it better: BTS has 27,7 million followers on its official group Instagram.  BLACKPINK has 26,7 million followers on its official group account and Lisa has the most followers on her personal account (37,2 million).  TWICE has 13,8 million followers.  GOT7 has 5,9 million followers and Jackson has the most followers on his personal account (18.2 million) which is three times more than the group itself because he is also a hugely popular C-pop artist.  Here I listed the most popular K-pop groups\u2019 Instagram followers. Instagram is a worldwide platform so the majority of the fans of these groups can follow them there, but it is not used in China (even C-pop celebrities have Instagram accounts, but there are barely as active there as they are on Weibo). China has Weibo - something like a Twitter/Instagram. Luhan - you know this guy from EXO, right? He has 60 million followers there.  Jackson of GOT7 has about 25 million followers there.  Cai Xukun - K-pop fans probably know him because the majority of you shipped him with Lisa during Youth With You 2. He has about 25,5 million followers.  Lay of EXO has 50 million followers.  Victoria - she was in f(x) has about 25 million followers.  Do you see the differences? You probably never heard of many of them and yet, they still have so many followers because they are famous in China, while all of the K-pop groups I listed above have many international fans. They don\u2019t need to go promote to the west to gain more fans because unlike Korea, China is huge enough to give them an audience that will keep them relevant and give them even more money than K-pop groups who are popular in the west get. It is not like they would be lacking in sound or style, just look:       ",

China has a really big enough music market to not have to use international promotions. J-Pop\u2019s concepts wouldn\u2019t interest a lot of outsiders as they are very keen on the cute concepts and V-Pop is just well known in their own country. Also Japan is one the biggest music market in Asia, they don\u2019t need international fans. ",
