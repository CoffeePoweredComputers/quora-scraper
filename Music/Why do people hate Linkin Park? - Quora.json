            "answer_text": "The main reason is their experimentation. When Linkin Park released Hybrid Theory, every single teenager who felt angry at something was rocking out to it. The pure agression off of that record screams Come and play me if you want to get all that off your chest. Then they released another banger - Meteora. This album came packed with agressive, impulsive nasty songs like don't stay, hit the floor, lying from you, figure 09\u2026 but this record also had softer songs like breaking the habit, numb etc. Why this album was so well received and is statistically the most successful album in history is because fans loved it and all the singles from this album hit number 1 on the charts. No other album has produced 5 singles that hit number 1 on the charts. This was truly a great feat for Linkin Park and why I think they went with minutes of midnight instead of hybrid theory 3.0 is because they were afraid of letting their fans down. If they created something that can't top the last thing then they wouldn't feel like they did their job. So they changed directions. They went in the studio with the old mindset and created a banger like qwerty but as the time progressed, they went more on the rock side with songs like shadow of the day (which is a great song) Now you might be thinking: wait, isn't this exactly what their fans DIDN'T want to hear? Well you'd be right. Most of their fans screamed BETRAYAL at the top of their lungs and started burning their linkin Park merch and retriving in their anxty caves (their rooms because they got grounded for setting fire at home). So the time passed, Linkin Park still made it to number 1, and what I've done even outdid Numb in terms of chart success. Linkin Park started touring, there were still a shit load of people on their shows and they continued doing what they do. In 1 year, they'd start working on their next album A thousand Suns. Why this album is particularly important is because this is where electronic linkin Park started. The fans still gave them a lot of shit, the album still hit number 1 so they were fine with it. 1 year later they went in the studio again to make living things. This got a lot of people excited because they said \u201cwe kinda mixed everything from the past 4 albums and created this one\u201d so they thought ohh so we will get some nu metal, And they sure did\u2026 not. The album did have some heavy moments but for the most part it was mostly electronic (which is why this is my least favorite lp album). Now after 2 years the hype was real. Linkin Park announced that they were making something heavy and they didn't disappoint this time. The Hunting Party really had some bangers and had a ton of guitar solos, so Linkin Park was heading in a different direction? SIKE!!! Heavy drops. Everyone hates Linkin Park again and everyone screams betrayal again. If LP didn't give their fans false hope of returning to the old days with the hunting party then the fans would kinda expect one more light. But the thing is, not only LP fans were offended by this. Rock and nu metal fans were all offended by this. Linkin Park - the most iconic band from the 2000s and the 2010s to come up with a pop album. Everyone hates on them. I personally still am a fan of LP to this day and like all their albums. Some more then others and in this list: Hybrid theory Meteora Minutes to midnight The Hunting Party One more light A thousand Suns Living Things ",

            "answer_text": "I think every band/artist gets some hate, it just becomes more obvious as they become larger. Now I\u2019d describe Linkin Park as being \u201csomewhat hated\u201d, not quite to the same level as Nickelback, or the dreaded levels of Justin Bieber!\u2026 but I\u2019d say they do get hated slightly more than the average act. Now here\u2019s a few reasons that I\u2019ve heard of as to why; Hate from similar bands in the genre - It\u2019s kind of a \u201cmy bands better than yours\u201d thing, and to be honest in LP\u2019s case, I think it\u2019s mostly from fans of other Nu Metal bands (though LP aren\u2019t really a Nu Metal band now). I know there\u2019s beef here from fans of Deftones, Korn, and Limp Bizkit.\u201cStole\u201d the Nu Metal spotlight - Since LP have gone onto becoming the biggest Nu Metal band from around the early 2000s era (75+ million record sales to date), there\u2019s some envy here. Particularly I think from Korn fans, since their 1999 song Freak on a Leash essentially brought Nu Metal mainstream, though they never achieved quite as much success as LP did.Mainsteam hate - Any artist that becomes mainstream, means that they often become plastered EVERYWHERE: radio, TV, music stores, billboards & these days the internet. That means the vast majority of the population becomes exposed to them, without their consent, so naturally people who dislike the said artist, become sick of them.Internal hate, from the fans - Ah inception hate, you know you\u2019re a hated band when you get some of this! Besides Meteora, LP have changed their sound on all their further 5 studio albums, and fans often don\u2019t take well to this, since they like the band based on the previous sound that got the hooked. A common spectacle to observe is the \u201cWhere\u2019s my Hybrid Theory version!?\u201d, available at every new LP album release.",
