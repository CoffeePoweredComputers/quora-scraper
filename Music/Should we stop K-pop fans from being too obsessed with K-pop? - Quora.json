            "answer_text": "Okay, so my answer for this is yes and no. I\u2019m gonna state my two points here. Musically Now here\u2019s the thing, if it is simply that they like the music and choose to listen to it. Then no. There\u2019s absolutely no reason to stop them. The problem is, there is a very thin line between liking something and being obsessed with it. If they are at the point where they refuse to acknowledge any other genre of music, then yes, they should be spoken too. It isn\u2019t bad to like something, but you shouldn\u2019t simply snub any other thing similar to it just because you think that it is not as superior. KPop should not turn someone into a Koreaboo. Idols This is where my real problem comes in with the KPop culture. A lot of fans act like their idols are objects and that it is their right as a fan to own them. Let me just stop you there. If anyone reading this is one of their fans then no, it is not your right. You do not own them, they are their own person and you should not be allowed to affect the decisions that they make in their private life. Idols are humans too. We should have enough decency as fans to respect their decisions and treat them like humans, not objects. You wanna know a secret about a large majority of celebrities, idols included. They crave normality. The moment a celebrity chooses to pursue their career and passion, they give up such a large part of what we call our private lives. All they want is to be treated like a normal person. It\u2019s why you hear idols say that they would want to date someone who doesn\u2019t know who they are, because it gives them that sense of normality that they lose the moment they debut. I\u2019ve met celebrities before. I live in New Zealand, small country, hard for celebrities to hide, even in the main cities. I\u2019ve spoken to them. I\u2019ve had a couple of really interesting conversations with a few. I noticed one thing when I talked with all of them. They were all smiling. It wasn\u2019t that smile they give their fans though, it was a smile that told me that they were happy talking to me. Why? Because I made them, even if it was only for a split second, feel normal. If they are at a point where they believe that they own their idols and that they are the only people who can make decisions for the idol, talk to them. It\u2019s not healthy. Not for the idol, nor the fan. Sorry for ranting on. ",
