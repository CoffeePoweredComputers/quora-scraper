            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a bit uncertain about what you\u2019re asking. If you\u2019re asking how long the concerto is, it\u2019s 45 minutes long. It seems more likely that you are either asking how long it takes to learn the concerto or how long it takes to get good enough to be able to play it. In either case, it depends. First, a conservatory-caliber (though not necessarily conservatory-trained) cellist could learn the entire concerto in six months to a year if he\u2019s sufficiently dedicated to the task. On the other hand, an average cellist might take two or three years to master a single movement. Second, having learned many cello concertos, Dvorak is probably the second most difficult in the standard repertoire (from a technical perspective), behind only Prokofiev\u2019s Sinfonia Concertante and, depending on the cellist\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, Tchaikovsy\u2019s Rococo Variations. So, there is no question that playing the Dvorak Concerto well requires a highly competent cellist. But how long it takes to become competent depends on many factors: one\u2019s level of commitment and the quality of one\u2019s teacher\u2014just to name a couple. Even more a challenge than playing the right notes is the level of musicianship it takes to perform a 45-minute concerto while shaping every phrase with eloquence, developing each theme with purpose, and leading the audience on a coherent musical journey. A handful of kids become good enough at the cello to play the notes in Dvorak after only a few years of study. Exceedingly rare is a child who plays the concerto with a high level of musicianship. More common, many cellists are never able to perform the work at a professional level. ",
