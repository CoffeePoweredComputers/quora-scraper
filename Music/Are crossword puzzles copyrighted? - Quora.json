Constructors assign their copyright to publishers when they are published. At Puzzazz, we have chosen to do things differently. In most cases, constructors retain their copyright and license their puzzles to us for publication (the exception is when we publish a collection of puzzles from multiple authors, like The Year of Puzzles).

Which means that the constructor usually gives up all rights to his/her own work. Constructors have been railing against this system for decades, but it doesn't seem about to change anytime soon. ",
