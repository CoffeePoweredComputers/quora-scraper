            "answer_text": "Greatest rock star of all time? Probably not Greatest artist of all time? Hell yeah And I have good reason Most people think he's just another egoistic celebrity who's full of himself. Well, that may be true and maybe cutting off Taylor Swift during the MTV Awards was a dick move but 1. His music, pure fire I think he's the best rapper who ever walked on planet Earth. And if you've listened to My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, you'll know what I'm talking about. \u200eHe started off as a producer for a few rappers. Layer he figured he could take on the big boys himself. Since then, he's dropped seven albums, all of them, consistently good. And Dark Fantasy got a 10 on Pitchfork.  2. Lyrics This might be one of the more controversial aspects but check this out. \u200ePenitentiary chances, the devil dances And eventually answers to the call of Autumn All of them fallin' for the love of ballin' Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums Based off the way we was branded Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon And at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it's random But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage I need a happy ending and a new beginning And a new fitted and some job opportunities that's lucrative This the real world, homie, school finished They done stole your dreams, you don't know who did it I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS I won't be satisfied 'til all my niggas get it, get it?\" Now tell me your phone didn't burst out in flames. 3. Tweets I think we can all agree on this one. Kanye West tweets the best shit ever.    It's sad that he has quit all social media. We won't get anymore if this gold. 4. Determination Ye met with a pretty serious car accident in 2002. On his was home from a recording studio in California, he fell asleep at the wheel and crashed his car into an oncoming vehicle and shattered his jaw. Thus event is what he says have him the opportunity to do what he wanted to do. Life is life, there\u2019s ups and downs. It\u2019s like a car crash\u2014you could just be driving, and just out of nowhere it happens. The point of life is getting shit done and being happy. Two weeks after the accident, he wrote his hit single \"Through the Wire,\" and recorded it with his mouth still wired shut and worked on his first album, College Dropout, during his recovery.  5. Principles Kanye stays true to his principles. He thinks people see money and riches as a goal to strive for but really once people get there they turn into awful people. It seems we living the American dreamBut the people highest up got the lowest self esteemThe prettiest people do the ugliest thingsFor the road to riches and diamond rings He talks about this is many of his songs He recognizes that people are controlled by consumerism and that control creates a reality for many that holds us back and doesn\u2019t allow us to enjoy life as much as we can. He says brand names are so engrained in our psyche and our daily lives that we can\u2019t help but chase them. The list can go on and on but let's stop it right there. Respect, Mr. West. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh Sweet Jesus, No. He\u2019s not even a real Rock Star. Some examples of real and Great Rock Stars (just a few examples, not complete by any stretch): Geddy Lee - Rush Rober Plant - Led Zeppelin Malcomn Young (RIP) - AC/DC John Lennon - The Beatles Axl Rose - Guns n Roses and AC/DC Ian Anderson - Jethro Tull Steve Howe - Yes Dwayne Allman (RIP) - Allman Brothers Roger Daultry - The Who Paul Rogers - Bad Company, Queen David Gilmour - Pink Floyd Ian Gillam - Deep Purple Tony Iommi - Black Sabbath Joe Perry - Aerosmith Neil Young, Joe Satriani, Steve Morse, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Yngwie Malmsteen, Sammy Hagar, Joe Walsh, David Lee Roth, Bruce Springsteen. Many more, including band associates of the above. The big distinctions are: They played actual Rock Music. And these guys either played their own instruments or sang in bands that did that. Look, Kayne may be one of the best in his actual musuc genre. He might be a \u201crock star\u201d (in quotes), but he\u2019s no Rock Star in the strict sense of the term. ",
