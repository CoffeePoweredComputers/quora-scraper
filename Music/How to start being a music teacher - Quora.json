            "answer_text": "Typically, you have to spend 4\u20135 in an undergraduate program studying music and education including a student teaching. To get into these programs you have to audition and be accepted on a specialty instrument or voice. Depending on your state requirements, you may also have to take a basic skills test and/or a competency test in music. However, you also have two other alternatives in most states. These provide ways to get certified without having an undergrad degree. Take an accelerated program and test (this is for those already with a degree in education).Take a test and have hours of experience. Most states allow schools to appoint a classroom teacher in a music position if they can\u2019t hire a certified one right away. For those with enough hours of experience, some states will let you just take the test.Learn more about what a music degree involves: https://dynamicmusicroom.com/music-education-degree-length/ ",
