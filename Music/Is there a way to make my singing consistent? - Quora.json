            "answer_text": "The things you need for consistency: proper techniquehealth (overall health, vocal health, proper body posture)proper warm upregular practice to build and maintain correct techniqueknowing your limitsYour diaphragm is an involuntary muscle.  If you are \"feeling it is stuck,\" then either your breath support is lacking, or else you are creating tension in your throat, maybe by lifting your larynx, maybe from tensing your head and neck.  Unless you are doing specific head voice/vibrato training, your head and neck should be straight Volume comes from efficient, controlled airflow.  You need good breath support and controlled output in order to produce volume and sing longer phrases, hold longer notes. Your vocal instrument needs conscientious care.  Rest when you need it, don't strain, aim for quality of voice and not volume.  The resonant sound you can produce with correct technique is much better than shouting for your voice. If you have congestion and phlegm, warm water and rest, and control of any allergies, will help.  Not warming up risks damaging your voice.  It's like chewing a piece of gum to blow a bubble.  To get it stretchy, it takes time, you can't blow a bubble while it's still a sugary block, you have to dissolve some sugar and get it ready to stretch.  If you try to blow a bubble before you've chewed enough, the sugar (or sugar substitute) is grainy and will pop your bubble.  Smooth, steady air from good breath support, plus stretchy, warmed up and ready-to-go vocal cords, will yield a better and healthier sound. ",

            "answer_text": "In my experience, most inconsistent singing comes from poor breathe control. You want your vocal cords to be vibrating at a consistent rate, in order to do this air must be flowing through the vocal tract at a condistent. You will be much more successful at this if you are breathing from the lower abdominal muscles, because you can contract them slower and more smoothly than your rib cage. Aim for a slow steady contraction as you use the air. A few other things that can affect sound consistency: vowel placement, space in the vocal tract and your use of resonating chambers in the body. As I always say to students- the goal is to sound consistent but your approach (whether you are higher or lower, which vowel you are singing on) should not be. For instance forward resonance is much more important in the lower part of the register and space is more important at the top. Thus is because the sound tends to fall backward and become unfocused as you get lower in your range, so you will want to think about sending it forward into your cheekbones and bridge of your nose. In your high notes though, the vocal tract will need space for the vocal cords to stretch and expand, which is what happens as you sing higher notes. Finally, make sure your soft palate is lifted and nasal port is closed all the time. To experience this, simply yawn and feel the space created in the back of your throat. ",
