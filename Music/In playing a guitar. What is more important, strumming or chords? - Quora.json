            "answer_text": "I'm not sure about the exact nature of the question, but I'll try answering from myu learning experiences.When I started learning the instrument , I started of with simple notes, finger exercises, drills for right hand-left hand co-ordination etc. After a while I was introduced into the world of chords. And Oh boy, weren't they difficult- it seemed as if my fingers had a will of their own, and extra unwanted chunks of flesh hanging out at the wrong places- thus sticking on to strings that I didn't want them to.But then I persisted, and they came round one-by-one- C, G, Am, E, D - the easy ones were ok. But I couldn't get my head around strumming- becuse my right hand felt odd when I tried to go up- the upstroke.I am not sure how or when, but at one point I somehow became comfortable with the upstroke- I think I forgot the fact that I was making a horrible sound and just went along with it, and it gradually became better. Anyhow, end result being I could do DU DU DU DU for a whole bar. Now after all this, when I started playing songs I realised that you needn't know every single chord in the book to play. To be honest with C Am G E D- the easy ones I mentioned you can play a lot of songs- of course you have to get the timing right , and shift between chords comfortably- as far as strumming is concerned- you will learn it naturally- just listen to the song and try making the sound with you mouth first (sounds weird, but works) and then try it on the Guitar- slowly at first and then learn to do it at the speed of the record. Try different combinations of the up, down stroke and dummy strokes etc. Eventually you'll get the right thing. TL;DR - Learn to play the chords clearly, and shift between them smoothly- strumming and rhythm will come on it's own, needn't worry much.

            "answer_text": "They are both of equal importance. It is important that the chord that you play clearly voices each of the notes you hold down on the fretboard. That there is no jarring or buzzing is important.  On the other hand a good rhythm or strumming pattern can totally put the vibe into the song than just simple DDDD or DUDUDUDU or even DDUUDU. Listen to Trains by Porcupine tree, listen to More than words by extreme. Certain techniques in your right hand are essential to be a good rhythm player. 1. D and U strum sound exactly same, 2. D and U sound different, 3. Palm mute, 4. Bass note in the rhythm as in B DU UBU kind of rhtyhms, 5. Syncopation, 6. Proper use of rests, 7. Good arpeggios and 8. for more complicated situations being able to play rhythm in any time signature, be it 4, 3 or 6 or 7 or 5 or whatever. The best way to do that is learn rhythm for popular songs. Beatles and Pink Floyd worked for me. Also to learn a rhythm one must be able to count the beats while playing. So if you are playing a song that's in 5/4 you can maybe count 1.2.3.1.2.1.2.3.1.2.1.2.3.1.2 and so on.  Hope this helps :) ",
