            "answer_text": "Andy is the redeemer, Red is the redeemed. Both play a part in defining the title\u2019s \u201cRedemption\u201d. \u201cHope? Let me tell you something, my friend. Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane. It's got no use on the inside. You'd better get used to that idea.\u201d The movie poster features the iconic image of Andy basking in the rain after he escapes Shawshank. It\u2019s easy to be lulled into thinking that the \u201cRedemption\u201d in the title refers solely to Andy\u2019s story - his wrongful conviction, his struggle in prison and ultimately his escape from Shawshank. The story is all about Red. He is the central character and the film\u2019s narrator. He is the one who gets redeemed and he is narrating the story of his redemption as well as Andy\u2019s role as his redeemer to us the audience. The film is Red narrating his \u201cShawshank Redemption\u201d after he gets reunited with Andy in Zihuatanejo. He is now completely partial to the whole story i.e. Red knows the details of how Andy escaped, about his assuming the identity of Randall Stephens, his role in exposing the Wardens corruption etc. If an innocent Andy was never incarcerated then in all likelihood Red would presumably have met the same fate as their mutual friend Brooks Hatlen. Mid-way through the film there is a key foreshadowing sequence featuring Brooks. He is an elderly in-mate who has been released, nay thrown, back into society after a half-century stretch at Shawshank. Shortly after his release get\u2019s approved, Brooks, a quiet, learned man, becomes uncharacteristically and shockingly violent and aggressive to a group of his fellow well-wishing inmates. They are bemused. He is getting out of prison so shouldn't he be happy about that? Why is he threatening to cut his friend\u2019s throat? He was a peripheral character, but for Red, Brooks was a friend and his fate in the story is important. Brooks like Red was also convicted for murder and in the event of their release, they would be perpetually monitored by the Parole Board. They can never, as such, be truly free. Their crime will shadow them for the rest of their lives. Unlike Red, Brooks has no one to redeem him. He doesn\u2019t know anybody outside of Shawshank. As an institutionalized man, Brooks finds that he is incapable of integrating back into a now fast paced society and he decides \u201cnot to stay\u201d. Feeling completely hopeless, he commits suicide in lieu of engaging in a crime spree which would result in his re-incarceration. Ironically, in deciding not to rob and murder again (he fantasizes about robbing his workplace and shooting his belittling manager) we can see that Brooks is completely rehabilitated yet his soul destroying, fear-inducing tenure in Shawshank renders that actual rehabilitation irrelevant. His violent reaction to his eventual parole is no longer shocking as it was testament to a powerful emotion; fear. Quite simply, Brooks was afraid. He threatened to murder Heywood expressly to stay in prison - \u201cIt\u2019s the only way they\u2019ll let me stay\u201d he weeps but ,with Andy\u2019s help, he regains his rationality and just breaks down in tears at the seemingly futile nature of his position. The other younger in-mates don\u2019t fully comprehend what happened at the time and the scene where Red explains the nature of being institutionalized to the group makes us aware that Red is smart enough to not only quickly grasp Brooks\u2019 conflicted mindset but that he implcitly understands that his own situation and mutual fate is in parallel with that of Brooks i.e. if and when he get\u2019s paroled in future, he will likely meet the same fate too. For Red, there is no point to the concept of rehabilitation as being incarcerated for so long just takes your life away. \u201c\u2026they send you here for life, and that\u2019s exactly what they take\u2026.\u201d For Brooks, after his release, it was a physical loss of life whereas for Red it is a metaphorical loss and so long as he can stay in prison he will die, unafraid, in Shawshank. The tragic irony of his story is that he would rather be in prison than be \u201cfree\u201d. Freedom to Red means death. He implicitly knows he will be useless on the outside. He knowingly states during the course of the film that \u201c\u2026every man has his breaking point\u201d. That is Red\u2019s destiny. He is institutionalized and, with resignation, he consigns himself to acceptance of his situation and what it will mean for him in the event of his release. As the in-mates listen to Andy reading Brooks\u2019 suicide note, we see that dismayed acceptance written all over Red\u2019s face. He quietly says, as if almost to himself, that Brooks \u201c..should have died in here\u201d. In the aftermath of Brooks\u2019 death, that is now what Red wants for himself. His hope is gone. Brooks\u2019 suicide serves as a frightening validation for what Red long feared might happen to him too. If he get\u2019s released he\u2019ll be living in fear. He rails against \u201cdangerous\u201d hope. Not long after Brooks\u2019 suicide, he openly berates Andy for eulogizing about hope. The two fast friends become ideologically estranged because Andy is firmly resolute that hope is good whereas Red is defiantly belligerent against the futility of believing in hope. Red knows he won\u2019t be able to make it in society. His rationale is that outside of Shawshank he has no value or purpose so what good is hope to him? His only \u201chope\u201d is to stay in jail, retain his sense of worth and it\u2019s that dichotomy which fuels his belligerence, which estranges him from Andy and it troubles him deeply. After all, who in their right mind wants to remain imprisoned? The eager desire for release which he expressed in past milestone parole hearings is gone. Red, now an elderly man, goes on to give a deliberately scathing assessment at his 40-year parole hearing about rehabilitation in contrast to those earlier hearings. He makes a stern point, particularly taking the fate of his friend Brooks into account, that rehabilitation is \u201cbullshit\u201d and rebukes how nonsensical the idea of it actually is when applied to a man in his position i.e. an old man, now rendered useless to society, scared witless and certainly not \u201cready to rejoin society\u201d as the Board officially defines it. His point is that he is rehabilitated, he regrets his crime every day but it\u2019s all irrelevant now. His indifferent \u201cstamp your form sonny, stop wasting my time\u201d attitude backfires on him and his blunt and raw self-knowing honesty sways the parole board leading to his release finally getting approved. It\u2019s a nice moment for the audience, the lead character get\u2019s out, we\u2019re happy for him but the precedent set by Brooks\u2019 suicide sequence earlier quickly overshadows that third act. We see him following the same established routine a convicted murderer like Brooks went through. He nervously says farewell to the empathetic prison guards at the gates, he rides the bus with abject anxiety, he stays in the same dingy motel, he has the same mind-numbing job and it is strongly implied that he will meet the same fate. Darabonts direction and the beautifully melancholic score skillfully lulls us into thinking a hopeless Red, our protagonist, will kill himself in a similar fit of despair as his old friend Brooks. We're shown him forlornly perusing a row of hand guns in a Pawn shop window display until he says; \u201cOnly one thing stops me. A promise I made to Andy\u201d Red opens up the compass he was actually looking at in that window. Red, unlike Brooks, had a savior. The seed of his redemption is established through his long term bond with his friend Andy. In an earlier scene, on the day of Andy\u2019s planned prison break, Red deems the ever-optimistic Andy to have lost his hope as well particularly after his chance of release is scuppered following Tommy\u2019s murder by the scheming, corrupt Warden as well as a torturous two month stint in solitary confinement. Andy\u2019s chance of getting out seemingly died with Tommy whose potential testimony on Andy\u2019s behalf could have gotten him a retrial. That pivotal scene, where they sit in the prison yard, is where Andy, secretly knowing he plans to escape, conveys a veiled message to his hopeless friend with cryptic talk of a town in Mexico. Red compassionately berates him for thinking about \u201cshitty pipe dreams\u201d, he attempts to be rational to Andy about the reality of their mutually hopeless situation i.e.\u201dMexico is way the hell down there and you're in here, and that's the way it is.\u201d He misinterprets Andy\u2019s attitude as dangerously deluded when Andy cryptically says it comes down to a simple choice. Get busy living\u2026or get busy dying. In the aftermath, Red now conveys his worry that Andy, bereft of all hope, plans to kill himself, that his friend has reached his own personal \u201cbreaking point\u201d. However, his savior performs an escape which the Warden calls a miracle as Andy escapes Shawshank through, funnily enough, a shitty pipe. Andy, the day of his planned escape, knew Red\u2019s character and temperament. That scene in the prison yard is the central one in the movie. They both sat with their backs, idiomatically, against the prison wall. When they part, they remain ideologically opposed but Andy, before his escape attempt, sensing that Red will likely get released at some point subtly dissuades his friend from following the same fate which Red has resigned himself to and to which their mutual friend Brooks succumbed. He didn\u2019t have to say anything but he actively seeks to redeem Red. It is ultimately up to Red to seek redemption. Andy, deliberately feigning resignation, asks Red to do him a favor during that meeting. He asks that, years from now, if he ever get\u2019s paroled, that he will find something he wants him to have. Something is buried in Buxton under a beautiful Oak tree. They part ways after explicit instructions are given by Andy who goes on to escape that same night. Red remains in prison. He misses his friend. He reminisces about him with his buddies and, in one symbolic scene, he mourns the loss of their friendship as Red tends to a graveyard headstone. His bond with Andy was deep. He still retains his fears about life on the outside but after his surprise parole Red resolves to follow his previous instructions from the central scene. Those fears of life outside are validated but he has something to live for. A promise he wishes to fulfil. He goes and finds the box Andy alluded to. Thanks to Andy\u2019s help, Red has chosen to be optimistic and hopeful again. He does not end up like Brooks in the aftermath of his release. He gets redeemed. The box itself, buried in the ground, serves as a metaphor for Red\u2019s hope. It was lost, buried but all he needed was some guidance to find it again. Red seeks, finds and regains his hope. \u201cThere\u2019s something buried there that I want you to have\". That \u201csomething\" was the hope Andy wanted his friend to recover, his wish for his friend to get busy living. Andy explicitly reminds him of that in his note. \u201cRemember Red, Hope is a good thing, maybe even the best of things and no good thing ever dies.\u201d Red doesn\u2019t die, he recovers his hope. Andy saves his life, Red does get busy living, he remembers the name of the town, he goes to meet up with his friend \u201cway the hell down there\u201d, he is a man who \u201cknows how to get things\u201d and the Pacific is as blue as he hoped it would be in his prison dreams. He concludes his narration about his Shawshank Redemption with a simple and eloquent \u201c\u2026I hope\u201d  Get busy livin\u2019 or get busy dyin\u2019. That\u2019s goddamn right. ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone knows that the movie Shawshank Redemption is based on a short story by King name Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption. The title itself has 3 parts Rita Hayworth: movie star and incredible person. Shawshank: an imaginary prison in Maine Redemption: meaning \u2018redemption\u2019. So immediately 3 questions arise. What is Shawshank? How does it redeem people ? And finally what\u2019s Rita Hayworth got to do with it? As you go into the story you realize that the story is based in the times of Rita Hayworth. It\u2019s about a banker, Andy who faced injustice and was sent to the Shawshank Prison for years. The book or rather the movie ends with Andy escaping the prison and stays as a free person. The redemption here mostly tells about Andy redeeming the injustice he faced. He found ways to inspire himself when in prison. He faced rapists in the prison. He filed taxes for free. He laundered money of the Warden. He helped to upgrade the prison library. He started other prisoners get formal education and at least a school degree. All these activities gave him the energy he needed to redeem the injustice ",
