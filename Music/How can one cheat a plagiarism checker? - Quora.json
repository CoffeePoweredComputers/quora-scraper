            "answer_text": "Two ways: Method 1-(Usual method) STEP 1 - Open the word doc for which you want to check plagiarism. STEP 2- Replace the words with the its synonyms (replace at least two words in a sentence) like:  STEP 3- Replace unsolicited(say) with its synonym by right clicking it and then :  similarly replace maximum words to bypass plagiarism. Method 2-(easy and less time consuming) Basically, we will be replacing the blank spaces with the hidden alpha-numeric value whose font will be white in color to by pass plagiarism. STEP 1- Open the word doc for which you want to check plagiarism. Now go to Replace option:  STEP 2- Find and Replace option will pop-up  STEP 3- Go to More option:  STEP 4- Now in the find what- type \u201c ^w \u201c (regular expression for blank spaces) and in the replace with- type \u201c i \u201c(or any of the alpha-numeric value) STEP 5- then go to format >> font (as done below)  STEP 6- Replace font color to White  STEP 7- Select Replace All option  Other powerful way is to use Blank symbol (from Character Map) instead of alphanumeric value (it may be not plagiarize 100% but is more efficient and less likely to be caught mainly by paid software). You may further need to use Method 1 to get 100% unique content. To find Blank symbol, follow steps bellow:   Now check for plagiarism using any online available tool, it will be 100% unique (most probably). Hope it helped. Thank you!!\u263a\u263b ",

Here are some tricks.. To replace words in the documents with other words of the same meaning as the plagiarism checker matches words so it can detect if the synonyms are used.What you can do is replace all the spaces with some foregin character and later use 'Find and replace' to make all those characters font color white so they appear as spaces. So the software will treat the whole document as a single word and will find no match with any other doc..Sources: https://www.prescottpapers.com/blog/cheating/how-to-cheat-turnitin.php ",
