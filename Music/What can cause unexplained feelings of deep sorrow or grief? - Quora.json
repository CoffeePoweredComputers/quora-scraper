            "answer_text": "Sometimes the things we watch and listen to affect us more than we realize. This could be movies, music, or even conversations we overhear, places we\u2019ve been and especially the people we spend time with. Sometimes we talk to someone very negative and agree with everything they say to be polite and walk away feeling rotten. Be careful of the people you spend time with and the things you agree with. And don\u2019t overload on the crime shows and sad music. Like I said sometimes these can be things we don\u2019t even notice we are around like if you are in a public place with very negative energy for many hours. You may think you are blocking it out but you are still there. It\u2019s like when you feel tired from traveling. You have been sitting the whole time yet it still wears on you because you came a long way. You passed through many different atmospheres. That takes energy to endure. And you do it without thinking but when you arrive you are exhausted. You may be sitting in a train station for a while or traveling down town for several hours and see some unsightly things consciously and unconsciously and not think it will affect you because you ignore it or block it out or forget about it but it still can affect you. Bottom line is sometimes things affect us more than we realize or want to admit. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t have that anymore luckily and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s common. I\u2019ve had it at my worst times. I\u2019ve had months when I had really, really bad depression (and battling bulimia at that time). I actually thought couldn\u2019t live any longer and should and would die. The intense feeling could be that things are getting worse or better. Maybe you\u2019re hitting rock bottom and ready to get better (not saying that you aren\u2019t now!). I think therapy or self-helps books would be a good starting point. In my case both have helped me tremendously. Try to see if you can live through this grief/pain and feel everything without trying to stop the feelings. Write down what you felt after or during. If it gets too much try coping mechanisms (there are a lot on the internet). (I usually didn\u2019t do anything, but now I call my best friends if they have time and it usually helps me.) Write down every thought and how those thoughts came to be. See if you can pinpoint something. There doesn\u2019t have to be anything to pinpoint or that you need to find, but it can help you 1. know more about what you\u2019re experiencing personally and 2. maybe help you deal with it better. It will go away, but it can come back from time to time. I think this grief is a symptom of depression and not the main point you should focus on when battling it, but definitely something you can try to deal with in a healthy, helpful way. Hope this helps a bit. ",
