            "answer_text": "This is actually a pretty deep question \u2013 and it can\u2019t really be answered properly with a mere \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d If the rap is genuinely \u201cChristian\u201d in its message, and if you\u2019re a Christian, then I suspect you aren\u2019t really that concerned about the lyrics. It sounds like you\u2019re concerned about the music style itself. If this is the case, you should begin seeking answers to this question by asking yourself what kinds of emotions rap music communicates to listeners. Unfortunately, the rap didn\u2019t exist when the Bible was written, so there isn\u2019t a verse that addresses your specific question. But if you can determine what emotions the rap genre typically communicates, you can determine if those emotions are appropriate for Christians. For instance, if some rap carries an angry tone, and you know that the Bible teaches us to be \u201cslow to wrath (James 1:19)\u201d than we probably should limit our exposure to that rap. The truth is that rap music often does communicate anger (a simple google search of \u201cis rap angry?\u201d will yield tons of hits). For this reason, among others, I stay clear of rap music as a genre. But you\u2019ll have to come to your own decision. Just submit yourself wholly to Christ, study the scripture, think and pray about it, and do what you believe to be the right thing. Hope this helps! ",
