            "answer_text": "Jamendo is the answer you're looking for. Jamendo has a database of some 400K songs, all licensed under a Creative Commons license. There are many you can buy for commercial purposes and many others that you don't even need to buy, as the author chose to release them without any limitation except Attribution. The drawback is that quite obviously you won't find any famous/commercial song there., but I'm sure you'll find something that fits your needs. ",
