            "answer_text": "Edit: Before reading the answer, please read the end so I can justify myself! Do you even have to ask this? Shawn Mendes is obviously a lot more hotter than Harry Styles. I mean have you even seen him? There's no way the two can compare. Shawn is the hotter one. He's the cutest guy ever! Just look at his lazy brown eyes or his cute messy hair. Tell me that he isn't cuter than Harry. Everything about him is absolutely perfect. Everything from his scar on the cheek to his amazing smile or his voice. He is the epitome of cuteness! Do you see how cute and innocent he is! He is the hottest celebrity I know! Trust me, Harry Styles doesn't compare to him. No one compares to Shawn Mendes. Not now, not ever. Shawn Mendes. Shawn Mendes. Shawn      Do you see this!!!! Edit: Published on August 19th 2019. Currently it's 7th July, 2020. It's been my first and only answer for a long time. You have to understand that's the only reason I haven't deleted this sh*t. The only reason! God, I I wish I wasn't so sentimental! That's right. No giving the other person any chance. Just forcing my opinion on others. Fan girling over Shawn Mendes. And starting my journey on Quora. Thanks for reading. The edit, not the answer. Also, @Archa Bajpai? You are completely right. I was being defensive and entitled. But trust me I've changed. You're completely right. WHY DOES THIS HAVE SO MANY VIEWS??? ",

            "answer_text": "Ugh, in terms of things like this, I really am inclined to discuss more. Harry is such a babe. If you look at the way he talks, he put his words into his music, the tune, the rhythm, the vibes, you find yourself a very romantic sweet gentleman. Then you look to his face, green eye sparkling, his eye bags are quite attractive um. His nose that very sharp, his dimples, his smile, his neat teeth. Everything that is on his face is extremely perfect. His tall features with tattoos all over. His very sexy hand with rings and tattoos. Not to mention, the fashion he expresses. He is super duper hot. Shawn. If you knew magcon, then you would love him even more. He has always been the kindest, the sweetest, the innocent who only wants to make other people happy. He loves music and cheering people up. He is basically not a type of guy who likes to break people\u2019s heart. No need to talk about his features. He is perfect from head to toe. I can not vote guys, both are such a hottie. But if I have to choose, I would go for Harry. He is very funny, kind, and gentle. Love them both. ",
