Listen, there are no hard-and-fast rules for how long the clip should be, the shorter the better, one second, two seconds, ten seconds, or even thirty seconds it can all work, just make sure to follow the tips that I\u00b4m going to discuss later on and you\u00b4ll be safe.Transform it. You HAVE TO transform copyrighted work in order to qualify under fair use guidelines. Whenever you use someone else\u00b4s video clip just add some comments on top, use your own audio clip, or use it as a tiny clip within a larger whole made of different video clips from various sources.Out of context. As long as you change a video clip original meaning and use it to your own advantage, whatever that maybe, you\u00b4ll be transforming it and therefore you shouldn\u00b4t be allowed to get a YouTube copyright strike.Change it! Similar to transform but with the difference that you\u00b4ll modify the original clip by making a remix, a mash-up, or any sort of new expression of the copyrighted art that works as a totally new creation. A good example of this would be The Shape Of Sickness, which is a mash-up between Ed Sheeran and Disturbed.Attribution. A decent defense against a YouTube copyright strike, when used in combination with some of the other tips that I\u00b4ve talked about and many others that I\u00b4m about to, is simply citing to the original work in your description.To Learn more you can visit this article here: create and edit documents online, for free.",
