            "answer_text": "He DIDN'T!Honestly. Sometimes we look for hidden meanings and analogies when there simply aren't any. Here's how it figures in the song\"The King is gone but he's not forgotten\"(Elvis was dubbed \"The King\" by his fans & the Press - - just check Don MacLean's \"American Pie\" if you want to be sure).But I digress:It's a nice lyric because it's really a song about the DOWNSIDE of Rock music as much as it is about the upside. It's about soaring to stardom, and then ( usually), disappearing. It all happens much too fast, but to Neil, it's still worth it. It's all worth the pain, hassles, lying, backstabbing, and bad times, because for a short period of time, it's also exhilarating and emotionally fulfilling. At its best, it can be transcendent.Then the next sentence he has to find a word to lyrically match \"forgotten\". There are only 26 letters in the alphabet, which will work best AND, lyrically and still make sense?So you start with \"A\" & work your way up the alphabet: \"Botton\"? Nope, makes no sense. \"Cotton\"? Nope again, same reason. \"Gotten\"? And a third time.Both are actual words & both rhyme but neither makes sense in the context of the song, which means that Neil would have now change the line about Elvis to something else, but it's a good lyric he doesn't want to alter. So Neil just kept going until he hit the letter \"R\". \"Rotten\". Hey, \"Johnny ROTTEN\" from the Sex Pistols! That would work!\"The King is gone but he's not forgotten, this is the story of Johnny Rotten\"Yes! That works great!Well, it's obviously NOT a song about the Sex Pistol's \"Johnny Rotten\" (really one \"John Lydon) but it doesn't matter. It's clever and if it doesn't actually mesh with all the other lyrics, who cares? It'll grab everyone's attention anyway and get them thinking and like Elvis. So there's your answer. It's not the best or the strongest line in the whole song, but it was enough to complete the thought and it a lyrical bridge which brings Neil to the next verse (and gets a bit of a rise from his audience in the live version) which is the heart of his message he wants to tell us:\"It's better to burn out, than it is to rust\" And that pretty much encapsulates Young's feelings towards stardom which he'd experienced and been such a large part of from such a young age, and for so long. Now, having left two \"super groups\" Buffalo Springfield & CSN&Y, he's looking backwards on his life of musical stardom and reflecting and evaluating it, and telling us what he thinks about it.And basically he's saying that with all it's sore points, it's still better to have had even one bright shining moment in the sun, and then burn out as an incandescent star, than it is to plod along as an old musical \"has-been\", to metaphorically \"rust\" away. It's better to have loved and lost, than never have loved at all. It's better to have come out of nowhere, \"Out of the Blue\" - - -(financially \"into the Black\" is a term which means \"profitability in the Finance & Banking industries for ages - being \"in the Red\" is the opposite, you're losing money - - - Neil was part of two profitable music groups)- - - to come from zero and make something of yourself, even if you disappear in an instant. It's better to leave the stage that way, then it is to grow old and become a musical \"has been\", Better to burn out than to watch as you age and see your creativity diminish and limp along in your later years, like a piece of metal that's turned to \"rust\". So those are my thoughts, and then some, on why he chose those lyrics.The song is NOT about Johnny Rotten, it's about choices; between risking and possibly succeeding, even if you're suddenly being dumped, by the public, by the record company two years later. Almost Hamlet-like, he's asking \"To be or not to be?\", That's the question that he's posing to us.Is it worth it? And Neil Young has given us his definite and affirmative answer in this song.Hope this helps! - - - DJ ",

            "answer_text": "This is an alternate version of Young's song \"My My, Hey Hey (Out Of The Blue),\" which also appears on the Rust Never Sleeps album. The lyrics are slightly different, and \"Hey Hey, My My\" is electric, while \"My My, Hey Hey,\" is acoustic.Young recorded this with the band Crazy Horse. It was the first time Young recorded with them since Zuma in 1975.In the biography of Neil Young, Shakey by Jimmy McDonough, Neil points out that this song came about when he was jamming with the band Devo. The phrase \"rust never sleeps\" was uttered by Mark Mothersbaugh, and Neil, loving the impromptu line, acquired it. >>The lyrics refer to \"The King\" and Johnny Rotten as rockers whose legacies live on. The King is Elvis Presley, and Johnny Rotten was the lead singer of The Sex Pistols.In The Complete Guide to the Music of Neil Young, Young explains why the line \"rust never sleeps\" appealed to him. \"It relates to my career; the longer I keep on going the more I have to fight this corrosion. And now that's gotten to be like the World Series for me. The competition's there, whether I will corrode and eventually not be able to move anymore and just repeat myself until further notice or whether I will be able to expand and keep the corrosion down a little.\"This is the last song on the electric side of Rust Never Sleeps. The first side (first five songs on the CD) are acoustic.The song has become a standby of Young's live performances, being played at nearly every live show throughout his career, often as a closing song.John Lennon expressed his disagreement with the \"burn out or fade away\" sentiment in a 1980 interview with Playboy: \"I hate it. It's better to fade away like an old soldier than to burn out. If he was talking about burning out like Sid Vicious, forget it. I don't appreciate the worship of dead Sid Vicious or of dead James Dean or dead John Wayne. It's the same thing. Making Sid Vicious a hero, Jim Morrison - it's garbage to me. I worship the people who survive.\" Young responded to the quote, saying that he was describing the paradoxical nature of the rock-and-roll lifestyle, not advocating it.This was included on Live Rust, a concert album and video featuring Young playing against a backdrop of comically enormous amps and microphones.",
