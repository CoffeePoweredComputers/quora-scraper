            "answer_text": "Is Michael Jackson famous in Asia? Well Asia's a big old continent - a straw poll of my immediate family in Thailand, which is 5 people, have never heard of him, my eldest daughter replied with \u201c is he the that pedo\u201d? But she couldn't name one song or name his nationality. And I'd guess that's true for most of Thailand. During Gulf war 2, planes flew from near my home. We went out to eat with some friends as this plane screamed over our heads, my friends Thai wife, who held an MA in pharmacy and was a 30+ something PHD student, said \u201c yes Sadam Hussein, he's a very good boxer from Chiang Mai\u201d. And she was correct, but the Wests bogey man sharing his name and indeed Gulf war one itself had completely passed this educated, multi lingual and by no means stupid woman bye. And the Beatles. JFK, Remembrance Sunday, Stalin, and a 1001 other cultural memes that 99.99% of \u2018westerners' would recognise as important have no meaning in much and probably most of Asia. Europeans are obsessed by America, there's not much more thought of the US here than Brits give to Iceland. And of Europe there's as much reflection as there is on Mars. ",
