Be aware though, if they know you \u2018can\u2019t dance\u2019 then they will drill you on it and give you hell about it until you can. You\u2019ll need to work extra hours outside of dance class working on improving your dance all the while making sure your vocals are still there. If you still can\u2019t dance by the time evaluations come, unless you have a god-like singing voice that makes up for your lack of dance (or they see potential to have you as a kind of IU type solo idol that doesn\u2019t do hard dances), you\u2019ll be cut.

            "answer_text": "The other answers said it all but I like to add that it depends on what company you audition for like SM doesn't care if you have a nice voice you're in their motto is we can build talent and they've proven it. A lot of SM artists couldn't dance when they auditioned but with training became some of the best, take Taeyong from NCT for example he was awful at dancing to the point that the SM dance coach told him he's hopeless and should give up but he powered through and now he's one if the best dancers in kpop praised by other idols ,dance trainers and choreographers, but you should keep in mind that it won't be an easy road at all.
