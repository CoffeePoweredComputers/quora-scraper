            "answer_text": "So can you go to a k-pop audition and dance a girl group dance as a male? Of course you can. But is your goal in joining an audition to get accepted and become a star? That choice might be a little off. Companies\u2019 goal for an audition is to look for new and suitable talents for the said feild. If you dance a girl group dance then there are 2 possible outcomes: They will probably think that you are just some fanboy and you joined because you are fan and it is not really your passion (since the people will really judge you). Some companies aim for excellent performances so disappointment is really prone since there is a big difference between the actions and moves in guy and girl group dances.The judges might see a potential in you despite of those girly dances then you will pass. Talent managers have those intuition and eyes for talents that they think is suitable for their companies and has the great spirit for them to train and mold. If you have those then that would be great.But even so, we will never know what will really happen or what is going on with the judges minds. If you really want then why not? You will know when you get there so good luck to you and FIGHTING!! ",

            "answer_text": "Yea if it was K-pop golden era 2010 or 2011. These days Ceo and auditions managers will be very blunt and give you a second chance but put a male track on you didn\u2019t even practice for on for you to dance to on the spot. Kpop trends change quickly so you wouldn\u2019t be able to get in like sungjong of infinite did with girlgroup dances. If I were you try to find easy male group dances like audition with The boygroup astro songs they are really easy to follow ",
