            "answer_text": "Almost all people can sing well with proper training. The reason not everyone does sing well is because most people do not have proper training, and not everyone has a natural talent for singing. Take me, for example. I am a music education student in the US, and I am a terrible singer. However, an important part of my curriculum is based on singing. Besides my regular ensemble requirements on my primary instrument, I will also be required to perform in a choir for at least one semester. In addition, I will take four semesters of an ear training class, that also works elements of vocal control. I am near the end of my first semester of this course, and I still, by all criteria, am an awful singer. However, I am much better than I was 11 weeks ago. And I will only continue to improve. I will never be an outstanding vocalist, but that is in part because I will not be taking dedicated vocal lessons for any significant portion of my life. Now, although almost anyone can learn to sing well, not all of these people have naturally good instruments. Most people don't associate the term \u201cinstrument\u201d with vocalists, but the truth is that vocalists do have instrument; they just happen to be their voices. Not everyone has a naturally good instrument. Someone could learn all the necessary vocal and Aural Skills and techniques to be a great singer, but if their voice isn't pleasant to listen to, they're unlikely to be the next vocal star. Now, I did say \u201calmost\u201d at the beginning. There are a small number of individuals who are actually tone-deaf, but this is extremely rare. People who are truly tone-deaf cannot differentiate between two pitches at all, and it is a real medical condition. Most people who claim to be tone-deaf are actually just unskilled at hearing pitches (as I am), and can be trained to do so more accurately. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two possible reasons why not everyone sings decently at the very least, which include as follows:  Not being musically inclined instead of being 'pitch-deaf'. Sadly, nowadays people use the term 'pitch-deaf' very often, discouraging others from unlocking their musical potential in the process. Clinical pitch-deafness is extremely rare, and most extreme out-of-tune issues (e.g. singing the wrong pitches or in the wrong key and not realizing it) are due to a lack of musical exposure. Giving yourself some effort on music (e.g. going for vocal coaching or karaoke sessions with friends, learning an instrument, exposing yourself to a little music theory, etc) can really improve your pitch recognition and ultimately the ability to sing better. Some might be faster at it, but just like skateboarding, dancing, or other existing skills anyone can have, singing can be improved if one continues to train and improve himself or herself within that field. So next time, if someone tells you that you are 'pitch-deaf', you are not if you can at the very least tell if your friend or yourself is singing out of tune.  Having extremely cruel experiences with singing when they were younger.This is often found in people who have very discouraging music teachers or expose themselves to extremely critical individuals back when they were younger. As a result, they lack the confidence to unlock the potential in their voices, subsequently believing that they are not musically talented although they might be. ",
