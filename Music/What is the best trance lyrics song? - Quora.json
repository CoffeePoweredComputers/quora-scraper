            "answer_text": "Some people would also call this Vocal Trance, but I completely understand the question. On this one, two stand out (and that's saying something because unlike the purist trance snobs who snicker at it whilst preaching the falsehood that vocal trance somehow is a pop selfout, I love this subgenre). First, Ive got to go with the simple, poignant, reassuring lyrics of enduring commitment, protection, and devotion that come from Giuseppe Ottaviani's I Am Your Shadow. The breakdown has never NOT brought chills to my spine and tears to my eyes, and I've heard it dozens of times\u2026 and you'll almost never see tears in my eyes otherwise. . I Am Your Shadow I am yours; Eternally Tied to all of your tomorrows. I\u2019ll never let go. I watch you sleep. I watch you dream. Every step you take I\u2019ll follow. I am your shadow. I\u2019ll be your light To the end of time. Just so you know: I\u2019ll never let go. When you can\u2019t hide In the darkened night, Just so you know: I\u2019ll never let go. You are not alone. Every night I\u2019ll keep you safe from all you fear. You are not alone. Every time you look around you\u2019ll find me near. You are not alone in this world anymore. You are not alone in this world anymore. I am your shadow. I am your shadow. .  \u2026\u2026 On the flip side of that is the angry anthem from the collective known as Dash Berlin in their track Man On The Run: . Man On The Run You stole a kiss and stole my heart.Made me a fool right from the start.Wouldn't have been so bad, exceptThis little plan-it fell apart. If I were you,I'd dare not speak;I'd run like hellIn hopes of seeing tomorrow. It's such a travesty,The way you say our love should be.Yeah, such a tragedy.Think you can just break my heart and leave me?Well, you better run now,Man on the run.Playing for fun.Wind me up.Leave me undone. These lips are sealed, I'll never speakYour name in loving memory.So don't you try to make amends.That's what you get for playing me. If I were you,I'd dare not speak;I'd run like hellIn hopes of seeing tomorrow. Break my heart and leave me now.Man on the run. It's such a travesty,The way you say our love should be.Yeah, such a tragedy.Think you can just break my heart and leave me?Well, you better run now,Man on the run.Playing for fun.Wind me up.Leave me undone. . . The piano and crescendoing supersaws leading to the sidechained hook of the song coupled with the unforgettable \u201cIf I were you, I'd dare not speak; I'd run like hell in hopes of seeing tomorrow.\u201d lyrics guarantees the timeless legacy of this innovative track!  Make music. Do it with love . \u2026 and vice versa. ",
