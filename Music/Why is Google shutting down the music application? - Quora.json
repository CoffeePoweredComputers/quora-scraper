            "answer_text": "Google Music had a good run, but it was not a match with Spotify or Apple Music. Why? Better UI - It matters a lot to users who use their music app religiously for a longer period of time. User-friendly and intuitiveness is the key.Music Recommendations/Discovery - Spotify\u2019s single greatest selling point has been its extraordinary music discovery and recommendations. It is better than Apple and definitely miles ahead of Google Music.Introduction of YouTube Music - While Google Music was good, YouTube Music(YT Music) is better. It has tons of more features and definitely a better recommendation system.The one up that YT Music has over the departing app is its ability to play music directly from YouTube. It will show results from YouTube, and you can play them either as a song or play the video itself. This covers the base of lacking music of your choice.Hope it helps. Have a good one. ",
