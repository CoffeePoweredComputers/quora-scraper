            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a toss up between \u201cPull Me Under\u201d and \u201cThe Dance of Eternity.\u201d I love both songs to death, for different reasons. \u201cPull Me Under\u201d is my rebuttal to anyone who tells me that James LaBrie is a terrible vocalist. I mean, I get the criticism. Many of his performances starting from Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence felt forced. But, for one, I understand what he went through when he damaged his vocal cords. And for another, when Dream Theater aren\u2019t trying too hard to be heavy, LaBrie really shines with his range and versatility. Forever one of my favorite vocal lines will be when he belts \u201cWatch the sparrow falling/Gives new meaning to it all\u201d after that really keyboard riff. It\u2019s a typical pick, granted but it\u2019s one of the first DT songs I heard, and the first I truly fell in love with. (I of course love all of Images and Words.) I just feel that, apart from LaBrie\u2019s stellar vocals, they manage to find the right balance between technical and catchy. \u201cThe Dance of Eternity\u201d however has that awesome (and frustratingly short!) ragtime piano section, which alone is worth the price of admission. It misses LaBrie\u2019s vocals, but it doesn\u2019t need them. It isn\u2019t a sing-along song, but it is one that gets my head bobbing and my fingers tapping. Virtuoso performances from them all. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh, wow, now this is a though one.  I don't think there is such thing as \"the best\" song. How do we define \"best\"? Is it most popular? Is it my personal favorite? Most technically complex? Most critically acclaimed?  Art is a subjective thing. If I would have to pick one, according to my personal preference, that would probably be something from \"Images and Words\", or \"Falling into Infinity\".  I love \"Under a Glass Moon\" and \"Take the Time\", from the \"Images\" and \"Trial of Tears\" from \"Falling into Infinity\".  But that's me. Most popular would probably be \"Pull me Under\".  If we were looking for something that is critically acclaimed and mature, we'd probably pick a song from either \"Scenes from a Memory\" ( perhaps \"Home\"?), or from \"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\".  Again, this is my opinion. Dream Theater made (and are still making) wonderful songs. Which one is the best? - Go pick up their albums, listen to them all, and pick the one that cuts it for you. I promise, it will be the time well spent. ",
