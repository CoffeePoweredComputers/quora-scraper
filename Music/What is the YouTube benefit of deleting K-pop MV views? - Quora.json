            "answer_text": "People who use bots or obsessively stream are basically rigging the system of Youtube views. There's been an inflation almost because when you see a music video with 100M views it's misleading because it wasn't 100M unique watchers and in fact probably nowhere near that number. If the video gets a lot of views, it will be promoted more, but music videos of groups from small companies who don't have a cult of avid streamers get harder and harder to find. Streamers are also helping the person or the company that uploaded the video cheat with ad revenue. Come on guys, you know that money's not going towards your idols\u2026  ",

It\u2019s not exactly right to delete the views though, because people worked hard on getting them. I get where they come from though. *I\u2019m not sure why some groups don\u2019t have their views deleted though. ",
