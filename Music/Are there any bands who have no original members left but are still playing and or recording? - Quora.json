And it is no exaggeration to point out that Yes has had numerous musicians in its roster over the past half-century.) The most recent studio album issued under the name Yes is Heaven & Earth from 2014. It featured one original member: Chris Squire. When the album was released, Squire had the distinction of being the only member who appeared on every single Yes studio album. Squire passed away in June of 2015. When Yes began a new tour later that year in August, the first show was the first time Yes had ever performed on stage without Squire. ",
