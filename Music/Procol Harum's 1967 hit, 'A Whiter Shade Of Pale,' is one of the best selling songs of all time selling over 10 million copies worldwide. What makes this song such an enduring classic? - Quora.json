            "answer_text": "I was 16 at the time, and can give you the reason it struck me immediately. This was the year of \u201cSgt. Peppers\u201d (by some little band), of \u201cDisraeli Gears\u201d (Cream), of \u201cAre You Experienced\u201d (Hendrix), \u201cSurrealistic Pillow\u201d (Jefferson Airplane), of \u201cThe Doors.\u201d Pop music was moving \u2018experimental\u2019, \u2018underground\u2019, \u2018avant garde\u2019, \u2018heavy-blues\u2019 \u2026 things were getting serious. And in comes this \u2018serious piece\u2019 \u2014 \u201cWhiter Shade of Pale.\u201d With a \u2018classical music feel\u2019 in the Baroque Hammond-Organ instumental theme, played by founding band member Matthew Fisher (who\u2019d had classical training). And a very bluesey voice (songwriter and band leader Gary Booker - who also has the virtue of sharing my birthday!). And very avant-garde lyrics (thanks to lyricist Keith Reid). It landed smack-dab into the middle of the \u2018feel of the day\u2019 \u2026 just perfectly. And \u2026 it is a great melodic song. (it\u2019s too bad IMO that Fisher never got a songwriting credit for it ... this is mentioned by Geoff Menzer below \u2026 re the lawsuit \u2026 Booker wrote the song, but the long-and-repeated organ riff is a huge part of the musical-memory of it). A little on Procol Harum's great drummer BJ Wilson: When BJ took the Procol Harum gig in 1967, he\u2019d been part (since the breakup of the Paramounts in \u201866) of a \u2018studio band\u2019 consisting of himself, a guy named Cat Stevens, and a girl who went by just one name, Lulu. And when Jimmy Page was putting together The New Yardbirds in \u201868 (aka Led Zep), the first guy he asked to be the drummer was \u2026 Wilson \u2014 who declined, having just recently helped form the \u2018permanent lineup\u2019 for Procol Harum. \u2026 that would\u2019ve changed the character of what was to come with Zep, no doubt. DID YOU KNOW: in mid-1967, procol Harum was being touted as \u2018the next Beatles\u2019 (many bands got saddled with that moniker as time went on \u2026) \u2026 \u201cWhiter Shade of Pale\u201d was (Fabber) Paul-n-Linda\u2019s 'song' (they\u2019d just become a couple). Once The Beatles went \u2018poof\u2019, Procol Harum became my favorite band for a couple years \u2014 as long as they also had their great blues guitarist, Robin Trower (through 1971 IIRC). Their 1970 Home album is one of the best-ever. Here\u2019s one of my very-favorite pieces by them (and it does show them playing \u2018live\u2019, stick with it), one of the few that featured Trower\u2019s guitar-playing: \u201cLong Gone Geek\u201d (from Salty Dog, 1969).  (and, of course, \u201cWhiter Shade of Pale\u201d)  ",

Always one for a suitable tune, Johann Sebastian! \u2018A whiter shade of pale\u2019 came amidst so much other than a simple song could ever relay. The Viet Nam war and later Ohio; 4 dead in Ohio.
