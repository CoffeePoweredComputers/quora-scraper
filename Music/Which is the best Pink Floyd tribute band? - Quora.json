            "answer_text": "As others have mentioned, the two most known bands would be Brit Floyd and Australian Pink Floyd . I have seen both live and therefore feel qualified to answer. To say the least, both bands consist of amazing musicians and sound absolutely great live! While Brit Floyd is a nearly perfect copy of the original PF, the Aussies like to have some fun and make small changes here and there during the show (Love the \u201cmen at work\u201d intro for WYWH) . Production-wise, Brit Floyd are top notch and if it wasn't for the lead singer\u2019s voice, you couldn't tell if you listen to them or the real Pink Floyd at their best times! This includes the background girls, I actually preferred their version of GGITS over Clare Torry\u2019s. The Australian Pink Floyd are also absolutely amazing, but not quite up there IMHO. But still an awesome show to attend! Hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "On a large scale, I would go with Brit Floyd, aka The World's Greatest Pink Floyd Tribute Show. Every show is an event and a pleasant massage of the senses. Close your eyes, it\u2019s like you\u2019re at an actual Floyd show. It\u2019s a fantastic spectacle. On a smaller club-style scale, you can\u2019t beat The Machine. I\u2019ve seen them many times over the past thirty years (more often when I was in college in the early 90s), and never grew tired of them. Outstanding performances with such a small group, like the original early Floyd. ",
