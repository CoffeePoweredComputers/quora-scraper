            "answer_text": "Honestly, Guitar Center (as well as most businesses) is infamous for the markup they include in the prices for their products. It's a business practice to ensure profitablility, which makes a lot of sense for any business. But for a consumer it's a little overwhelming to pay as much as their asking for a new guitar, amp, etc. Much like a car, as soon as you buy an instument or expensive piece of equipment, it's monetary value depreciates. That sucks if you just spent $3500 on a brand new Les Paul. Maybe you can find someone to pay up to $3300 for it if you decide to get rid of it. But most people can't find someone to pay full price on used gear, and if you take that Les Paul to a place like Guitar Center, they'll give you about half of its used value. That's why I recommend buying pre-owned from the get go for lesser expensive, high quality equipment. And Guitar Center's used selection is almost unmatched because all of their stores use the same database. Check out used.guitarcenter.com Granted they won't have EVERYTHING, they usually have something for what you're looking for, and it's usually for a steal. I've bought guitars and amps close to - if not straight - half of what they were new. A lot of stuff is in decent condition too. I once found a used amp on their site that I was about to buy from another store in another state, found the same amp at my local GC, and negotiated a price match so I didn't have to have the amp shipped. I went home with an amp, my local store made the sale; it was a win-win situation. Seriously, if you're looking for deals, patience is key, and pre-owned is the way to go. ",

            "answer_text": "I got some phenomenal deals by striking up a working relationship with a salesman there. It was the late 1990s and my kids were really into guitars. In the course of a couple of years, I purchased a new Les Paul Standard, an SG reissue, 2) Martin D-28s and over a dozen Fender Squier guitar and amp packages (the latter for my guitar club at school). I dealt exclusively with one salesman. I found out that he was one of the top two contenders nationwide to win a prize pickup truck in a contest sponsored by guitar center. The prize was awarded to the employee with the highest sales volume in the chain. I agreed to work with him exclusively if he cut me some good deals. He knew I was a savvy shopper who did his homework. I bought them all at different times over the course of a year. I got the Les Paul for $1700.00, the SG and the Martins for $1100.00 each and the Squire Packages (2 at a time) for $125.00 per package (guitar, amp, cord, soft side case, strap, tuner). I also negotiated proces on strings, polish, and other accessories I came in about a year later and he no longer worked there. He was let go by management because his deals to his customers were a little too good. (He really wanted to win that truck and he did!). Those were the days\u2026 ",
