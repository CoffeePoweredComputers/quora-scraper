            "answer_text": "If you mean to just watch them, then you have to download the vlive app. You will then be asked to create an account (you can use your email address or information from another app such as Twitter, Facebook, etc.) Once you have signed in, you should subscribe to BTS channel and turn on notifications so you get notified when they have a live. BTS has two channels. BTS channel has a lot of \u2018surprise lives\u2019 where member(s) will go live to talk with Armys, it also has the BTS Run episodes on it and you will find performances on this channel too. BTS+ channel is for premium vlive members which costs money, I don't know much about this channel as I can not afford it myself *inserts crying in broke* but I know that it has the behind the scenes (the BTS if you will haha) of the run episodes. You can also subscribe to other channels or watch live performances on the app like the Golden Globe Awards that happened a while ago. ",
