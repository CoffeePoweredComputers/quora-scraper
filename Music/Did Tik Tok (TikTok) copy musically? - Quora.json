            "answer_text": "TikTok - Wikipedia \u201cTikTok is an iOS and Android social media video app for creating and sharing short lip-sync, comedy, and talent videos. The app was launched in 2017 by ByteDance, for markets outside of China. ByteDance has previously launched Douyin (Chinese: \u6296\u97f3) for the China market in September 2016. TikTok and Douyin are the same, but run on different servers to comply with Chinese censorship restrictions. The application allows users to create short music and lip-sync videos of 3 to 15 seconds and short looping videos of 3 to 60 seconds. It is popular in Asia, the United States, and other parts of the world. TikTok is not available in China and its servers are based in countries where the app is available. In 2018, the application gained popularity and became the most downloaded app in the U.S. in October 2018. As of 2018, it is available in over 150 markets, and in 75 languages. In February 2019, TikTok, together with Douyin, hit one billion downloads globally, excluding Android installs in China.\u201d Musical.ly - Wikipedia \u201cMusical.ly (stylized as musical.ly) was a social media service headquartered in Shanghai with an office in Santa Monica, California, on which platform users create and share short lip-sync videos. The first prototype was released in April 2014, and the official version was launched in August of that year. Through the app, users could create 15-second to 1 minute lip-syncing music videos and choose sound tracks to accompany them, use different speed options (time-lapse, fast, normal, slow motion, and epic) and add pre-set filters and effects. The app also allowed users to browse popular \"musers\", content, trending songs, sounds and hashtags, and uniquely interact with their fans. In June 2016, musical.ly had over 90 million registered users, up from 10 million a year earlier. By the end of May 2017, the app reached over 200 million users. ByteDance, owners of the app TikTok, bought Musical.ly Inc on November 9, 2017, and combined the two apps into a single app named TikTok on August 2, 2018.\u201d In conclusion: \u201cByteDance owners of the app TikTok bought Musical.ly Inc on November 9, 2017 and combined the two app.s into a single app TikTok on August 2, 2018.\u201d Therefore, currently there is only a single app TikTok available for lip-syncing to music video and sound track aficionados of that particular impressionism towards musical interpretation. Such a shame, but that`s progress folks in the good old U.S. of A. ",
