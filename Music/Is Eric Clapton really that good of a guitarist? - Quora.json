            "answer_text": "There have been many answers already so I\u2019ll try to be succinct. First, let me say that the question kind of misses the whole point. As many (mostly jazz) players have stated, he doesn\u2019t have a big chord vocabulary to which I ask \u201cso\u201d? Neither did B.B. King (although I did see King at a NAMM show many years ago and he played way outside the blues box, and very well) but B.B. wasn\u2019t a jazz player. Anyone that thinks that only a jazz guitarist can be a really good musician is pretty self-satisfied, in my opinion. I think there are two kinds of guitarists, one that plays for the audience and one that plays for other guitarists. You know the old joke; a rock guitarist plays three chords for 10,000 people and a jazz player plays 10,000 chords for three people. Clapton plays for the audience and he should. They are the ones that buy his records, come to his shows, buy his merchandise etc. And they don\u2019t care one iota about how many or what kind of chords he plays. They simply want to stand in awe and have a good time. One thing I\u2019ll say about him, he plays with a ton of feel and like B.B. can get a lot said in fewer notes than most jazz players. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I have a lot of jazz albums and enjoy them immensely, but rarely am I as moved by them as I am by listening to an old Clapton solo (listen to \u201cHave You Heard\u201d on the Blues Breakers album and while you do marvel at the sax intro played by Alan Skidmore\u2014I\u2019ve listened to that track probably a thousand times over the years and I am always stunned by the emotion in Eric\u2019s playing and BTW, turn it up really loud! Even though he was very young when he recorded that track there\u2019s decades of pain in that solo). Another thing; he doesn\u2019t just play notes, he plays his heart. And he, for the most part, is melodic as shit and as a singer I really like that. When I hear a fast rock or jazz lick for the first time my reaction is usually \u201cdid you hear that riff? That speed?\u201d but when I hear something of Clapton\u2019s my usual reaction is \u201cdid you here THAT?\u201d Just \u201cthat\u201d. The whole thing, the feel, the tone, the touch, all wrapped up in \u201cTHAT\u201d! So is he good? He\u2019s better than good\u2026if you want to be drawn in and moved to another plane. He does what all good blues musicians do\u2026he makes you forget YOUR troubles, at least for a little while. So much for being succinct. ",

            "answer_text": "My answer is coming more from a traditional jazz/pop player, so please bear with me. Eric Clapton is or was a very good (rated 3rd on Rolling Stone\u2019s \u2018Top Guitarist\u2019 listing) and an inspired blues based lead guitarist and I think that is where he shined. All around, he is a great and tasteful guitarist when performing the right genre. I thought what he did on the sessions for George Harrison's composition, \u201cWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps\u201d on the 1968 The Beatles \u2018White Album\u2019 was great and very simplistic yet melodic. He was the right man for that song. Eric also played some great hooks like \u2018Layla\u2019 his ode to George\u2019s first wife. So that\u2019s the blues-pop genre . Now the downside. I heard / watched a video of Eric doing \u2018Over The Rainbow\u2019 a rather unsophisticated audience in respect \u201c standards \u201c ate it up. Eric like 99% of players of blues based players never frequented the use of chords, it was all about solos with very little if any thought of what could be done via various guitar chord playing. I read his autobiography a few years ago and I was very impressed with the man. He has integrity to spare . It wasn\u2019t always that way . When this book was written and it gave a brutally honest portrait of Eric. Back to \u2018Over The Rainbow\u2018 Eric didn\u2019t know many chords to speak of other than what most blues players know. That does not lend itself well to tunes that require certain phrasing with the chords outside of the major and minor chords or possibly a diminished seventh chord. He\u2019s not a chord savvy guitarist, and his voice did not lend itself to a song considered a standard . In my opinion, \u2018Over The Rainbow\u2018 was a disaster . To the question. Yes, he is a very talented guitarist in his own genre, it\u2019s just not a classical or jazz genre. Within the blues genre, it\u2019s another story , and more importantly Eric Clapton is a top tier guitarist , as well as a humble human being . ",
