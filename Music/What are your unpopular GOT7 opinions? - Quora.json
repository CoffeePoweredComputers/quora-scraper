            "answer_text": "*insert that one meme of the lady in the car\u2019s voice here* Some of y'all boutta be real mad at me, but it must be said: JB's voice sounds like a high pitched buzzing bee with a deviated septum. It's so irritating when I hear him sing sometimes. Lullaby is an example of this. Regardless, he's a caring leader, really talented and is more suited for RnB.Their choreo is some of the most rigorous and restrictive. People say it's BTS or EXO, but these guys and NCT take the cake for hardest choreo imo. Whatever song they perform choreo to, it only goes for that song and if one tries to choreograph their own thing for any of their popular songs, it looks wonky. So, I've been baby stepping how to dance to \u201cLook\u201d (it ain\u2019t easy as it looks, *yes pun intended* haha)People criticize my queen \u201cLook\u201d for sounding too much like their earlier works, but this song is THAT BITCH and most definitely does NOT sound like their early work (and a whole ass PARTY ANTHEM). It's my favorite song by them, along with \u201cYou Are\u201d.I'm so sick and tired of \u201cLullaby\u201d, which was anything but soothing (like I said, I HATED JB's voice in this song; felt out of place for me cuz he sounded way too nasal). I noticed a car accident as this song played in the background and I can't listen to it the same way anymore. I liked it the first few listens beforehand, but it just got annoying. This song is still the party anthem that we never got though.I'm disappointed with the new comeback concept photos; it's really strange and totally unlike the group, especially the outfits. I liked the present you concept better. But I've pre-ordered the album and can't wait for what they have in store. Also, is anyone coming to the Newark concert on June 27th? Just curious.Youngjae's vocals can outsing half the kpop industry. Y'all need to sleep on beds, not on Choi Youngjae, the \u2600\ufe0f of GOT7.Yugyeom is the definition of a paradox. He looks older and manly, yet sounds like a little boy? I still love our maknae tho. King of Duality.I was initially scared of Jackson, but he is the most social and outgoing one? He also looks like the guy I currently have a crush on.I don't know if people still do this, but please stop comparing BTS and GOT7. They are two totally different artists from 2 different companies with two different styles of music. Don't start BS that they don't get along; people who say these things are antis who have nothing better to do than to stir problems.Mark needs more lines. He's not my favorite visual cuz he reminds me too much of a childhood friend of mine.The autotune in Stop 3x made me CRINGE. Ugh what the fuck??JJ Project: \u201cComing Home\u201d should have been the title track (and should have released a video) for Verse 2.\u201cJust Right\u201d is too childish for me and the boys need more creative freedom. I get the vibe of self love and beauty, but the video was too childish for me. Like grown men singing and wearing THOSE clothes?? Aiyayai.Jus2: senses>>>>>focus on me. Focus is the sexiest album ever, periodt.Antis saying \u201cflop7\u201d and spreading false rumors is basically them seeking attention and not for a good reason. Also, in other news, GOT7 don't give a fuck if you call them these things because they are doing something they love, regardless of what antis say. Bambam said it perfectly: people spread hate on the web, but they don't want to show who they are when confronted about it. Class statement.Miracle is the most bittersweet song I've ever heard, but Jackson's verse low-key ruined the vibe for me. The first time I listened to it, I sobbed for a good ten minutes.As time passed, I realized that Jinyoung looks like an asshole, maybe it's bc of his resting bitch face. But he was (and still is) my bias, so it's all good.Jackson sounds like a rapping chain-smoker in recordings. But when he talks, he sounds so different lol.This whole stalking thing, I low-key saw it coming. But I did not expect it to be foreigners stalking the boys, like where the fuck do you get time (and money of all things) to stalk them? Bitch I barely have time to finish my homework in one sitting. Y'all are whack.Double B should write more of the group\u2019s songs, so should JB and the others.7 for 7>>>>>Eyes on You. This era was Youngjae's era and I hear he was really involved in writing songs for this comeback. Super excited!!!I love the fandom name, it's so cute. Aghase. It sticks.Papillon and Fendiman were shit. Stop hyping them up and doing them fanservice, y\u2019all already knew it was shit from day 1. I liked Oxygen better tho.Man, JB is the under-appreciated visual of the group. I bash him in these opinions (sorry mate), but I like his sexy/mysterious vibe. RIP mullet.It may seem that I have a disdain for JB in my opinions; I don't hate JB, in fact he's my bias wrecker and ngl, he looked HAWT with the mullet. Some of these opinions may be popular, but feel free to discuss with me any of your opinions!! If you agree or disagree, let me know why. I really love the guys and am super excited to see what they have in store this comeback. Much love. (I'm like kinda new to this kpop thing, so lmk some of ur concert stories below as well). EDIT: So, I have disabled comments for the time being bc some people were pressed about my opinion on the group needing to learn English. One person even sent me a 3 paragraph comment about it; I've deleted it (the opinion itself) bc I knew it would cause controversy like this. Also, for anyone who cares, here\u2019s a compilation of the sunshine of GOT7 speaking English:  ",

            "answer_text": "dont hate me, i love them and I really hope these opinions are not real, but these are the thoughts that ive been having lately. Eclipse is their best song ever. People sleep on this song, but it is actually super relatable especially for people in their middle 20s when life is just too confusingMark doesnt have any interest in being a celebrity anymore. The dude has so many potentials but i feel like he doesnt have any clue on what he wants in his life, or any ambition about his career. He just spend most of his time on his brother Twitch channel, and it makes me sad that he spends more energy on his brother game than his own career. I feel really bad for his fans for loving him that much (including me) when he just wanted to sit around in front of computer and play games all day. We expect him to release songs, started acting, prove himself as an artist, but the guy is just there on twitch 24/7 with no intention on improving himself career wise. I LOVE HIM to death but im just so frustrated because he has no motivation or ambition or any greed on anything other than shooting people on games.I feel like youngjae is the outsider of the group. The only person who actually likes him is JB, and thats it. But i kinda understand why the other members dont connect with him, even though he\u2019s nice and all but he\u2019s too individualistic, and like to spend his time alone.The maknae line has a hyung who favors them, JB with Youngjae, Mark with Yugyeom and Jackson with Bam,for sure Jackson wont renew his contract. And for sure he\u2019ll leave Got7 (or anything related to K-Pop and Idol industry) in any opportunity available. He\u2019s very quite and looks extremely bored and gloomy every time he\u2019s with the members.The tension between JB and Mark, what is it? Something\u2019s off between them somehowI dont get why JYP dont let these guys be on variety shows, theyre funny AFthey\u2019ll probably disband next year, i dont see JYP pursuing them since according to JYP theyre not successful enough. The best thing they can do is to make their own label but I dont think they have enough $$ or courage for that, so fellow agase, the november comeback will probably be their last",
