            "answer_text": "I don't know about hard edged, but I was certainly disappointed. It seemed you could always count on John for something tougher, more challenging, or ambitious, and Double Fantasy clearly wasn't that. The fact that half the tunes on the album were Yoko's meant that you weren't likely to love the entire album. I'm not a Yoko hater, but her voice is problematic in both pitch and presentation. She's a worthy artist with great intellect, but her material wasn't particularly strong, and this recording wasn't going to change anyone's mind. As for John, it came as a shock when it was released. I was in my late teens, and though I was (and am) a huge Beatles fan, I was listening to punk and new wave, and the adventurousness of the new music made Double Fantasy sound even more MOR. The first single, Starting Over, sounded too much a weak \u201950s parody, and the slick production was a little too glossy. The entire LP felt like minor material with major league production. Even in comparison to John's solo material, it initially felt like a miss. Plastic Ono Band and Imagine were an artist at the top of his game, and even Walls and Bridges has genuine highlights and a cogent presentation and intimate production. After five years absence, this album was unlikely to fulfill expectations. I should explain I actually REALLY enjoy John's work from these sessions now. Watching the Wheels, I'm Losing You, Nobody Told Me\u2026 there's worthy material, and some bone fide classics for John's canon. But as a younger fan listening to new music at the time, it felt like a dinosaur that was out of touch and desperate for commercial success, with a mediocre partner and second rate material. ",

            "answer_text": "Anybody who is interested in learning more about \u201cDouble Fantasy\u201d should watch this documentary, \u201cLennoNYC.\u201d At the beginning, we hear John in the studio cautioning his fellow musicians as they are performing his song \u201cSteppin\u2019 Out.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s only stepping out, he\u2019s not rushing out!\u201d John says. And I think the same could be said for the whole album.  John had been out of action for a few years, and by 1980, the music scene had totally changed. Punk rock and New Wave, not to mention disco, had ushered in a whole new generation of artists. At 40, John said he didn't want to try to compete with the younger artists, and hoped to reconnect with his own generation. \u201cHow are you? How's your dream going? Weren't the Seventies a drag? Maybe the Eighties will be better.\u201d So his ambitions and expectations were modest. Also, I think John was just getting his feet wet again and enjoyed being back in the studio. On a side note, Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska album came out that same time, and John heard it and said maybe he should have released some heavier stuff on Double Fantasy. So with time I think his old competitive instincts would have been sharpened. Still, the songs on Double Fantasy are a bit tame, but also John sounds refreshed, like he had found his direction after his Lost Weekend of the Seventies. If he had lived, John would have loved MTV, he loved making videos and short films, so I think in the MTV era he would have thrived, and it would have pushed him to make edgier stuff. Shocked that Double Fantasy was MOR? Not really. But confident John still had some great music in him. ",
