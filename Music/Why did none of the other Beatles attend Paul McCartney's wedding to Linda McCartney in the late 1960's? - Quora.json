            "answer_text": "Well, George wanted to attend Paul\u2019s wedding but he could not because he was arrested in the same day. It seems George was the only one Paul invited personally possibly because he was best man for George\u2019s wedding. But he did invite everbody working on Apple. He sent a written invitation. That\u2019s the one John found and got in shock. John got really angry. Don\u2019t ask me where I read about it because I never remember. I only know it was a place that seemed reliable and Paul himself told the story the way someone told him. Mal Evans? Not sure. But Paul was informed that John got really surprised and asked for a pen. He stroke out the word wedding and wrote funeral above it.Then he declared Paul was dead for him. Next day he informed he had decided to get married too, as Paul had done it. Just a few days later he got married in Gibraltar. Sometimes I think\u2026 maybe if paul had not married\u2026then John also had not! OMG! Anyway Paul explained that he didn\u2019t invite John because they had a fight and he was angry. But\u2026it seems things were solved soon as Paul particpated in the Ballad of John and Yoko in a very extraordinary way, playing lots of instruments and singing beautifuly with John. ",

            "answer_text": "Both McCartney and Lennon had private wedding ceremonies at almost the exact same time in March of 1969. Neither one of them invited the other guys. It was the timing that in all likelihood had everything to do with it. The band was on it's way going on to bigger and better heights. John Lennon and Yoko got married in Gibraltar, Spain right by the famous Rock of Gibraltar on March 21, 1969. Peter Brown was a witness, I believe. I'm not exactly sure, but I don't know if John and Yoko were married by a Municipal Court official or if they were married by an Anglican priest? Gibraltar is a British Colony. John wanted to get married in an Anglican church at the time, but because of the fact that both he and Yoko had gotten divorced it disqualified them. Paul McCartney on the other hand also wanted a private wedding ceremony as well. However, he and Linda stayed in London. They married in March of 1969 as well. A couple of weeks before John and Yoko did. Neither one of them probably had no thought of inviting their friends and colleagues to their weddings. They were at a new status by this time, all very wealthy men. Thus, they had their own private planes and wanted to be alone with their new Beatles\u2019 brides. Furthermore, John and Yoko had big plans in store. They both travelled to Holland for their famous bed-ins for peace. ",
