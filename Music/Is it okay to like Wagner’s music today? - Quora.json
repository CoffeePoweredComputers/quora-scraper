            "answer_text": "It\u2019s always OK to like Wagner\u2019s music. Some of it is nothing less than glorious. His leitmotiv system is certainly ingenious and has to be admired on an intellectual level at least. As Mark Twain (I think) wrote: \u201cWagner\u2019s music is not as bad as it sounds.\u201d You will run into people who don\u2019t like his music for purely aesthetic reasons, and they are entitled to their reactions. You will also run into people who don\u2019t like Wagner\u2019s music because of their perception of his politics. They too are entitled to their opinions, although I think they are throwing the baby out with the bathwater. You will also run into people who don\u2019t like Wagner\u2019s music because of how other people used his music long after Wagner himself was dead. They are entitled to their reaction. But you are free to form whatever opinion of Wagner\u2019s music suits you. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure. If you give up all the art from every artist you disapprove of you'll find yourself with little to no art left. Today, thanks to social media, we discover that we are surrounded by people who think and support things that are anathema to us. But we can't boycott or cancel half of our community. If you won't listen to Wagner, will you buy bread from a baker who thinks black people shouldn't vote? Or hire the car mechanic who wants tax funded universal healthcare? Try to be too purist about this and your community or town or country will collapse into civil war. At some point we have to focus on what's good in others, no what's bad. ",
