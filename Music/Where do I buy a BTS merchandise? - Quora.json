            "answer_text": "Due to their immense popularity getting true merchandise with their official label, is like getting your hand on priceless gems. But it ultimately comes down to what you are looking for and how you want to get it. If you like to order things online, here\u2019s a few ways to do that: \u2022 The official BigHit website is a good place to watch for items (because this is one of the few trusted sources for BTS merch since it\u2019s their official company , items sell out VERY quickly so make sure to keep watching and following social media for updates) Big Hit Shop | \ube45\ud788\ud2b8\uc0f5 EDIT( BIGHIT SHOP NO LONGER EXISTS, BUT NOW THEY USE AN APP CALLED WEPLY FOR ALL THEIR MERCHANDISE) \u2022You can use other websites that specialize in kpop merch and albums but do your research before you buy from them so you know their a trusted source and won\u2019t get ripped off. I myself haven\u2019t had any issues so far luckily. A few options I use are Cokodive (my most trusted website for getting authentic BTS merch\u2026 I bought my army bomb from them that I used for the concert\u2026 can be a bit pricey but shipping is included), Kpopmart, Ktown4u, btsmaniashop( now this is more for collecting if you just want BTS merch in general. If your looking for completely authenticity I\u2019m not sure how much of their items are real or not, but I\u2019ve bought lomo cards and and other merch from them and I love them\u2026 but just keep that in mind when shopping from them), and Hallyumart. Those are a few I shop from! \u2022Make sure to follow fellow Army\u2019s as well on social media like Instagram and Twitter as I\u2019ve met some incredible artists who have created enamel pins, paintings, photo cards, shirts, etc and they do little pop up shops and some of the items are soo cool. Plus you have the ability to say you have a one of a kind item because not many people make them. A lot of people go CRAZY for this kind of merch ( myself included lol). Etsy is another cool website to find these items. It\u2019s one of my favourites to check out for custom pieces. \u2022Amazon is another good source for merch, especially BT21 merch, but as I\u2019m sure you know you have to be careful when shopping on their to make sure it\u2019s real. If your gonna spend the money on BT21, you want to make sure you have the authentic plushies and items ( make sure the plushies come in its own drawstring bag with the character and BTS member\u2019s signature on the front and it has the tag with the Line Friends seal on it) that\u2019s the important part. All real BT21 items will have/ come in packaging with that seal! \u2022 If your looking more in person shopping, where I\u2019m from there\u2019s not many options but I\u2019ve been to/ know of a few places. Hot Topic carrries BT21 items, Barnes and Nobles has their own kpop section, FYE also has its own Kpop section, Target carries the albums, Walmart carries some albums (not a lot though) , Sunrise records has a little bit ( that one is kind a hit or miss kind of deals), and of course if your blessed enough to travel to/ live near a Line Friends store, that\u2019s the BEST place to get BT21 items cause they literally have it all when it\u2019s in stock\u2026 I know there\u2019s plenty others but those are the ones I can think of right now lol I hope this helped ! Like I said before due to how big they have become, finding merch isn\u2019t too difficult depending on what you want ! Just do your research and join group chats and meet Army\u2019s. Most Army\u2019s don\u2019t mind helping each other out by answering questions and offering advice! Doing that helped me ALOT when I first got involved into kpop way back when lol! Good luck!!! ",

            "answer_text": "There is a bunch of korean websites where you can buy kpop merchandise. I tried kpoptown, ktown4u and gmarket. They\u2019re all pretty good. I had a problem with kpoptown forgetting to write down my zip code so there was a mix up at the post office :/ so I never ordered there after that, but the packaging was good and the prices were pretty affordable. Ktown4u was okay too, never had any problem with them. I would not buy on sites like yesasia where shipping is free because they add the price of shipping on the product itself so it\u2019s not worth it, you\u2019re paying the same or even more than you would on other websites. MY FAVE KPOP SHOP: Gmarket! It\u2019s kinda like the korean amazon so you have the same products offered by different shops. I always buy from the shop called synnara on gmarket because: trustworthyVery good prices.Lowest shipping costs I personally foundalways have the posters available during preorder period. ( free if I remember correctly)shipping cost is especially good if you buy in bulk, it gets lower and lower the more you buy compared to other stores where they don\u2019t seem to take into account you\u2019re buying a lot and that it\u2019ll be shipped in the same box.Very good packaging, lot of bubble wrap, posters in a tubeYou can pay using paypal ( they\u2019re not the only one, but \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af I like the option :P)They have other stuff from korea too, clothes, food\u2026 and you can buy from multiple stores and pay all at once. Usually the shops will ship every item to a warehouse and then the warehouse package it and ship it to you.Only downside is that the shipping is not that fast, but I personally don\u2019t mind.",
