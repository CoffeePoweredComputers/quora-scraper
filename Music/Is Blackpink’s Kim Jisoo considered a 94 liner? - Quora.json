            "answer_text": "It\u2019s confusing, because of chinese zodiac. I was born in 1995/05/30, so my zodiac animal is pig, because the chinese new year at that time started in 1995/01/31 and ended in 1996/02/18 Jisoo was born in 1995/01/03, her zodiac animal is dog, because the chinese new year at that time started in 1994/02/10 and ended in 1995/01/30 Some people say that Jisoo was born in the year of pig, because they only see by the year, but the days and months also have to be considered. In conclusion, she is not considered a 1994 liner, but she can be put in the same group as some of them as long as you consider the chinese year. ",
