            "answer_text": "There are SO many beautiful hymns; I\u2019m not sure I can say one is more beautiful than another. However, my personal favorite is \u201cLead, Kindly Light.\u201d I love it because of the beautiful harmonies, but for me there is deep personal meaning in the words and story of the hymn. It was written by John Henry Newman in 1833. He wrote this about his experience: \u201cBefore starting from my inn, I sat down on my bed and began to sob bitterly. My servant, who had acted as my nurse, asked what ailed me. I could only answer, \"I have a work to do in England.\" I was aching to get home, yet for want of a vessel I was kept at Palermo for three weeks. I began to visit the churches, and they calmed my impatience, though I did not attend any services. At last I got off in an orange boat, bound for Marseilles. We were becalmed for whole week in the Straits of Bonifacio, and it was there that I wrote the lines, Lead, Kindly Light, which have since become so well known.\u201d The words relate to life\u2019s difficult experiences that we all understand. In the midst of trial, I find it very comforting to remember that God is aware of me and helping me face the darkness. I love the thought that the light will shine just enough ahead for me to see the next step, as expressed in these words: \u201cKeep Thou my feet; I do not ask to see the distant scene; one step enough for me.\u201d There are many times, as I have faced struggles in may life, that the words, melody and harmonies of this hymn have brought me peace and comfort. Here are the words to this meaningful hymn: Lead, Kindly Light \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Lead, Kindly Light, amidst th'encircling gloom,Lead Thou me on!The night is dark, and I am far from home,Lead Thou me on!Keep Thou my feet; I do not ask to seeThe distant scene; one step enough for me. I was not ever thus, nor prayed that ThouShouldst lead me on;I loved to choose and see my path; but nowLead Thou me on!I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears,Pride ruled my will. Remember not past years! So long Thy power hath blest me, sure it stillWill lead me on.O'er moor and fen, o'er crag and torrent, till The night is gone,And with the morn those angel faces smile, Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile! Meantime, along the narrow rugged path,Thyself hast trod,Lead, Saviour, lead me home in childlike faith,Home to my God.To rest forever after earthly strifeIn the calm light of everlasting life. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not comfortable with superlatives when it comes to hymns. There are many beautiful ones; they apply to different readings and different circumstances, and suit different purposes. HOW GREAT THOU ART is one of a beautiful ones.  O Lord my God,When I in awesome wonderConsider allThe works Thy Hand hath made,I see the stars,I hear the mighty thunder,Thy pow'r throughoutThe universe displayed, When through the woodsAnd forest glades I wanderI hear the birdsSing sweetly in the trees,When I look downFrom lofty mountain grandeurAnd hear the brookAnd feel the gentle breeze, Then sings my soul,My Savior God, to Thee,How great Thou art!How great Thou art!Then sings my soul,My Savior God, to Thee,How great Thou art!How great Thou art! When Christ shall come,With shouts of acclamation,And take me home,What joy shall fill my heart!Then I shall bowIn humble adorationAnd there proclaim,\"My God, how great Thou art!\" Then sings my soul,My Savior God, to Thee,How great Thou art!How great Thou art!Then sings my soul,My Savior God, to Thee,How great Thou art!How great Thou art!
