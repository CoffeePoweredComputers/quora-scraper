            "answer_text": "Similarly to pretty much everything about the violin, this totally depends. I change my hair every three months, and I play about 15 hours a week and perform frequently. Per the advice of my teacher, if you notice that your hair is getting bad, it should've been changed a long time ago. Such symptoms include dirt (especially near the tip and the frog), noticing that you have to tighten or rosin your bow more often than usual, changes in your tone and quality, hair falling out easily, etc. I wouldn't recommend changing bow hair less than twice a year even if you barely play at all, simply due to seasonal changes (temperature and humidity are the big factors). Bow hair tends to spontaneously get tighter in the winter and looser in the summer. Therefore, the length of hair actually used to properly rehair the bow varies. If the same length is kept on the bow year-round, it can unnecessarily stress and warp the wood. ",

            "answer_text": "While most of the previous answers focus on periodicity.. it least speaks on the playing experience. A bow gives you an experience and only you can feel it. I have played around a 600 hours on my bow and is still performing at its peak. The secret is to feel the bow and not just go by the periodicity. The Rosen helps you to get necessary friction and you feel that each time. Many artists who perform a 3 hour full concert on stage (in my genre) use 2 bows throughout the concert to reduce wastage if time in applying mid concert Rosen. The life is quite long as I have heard from them. Time to change hair comes when inspite of applying Rosen.. it does not hold through a 3 hour session. ",
