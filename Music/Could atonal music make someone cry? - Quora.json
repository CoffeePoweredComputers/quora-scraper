            "answer_text": "Sure! Why do you ask? All it means is that there isn\u2019t an obvious home tonality. A couple of overtly atonal moments that brought tears to my eyes: Berg\u2019s Violin Concerto The dance break from Cool from \u201cWest Side Story\u201d, which is an atonal fugue with a 12-tone subject and 24-tone countersubject. There was a film adaptation of the Melville short story \u201cBartleby the Scrivener\u201d that had a completely angular atonal score that I can\u2019t track down presently, but it was heart-breaking. There are lots of film scores that use atonal techniques\u2014too many to list. ",
