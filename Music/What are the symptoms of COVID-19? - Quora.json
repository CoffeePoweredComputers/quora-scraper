In 30 % of patients can have a pink eyes, bluish lips in some. In some cases, people who are infected will not exhibit any symptoms.\u201d Indeed, coronavirus can present as a common cold in mild cases.A person can get the infection in 2 to 14 days after exposureMild cases can quickly become worse with breathing difficulty It is called SARS ( Sudden) or Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.Most of the people recover at home with rest lot of fluids and Tylenol for fever and body ache.The best way to avoid is to avoid other people. (social distancing) and wear a face mask and eye protection when going outside.Our African American brothers and sisters, Hispanic and Asian Americans have to be extra careful.There are more deaths in this group. Due to discrimination, lack of good jobs and money and unhealthy food or genetic reasons, many are over weight and prone for diabetes, hypertension. Many smoke. Genetics also plays a part. It is important that we all stay healthy and fit to avoid some diseases. Corona virus does not discriminate. All races can get it.Frequent hand washing with soap and water is important. The virus has a lipid or fat coating or cover and the soap kills it by removing its coating or \u201cskin\u201dPeople coming home from outside exposed to others should leave the shoes away from the living area, wash the clothes or run it through a heat and dry cycle in the washer and take a shower.People 65 years and older or with medical problem are at high risk and have to be extra careful. If one is African American ,Latino or Asian they have more than 40% chances of dying than a white person.. If one is put on ventilator in the hospital there is 70 to 80 percent chances of dying.Now a days they are trying to oxygenate the blood with a heart lung machine to avoid using a ventilator.If some one is a smoker they are at high risk.If some one does vaping,they are at seven times more chances of dying when they get covid 19. Covid 19 can affect practically all the organs of the body including the heart, lungs, kidneys and brain. Some after recovering from the Covid 19 can have lingering health problems for a long time. It is sad that an advanced country like ours is the worst in the world with covid 19 deaths.REMEMBER ,NO STORM LASTS FOREVER. HOLD ON AND BE BRAVE.",

            "answer_text": "There are many signs and symptoms of CoVid-19, many of which are common to other illnesses or infections, and some that are more specific to CoVid-19. Some people may be asymptomatic, and won't develop symptoms, but they can still infect others. Symptoms can develop within 2\u201314 days. 5% of people who do get CoVid-19 will develop symptoms within 2 days of being infected, 50% will develop signs and symptoms within 5 days, and by 14 days, 95% of all people who are infected will have developed signs or symptoms. Here are some of the common signs and symptoms of CoVid-19: Fever, feeling fatigued (very tired), chills (often goes along with the fever), muscle pain, cough (not all people with COVID-19 will develop a cough*), recent loss of ability to taste or smell, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, headache, sore throat. There are also some signs and symptoms that mean the disease is becoming more severe or progressing, and may require someone to seek immediate care. The most common signs of progression of the infection are increased or more severe fevers, an increased difficulty breathing. Anyone experiencing these symptoms should contact a doctor. Patients should IMMEDIATELY seek EMERGENCY CARE if they develop any of these warning signs or symptoms: Bluish lips or face (could mean that they're not getting enough oxygen), increased rate of breathing (breathing faster than normal), feeling shortness of breath with increased rate of breathing, chest pain when breathing (extremely serious symptom and needs medical attention NOW), waking up from sleep feeling shortness of breath (also a very serious symptom requiring immediate medical attention), develop new confusion, or difficult to wake up. All of these are signs that the person is not getting enough oxygen, which is very serious, especially since these symptoms occur within DAYS to even HOURS, in some cases, before going into Acute Respiratory Distress, which leads to the body's organs shutting down due to the lack of oxygen and being unable to sustain fuctionality.
