            "answer_text": "They did not have a HUGE pop presence- of 5 studio albums, only one hit the top 20, and between the US and UK, only 5 singles in the top 10- the most successful in the US being \u2018For Your Love\u2019, which was their most pop release. (three UK singles made it to #3). But think about the words \u2018pop release\u2019. The captivating magic of the Yardbirds post-Clapton music was the awesome diversity in music styles past \u2018pop\u2019- between Beck and Page, we had \u2018Rave Up\u2019 Psychedelia, Gregorian chant, Indian sitars/middle east scales, spacey music, harp-driven electric blues, acoustic guitar solos, and genuine hard core rock with outstanding lead guitar work throughout. For some reason, the public wasn\u2019t buying into this creativity, such a shame. I personally found their pre-Page mixes to sound thin and weak, diminishing the power of these tracks. When Jimmy took over, he used his session work experience to make their sound HEAVY- and as we all know, a precursor the the Led Zep sound. But maybe they peaked too early to catch the transition of pop music into serious statements, and folk stopped listening. Yep, I\u2019d agree, the record buying folk seriously underrated these guys. I won\u2019t quibble about the qualifier \u2018MOST\u2019 underrated, though. ",

            "answer_text": "I like the Yardbirds a lot, they had some great songs. Unfortunately, not unlike John Mayall\u2019s Bluesbreakers, they seemed to fulfil the role of finishing school for three of the best guitarists of their generation: Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page. The combined subsequent success of all three somewhat eclipsed that of their former vehicle. That doesn\u2019t take away from the Yardbird\u2019s achievements, it\u2019s just that they are better remembered for hosting the talents of three superstars. While remaining, without doubt, the template for Led Zeppelin.  ",

History has,however, SEVERELY underrated the HEARTBREAKERS L.A.M.F. LP. if i were a teen now and googled them-i would feel really cheated and pissed that i didn\u2019t know about them.i would nominate them as most underrated! ",
