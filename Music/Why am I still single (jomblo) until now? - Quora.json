You need to thank god.If you single better, you date better, you marry better and you community better.Know that it's your job to love yourself and make yourself happy, no one else's.Become your own best friend. Enjoy being alone. Understand your needs and wants. Develop your hobbies, skills and mindset. Have a vision and work towards it. Have a full life.Infatuation is blind. Love is a choice. Relationships take work.A relationship requires mutual respect, trust, open communication and two people willing to work on it everyday; accepting their mistakes, apologising and changing their behaviour for better.Fear and insecurities are not the reasons for a relationship. You need self-discipline and patience in all areas.To love is to risk heartbreak.You need to work on yourself before you get into a relationship.
