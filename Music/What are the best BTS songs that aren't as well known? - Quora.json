            "answer_text": "Honestly, there are so many. I really recommend listening to their entire discography. 1. Path/Road - SO underrated yet so meaningful, a song contemplating all their thoughts while being trainees/idols. 2. Coffee - The sound of this song is way too nice. I seriously love every second of this song. It also makes you have a wonderful image in mind somehow. 3. Whalien 52 - A song which digs into how lonely they feel. The 52-hertz whale is used as a metaphor in this song, it's called the loneliest creature on the planet as no other whale matches its voice frequency thus it has been roaming the vast oceans along for decades now, calling out but never getting an answer. 4. N.O - Probably their most underrated title track, but it's so important in their definition of a group which talks about social issues. The lyrics are incredibly relatable and motivating but I guess the hip hop style isn't for everyone. 5. Second Grade - A song they made during their second year since debut, highlighting the changes, both positive and negative. How they're proud of themselves but there are still many bashers and critics, though they'll still continue to keep their heads up and work hard even if they feel like this is the end point. 6. Jump - Comparing their childhood dreams of being a superhero to their adult reality. Wanting to get back the same dreams and motivation they had when they were kids. 7. Satoori Rap - A one of a kind song, never have I heard a Kpop song in all satoori (dialect). The Korean name of the song is Paldogangsan, which translates to 8 (pal) province (do) river (gang mountain (san). It shows their patriotism and pride in their country as well their province. Usually satoori I considered funny and \"lame\" but they sing in dialect with pride. 8. Fun Boys - Every single member except Jungkook took part in writing this! It's so energetic and also fun to listen to. Plus the choreography is funny and unique, check it out some time! 9. Reflection - The most underrated solo on Wings. The lyrics are deep and poetic as hell, I mean, \"The world is another name for despair\"? Seriously, go and listen to it properly! 10. Young Forever - Why do we ignore this beautiful track? It has got to be one of the most lyrically beautiful songs BTS have written. It confesses how the members know their same won't last forever but they'll still perform with all their hearts and cherish every moment of being BTS. I've listed 10 songs but their are more songs which I think should be more appreciated: First an foremost, every song on all the rappers' mixtapes, especially RM. Since he released his mixtape first it never git the hype it deserved. I suggest starting out with the song \"Life\". Then I recommend their cover songs. Everyone knows \"Perfect Man\" but what about \"Class Idea\"? \"Come Back Home\" too, Jin's beautiful high notes in the beginning will melt you. Their predebut tracks such as \"School of Tears\" deserve attention too, it showcases how bullying occurs in schools. Another predebut track is \"A Typical Trainee's Christmas\". They also made a part two after debut called \"A Typical Idol's Christmas\". Listen to them to realize the hardships of beings trainees/idols a bit better. Also, Jin's covers are absolutely amazing. Check out \"Mom\" and \"I Love You\". ",
