            "answer_text": "Just for the sake of argument, I assume the question claim is true\u2026Northern Europeans (broadly speaking) are paler. (I think this has been studied, actually, but I am unaware of the details.) The bottom line for me, as an answer, is that we simply do not know why. Some possibilities: The Northern Europeans get less sun, plain and simple. What I mean is\u2026who knows exact skin colors? We see people in natural environments.There is an argument, going back to hunter-gatherers, that the Northern European phenotype was established through the breeding of blue-eyed and darker groups from the south with paler and blonder people from the Northeast.Another possibility is that the pale skin was part of an Indo-European \u201cpackage\u201d that included DNA from Ancient North Eurasians.It is also argued that paler skin developed through natural selection. The paler people were found more attractive or they were healthier. There may have been a package of traits, say the paler males were also taller and were more likely to have more popular blue eyes\u2014resulting in more children.As I understand the issue, the Northern European phenotype evolved quickly. There is some evidence that supports that view. This tends to suggest this outcome was \u201cforced\u201d by human choices or a critical factor. Such a critical factor might be the ability to drink milk as an adult. Some combination of these factors and maybe others (still unknown\u2026to me, at least) is probably closest to the truth. ",

            "answer_text": "This sort of implies that the further north you go the whiter people get, which isn\u2019t true. The people of Ireland and Britain are whiter than people from Sweden and Norway. The islands just act like a rain magnet and any weather that comes from just about any direction turns into cloud and we get no sun shine. We\u2019re whiter simply because we get less sun shine. When we go on holidays we can get a tan, sort of, but it takes our skin some time to get accustomed to the sun. ",
