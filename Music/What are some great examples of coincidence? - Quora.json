            "answer_text": "A few concidences and close calls I've run across: A friend of mine used to work with a Dr Kim in a medical research lab. Friend quits his job one day and at his going away party he shook hands with Dr. Kim. Two days later his next employer, a computer company, sends him on a business trip to Korea. The computer company put him up a a downtown hotel in Seoul. My friend walks into the hotel, into a country where he doesn't not know a single person, and hmm, there is this guy sticking his hand out, he shakes hands with the guy, who is there for his own brother's birthday, the same aforementioned Dr. Kim. ---- My girlfriend worked with Trish. Trish and husband move to San Francisco. We lose track of Trish and Hubby. A year later me and girlfriend fly out to SF, don't tell anybody we are going there. We take a cab and have the driver randomly drive around. At one random spot that looks quaint we hop out. A woman hails the cab as we are getting out of it-- Trish, and hubby and their new baby. Pure coincidence. Our first footstep outside of the airport and in a random walk we meet the only people we know within 1000 miles. --- I'm getting my life insurance policy updated and my agent keeps asking for more and more identifying information. Finally I get tired and blow up at him. So he tells me a story of why he asks so many questions. A few years ago he had a customer come in and say he needed life insurance but no company would insure him. The guy's name was Aubergine Frappinger. So my agent says \"no problem\", and he types the guy's relevant info (DOB, smoker, etc,... ) into the computer and the computer goes \"Boing! Don't insure!\". My agent then remembered, he had been assigned a pile of insurance policies from an agent that had retired, and the name Aubergine Frappinger was in there! The guy was trying to scam the company with two policies! This raises my agent's curiosity so he pulls the first guy's paper file, and he sees why the computer says \"no\", the guy had undergone open-heart surgery. The agent informs the guy that walked in of this, and the guy splutters, \"No, I have never!\". He unbuttons his shirt and shows the agent a smooth uncut chest. In this small town there were TWO Aubergine Frappingers with the same DOB, who went to the same insurance company, ended up with the same agent, and they didn't know each other! --- I had just gotten my very first brand-new car (bad idea BTW), my beauty, my love. It was time for its first oil change so I jacked the car up with my big hydraulic floor jack, placing the jack on a couple of 4x4's to raise it up a bit. The boards slip out, the jack goes crashing down to the driveway, and the 3-foot long steel pumping-up handle comes loose and goes smashing onto the concrete, chipping a good chunk out of it, it bounces and flying up into the air! It goes up about 10 feet, and comes down onto the car. You know how time slows down in a crisis? I swear that pipe came down about one inch per second. It came down twirling, and the soft rubber handgrip end bounced off the car roof, bounced back up, twirled around and came down on the car hood, rubber handgrip end down, then bounced off and went back up, came down and bounced off the windshield, rubber end down, then bounced back up and clattered to the concrete. No harm, except I was shaking from the surprise. ----- Last winter I notice my car headlights are getting dim. I make a mental note to get a new car battery. Being a procrastinator I put this off day after day. The a few weeks later I'm driving to lunch and see the sign of a car parts store. On impulse I stop at the store right then and buy a new battery. I put the battery in the trunk, get in the car, turn the key, and nothing happens. The old battery died just at the exact right time.  Another car one\u2014 I\u2019m changing the ball joints on my wife\u2019s car. I get distracted by a neighbor passing by, we talk for a few minutes, I go back and finish up the job. I then go drive to McDonald\u2019s for some lunch. Drive back the scenic way, through twisty lakeside streets, I turn into my driveway and the from of the car goes THUNK! the left front suspension collapses! I had forgotten to put on one of the nuts holding everything together. The parts decided to come apart in the last 5 feet of a 6-mile drive! \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- I'm trying to fix an expensive signal generator that has a subtle fault. I try everything and partly due to the poor repair manual, I'm getting nowhere. Until I touch a test point with my ancient Heathkit signal tracer, and then everything starts working. That's good, but it makes no sense at all, the signal tracer is not supposed to affect the thing being tested. After a lot more head-scratching and testing, it turned out the signal tracer had a bad capacitor in it, right at the test probe, just leaky enough in resistance and capacitance to be exactly the right value of R and C needed to get the generator to work again. I tried substituting the signal tracer with a resistor and a capacitor, and it was very picky, the parts had to be within 5% of the accidental values in order to make it work. So if that capacitor had been okay or more than 5% off in resistance or capacitance I would never have figured out a fix. ---- John Moore worked at the computer help center. He was getting up in years but he did an excellent job. Everybody liked John so they scheduled a retirement party after his last shift. Everybody gathered in the lunchroom for cake and cookies but John doesn't show up at 4:30. My cubemate gets sent to get John, but he comes back pale-- John had expired at his desk, just minutes from retiring. ---- I park in a large parking ramp at my workplace, ramp has eight floors holding about 100 cars per floor, so about 800 cars. My black wallet drops out of my pocket as I get out of the car, but I don't notice it, so I have to skip eating lunch. I drive home wondering what happened to my wallet. I search at home and don't find it. The next day I drive to work, and as usual have to drive around and around as 97% of the parking places are full. I end up driving down to the sub-basement level, where I find like the last open spot, in the middle of a row. I think, hey, funny coincidence, I'm parking real close to where I parked yesterday, that almost never happens. And wadda you know, my headlights pick out a lump beside the parking spot, my wallet. Out of 800 parking spots I happen to find open, it's the only one with my wallet. Weird. -- A very very close call-- hard to believe but way back you had to be sneaky to get access to computers. When I was in college the computer room, with three 16 by 24 line CRTs, connected to the computer at 300 baud, they were locked up in the grad student's lounge after 5PM. One day after 6PM I wanted to get in there but the door was locked. But it turned out that there were outside steps up to the main door, and from the handrail of those steps you could step up onto a wide stone ledge that ran along the wall and under the window to that room ( with a 15-foot drop to my death or dismemberment into the basement window well ), so young dumb me, I decided to take a chance. I walked out onto the ledge, sidled over to the window, and fortunately it was unlocked. It was a very large, old, heavy window but I managed to pull it up. I jumped in, closed the window and just then the door opened and the full Computer-Science faculty, eight professors, walked in to hold a meeting. They either didn't hear the big thunk as my feet had landed on the floor, or they didn't care, as they just walked past me into the adjacent meeting room. Whew, real close call. It would have been hard to explain why I was pulling up on that window from the outside! --- My father is changing channels on the old GE television (long ago, the TV had an actual knob with channels 2 to 13). Someone on Hogan's Heroes is saying \"And that is how we open the wooden box\". Show is too dumb for my dad, so he flips the channel from 5 to 9 (the next channel with a signal on it). And the next thing we hear is someone in an old movie saying \"And that is how we open the wooden box\". Now what are the chances of THAT? ",

            "answer_text": "My older brother was smitten with the first pangs of puppy love. Across the street from our house, a very cute girl and her family moved in; she was bubbly and full of life. Her name was Annie, and she loved to sing. Sometimes we\u2019d hear her from across the street\u2026 \u201cBus stop, wet day, she\u2019s there I say, Please share my umbrella\u2026\u201d For you younger readers, it\u2019s a song by the Hollies called \u201cBus Stop\u201d. The song had come out a couple of years earlier but it was still popular. My brother would get this distant gaze, stop whatever he was doing and look towards the voice and the song\u2026every single time. No matter what song she sang or what activity we were in the middle of. She was around the same age as Rod. He was fifteen. Eventually (several weeks later), he worked up enough nerve to walk across the street and meet her. I\u2019m glad he did. It was all innocent and honorable; her parents didn\u2019t have to worry about him hanging around their daughter. Somewhere around that time frame, my Father bought Rod a guitar. He\u2019d been asking for one since Annie moved in. He wouldn\u2019t tell me why he wanted a guitar. But I\u2019m pretty sure I knew why. He wanted to learn to play the guitar so he could sing to, and along with, Annie. He was love stricken. I\u2019d see him go over to Annie\u2019s with his guitar strapped over his shoulder even while he was still learning the chords. (He actually turned out to be a great musician, composing his own music and performing in public venues later in life. It was a creative diversion from the staidness of his law practice.) His going across the street had been going on for a few months when I noticed a sudden drop in his visits to Annie\u2019s. At the age we were in, I was twelve, he fifteen, brothers don\u2019t have deep conversations. We pretty much just grunted at each other. It was good enough that we each understood what the other was grunting. I didn\u2019t ask why he began limiting the time he spent with Annie. Although, I was cognizant enough to put two and two together. Out on Annie\u2019s front porch, which faced our porch, I\u2019ve been seeing a young man joking around with Annie. He was over there a lot. He was bigger than Rod, looked older too. What made him easy to remember was his ethnicity. There were hardly any Caucasians in our part of town. He was Caucasian. An American to be precise. Annie came over to our house one day and had a talk with Rod. I wasn\u2019t privy to the conversation, but after that talk my brother was back to spending hours with Annie. Even while Kenneth, the American, was there. The two guys tolerated each other, despite a hint of tension. Eventually, Kenneth went back to the US, leaving Annie all to Rod again. As I write this, I can hear them laughing and singing \u201cBus Stop\u201d, Annie\u2019s favorite. Two years passed. The climate of our society changed, altering our lives forever. It became imperative that my family got out of the country. We said our goodbyes to family, friends, and loved ones; some of whom, we knew, we\u2019d never, ever see again. Including my brother\u2019s Annie. For two brothers who didn\u2019t talk to each other much, on the day we were to leave, I wished I could\u2019ve found some words to say to him. That\u2019s how badly he hurt. We were ripped from our roots and peregrinated over oceans and continents; over 8,500 miles. We were homesick for the longest time. I\u2019m sure Rod had it worse than I. This was at a time when hand-written letters took a month to be received by its recipient overseas, another month for the sender to receive a reply. The next few months were lonely. Soon, my parents became good friends with another set of parents. They had daughters who pretty much matched us in age; I was now fourteen and my brother was seventeen. My brother had his driver\u2019s license and a Ford Maverick, so we\u2019d drive over to Mia and Sophie\u2019s and began spending the summer afternoons there. On one such afternoon, we were hanging out in the living room. Sophie was tickling the ivories of an old mahogany upright, Rod was strumming the strings on his new guitar, (he had to leave the first one behind) and Mia was singing along with him. They have just reached the final chorus of \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d. \u201cThey were singing, Bye, bye Miss American Pie, Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry\u2026\u201d I was reading the latest issue of Mad magazine. There\u2019s a knock on the door. Mia got up to answer it. From the foyer we heard a man\u2019s voice, \u201cHey, good looking!\u201d Mia\u2019s voice, \u201cI have friends over right now. But come on in, I\u2019ll introduce you to them.\u201d It was Kenneth. The exact, same Kenneth. As massive and vast the world is, as populous and large the United States is, he just had to home in on the same state, city, house, and room my brother was in and rival him for a woman\u2019s affections. Again! Rod and Kenneth looked at each. Rod broke the silence, \u201cYou look familiar.\u201d \u201cSo do you,\u201d Kenneth replied. The odds of Rod and Kenneth running into each other must\u2019ve been infinitesimal. Thankfully, both young men were above the level of male beasts snorting and thumping up clouds of dust and battling it out. \u201cDo you sing?\u201d my brother asked. \u201cKnow any \u2018Doobie Brothers?\u201d asked Kenneth. Rod began strumming the strings to \u201cListen to the Music\u201d \u201cWhat the people need is a way to make them smile\u2026\u201d Kenneth sang with enthusiasm. We all joined in, \u201cIt ain\u2019t so hard to do if you know how...\u201d We spent the afternoon in song and laughter among friends. We were home.  My brother singing to his first born daughter. Photo\u2019s a bit ragged from being taken over 30 years ago. (Not Mia\u2019s - Rod ended up marrying someone else.) Postscript: In 2005, my siblings (Rod and our two younger sisters) and I flew home for a funeral. While there, we decided to visit our old house. I barely recognized the house as our driver pulled into the carport. A second level had been added to the house, which was now an office building. I decided to venture inside and snoop around. I was immediately approached by four stern men with automatic rifles; security guards. I identified myself. I told them this used to be my Father\u2019s house - Rene Garcia. I am his son. They allowed me to explore a little bit while keeping an eye on me. After a while one of them approached me and asked me to leave. Fine by me, the parts I saw were cut up into ugly office cubicles. I didn\u2019t care to see the rest. My siblings were timid about going in and stayed out on the porch. The porch remained unchanged; it\u2019s where Rod and I first heard Annie singing. My two younger sisters were reminiscing about the neighborhood with each other. I walked past them and stood beside my brother. He was looking across the street with that same distant gaze when we were boys. Across the street was an empty lot. Annie\u2019s house was gone. I remained quiet, unspeaking. I believe he was listening to echoes of Annie and her songs. To answer some questions posted on the comments \u2013 I don\u2019t know what ever became of Annie. *Some names have been changed. ",
