            "answer_text": "Hi A2A, Sounds like you had a rotten day. Sorry to hear it. You are still very young. It\u2019s hard to shake things off until you grow some thicker skin, that is the best part of growing older. I would not want to go back in time and be young again, never mind be in school and take shit from a stupid teacher ..I got upset just reading your details, I wanna kick his ass\u2026 BUT\u2026 I would like to give a civilized kind of response, now that I\u2019m older, wiser and don\u2019t have to take any crapola from anybody, really\u2026I will hand it back. That took some years though; years of being too nice and then learning the difference between being nice and being a ..doormat? Victim? Someone who held it in until I was bursting and flipped? You could have a private talk with that teacher, or you could even report his behavior because it was abusive and upset you so much. Maybe he should know! I think so but only you can answer if that is a way to help you feel better. Don\u2019t ruminate-it leads to feeling worse, so speak about it, don\u2019t hold it in. There\u2019s a big difference between being too sweet or being a horrible witch. Unfortunately I went through a period in my 30s or so when I was intolerant of little things, like people who chew with their mouth open, or guests making a mess in my house, I would get aggravated by my friends helping wash up cuz they\u2019d chip the dishes! Silly examples that come to mind before I finally got to the point where I realized: Don\u2019t sweat the small stuff. Like, dishes are replaceable, friends are not. Pick your battles. Make it worth it for yourself, not about revenge or out of anger. Though anger has its place! Sometimes it\u2019s justified. Not over chipped dishes of course. But being bullied or humiliated is simply not acceptable and you would probably feel better if you could get some kind of acknowledgment that this is wrong in a school setting. Don\u2019t absorb the negative-like when that teacher ragged on you? Put it in a box. He was a geek. Maybe he was having a bad day or hates his job or whatever-he is human The bigger challenge is realizing your unique quality and value-and believing it. Not simple for anyone, old young male female whatever-it's the biggie, the sooner you start, the better. You don\u2019t have to advertise, just know and acknowledge your good points. If you are more gentle with yourself you will most likely feel more gentle and tolerant towards others. But it\u2019s not easy when you\u2019re young! Especially if you are being ill-treated by a teacher. When I was finally a senior I remember telling a teacher what a bore his class was..hahah. He was mad I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re lucky enough to have positive input from people you trust, or if you\u2019re an only child , or without close friends. You\u2019re questioning yourself. Hopefully your self-awareness will help you choose not to let others mess with your self image.! And do yourself a favor-don\u2019t ruminate. I know it makes me crazy, and I know it makes others crazy too. No imaginary arguments will help you feel better, it makes it worse. Confrontation is scary but if done with dignity (never my strong point cuz I lose it when I\u2019m angry so I avoid it) it is the most satisfying way to be validated. I wish you strength, don\u2019t torture yourself about others. How we live is up to us. ",

            "answer_text": "Jesus. Okay. Stop giving importance to these small things. I love how you gave examples for me to work with, it really makes the job a little easier :) Analyze things. Your teacher got mad at you and I can understand how it can be upsetting and/or embarrassing for you. But think if it\u2019s really gonna matter to you in the long run. He\u2019s a teacher in the institution in which you study. You will probably never see him ever again after you graduate from there. Actually you don\u2019t even need to go that far ahead in time. He\u2019ll probably forget about it the very next day. Or week. The worst he can do is have a grudge on you and try to lower your grade because of that or somethin\u2019. You can always complain to the authorities if that happens. Besides, being a teacher, it\u2019s is job to not be distracted while teaching, and clearing doubts IS a vital part of it. If he\u2019s getting distracted, it\u2019s his shortcoming and perhaps he\u2019s just taking it out on you. So don\u2019t worry. Even I have a ma\u2019am like that. Take these people with a grain of salt. You get upset over little things. But do little things make you happy as well? If not, you\u2019re just ignoring the things in life to be happy about and unnecessarily worrying about things that don\u2019t matter. And trust me, most of the things don\u2019t. And the guy on the train, he in my opinion was needlessly rude. Ignore the rudeness and get the essence of what he was trying to say. He was just telling you to move. The rest is all just words decorating that perfectly harmless statement. Perceive them as just that - harmless words. You will probably NEVER see him again. Why get upset over something so insignificant as a couple of words said by a person who doesn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t matter to you? Your peace of mind is bigger than those things. Relax a little. Chill. All the best :) ",
