            "answer_text": "Of all the pop superstar transformations we\u2019ve witnessed since the early 2010s, the most astonishing comes in the package of Katy Perry, the bubblegum pop pinup throwback who can belt out a great, mean-spirited hit like \u201cHot and Cold\u201d one moment and a homophobic piece of trash like \u201cUr So Gay\u201d the next. At least, she could (and did) back in 2008. Today, Perry has changed with the ever-evolving, sexually liberated times. She came clean at the NEA\u2019s Human Rights Campaign Gala this Saturday about her actual experience kissing girls and liking it. Can we say we\u2019re that surprised? \u201cHow was I going to reconcile that with a gospel-singing girl raised in youth groups that were pro-conversion camps? What I did know was I was curious and even then I knew sexuality wasn\u2019t\u2026black and white\u201d Perry has come a long way from her early California Girl persona, and we\u2019re thankful for that. We need her on our side for the fight ahead. ",

            "answer_text": "Katy Perry has always confused me with her sexuality. She never explicitly says what she is and leaves it up for other people to figure out. Her first song was \u201cUr So Gay,\u201d a song many people dub as \u2018homophobic\u2019 (this makes me laugh, because it\u2019s normally straight people that say this, even though I\u2019m bisexual and absolutely love the song), but her second song (her first big hit) was called \u201cI Kissed A Girl.\u201d So even early on, Katy\u2019s been pretty confusing with her sexuality. However, since she has stated to \u201cdo more than just kiss a girl\u201d and said that \u201cI Kissed A Girl\u201d is about \u201cthe magical beauty of a woman,\u201d and that inspirations for the song were Scarlett Johansson and a girl she kissed when she was a teenager (\u201cI did kiss her. I was totally obsessed with her. She was beautiful- porcelain skin, perfect lips.\u201d), I think it\u2019s safe to say that Katy is bisexual. ",
