If you haven\u2019t listened to it, I definitely recommend it, even if you don\u2019t have a translation handy. And even better if you can see it live (we had two performances in my area just last week!) because of the wall of sound you get from \u201cO fortuna\u201d alone. Also, I\u2019m inclined to agree with Tim Ward that \u201cIn Taberna\u201d is probably the greatest drinking song in any language. I\u2019d love to see what song could beat it! ",
