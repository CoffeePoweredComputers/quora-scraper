            "answer_text": "Echoing Sam Morningstar, Morello came of age at a time when it was fashionable for young men to adopt a vaguely anarchist-libertarian politics. It was also well before the \u201dGreat Awokening\u201d, so young white men were far more likely even than today to skew rightward on questions of PC. Lastly, people tend to cement their political identity (among other aspects of their personal self-image) in their mid-late 20s. Many hold on to opinions that later appear to be quaint or outdated or irrelevant. So, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Morello had held onto some opinions, particularly on social questions, that would today appear quite conservative. That said, RATM was overtly quite radically leftist, so it\u2019s possible he merely settled into mainstream liberalism after he was done dabbling with radicalism, and then later participated in the Awokening.

            "answer_text": "This terminology can vary a bit. In other words, what is conservative to some will not be to others. You\u2019d probably have to clarify what you mean by it. However, with that said, I think Morello is basically an anarchist. I don\u2019t know what his flavor of anarchism is, specifically. But, I\u2019d suspect he might adhere to some notions of rights that might overlap with American conservative libertarianism. This is fairly common, at least in at the theoretical realm, when these folks are talking about freedom of speech, or even right to self-defense against oppression/tyranny. Although, I think Morello is a rather consistent Leftist. And I\u2019ve never heard him express quote-unquote conservative views. ",
