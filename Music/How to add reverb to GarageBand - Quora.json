            "answer_text": "For GarageBand iOS (on iPhone, iPad, etc.), you firstly have to have a track (audio or midi), then you click on the Track Controls button which has the 3 sliders icon. Now you have two options: Slide the Reverb knob at the bottom of the Track Controls screen. If needed, tap Master Effects for what kind of reverb you want, orTap Plug-ins & EQ, then tap Edit, tap the plus icon to add a reverb plug-in of your choice. The easiest way is just the default Track Reverb plug-in in the Effects slide, tap on that and you have your customizable reverb. Predelay is to delay the reverb send. Spread is how big your reverb. Reverb Time is how long your reverb goes. High Cut is how much you cut the high frequencies (far right is bright, far left is dark). Dry/Wet is how loud your dry/wet signal is.Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "You can add reverb to any track or to the entire mix. Look at the right hand end of any track and you will see a list of effects, reverb being one of them. You click on Reverb and adjust the level. To add reverb to the whole mix, first you mix and then add effects. You can also use one of the preset Masters, which will add a set of effects. Play around with it, you will learn all this step by step. Start clicking on things and opening them and exploring. You can always delete the Songs if you don\u2019t like how they turn out. You can also delete any track you do not like. ",
