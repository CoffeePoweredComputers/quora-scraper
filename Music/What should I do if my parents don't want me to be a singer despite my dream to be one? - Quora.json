            "answer_text": "Think about how many people at a concert like to sing along, or would if they were confident enough.  Imagine how many people dream of being on stage or communicating to such an audience with musical expression, by voice or any other instrument. Now, take a dose of reality.  Not everyone can become an artist that has the popularity and fortune that people associate with musical artists, entertainers, vocalists.  Even if you do, you have to sing the same song over and over.  It's not a \"sing what you want\" kind of thing.  You become dependent on happy fans that have purchasing power and free time to create the stimulus to make you popular.  With the advent of free music online, you can only make money if people will pay to hear you sing.  You can't be just a recording artist, you must have the skills to perform live, both vocally and as an entertainer.   It's not necessarily impossible, but when you dream, you have to plan. Start by being honest with yourself.  How good are you?  Do you have a vocal instrument that can go that far?  You may not be able to tell right now, but without excellent vocal coaching and healthy practice, you may never know.  Lessons cost money.  Can your parents afford them?  How serious are you?  Do you have other dreams you want to pursue?  Consider your age.  Consider your education.  Consider your experience thus far.  How have you been evaluated, and by whom? Whatever else you do, you must be absolutely certain that you have other things that you can do, besides sing.  You need to prove to yourself that you are not dependent on this one dream alone, because the reality is that you probably won't make it.  Do well in school.  Get your diplomas and degrees before you venture too far. You can be an artist at home, for family and friends, and in your spare time, after school, chores, and being a good family member and citizen are successful.  You can't sacrifice those things in order to pursue this dream.  Happiness and success will not become true with the dream alone.  It must be shared with family and friends who are proud of you. However, if you are able to accomplish that well, and still have energy and persistence and strength to pursue this dream, only then, don't let it stop you from trying.  Learn about music, your vocal instrument, the science behind everything, history, how the industry works.  There's a lot more to it than just singing. There are very few success stories that came easily.  Sure, people can name them, because there are so few.  The ones nobody ever hears of are the ones you need to remember are out there. You don't have to give up, but you have to think hard and make sure you have other dreams, and then decide when and how to pursue them appropriately.  If you are young and your parents are supporting you, you can't do whatever you want, because you need them and they love you.  Don't throw that away, either.  Sit down and have a talk, if you're that serious, and figure out how to get evaluated well and what kind of connections you can find in the industry to get yourself some exposure, and see what experts say.  Until that happens, keep your focus on what you need to do now - school, home, family, and saving a little time for dreaming. ",

            "answer_text": "I am highly confident you are very young, which is why these questions subsequently are popping up.  Your parents are most likely worried that you are not going to have a job or profession that provides you a secure or comfortable living in the long run, and often this is a normal case when it comes to being a musician. Do not completely ignore what they have said; the truth is, it is not easy to make it big as a musician, especially since there are millions of extremely talented individuals out there. Being able to sing, play an instrument, know your music theory, compose or write songs, etc is totally not enough because the competition is extremely intense, and if you have not paid your dues or possess the thick skin required to survive, you will most likely succumb and even lose your passion and desire altogether. Speaking of worst case scenario, you might also be left in a financially difficult state if you do not have a job that pays well for your living, which is a reality that quite a number of musicians out there are facing.  That said, all is not lost. I do not know if this will help, but if I were you, I will make music as a 'hobby that pays' instead of something I will focus totally on in the long run. While you work in a well-paying job in the morning, you can work as an events singer, join a semi-professional choir or equivalent, where you can sign up for auditions if required. Probably a similar path might work for you in case you really want to balance working and being a musician at the same time. However, do not take my word for it; just keep doing what you like, and if you are meant to make a full living out of it someday, good for you :) ",

            "answer_text": "I think your parents just want you to have a back up plan. They aren't trying to be unsupportive i think.  They don't want you to give up on being a singer, but they're thinking ahead to what if you don't \"make it\". Many talented singers don't                                                            Imagine (and i speak from experience) that you don't become successful in what your dream is. Singing is very competitive, and it's talent yes, but also a lot of luck and who you know. Not to discourage you, but you can see hundreds of talented singers on singing shows who struggle. What happens if you never get recognized for your talent? Forget being a \"star\", what if you can't get a regular job singing every day that pays the bills? You need a back up plan. Maybe a singing teacher? A voice coach?  Is there anything you would like to go to school for that you can do as a back up plan? Imagine you spend every day singing, making demos and sending them out, trying to get gigs, and then suddenly you're an adult. You're making $9 an hour waiting to get your big break. Many people do jobs they hate or are low pay following their dreams. There is no shame in that. Even if they don't make it, they aren't failures as people. But your parents don't want to see you struggle or be disappointed by not lack of talent, but by just the way the business is. So go with a back up and ask for their support in both.  ",

            "answer_text": "I gotta agree on that one with your parents. Chase your dreams, and shoot for the moon, as long as you know what you\u2019re getting into. Your parents are probably very smart people, and even if they are not, they\u2019ve seen some shit. The reason they don\u2019t want you to sing probably has nothing to do with prejudice or hate against music, but they probably think that you do not know what you are getting into. For every singer you see on Youtube or in TV there are THOUSANDS of sad and frustrated people, who thought they could make it big, but then their dreams were shattered by the cold hard boots of reality. Because making it as a singer, or any artist for that matter is very hard. And if you don\u2019t make it, according to payscale, your salary is going to be around $40,000, which is very low. Like, very very low. Additionally, even if you don\u2019t make it, becoming a singer takes a LOT of effort, and it is going to be a boring job for the most part, having to do mundane labor similar to a factory line worker\u2019s for 8\u201310 hours a day, and then some in the evening. So please, before you lash out at your parents, please think this through. Saying \u201cI\u2019ll make it\u201d is like planning your adult life on winning the lottery. You\u2019ll be making around $40,000 a year while having to do mundane practice for 8\u201312 hours a day, even on weekends. ",

            "answer_text": "I wanted to be a singer too, and I am one!  I am sure your parents would not object to singing in a choir at school, or church, or community choir.  We singers do  need outlets.  I also found some local Children's Theater and had parts in musicals during the summer.  You  get a lot of basic training and chances to see other talent.  If you are good, you will get solos or some choice parts.  Your parents may be impressed and more supportive. I still keep my day job though and learned other skills to support myself.  The pay  and opportunities may not be very stable and there are rarely benefits, unless you  get a manager and record or performance contract.   Your parents are probably worried that finding work as a singer is very difficult and may not support you.  If you are passionate and talented, you will stick with your dream and take every opportunity to keep singing in your life. Learn how to support yourself first though, then keep on singing, if this dream is meant to come true, you will find the door.   Save up for voice lessons, learn basic piano and learn how to read music.  If you are truly committed, you need to have these basic skills.  Your parents do not have to support this, you can do this yourself if you are truly committed. ",

I mean, the chances of you making it are smaller than winning the lottery, unless you have some serious links in the industry already (and they must be pretty good). We\u2019ve all heard the rags to riches stories, but often the dark side has been cleverly concealed from us - it\u2019s not all fame, fortune and friends, there a dark, less mentioned dimension to it to. I\u2019m not trying to discourage you in any way, but if you can really ONLY sing, then have a good backup plan (eg. have a good education, learn other skills) before you pursue your singing dreams, otherwise it\u2019s just a harsh, bitter dose of reality you\u2019ll have to endure. You won\u2019t earn enough to even support yourself (99.99998% of the time), let alone start a family or to treat yourself sometimes. Let alone becoming a star. ",

At the same time, they mist often want the best for you. I know this isn\u2019t 100 percent true but most parents want what\u2019s best for their kids and know what they\u2019re talking about. Take both of those into consideration. My friend wants to be a fashion designer. Her parents aren\u2019t fond of the idea. So what she did was look at the benefits. The things that would appeal to them as well. Job openings. Wages. Alternatives that go with it. She\u2019s offered to also look at going into buisness as a minor type thing because she wants to start a fashion business. Her parents are definitely more open than they have been in the past. Look at their point of view. Appeal to it. Know what they\u2019re thinking and work from there. ",

Step 2) Find a couple of nauseating reality shows with out of business musicians as judges basking in their apparent past glory, participate there and your parents will start supporting you (this may even be the plot of an upcoming movie) Step 3) Record your songs and post on YouTube, create a FB page and regularly post your recordings, you will find a couple of loyal fans who may or may not listen to your song completely but will surely give you a like and if you are lucky a share. Step 4) Find people in similar situation as you are, form a band and compose few songs and perform in few college fests and get noticed, if your band somehow manage to win a competition, while accepting the award, create an anecdote regarding your \u201cstuggle\u201d and show the world how \u201cbadass\u201d you are. Step 5) Meet your band and jam regularly, try basics like singing devotional songs with western music. Ensure that the genre of music, songs and lyrics are completely unrelated. Step 6) Find a similarly rebellious friend who is struggling to make a movie, compose songs for free in his \u201creleasing soon\u201d movie. After doing all these things, your parents will finally accept you and your passion, hey, another plot for a movie, on the plus side movie in a movie. ",
