            "answer_text": "\u201cThe quality of the voice is dependent on many factors; however, barring a physical vocal disability, everyone can learn to sing well enough to sing basic songs.\u201d ... So it's a matter of learning to relax the vocal mechanism and use supported breath to produce the sound, rather than trying to make the voice 'do something. Singing is more of a learned skill than a natural talent, said Steven Demorest, a music education professor at Northwestern University who recently published a study in the journal Music Perceptionthat compared the singing accuracy of kindergartners, sixth-graders and college-age adults.

I was one of them - in fact I was perhaps the best example of the unfortunate group. He did manage to get most of us into members of the school chorus. Given that example, I believe the answer is \"Yes, you can be taught to sing better.\" How much better would depend entirely on the abilities of the voice coach you choose. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, everyone can improve their voice with the right instruction and regular practice. In the beginning you will be making some rather unpleasant noises while learning to coordinate your vocal apparatus but have fun with it and always know that if you can make a bad noise you can turn it into a good one!  Find a vocal teacher who can teach you the style and technique that you are interested in singing, and make sure that they are encouraging rather than critical. Confidence building is particularly important for new singers. There are some great online singing courses that I would recommend. Check out Felicia Ricci or Brett Manning on YouTube. Both are great teachers and will give you some great tips to get started. Be excited about learning to sing. It can be frustrating at times but it's also the most wonderful feeling in the world when you realise that your voice is improving. Good luck.  ",
