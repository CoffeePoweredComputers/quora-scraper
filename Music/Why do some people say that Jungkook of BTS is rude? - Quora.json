But some HATERS say that because of (as far as i know) 2 incidents 1- Actress Han Ye-seul came to golden disc awards with a nose piercing, there was a clip showing jk making hand movement like a ring on his nose and saying something. Haters said he was \u201cmocking her\u201d but he actually had said \u201cIt must have hurt\u201d. our innocent baby\u2026\u2026 2- it was during Mamamoo\u2019s Hwasa\u2019s performance, kookie was drinking water, and then he seems to have been choked, then he turns and says yoongi something and then they laugh. Many said that he commented something about the performance but rather it seems like he choked and was about to spit water on namjoon, which he told yoongi and they laughed about it. Haters will hate, we cannot do anything about them, so lets forget about them and do what we do, support our idols.  the 2 incidents are mentioned in this youtube video ",
