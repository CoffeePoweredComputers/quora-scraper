            "answer_text": "This is purely my opinion!! When I\u2019m doing it member by member I\u2019m only going to do my top 10 if that makes sense. RAP It automatically comes down to BTS or Stray Kids. I\u2019m going to go with BTS though for a couple of reasons. You have to include the entire rap line when taking this into consideration. I\u2019m aware the entire BTS rap line, Jisung and Changbin all write lyrics. Felix and Hyunjin do not though. Not writing lyrics doesn\u2019t make you any less of a rapper but writing your own lyrics just goes to show how much more advanced someone is (People used to consider rappers who did write their own lyrics as true rappers) Felix and Hyunjin are amazing rappers and could definitely be Main rappers in another group but they aren\u2019t as good as BTS\u2019s rap line in my personal opinion. Felix relies on his deep voice a lot and Hyunjin is actually really good in every area but I think Jhope, Suga, and RM shine a bit more. Jungkook and V can rap as well. Chan can also rap and Minho can kind of rap. (Edit: Chanyeol is a good rapper! He\u2019s not bad at all but I think he should stay where he is on this placement. He almost always has the same flow and his raps kind of sound similar. It\u2019s fine considering he\u2019s so multitalented though. If you disagree that\u2019s fine but make sure to watch rap videos about the people above him before disagreeing!) Here\u2019s how I would rank them separately. Only official rap line. Changbin/RMJisung/SugaJhopeHyunjinFelixJungkookChanyeolChanVSehunChangbin is a speedy rapper but RM probably has one of the best flows in the industry. This is really hard to be honest. I\u2019d lowkey say they\u2019re on equal footing if I didn\u2019t have to choose one. I think it really comes down to personal preference. Ranking: BTSSTRAY KIDSEXODANCING Stray Kids! If we were only taking the dance lines into consideration then I think it would be BTS or EXO. Taking the entire group into consideration then Stray Kids for sure. Stray Kids come from JYP which is a company known for dancing. Minho is probably my favorite dancer in kpop along with Ten but I promise I\u2019m not being biased. I\u2019m pretty sure their weakest dancer is I.N but he really isn\u2019t that bad. He\u2019s average in my opinion. In EXO, Chen and Chanyeol are the weakest dancers and in BTS the weakest dancers are RM and Jin. Stray Kids also probably have the most difficult choreographies. Separate rankings (from what I\u2019ve seen): Lay/Jhope/Kai (They all have different styles)JiminMinho (I haven\u2019t seen his full capabilities)JungkookHyunjinSehunFelixVChanJisungRanking: STRAY KIDSBTSEXOVISUALS I think they\u2019re all very good looking but if I had to pick it\u2019d be EXO!   The official visual line is below  Since it\u2019s a ranking, here it is (PERSONAL) EXOBTSSTRAY KIDSVOCALS EXO! There was no competition here, sorry! They come from SM and they probably have the best vocals in the industry. Evidence: Chen! Baekhyun! D.O! Suho! Xiumin! Lay! Chanyeol! Sehun! Their rap line can sing. Separate Rankings: ChenBaekhyunD.OSuhoLayChanyeolJungkook/Suengmin (I couldn\u2019t pick ok?)ChanMinhoRanking: EXOSTRAY KIDSBTSAnyways yeah! That\u2019s it. Remember this is all my personal opinion!! The hardest part was definitely the Rap part. I\u2019m pretty sure the \u201cweakest\u201d (he\u2019s still better than most rappers) rapper in Bts is Jhope and I think he\u2019s better than Hyunjin/Felix. That\u2019s how I sort of chose that one. But yeah! Thanks for reading!! ~Liz ",

            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: This is my opinion!!! Rap: Overall, BTS hands down I mean you have NamJoon, Yoongi, and Ho-Seok. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Jisung, Changbin, and Hyunjin of Stray Kids are also impeccable when it comes to rap but I mean in my opinion they are more like idol rappers and BTS\u2019s rap line are more like actual rappers. Sorry, if anyone\u2019s feelings were hurt on this one but BTS wins this one.  Dancing: Now this is a hard one because you have Jimin and Ho-Seok from BTS, Kai and LAY from EXO\u2026\u2026 I think I\u2019m going to give this one to Stray Kids because in my opinion, they dance the best as a group. BTS and EXO didn\u2019t win this category only because some of their members dance better individually and not as good as stray kids when it comes to the cohesiveness that it takes to dance as a group. I\u2019m not saying that EXO and BTS are bad it\u2019s just I prefer Stray Kids when it comes to the dancing.  Visuals: This is a little hard but in my opinion the most visually appealing group would have to be EXO. I mean just look at them    I mean don\u2019t get me wrong Stray Kids and BTS also have some visually stunning group members but I think EXO takes this one as a whole. Vocals: You already know who bout to win this one. Yes junkook and jimin are good vocalist and Chan and Seungmin are also talented vocalist, but nobody and I mean nobody can battle the real Kings of Vocals. EXO hands down wins this round and it really isn\u2019t up for discussion either. You would literally have to be deaf to say that BTS or Stray Kids have better vocalist\u2026\u2026\u2026I\u2019m kidding but nonetheless EXO wins this round.   ",
