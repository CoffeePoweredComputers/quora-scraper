            "answer_text": "I don't consider Eminem the best musician or even the best rapper of all time. He is definitely one of the best of all time and a legend, but I don't think he quite surpasses some works by lesser known rappers- Biggie, Tupac, Nas. His triple whammy of 3 classics- 1999s Slim Shady LP, 2000s The Marshall Mathers LP, and 2002s The Eminem Show. He also released Lose Yourself, which topped the charts around the world for weeks. He was everywhere from 1999 to around 2004, I don't think anybody who isn't a head of state has gotten as much media attention as Eminem. His name was mentioned over 200 times in 2002 alone in just the New York Times. You could find him on national news, MTV, the radio, the newspaper, tabloids, magazines- any form of mass media available in 2000. People talked about his early albums for weeks, and the controversies surrounding lyrics stuck for months. Lose Yourself was all over the radio for weeks after, and in 2003 right after its #1 run ended a song by 50 Cent (who Eminem helped gain attention) took its place. He was the artist, let alone rapper, from 1999 to 2003. That's one of the most competitive times in music and hip hop. He outsold everyone- even the mainstream pop singers he blasted on record. From 2000 to 2010, he was the best selling artist in the US. He sold far more than any pop singer, and the #2 spot was taken by the Beatles (granted the Beatles haven't released music since the 1970s, it amazes me how they could sell so well 40 years later). However, it does say something when probably the best band of all time outsells everyone except one person. He is the best selling rapper of all time (despite efforts to not sound too mainstream) and the 6th best selling solo male artist or all time in the US. 6th doesn't sound too high, but you have to realize that list includes Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, Elton John etc. He is one of the best because he is in the top 3 for best lyricist of all time, and is most definitely the best lyricist alive (Kendrick Lamar makes a compelling argument but it's too early to tell in his career if he will continue to make classics). The word play and meanings behind lines is staggering. On some verses literally every line has a double or triple meaning. There are sections where there are so many rhyme schemes going on it's hard to keep track. Multi syllabic rhymes, double and triple entendres multiply rhyme schemes in one line (sometimes even one word) Rap God has a grating beat and a pretty bad hook, but try not being amazed listening to the third verse and trying to keep up reading the lyrics. In addition, on early songs the beats were incredible. They helped Eminem flow really well and meant it was catchy, even if not every single word rhymed. There's just something unique about the passion which goes into Eminems work. Sometimes he screams into the mic, while other times it sounds like he is actually about to cry in the studio. The delivery is always fiery, fast paced and Eminem does a great job of announciating extremely well. This is part of the reason why he was so controversial- you could actually hear how fucked up some of the lyrics were on the Slim Shady LP. Sometimes he says the filthiest parts extra loud, as if to taunt the listener who turns it down anticipating something dirty, only for Em to defiantly turn the volume up- found in Rap God a lot. Another Eminem strength is his huge variety. From absurd exaggerated comedy like Purple Pills and My Band, to radio hits like My Name is and The Real Slim Shady, to motivational songs like Lose Yourself and Till I Collapse, to fast paced lyrical masterpieces like Rap God and Offended, to political tunes like White America and Untouchable, to dark ones like Stan and Kill You, to rap rock like Sing for the Moment and I'm Back, to horrorcore like Remember Me, to truly sad tales like Mockingbird and When I'm Gone, to concious hip hop like Walk on Water and Believe, to modern hits like The Monster and River, Eminem does it all. If it has a beat, he has probably covered it along with damn near every flow imaginable. He keeps it real and sings on a record (Haileys Song). How many rappers cover that many moods and sing? He has a song for any mood you are in. Finally, Eminems music sells so well because everyone can relate to certain songs. You don't have to be a crips member in LA to identify with the message. You could be anyone and find motivation in Lose Yourself because everyone gets nervous. The message is often universal- and I hate to say it but much more people can relate to the struggles of a white male than a black rapper. Most white/ Hispanic/ Asian people don't face the issues blacks do. As a result, they don't identify with the song when it talks about \"the struggle\" or racism. Till I Collapse is the most popular workout song- its a 15 year old song and is not even a single and yet it is played more around the world by gym goers than any hits from today. There just will not be anything like Eminem, both in terms of music and the icon he was at the turn of the millennium. The world just wouldn't quite be the same without him. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for requesting, I never get bored of writing about Eminem!! So I'll tell you why Eminem is the best. He's officially the best Artist of decade 2000\u2019sHe does have 152 awards to his name including the one of the biggest to \u2018the biggest\u2019 - Oscar!!No one really hates him, He's one of the most (He's the most respected but don't want to respect someone's feelings) artist from the industry! Everyone appreciates his music from a kid to the grown ups everyone listens to his records!!People emotionally connect themselves to his music, that guy doesn't even knows how many lives he has saved, how many people he has motivated, I am talking about the ones who thought to give up on things or give up this life either (You're reading it from one of them). You can't listen to any other artist probably when you're messed up and want to cry!!He's the one guy who never shows off, you won't even hear controversies about him when he's not working, not even media tracks him because he's so simple that they don't get spicy stuff to report in news, OH yeah and that doesn't means he doesn't have popularity, The guy is on Billboards official list since decades, He never gets down! Maybe a few time but I never noticed! For example his 15 years old was on top 200 list last month!!He's simple, not the one walking on red carpets with a suit who wants to blend in with the crowd and look attractive!! If he wants to wear a trouser and a jacket he'll do that, Well he'll do it and for the record he always wear trousers at any award show!!He was nominated for Oscar, the guy won the damn Oscar but he didn't went to collect it, Why? Well his daughter had to watch cartoon at the exact same timing so \u2018F*#k the Oscars\u2019, Let's watch cartoon together!! He said \u2018My daughter is the most important thing to me and if she needs me whatever I am doing I'll drop it and be there with her and he has actually proved it multiple times!!I am sorry for such long points, I can keep it going! If interested please ask in comments I'll add more!! Have a nice day. x) ",
