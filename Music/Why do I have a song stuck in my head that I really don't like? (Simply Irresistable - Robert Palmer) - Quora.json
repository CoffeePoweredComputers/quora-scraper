            "answer_text": "It is a catchy song, but otherwise I do not know. Often wonder if it\u2019s triggered by some type of memory association when it happens to me with older songs like that. A few weeks ago, I could not get Leo Sayer\u2019s When I Need You out of my head. I found myself singing and humming it under my breath. I was 7 when it came out. I do not own the song in any form, and do not recall hearing it recently. I don\u2019t actively dislike the song, but I\u2019m not a big Leo Sayer fan\u2026.it\u2019s not something I would chose to listen to. Maybe something happened that day that took my brain back to 1976 and Leo Sayer subconsciously? Some odd associative connection. It\u2019s just weird. But at least it fades pretty quick. I didn\u2019t even recognize the song at first, just bits and pieces of it, so I sang the words and hummed the tune I remembered to my mom, who did know it. Actually seemed to help to listen to the song on youtube all the way through. Ear worm exorcised. ",

            "answer_text": "That happens to all of us. And I bet that it\u2019s been happening since music first began being recorded. This happens to me, my friends, and my parents (and my grandparents also experienced it). As in your case, it can be a song that you don\u2019t really like, or even some annoying commercial jingle. In my case, it\u2019s usually a song that I like. As for \u201cSimply Irresistible,\u201d although I don\u2019t mind it, my favourite Robert Palmer song is \u201cHyperactive.\u201d It conjures up rather dark images for me, because of the way that it is featured in the 1987 film, \u201cThe Bedroom Window\u201d (which is underrated, if you ask me). A serial killer is on the loose, and a rather drunk young woman is seen dancing in a very provocative manner to that song just before he murders her. And so, whenever I hear that song (which is on my iPod), I can\u2019t help but think of that scene. If you want to get it out of your head, I suggest that you try playing another song. That might work. ",
