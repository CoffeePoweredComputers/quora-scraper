            "answer_text": "I would have said \u201cNo, its never too late to do anything\u201d. But then it reminds me about a small story that my guitar teacher shared with me recently. So he said, find what you really want to play as soon as you can. Don\u2019t try to learn everything. As you grow older, there will be lesser time today than yesterday. And by the time, you become good at guitar, you would realize that you are too old and no body wants an old guitar player. I am 25. I started playing when I was 17, almost the same age as you. And I graduated from undergrad when I was 21. So I believe you are in the same situation that I was into a couple of years ago. I actually gave up on guitar because I wasn\u2019t finding enough time to practice and thus, I was not becoming better at it. I was really frustrated. So I did not play for more than once a month when I was 22 ish. By the time, I settled into a job I started missing guitar. So I took my guitar out and started playing once again. It did not help much because the break was quite long. But this time, I did not give up. I kept practicing with whatever time I had. Recently, I started going to a guitar instructor once every week to keep myself motivated. I am not learning exactly what I want to play. But he has been really helpful in fixing my technique. And currently I play for atleast 1 hour before work in the morning. And yes, I am better than I was 2 months ago. Consistency and perseverance is the key I believe. I regret wasting that year of not playing guitar at all. As you progress through life, you will have times when a lot of things will supersede guitar, more pressing issues will come up. This is true even if you are not playing professionally. But always remind yourself about why you picked up guitar in the first place -> to be that rockstar you always wanted to be. You don\u2019t have to do anything professionally in order to excel in guitar by the way. Joining a band will surely help tighten you up. But at the same time, if you have a day time job, it would become really stressful and you might end up in a situation where either you are thinking about guitar while working, or you are tensed about your work while playing guitar. Try to keep things simple. But do figure out what you want to do early on, no matter how crazy it may sound to anyone. Thats generally true. From your question, I feel like you don\u2019t know for sure what you want to do. But you are scared on the inside that once you graduate, things will change and you will move further away from your guitar. So, my advice is - figure out what you want to do exactly with guitar or music in general. I completely understand this feeling if this is what you are feeling, as I have been through the same recently. For example, I am an engineer by profession and I produce my music independently. And I am totally clear in my mind that this is the way I want to live my life. Get rid of this state of high entropy because its going to bring you a lot of stress over the period of time. If you don\u2019t know what career paths are there in music industry, I would advise you to take a look at this fantastic course on Online Video Tutorials & Training Getting Started in Audio and Music Production | Lynda.com Sign up for a free trial for 30 days. This is not a boring tutorial, instead its just a simple guy explaining what is required for each career path in music industry. I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to do anything with it professionally, then why don\u2019t you take music in college and major in guitar? Because here\u2019s the thing, without the (too) long explanation: If you want to do anything professionally with guitar, then why would you not have time for it? That tells me you\u2019re not going to study guitar in college because some other major will take most of your time. If you\u2019re not taking music in college, then how can you be a professional guitarist if your only practice time is a couple of hours off probably in a week because you have to study something else not music or guitar? If you think you can get by with using all your free time on guitar, what is your idea of a professional guitarist then? By the way, playing gigs in a club doesn\u2019t make you a professional, nor does releasing a record with you playing guitar in it. Being a professional guitarist means you have the ability to earn a living just playing guitar. ",
