            "answer_text": "Oh yikes, I thought this was gonna be about something starting with \u2018p\u2019 and rhyming with \u2018corn\u2019 for a moment there\u2026but okay it's about Youtubers. So. I'm only 13 but, yeah, I swear a little bit. Yeah, I watch Pewdiepie and Danisnotonfire and a bunch of others. You want to know why I swear? If I'm talking to someone, nope, no swearing because they might a) not like swearing or b) think I'm swearing at them. Instead, I'll swear when I hurt myself (honestly, a quick little word and it actually helps me feel better) or if I'm very passionate about something (\u201cI swear to someone, that is the cutest puppy I've ever seen in my whole. F&@$#%*. Life.\u201d-Me meeting my friend\u2019s new dog). I'm the politest I can be while dropping the occasional f-bomb at the - wait for it - appropirate time. Not around parents, little kids, or people I don't know for certain are comfortable with it. What was that? Why do I watch those Youtubers then? Oh, that's easy. I'm a little thing called a human, and the thing that helps a human to have a good life is, you guessed it, having a fun life. Now, some people might enjoy beating up old men with their friends. Others might think shoplifting it fun. Those are things that some people may enjoy, but no one should do. HOWEVER, there are some things that are fun, legal, and harmless. Some people might like baking, some might like eating the finished result of said baking. Some people might like making YouTube videos, and some might like watching them. Some people like doing art some like looking at art some like performing music some like listening to music some like learning things some like teaching them some like writing books some like- okay, you get the point. LET YOUR KID BE WHO THEY WANT. Also, sexual content? Okay. Sure. Can I just ask you to go to Spotify. I want you to click on the songs you might hear on radio, or go to the top hundred or whatever it's called. Now I want you to listen to a song. You realise that most of them are about the-big-S-word, exhibit a lot of swearing and are, oh look at that, vastly innapropriate for someone who can't even watch YouTube? You can't ban your kid from everything even minorly rude. My advice (if you want to take it, I mean, I'm 13 too, and a vast disappointment to anyone wanting me to be an angelic young child) is to let your kid do what they want, within reason. Let them listen to the radio, watch YouTube, date(appropriately). Give them a talk about what is okay and what's not, have consequences if they misbehave, but don't ban them from something they love to do. Part of being a teenager is discovering who you actually are, not who society wants you to be. (This sounded a lot better in my head. Anyway, happy new year and goodbye!) ",

            "answer_text": "You know, you will not always be able to control the outside influences on your child. As he grows older, his life experiences will diverge from your life experiences. Until my own children got to that 10\u201313 age, I really didn\u2019t know this part. When I was finally confronted with this knowing I did 2 things. One, I watched stuff my son found on line with him. We had good communications and trust, so we watched the porn he tripped across, not a lot, just enough to ask him to think critically on it. How is the camera viewing the woman. Looking down on her, looking up at her? Is the mood insulting, is it complimentary? I advised him to stay away from things that were negative in tone. with my sons, respect for women was very high on my parenting agenda. With my daughter, the focus had to be on self esteem, and self actualization. Heck, I really didn\u2019t like The Simpsons, (quite mild these days), for many years, and did not let my kids watch it until they were a bit older. Again, I sucked it up and watched too. A lot of it wasn\u2019t actually as bad as I thought, and when it was, I said something. I critically viewed it. I was also a parent who was quick to point out TV ads that showed people \u2018justifiably\u2019 lying, or giving ridiculous reasons to feel bad, or trying to make it look like a car was equivalent to the love of your life! Evening \u2018family\u2019 sitcoms are also bad for creating humour at the expense of another character. If was excessive, I would tell my children, it offended me, personally, and why, and we would be watching something else from now on. There is harmful subtle influences around your child on a day to day basic, never mind the overt influences. Sexuality is already in almost every aspect of your child\u2019s social experience, (the sexualization of children in GAP clothing ads), so don\u2019t hide from it. Face it. See it, and speak out load your critical thinking and evaluations around your children. Talk about the message it is sending, how it\u2019s trying to influence their thinking, and their desire for things. Tell them how it makes \u2018you\u2019 feel\u2019, and why you are consciously choosing a different feeling. They will learn from what you do, not what you say, \u2018to\u2019 them. Perhaps some of this opening up to thinking critically will be new to you, but if you want your children to grow up feeling whole, then you have to make the effort to truly see, what makes YOU, not feel whole? And sometimes, it is okay to ban something from, \u2018your\u2019 house. I wouldn\u2019t let my children play 007 because of people directly shooting each other when they were still under the age of 10. The one my son borrowed had a paint ball gun setting, and I let that go on it for about a week, until he decided to not use that setting when he thought I was not looking. Taking glee in shooting his little sister was not tolerable to me. Then I made him trade back for the one he lent out. Did he play it at his friend\u2019s? For sure he did, but my sense of values was still known to him. Later on we got when they were tweens we did bring Super Smash Bros. into the family and had a lot of fun with it. Pick and choose your battles carefully. In the end, giving them a strong set of values is more important than having, \u2018rules\u2019. ",
