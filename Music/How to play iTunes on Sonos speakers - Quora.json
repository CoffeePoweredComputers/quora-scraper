            "answer_text": "The other two answers are correct; there is no way to natively stream music from iTunes to Sonos without a PlayBar or an Airport Express. Sonos want to tie you in to using their own app and streaming protocols, even though the app is utter garbage, particularly for Apple Music users. Fortunately, some clever, kind folk put together a work around: AirSonos.  stephen/airsonos AirSonos is a little open source application that allows you to stream music to your Sonos speakers using Apple's AirPlay, which is far easier to use than the Sonos app. Setting it up requires a little familiarity with the command line, but there is enough documentation online to make it possible for anyone to install. I've personally been using it for years now, and while it isn't the most seamless solution, Stephen and the other developers have done a great job making an app that works. You can find the installation instructions and download links (it's 100% free!) in the link above. Note: I claim no ownership of or responsibility for this software. it was developed by much smarter people than me!  ",

            "answer_text": "There are a few ways. Traditionally Sonos reads your music collection, including playlists in iTunes and you then control the music from the Sonos Controller - an App on your phone, PC or Mac. If you are hell bent on using iTunes you can do the following: Use a Play:5 in conjunction with an Apple AirPort Express which has a headphone out and then you can AirPlay from iTunes to the Airport Express which will automatically play on your Sonos Play:5 and any connected Zones.Use a PlayBar - connected to your TV which is also connected to an Apple TV. You then AirPlay to the Apple TV. In Sonos you then play the TV and can extend it over many zones.",
