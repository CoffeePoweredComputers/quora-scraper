            "answer_text": "Sorry if I'm slightly misinformed. Blackswan has been formed by the same company who debuted Rania (Dr Music). I believe this group has debut in attempt to replace the later group. In all honestly, I'm really hoping they treat this group better than Rania, although my expectations aren't really high. Incase your not aware Rania had a black member named Alex Ried. Who they basically just used as a \u2018Token black girl\u2019. They never gave her any korean lessons, and so she could only speak in simple sentences, the only time she spoke fluently was when performing. They never hired a translate either so she barely knew what her daily routine or schedule was untill short noticed. She didn't have a story relationship with the members because only one member spoke broken English. For alot of the stage performances she would only appear for 30 seconds or so before disappointing off the stage. Cameraman would purposely show footage of the other members when she was performing. She would also always be made to stick out from the group. If the members were red she would be in purple etc.  In all honesty. I honestly believe it will just be another Alex Rania incident again. I've fully watched their debut MV and I'm disappointed. Just like Alex, Fatou got the least amount of lines and the majority of it was in English. Not only that but she is made to stand out from the members in several scenes. If an Entertainment company wants to debut a group with a non-Asian member, they shouldn't use this fact as a way of showing off. The member should be treated exactly like the other members, not made to stick out even more.  ",
