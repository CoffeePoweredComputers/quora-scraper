            "answer_text": "I beg to differ. Here in the Pacific Northwest, everyone who wears glasses sports a hat with either a front bill or a wide all-around brim. It keeps the moisture off your lenses. When it\u2019s hot and sunny (which does occasionally happen)? Well, then you have to keep your face free of sunburn. If you\u2019re experiencing male pattern baldness (as I am), you also need to keep your scalp unburned. Of course, most of these hats are purely functional and not really decorative or fashionable. Perhaps they\u2019re one of the root causes of the Northwest \u201cgrunge\u201d look. ",

And I\u2019ve lived in some pretty cold places before moving to the desert in south California. I don\u2019t know how they did it. All you do is sweat constantly even if it\u2019s cool outside and then you have to worry about wind gusts. I think men just realized that it was a completely unnecessary piece of apparel and you had to take it off when you got into your car anyway. ",
