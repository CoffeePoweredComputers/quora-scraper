            "answer_text": "Here are the very brief technical answers: Sound propagates through gasses, liquids and solids as pressure waves. Audio is the electrical analog of those pressure waves. Voice is the result of modulated air pressure vibrating tensible membranes in the throat that produce pressure waves in air that are perceived as sound. To covert sound to audio requires a transducer, such as a microphone, which converts pressure waves into voltage. To covert audio to sound requires a transducer, such as a loudspeaker, which converts voltage into pressure waves. Humans and animals perceive sound by way of converting pressure waves into nerve impulses in the ears. To use the word Voice as a verb can mean to read a written passage out loud. In the context of audio and sound reproduction, to voice a system can refer to the process of adjusting the tonal character of a reproduction system. Best, David Lee BASSBOSS ",
