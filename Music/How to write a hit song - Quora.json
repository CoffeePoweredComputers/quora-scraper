            "answer_text": "Good musicians songwriters write\u2026 Great musicians steal . Melody is key . Come up with a little melody . Think about how Coldplay does this. The melodies are simple, but good, and repeated constantly thru their songs. A melody can be made easily , pressing the white keys on a piano ( the song will be in the key of C but that doesn\u2019t matter much for purposes of my example. ). Start with the first white key , the one before the 2 black keys. Press that key, skip a white key, press the next white key , then pick any other white key. Repeat this in a pattern like 1,2,3,4 ( 4:4 timing ) and you have a melody. I don\u2019t even know what it would sound like . The important part is that you have a melody anyway. Make your songs short. Find a song you love , and for purposes of this exercise, replace the lyrics with lyrics of your own , play the same notes on your instrument . Do this a few times for practice with a few of your favorite songs. Soon you will be able to get ideas and melodies from multiple songs and apply them into one song . Remember , no one artist or band was the first artist to ever come up with the melody in their songs. There are only so many notes, and so many realistic ways to play them. If you are mathematically inclined , you can take basic melodies and change up the timing a little ( like the band rush does a lot. ) example, instead of counting 1,2,3,4 -1,2,3,4 ( 4;4) or 1 thru 8 ,or 1,2,3 1,2,3 ( which is 6/8 timing ) 4 -4 and 6\u20138 will be the timing of about 99 percent of anything you hear on the Radio. counting to 5 then repeating gives you a 5/4 structure ( or 5/8 ) Counting to 7 is another cool way to change it up. But these are advanced methods of somgwriting , and the general public does not really typically fall in love with odd time signatures \u2026 that\u2019s because they are odd, or dissimilar . They don\u2019t make your head bob like a normal 4:4 or 4:8 or 3:4 or 6:8 song. 3:4 songs are typically a little more Latin sounding , 4:4 makes a pop song . Etc. The next thing - will your song be happy or sad? This should be the first choice you make when your going to write something. Because if you want a happier sounding song , your going to write something in a major key. Sad \u2026 minor key. I\u2019m just touching the tip of the ice burg when it comes to music theory . If you just want to write a song . Copy melodies and ideas that others have done , change them up a little , and you might just have something depending on your level of musical abilities of course. Your going to need to be able to play an instrument and possibly sing. Actually garage band on the I phone has so many ways to pick and choose samoles and sounds to make a song. It\u2019s necer been a way I\u2019ve written music. I\u2019ve always played the guitar and sang. Then had musicians that wrote drum and base parts for my songs with my guidance of course . If you like to go to live shows, that\u2019s a great place to start. Observe your favorite musicians , take notes on the things they do. I\u2019ve always said that ITS NOT WHAT YOU PLAY, but HOW YOU PLAY IT. Good luck ",

            "answer_text": "Observe the world around you as much as possible - try to notice details about people, their behaviours, their interactions. Try to understand how the world works objectively. Look at effects and try to figure out their causes. Listen for curious stories and opinions and events. Don\u2019t filter things you disagree with, these things are just as useful to your songwriting process as the things you already know and believe.Read as much as possible. Learn as much as you can. Be a sponge. Keep an eye out for interesting words, terms, phrases and language devices.Take notes. This is important. Write everything down. Every flicker of a thought or a feeling can be useful later when you come to write your songs. While you\u2019re doing these things in your day to day life, note down your observations and what you\u2019ve learned. Write down interesting lines or phrases, interesting concepts, interesting ideas - anything that can contribute to making your lyrics stand out.Unless you want to write the same love song that has been written about millions of times, you need to be trying to formulate your own perspectives and your own take on things. You need to be more active in your pursuit of knowledge than most other people so that the songs you write and what you have to say in them are actually interesting.Think about things from multiple perspectives - you don\u2019t need to take one person\u2019s perspective when writing lyrics. You can dance around, speaking from different people\u2019s points of view. You don\u2019t need to only say things that you truly believe or describe you own behaviours - you can present viewpoints you don\u2019t agree with and ideas that aren\u2019t your own.When you sit down to write, start with a simple melody on whatever instrument you\u2019re proficient on, then dig into your notebook. The notes in there will get you started and also give you something to refer back to when your mind gets stuck.When writing you\u2019re marrying rhythm, melody and words and they usually feed into each other. Start with something small and simple and develop it from there. Sometimes it will flow easily, sometimes you will need to think very deeply about what you\u2019re trying to convey. Write down the first thing that comes to your head but be prepared to massage it and bang it into shape. Keep an eye out for cliches and remove them - there\u2019s always a better way to say what you\u2019re trying to say - it might just take some careful thought.When stuck, refer back to your notes, look up different words - synonyms/antonyms/rhyming words etc (I use stormjournal.com). Try making your sentences based on a different person\u2019s perspective. Think about the counterpoint to what you\u2019re trying to say and try attacking the sentence from that angle.If you manage to write only one sentence or one paragraph or one verse but then get stuck, leave it and come back to it. Sometimes you can get through the writing process while banging your head against a wall - with pure determination - and sometimes you just need to step away and come back to it. Sometimes you need to let the idea mull over behind the scenes while you go about your day. Sometimes you need to do more exploration, find more ideas. As long as you\u2019re persistent about returning to your seat to write, you\u2019ll get it done.Good luck. Writing songs is very rewarding work. ",
