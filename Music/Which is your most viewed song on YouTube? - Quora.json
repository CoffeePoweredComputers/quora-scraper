            "answer_text": "The music video for Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee song \u201cDespacito\u201d has become the most-watched YouTube video of all time. With just under three billion views, it knocks Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth track \u201cSee You Again\u201d - the official song for Fast & Furious 7 - into second place. Khalifa and Puth only submerged Psy's 2012 sensation \u201cGangnam Style\u201d from YouTube's top spot last month, but couldn't prove a match for \u201cDespacito\u201d which The Guardian reports is averaging about 15 million new views a week. To put it's success into perspective, \u201cDespacito\u201d managed in seven months what \u201cSee you Again\u201d did in two years. 'Despacito' lyrics translated to English are incredibly dirtyThe hit single, which features Justin Bieber, has enjoyed stratospheric success since its release seven months ago becoming the most streamed song in the world just last month with global streams of more than 4.6 billion plays. The song knocked Bieber's very own \u201cSorry\u201d into second place with combined streams of 4.38 billion on platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music. Dance track \u201cDespacito\u201d - which translates as \u201cslowly\u201d - has reached number one in 45 different countries, including the UK, since its release in January and was the first Spanish-language song to do so since \u201cMacarena\u201d in 1996. \u201cStreaming has opened up the possibility of a song with a different beat, from a different culture and in a different language to become a juggernaut of success around the world,\u201d said Sir Lucian Grainge, chairman & CEO of Universal Music Group.
