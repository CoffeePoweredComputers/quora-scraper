            "answer_text": "Restoring iPod Classic Without iTunes (Solved!!!)My last be all and end all try was to try and reformat the iPod through Windows, by right-clicking the iPod drive and selecting format. NOTE: I saved all my music off the iPod by showing hidden files, going into ipod_control folder and dragging the music folder and playlist on my PC. (I am not going into detail here, I assume everyone checking this out is computer savvy) I didnt change any of the settings, I just clicked start with quick format selected and of course everything got deleted off, which is normal. I removed the iPod, put the iPod into Disk Mode, by pressing the menu/center button until the apple logo appears and then quickly pressing the center/play buttons until you see a check mark with a Disk Mode message. Then connected iPod to PC Started iTunes, sure enough iTunes recognized the iPod, but gave a message that the iPod is corrupted and needs to be Restored with updated software. Clicked restore in iTunes, takes a couple minutes to update and voila. I then dragged the music files I saved on my PC, with the playlist back onto the iPod through Windows, not in iTunes and everything is back to normal. ",
