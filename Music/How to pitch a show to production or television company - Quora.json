            "answer_text": "When you select a production company or studio to pitch your movie or television show, you first call them up and find out if you can talk to someone who is a producer. If the receptionist responds by saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t accept unsolicited material\u201d (which most of them do), ask if they accept query letters. If they do accept query letters, then send it in with a one or two sentence pitch of your show and have that series Bible ready. ",

            "answer_text": "The hard part is to even find out \u201cwho\u201d you should talk to? Most will never accept an unsolicited pitch for many legal reasons. Find out who are the producers of productions similar to your stories and research their contact info. Hire an Entertainment Lawyer to get you in some doors. Good luck. ",
