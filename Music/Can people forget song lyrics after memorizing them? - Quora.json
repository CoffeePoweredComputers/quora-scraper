            "answer_text": "Absolutely. I hardly remember any of the lyrics to the songs we sang in music class in grade school, though we performed them from memory at assemblies. As a keyboardist, my focus is so much on helping the singer with the basic gesture of the song that I often don\u2019t really memorize the lyrics anyway. I might know them while we are preparing to perform, but they vanish, or recede to the amygdala or somewhere in the brain they\u2019re hard to retrieve. However, music sticks better in the brain better than about anything. Could you draw on paper an accurate picture of the house you grew up in, or a favorite restaurant, or remember what you said the first time you kissed someone? Powerful memories, but they don\u2019t stack up to music memory. Folks in the Alzeheimer\u2019s ward at the rest home start singing the old songs when I play them. Music sticks, somehow. If you memorized a song and want to get it back, you might get the music to it and prime the pump - just like unplugging a water line, suddenly whoosh! And the song comes back; or maybe it will come back a line at a time. Nobody really knows. When I wrote a song, one of my first songs, I was in my car, and sang it over and over again and had it down. But when I got home, I stupidly ate some food and took a nap, with the idea of getting up and writing it down. It was gone! But two weeks later, I was out walking along an irrigation canal, relaxed on Sunday afternoon, BAM! It came back, and I had no paper with me, so I inscribed it on the back of a check book with a key.
