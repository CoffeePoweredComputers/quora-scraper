            "answer_text": "Music has powerful emotional effects. Some aspect of your life is preventing you getting that feeling without music. This is not ideal but to an extent I identify with your situation. I have trouble forming emotional connections to people. It does happen but it\u2019s rare and there are only a few people in my life with whom I feel strong emotions. Music on the other hand can easily make me feel elated. I connect to it on a deep level. Most of my happiest moments of the last decade have at least involved music. Interestingly I find it easier to connect to people when music is involved. I don\u2019t go as often as I used to but I still love a good dance music festival and one of the reasons is that the music can pull me up so high, give me so much positive energy, that I want to share this feeling with everyone around me. So when a complete stranger approaches and smiles at me I smile back. When they offer a hug I hug back and I feel that connection. You may want to consider therapy. I say this as someone who hasn\u2019t gone and has no interest in going. Even though maybe I should. But it\u2019s possible it might help you. If you have any close friends (I am lucky to have a couple) try to identify what\u2019s different in your relationship with them and see if you can apply that more broadly to your other personal interactions.

We come across songs whose lyrics or even music composition seem to crawl into our minds to perfectly express these feelings. This could be the case for you. Is it difficult to describe what you\u2019re feeling? ",
