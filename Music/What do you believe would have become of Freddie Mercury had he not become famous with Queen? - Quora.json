            "answer_text": "He was a strong and flamboyant performer in the first place, he was born to be a star. Check out the solo works he did on the side and he also sang with a Spanish soprano in the late 80s. One way or another, Freddie Mercury was going to be a Champion, an icon, a superstar. Maybe not quite a cultural all time big name in the sense that Mick Jagger is but nonetheless Freddie was going to be notorious, a big STAR. ",

He even knew he didn't want to do it until he was in his 70s. Which the boys from queen now are\u2026. So if Freddie had his way, he would be gone by now anyway\u2026 would of been great to have him just a wee bit longer tho ",
