            "answer_text": "Punk is not about mohawks and outrageous clothing, unless you're referring to the sub-punk culture perpetuated by Malcolm McLaren in order to promote himself and his 'SEX' store.  Punk is about protest. What makes you angry? What injustices get you riled up? For example, the punk song \"Alternative Ulster\" by Still Little Fingers was about the state of life and living in a tense Northern Ireland during the civil unrest there.   It can be about something you observed and were upset about. Such as the Ramones when Reagan visited a German cemetary where mebers of the SS were buried. Their song \"Bonzo Goes to Bitburg\" became punk legend:  Punk is not about hate, it's about using your outrage to open eyes to a cause dear to your heart. The Ramones debut album was about living life in the poor part of New York. Drugs, prostitutes, junkies, abusive parents, alienation, and coping in spite of it all.  Find your passion. Channel your outrage. Put it to music. ",
