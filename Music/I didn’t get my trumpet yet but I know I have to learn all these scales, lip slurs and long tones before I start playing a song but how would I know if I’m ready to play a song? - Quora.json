            "answer_text": "Actually, no. There are plenty of fun melodies to play that don\u2019t take the full range or any special techniques. There are a few things you can play that don\u2019t even require the VALVES. A good course, however you are getting it \u2014 self-directed, tutor, book, online, whatever \u2014 will give you something you can actually play and enjoy in between all the long tone and scales and slotting and articulation and all those other rote exercises. You need the joy. You need to be able to play every now and then. And playing melody contextualizes the rest. It helps explain why you are doing that particular exercise, what it is trying to teach. And it will stretch you in ways you didn\u2019t expect or predict, and that, too, makes the exercises more focused and more meaningful.  Oh, and if you don\u2019t have the horn yet? Here\u2019s two things you can and should do right now that are going to help so much. Buzz. Just buzz your lips. Get used to it. See how consistent you can be, and how much you can change the pitch. Sure, working on breath control and diaphragm is also good but, really, the bang for the buck is the buzz. The other is learn to read. Learn theory \u2014 if you don\u2019t already. Even a little will help. It will make the lessons when you start trying to hit the right note a lot easier if you don\u2019t have to go back to the piano every time to figure out what the second line from the top on the treble stave actually means.

            "answer_text": "You don't have to know all those things to start having fun. Almost nobody begins learning an instrument with technique, the first step is to get a sound out of the thing and the second step is to have fun! After that, you can move into more structured technique, and learn all of your scales and the like, but I would personally first teach how to get a sound, how to get different (somewhat approximate) specific sounds called \"notes\" and give you a simple song you can play with just a few notes. Don't bore yourself to death and get stressed out before you even have an instrument. Have fun! ",
