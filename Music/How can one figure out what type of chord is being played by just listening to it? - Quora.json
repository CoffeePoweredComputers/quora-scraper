            "answer_text": "I'll preface this with the warning that reading this will be like drinking from a fire hose. Music theory is like math (literally, it uses the same part of the brain). You can't do much with a basic understanding of it. Functionality comes from practice, and it takes time. The piano is a great place to start, because notes are laid out in the most logical and conspicuous arrangement. I would get a music theory book or do some looking online to find the basic structure of a few chords.  That said, let's get started. Remember that distinguishing chords comes from a basic understanding of intervals. If you haven't learned intervals, this should come first. Assuming you know basic intervals, here are the chords you should memorize and practice (practice playing them in different keys, picking them out from songs you hear, have someone play the chords for you and guess which is played)  Major, and minor (major with the third lowered a half step) triads are the starting point with chords. (In a diminished triad, the third and fifth intervals are lowered a half step. This is a rarity in pop music).Seventh chords: (the \"7th\" refers to the interval between the base note and the top note that distinguishes a chord as a seventh chord) Dominant seventh: Major triad plus a minor 7thMajor seventh: Major triad plus a Major 7thMinor seventh: minor triad plus a minor 7thHalf-diminished seventh: diminished triad (minor triad with the 5th lowered a half step) plus a minor seventhFully-diminished seventh: diminished triad plus a diminished seventh interval (take the minor seventh interval and bring it another half step down).Ninth chords: Ninth chords are easer to distinguish once you've mastered the seventh chord game because they add a 9th interval to the mix (which is really the same as a 2nd interval, raised an octave.) For the ones I'll mention, quality is determined by the seventh chord under the 9th. Following are a few basic ones to get you started after you're comfortable with seventh cords.  Minor ninth: Minor seventh chord plus a major ninth (this is probably the only ninth chord you will really hear).Major ninth: Major seventh chord plus a major ninthDominant ninth: Dominant seventh chord plus a major ninth (doubt you'll need to know this one, but hey)(If you're ever playing jazz, an \"add 9\" refers to a triad plus a ninth, without the whole seventh chord deal. Most ninth chords, variations from what I've mentioned, and things like the half-diminished and fully-diminished sevenths, are not usually going to be heard much in pop music. But keep in mind there is far more to learn out there.) Picking chords out of songs you hear essentially comes down to two steps.  First, you need to listen the bassline. Chords can be played in different inversions, etc. Listen to what the bass is playing, so you can begin constructing the chord in your head to figure out what it is. The next step is to listen to the other notes being played and imagine them over the bass note. Generally you'll be able to distinguish major from minor easily based on the tone (as you put it, happy vs. sad). However, if you practice this enough, you'll be able to distinguish between the types of seventh (and ninth) chords that you might be hearing. Again, this takes time and lots and lots of practice.Cheers. ",

At 16, after I had been playing acoustic folk guitar for less than a year (without lessons other than the rankest-beginner Mel Bay book), I was able to figure out chord progressions for most songs I heard on the radio\u2014to the point where I was able to do so for my then-boyfriend\u2019s rock band. It doesn\u2019t take genius, years of study or even knowledge of theory (which I didn\u2019t even start studying till college). I could barely even sight-sing, a skill I got from high school choir. How did I learn ? By seeing the chord diagrams for each type of chord most likely to be encountered in the keys of C and G (printed above sheet music or in those Mel Bay primers), then playing them, and listening for the differences between them! I watched and listened to other players, and later watched the old PBS show \u201cFolk Guitar with Laura Weber.\u201d It was quite easy to extrapolate those tell-tale sound signatures to other keys once I\u2019d heard them over and over and committed them to memory. Mind you, I was not yet a \u201cgood guitarist,\u201d just a competent rudimentary one. Eventually, I picked up theory both by experience and formal study, and learned what the components of each type of chord were, intervals, Nashville-numbering, etc. But first I had to know what they sounded like, not what notes on the scale or staff were present in them. And there is NO substitute for listening!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Since this was in the \u201clearning to play guitar\u201d forum, and you wouldn\u2019t be asking this question if you were very experienced, I\u2019m going to give you a simple answer which isn\u2019t full of confusing music theory. The easiest way to figure out chords, is to go online and search for the song you\u2019re trying to play, to see if there\u2019s a posted version with chords and lyrics (so you can know where each chord goes by following the lyrics). And make sure it\u2019s chords and not tablature, which is similar but works differently. That\u2019s all there is to it and if you do this enough, you\u2019ll eventually start figuring it out yourself without having to find them online. However: If you want to figure it out for yourself, a fairly simple method is to play a single note on your top string that seems to match the sound of the chord. If the note you find is a \u201cG\u201d, then the chord is most likely a G of some sort as well. You\u2019ll have to determine whether or not it\u2019s a major, minor, or 7th by trying all three, but you\u2019ve done the hardest part already. If you\u2019re a beginner, there\u2019s little reason for you to worry about all the other chords at this point. Even 7ths aren\u2019t nearly as important as basic majors and minors. A good beginner\u2019s exercise is to try to discover them for yourself, and then look up a chord and lyrics chart online to see how close you were, or just learn what the key is in (more on this below) and figure it out from there. Do this a couple of times and you\u2019ll start to get the hang of it. Identifying chords takes some practice, so don\u2019t get discouraged. The good part is that if you spend 15 minutes trying to determine a certain chord, tomorrow might just take 5 minutes. And from there, it will just get easier and quicker. I can sometimes guess the majority of a song without having an instrument nearby. You\u2019ll also be learning a lot of other important stuff as you go along that\u2019s mostly related to music theory. Those things are important, but if you continue to learn the basics, at some point you\u2019ll be able to have someone teach you all of that other stuff and it will actually make sense instead of simply confusing you. Along with learning chords, also learn what a \u201cKey\u201d is. (Once you determine that first chord or two, you\u2019ll have a good idea what key the song is in.) Knowing the key automatically tells you what most of the chords will be, which will make it a lot easier to figure something out. A lot of beginner guitarists are playing classic rock or country. Most of those songs can be played with 3-5 chords and a lot of time they\u2019ll even be the same chords (singers tend to use only one or two keys throughout an entire album). Obviously, there are songs that have a lot more chords, but stick to the easier ones until you\u2019re ready. AC/DC, KISS, and other stuff like that is fairly easy for a beginner if you\u2019re playing classic rock, and older country (like Willie Nelson or George Jones) is easy if you\u2019re trying to play that style. Newer country is all over the place, so it\u2019s a little unpredictable as is most Pop music. Since you\u2019re at the beginner\u2019s stage, I\u2019ll give you a word of advice: spend only half your time on chords. Spend the other half on rhythm. You\u2019d be surprised how many musicians can play lead notes all over the neck but are terrible rhythm guitarists (this is common with most instruments). Their timing is simply bad. Remember that music is \u201cpitch\u201d (the note you\u2019re playing) and \u201crhythm\u201d (when you\u2019re playing that note). One isn\u2019t worth much without the other. As an exercise, find a simple song you like and play a recording of it. Play a single chord and see if you can match the rhythm of the song from one end to the other. If you can\u2019t, you need to keep doing this at least as much as you\u2019re practicing chords. And just like chords, there are nearly as many rhythms (and people will notice when you\u2019re playing them badly a lot quicker than they\u2019ll notice a bad chord.) Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "This is a bit tricky but you might want to give a shot. Listen for the bass notes. They are often the lowest note of the chord and they are often the most supportive note of the chord. When you can define (or play) the bass note, the next step is to decide whether it is a major or a minor chord. This part is easy, if the bass note is an E note then play an E major chord, if it sounds a bit sour then play an E minor chord. Stay away from 7th chords at first. The 3rd note of any chord has great power because it defines whether the chord is a major or a minor chord. The note name of the chord is not always the bass note. The 5th tone is often used as the bass note also. You can use this method to track down the chord tones. In the key of C, the note names are C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C. You can add numbers to the note names: 1C, 2D, 3E, 4F, 5G, 6A, 7B, 8C. Chord tones are the odd numbers (1, 3, 5, and 7. The 8th tone is a clone of the first note. Each note of the scale can become a root note. If you take each note of the C scale and place it as the first note you can create a model for all the chords of the C scale. Use the numbers to identify the notes of each start sequence. The first set is 1C to 8C the next is 1D to 8D, all the other notes follow this arrangement. When you want to find the chord for each set you only have to select the 1, 3, 5, and/or 7th notes to play all the chords in the C scale. Take your time to work this out because this system can applied to all the major scales and the minor scales contained within. Once you get the drift you won\u2019t want to stop using this method. Good luck! P.S. the chords of the C scale are as follows: Cmaj, Dmin, Emin, Fmaj, G, Amin, Bdim, and C. Each chord gets to be part of a scale within a scale! Go exploring! ",

            "answer_text": "When I was in middle school, about 8th grade, I had a little book called something like \"How to Write Rock 'n' Roll Music\" This would have been about 1968 or so.It was an epiphany to me, an eye-opener and the key to music. I wish I still had it, or could find it again. I've tried. This little book was essentially a theory primer - it talked about the basic construction of songs, what we call I, IV, V chords; often in the pattern of 1, 4, 1, 5seventh, 1 (Or C, F, C, G7, C), and how ubiquitous this is through popular music. Then it broadened it adding \"relative minors\" which are sort of like those chords and substitute for them, giving sort of a \"do-wap\" sound. Once you start to understand the structure (and early Rock, or even better, 12 bar blues is very pure on this harmonic structure) you start to hear it everywhere. Having a framework on which to hang the sounds makes it easy to understand what chord you are hearing. And then, like those \"relative minors\" you can start to hear variations from the pure framework, and diminished, augmented, 6ths, 9ths, etc. start to open up. Because you now have a context. At that time, I had taken piano for more years than I had been in school, and was a pretty new guitar player. But it was all just jumbled up bits of knowledge -do this, then do that until the end of the song.When I learned this little bit of theory, I started to be able to figure things out, to hear that structure, and hear the chords (even hear what the chords would be if there WERE chords!) in a completely new way. That little book rocked my world.A little theory can be a good thing. ",

Over time, if you actively exercise your ears and brain, you will come to distinguish the finer subtleties of chords. By \"actively exercise\" I mean: listen to a song repeatedly (internalization is a massive part of this)Find the chords as best you can (even if they are just minor and major for now). By find I mean, find them yourself on your instrument. Not Google it or use some tech to shortcut, because its the process of you doing it that will develop your earAllow yourself to then check tab/google it/ use tech to find one of the chords to confirm /check your answerIf your chord wasn't quite right, play yours and then play the correct chord and notice the differenceRepeatOften you can tell the diference between open chords and barre chords by the difference in sustain and interval order. Intervals in a open G for example are: Root, 3rd, 5th, root, 3rd, root While a barred version has: Root, 5th, root, 3rd, 5th, root. This ability along with many others centred around listening and identifying musical elements like chords, scales, riffs and melodies can be learned and honed with regular Ear Training practice. Once developed, your sharpened ability will mean you won't have to hunt around on your instrument to find chords, riff etc but know exactly where to put your fingers. ",

            "answer_text": "Each of those chords (minor 7, major 7, dominant 7th has a particular character based on the intervals contained within the chords. As others suggest, you should practice listening, singing and playing intervals to start. I also like the idea of associating a visual image/character to chords or associating them with a song I know well. For example, fully diminished chords sound like the bad guy tying the woman to the train tracks in old tv shows and the major minor seventh chord sounds like a detective working in a city filled with dark alleyways and dangerous criminals. Dominant seventh chords have a particular dissonance built in- a diminished fifth as a result of its major third and its flat seventh combined- when the third is flattened to a minor third, this dissonance goes away since the interval becomes a perfect fifth. You want to listen for this tension- minor seventh chords don't have much tension, especially when compared to a dominant seventh chord. Major seventh chords have more tension because the major seventh forms a minor second when voiced close to its root. It's also literally a major chord and a minor chord together (C major seventh is CEG and EGB combined for example) and to me sounds like wistful remembrances of a wonderful time in the past that can no longer happen again. Try to tell yourself a story with these sounds and recall the story when you hear those sounds later. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "I am not a music teacher, but this is how I learned from my guitar teacher and it helped put it all in perspective. The first step in understanding how a chord sounds is to understand how they are built. For example a major chord sounds \u201chappy\u201d because it is built off of the 1\u20133\u20135 intervals - otherwise known as a major triad. So to make a \u201cC\u201d chord you would use the notes C (1) - E(3) and G (5). I purposely used \u201cC\u201d in this example because the \u201cC\u201d intervals are the easiest to see. C (1) D(2) E(3) F(4) G(5) A(6) B(7) C (1 - Back to the Root). Remember that between B & C and E & F there are 1/2 steps so that confuses things a little bit when you build chords. Now that you know this, you can see where everywhere on the guitar neck or piano keyboard there is a C you can build a C chord very easily - just add the 3rd and 5th note. You can also build inversions or different variations of those chords. If you want to build a minor chord you have to use the 1 - 3(minor) - 5 intervals. Which means that in our \u201cC\u201d chord example you would use C(1) - EMinor(flat3) - G(5). That flatted (moved down a 1/2 step or 1 fret) third makes all of the difference in the world because that is what makes it \u201csad\u201d. Once you see how chords are built and do it yourself by adding 7ths, flat 7th\u2019s, 6th\u2019s and 9th\u2019s (otherwise known as \u201c2\u2019s\u201d because once you \u201cpass\u201d the 2 in the line up the interval you have to call it a 9th \u2014 11th\u2019s are just 4th\u2019s) you get to see where the sounds come from. For a Major 7 chord you would use 1 - 3 - 5 - 7. In a dominant 7th chord you would add a flat 7 (1 - 3 - 5 - minor7). That flatted 7th note adds such a unique sound that you will recognize it a lot easier once you hear it built into the major chord and you will hear it all over blues and rock. Throw in the 1 - flat3rd - 5 - flat7 and you now have a Minor 7th chord. Starting to get the picture? Don\u2019t forget the Devil\u2019s interval which is a flatted 5th - the ultimate \u201cnote\u201d in any \u201cMetal\u201d song - it will show you how just one note makes all the difference! The key to all of this is 1) knowing the intervals on your instrument. If you know the intervals it\u2019s not nearly as important to memorize the notes - you will learn them over time. If you know the notes and the intervals you are even better off. If you memorize all of the intervals (ex: minor 7 flat 5 = 1 - flat3 - flat5 - flat7) in all of the chord types (major / minor / dominant / 7th\u2019s / 9th\u2019s / 11th\u2019s + suspended and augmented chords and triads) and in all of the modes and scales (blues / harmonic minor) you will be a kick-ass musician because you will understand what is going on and won\u2019t be limited by playing stuff that you have just memorized. When you are jamming with other people and someone is playing rhythm you can move in and out and all around without playing the same chords that they are playing and can add extra spice. It takes years but when you get there you will be in the top 1%. I have attached the chord and interval chart that I made when I was trying to learn all of this stuff. Hope it helps! Intervals.pdf ",

            "answer_text": "There are many ways to approach this, and some great answers here. I especially like Tali's suggestion of working with stripped down intervals. Pretty important if you want to get deep into hearing chords. Since you ask about hearing chord extensions, I think it might help to frame your listening exercises with a little chord theory. Essentially this is a framework for doing the interval work that Tali recommends. Let's start with a relatively dense chord: Cmaj7#11 1 - 3 - 5 - 7 - #11 (intervals)C - E - G - B - F# (pitches)Here we can group the chord tones into two main groups: stable tones and color tones. This helps us break up a complex harmony into discernible parts, so we can take it one bite at a time. Stable tones define the chord. Cmaj7#11 is just a C major chord with a few added tones. The intervals which build a C major chord - 1, 3, 5 - are stable tones. Stable tones ground the harmony, and color tones only make sense when played with (against) a set of stable tones. Color tones add flavor. They combine in subtle and diverse ways. It helps to think about color tones on a continuum from consonant to dissonant. In the case of Cmaj7#11, 7 and #11 are both color tones, but the 7th sounds more consonant than the #11. The #11 sounds considerably more \"outside.\"  So, here's how you learn to hear a complex chord like Cmaj7#11. First, you must learn to hear the stable tones and how they relate to each other. Start with interval pairs. Learn to hear 1 & 3, 3 & 5, 1 & 5. Then work with 3 note voicings. Stacking these intervals on guitar is a lot of fun. You'll amaze yourself with the many ways you can play a C major chord: 1, 3, 53, 5, 15, 1, 3etc.Once you can hear the stable tones, then you can learn to hear color tones in order from consonant to dissonant. The common consonant color tones you'll encounter are 7, 6, 9. Dissonant color tones are more varied, but it's good to start with b9, #9, #11. A note about learning color tones. Learn them one interval at a time. It's much easier to distinguish Cmaj7 from C7 than it is to distinguish Cmaj7#11 from C7#11. Why? Cmaj7 and C7 have only 4 notes, and 3 in common. The only difference is the 7th, which is flattened in a C7 chord (C-E-G-Bb). Once you can hear a C chord, it's not too difficult to distinguish C7 & Cmaj7. Cmaj7#11 and C7#11 each contain 5 notes, offering more possible inversions and interval combinations. There's a lot of tension: 7 against 1, #11 against 1, #11 against 7. But if you start with Cmaj7 and C7 it's not so bad. Once you can hear those chords, and you can hear a #11 interval against the root... then it's only a little more practice before you can call out a Cmaj7#11 in your sleep! ",

            "answer_text": "It's actually something that comes quite easily with practice. The thing is, unless you have perfect pitch, musicians wouldn't immediately know the exact chord that is being played. I'll walk you through the thought process that can easily distinguish the chord progression of a song. A major scale has 7 notes (8 if you count the very last repeated note). Think \u201cDo - Re - Mi\u201d. Each of these notes can be associated with a number 1\u20137. If you never use a note that is outside of these 7 notes of the scale (which is very noticeable if you do), you will only have 7 chords to choose from. Of these 7 chords, a few of them are rather irrelevant. One specific chord is the 7th chord (in the key of C, it would be B diminished\u2026 you won't find this chord on the radio 99.9% of the time). So that leaves just 6 chords to choose from. Of these 6, there are 4 that are very common. The 1, 4, 5, and 6. Here's the catch - you wouldnt be able to know \u201cthis is a G chord\u201d unless you knew the key of the song. So, knowing the key is actually the first step. Without that, you're just as in the dark as anyone else (again, unless you have perfect pitch). Now, you just need to train your ear to be able to identify the intervalic differences in these chords. As simple as I can put it, the 5 chord naturally pulls to the 1 chord (or to the 6 chord.. but this is called a deceptive cadence because it technically does resolve, but not in the way you thought it would). The 6 chord sounds minor, and the four chord typically leads to the 4. None of these things are necessarily \u201crules\", they just help identify where a song is going. ",

I perhaps situate myself in the \"people who do\" get music. But not \"really do\" because I don't understand the mechanics, the technicalities of it. Yes I know that a major key is different from a minor key and that only a specific set of chords belong to an E Major Key which is different from playing in the B Minor Key.   But look: One of my favorite \"go to\" songs is Taylor Swift's \"Our Song\" and I just happen to know that the song begins with a D Major chord. So, if I am out in the car listening to a song, or just trying to pick out a song, I could pick up a D Major just simply because I recognize it.  And the best part is, you can do this with all the chords! But if I were you, I would start out simple, starting with the less complex chords such as D, Em, Am, G, and slowly build your list of chords you can recognize.  Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Chords happen in context. As a musician, I don't think much about individual chords anymore - I think about sequences of chords, that follow the Circle of Fifths and other common rules of harmony, and creating those harmonic motions via voice leading. So if I hear a iim7-V7-I sequence, I know that middle chord is a dominant seventh, by its function. From there, I learn things like how it sounds if altered - say, IIb9-V+7-I (Dflat9 to Gaugmented7 to C, for example). By hearing the core function automatically, I can learn to pick out the alterations and substitutions.  It's hard to explain this without experiencing it. It's like asking \"How do you know which words to put together to make a sentence?\" When you start, you think of notes, so you're thinking of letters. Then you move to chords, and you're thinking of words. I'm talking about thinking in sentences.  And when I'm playing music seriously and well, I'm not even thinking sentences. I'm thinking paragraphs, or pages. Isolating a single chord from a stream of structured music is like isolating a single word from a page of music and wondering what it means. Every word is important (hopefully), but not every word has significance outside the context of the page. ",

            "answer_text": "I want to answer this as concisely as possible. I started taking lessons at age 9 and have learned several musical instruments over the course of 21 years. I am a recording artist with 11 albums and I\u2019ve opened a music lesson business, teaching locally from a brick and mortar, as well as online. My first tip is avoiding gurus and any method that promises what seems like you\u2019ll gain magical ear-powers. My second tip is to practice a musical instrument for life and expect to always be getting better. If your practicing is sincere and you are being honest with yourself, with rational expectations, you must trust you are getting better like you trust your hair is growing (i.e. you will not necessarily see it happening, at least not all the time). Tip three is to learn musical theory. This is one of the hardest things, only because most books are written pretentiously and/or the authors write in a manner to avoid criticism from other professors or to impress, and many teachers want to be gurus who\u2019s status is dependent on being the only one \u201cin the know\u201d. Learning music theory should be fun and exciting to an aspiring musician/artist. Tip four is to take mental note of chords that sound cool to you when you play them - if you hear a chord that sounds cool to you in a song, learn it - and identify at least the chord type by name. Later study the context of the chord (i.e. how it relates to the chords around it.) I also recommend singing the intervals in chords you are studying. Tip five is to only try learn learn one chord type at a time. If you are trying to identify Maj7 chords and you are using a random chord generator, ask yourself merely whether the chord you hear is Maj7 or not. Don\u2019t try to internalize the sound every chord at once and then expect yourself to be able to distinguish between them. Bonus tip - This is a life pursuit. There is no finish line. Understand that this is good news! ",

I don\u2019t really know any theory. I can usually find a chord pretty quickly and this is how I do it. First of all I can tell if it\u2019s a major (happy) minor (sad) 7th (funky) minor 7th (funky sad) easily. Then I find a root note on the 6th or 5th string and play a couple of barre shapes on that fret. If its a chord with an add9 or a 5th or something weird i just kind of find it. This works for about 95% of chords in most music other than jazz. Those jazz guys are crazy with the weird chords. The other 5% I sometimes have to admit defeat and google it. I know quite a lot of players who do it like this, and one or two of them are really great guitarists who make their living from it, but really it\u2019s better to understand the theory like Jake Doering is saying.

            "answer_text": "Many individuals have offered some really great answers. My answer is quite simple. I learned to recognize the type of chord I\u2019m hearing by reading jazz charts, playing the chords represented by the chord symbol (C, F#m7, Abmaj7, Bb6/9, etc.), and over time, associating the symbol with the sound coming from my instrument. One can learn organically by seeing a chord symbol, playing the chord it represents on one\u2019s instrument, and hearing the sound it makes. Of course, this takes patience and time to become proficient at it. It\u2019s not unlike learning to read aloud. You see a word on the page, someone pronounces it for you, you hear the pronunciation of the word, and try to reproduce it with your own voice. In time, you see the word on the page and you know what it will sound like when you read it. Similarly, you hear a word spoken, and you know how that word will look in written form. Hope that helps.

Some examples:Dom#9 - The main riff from Purple Haze by Jimi HendrixMaj7 - I picture the cliche lounge jazz performerDom7 - The turn-around in a 12-bar bluesMaj6 - The end of lots of Beatles songs As Stephen said, start with the easy ones and gradually get more complex.  As you're playing with the chord, create a visual picture in your head of what the chord sounds like.  Whatever that is to you.  Maybe a 13 chord sounds \"partly cloudy with a chance of rain\".  Those visual connections help immensely. You might also do the same thing individual intervals.  A lot of time, being able to hear the correct intervals in the melody will clue you in to what the underlying chord is.  Here's some tips on that: How to Learn Intervals by Ear ",

            "answer_text": "The shortest answer to that will be ear training. Learn to recognize the root note of the chord and the notes which follow it. Learn your intervals (they're probably the simplest part of ear training) and try to associate the notes you hear with the intervals. Learn how chords are constructed (example 1-3-5 for major, 1-b3-5 for minor) and spend some time familiarising yourself with how they sound. You mentioned earlier that you can already recognize major and minor chords. If you listen carefully you'll find that most chords are similar to them with a few extra notes.  Say someone asks you to distinguish between an augmented and a diminished chord. You can think of it as 'an augmented chord has a higher note attached to the major chord while a diminished has a lower note'. Listen to these chords and you'll know what I mean. Train your ear well :) ",

So there were not simple triads, they were fairly complex extended chords. Turns out my friends mom, a violinist, had perfect pitch. We asked her to help us figure out the chords. She listened once, writing down the chords complete with all tensions. She listened a second time, she only had to change one chord\u2019s extensions, and that was that. I was beyond impressed. She did not have to try them out on piano, but we did to check her and if she was wrong it was so close that we could \u2019t tell. I mean she listed the inversions in the piano part! Pretty darned cool. She could also tell you what notes the door bell or car door chime was, and if they were a little sharp or flat. ",

I just want to add that distinguishing notes, intervals and chords Is using your ears to interpret sound wavelengths in the same way that distinguishing color is using your eyes to interpret light wavelengths. So it is possible to have disorders (like color blindness) that makes it more difficult to distinguish. But as other responders have indicated, there are great ways to train your ears and brain, and thousands of music students have to do it every year to pass their music theory classes. That was one of my favorite subjects in high school and college, because my mom helped me train from a very young age. So a lot of those exercises and skills came more easily than they would have if I had tried to learn it all as a young adult. ",

I play Old Country and gospel and some rockabilly and they usually just use three to four chords maybe a fifth one in there the fourth and fifth ones are usually minors, hope this helps. Usually music is in ABC's if you start off in A then you skip two letters in the alphabet and your next two letters areD&E your next chords, if you start off in G you start over in a in the alphabet so you skip a and b you skipped two letters in the alphabet you're next two letters are your next chords. So on and so forth . Not counting the flats. It's actually pretty simple once you start doing this your fourth chord I call this my off cord is usually the next letter in the alphabet after the third, try it it works. Just try it! I'm tired of editing it ",

It\u2019s like children learn language and grammar \u2013 not by reading grammar books, but by listening to people talking until they get a \u201cfeel\u201d for what it is they hear. I do harmonic analysis videos of current pop songs on YouTube: Real World Music Theory Channel . This can be a fun way to develop the \u201cfeeling\u201d for chords. Also be sure to try to play with songs you hear \u2013 it might not be perfect in the beginning, but you will learn pretty quickly. ",

Then \u201cflat the 3rd\u201d to play A, C, and E. That\u2019s an A minor chord. Play that up and down, and of course all together, and learn what a minor chord sounds like. Minor chords are typically \u2018sad\u2019 chords. Almost anything Russian sounds sad. (usually was) Major chords are happy chords. There are other notes like the 7 and 9, and of course a million others. This chord structure will apply to any instrument. Music is music. Enjoy! ",
