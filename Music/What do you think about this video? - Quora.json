            "answer_text": "My initial thoughts on this video was, \"where is he going with his rants\".  He's talking about depression and its symptoms but it didn't seem like it was coming to a conclusion. Then it started. He listed all the things that someone should do when encountering someone with depression.  Taking the time to be selfless instead of selfish is the one thing that a person suffering from depression needs most.  They don't need comfort or a conversation; they don't need to eat or hang out with friends.  The man in video is 100% correct in that a depressed person doesn't know what they want because the internal pain is too great sometimes to be able to think straight.  Knowing that someone is around (sometimes means not in the same room) to listen when it's time to talk is the best thing for a depressed person.  Understanding how to act (and react) around a depressed person is what this video offers.  There were plenty of ideas/options given that someone can offer their depressed friend/family member; hopefully the one option by the depressed person that is taken is the one where he says, \"I will stay here until you're ready to face the world together.\" All in all, I rate this video a 9.8696 (pi squared) out of 10.

He is not giving a ton of crap and then asking for only $19.95, he is not paddling any snake oil. He is not a Jesus freak. He is a good guy. I think any company would do well for themselves hiring this guy. ",
