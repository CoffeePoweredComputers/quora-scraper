            "answer_text": "The company that represents BTS probably assumed that it's safer to unfollow him because it might attract negative press from the west Multiple media organizations tried to discredit Pewdiepie and several other Youtubers. There are several reasons for this: 1.Legacy media is losing viewers, money and trust at a ridiculous rate, several media outlets had to close down because of this. The viewers are more attracted to online platforms like Youtube and Pewdiepie being the biggest Youtuber is also one of the biggest competitors for them. 2.Most Youtubers don\u2019t push the same narative and political agenda the media is payed to push, discrediting the other party is in their interest. 3. Pewdiepie criticized in the past news organizations for pushing fake news. 4. Outragious articles get more traffic. The smear against Pewdiepie is verifiably fake, if you want to check that i strongly suggest you watch/read both the article and his video mentioned in the article to make up your own mind. Back to the point! To BTS, following or unfollowing him is a small deal (especially since Pewdiepie never mentioned if he is or isn't a fan of them) but having the western press target them for it can become a big deal. The safest option is simply to unfollow him. ",

            "answer_text": "I know its too late to answer this, but i saw Pewds video on Kpop , and i realized although he said he likes them (their visuals , choreo, cool attitude) he said he personally dont like their songs because he cant relate to them and he finds the visuals cool, (that doesnt mean he cant be a fan) I think its pretty clear that BTS always try to emphasis on the fact that, they although like being called Handsome and Oppa they wanna be known for their songs and the message they carry rather than just being visuals, probably because of this reason either the members (pretty unlikely because it must have been one of them that started following him in first place ) or their Company had unfollowed him . And also at that time BTS was getting internationally recognized and Pewds was getting into controversy , if one thing any Korean Boy Band will avoid at all cost is Scandal and Pewdiepie was infamous for that at that time . Honestly its no big deal and i have no idea why am ranting about this here. ",
