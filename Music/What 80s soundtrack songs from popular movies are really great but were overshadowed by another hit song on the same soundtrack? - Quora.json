            "answer_text": "Ok. Well I seem to remember a film that had a song that overshadowed other decent songs on the same soundtrack.  Beverly Hills Cop. It actually had several good songs. But the one that stood out the most from this film didn\u2019t even have lyrics. Axel F performed by Harold Faltermeyer. This song was huge in the mid 80s. It was played all the time. It\u2019s still probably the most recognized song from the film. And it\u2019s instrumental. Keyboards only.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx2gvHjNhQ0 Other good songs that got air time are\u2026 The Heat is On by Glenn Fry.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uZD8HKVKneINeutron Dance by the Pointer Sistershttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SOscjUHPY-oNew Attitude by Patti Labell.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QWfZ5SZZ4xEThese three songs still got decent airtime. But Axel F is the most well known. One great song that got lost in the shuffle was Gratitude by Danny Elfman. At the time he was still part of Oingo Boingo. Gratitude was a catchy song and is better than the song Weird Science, which is probably Oingo Boingo\u2019s most well known song, followed by Dead Man\u2019s Party\u2026.a Halloween favorite. Gratitude was an 80\u2019s alternative dance tune which should be more recognized today. It\u2019s one of Oingo Boingo\u2019s best songs. But Weird Science and Dead Man\u2019s Party tend to suck all the air out of the room. Gratitude was also on the soundtrack and was actually my favorite song to listen to. I played it over and over again. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0_nDVjykgDk ",
