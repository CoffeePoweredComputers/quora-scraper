            "answer_text": "As a Christian is__ bad? This answer (blank) should be applied to every aspect of a Christian life. I\u2019ve mentioned this stuff before in previous answers, but it's very important in my Christian life, so I'm going to repeat some. My number one goal, as a Christian is get to heaven.How do you get to heaven? This is done by following God. What draws you away from God? Sin. What is sin? This is when you go against God, by not following his commandments. \u201cThe 10 Commandments List, Short Form* You shall have no other gods before Me.You shall not make idols.You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain.Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.Honor your father and your mother.You shall not murder.You shall not commit adultery.You shall not steal.You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.You shall not covet\u201dCommandments List These are examples of what commandments can be broken during Halloween. 1,2.Dressing up as a monster, the devil, or listening to scary music are not of God. Neither is dressing up as fictional characters from books, or movies or fairys. These come from a different world other than God. 4,5,9. Your parents tell you to go to church on Sunday. You lie to your parents, that you are going to church. You skip church to go trick or treating. That's not what God wants. 6. Are you making fun of someones costume? That's not of God. 7. Do you have lustful thoughts towards someones costume. 8,3. Stealing each others candy without their consent (trades ect) is not of God. Do you curse after someone steals your candy? That's not of God. 10. Having a feeling of jelousy, about how someone got more candy then you, is not what God wants. This is what God wants. The Bible says,\u201cIt is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\" Matthew 19:24. Do you have a lot of costumes sitting around that no one ever wears. This is not of God. Do you have a large bag of candy, while Jimmy didn't get any? This is not of God. God wants us to give the costumes to the poor. He doesn't want us to sell them on E-bay ect. Share with Jimmy. God will give you many blessings, because of your good deeds. \u201cTell all the congregation of Israel that on the tenth day of this month every man shall take a lamb according to their fathers\u2019 houses, a lamb for a household.4And if the household is too small for a lamb, then he and his nearest neighbor shall take according to the number of persons; according to what each can eat you shall make your count for the lamb.5Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old. You may take it from the sheep or from the goats, 6and you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month, when the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill their lambs at twilight.\u201d I'm not saying you have to kill any animals, and hanget them on your door post. God\u2019s message is that you should give up your best possessions. Don't just give Jimmy the candy that you don't like. Maybe you and Jimmy\u2019s favorite candy bar is the twix. Share some twixes with Jimmy. Give up some your favorite costumes. You probably will end up getting sick, if you eat all the candy. You may curse, and or miss church, because of it, ect. Did you give up candy for Lent, and choose to eat it anyways. Did you eat candy an hour before church? Did you go trick-or treating on Saturday and you have to get all your chores done on Sunday. This is not what God wants. Also, you might miss church, because you can\u2019t find your church clothes, because your room is a mess, ect. Does this diry room cause others to judge your dirty room?\u2026 Say your a parent and you make an angel costume for your kid. Your kid screams. I don't want to be an angel. I want to be Batman. Again, not God\u2019s kingdom. If someone ask you what are you dressed as? You say, Batman. Someone might Google Batman and learn about a kingdom other then God. What are you dressed as? An angel. Someone might Google, or Quora and learn about God's kingdom. Your planting the wrong seeds in peoples minds. Actually, your just planting weeds. The weeds are taking over God\u2019s fruits in heaven. I spent all of my time, money and hard work into making this costume, and no one appreciates it, said the parent. God noticed, and appreciates you trying to spread the good word, God\u2019s word, and, that's all that matters. Don't walk up to the other parents, and say did you see that awesome costume I made for my kid. That's not what God wants. Don't brag. Be humble. I'm not answering this question to try, and just judge everyone. Maybe I\u2019m hypocritical with this answer. For a long time I didn't know these were all sins. I am a sinner. I make mistakes. Every time I sin hang Jesus right back on the cross. Now that I know that these are sins, if my goal is to get to heaven, then I need to think before I act. I go to Reconciliation to get rid of my sins. Reconciliation is a gift from God, that helps prevents me, and everyone from sinning . I invite you to do the same. Halloween is supposed to celebrate All Saints Day. (Saints of God\u2019s Kingdom in Heaven, angels, or saints, and, not monsters, or scary ghost ect of the devils kingdom in hell.) Is Halloween bad? It depends on how you your family, community, friends celebrate it. Pros: Relationships. You get the chance to talk to people that you may never talk to without the holiday. When people go trick-or treating, you nock on and someones door and say trick or treat, in the hopes that you get candy. It's a time for parents, to spend time with their children, and children can spend time with their parents, or friends. As a parent, show your children that the real treat is all of God's blessing from heaven. Pros: People may dress up, as angels and saints, and you get a taste of heaven on earth. This isn't make believe. We are bringing God's kingdom to earth which is what God wants for us. Cons: Relationships: It may be dangerous to nock on a strangers door, because you don't know their intentions. Cons: Most costumes don't represent God's kingdom. ",

            "answer_text": "I was raised in the South (yes, with a capital \"S\"), and I went Trick-or-Treating every year. We were Baptist, then Methodist. The Baptist church I attended for half my life condemned Halloween as the Devil's holiday and the like. But my parents, who are pretty religious overall, never agreed with that sentiment. Neither do I.  We don't make sacrifices to the devil on Halloween. We don't actually believe that we wear costumes to ward off evil spirits. That's the thing. Halloween was a pagan holiday. People would wear masks to confuse the evil spirits and make them go and haunt and bother someone else.  To some uniformed Christians, pagan means Satan worshiping. Not true. Pagan theology is completely different than Christian theology. Just because the Pagans weren't Christians doesn't mean they were devil worshipers. (Well, depending on your brand of Christianity, it might. But I wouldn't call Jewish people Satan worshipers for not being Christian, so why would I call any other non-Christian a Satan worshiper?)   The point is, we don't observe Halloween as a ritual. We give no thanks to the devil. The Christian devil has never been involved in the holiday at all, and even if he ever was, he certainly isn't now. It's about getting to dress up and get candy. ",
