            "answer_text": "I assume you know what modes are, but just in case: modes are scales derived from cycling the \u2018major scale\u2019, which then became known as Ionian, the first mode. Minor and major aren\u2019t modes, but tonalities. Not scales, but harmonic concepts. Yes, they are built from the aeolian and ionian modes, respectively, but belong to what\u2019s called tonal music. Tonal harmony has evolved considerably over history, and now those tonalities have expanded far wider than the scales they were based on. Even the classical period, when the tonal system had just been born, you could find off-scale notes; today, those are just as common as in-scale ones. The tonal system isn\u2019t the only harmonic system. Speaking of western music alone, you also have modal music, which is truly based on modes and uses all seven modes and not only ionian and aeolian. And even then, a modal ionian song is built on a whole different logic than a tonal major song on the same key. You also have Schoenberg\u2019s atonal (dodecaphonic) system and its variants, you have wonderful composers like Debussy who explored \u2018post-tonality\u2019\u2026 and if you move away from our Western tradition, you\u2019ll find more and more stuff. For example, some kinds of middle-eastern music don\u2019t even divide the octave in twelve equal semitones like we do; for a Western theorist, they would appear to be using \u2018quarter-tones\u2019, fractions smaller than the smallest unit we use in our system. And though that may seem complicated and sound strange to our ears, it probably comes rather naturally to someone raised in that culture. Always remember that in music, practice came first. Theory was created to describe and systematize the practice, and even then, that\u2019s OUR practice. Music is art, and as art it is both cultural and subjective. ",

            "answer_text": "No. There is a set of seven modes based off of the notes of the major scale, mentioned in several other answers. It is also possible to derive sets of modes off of the various minor scales (harmonic, melodic ascending & descending, etc.), off of any of the twelve chromatic notes, and by combining any two of the Greek tonoi. Beyond that, there are other scales, some of which are microtonal, meaning that they contain notes other than the Western twelve chromatic notes and/or intervals other than 100 cent half-steps.

            "answer_text": "The way we now use the word \u2018mode\u2019 in conventional music it means a set of seven notes within the compass of an octave, with together comprise a \u2018scale\u2019 or progressive sequence. The melodic spacing between successive notes is either a tone or a semitone - and the sequence of tones and semitones is what defines a particular mode or type of scale However, I\u2019m sure you will have already identified that there are 12 semitones in an octave. As our scale usually comprises 7 notes there are clearly a great many possible permutations to select 7 out of 12 In Western music, for the last 400 years the most popular scales have been those we no call \u2018major\u2019 and \u2018minor\u2019 (remembering there are two sorts of minor scale - melodic and harmonic.) However, in medieval times other scales were more popular for various cultural reasons. These scales have survived, principally but not exclusively in some types of folk music and religious music. It\u2019s quite easy to find folk songs and hymns in the old modes. In such times the common modes were what are now called \u2018Dorian\u2019, \u2018Aeolian\u2019 and \u2018Mixolydian\u2019. The first two have a minor \u2018feel\u2019 and the latter has a major \u2018feel.\u2019 Have a look here: Mode (music) - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "There are 7 modes in Western music (i.e. the one that uses the 12-tone chromatic scale that we generally accept as the standard). These are called (in order), Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian and Locrian. To derive these modes, take the major scale (for simplicity, let\u2019s just use C Major, or CDEFGAB). Ionian is the same as the major scale; it starts from scale degree 1. Dorian would be DEFGABC. Same notes as the major scale, but it starts from scale degree 2. Phrygian would be EFGABCD. And so on. While Ionian and Aeolian correspond to the major and natural minor scales, you can technically say all modes are major or minor, depending on if the 3rd scale degree (of that particular mode) is natural or flat (with respect to the major scale). Therefore, Ionian, Lydian and Mixolydian are major modes; Dorian, Phrygian, Aeolian and Locrian are minor modes. If you want to get outside \u201cmajor\u201d and \u201cminor\u201d completely, then you\u2019ll have to go into atonal music, where modes are irrelevant, or microtonal music, where funky things like \u201cneutral 3rds\u201d exist.
