            "answer_text": "One time I did the math on myself (here - Trini Cariaga's answer to On average, how many hours do you listen to music each day (excluding the music that you listen to in the car) and figured out that I listen to (on average) around 9+ hours of music on school/work days and around 14\u201316+ hours of music a day on off days or holidays. Listening to music is a common interest for many people and a lot of us (especially those of us who use music for escapism and to stay focused) can listen to a lot of it throughout the day. It\u2019s normal to listen to music as much as you want. Especially if it inspires you, makes you happy or feel validated, makes you feel encouraged, and keeps you focused. It can even serve as a temporary form of therapy and give you a sense of catharsis about whatever is going on in your life. Music is the one good drug we can\u2019t overdose on.     There\u2019s nothing wrong with you and it\u2019s not weird. ",

            "answer_text": "It is never weird to listen to music for 6 hours everyday. I'm a musician though, so perhaps I can relate to your predilection a little more than Joe average. Music obviously speaks to you on many levels and makes you happy inside and helps you in the process of dealing with life's numerous and recurring stresses. Music can help replenish you emotionally and is a medium that helps you understand your feelings/emotions and gives outwardly expression to them. Music is an aural drug that amplifies how your feeling or it can be a powerful mood changer as well. ",
