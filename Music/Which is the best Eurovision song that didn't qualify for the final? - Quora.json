            "answer_text": "My two biggest \u201cwe was robbed\u201d moments, I think, are Andorra\u2019s \u201cSalvem el mon\u201d by the punk band Anonymous, and Estonia\u2019s \u201cVerona\u201d by Koit Toome and Laura P\u00f5ldvere. The former doubles as Andorra\u2019s best entry by a very long margin, and should absolutely have made the final. I can\u2019t help thinking of the sign which appeared during the broadcast of the final that year asking \u201cWhere\u2019s Andorra????\u201d The latter was undone - I maintain - via a microphone malfunction during one of the harmonies. I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m biased, since I would happily pay good money to hear Koit Toome sing anything, but I still feel they should have pressed for another chance at performing and may have got through. I have a much longer list of national final entries which never made it even as far as a semi-final if one happened to be on offer. ",
