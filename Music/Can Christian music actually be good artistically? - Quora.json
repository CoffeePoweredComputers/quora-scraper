            "answer_text": "What type of Christian Music are you asking about? Christian Music dates back over 2,000 years and has been composed across a multitude of cultures and a variety of settings/styles. There is certainly abundance of wonderful choral and classical music that is drawn from Christian themes by composers like Palestrina, Mauchaut, Daufay, Josquin; as well as Handel, Haydn, Brahms, Bruckner, Bach; and more modern composers like Arvo Part, John Taverner. There are amazing choral groups like the Tallis Singers, Chanticleer, Hilliard Ensemble who perform a significant amount of sacred music. If you scan the globe you will also find some amazing musicians and songwriters creating Christian music in Kenya, Uganda, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, China, Russia, Ireland, Colombia and the like. My sense is that you are alluding to Christian Contemporary Music (CCM)? Here too there are some good musicians and groups creating modern Christian music. It\u2019s not always what you are going to here of pop Christian radio stations. But you can find some interesting and well crafted worship and Christian recordings by the likes of: Gungor, The Brilliance, Enter the Worship Circle, Sojourn, Red Mountain Church, Rivers & Robots, Bifrost Arts and others.
