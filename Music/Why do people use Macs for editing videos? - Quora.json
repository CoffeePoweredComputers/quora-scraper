            "answer_text": "Not everyone does - plenty of people in the world use Windows for video editing and there\u2019s absolutely nothing to stop you. It comes down to personal preference at the end of the day. I use Macs because they\u2019re better than PCs ;) That\u2019ll probably ruffle a few feathers I\u2019m sure, but it\u2019s ludicrous to even compare the two really being that a Mac is an entire computer and Windows is a bit of software that runs (predominantly) on computers that are hacked together using the cheapest possible components (you have to be a computer nerd to even stand a chance at getting compatible hardware that works well together). Personally speaking I\u2019ve been on both sides of the fence - I used to be in the \u201cMacs are for posers, they\u2019re expensive because they look shiny\u201d camp. This was fuelled by the fact that my art college had macs - I used them like once, it was confusing because they are different, plus they were a bit old and slow. Then in 2008 I actually bought and used a Mac, and I haven\u2019t really looked back. The thing is the \u2018shininess\u2019 extends all the way through the entire system, the operating system is so much more user friendly than Windows and Macs are extremely robust as well (this is evidenced by the fact that I am currently typing on the very same 2008 Macbook Pro). The fact they are so hassle free is really a plus when you\u2019re doing creative work - you don\u2019t wanna be f***ing around with installing drivers or getting blue screen of death every five seconds (which sums up my experience of PCs). Because Macs work so well without you having to think about it, and Apple has a strong \u2018design\u2019 focus, it makes sense that they are the go to computers for the creative industries. Seriously - it it were up to Microsoft, computer operating systems would still look like this:  How Steve Jobs' Love of Simplicity Fueled A Design Revolution Since Macs are so popular among designers and creative people, you\u2019ll find that a lot of creative apps are made solely for Mac. This is another reason they\u2019re used more frequently for things like video editing, and in fact this is the reason I had to switch in the first place (because certain apps were only available on Mac). Not only that, the development of Macs was always heavily tied in with the development of digital post production, so there us a long history of the two being intertwined. Oh and of course - you can install Windows on a Mac, and it will probably work better than on any PC. ",

            "answer_text": "Well I don\u2019t think people use Apple Macintosh computers for video editing more than they use PCs anymore. Once upon a time, they most certainly did. Avid Media Composer was a Mac-only application until 1999. For a few years after that, PC based systems were somewhat rare. However, over the last seventeen years, post-production companies in all of the major areas of TV production have shifted many more suites over to PCs. There are bound to be several thousand edit suites in London. I reckon probably only 15% run on Apple Macs now. Avid Media Composer on PCs is slightly slicker in my opinion and it certainly has fewer bugs. The industry\u2019s reasons for moving over to PC systems stems from various factors; the cost of workstations, the ease of support and the stability of the operating system. However\u2026 Now I don\u2019t want to get into a boring debate of the merits / drawbacks of Macs, but the concept of Apple Macs being more expensive per unit of performance is a myth and one that geeks like me are tired of proving. I still own a Mac Pro at home for running Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects etc. I have a 2008 eight-core machine with 24GB ram that I bought on eBay for \u00a3425 at the start of this year. A bargain. I\u2019ve owned lots of Macs since I discovered how simple they were to configure for pro audio and video back in the late 90s. I, like lots of creative people think the GUI is far more elegant and the user experience far better - an attitude that has for twenty years meant that I\u2019m mystified by Microsoft\u2019s inability to make windows not look shit and feel clunky. So as a consumer, I have historically much preferred Apple Macs. I know that millions of film makers and musicians from all over the world agree with me. They were easier to use, stayed technically feasible for longer and were much easier to configure with professional hardware without a nightmare of IRQs, and hardware conflicts. Also, Apple bought an unfinished video editing system from Macromedia in the late 90s and a few years later it became FCP. FCP, before version X, was a quite good and easy-to-learn editing system. For millions of film makers it provided an affordable and scalable alternative to Avid Media Composer and Media 100. It was great. Times were good. Now eventually Apple tired of their strategy of using pro users to inspire other people to own expensive, highly specced Macs, that they probably didn\u2019t need. Apple wanted to sell everyone flat panel iMacs, phones and bigger phones with no GSM - iPads. You cannot really do professional work on an iPad\u2026 Apple also realised that their core target market were aspirational film makers, not actual film makers. So they canned development of their troublesome, 32-bit, old FCP and promoted a powerful version of iMovie to the FCP brand. Let\u2019s not go there. We all left. Anyway, somewhere along the way, Microsoft had been delivering steadily more and more stable versions of Windows. Avid had been putting more time into the PC version of Media Composer. Now by 2008 / 2009, far more Avid Media Composer suites were running on PCs. These days, when I\u2019m doing my main day job, which is editing broadcast TV programmes, it is fairly rare that I work on an Apple Mac. I did one Discovery Channel programme in August on a Mac, but that was one of the first for a while. The PBS series I\u2019ve been on for much of the year was all on PCs. The Science Channel programme I\u2019m working on right now is on a PC. As I said at the beginning, I prefer Avid on PCs. I groan when I see a Mac in a pro edit suite now. We just don\u2019t need Apple anymore. They don\u2019t seem to want us either. Even QuickTime, whose video system has been the bedrock of nearly all professional non-linear editing software for over 25 years is probably about to end. Apple has decided to quit the support for the PC. I\u2019m not even sure I can be bothered to buy another Mac to run Adobe CS on at home. Perhaps the only reasons are that: All the software I currently own is OSXThey are rather nice shiny productsI can\u2019t think of anything else\u2026So, in conclusion, I think your statement \u201cWhy do people use Macs for editing videos?\u201d was true. Film makers like me did use Macs. They were unquestionably better tools. We (there are millions of us) made Apple look cool. We made hundreds of thousands of films and records on Apple Macs and made your statement true. But I think that idea is dead. ",
