            "answer_text": "I'd have to say yes he is. He has been going strong for over thirty years and his parodies are (almost) always fresh. He also is one of the few (if not the only) parodist who has become a benchmark in and of himself. Many artists consider it a mark of success if he parodies their songs. He almost always gets permission from the original artist for his parodies (He never releases a parody without permission). He has also been very successful in making the transition from traditional albums into music videos and then finally into YouTube and social media. Just looking at some of his more famous parodies gives some insight to his continuing relevance. From \"Weird Al\" Yankovic (1983) Ricky (Mickey, Toni Basil, 1982)Stop Draggin' my Car Around (Stop Draggin' My Heart Around, Tom Petty, 1981)From \"Weird Al\" Yankovic in 3D (1984) Eat It (Beat It, Michael Jackson, 1983)King of Suede (King of Pain, The Police, 1983)The Rye or the Kaiser (The Eye of the Tiger, Survivor, 1982)From Running with Scissors (1999) The Saga Begins (American Pie, Don McLean, 1971 {but the song is about The Phantom Menace, also released in 1999})Grapefruit Diet (Zoot Suit Riot, Cherry Poppin' Daddies, 1997)From Bad Hair Day (1996) Amish Paradise (Gangsta's Paradise, Coolio, 1996)From Straight Out of Lynwood (2006) White and Nerdy (Ridin, Chamillionaire, 2006)Canadian Idiot (American Idiot, Green Day, 2004) This is just a very short bit of his massive song list, but it is clear that his songs are very timely, either from the songs they are parodying or the event in the song, and despite many \"bootleg\" parodies and lesser known parody artists on YouTube and elsewhere, Weird Al is considered legitimate. As an interesting tidbit (not sure how true the story actually is) but Don McLean said in an interview that his kids loved The Saga Begins and played it very frequently in  his presence. He said it was so catchy that he found he actually started singing Weird Al's song in concert instead of his own. Thanks for the A2A ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, he's still \"weird\". The difference is, we've all grown a little weirder since Al originally debuted. When Al first played Another One Rides the Bus on the Dr. Demento Show, the audience was a somewhat small number of cranks. This was not mainstream, as the mainstream didn't really know what to do with it. Since then, the audience for the odd and unusual has grown dramatically, no small thanks to \"Weird\" Al himself. In addition, audiences have grown wary of manufactured pop, and want this kind of bland nonsense to be mocked. ",
