            "answer_text": "Because KPop is more westernised that JPop is. I mean,This is a normal JPop cute girl idol Group  If you see the photo,the style of the girls,this sort of colorful environment that is similar as candy and is kind of childish. This is not what US want. USA want things that are relatable to them,like this:   The Pussycat Dolls and Destiny Child show the taste of American people in music. And Korea knows this,and not just that but the government also is supporting the expansion of Korean culture, so they try to assimilate as much as American style so it feels more international. Like this:  You can clearly see American style fused with Korean culture. And that is why Korean try to expand outside Korea into the west(USA and EUROPE). But that doesn't mean Japan doesn't expand. Japan Idol culture is really known around Asia,and even many of your faves(if you have) know their songs,so Japan doesn't needs the USA as much as Korea does,but they still release English versions of their stuff. And about Idol Culture,JPop is an Asian favorite,more even than KPop:   SNH48,The Chinese (Ex)AKB48 sister group and Idol school(Made by Lin Lin,ex member of Jpop's Morning Musume),the first one loved by Chinese,show that many asian idols industries are Jpop wannabes.  And is not Just China,Indonesia has JKT48 and other counted have totally original groups like Thailand's Sweat16:  So ,In conclusion, Japan does what Asia want,and Korea does what USA may like\u2026sort of. But KPop isn't that big of a thing either in USA,but JPop is huge even in Russia,South Korea and India. ",

            "answer_text": "Better quality songs, better production, vocals, music videos. People around the world are not blind. Watch a live performance of BTS and whether you like it or not, their stage presence is insane and the performance puts many western artists to shame. For Jpop, it has been controlled by a few people since the 90s and there has been little change over the decades. The girl groups look creepy af acting and sounding like 12-year-olds, appealing to older men, the boy bands honestly cant sing or dance. They keep saying Japan has a big national market and dont want to appeal to the international market, but let\u2019s be real nobody outside Japan wants to feel like a pervert. Cpop, the language is a huge barrier. It just does not sound pleasant to the western ear and it looks like a knock off of kpop. Why would you want a knock off when the original is so much better? BTS released just a new single Dynamite and it went number 1 on itunes charts in over 100 countries instantly. Kpop and BTS is having their moment in history so just enjoy! ",
