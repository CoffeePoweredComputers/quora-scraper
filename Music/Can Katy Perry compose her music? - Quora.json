            "answer_text": "Katy Perry is a super talented songwriter. I wrote two songs with her just as her career was starting to blow up. She\u2019s very creative, and in my case she worked quickly. Katy used to be in the studio all the time when I was still in music publishing. We were all struggling writers, producers and artists. An opportunity came for us to write for an artist named Jessie James (now Jessie James Decker). The label said Jessie was looking for songs that had one foot in country and one in rhythmic pop. She was being billed as a sort of Christina Aguilera meets Shania Twain. So I put together this crazy beat with a banjo and acoustic, but to more of a dance beat - kind of \u201cDeliverance\u201d meets the pop world. As soon as Katy heard it she flipped and started singing this super fun, crazy lyric. The song is called \u201cBullet\u201d, and it\u2019s still one of my favorite things I have done. There\u2019s a released version with Jessie James, but if you want to check the demo we did with Katy, click below. So, yes she definitely can write her own music!  ",
