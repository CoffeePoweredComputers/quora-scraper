            "answer_text": "Here are some of my favorite songs which have a heavy bass line: 1. Goliath (Karnivool): Song begins with a sick ass odd time riff. Your head will be blown off when the bass starts.   2. Burning Sky (Porcupine Tree): After 3:31, the bass DOMINATES (of course, there's a brilliant guitar solo going along). Surely something you must have rarely experienced.    3. Sober (Tool): The bass line is the backbone of the entire song and you can hear it clearly right from the very beginning. Brilliant composition and unique, catchy drum groove. Not sure if this qualifies as heavy but definitely worth checking out.   4. A Wolf Amongst Ravens (After The Burial): The bass is heavy as fuck. Warning: This song might get stuck in your head. Proceed with caution. (And do check out most ATB, Meshuggah songs)   5. Dimman (Vildhjarta): Beautiful Djent.    ",

Spinal Tap\u2019s international hit, \u201cBig Bottom\u201d, is played on three basses simultaneously\u2014or four, if you count Derek Smalls\u2019s double-necked bass. With extra bass power from Viv Savage\u2019s keys and Mick Shrimpton\u2019s bass drums, this \u201cBig Bottom\u201d has the biggest bottom.  Although \u201cBattle Scar\u201d is considerably more rockin\u2019, and also has considerably more tasteful lyrics. . . ",
