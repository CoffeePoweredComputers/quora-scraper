            "answer_text": "It\u2019s more than one.. Uriah Heep was the most exiting band for me in the 70\u2019s I played in a band and we played many of their songs too. Highlight was in Oslo may 1974, live on Jordal amfi! One of my favorite songs ever is: July Morning.Deep Purple. The \u201cIn Rock\u201dalbum was one of the best heavy albums in the 70\u2019s. Ian Paice is my favorite drummer. His brilliant drum technique and musicality makes him truly play the drums. The rest of the band ain\u2019t bad either. Lots of good songs too.Led Zeppelin. Sounding quite different than the rest. \u201cHeavy Blues Kings\u201d. Driving Rock, soft ballads, and almost some very Country inspired songs. John Bonham(\u201cBonzo\u201d)The most heavy drummer in the 70\u2019s! Brilliant technique and his special timing. Awsome! Stairway To Heaven is to me one of the best rock songs ever!Status Quo! Brit Rock! I really woke up when I heard The \u201cPiledriver\u201d LP.\u201cDon\u2019t waste my time\u201d, \u201cOh Baby\u201d, \u201cPaper plane\u201d and \u201cBig Fat Mama\u201d was some of the songs we played. Very easy to learn, but much harder to do right and give it the right groove! Fun to play, listen and dance to!David Bowie and The Spiders From Mars. I loved Bowie! It was something that made him special and all the good songs. In the 70\u2019s he was the leading man in the \u201cRock Sky\u201d for me!",

            "answer_text": "Like many people born in the late 50\u2019s-early 60\u2019s, if you spent your formative teenage years in the 70s, chances are the answer is Led Zeppelin. I spent much of 1976 and 1977 playing air tennis racket in my living room. And some air bass and air drums. But no air vocals or lip syncing for me. I WAS Robert Plant\u2026you see, almost every day, Led Zeppelin's fleet of limos would get lost on the way to the gig and end up on my street, where I was waiting on the porch. I let them use my phone and of course they rewarded me with backstage passes. Then, would you believe it? Robert Plant's chronicly scratchy throat would flare up rendering him unable to perform. \u201cWhat to do? Hey, the guy that let us use his phone! He has long blonde wavy hair! He likes wearing flowery women's blouses! And he sings our songs better than Robert himself.\u201d (This is the conversation that Page, Jones and Bonham are having). I belt out their set perfectly and it's with sadness and respect for Mr. Plant that I decline their offer to become the new singer. But I will accompany them on tour, just in case\u2026 Plant resents my presence (presence, haha) and disses me in the song Carouselambra, released in 1979\u2026 That's how a bill becomes a law. Wait, what was the question??? ",
