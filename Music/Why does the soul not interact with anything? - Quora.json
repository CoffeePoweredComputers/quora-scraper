Your mind has needs\u2026 The mind has desires\u2026 The soul does not have those :) Why your hand moves! because you \u201cneed\u201d to do something. If there was no need and you do not know any need, will you hand move Atman! When you sleep deeply, your mind does not know any need\u2026. your hands do not move until there is some kind of discomfort and your sleep disturbed a bit and you change your posture. It is even foolish for the mind to talk even about the soul\u2026. it knows nothing of the soul\u2026.. if it knows someday\u2026.. all the needs and desires of the mind will be dropped too\u2026.

            "answer_text": "Why does the soul not interact with anything? Soul, Consciousness and I are one and the same in everybody and are constantly interacting with other Consciousness(es) or souls. I am the Consciousness, Soul, Jiva etc., and I am constantly interacting with others. I am the reality. To say I am different from the Soul is the result or effect of duality. It is also the imagination of the duality propagators. To say the soul is different from me, then it is mere imagination or idea, born from fragmentation. ",
