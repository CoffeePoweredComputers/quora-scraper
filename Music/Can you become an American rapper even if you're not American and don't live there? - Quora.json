And I realize that Europe isn\u2019t a country, I\u2019m just trying to make sure I don\u2019t offend any specific countries in Europe. Now, if your real question is \u201ccan you sell your music in America even if you\u2019re not an American and don\u2019t live there?\u201d, the answer is obviously yes, regardless of the genre of your music.
