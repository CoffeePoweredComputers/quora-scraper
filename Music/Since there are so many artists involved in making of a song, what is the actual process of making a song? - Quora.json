            "answer_text": "There are multiple methods to make a song.Lyrics, melody and chords are the building block of the song.Usually the songwriter develops the song till this stage, but it is possible for multiple artists to make a contribution in developing the lyrics, chord structure and melody of the song.For generic music writing, you may need to write the hook of the song, which is usually the chorus.Hook is a portion of the song which gets stuck in listener's head, it might be a interesting lyrical melody or a piece of music which gets repeated a couple of times in the song.Then you need to develop the song structure i.e Composing an intro for the song, Deciding and writing number of verses and finally a decent outro to end the song on a good note.Now it totally depends how you develop the structure, Assuming Verse to be \"A\" and Chorus to be \"B\".Structure could be anything like:A B A B orB A B A and the list goes on.Once a song is ready till this stage, it can be further developed vertically , that is where other musicians kick in. Drummer and the bass player will make one of the most important contribution, you may have multiple guitar players who may play the lead guitar and rhythm guitar respectively. You can have any of the artist throw a solo in the track after a verse or chorus as per the need, it may be a piano solo, guitar solo or even a saxophone solo.Musicians may keep building up the song as per their wish, once this entire process is done the song goes through the recording process and further moves into the post production stages.It is then distributed by a record label or through the internet which is the most popular method these days. I've tried to explain this in easiest possible manner, there is no single answer to your question because song development varies for different kind of artists and genres, but these are the stages which usually every song will go through.

            "answer_text": "Every song has its own process depending on the people involved in it. There are just a few basic steps that almost all artists(at least ALL major artists) follow. Beat selection; The performer has to purchase a beat from producer or as I prefer, they can make something of their own which suits their concept. Recording; this when all the vocals are recorded in a studio. Better studios charge higher rents, if the sound engineer is top notch then it's all worth it. Production; pretty much goes hand in hand while recording, again something which depends on the artist. Mixing; this is after the artist is done with all his work on the song and passes it on to the engineer to work on the quality of the song. Mastering; this is the last stage where the artist can suggest any changes that he wants to be done to the mix. This is when the final loudness and everything is finalised, after which the song is ready to be released. ",
