            "answer_text": "In short answer: Adobe After Effect and Premiere on Windows , Final Cut Pro on Mac, LyricVideoCreator on Windows and KineMaster on mobile phone. If youare an expert and have the demand to create something truly creative and innovative videos\u2026After Effects on Windows (or Final Cut Pro on mac) is your best bet as it focuses on making motion graphics with eye-catching effects. With it, you can create multiple layers to edit videos, audios, images, and text. As for moving backgrounds, brand logos, motion text, stickers, color suppression, or other things, you can easily make with Adobe Premiere with or without the variety of ready-made plugins or templates. You can make a little research on Google. Some templates are free to use.  Incidentally, though it takes some learning curve to master Adobe After Effects, there are a lot of video tutorials on YouTube that can help you to quickly walk through. Besides, the workflow on editing videos in AE is very similar like Photoshop and Premiere. Therefore, it may safe to say AE is also useful for beginners or anyone who learned one or two programs of Adobe family. If you are looking for some tools to quickly sync all lyrics to music, word by word or line by line\u2026Then you can use LyricVideoCreator and it enable you to tap to match lyrics and songs. I make lyrics video for In Your Eyes (from The Weeknd) in 35minitues with all text synchronize by using LyricVideoCreator. To correctly synchronizing all texts, I just need to listen to the music once and there are few marks that need to be adjusted manually.  Besides, it also allows me to add music, video, image background, and it supports to animate the text, backgrounds, and many objects. I also tried out SuperString after seeing the answers under this query. It is truly powerful. Everything things to be customizable and you can easily make stunning contents with it. Temporarily, it is a perfect product for me. It is reported to be buggy when importing a video background, so be careful when you selecting the background material. If you miss click + Video, all work you made previously may be destructed. You may need to build everything from scratch.  Online lyrics video editors, as like Flexclip, win on copyright free music stock and templates, but they are too basic in functions and are troublesome to sync lyrics which definitely not good to create any creative outcomes (at least the tools I tried thus far aren\u2019t good at editing lyric videos). If you want a good lyric video maker app on mobile phones,then I recommend you to use KineMaster. It supports dozens of music and video layers, and even allows you to keyframe effects. It did take a longer time to mark each line and enter all lyrics to get the finished work, but it is convenient for extracting files from your phone and fast applying your innovations everywhere.  ",

            "answer_text": "A lyric video is ain\u2019t just about the lyric alone. It\u2019s also about the song, its music, and the emotions it carries along with it.  Many beginners who create lyric videos nowadays are doing injustice to the original cover. They focus more on the right tools but forget the right way. They miserably fail to capture the essence and feel of the song. When you create a lyric video, you should also think about how you could make it visually interesting and transfer the beauty in the original cover into your lyric video. For a good lyric video, you would require the following elements along with the audio track and the lyric. 1.) Images & Videos - Find the right images and videos that can match the lyric in the song. 2.) Text with Animations - Text animations are the heart of the lyric video. 3.) Special animation effects - Animation effects help you bring the right feel to the song. 4.) Camera effects - Camera effects can make your lyric video look more lively. 5.) Creativity - It is the most important and underrated skill that can make your video look as good as the original cover! Now let's talk about the tool that can help you create lyric videos. Any normal video editor can do the job of adding text to a video. But as I said earlier a lyric video is not just about the text alone. In general, for all my video production purposes, I use an online application called animaker.com I use it for both 2D Animation and live video making. It also has stock photos and videos, text animation, camera effects etc. required to create a lyric video. I mainly use it for my youtube videos. I think it can be the right choice for lyric video making also. I hope this answer helps! :) ",

            "answer_text": "Just about any video creator that you can overlay text will work for this. I have my favorite much like everyone else, and in this case it\u2019s Klippyo. It\u2019s a new cutting-edge cloud-based video creator. I\u2019ve done this text overlay like you are looking to do in many video creators. Blender is free but it takes a bit of learning to use it. Klippyo I was able to pick up the first time and crank out a video in 5 minutes. It\u2019s like using a drag-and-drop editor. So just a little more info about Klippyo What are some of the types of things it can do? Edit videos entirely online. You can film videos with your phone and upload them in to work on them.Add video clips before and after (intros and outros) from ShutterStock.Import your existing videos from YouTube to work with.Overly text animationsOverlay meme headers and footers.Publish directly to YouTube from within the app.Add soundtracksMake different size videos including square and vertical for use in video marketing.Automatic captions or upload your own captionsSo it does some pretty cool things and from my own usage it\u2019s just really easy to use. And the price was far lower than I\u2019d expect for what you get. If you want to read a little more, the article over at Klippyo Review 2019 - REAL User Review and Complete Tutorial was really informative. ",
