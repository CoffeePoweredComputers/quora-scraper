            "answer_text": "That is because it is what Eddie Vedder is well-known for. The \u2018mumbling\u2019 that you heard in Yellow Ledbetter can also be found in other Pearl Jam tunes such as Black, Release and Last Kiss, where it is quite evident (although not too much like in Yellow Ledbetter for sure). This is also often known as yarling, and this singing style is very popular in the grunge and post-grunge/alternative metal genres. Popular vocalists such as Scott Stapp of Creed, Alex Band of The Calling and the late Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots are well-known to have used this singing style in their songs, but it was Eddie Vedder that brought it to mainstream consciousness, making it a staple of modern rock ever since. Here is a rather hilarious, tongue-in-cheek video I found in YouTube that sums up this singing style very well:  ",

The skeleton of the song can be heard in the enunciated words. It is about a family on their front porch and they have just been delivered a yellow letter ( which is sent to a family when the body isn't coming home from war). This was written during the Gulf War. It is titled Yellow Ledbetter in homage to a friend of Eddie's from Chicago. The guitar intro and outro is inspired by Hendrix song Little Wing. ",
