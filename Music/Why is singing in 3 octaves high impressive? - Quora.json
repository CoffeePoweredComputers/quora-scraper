            "answer_text": "Most trained singers can get around a 3 octave range. Whether it's impressive to have a 3 octave range I suppose is a matter of perspective. Knowing that the average vocal range is about 1.5 octaves, I guess one could be impressed. I personally think it's just one of many factors that contributes to a good singing voice. Having a wider than average vocal range is like being taller than most people. Being taller than most people doesn't mean you're going to be a better basketball player. Sure, it helps in some ways, but probably not the only thing you'd consider when you think of great basketball players. Another thing to consider when talking about vocal range is how well a person sings in every section of that range. Take myself for example. I'm a male baritone with access to parts of the tenor range giving me roughly a 3 octave range. However, because of the songs I like to sing I tend to sing on the higher end of my range so I naturally became more comfortable there. I personally struggle more singing on the lower end of my vocal range. Having a wide vocal range can seem impressive, but at the end of the day it's just a number. ",

            "answer_text": "I mean wheter it`s impressive or not is all based on personal perception. But most people in the music buisness thats singers tend to have a range of 3 octaves or more ofc not everyone but alot of singers do. But the important thing to remember is that having a 3 octave range in itself does not make you a great singer or even a compitent one. But it allows you more flexibility for singing if you have atleast 3 octaves then you should be able to sing basicly everything, without worrying about having to put songs an octave higher or lower. So getting a range of 3 octaves is a very good goal to have as a singer especially if you want to maybe make it a career. But it is not gonna determine how good of a singer you can be. But most of the singers people tend to think are some of the best singers of all time have all shared having a big range usally 3+ octaves ",
