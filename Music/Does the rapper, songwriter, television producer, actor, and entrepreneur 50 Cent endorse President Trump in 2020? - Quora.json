The media has people sucked in so bad that Joe Biden (who is the biggest racist going btw) is going to help everyone by taxing the shit out of everyone. And don\u2019t even try that BS about it being only for those over 400k. Maybe the 62% is, but removing the cuts you already got and the larger EIC is gonna crush the middle and lower middle class. Yea, love your media enough to give up your money? And, a lot of these elite can and will get paid off shore and keep money off shore. So, can you? Can you, from your apt in BK set up a Corp in another country and get paid through another dummy Corp to that one? Nope, why because you get a paycheck here in the US, you don\u2019t have that luxury. They do, so it\u2019s easy for them to tell YOU to vote away your paper. And, to really make sure you do, they are gonna lay it on racism, because nobody is smart enough to look past that angle. So, for every dollar you are gonna have under 38 cents! Literally, WTF ",
