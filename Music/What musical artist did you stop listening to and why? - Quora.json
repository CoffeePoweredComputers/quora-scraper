            "answer_text": "Led Zeppelin. I stopped listening to them many years ago (didn\u2019t buy any of their product after Presence). There are several reasons but I\u2019ll provide one: Robert Plant As he got older his voice was dodgy at best. And he knew it, but why didn\u2019t he just say that? Somehow, I couldn\u2019t see him relying on pitch control devices and other technical enhancements to improve his voice so it\u2019s obvious to see why he nixed the reunions. Also his arrogance, mostly because he had \u201cgrown tired\u201d of the constant question; \u201cWhen\u2019s the next Zeppelin reunion?\u201d What did he expect people to ask him? \u201cHow\u2019s the stamp collection coming?\u201d And when the questions did stop and more and more people began to lose interest, who was the first to start the rumours again? Him. I just got sick of the pompous asshole and his excuses. Page once told The NY Times he was ready to hit the stage with Zeppelin again \u2013 but blamed the lack of progress on a disinterested Plant. \u201cI was told last year that Robert Plant said he is doing nothing in 2014, and what do the other two guys think? Well, he knows what the other guys think. Everyone would love to play more concerts for the band. He\u2019s just playing games, and I\u2019m fed up with it, to be honest with you. I don\u2019t sing, so I can\u2019t do much about it. It just looks so unlikely, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Then on June 24, 2018 \u00b7 Robert Plant and Jimmy Page are in talks to reunite as Led Zeppelin for the band's upcoming 50th anniversary. Only to hear, \u201cPlant refuses to return to the stage with Page.\u201d Hundreds of times I\u2019ve heard the story that Led Zeppelin will reunite, only to hear hundreds of denials from Plant - all while getting the attention he still desperately craves. So he can engage in all the childish bubble-bursting he likes. I fail to see his relevance.  ",

            "answer_text": "First of let me claim one thing for my well being: Different music drives different people. So that out of the way, I stopped listening to any rapper in general. My first reason is because when I was a child, I had a past where I grew up on rap. I listened to it all of the time, but when I hit the right age, I finally started getting what the words meant. Usually talks about sex, porn, and irritable behavior that is atrocious. At this point, I started to read the Bible. It was my only escape from anything that involved sex, something I was convinced (under proverbs chapter 7) that involved women who were voluptuous and just basically ruined my childhood. Of course, this didn\u2019t go un-noticed. Eventually my hormones kicked in and I started to listen to Rap once again. This made me start digging the hole i\u2019m constantly trying to get out of. Secondly, the hole I\u2019m in became constant. I watched porn over and over, and before you know it, rappers started justifying the term \u201cfucking\u201d over good mutual sex. And then it started. Our schools began to corrupt. Want to know why rape culture is so prominent now? It\u2019s because\u2026 three: A lot of rap songs now talk about sex or \u201cfucking\u201d or hookers and hoes, prostitutes, etc. So to get me out of my hole, I prayed to god. I started listening to people like Eminem got morals rather than people like \u201clil pump\u201d or etc\u2026 So now I have found a happy-medium that limits the porn I watch, and I force myself to read the Bible so I don\u2019t lose the idea of a normal relationship and why girls are not prostitutes. I even started writing a book you may see later under my pen-name. That is, IF it comes out. So I encourage those who are in the same hole of addiction that I was to consider religion over pornography, and your life will be so much better. I promise you. Take my advice, or don\u2019t, it\u2019s up to you to change it. -Dan Strife ",
