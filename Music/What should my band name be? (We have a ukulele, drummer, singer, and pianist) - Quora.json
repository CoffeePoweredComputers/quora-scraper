            "answer_text": "First name that came to my mind was PUDS, the acronym for your instrument names. But that\u2019s a horrible choice unless you really want to stay small with a niche audience! I agree with Mike Walker that you\u2019re best to start from the audience\u2019s perspective. For my book No Brown M&Ms!, which features entrepreneurial lessons learned from rock legends, we researched the whole band name thing. Hands down, again and again, the most successful bands had/have names that are short, easy to spell, memorable, not too weird, and often relevant to their music/audience \u2014 a perfect example being Metallica. Relevance might be more literal, like the death metal band Cannibal Corpse, but it might also just be the feel of the name, like the \u201880s/\u201990s alt-rock band Trip Shakespeare. Fans of both bands relate to the names as evocative of what to expect from the music. Switch the names between those bands, and it\u2019s just wrong on every level. Of course, not all successful bands\u2019 names have relevancy to their fans or genre \u2014 not much about \u201cU2\u2033 speaks to its music or fans\u2019 taste \u2014 but if not, the name will usually have the other traits. You can\u2019t get any more short, easy to spell, memorable, and not weird than \u201cU2.\u201d I think there\u2019s an argument to be made that they wouldn\u2019t have been as successful if they\u2019d retained their original moniker: The Larry Mullen Band. Would you have been excited in 1980 to tell your friends about this incredible new band you just discovered called\u2026 The Larry Mullen Band? Word of mouth wouldn\u2019t have traveled so well, and there would\u2019ve probably been accompanying apologies: \u201cYou need to check out this great band from Ireland. Their name sucks, but they\u2019re really good.\u201d Essentially, it\u2019s all about branding. And just as businesses can learn from successful rock bands, rock bands can learn from successful businesses. Would Coca-Cola have become world famous and mega-successful if it\u2019d had a more common name of the times \u2014 like Dr. Winston\u2019s Magical Brain Elixir? Ultimately, if you have to go with one trait above the others, go with shorter (as long as it\u2019s not too weird). Our research found this to be the most distinguishing feature among successful bands. As you go from names with one word to two to three to four, the incidence of success goes markedly down. Five Finger Death Punch and Clap Your Hands Say Yeah are extremely notable exceptions, and probably partly because they\u2019re more appropriate for their time. It\u2019s safe to say those names would\u2019ve tanked in 1975. Typically, once you go to three words or more, people start abbreviating \u2014 e.g., ELO, ELP, and OMD. (In fact, the bands above are often referred to as just Death Punch or CYHSY.) Even two-word band names often get shortened by fans, such as Led Zeppelin being referred to as simply Zeppelin or Zep, and Iron Maiden being just Maiden. All this said, if your goal is to stay small, quirky, and indie, then (like Trip Shakespeare) you will probably not be harmed by choosing a name that violates the \u201crules\u201d I\u2019ve mentioned. If you were Duke and His Uke, playing in small clubs or touring regionally, the name isn\u2019t likely going to hinder your game. Your own marketing and promotion and tenacity (and music) will be far more of a factor. And thus you have all the oddball small-time names like Uncle Johnny\u2019s Rotten Kids, George Washington Lied, or The Painful Balls. They\u2019re great for niche success, but you\u2019ll be in a bind if larger potential success presents itself. An example that comes to mind is the 1980s alt-rock band Sex Maggot. They started to gain some traction and were stepping up into bigger success. But then a club owner in New England refused to put their name on his marquee, throwing a wrench into their tour plan. Realizing they\u2019d probably picked a bad name for the big picture, they became Goo Goo Dolls (from an old advertisement they saw for a \u201cGoo Goo Doll\u201d). I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stretch to say they would\u2019ve never gone on to massive 1990s popularity and sales if they\u2019d stuck to Sex Maggot. Finally, for trivia\u2019s sake and interesting reading, here\u2019s a great run-down of band name origins: List of band name etymologies - Wikipedia. (Although I\u2019ve been referring to rock band names because that\u2019s what I know best, my points still seem to apply to non-rock bands and acts, from what I\u2019ve seen in other genres.)
