            "answer_text": "1960s music was as incredibly varied as now, but the main difference was that this music was all part of a kind of monoculture. You see, you got to hear new music via radio and television, and everyone listened to and watched the same few stations. So in a weekly chart you would get singles bought by youth, their parents, and their parents. To give a famous example: in 1968 \u2018Lazy Sunday\u2019 by the rock band The Small Faces\u2014a tongue-in-cheek riposte to the older generation\u2014was kept from reaching the top of the charts by Louis Armstrong\u2019s \u2018What a Wonderful World\u2019 which was bought by the Small Faces fans\u2019 mums and dads. Another difference was that it was the golden era of singles\u2014two and three minutes of catchy hits\u2014rather than albums, which really came into their own in the later 1970s. And of course it was an era pre-synthesisers, electronic drum machines, and digital state of the art designer studios. Most singles weren\u2019t even in stereo. ",

            "answer_text": "The music of the early sixties was pretty melodic, softly wooing, gently encouraging. However, once The Beatles, The Rolling Stones (and so many more) arrived on the music scene, it was basic rock & roll explosion, and dancing took on a whole new level. Music became an event, a happening, instead of simply background. ",
