            "answer_text": "J-Hope actually nearly left twice. Once during predebut, the one they talked about in their Burn The Stage Documentary, and the other in early debut where BTS was receiving much hate. This one however was never confirmed but it was talked about. The one during predebut: Hoseok lost confidence and hope in himself and his future as an idol early on maybe since BigHit at that time was a small company nearing bankruptcy. He decided to leave and he actually did. The reason that he is with BTS now is because Namjoon/RM fought to bring Hoseok back. Namjoon really believed that BTS needs Hoseok for everything to work out so he talked to management to convince them that BTS needs Hoseok. I\u2019d imagine they conducted a meeting and Namjoon being the passionate person that he is, talked Hoseok into coming back. It\u2019s touchingly beautiful really. Namjoon fought because he BELIEVES in Hoseok and Hoseok came back because he BELIEVES in the members. The other one, is not really confirmed but I can roughly give an educated guess. It started on early 2014\u2026 J-Hope was singled out and was considered as the Bangtan Sonyeondan\u2019s weakest link. They hated hard on J-Hope saying mean things criticizing his position and looks. It snowballed too much that eventually, the #KickOutJHOPEbts trended in twitter. Since BTS is active on twitter, it is believed that the boys saw this. On the surface, nothing really came out of this except maybe for a counter hashtag #JHopeYourePerfect trending worldwide. J-Hope did not leave, BigHit did not address the issue and BTS continues their activities. I want you to keep in mind the timeframe here. Remember, this is in 2014. On the summer of 2014 BTS filmed a reality show called American Hustle Life. You can get a glimpse in that reality show that they are working with their Dark and Wild Album there. The title track was Danger\u2026 It was revealed that this era was their lowest point (As said by suga in his happiness graph in 2019 season greetings. He was really detailed per era though XD). 2014 really was a rough time for BTS. There were rumors about J-Hope wanting to quit that time but obviously he didn\u2019t so nothing came of it. For the next years, J-Hope always mentions about gaining the fan\u2019s affections. Which proves that he is indeed aware of all the hate that he gets. \"I will do my best to gain the love and respect of the fans\" circa 2014\u20132015 \"I want to be loved and respected by ARMY in 2017\" circa 2016 on his goal for 2017 and more. But the thing that made me sure that J-Hope indeed tried quitting is an offhand statement from Tony in an interview years later. (BTS worked closely with Tony on American Hustle Life) Now Tony obviously did not mention any names but he did say that at the time they were filming AHL a member was in talks of wanting to leave BTS\u2026 You get where I\u2019m coming at? The time frame, the hardships and stress they faced in 2014, the rumors, Hobi\u2019s statements for the next years, A glimpse of how BTS really struggled in Danger era before (by Suga), and lastly, Tony\u2019s inside scoop. Putting all of these together gave me that, but of course, J-Hope never gave up and that\u2019s all that matters. All of these made him the person he is now and I\u2019m happy that even though he is in a better place now, he is still the J-Hope that we know and love. Don\u2019t hate me too much for my guess, I mean you asked for my input so I just answered with my honest thought. ",

            "answer_text": "Before BTS was even recognized by the world, Big Hit started the company in a garage/small room (check Bang PD\u2019s tweets if you must). Then you know the history. They wanted to create a hiphop group, brought in kids that actually knew how to rap. Including RM and Suga, as far as I remember, they were in the first line up for the hiphop Bangtan. And then when Jhope was brought it, if you see accounts of him saying, he could dance but he had no background about rapping, so he must have been given the post to be one of the vocalists instead after the other rappers of the original BTS left. But being with 2 rappers, he must have gotten great inspiration from them so he ended up wanting to rap aside from dancing. Considering how he managed to hone himself as the main dancer and one of the rap line in BTS, he must have spent a considerably great amount of time practicing those 2 things, especially rapping. So, imagine being Hoseok in the beginning. He worked hard to be in BTS, waiting for the day that BTS will debut, but then there\u2019s just so much uncertainty surrounding it after (1) the 1st BTS line up did not pull through, (2) they want to perform so bad, get to put their group\u2019s name out there, be loved by fans, and earn great achievements but then your company is barely known (add the not so good reputation \u2014 from what I read) and you\u2019re just broke kids trying to survive in the harsh reality of kpop, I bet Hoseok must have had his own doubts abt himself, the group itself and his future. If you may remember, Hoseok himself said, he wasn\u2019t that bright before (Jhope made Hoseok who he is and that\u2019s really great) and maybe he was just like any other kid who also has his fears. Fear of the unknown. And that could have been the reason why he wanted to quit. Bc their future was unknown. It was a good thing that he decided to come back and that their bond even from those hard times was so strong it gave Jhope the push he needed to pursue the path he definitely wanted. ",
