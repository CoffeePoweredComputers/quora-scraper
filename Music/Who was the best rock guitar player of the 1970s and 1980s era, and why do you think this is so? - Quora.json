Uli Jon Roth - c\u2019mon, you know his playing from UFO Leo Kottke - Acoustic guitar genius John McLaughlin - Gibson 6/12 into a Marshall full stack\u2026Fusion pioneer Ritchie Blackmore - His work with Rainbow alone qualifies him Jimmy Page - Yes, must include because the music he wrote was very good (though as a player he is a little sloppy at times) Brian Setzer - Actually a far better player than people realise Amos Garrett - sublime brilliance Peter Frampton - In spite of being a pop star, he is actually a very good player Steve Marriott - unsung and often overlooked. Too bad for you. Peter Haycock - original Climax Blues Band guitar player, really great Shawn Lane - died too soon, but just brilliant Malcom Young - one of the best rhythm players ever Mattias Jabs - In spite of everything, a great player Steve Clark - another died too soon, but great player Michael Schenker - great player underappreciated Eddie Van Halen - yes, yes\u2026blah blah blah\u2026 And there are others, of course. But this gives you a good start. ",

            "answer_text": "First off, any questions about best guitar players, must differentiate between rhythm guitar players and lead guitar players. It is totally pointless to talk about this subject without splitting them up. I am going to assume you meant lead guitar players. For me, a great lead guitar player must be able to take me on a long journey, ideally, to another place in space and time. Usually requires a long solo of over 5 minutes. For the 70s and 80s, assuming this means Jimi Hendrix is disqualified and people who did not have a strong presence in the 70s are also disqualified (like SRV, Prince,Trey Anastasio, etc.), and people who did not do anything useful in the 80s also out (EC, Johnny Winter, Mick Taylor, etc.) here are my favourites, in no particular order: Jeff Beck Frank Zappa Jerry Garcia John MacLaughlin Jimmy Page Eddie Hazel David Gilmour Santana Robert Fripp ",
