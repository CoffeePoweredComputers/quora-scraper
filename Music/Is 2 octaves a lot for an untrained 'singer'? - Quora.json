            "answer_text": "Two octaves is a good start. Lots of male singers in different rock groups get by on one or one and a half. Most opera singers work with 3, I can get really close to 3, I blame my smoking (don't smoke). My father has one and is tone deaf haha, but my grandpa was a tenor and sang opera in his 30s and 40s. Axl Rose from guns & roses holds the record with 5 (just under 6) Range isn't necessarily what makes a good singer. There's lots of inflection and nuance too. To me the most important thing for a singer is to have a distinct voice. There's a lot you can practice and perfect in a 2 octave range and being young your voice still has a lot of developing to do. My choir instructors loved me in high school because I had some serious pipes, towards the end of high school my voice started changing and I was scared what was happening to it, now I have a very deep voice yet I wouldn't trade the falsetto I can sing now for anything.

            "answer_text": "Well most people have about 2 octaves worth of singing range for all genders. Where the range falls depends upon the gender and other factors (higher or lower pitched voice). With training yes you can boost your range especially if you sing Soprano/Tenor (female/male respectively these parts have the higher vocal range when singing). These exercises do help and can boost your range a bit. Nothing extreme though. No soprano can train to sing in the base range and vise versa. But no amount of training will get a female to sing a LOW note (even if you are an alto) or a male to sing in the upper end of the soprano voice (especially true for bases who often give up after middle C or higher. For reference some sopranos can sing HIGH C but most are like about high Aish give or take so REALLY HIGH PITCHED NOTE). Really your range depends on so many factors and I can\u2019t exactly tell where it falls. But you will know your comfortable range if you don\u2019t already know it. You should also worry about other things like dynamics, vowels, consents, and so much more. This is more important than your range. Best to sing beautifully, in whatever your singing range is! ",
