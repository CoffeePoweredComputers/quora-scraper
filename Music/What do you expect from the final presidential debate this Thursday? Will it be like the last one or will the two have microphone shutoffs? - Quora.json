            "answer_text": "Trump will lose. The simple fact is that Trump does not do debates. He does the Trump show with guest stars. America apparently found it entertaining enough to order four years of episodes in 2016, but ratings are down now, we've mostly realized that having a prevaricating idiot for a leader is not effective or a good look, and Biden, for all his flaws, is an actual leader who knows how to do things like debate. So one of two things will happen: (1) Trump, having taken the advice of his far smarter campaign team, will recognize that the \u201cderanged badger\" non stop attack routine didn't help him or rattle Biden, and so he needs to make up serious ground and try to act more \u201cPresidential\". He cannot do this. He cannot quote convincing facts and figures, talk about policy (beyond saying in vague terms that \u201cwe are gonna do\" this or that with no specifics whatsoever) or do anything but try to be a little more circumspect in dressing up his attacks on Biden. If he does this successfully, he will be seen as low energy and unconvincing. (2) Either by design or simply out of frustration, he'll revert to his reflexive pattern of beligerrent nastiness and go back on the nonstop attack raving about the fresh \u201callegations\" about Hunter Biden, how Joe Biden is a communist and so on. Biden will expect it and do more of the \u201cI'm not talking to you, I'm talking to the American voter\" bit, and Trump will once again look small and petty. The only possible way I could see Trump pulling a \u201cwin\" out of this is if Biden does rattle, and badly. But given the way the last debate played out, Biden will be expecting that, and once again perceive that the entire task for him is to appear as a composed, intelligent human being in contrast to a snide jerk who has nothing up his sleeve but hurled insults and sleazy insinuations. So that seems unlikely to avail Trump either. The fact is, Trump is caught in a web of his own making. He made several strategic errors in this campaign- painting Biden as senile when Biden has been able to easily show he's reasonably mentally sound; doing several baffling policy turnarounds, allowing Democrats to show voters they're the only ones with real plans; and continuously downplaying his biggest liability, the coronavirus, even when he might have used his own infection to pivot to concern- to name but a few. Of course, Trump's one and only real move is and has always been \u201cI'll wing it. I'm awesome, so it'll work\". That has essentially boxed him in. Given the binary nature of American politics, it might actually turn out to be enough now that he's in power, but it's looking less and less likely. Certainly whatever happens, he's not going to improve his chances by debating at this point. It's just not who he is. ",

It\u2019s Trump\u2019s last chance to get his smear tactics against Biden out to a large audience, instead of just playing it to his base. I can\u2019t imagine he would pass up the opportunity. No idea whether they will cut off his mic - frankly, I can\u2019t quite imagine that. If they did, he would probably walk out - which would be really awesome! ",
