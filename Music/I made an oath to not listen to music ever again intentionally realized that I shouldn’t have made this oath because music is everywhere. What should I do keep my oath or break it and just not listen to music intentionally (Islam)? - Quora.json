            "answer_text": "Listen, you are a human being. You can make mistakes while giving oaths to your God. Of course, it hurts. You had your reasons for never listening to music, but as you said, music is everywhere. In your religion modern American music is prohibited because it has bad lyrics about sex. Yet there is Russian pop music with deep philosophical lyrics about life and there is Chinese pop music where the subject of suffering and the limitations of being human is brought up. How is avoiding this kind of music good? Sometimes vows are meant to be broken if they make no sense. ",

            "answer_text": "No religion is worth giving up music for. Truly. Music gives joy and pleasure and wonder and solace and worship and contemplation of the divine to billions of people. What in the world are you trying to do to yourself? Truly? This makes me very, very sad for you. If there\u2019s a heaven, it has music in it. If you want to split hairs, \u201clistening\u201d is intentional while \u201chearing\u201d is unintentional. But while you can stop listening to God, you can\u2019t stop hearing God. Same with music. Let yourself off the hook, do. Stop taking yourself so very seriously. ",
