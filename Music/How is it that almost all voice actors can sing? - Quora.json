            "answer_text": "Well you didn't clarify If you are talking about japanese voice actors or American/British /others ones. So I will answer this for all Japanese voice actors (seiyuu):  Before 2000s , voice actors were very limited to world for anime industry and at that time anyone with good vocal skills were choosen ( if you observe , some of the old Animes will have glitches or overturning somewhere) The songs were mostly sung by popular idols or bands , but companies requested for more realistic experience. So they introduced character songs (which was experimental only) The characters song were very hard to acquire outside Japan first but nowadays it's available everywhere. And I assure you they weren't that good at that time. If you would take the age gap of 30\u201350 you would find many few good singer seiyuus. Now coming to modern days, Many voice acting institutions and academies prefer voice actors who are talented in dancing and singing too. They train those voice actors for random seiyuu events. ( If you would like you can check on YouTube) That's how they can sing. American/British/ other voice actors:  The animated movies sell good if a famous actor/actress is working in it. So they choose those actors who can sing better. ( Like Scarlett Johansson in sing/ Jenifer Lopez in ice age series) While other characters are mostly professional voice actors who had acted in many other programmes. So this almost concludes their signing talent. For more please comment below. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it depends on what you consider to be \u201cgood\u201d singing, or what you mean by \u201ccan sing\u201d\u2026 but let\u2019s assume your premise is true and that you mean they can sing well. Think of the way a jazz musician wields their trumpet or saxophone (or\u2026). It\u2019s like they\u2019re having a conversation with you, using that instrument. They know the instrument\u2019s capabilities and limitations, as well as their own capabilities and limitations. First off, you\u2019ll only be a voice actor if you like using your voice. So there\u2019s a baseline there of how you use it, how often you use it, the way you use it, the way you think about using it, etc. Like a jazz musician or an athlete constantly working to get better. Now if we accept that one\u2019s voice is an instrument, as many (voice) actors and singers consider it to be, then using that instrument more often, and in more ways\u2014expressive, creative ways that \u201cexercise\u201d it like a muscle\u2014will help you to be sharper with it. So if the more one exercises a muscle or plays an instrument, the more effectively they can use said muscle/instrument, then a voice actor who pays attention to their speaking voice and works to wield it \u201cbetter\u201d will have a better understanding of their singing voice as well, and thus will be able to maximize their singing ability. They might not actually be a great singer, but they know how to use what they have (and they are likely tuned into how other people use that instrument, unconsciously taking notes at all times). So: the average voice actor is more tuned into their voice, uses it more frequently and critically than a non-voice actor, enjoys using it however they can, and thus raises the bar on their entire range of uses of the \u201cinstrument\u201d that is their voice. One last note\u2026 I don\u2019t really have science to back this up, but I believe that there\u2019s sort of a virtuous cycle in which speaking aids your singing aids your speaking\u2026 and so on. Anecdotally speaking, when I sang a cappella in high school, I noticed my speaking voice became richer and deeper as my singing abilities improved. ",
