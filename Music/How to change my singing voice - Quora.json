            "answer_text": "While I disagree with the attribution of classical terms (baritone, bass etc.) to non-classical voices, I'll list a few points for you to consider: Not liking your voice is similar to not liking your looks; it is usually a sign of something else and therefore changing it will not change your feeling.You can't change your vocal category. It's like changing your height or skin color - it's an integral part of you and changing it cannot be done without permanent damage. You must learn to live with it and love it. That being said, beginning singers often do find their voices change, sometimes drastically. When I was 18 my base-voice was a bass-baritone and nowadays it is a tenor. But it just means the voice settles on its natural category with proper training, not changing the true nature of the voice. So it might change somewhat, but not because you hate it - on the contrary, it will only change if you love it enough to nurture it.I strongly disagree with \"I can't sing love songs to girls\". If someone doesn't like your voice, they're not worthy of you. In any case, people usually love deeper voices while being critical of higher ones.I don't know why you can't sing the specific songs you mention. I doubt it's your vocal category. Are you referring to their key? If a song is too high for you, it doesn't necessarily mean you can't sing it - just transpose it! It's standard practice in the classical world for many types of songs, such as German Lieder. Some songs you can't sing even after transposition, but not always. You don't have to sing a song in its original key.Vocal color, in my opinion, is not an integral part of the association between a voice and a song. If you want to sing a voice that's associated with a brighter color, just sing it naturally. Nobody says it shouldn't be sung by a darker voice.If you \"lighten\" your voice on purpose it will diminish it in every way possible. You will not be able to employ your full range, you will not be able to sound even throughout your registers, you will not be able to develop. Don't purposefully darken or lighten until you're an advanced singer who wants to change a specific note for some effect.Many singers don't realize this and many forget it even after they do, but you don't sound the way you hear yourself, and recordings unless done in a studio are not representative of your sound. You may sound darker/murkier to yourself than you do to others - that's why you need a teacher.It bears repeating once more: you can't purposefully alter your voice and you can't progress until you love it. If you hate your voice, it's representative of something else. Seek an answer to that instead.",

            "answer_text": "I am an amateur and am only a vocal student, so my answer might not be the most helpful, but were you using the right technique (i.e. applying your diaphragm for notes support) or placement for your voice (one that is not too low)? Most people, including myself, have a narrow vocal range when they first start as singers, and with training they will eventually expand it further.  I have a feeling that you have been either having too much unnecessary tension when you are singing higher or placing your voice too low when singing. In order to lighten the voice, you cannot place the voice too low or too far back in your throat when singing higher or you are going to end up either sounding too dark / deep (being deep-voiced is fine, but you would not want the tone to be too dark) or straining and damaging your voice trying to hit those higher notes. I might be wrong in this, but most people that I know who cannot sing high were actually not using the voice correctly instead of having 'naturally low voices' that prevents them to sing higher (and most baritones I have met can sing quite high when they want to). At the same time, are you using the throat when you are singing? It will only be a very short time before you hit a barrier and cannot go higher if you do not use the proper breath support for singing.  You might want to consult a qualified vocal coach for a much better explanation and solution to your problem. At the same time, do not force your notes all the way up when you are singing; stick to what is comfortable for you first until you learn to build your technique and range further. Even professional singers who have wide ranges tend to change the key of the songs of other artists they cover as they know the strengths and limitations of their voices better.  I wish you all the best! :) ",

            "answer_text": "Sounds like you're really suffering. I'm not sure I can help, but here goes.  If you're talking about changing your vocal range so you can sing in the higher keys, I'm afraid it's not going to be possible. With a lot of training you could just possibly extend your voice a semitone upwards, but going by what you're saying you'll need to extend your range by an octave. Basically, you can't turn into a tenor, overnight or otherwise.  What you might be able to do is to sing without so much weight. Don't press when you vocalize, don't dwell on the physical sensations of singing low, low, low. Think high, think light, raise your soft palate, smile, raise your cheekbones when you sing, think of the sound coming out from your eyes rather than the bottom of your stomach.  A tangential approach to managing your problem is to try singing the songs you want to, but in your own register, and - this is important - don't attempt to sound like the original artiste. Don't fall into the misconception that the original is always best; you'd be surprised how many hits sound completely different, and even better, when reimagined for a different voice part. If a song is well written, it usually sounds good in any range. ",
