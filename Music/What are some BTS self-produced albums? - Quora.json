Caution:- Long answer ahead!!!!!! BTS members mixtapes: So far, only the rap line members of BTS have released mixtapes \u2014 although it is expected that we\u2019ll see a mixtape from Jungkook sometime in the future RM  Release Date: March 17, 2015 RM tracklist:1.

Life10. \ud45c\ub958 (Adrift)11. I Believe (Ft. BTS) In an interview, RM discussed his mixtapeand talked about the meaning behind \u201cDo You.\u201d RM said, \u201c\u2018You Do You, I Do I\u2019 is the catchphrase for this mixtape. What I want to say is that, \u2018You do what you have to do, and I\u2019ll do what I have to. But I\u2019m like this. The thought of, \u2018You\u2019re you, and I\u2019m me\u2019 is the largest thing that\u2019s been taking control of me lately.\u201d RM described \u201c\ub18d\ub2f4 (Joke)\u201d as being a song meant to show off his skills, \u201c\u2018Joke\u2019 is a song whose lyrics were written with a stream of consciousness. That\u2019s why the title is called \u2018Joke\u2019 as well. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing hidden behind the lyrics. It\u2019s 500% for the auditory pleasure of rap songs. Since the other songs have messages or emotions placed into them, I felt that it was necessary to add in a refreshing song without any thoughts. I put in a lot of what I believe are rap \u2018skills\u2019.\u201d Agust D  Release Date: August 16, 2016 Agust D tracklist:1. Intro; Dt sugA (Ft. DJ Friz)2. Agust D3. Give It To Me4.

So Far Away (Ft. SURAN) \u201cAgust D\u201d kicks off the mixtape with strong lyrics, which was Suga\u2019s goal. He stated in an interview that the mixtape \u201chas everything I wanted to do with hip-hop as the foundation. There are strong lyrics that will make people say, \u2018Huh? He did this?\u2019 and \u2018Is it okay for him to write such lyrics?\u2019 Anyway, I feel relieved since I was able to tell my stories.\u201d \u201cGive It To Me\u201d is another track on the album that shoots down the haters the rappers of BTS had to deal with early on in their career, briefly touching on the doubts even his own family had before moving on to discuss the cut throat entertainment industry. Speaking about the mixtape, Suga also stated, \u201cI wanted to reveal my honest thoughts about youth. I wanted to express myself transparently with the purpose of doing everything I wanted to do.\u201d Fun fact: Suga did a Maschine mk2 review on BangtanTV and wrote a beat in the process, which he later incorporated into the song \u201cThe Last\u201d on Agust D.

Airplane7. Blue Side (Outro) On a V Live to discuss the mixtape, J-Hope revealed the meaning behind \u201cDaydream (\ubc31\uc77c\ubabd)\u201d and his other songs. He said, \u201c\u2018Daydream\u2019 is a dream that you have in the day. And dreams are mostly impossible to achieve. But this song talks about how I want to dream about the impossible.\u201d \u201cJ-Hope is a person that is known to the public, and a public figure. And with that title, there comes responsibilities and burdens. I understand those aspects of this position, but it\u2019s only natural that Jung Hoseok as a person has his own needs as a human being. This song is about those desires.\u201d J-Hope also revealed that he wrote the track for \u201cAirplane\u201d while they were on tour in Chicago, then later wrote the lyrics while they were flying. \u201cWhen I was a little boy, my wish was to be on an airplane. My wish was to get on a plane and fly in the sky. Here it is. \u2018Now I fly all I want, on the airplane.\u2019 It reminded me of old memories,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to dream of it. And now\u2026I remember I was sitting in a very nice seat on the plane. I was listening to the instrumental version of this song, looking at the night sky. The lyrics just popped into my head. I thought, \u2018This is what being inspired feels like.'\u201d Mono.  Release Date: October 23, 2018 Mono. tracklist:1. Tokyo2. Seoul3. Moonchild4.

Forever Rain In a V Live about Mono., RM revealed that he always wanted to write a song about the rain and that was what inspired \u201cForever Rain.\u201d RM stated, \u201cWhen I thought about the word \u2018Forever Rain\u2019 I heard the sound of piano in my ears. I was into producing back then. I wanted to produce the entire song, including the beat and everything.\u201d \u201cI used the word \u2018forever\u2019 because I wonder if I can make a song that touches my heart again. After I die, I would like this song to be played at my funeral. There\u2019s no more song that\u2019s so like me than this. I have a strong emotional attachment.\u201d RM also revealed that he wrote \u201cMoon Child\u201d before he wrote \u201c4 o\u2019clock.\u201d \u201cPeople who prefer the night. At night\u2026 Well, it probably reminds you of \u20184 o\u2019clock.\u2019 During the day, feeling choked, whether it\u2019s because of the job or something. Then at night, getting away from other\u2019s eyes, and getting away from the shackles,\u201d RM explained, discussing the inspiration behind the track. \u201cPeople who feel a sense of freedom. I think there will be lots of people like that. Especially people these days. People like me. These days, I don\u2019t like the night that much. I also like the day, but the night\u2026I made this song, when I thought the night liberated me.\u201d Songs produced by BTS members for other artists: Along with producing their own tracks for their mixtapes and BTS albums, both Suga (Min Yoongi) and RM (Kim Namjoon) have produced tracks for other artists.
