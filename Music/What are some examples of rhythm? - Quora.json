            "answer_text": "Whenever and wherever two sounds occur successively in time, that\u2019s rhythm. There are different types of rhythm: isochronus, nonisochronous, additive, diatonic, etc. The easiest rhythm to hear is a regular (isochronous) pulse; this is what is calculated as beats per minute. This pulse is called the tactus. It can be proportionally augmented or diminished\u2014thatis\u2014it can be divided into 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, etc., as well as doubled, tripled, quadrupled, etc. Additive rhythm works with beat groupings rather than a steady pulse: 2+3, 3+3+2, 4+4+3, etc. With these types of rhythms, the total number of beats per cycle is simply derived by adding up all the separate groupings. I once learned a tabla kaida from the late, great Ustad Allah Rakha Khan in Teentaal (176-beat cycle) with the following grouping: 11+7+5+9. Another rhythmic technique is syncopation (offbeats). However, in order to perceive syncopation, you need a regular pulse against which the offbeat pulses are sounded. Yet another rhythmic technique is swing, by which a pulse\u2019s even subdivisions are \u201cswung,\u201d rendering them uneven. Jazz swing is often understood as the eighth note being substitutde for a triplet in which the 1st and 3rd pulses are sounded. This puts more distance between the first and second subdivided pulses, creating an uneven but really groovy pendular swing effect. ",
