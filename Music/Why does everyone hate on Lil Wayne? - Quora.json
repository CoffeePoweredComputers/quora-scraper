            "answer_text": "Because of bars like: \u201cI roll up on a dictionary. That's high definition.\u201d And \u201cReal G\u2019s move in silence like lasagna.\u201d Or maybe \u201cI'm all about my riches. My name should be Richard.\u201d Or how about \u201cI tried to fuck the world, but couldn't even get aroused.\u201d Wow. I don't waste time \u2018hating\u2019 on rappers. But if it's asked why people \u2018hate\u2019 on rappers, I have to oblige to point out bars like those. I think for a lot of people, it's not that the rappers themselves actually bother them, it's the fact that certain rappers get notoriety when there are so many other artists who are more worthy of the opportunity to be given such a platform. If I was to be completely honest, on the grand scheme of modern-day rappers in mainstream music, Lil Wayne isn't that bad. But that says less about how good Lil Wayne is and more about how shit so many of these new up and comers are. ",

            "answer_text": "Lil Wayne was a guilty pleasure in the late 90's early 00's. It was stupid music and he had a funny voice. Then The Carter came out and it was actually kind of dope. But that got played out and Carter 2 sucked and Carter 3 sucked and the albums got worse and worse, I think he even tried making a rock album at one point, and he just became a parody of himself and people got sick of him. Not all that different from many pop stars, and thats what Wayne was or is\u2026\u2026 ",
