I was thinking maybe he had some activist raps or something but it does not appear that way. I am for sure not the judge of what punk is and isn\u2019t but in my definition i do not see anything about him that fits my definition of punk. Which is equally fine, i don\u2019t think punk is exactly what he was going for lol. Playboi Carti - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not an expert in this area and don\u2019t really know his music much but my understanding is his musical style is not considered punk at all. More Playboi Carti himself is considered a punk-like icon in his interest in eschewing social and political norms in favor of his own roots and ideals. That is not unusual in hip-hop and I think many people feel hip-hop carries the torch that punk did in the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s. ",
