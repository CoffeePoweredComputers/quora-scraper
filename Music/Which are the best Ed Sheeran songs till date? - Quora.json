            "answer_text": "Galway GirlI love this song, legit love it, it\u2019s not like normal pop songs with the same track, with the same chords but instead, has this Irish tint to it and the instrumentals are awesome. If you listen carefully, you can hear the lovely violin playing at the beginning of the song and also\u2014 the video of this song was pretty great, it had amazing cinematography with Saoirse Ronan, of course :) 2. Nancy MulliganThis is one of the most underrated songs of Ed Sheeran. It again has an Irish tint to it and is not like cliche pop songs. What I love about this song, are the lyrics, they\u2019re truly amazing and they actually depict the love story of Ed\u2019s grandparents, William Sheeran and Nancy Mulligan. Both of them lived in Ireland and one of them was Catholic, while the other was protestant, like every love story, they were forced apart but they ran away together\u2026 Cliche, but I love it :)  3. Thinking out LoudHeh, another Ed love song. :)Not only does this song consist of freaking amazing vocals but lyrics of every love story single people would desire\u2026 See for yourself\u2026 So honey nowTake me into your loving armsKiss me under the light of a thousand starsPlace your head on my beating heartI'm thinking out loudMaybe we found love right where we are  4. PerfectWow, I thought we had enough love songs on the list, guess we\u2019re adding more\u2026This song is just the definition of good music, it makes you feel things, the lyrics hit you and the vocals amaze you. Here are some lyrics: Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my armsBarefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite songWhen you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breathBut you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight  5. Castle on the hillDo I have to explain why I find this song amazing?Not one person whom I know has heard this and not liked it.If you don\u2019t like it, you probably have bad taste in music :)  ",

            "answer_text": "Ed Sheeran, he has a song for every mood of yours. His song-writing ability is exemplary to other artists. I love all of his songs and I\u2019m eagerly waiting for his next album \u2018Divide\u2019. Here are my top 10 favourite songs of Ed. Wake Me Up.When I first heard this song I absolutely fell in love with it. I thought I\u2019d dedicate this song to my girlfriend. Except for the facts that I didn\u2019t have a girlfriend, neither did I know how to play guitar, nor did I have any singing skills. My singing would even make Gyan (from Doraemon) feel like a popstar. 2. Lego House.I first heard this song in 2012 when Ed performed it on Grammy Awards night and I instantly knew that this boy is going to be a huge popstar. I immediately started searching for some of his other songs and before I realised I had became a Sheerio.  3. Thinking Out Loud.When this song came out it became a speedy success and quickly established Ed as a most loved song writer. His lyrics and voice are fantastic in this song. Even his dancing skills are admirable.  4. All of the Stars.When I first watched The Fault in Our Stars I absolutely loved that movie. (The book was really good too.) The fact was, somehow, I was not aware that Ed had written a song for this movie and then the credits started rolling and I heard Ed\u2019s voice and then for the next month this song was constantly on the top of my playlist.  5. Gold Rush.One fine evening I was lying on my bed and I plugged my headphones into my phone and started playing Ed\u2019s album \u2018+\u2019 on shuffle. I came across this song and it quickly became one of my all time favourite.  6. UNI.You just need to listen to this song and after that all you\u2019ll need to do is rewind it and listen again\u2026 and then again\u2026 and then again\u2026  7. Tenerife Sea.There were various rumours about this songs - that this song was written for some girl named Beth; another rumour was that it was written for Taylor Swift. But no matter what the story behind this song it remains one of the best songs of Ed Sheeran.  8. Take It Back.Ed was absolutely flawless in this song. His lyrics, his flow, his rhythm, his everything was absolutely on point. The upbeat music makes this song even more lovable.  9. Give Me Love.This was the second song of Ed\u2019s that made its way into my playlist (the first being Lego House) and it is still one of my favourite. Ed just killed it in chorus.  10. Even My Dad Does Sometimes.This till date remains one of his best written song. His lyrics just give the proper meaning to the phrase: Keep Calm and Carry On.   Edit 1:When I wrote this answer Ed\u2019s \u2018Divide\u2019 wasn\u2019t released at that point. After that album came out some of the songs attached themselves to me to such extent that I ended up loving them even more than some of Ed\u2019s previous songs. I understand that this a Top 10 list and adding a few more songs might deter the integrity of the question but I would still like to do it\u2026 Perfect. Oh, man! This song is just the epitome of best-written love songs ever. Whenever I listen to this song I just can\u2019t help but think of my girlfriend.(Actually, I don\u2019t have a girlfriend I just visualise myself with some girl! :D )Yeah! Ed\u2019s songs causes me hallucinations\u2026 :D Happier. Oh man! I just love the simplicity and the lucidity of this song. They way Ed has written it, you just can\u2019t keep yourself away from humming the chorus of this song. Dive. So don't call me babyUnless you mean it.Don't tell me you need meIf you don't believe it.So let me know the truthBefore I dive right into you. Nancy Mulligan. This song just cheers me up every time I hear it. The beats, the words, the meaning. Ed said that this song is about his grandparents\u2019 love story about how they met and fell in love and got married. I just love this song. ",
