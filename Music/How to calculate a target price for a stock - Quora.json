            "answer_text": "I set both buy and sell targets for my long-term options using my contrary Automatic Investment Management (AIM) investing method. If I own 10 contracts I pick a lower price where my AIM investing method tells me to buy 3 more and a find a higher sell price where AIM would tell me logically to buy 3 more. For example if I buy 10 long-term option (LEAPS) at $300 per contract I find if the contract goes down to $225 a contract I will buy 3 more. When the contract goes up to $425 a contract I will sell 3 contracts. After every buy and sell I refigure new buy and sell prices for the next buy or sell. My book is called Here Are the Customer's Yachts and available on Amazon/Kindle. Buy my book and you'll receive a free 1-year newsletter subscription and other bonuses. The Dogs of the Dow LEAPS portfolio is up 344% I n49 months (from $60,000 to $266,000) and half your profits are in cash! ",

            "answer_text": "I don't believe in setting a price target for a stock.I set a loss limit on a stock and sell it when it hits that number.If I decide that I will accept a 6% loss then that is when I will sell it.If I decide that I will accept a 10% loss then that is when I will sell it.I will not sell it at a predetermined number, I feel that is not a good method. You can hear stories all the time such as:1. If you would have put $10,000 in ABC stock in 1990 you would have $1,000,000 in 2001. OR2. If you would have put $10,000 in XYZ stock in 1994 your would have 1.4 million by 2010. BUT, if you sold your stock when it went up 25% then you will never hit a big number no matter what happens in the future. ",
