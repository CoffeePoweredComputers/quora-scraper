            "answer_text": "There are different types of earplugs and protection. You will find a limited selection locally, but too much choice on the Internet. I use foam type earplugs because they block frequencies evenly and you can still listen to music, for example at concerts that are too loud. They also fit my oversized ear cavities, which don\u2019t seal well with silicone earplugs. Ear defenders all allow some sounds through. Humans can hear an energy range of a trillion to one, and the best ear protection is only 2,000 to one (99.95% attenuation). You need to allow some transmission for safety reasons, so you can hear alarms, traffic and Peace Officers who say \u201cput your hands where I can see them\u201d. They have been known to shoot and kill deaf people in the US for non-compliance with verbal orders! Then, there are earmuffs designed for shooting ranges, factories and airport tarmac. These look just like big circumaural wireless headphones, but with no buttons and controls. You can get them with circuits that allow conversation and block loud sounds, but that is not what you need. You can find them at gun stores, the big hardware chains like Home Depot and Lowes and industrial safety websites. If you really want silence, use both! The combination of earplug and earmuff types can give you a million to one rejection of sounds. It also sends a clear message that you can\u2019t and don\u2019t want to be interrupted by people yelling. You can also use headphones without playing music. Some, but not all, models are designed with high noise rejection, Earbuds that let sound through like Apple models don\u2019t work for noise rejection, you need \u201cIn Ear Monitors\u201d that seal. Likewise, open-back or supra-aural headphone types (on-ear) leak sound, you need the big ones that cover your ears completely. I use Beyerdynamic DT770M Pro that are studio headphones for drummers, they make great noise blockers. Finally, noise-cancelling headphones work - but not much better. I do not recommend these for listening to music (I am spoiled) but they do remove noise. The extra cost to purchase, the lower ruggedness and reliability and the requirement for batteries are all negative attributes. ",

            "answer_text": "If the noise level is dangerous for your ears, or totally distracting, a pair of memory foam type ear plugs will get you somewhere around 25dB of reduction. Learning to ignore the din of noise, like that while riding a train, or in the concourse of an airport is a good skill to learn It can become nearly like a white noise source, so long as there are no well defined sounds to catch your attention. The more you practice the skill, the easier it becomes, and the less you will need total silence to concentrate. A good skill to have in the world today! Imagine driving without being able to concentrate if there is noise around. If you are babysitting a couple of crying of boisterous children, noise levels can be fairly high. I have done it many times, and you can't tune out children completely if you want to maintain safety, though we all need to learn how to concentrate through the noises, yes? Finding one's inner calm is part of the secret, the other part is allowing stable levels of noise to become your \"babbling brook\", \"rain on the roof\", \"wind through the trees\", and let and change in the din alert you to take a moment to become aware once again. If all is okay, you begin the cycle anew. ",
