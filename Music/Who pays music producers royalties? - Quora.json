            "answer_text": "Once you\u2019ve decided that your producer is entitled to producer royalties, the next question is: how much? From my experience, the industry norm is between 2 and 5% of record sales. In the golden age of recorded music (after Elvis, before Napster), this could results in a lot of money. Think about 3% of Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller, which sold 30 million copies in the US alone (30 million times $10 per record times 3% = $9 million). And most of those records sold for far more than $10. While records don\u2019t quite sell like this any more, some do. Adele\u2019s last record sold 25 million copies, for example. So producer royalties are still a very important consideration when entering the studio. How Should Producer Royalties Be Calculated? PPD or SRLP Once you determine what percentage of record sales your producer is entitled to, the next question is: which amount does that percentage apply to? The key to answering this question is understanding the acronyms SRLP and PPD, and their differences. SRLP is the \u201csuggested retail list price\u201d, which is the approximate price charged by the retailer (Wal-Mart, your local record store, or one of the few retailers left). PPD is the \u201cpublished price to dealers\u201d, which is the approximate price that distributors charge their dealers, or the \u201cwholesale price\u201d.

            "answer_text": "Music producers get paid mechanical royalties - royalties from downloads, streaming, and/or physical sales. Those royalties are customarily paid by the record label. In the case of indie artists, they are responsible for paying producers royalties. Paying producers royalties is the RIGHT way to do business with producers. Any other way is NOT good business and robs producers of their contribution to works. If you're a producer or artist, you should work with a music publishing administration and a digital distributor that can make sure that royalties are paid out properly. One company that I know that does this is The Inaxxs Group, a music business services company that facilitates this for artists and producers a like. In the end, whether major or indie, producers should be paid royalties. ",
