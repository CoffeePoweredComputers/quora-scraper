            "answer_text": "No. Leeds United have not been a part of the Premier League since their relegation in the 2003\u201304 season. The team was in financial trouble when they were relegated and even sunk as low as EFL League One. Since then, the team has been on an upward trajectory both in terms of performances as well as financial management. Leeds United are currently at the top of the Championship with 84 points. Leeds are two points ahead and have a game in hand compared to second-placed West Bromwich Albion. With 3 more games to go, Leeds United have a good grip on the Championship title. They are now in the position to automatically qualify for the Premier League spots under the guidance of legendary Argentine coach Marcelo Bielsa. ",

            "answer_text": "Technically speaking, not yet. But I hope after knocking the door for last few seasons, this time they should finish in the top 2 to get promoted. Currently they are league toppers with 84 points from 43 games. As of now, they have 3 games left and need 4 points to secure the direct qualification. In case, they can't finish on top 2, they can still get promoted by playing the qualifying play-off. Edit:- On 17th July, West Bromwich Albion lost to Huddersfield Town which ensures Leeds United will remain in top 2 spots and thus will be promoted to EPL for 2020/21 season. ",
