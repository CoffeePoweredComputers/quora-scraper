            "answer_text": "Is about satanism, they kind of sell their souls to have more fame and money but they also have to proove it sacrificing one of the loved ones. Often accompanied by a sudden good-evil change, And indeed after his death she blew off with the Thank you Next and became like from good girl to the superbitchy girl. After that she became even more superfamous and her music became more negative, bitchy and pedo like, even a bit disturbing, promoting the agenda. A lot of people say is impossible is the drugs, and ok for sure is the drugs but is a certain kind of manipulation and putting these people in drugs and then make them depress to the point of non return. Furthermore, they still don't know who called the police saying that he was on overdose. Let s not forget Chris Cornell, let s not forget the singer of Limp Bizkit, let s not forget a lot of people that allegedly \u201csuicide\u201d or \u201coverdosed\u201d. It s a sick world. ",

It\u2019s no secret how famous she is and it\u2019s questionable how she get there. Someone had an idea with her. There are speculations that she used to wish death to her fans and then Menchester happened\u2026. I heard also that Big Sean was creeped out because her weird behavior. On the internet we can find films in which someone proves my math that Mac Miller was sacrificed and it can get on your mind. there is no official statement about cause of Mac Miller\u2019s death. He\u2019s gonna be forever in my heart. ",
