            "answer_text": "No. There\u2019s a reason K-pop is called K-pop. It\u2019s pop music, made in South Korea. By Koreans, for Koreans (and fans all around the world). Since this is music made for Koreans, writing an original song in English kills the purpose and intent of K-pop. Doing an English version of a recent hit song isn\u2019t bad, since it widens international appeal and may serve as a gateway to regular K-pop. Groups like Red Velvet, the Wonder Girls, NCT and Monsta X have English versions of past hits and tunes yet their lyrics are still written in Korean at the end of the day (past tense applies to WG). Think about it. If a group like Seventeen or BTS stopped writing songs in their language and instead started writing entire English songs to pander to Anglophone audiences, neither of them would be K-pop groups. They would just be pop groups that happen to be Korean. Now this is the K-pop equivalent of selling out and westernizing your sound. That, and not all members of the same group are fluent in English so if they tried singing an entire English song, they\u2019d still do a good job but their lack of fluency would be more noticeable if you listen closely. Or yet, there are no group members that are fluent in English (e.g. Twice). In summary, K-pop groups and bands rarely or never sing entirely in English because their home audience is the priority. The Korean market is the priority. ",
