            "answer_text": "Yes, Eddie Van Halen boiled his guitar strings, or at least did so for a period of time in his career. And he is not the only guitarist to do so. It is one of those techniques that guitarists have shared for many years. Boiling new guitar strings before you string them on your guitar will help with the stretching process as well as allow better tone and tension, thus improving the sound and playing on the guitar. It is a process though, meaning to change strings on your typical 6-string guitar goes from 10\u201315 minutes to over an hour or more. I\u2019ve tried the process before and you do have to be careful not to boil them too long or you can ruin the strings. Also if you use tap water that has lots of chemicals and minerals that will adversely affect the strings too. Cheap guitar strings also tend to become brittle and break more easily, so if you do try the technique always use high-quality strings. For me at least, I didn\u2019t find the effort resulting in that great of a reward. I just stick to high-quality strings and put them on my guitars right out of the packs. ",

            "answer_text": "Boiling strings has been one of the great myths of the guitar world since the 80s. Countless guitarists did it. The problem is it doesn\u2019t do anything. If the strings are dirty it will clean them up, and without a layer of dirt and oil from your skin it might brighten them up a tiny bit but that\u2019s it. Eddie loved playing with dead strings, so he was probably looking for ways to make dead strings last even longer and into zombie territory. lol Props to him for trying different things and he was definitely onto things when he started potting his pickups with wax, but the boiling strings he was just wrong on. The steel for strings is made at extreme temps. Steel doesn\u2019t even get bendy until it\u2019s several hundred degrees (+600F - +800F) and is molten closer to 1200F. 212F isn\u2019t doing anything to the metal. ZERO. Science! And this boiling strings thing has been disproved time and time again. ",
