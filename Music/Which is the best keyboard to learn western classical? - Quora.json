            "answer_text": "Ironically, you will probably look to the East (Japan) to Yamaha, Roland, Korg, Kawai and others (though Kurzweil, Nord and Casio make quality instruments as well). I would strongly suggest that you go to a music store and try out instruments, or try those at friends\u2019 homes or at school - get your real fingers on the keyboard and try out the sort of sounds they make. But overall - invest (meaning pay more money than for an \u201cel cheapo\u201d), invest in an 88-key instrument with weighted keys (an action that resembles that of a real wood-and-steel piano. Cheap keys look the same, but are just light plastic with a spring, and can be very tiresome to play because of their too-quick action). The instrument should be smoothly sensitive to the touch - getting a steady increase in volume as you strike the key with more velocity. Be wary of tones that suddenly become sharper or brighter when you strike them hard - they will betray you in performance (if you use your own instrument), and cause you to become gunshy on touch. In other words, you want something that feels like a big piano, but which you can (with some effort) carry under your arm. You want tones which sound like a piano over the full range of notes - especially the low tones should sound rich and full, not clanky. The high tones should blend with the low ones, and be brilliant but not harsh. If you can shell out over $1,000 U.S. you should be able to find a nice instrument. You can learn quite well on a non-weighted instrument, but you will find yourself wanting a truer feel, and might as well get a good one to start off. But 88 keys is a \u201cmust\u201d, unless your goal is to get to about book 5 of a beginner\u2019s series. ",
