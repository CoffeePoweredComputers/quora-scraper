            "answer_text": "Some do. I've found the headrests in British Airways' economy class to be quite good. Rather than the common type that has \"wings\" that flex inward and provide minimal extra support, BA's actually swivel downward and provide a solid place to support your head. I don't sleep easily in economy, but I found these to be quite a help. Economy class seats are chosen by an airline based on a number of factors, in roughly decreasing order of importance: 1) Safety, 2) Weight and size, 3) Cost, 4) Compatibility with their chosen cabin design themes, 5) Attractive features to differentiate their product, and 6) Passenger comfort.  #1 is a sort of yes/no decision. A seat is either safe enough (meaning it meets all regulatory requirements), or it's not. Airlines won't pay for extra safety margin. #2 and #3 are closely related, since weight is the enemy of fuel economy. Airlines want the lightest seat that still meets safety requirements. But that's a trade off, since removing weight from a seat design often drives up the cost.  Notice that passenger comfort is way down the list. Airlines want to be able to cram as many seats into economy class as they can, and will sometimes do so up to the point where they determine passengers are choosing to fly their competitors instead because they perceive a better value for the level of discomfort they are forced to endure.  Fancier or plusher headrests are but one feature of the many that can add costs to a seat design. An airline balances features when selecting seats, and will choose nicer headrests if they think it will get them more business. I'd suggest bringing a neck pillow along on your flights. Many people find them useful for getting some sleep in economy. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, some do provide nice headrests\u2014in the more expensive seats, like international first class. They keep less comfortable seats, with less comfortable headrests, in the cheaper seats to differentiate those two products, and most importantly, their associated fares. It may not seem very nice when you consider that they could make more comfortable seats for everyone on the plane, but at least it's an interesting example of how companies can differentiate similar products.
