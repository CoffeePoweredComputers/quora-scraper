            "answer_text": "Musicians, recording engineers, producers, etc.... this happens to just about everyone.  When you first listen to something, there is a lot of information to take in.  Your brain really can't process it all at once.  It just hears \"the song\".  After you've heard it a number of times, your ear automatically \"tunes in\" to the sounds it has been used to hearing.  But when you take a break from it, whether it's just over night or not till weeks or months later, you are now listening with a \"fresh ear\".  All the common things that your brain expects will still be there, but now it doesn't have to try and \"take it all in at once\".  There is some familiarity there.  Now it can listen a little closer to the subtle nuances of the song.  This is true as a composer, or engineer, or producer, or just a casual listener.  Also, if you listen to the same piece of recorded music on different devices, or with differently adjusted EQ, this will also bring out some of the subtle differences. ",
