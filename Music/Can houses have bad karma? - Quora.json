            "answer_text": "I don't know if it's called bad karma? But you do get houses that seem cursed. Haunted? I have my own personal experience. We went to go look at this house, and the owner was all bandaged up, with blood on him. First red flag. I asked him what happened, he told us he had to seperate a dog fight and he got in the middle of their fight, when we left I told my husband I don't believe him. There is something wrong. My husband brushed my thoughts off. He wanted to buy, but I kept warning him something wasn't right. He then took a video of the inside and outside of the house, so he could persuade me to buy. When I played the video, it was a beautiful place, but my bird went berserk, I had to turn the video off. My husband thought I was daft to take a birds opinion. Second red flag. Our bank loan was declined, yet we had sufficient money in the bank. Third red flag. Mark pushed the bank and the loan came through and we bought. 7 months later, 5 black males scaled our wall and tried murdering us. We shouldn't be alive, they were violent and just kept shooting at us. We have high walls, with high palisade on the wall, and an electric fence. So we felt safe. Still dunno how they got over? Mark and I fight non stop in this house. It's weird, we never fought until this house? I also found another story I wamt to share; Can a Home have Bad Karma? Joan Cox. -Real Estate Broker/Owner A few years ago had some clients fall in love with a home, and during the transaction found out that the Sellers were getting divorced. My Buyers closed and moved in, and all was well, for a while. They both secured new jobs with higher incomes, and needed to move closer to the job, as a 45 minute drive was too much several times a week. We sold the home, and this couple moved into their rental, while getting settled into their new jobs. Kept thinking that little townhome would get too small, and they would call letting me know they were ready for a new home. The call never came, and had checked in with them a few times. The last email stated - we are no longer in the market for a new home. THAT was pretty unsettling. Wondered what that meant, but knew someone would call/email eventually and let me know what was behind that statement. Did not take long, a couple of months later the wife called to say, they had filed for divorce, and she needed a new home, THAT weekend. Did reach out to the husband too, and touched base. That was quite the surprise! Today I get a call, and the buyers of their home - a mom and daughter that ABSOLUTELY loved the home, decided mom and daughter cannot live together as adults, even on different floors. The daughter has moved out, and they will be selling the home. OH MY! ",

            "answer_text": "usually no unless you did involve did something with it before this. but houses do have other problem such as feng shui issue (while it is superstitions to many , bad feng shui can mean your entire wealth and health luck being flush out through the toilet). another problem usually associated with house is spirits (sur offering usually will solve this problem unless the house is haunted ) . and the killing insects and having animal meats in one house . if a house can have bad karma, it would mean that karma is associated with you either individually or collectively karma. because if you do not have that karma, even if that karma ripen, it will not affect you. so for buddhist, they usually chant mantra , do a lot of good deeds. when they accumulated a lot of good merit, it can improve one life. even bad karma can be purify to a certain degree if done correctly.

            "answer_text": "Karma is related to \u201cintention\u201d. As well as action. Hence it is related to the soul and the intention of that soul. So the house can not have a bad or good karma. Karma a Sanskrit words, means action. But houses can have energy. The energy which is grabbed or accumulated through several years from the surroundings, the people who inhibited in the house from the past. So certain houses can have a bad energy (which one can feel quite strongly when you enter the place). ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting question. No, houses themselves are inanimate objects and can\u2019t have karma, however, souls who have not accepted that they have moved from the material realm can stay in surroundings they were familiar with in life. While this isn\u2019t \u201ckarma\u201d, it is sad and disturbing for the confused soul. Sensitive people who are in the house can sense the disturbed soul, hence calling a house \u201chaunted\u201d.
