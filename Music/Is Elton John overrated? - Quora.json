            "answer_text": "I find these kinds of questions difficult because of their dark overtones. Because you asked, \u201cIs Elton John overrated?,\u201d you probably already think he is and are waiting for someone to justify your answer. What I would like to say it is easy to label any musician overrated. From Mozart to The Sex Pistols, I could pick and choose specific flaws and give them a down vote. It takes a lot of guts for anyone to get on a stage, whether in their local school or in front of tens of thousands of fans and perform. I may or may not personally like their music, but I will always appreciate the effort. That holds especially true in this era where it is easier to make snarky comments behind a computer screen than perform out in the open. To answer honestly about Elton John, I would say he had the ability to compose a massive amount of songs that became quite popular. He exploited many different genres in his compositions. He puts on an intense show and is not afraid to be flamboyant on stage. He has a tremendous amount of soul in his singing and playing. No, I don\u2019t consider Elton John overrated. His longstanding popularity is enough to answer that question. ",

            "answer_text": "In what regard would you suggest that he is overrated? I\u2019m interested to know. I believe the only thing that he is rated on is, himself as a musician and a singer songwriter. Is he overrated as a musician? No. He is a very talented musician and pianist. (Despite having less than adequate fingers to do so) Is he overrated as a songwriter? No. He has a great ear for chord progression and melody which has made his lyricist, Bernie Taupin\u2019s poetic work into fantastic, popular and beautiful songs. Is he overrated as a singer? No. I don\u2019t believe that people claim that he has an unparalleled voice, but he can sing rather well and used to have a vast vocal range before he developed nodules in his throat and had to have operations. All in all I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re getting at in particular; Is he an overrated tennis player? Who knows? ",
