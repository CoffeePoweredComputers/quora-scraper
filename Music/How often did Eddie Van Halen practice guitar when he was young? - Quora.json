            "answer_text": "All day, all night. Edward was fascinated by the guitar, and would sit on the edge of his bed and play every single day. His brother and friends would go out, Friday night, mid seventies, southern California. Edward would stay behind, get a six pack of Schlitz beer, and noodle away. He has claimed that the habit of drinking 6 beers while playing every single day as a teenager, contributed greatly to his addiction issues later in life. I know Ed has struggled, and amazingly, come through the other side, and I don't want to make light of his challenges. But him woodshedding on the edge of his bed, drinking that Schlitz Malt and playing and practicing day after day, produced one of the most terrifyingly good rock guitarists that ever walked the planet.  I used to sit on the edge of my bed with a six-pack of Schlitz Malt talls. My brother would go out at 7pm to party and get laid, and when he'd come back at 3am, I would still be sitting in the same place, playing guitar. I did that for years \u2014 I still do that. Eddie Van Halen in April 1996, in an interview with Guitar World, when asked about how he went from playing his first open A chord to playing \"Eruption\". ",

            "answer_text": "As in the previous answer it's my understanding that Eddie started out playing drums and then switched to guitar. I\u2019ve never seen it stated that Alex was playing guitar when they \u201cswitched\" but it certainly makes sense. I'm also not sure I've ever actually read at what age this occured but\u2026 Both Alex and Eddie were being trained to be classical pianists as young children. For Eddie that led to the inspiration to use two hands on the fretboard and the rest, as they say, is history. So in reality, it's not ridiculous to say that he was practicing (and innovating) guitar before he ever picked one up. Who knows how many hours he put in during the learning phase? When I look back on my life it seems I spent hour after countless hour in my bedroom with a record player learning songs groove by groove. And if I'm telling the tale these days I probably exaggerate the actual numbers greatly. That happens as you get older. As for Ed, I'm guessing it was many hours every day which is an astonishing commitment for a teenager. That, coupled with his need to tinker with both his guitars and amps, makes him legendary. ",
