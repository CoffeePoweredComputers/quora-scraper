            "answer_text": "This is a super vague question, but I\u2019ll try! Ableton is pretty industry standard, so you may find the most free help on learning it, and if you ever wanted to collaborate with another artist it\u2019s more likely you would be in the same wheel house. A lot of big names such as Skrillex just to name one use it, so how bad can be? It also comes with a lot of really high quality stock plug-ins so you don\u2019t have to go around buying a bunch more. It\u2019s also been known for having a good interface if you\u2019re just using one screen. Another option is Fl studio. It is relatively inexpensive l, and it has come a long way since years ago when It had a bad rap from being pirated by a bunch of 16 year olds who flooded the internet with crappy music. Artists such as Avicii used it, and any other artists who use it claim they like how easy it is to go back and edit and fine tune the track. Also a ton of videos and communities out there to help you learn. If you have a mac another option is Logic Pro. Anything Adobe is going to provide you with all the tools you need at high quality\u2026at the right price. It\u2019s a high learning curve, and some 3rd party VSTs don\u2019t work on Mac. ",

            "answer_text": "Fruit Loops - pretty tasty one. beginnner friendly. has everything. lots of youtube templates of famous EDM songs. A lot of famous EDM, Dubstep, etc producers started with it (some have stuck to using it). Ableton - probably the sweetspot for production and performance. Expensive as EDM festivals ticket prices. i.e. VERY Logic - more of a \u2018tape\u2019/linear DAW, doesn\u2019t have clips or scenes like Ableton. Actually, quite cheap for what it offers. Grim Reaper - if you\u2019re a skint dnb or dubstep producer, or you live in a caravan or you are generally anti-capitalist, marxist, etc., good choice for you. Cheap, but I think Logic offers much more for not much more money. Logic interface does suck though - it looks like Garageband - all infantile and shit. There\u2019s almost too much choice. Hence, your question. ",
