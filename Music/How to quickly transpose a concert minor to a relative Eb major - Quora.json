            "answer_text": "The concert major and the relative minor are reciprocals. The Eb major begets the C minor and the C minor begets the Eb major. They are both tonic chords. Each of these chords creates a full sounding progression. If you line up the chords you can view the cycle. 1Ebmaj, 2 Fmin, 3 Gmin, 4 Abmaj, 5 Bbmaj, 6Cminor, 7Dmin7b5, 8Ebmaj // 1Cminor, 2 Dmin7b5, 3Ebmaj, 4Fmin, 5Gmin, 6Abmaj, 7 Bbmaj, 8Cmin // I use the numbers from 1 to 8 to complete the sound of the chord scale octaves, this makes a convenient package. Rather than using the 6th chord label, I use the 1 note label for the C minor start point. This is just my version for interchanging the numbering of the Eb major scale and its C minor counterpart. It is easier to read. The same process applies to all major scales. When you shift from the major scale forms to melodic and harmonic minor forms, you might have to do a bit of juggling. All in all, it keeps you busy! Have fun! ",
