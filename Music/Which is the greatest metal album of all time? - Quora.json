            "answer_text": "#10 - Time Does Not Heal - Dark Angel In my opinion this is the best thrash metal album every created, and doesn\u2019t need to be surpassed. Many incredible and memorable riffs (there are over 100 riffs on this album apparently). Produced to perfection, you can hear every note of every instrument. Lyrics stand out, are also memorable and touch on meaningful topics that transcend the genre. Technically speaking (intricacy of riffs, drum beats etc.) a marvel of human achievement. Altogether, I would call it a masterpiece, a real 10/10. For whatever reason, even average fans of the band don\u2019t appreciate this record because it doesn\u2019t sound like their two earlier albums. That is one of those cases where you really want to bash a person\u2019s head against the wall - some things do deserve to progress you numbskull! #9 - The Bowels of Repugnance - Broken Hope This is another personal favorite which is also maligned by the \u201cmainstream underground\u201d (lol). If I could describe this album in one sentence it would be: \u201ctotally lacking in flourishes, a completely single-minded poser-crushing riff fest\u201d. All 40 minutes of this album are death metal, and nothing else. This album, in my mind, along with its predecessor, are the purest expression of death metal that has yet come into existence. All four instruments are performed/recorded flawlessly and perfectly in the style which was intended. #8 - Burzum (1992) - Burzum First classic album from the second one-man black metal genius. His first four albums are untouchable masterpieces in my mind, have made 90% of other black metal irrelevant. Black metal basically stopped progressing after this guy went to prison. If you\u2019re wondering if I support his crack-pot politics and beliefs the answer is no. #7 - Under the Sign of the Black Mark - Bathory First classic album from the first one-man black metal genius. Took all of the first wave black metal detritus and mixed it with thrash. The album holds a ton of variety which reminds me of my #1. It\u2019s genre-defining. #6 - Master of Reality - Black Sabbath Had to include a Sabbath album. This is the best one (apart from a cringey Christian rock ballad). #5 - Altars of Madness - Morbid Angel An untouchable masterpiece of death metal canon. I can\u2019t really say anything about it that hasn\u2019t already been said. What makes this album so great? Short answer: genius guitar player + genius drummer. #4 - Denim and Leather - Saxon Very listenable and consistent album with crisp production. Admittedly, kind of a watered down Iron Maiden but I listen to NWOBHM to chill anyways so :P The flow is spot on: you don\u2019t listen to this album in a playlist, you play it from beginning to end. Good instrumentation all around and possibly the best metal vocalist of all time. #3 - Melissa - Mercyful Fate Some of the best riffing, dual guitar leads and grooves that have ever been laid to tape. Flows very well with a variety of moods and tones all fit with an audible and enhancing production job. #2 - Morbid Tales - Celtic Frost An extremely consistent album with smooth production way ahead of its time. This album caused 1,000+ metal bands to come into existence. Is that enough for you? #1 - Ride the Lightning - Metallica  To me, this is the album that defines a well-crafted metal album. The choice of songs, the quality of songs and mastering have set the standard for good metal. I seek this formula when listening to the debut or sophomore effort of a band, and have sought to emulate it in writing my own albums. ",

            "answer_text": "A definitive, objective list is probably impossible but I think we can nail down a few albums that mark the development of the genre. I confess that I hate that there are a few albums not on this list. There\u2019s no Ronnie Montrose, no Rob Halford, no Megadeath, no Sepultura and no Kiss. There\u2019s only ten spots on the list. In roughly chronological order: Cream, Disraeli Gears. In many ways this is where it starts. A strong argument for Link Wray\u2019s, much earlier, \u201cRumble\u201d as the first power cord and first distortion heavy grind but \u201cRumble\u201d was a single. Ginger Baker is a powerful, almost violent, drummer. Clapton is, well Clapton. Jack Bruce is both an incredible vocalist and a first rate bassist. Led Zeppelin, Led Zeppelin. I think this is where the highly technical metal of the 80\u2019s and into the modern era begins. Black Sabbath - tough call on this one between Paranoid and Master of Reality. I guess I\u2019ll go with Paranoid. Here\u2019s where, I think, metal gets it\u2019s inclination toward social criticism. Also, Sabbath invented doom rock and without them there is no black metal ever. Motorhead, Motorhead: Lemmy kind of invents hardcore here and lays the ground work for the future assaults of death metal\u2019s raw power and aggression. I also think you could point at Lemmy and say he might be the roots of the death growl. Rainbow, Long Live Rock and Roll. Dio, Blackmore, and Powell. on Lady of the Lake and Gates of Babylon we see Dio fantasy flavored lyrics that are still deeply entrenched in a lot of heavy metal, LA Connection and The Shed are remarkably aggressive in tone. You might be able to swap this out for Kiss Destroyer. We still see make up in the black metal world, those deep grooves are the foundations of a lot of what bands like Pantera and Five Finger Death Punch (much later) do. But man, heavy metal does love a fantasy theme\u2026 and the grooves on LA Connection and Long Live Rock n Roll are pretty strong. Metallica, Kill \u2019Em All. Thrash breaks free. Here\u2019s where we see Zeppelin\u2019s technical influence come to the fore and what Hammet, Mustaine/Hetfield, Ulrich and Burton do with it. I confess to being more a fan of Mustaine than Hammet, but the album that Metallica put together without Mustaine is an undeniable classic. Celtic Frost, To Mega Therion. Where Sabbath dug a hole and Lemmy laid a foundation for death metal, Fischer built a gothic cathedral. Here\u2019s where we see death and black metal beginning toform. Death, Scream Bloody Gore. Death metal is really born. And this is still a GREAT album. Pantera, Vulgar Display of Power. Here\u2019s where technical excellence of unbridled power and aggression first really intersect. Lamb of God and others certainly use this format later but man, this is a tasty origin of really heavy groove metal. Kyuss, Blues for the Red Sun. The modern age of metal kind of starts in the high desert (make your own jokes, folks) of California. ",
