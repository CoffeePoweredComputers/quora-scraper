            "answer_text": "The main difference is the story. In Hollywood they create the story then choose the actors according to the roles. But in Bollywood the story is created according to the heroes.  There are no much songs in Hollywood. The story is short and precise. They don't waste the time of the audience. In Bollywood when rain starts to pour there appears a song, when heroine smiles then again a song, when hero travels then a song.  In Hollywood there is no image to maintain or cold war between Top hero's they can act without showing any egos. For ex: Avengers Infinity war(All top hero's acted in a single movie.)In Bollywood that will never happen.  Star kids come straight to acting when a lot of talented People are waiting in the queue. Nepotism is the major problem in Bollywood that destroy Talent.  Too much of copycat movies, songs, Dubbed movies. They don't even have creativity to think the story. This is a sad truth.  There are a lot of dedicated Hollywood actors and they are recognised for their dedication and acting. But here those who dedicated are underrated and not recognised well.  Bollywood gives more priority to beauty not acting but in Hollywood the actresses are not qualified because of the beauty, acting is Mandatory.  In Hollywood the heroine plays the main character. Some movies depend on heroine they can take such risk. But in Bollywood it's rare. (Ex: Tomb rider, hunger games etc..In Bollywood maybe Kahani.)  In Hollywood the story is more powerful so they can spent a large amount of money in VFX too. But here no story but only depend on VFX and big Actors.   ",

            "answer_text": "I try to be pragmatic. And thus the differences of budget, equipment, lenses, or color temperature seems far too negligible to me. The main difference remains the difference of the visions and perspectives that lead Bollywood and Hollywood filmmakers and their viewers to encourage a certain type of cinema in their respective domains. I find Bollywood to be deeply tending to Romanticism and Indian Epical Classicism [1]where larger than life characters and larger than life events are celebrated more than anything else. On the other hand, Hollywood carries forward the traits of Modernism and Postmodernism compared to other tendencies[2]. But, to be noticed, we have not yet taken European or Russian cinema into account, which may be ahead of Hollywood in those very trends. However, Hollywood remains a mixture of the aspects gathered from studio system, neo-realism, noir, German-expressionism[3] and of French new wave. There cinema gets more admiration from the portrayal happenings inside-the-mind. (People don\u2019t show their emotions, they hide it - De Nero)  All those forces have transformed Hollywood into something far too away from epical classicism or romanticism, which kinda defines Bollywood. Major influences of Bollywood, even after much plagiarism and influence from world cinema, still remains Hindu gods and heroes and their larger than life images. They have those great godlike hero of the people, and overtly expressed loud emotion that remind the tradition of Notanki[4], RamLila and regional Indian performing arts. (See below: Loud and clear expressions: No need to decode)   While this had helped Indian classical arts to reach new heights, the same is taken by Bollywood as a trick to get movies commercial hit without much depth and efforts in writing, acting or direction. In other words: it has ruined Bollywood and keeps it as a factory of cheap low-fiction. (See Below: Towering characters and over overflowing emotions rule in Bollywood)  The center difference between the approaches in Hollywood and Bollywood is something that you can notice in recent movies like Logan and Dabang. LOGAN: Hollywood attempts to portray a superhero character as lifelike as possible. It is given depth via installing very basic angst of human condition. DABANG: Bollywood attempts to portray a human cop as larger than life as possible. It is shallow, it is driven by basic impulses, and it struggles with none of human issues but only conspiracies against him. -When it comes to the \u2018key-difference\u2019 I insist upon this extremely romantic perspective to be the soul of Bollywood, as opposed to a modern/postmodern, or I rather say existential, approach that we find in movies during and after the era of New Hollywood[5] filmmakers. I do not mean that those approaches are common in all their movies, but those certainly are defining traits of their most admired movies. (It must be noted that Bollywood here stands for movies of Big Production houses that go on getting celebrated widely, not the cinema of Anurag Kashyap or Vishal Bhardwaj which it still at margin. And Hollywood stands for its most celebrated filmmakers like Scorsese, Fincher and Spielberg) That be the introduction, let me exemplify in points, and first focus upon Bollywood:  Obsession with the Love Story: Love-story is to Bollywood what Marshal Art is to Chinese cinema. What makes Bollywood love stories so unreal and rather itchy is that those stories often take place in a world that does not exists on this planet. A prime example will be a movie like \u20182 States\u2019[6] where both lovers are students of IIM but neither their study, nor their classes or professors get able to find some room in the story. And still the mentions of phone-sex and a scene when both sleep together in hostel does include in the narrative. No need to remind you of the tendency of getting away from life. However, this does not even provide a good fantasy but a simple fulfillment of inner desire of a frustrated youth to serve him what he had eagerly and agitating had wished to happen. This is one reason why predictability does not become much of an obstacle to those love stories where a romantic relationship is something around which the content is cheaply wrapped, instead of romantic relationship itself being a part of the overall lifelike scenario which standard Hollywood movies will prefer and the Hollywood audience will admire, as in \u2018The Shop Around the Corner\u2019 or \u2018When Harry met Shelly\u2019. And for Bollywood, no matter what the content is, a love story is must like potato in samosa.Masala[7] : This is a word they have invented for cheap repetitive tricks to appeal to various ugly complexes of their audiences. One highlighted part that catches its audience intuitively is the item-song. It indeed represents the ugliness of a certain sector of audience which inhales all the vulgar fun of sitting in a Mumbai dance bar watching hapless girls satisfying their patriarchal perversions. What adds in it, is that the same songs are played on loudspeakers in marriages as well as on religious ceremonies at times. It would be impossible in Europe or USA to play a vulgar song during wedding, the lyrics will tear the environment apart. And this is a regular practice for an audience which finds its entertainment in chewing such masala. This is not even a guilty-pleasure, but kinda proudly-pleasure for them, dancing vulgarly on roads. And, to notice, I am not talking about exposer or nudity here, but strictly about cheapness and vulgarity, something that Miley Cyrus or Kim Kardashian stands for, in the western world.Allergy from Literature/ Industry of plagiarism : Since I am to mention about the major big productions of Bollywood containing of its top stars, this point will be mentionable. (Because during last 10 years many movies have come out of Bollywood which are innovative and promising for a better quality in coming times.) So when we look at the huge production houses, we find that they will pick a successful story from either Hollywood, European Cinema, or south Indian cinema to make it a Bollywood tadka movie. The immense ocean of Indian literature from Tagore, Mohan Rakesh, to Premchand remains untouched. Though they continue to make movies on work of Sharatchandra which he himself wished destroyed, Devdas, for its a self-destructive boneless youth.Unconcerned of Historical events: Only in Bollywood you can find a movie on an emperor as great as Akbar and all the movie circulating around his wife instead of what he did for religious unity, language or social reform Jodha-Akbar. Similarly only Bollywood can lead to touch perhaps the most important historical even of modern India, the partition,[8] the Gadar, and make a sentimental love story on it. Gadar- A love story.Hero is the God: A popular question that writers are asked in Bollywood is how much screen-time they have assigned to the hero. With the grace of the hero only, the heroine or the villain somehow find some screen-time to do something. Heroes in Bollywood are like gods, and the movies are like epical stories of gods. People want to watch their gods perform the great miracle and they need to have themselves somehow identified with this godly man. Even in regional cinema you will hear those stories where masses burn a theater because their hero is slapped or insulted in the film script. What more to say? In any coming edit, I will try to include some more very important points for Bollywood, but those few defining traits are quite a treat to look at when we want to perceive what mainstream Bollywood is and how it performs. I certainly do not count those things for a budding new wave of filmamakers who have violated those Bollywood standards and are making quality movies that stand as a hope to new era of filmmaking in India. Now look at Hollywood. Few points are mentionable. Tired of Heroic Hero: Tyler Durden, Dude Lebowski, Daniel Ocean, Daniel Plainview, Will Hunting, John Nash and Joker are the characters people talk about most in Hollywood gossips. Even when British spy James Bond had to be carved in Hollywood, it finds a face too contradicting to great hero, in the name of John McClain, an alter-image of a hero admired and loved by everyone. He is rather the man who does the job but always gets ridiculed for his too many human weaknesses. Be it an action movie, this depicts the situation of real heroes in our society much neatly. On the other hand, a hero like Neo in matrix is easily forgotten because it offers no excitement to Hollywood audience which is less interested in great hero doing the great task, in contrast to a man who faces the challenges of life, which is either a human life, a humanly life, or a reflection of it.Relationship, just a casual stuff: Relationship are a part of life and Hollywood nowadays let it remain a part of life. Scorsese, Fincher, or Coen Bros show a rather shocking or perverted face of it, and that too keeping it close to reality. While Spielberg attempts to be as near to life as possible and portray human emotions very very life like, without adding or subtracting anything from them. Nowhere we find this obsession of brooding upon relationship stuff as it happens in Bollywood.Books Inspire: Almost 80% of Scorsese or Fincher movies come from great books. This is why they walk parallel to the literature. That makes a huge difference. Even Indian fiction like Midnights Children[9] or Namesake has to find Hollywood to make a flick on it. Bollywood just cannot do it at its current stage.Concerns for History: From biblical prophecies of walking dead, to many movies on Vietnam war, infinite references to important events not just in American History but almost all that touches it, is a very strong foundations for Hollywood. Hollywood grown on cultural heritage.Characters are Characters: You find a De Nero, Brad Pitt or Tom Hanks doing a side role as many times as you want. Can\u2019t expect that from SRK or SK in Bollywood.And there you are.   (what movies I am talking about may be confusing . So just to ease it, in this answer I take FilmFare[10] winning movie as representative of Bollywood, and Oscar[11] wining movies to be Hollywood. Exceptions are always there but this marking will fit quite much to my points.)
