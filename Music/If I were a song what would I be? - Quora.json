            "answer_text": "Have to give at least 2 answers here, one instrumental piece, and one vocal. First up, Bill Evans trio with the tasty orchestration of Claus Ogerman. And here is a copy-paste of something I had written on an earlier Youtube post as to how much this piece affected me. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Although I can not say this is one of my favorite albums, the first cut from this album has to be one of my favorite moments in jazz. I first heard this piece back in 1978 or \u201879, well past mid-night, in an office of a cancer research lab in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. No, I was neither a scientist nor a researcher, just another student taking philosophy courses at Chapel Hill, living with my Japanese girlfriend, and working as a night shift guard overlooking the lab rats\u2019 environmental control monitors. It was a late-night-to-early-morning shift, not much pay, but lots of solitude and time to read. But most of all, time to listen to NPR interviews, commentaries, and jazz. That was the first time I heard this piece. As was the NPR radio format at that time, several unrelated selections of jazz were played, and only afterwards, the velvet voiced announcer would mention a list of the artists and the pieces they played. But even before I knew who the artist was, I remember being particularly caught up in the music coming from those tiny radio cassette speakers. I was lucky I was recording on a blank cassette at the time. I still have that cassette. The flip side has a cherished recording of Leonard Feather announcing an electrifying performance of Airto and Flora Purim \u2014 Live at the Hollywood Bowl, and Hermetu Pascoal \u2014 Live at Montreux. I searched for that Bill Evans piece in the shops now and then, but as a jazz neophyte, had no idea of how to find it. This was before the age of the internet and all I knew was that this was Bill Evans. Since that time, I have found a lot of great jazz (including one of my favorite albums, 'Bill Evans Trio with Symphony Orchestra) and (thanks to Airto, Flora, & company) I had discovered the equally rich heritage of Brazilian music. But it would be a couple of decades later, in an Akihabara music shop here in Japan, that I finally stumbled across a Bill Evans album I had never seen before. Having just been re-released on CD, I bought it on a whim, and to my delight, it began with that very piece I had been searching for. I never tire of the vivid picture Bill has painted with this opening number. When I listen to that first cut, I don\u2019t feel like I am 'listening to music\u2019. It is more like I am watching a heart-rendingly truthful autobiography unfold \u2026 first painful and beaten \u2026the spare, stabbing, short passages of dissonant harmonies, a melody line hesitant and meandering as if bumping into the spiked wall\u2019s of life\u2019s maze. But that intermittent pain and probing uncertainty only pulls into sharp contrast the sure and certain path he is about to forge from the darkness, and fasten into wings in his first attempts to rise above it all. First skipping, then running \u2026 a short touch and go on the tarmak \u2026 and then lifting off for good, soaring over over the vapor-trail-prodding and accelerating push of an intimately connected rhythm section \u2026 throbbing through an astringent, blue-sky orchestration merely hinted at through Ogerman\u2019s string section \u2026 soaring in a maiden-voyage triumph with the sharp and sweeping gaze blessed only to a raptor now spreading his wings. I know that I am missing out on some other interesting things happening on that album, some of which I will never be able to understand. But I am content to stop the CD at 7:56, sit in silence, and bathe in a glimmer of hope of things to come in my own life\u2019s accelerating crescendo.  The second piece, the original recording with Tom and Elis in Brasilian Portuguese, has just the perfect blend of depth and whimsy and joy.  Nothing beats the original (above), but for we Portuguese-challenged \u2026  ",
