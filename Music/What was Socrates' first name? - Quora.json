            "answer_text": "I can add a little to the points above. Basically, if we were engaged in familiar conversation with Socrates, we'd simply address him as S\u014dkrat\u0113s, \"Socrates\" \u2013 by far the most common usage in Plato's dialogues. In more formal (or mock-serious) contexts, we might add his patronymic (father's name): S\u014dphroniskou, \"[Son of] Sophroniscus\". To get more formal still, we might add his demotic name, referring to his district of origin: \"Al\u014dpek\u0113then\" or \"from [the deme of] Al\u014dpeke. Something like a \"full name\" in our sense would resemble \"Socrates, son of Sophroniscus, from Alopeke\" \u2013 S\u014dkrat\u0113s S\u014dphroniskou Al\u014dpek\u0113then. In a bit more detail, the two core elements of a personal name in (most of) classical Greece were (1) the given name and (2) the patronymic (father's name). For example, Socrates was (according to the ancient tradition) the son of a stonemason called Sophroniscus. So he could be called S\u014dkrat\u0113s S\u014dphroniskou (literally \"Socrates of Sophroniscus\", i.e. Socrates, Sophroniscus' [son]). In the Platonic dialogues, Socrates is usually addressed by his given name (S\u014dkrat\u0113s) in casual conversation, but sometimes by his father's name (for example, Laches 180D: \"O son of Sophroniscus\"), which can offer variation in conversation, or suggest (often in play) a more formal or respectful context. Depending on the situation, a third element could be added: (3) an ethnic or demotic name, denoting the person's place or community of origin. In fifth-century BCE Athens, where Socrates was a citizen, the local usage often referred to a \"deme\" or district of Attica. Socrates' deme was Alopeke, and he's addressed (mock-seriously) in one of the Platonic dialogues by his demotic name (Gorgias 495D). If we were outside Attica, elsewhere in the Greek world, we might add (or simply state) that Socrates was from the city of Athens in general. The Lexicon of Greek Personal Names project has a nice online summary of how the names are constructed, if useful: http://www.lgpn.ox.ac.uk/names/practices.html ",

            "answer_text": "Greeks of that era tended to be known by a single name.  If there was confusion, they might adopt a qualifier, such as the town that they were from or their occupation, or perhaps from their father's name. So you could say that Socrates was his first name, or rather, his given name.  There have been other people named Socrates before and since.  If there were others running around Athens at the time, they might all turn around if you yelled out the name. The Greeks tended to be fairly clever about their namings.  (Unlike the Romans, who only had a small pool of given names to draw on, including resorting to just numbering their children.)  Socrates was named for \"Isokratos\", \"equal power\" (the same \"kratos\" that makes up the word \"democratic\", \"power of the people\").  This freedom in naming meant that there wouldn't have been all that many people with the same name around. ",
