            "answer_text": "None. Why would they want to be in a boy band? That is so unbelievably gay on so many levels it's astounding. Also, boy bands, pop artists, rap artists, etc., never last. They always fail. To this day millions listen to Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Alice in Chains, Slayer, As I Lay Dying, and countless other extremely talented bands. Why? Because their music is relevant and meaningful. Quality lasts lifetimes. My children will grow up listening to Maiden, as well as my grandchildren. All the pop stars you hear today won't exist in a year. Also, millions of kids with no understanding of music and the music industry want to do the same. So no, you guys don't have a fighting chance in hell. If you want to do it as a hobby and make some form of disgusting music, go for it. But don't expect it to take off because half of the world is doing the same thing. ",
