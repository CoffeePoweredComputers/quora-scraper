            "answer_text": "The reality is that Broadway now caters to three audiences. They are The Old Guard. These are the old, wealthy (mostly white) people who have the money to drop not only on tickets, but on producing shows. If they want another damn Rogers and Hammerstein revival, they will get their Rogers and Hammerstein revival, because they have the money to finance such an endeavor, and their friends will come to see it.The Theatre Nerds. I firmly fall into this category. Theatre nerds are the young, earnest types, many of whom dream of one day working on Broadway, and we absolutely eat up whatever theatre we can get. And I say whatever theatre we can get because many of us depend on the goodwill of our more affluent family and friends to see this theatre we love so much. Broadway tickets and trips to New York are expensive, and not a lot of young people have the expendable income to be seeing it night after night, even with student rush rates and lotteries.Tourists. This is the big one. Broadway basically is to Theatre as DisneyWorld is to Amusement Parks. It is the cr\u00e9me de la cr\u00e9me, the guaranteed gold standard of quality, and it relies mainly on people who don\u2019t live in the area shilling out the money for a short time with the promise of a great experience. And whether it\u2019s a family from the midwest whose children desperately want to see their favorite Disney movie live, or a group of tourists who speak English as a second language, having a show that\u2019s based a pre-existing intellectual property everyone knows and loves is a pretty good way to guarantee there will be butts in seats. When the bottom line is money, originality takes a backseat to profitability.It\u2019s also worth noting that original musicals, when they do come along, often live and die by their awards showing. Dear Evan Hansen is now two years into its run after having split a sweep of the 2017 Tony Awards with the Hello, Dolly! revival (much to the chagrin of myself and every other fan of Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812). Though the mention of Great Comet begs the question of what is considered a truly \u2018original\u2019 musical? Hadestown could be considered such, but it is an adaptation of the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. Head Over Heels was a jukebox musical set to the songs of the Go-Go\u2019s and based on Sir Philip Sidney\u2019s Arcadia, but its book had only the bare minimum in common with its source material. Hamilton is based on the eponymous Ron Chernow biography, but said biography was most certainly not conceived with a diverse cast of actors performing hip-hop in mind. Hell, even the SpongeBob SquarePants musical was incredibly creative in how it took familiar characters and put them in a new environment and created an highly dramatic story with intense stakes. And if you wanted to get really cynical, you could argue that there are only Seven Basic Plots that keep getting redone over and over again, so really, nothing on Broadway is original. ",

            "answer_text": "There are lots of reasons for this. The other comments get into some of them, but I want to focus on something they haven\u2019t really touched on. Musicals are incredibly expensive to produce today. Whereas it used to be possible for a single producer to go to a (relatively) small handful of investors and get enough money to put a show on Broadway, now that isn\u2019t possible. They need many investors\u2014sometimes dozens\u2014to get shows on. And the more people have money involved, the more who can stick their fingers in the pie, the more problems are likely to result. And\u2014this is critical\u2014the less likely anyone will be to take risks. When you have to return, in some cases, $20 million to your investors, you want to make sure there\u2019s a darn good chance they will get their money back. This means choosing safe shows. Revivals of proven hits. Jukebox musicals where the audience doesn\u2019t have to worry about liking the songs. Off-Broadway shows that made a big splash downtown and got lots of press. Truly original Broadway shows are risky: No one knows what they are, if people are willing to like them, and whether there\u2019s likely to be a return on the investment. And that much risk makes it a lot harder to get the money needed to put on those shows. As a result, we get fewer of those, all while we get a lot more of the safer stuff. Will things always be this way? Probably not. They haven\u2019t always been. But until someone figures out a way to either fix the economics of Broadway or work within them to do something amazing, we\u2019re going to have to put up with it. I think that, when/if there\u2019s less on the line, you\u2019ll start seeing bolder stuff again\u2014you still do Off-Broadway, where shows are cheaper (though the scene there has changed a lot, too, for similar reasons). No one wants this more than I do, but a lot of change is required in a lot of areas for this to reasonably happen. ",
