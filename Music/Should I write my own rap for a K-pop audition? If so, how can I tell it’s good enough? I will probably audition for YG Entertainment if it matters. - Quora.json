            "answer_text": "I definitely think that\u2019s a good idea, that will give you an advantage if you can write your own music, they will more likely be interested if you can show them something no one else has. Listen I know that people spend so long over analyzing and over thinking something that means a lot to them and it ends up being something different because we want to change it, it will never be perfect just like everything else in this world, the only way you can know if it\u2019s good enough is if you believe it is, if you don\u2019t thunk it\u2019s good enough try again, when you are writing music make sure that it has meaning and that it connects with you in some way, don\u2019t write about some random thing you know nothing about, make sure it has rhythm and that it stays on track and stays on pitch, make sure it\u2019s catchy and preform with emotion, don\u2019t look static and boring rap with emotion make the emotions come out of the judges, be yourself and don\u2019t give up if you don\u2019t succeed, I know that\u2019s hard to follow but if you want to do this be strong and BELIEVE in you!

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s definitely an advantage if you write your own music and/or lyrics since YG\u2019s artists are known to be good with producing and writing. But, it is just as risky. If you can\u2019t write good lyrics, then instead of getting plus points, you can be downvoted by the judges. So, if you\u2019re a foreigner learning korean then I recommend that you don\u2019t write korean lyrics. Writing good korean rap lyrics as a foreigner can get you major advantages but it\u2019s not that easy. You can write the lyrics in English too if you want. It\u2019s hard for Koreans to write good rap lyrics, but it\u2019s even harder and riskier for foreigners. (And also never use a translator, they translate everything sound stiff and abnormal lol) And onto how you know if it would be enough.. you can show it to your friends or post it online to get opinions. Criticism from other people can improve your lyrics. Also, rhyming is good in a rap but make sure the lyrics actually makes sense when you just read it lol. ",
