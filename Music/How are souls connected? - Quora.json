            "answer_text": "Souls are connected via the Source energy, All That Is - since all of them are parts of the Source energy on their journey through the Universe and all its realms. However, there are some specific connections that link some souls with each other. Birth of Souls. Souls are born from a Monad - the last unit of energy before individual souls are created. My research with hypnosis subjects shows that souls can be born alone, with a Twin Flame or in a group - and sometimes these groups have several couples in them. The Twin Flame connection is the strongest one between 2 souls, and the next would be the connection with all the members of the original \u201cborn together\u201d group, like \u201csoul multiples\u201d. Some of these groups continue for ages as one consciousness collective, where all members are bonded by telepathic links.Souls\u2019 history and reincarnations - souls who reincarnated together are bound by their mutual experiences traveling across the Universe and reincarnating on different worlds and planets. The Original Group or the Twin Flames can stay together in reincarnations or split apart, and the souls who were born alone meet many different beings on their journey and create bonds with some of them. This explains why there are opposite views on how Soul Groups are created - in Michael Newton\u2019s books, Soul Groups are created at the birth of souls, as splitting of the energy unit into several souls - which I also see occasionally in my research. But in Edgar Cayce\u2019s readings, he stated that Soul Families are created in incarnations - souls meeting each other in lives and creating bonds. It seems both are views correct, it just depends on the type of soul birth. Soul Groups also stay together between incarnations for study, enjoyment, and planning future lives.Souls\u2019 interests and occupations. After souls gain some experience in incarnations they start showing interests and talents and chose \u201csoul occupations\u201d which unite them into schools, professional organizations, clubs by interest, creative groups, etc. We can\u2019t exactly call it \u201ca job\u201d as there is no monetary exchange in the Spirit World - but we see schools, hospitals, governing bodies, counseling centers, libraries, entertainment venues in the Spirit World, where souls \u2018work\u201d between physical incarnations, or can practice any kind of art, music or science. In my sessions, I mostly deal with Healer Souls, or occasionally Specialist Guides who help incarnated humans in their professional endeavors. There are any occupations imaginable in the Spirit World and souls can form professional bonds and carry them into human incarnations - they would usually incarnate as colleagues or people united by the same passion or interest.Spiritual hierarchy defies relationships between Spirit Guides and their incarnating Students, Guides are also in training with higher level Guides and Ascended Masters. There are all kinds of Councils in the Spirit World - some are educational, others govern star systems, galaxies, star races, etc. There is often \u2018chain of command\u201d in relationships between souls - it mostly applies to incarnations, but there seems to be some sort of spiritual hierarchy also, as some souls have more power due to their wisdom and experience and can have a say in what souls can or can not do in the Spirit World and also in physical lives\u2026.",

            "answer_text": "I have recently come to the astounding conclusion \u2018All\u2019 souls are connected to one another and connected to the \u2018ultimate source of unconditional love\u2019. That is so incredible because that means every soul has an infinite number of connections. So, why isn\u2019t our \u2018switch board\u2019 so jammed that all we get is continuous \u2018static?\u2019 The connections vary in strength by degree. In other words, we choose which connections we want to enhance or strengthen for a particular experience or set of experiences. The ubiquitous connections were established as part of the origin of Creation. We began as a profound unity and have continued as a profound unity, even though within the unity is the combined infinity of all soul experience. We actually diminish the strength of connections by accepting a belief (usually taught or given to us by others) that we are disconnected and connections are impossible. My experience has been I could \u2018make connections\u2019 by consciously expressing a desire to \u2018connect with so & so (my best guess of how to refer to the source I wanted to contact).\u2019 My problem usually came after I connected and received the input I was looking for. At times I had trouble believing the input I was given because it was almost too incredible to believe. May you find the love, joy, and peace through the shortest route. ",

            "answer_text": "In order to address this question properly a brief explanation of what is the soul is appropriate . The human soul is that part of the constitution of man that develops after the creation of the physical body by our parents.Its nature is non material ,it develops in accordance to the human spiritual progress ,it\u2019s the future vehicle or place of the personalty in the afterlife ,can\u2019t be detected. Also could be said is the spiritual counterpart of an individual human in development instigated by the indwelling spirit of God the Father in collaboration with the human mind. If you are referring to that general belief of the soul mates ,it\u2019s only a superstition.Souls are not connected. Affinity of personalities,is just that ,not to confuse with anything that it is not. ",
