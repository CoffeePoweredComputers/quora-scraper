            "answer_text": " Lieutenant Selar on Star Trek: The Next Generation. While the show focused on the chief medical officer, a ship the size of the Enterprise, with a crew of 1014, has more than one doctor on its medical staff. Dr. Selar was one of those doctors. We only saw her in one episode - the season two episode \u201cThe Schizoid Man\u201d. In that episode, the Enterprise has to handle two missions. They are enroute responding to a distress call from a highly respected scientist named Ira Graves, requesting medical aid, when they pick up another distress call, from a transport ship called the Constantinople. The Constantinople has experienced a hull breach and has 2012 people on board. The chief medical officer (Dr. Pulaski) requests to go to the Constantinople and recommends Dr. Selar to handle Ira Graves\u2019 medical needs. I don\u2019t know why the writers did that - maybe the actress that played Dr. Pulaski (Diana Muldaur) wasn\u2019t available for most of the episode filming. Regardless, it introduced us to Dr. Selar. I believe she was the first Vulcan that we saw on Star Trek: The Next Generation (or at least the first to have dialogue). Apparently Gene Roddenberry felt that Vulcans were a bit one note and that that note had been sufficiently played on the original series. I was excited to see another Vulcan and found Dr. Selar delightful. I was disappointed we never saw her again. I don\u2019t know why they never featured her again. It certainly wasn\u2019t because the producers didn\u2019t like the actress or the actress didn\u2019t want to be on the show, because the actress, Suzie Plakson, returned to Star Trek multiple times as other characters. She played Klingon emissary K\u2019Ehleyr (Worf\u2019s baby mama) that same season and again in season four. She also played the female Q on Star Trek: Voyager, and an Andorian (Tarah) on Star Trek: Enterprise. Maybe after establishing her as such an important character as K\u2019Ehleyr, they felt it might confuse people to have her play Dr. Selar again. Our loss. ",
