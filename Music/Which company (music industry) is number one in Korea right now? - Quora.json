            "answer_text": "YG, according to the numbers of revenue from albums sold last year with Big Hit in second\u2026 however\u2026 Big Hit made their numbers with one global kpop group and a handful of smaller solo artists, BTS making up 90% of their sales while YG's revenue numbers are based on a medium sized group of kpop groups with mediocre popularity in comparison to Big Hit with BTS. If it were based on their top sell group, Big Hit would be number one by far just with BTS as YG's top group came no where close to BTS' sales numbers. ",

            "answer_text": "Big Hit Entertainment is speculated to be valued at 900 B to 1 Trillion won right now, meaning it is valued the highest (YGE and SME are both valued around 25 B won, and JYPE at 18 B won). However, Big Hit is not publicly traded, and since they only have BTS and soon TXT, they are more vulnerable to swings in the market than companies like SME with many artists. ",
