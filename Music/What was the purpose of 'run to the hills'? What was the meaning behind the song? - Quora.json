            "answer_text": "It\u2019s about the colonial Europeans coming to America and the interactions with the native Americans. It deals with it from the native American point of view, with the Europeans seen as invaders. The narrator tells the story \u201cWhite man came across the sea He brought us pain and misery He killed our tribes, he killed our creed He took our game for his own need We fought him hard, we fought him well Out on the plains, we gave him hell But many came, too much for Cree Oh, will we ever be set free? Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes Galloping hard on the plains Chasing the redskins back to their holes Fighting them at their own game Murder for freedom, a stab in the back Women and children and cowards attack\u201d So this part is telling the tale of white people killing the tribes of native north Americans, who are fighting back to protect themselves, their family, and their land. However, then we go to the second part \u201cSoldier blue in the barren wastes Hunting and killing's a game Raping the women and wasting the men The only good Injuns are tame Selling them whiskey and taking their gold Enslaving the young and destroying the old \u201c Here we see the description of the invaders as soldiers, and the way that they treat the native population. The narrator and his tribe want to fight, but realise that they can\u2019t win, and so run to the hills to hide. This was a theme examined by several rock bands in the late 70s and early 80s. As well as this song there is White Man by Queen, and Savage by Judas Priest, that all deal with the same theme of the idea of the barbarism of the colonisation by Europeans, juxtaposed with the image of the savage native.
