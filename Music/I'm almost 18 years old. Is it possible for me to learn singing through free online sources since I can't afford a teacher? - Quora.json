Maintain your throat This is essential to sing better each time. Gargle with hot water to keep the throat clean. Drink plenty of water. Avoid shouting or speaking in tones that can affect your voice. Eat foods that are soothing for the throat. Avoid eating too hot or too cold foods. Stay away for spicy, greasy foods.

Think down for High Notes The next time you sing an ascending vocal scale or you sing a high note, try thinking of the way an elevator works. A heavy weight is attached to a pulley and as the weight pulls down, the elevator actually goes up to the higher floors. So, the highest floor is reached when the weight is the heaviest. Similarly, you should think down for your high notes or think of adding weight (resistance) to your highest notes. #3. More Power without Strain Who doesn\u2019t want more power without strain? This is a simple technique to apply and a bit easier than the one above. All you have to do is to keep your chin pointed slightly down and your pectorals slightly flexed (well sometimes it\u2019s a lot flexed) when you go for more power. Most singers reach forward or lift their chin up to sing with more power. While it may temporarily work, it causes vocal problems. Tipping your chin down not only works better and saves your voice \u2013 it actually SOUNDS better! Stand in front of the good \u2018ol mirror. Sing an Ah scale up and down in one phrase (1\u20132\u20133\u20134\u20133\u20132\u20131). Press your chin slightly in (point your chin towards the floor) \u2014 usually only 1\u201d or so. Don\u2019t let your head bob up as you raise the pitch. Keep it firmly in place. Go all the way up the scale of your voice keeping this position. Notice how your chin wants to move up as you raise your pitch. Keep it planted. This will give you more power and control and eliminate strain. Practice it until it becomes natural! #4. How to Get Natural Vibrato In Your Voice Here\u2019s a quick tip to get your vibrato working. Stand in front of a mirror; press on your chest with both hands, then, raise your chest higher than normal. Take a breath in and then exhale, but don\u2019t drop your chest. Sing one note and hold it as long as possible with your chest raised. Press on your chest halfway through the note (press kind of hard and raise your chest to meet the pressure). Relax the back of your neck and keep your jaw open as you\u2019re singing \u201cahhh.\u201d Imagine the air spinning around in your mouth while keeping your chin tucked down a bit and your chest raised. Keep in mind, overuse of vibrato is not a good thing in contemporary singing (pop, rock, and R&B). At the same time, no vibrato is also not a good thing. So, try ending phrases with straight tone, then into a little bit of vibrato. The bottom line is to do what\u2019s best for you. #5. HearFones A good vocal tone is not established by singing loudly, it\u2019s established at medium volume. Good tone happens when vocal folds are strong enough to have a good closure but not touch. Releasing too much air creates a \u201cbreathy\u201d tone and releasing too little air creates a \u201cnasal\u201d tone. Unless you\u2019re really going for breathy or nasal as a stylistic choice, somewhere right in between the two is a perfect balance. ",
