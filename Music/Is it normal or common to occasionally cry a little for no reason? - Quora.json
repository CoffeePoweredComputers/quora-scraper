            "answer_text": "What are tears? They are a form of expression. Sometimes happiness is so strong that it reflects in the form of tears. Sometimes we are so sad and confused that we have nothing but tears rolling down our eyes. But is it normal to cry for no reason? It is only if we know the reason for our tears. Tears are an untold expression of a person who is oblivious to the power of expression and speech. Sometimes we are so overwhelmed in a situation that we have nothing but tears rolling down our eyes. Hence it is important to know the reason for our tears. Crying for no reason, makes one oblivious to the real reason of this powerful emotion. Personally speaking, Yes I was so sad sometime back that I would cry myself crazy. Deep down I had reasons, but I was unable to figure out what was the reason. It could have been single but sometimes they are multiple. You see like cells, problems multiply and rarely divide, but it\u2019s our ability to learn to deal with them and divide. When i studies why i was crying, I figured out there were multiple reasons as I have mentioned in the prior questions answered. With the help of this realization I realized that without knowing it, i was slowly heading into confusion and depression. And trust me, there is nothing more worst than depression. You can take medication, whatever but it\u2019s only cure is yourself! How you face it, and how you plan to conquer it. If your crying, personally I think there is something in you-a problem, which was once small and manageable, but unfortunately now it is becoming larger for you to handle and hence comes the silent expression-tears. Hence in my opinion and as an unknown adviser, I recommend find the reason for your tears. They are definitely not positive, for if it would have been the surge to the feeling would have been incredible. My advice, talk to people close to you. share your feelings, your lost drivetake time out from your schedule. write down your feelings, your plus and your negative.weigh the two. what has more weight, and what is having a more effect on your expressions.once you know it, you know the reason for your tears.next work on the solutions on how to change it.Anything is possible, if you have faith in yourself Take care \u201cGod is kind and hope is a beautiful thing.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "It isn\u2019t uncommon for individuals to cry for no reason. The human psyche is a highly complex mechanism and is witness to many maladies . A large portion of the human psyche is still uncharted , just when we think we have figured out human emotions we discover that there is much more to it than just merely utilizing one specific therapy . Utilizing a mixture of therapies sometimes works better than just one proposed therapy ! The human mind is like an iceberg , most of the iceberg is underwater and can\u2019t be seen , the same goes for our mind. A person crying for no reason may be sensitive to their surroundings and not know it. Some individuals may be in a similar situation ( ambience and surroundings) and it may be similar to another scenario that was experienced in the past when they were confronted with crying . Although many psychologists may disagree with me ( I\u2019m not a standard psychologist) but I knew someone who was crying which seemed to be for no reason and couldn\u2019t explain it , she said something doesn\u2019t feel right, and a week later her best friend died . Some of us have an extra sensory connection with friends and family . However , this has been a rarity. It could also be that we have been under pressure and tension and don\u2019t recognize it and it comes out as tears of relief. Sometimes our body has a mind of its own and does things that we don\u2019t directly comprehend and so it does some autonomic things because it finds it necessary since we are not engaging in a conscious effort in dissipating tension. Crying relieves tension. ",
