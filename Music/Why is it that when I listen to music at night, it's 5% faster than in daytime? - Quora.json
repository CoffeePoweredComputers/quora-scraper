            "answer_text": "Because your perceptual time is different. After waking your mind is slower and takes a while to get up to speed, so the music tempo is relatively faster. This may be an indication that you are night person, descended from night hunters. How well do you see in the dark? I find that my mind \u201cwakes up\u201d when the sun goes down. My best thoughts and work have been after midnight. If I have no fixed schedule, I follow the moon and the tides. ",

Well, personally I\u2019ve not noticed that, and I\u2019ve never heard a question like it proposed before by anyone. So either you\u2019ve discovered a completely new scientific phenomenon, or - more likely - this is a subjective experience about which you\u2019ve drawn an inference (ie, that other people have the same experience). Your first step on a scientific quest for validity is therefore to rephrase your question to: \u201cHas anyone else noticed that music sounds faster in the morning and slower at night?\u201d If you get some takers, then you might have some idea as to whether or not it\u2019s worth pursuing. If not, then maybe you should just keep quiet about it\u2026 ",
