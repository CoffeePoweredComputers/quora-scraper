            "answer_text": "People play fast and loose in the use and interchangeability of soul music and R&B music. Being as clinical as possible, R&B music (rhythm and blues) is a euphemism for African-American popular music. Every form of African-American music that isn't jazz, traditional blues, or hip-hop falls under the umbrella of R&B: early rock and roll, doo wop, soul, funk, disco, contemporary R&B aka \u201curban contemporary\u201d, new jack swing, hip-hop soul, neo-soul, etc. \u201cSoul musuc\u201d is a subgenre of R&B that emphasizes an earthier sound with a strong influence of African-American gospel: soul shouting, melismatuc cicalizatoib, call-and-response, emphasis on the piano and drums versus guitars, and a sometimes imperceptible but never overwhelming amount of grit. Pretty much all R&B music recorded between 1964 and 1980 is labeled \u201csoul music\u201d by many, though some of those recordings (The Supremes, for example) test the boundaries. The sounds of Aretha Franklin, much of the Stax roster (Otis Redding, Isaac Hayes, Carla Thomas, Sam & Dave), Roberta Flack, Gladys Knight, The O\u2019Jays, and many more are the most indicative of what soul music sounds like at its core. A few modern artists, like Maxwell, D\u2019Angelo, Jill Scott and the late Sharon Jones, still make soul music rather than contemporary R&B, which has a slicker, more pop-influenced feel. Both Sam Cooke and James Brown are considered soul music artists; Cooke is in fact hailed by some as \u201cThe Man Who Invented Soul,\u201d though Ray Charles, Etta James, and James Brown (who is also one of the men who helped invent funk as well) certainly assisted in that invention, among others.

            "answer_text": "EDIT: Quora merged two questions, editing out these relevant details from the question I answered: \u201cWatched a great documentary about Sam Cooke, and it referred to him as a soul musician. I\u2019d thought of Soul and R&B as interchangeable, with \u201cSoul\u201d maybe being a smooth subgenre of R&B. But the doc referred to James Brown as the \u201cKing of Soul\u201d, yet James Brown doesn\u2019t sound anything like Sam Cooke.\u201d Soul is a collection of sub-genres of R&B, differentiated from the other sub-genres by a greater influence from gospel music. When an R&B song sounds like it would be at home in the church if you swapped out the subject with God, Jesus, or Mary, then it is probably soul music. Many of the greatest soul singers such as Sam Cooke, Aretha Franklin, Al Green and James Brown were originally gospel singers or became gospel singers after their secular careers. R&B is a huge and diverse genre just like rock music (in fact it spawned rock music, and hip hop) and similarly it has many sub-genres. Several of these can be classified as soul including classic soul, southern soul, Philly soul, smooth soul and Chicago soul. Other genres of R&B include jump blues, New Orleans R&B, doo-wop, funk, disco, post-disco, quiet storm, new jack swing, and contemporary R&B. What sets the soul sub-genres apart from the others is the focus on soulful, gospel influenced vocals. James Brown is most known for funk music, which he originated beginning in 1965 with \u201cPapas Got a Brand New Bag\u201d and \u201cI Got You\u201d and really solidified in 1967 with \u201cCold Sweat.\u201d This could be the most important moment in the history of R&B. All R&B artists since owe a debt to James Brown However the reason he is known as \u201cThe Godfather of Soul\u201d is that more than a decade prior to inventing funk, James Brown was, incredibly, also one of the pioneers of soul music. In the mid \u201850s, along with Ray Charles, James Brown had some of the earliest soul music hits, soon followed by Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson and the Drifters*. If you wonder why James Brown is known as the godfather of soul despite not sounding like Same Cooke, check out his \u201954 song \u201cPlease, Please, Please\u201d and his \u201956 hit \u201cTry Me.\u201d They are very different from his funk songs people are more familiar with. For more great soul, in addition to the aforementioned artists music check out: Otis Redding (Southern Soul) Percy Sledge (Southern Soul) Wilson Pickett (Southern Soul) Al Green (Smooth Soul, Memphis Soul) Marvin Gaye (Smooth Soul, his 70s music. In the 60s he was Motown) Earth, Wind & Fire (Smooth Soul, Funk, Disco, Quiet Storm\u2026) The O\u2019Jays (Philly Soul) The Spinners (Philly Soul) Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes (Philly Soul) There are many more great soul singers but these are my personal favorites *The Drifters soul music period was from 1959\u20131965. Prior to that they were a Doo-Wop group James Brown - A medley of Papas Got A Brand New Bag & I Got You, 1966  James Brown - Cold Sweat  James Brown - Please, Please, Please  James Brown - Try Me  ",
