            "answer_text": "According to John\u2019s diaries, which were considered accurate, John slept with Linda. Perhaps where some of their animosity came from, because John most likely told Paul. Apparently John\u2019s diaries were stolen and Yoko sued to get them back. The story went that John came over to see Paul, he wasn\u2019t home but Linda was, she invited him in and they ended up in bed. It has been said that Linda was first attracted to John and Paul himself admitted that John was originally her favorite Beatle. Apparently, Linda felt bad about it in the end. They were folding sheets together. So, it made sense to me when Paul said John was worried about him sleeping with Yoko. John called Linda \u201cunattractive\u201d and clearly did not like her. Perhaps, John did so to show Paul that type of person she was. Then used it to get under his skin after the way Paul treated him and Yoko. If anyone knows the back story to when Linda slept with Paul\u2019s friend Stash they would understand more clearly who Linda really was: \u201cThat weekend, she tried calling him at home and got Stash on the line instead. He told her Paul was in Liverpool. Unfazed, Linda said she wanted to come over anyway. So she did \u2014 and promptly fell into bed with Stash. It was a bizarre weekend. While Stash and Linda were rolling around together, Paul phoned to tell his lodger to move out. So Stash took Linda to stay with the musician Graham Nash. And soon their affair was common knowledge in London\u2019s rock community. \u2018I was teased extensively by Roger Daltrey and [Jimi] Hendrix and so on, because, youknow, Linda had gone around,\u2019 says Stash. John also told Fred Seaman, who was John\u2019s personal assistant, driver and companion from 1979 to his death, that Paul hit Linda. And, there are some on here that get mad at me when I repeat what\u2019s crystal clear. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably not so much as unlike Paul who had at least attempted to be respectful to Yoko for John's sake, John made no such attempt with Linda seeming at times to go out of his way to insult her. Such as stating his opinion she just wasn't pretty enough for Paul. But then John hadn't really liked Jane Asher either until of course Paul and she ended. I don't think it bothered Linda much by that time as it was pretty evident that The Beatles were on life support and in their final breaths. I suppose Brian Epstein had it right all of those years before when he said John was the brain. Paul was the heart. George was the soul. Ringo was the body and blood. The brain was dead and gone. The soul had fled. The body and blood was dying. The heart just wasn't strong enough to keep going on it own and was on life support. It was inevitable that the plug would have to be pulled. So whether John liked Linda or she liked John or not was inconsequential and insignificant in the bigger scheme of things, Paul loved her and she loved him, he was a great father to little Heather and those are the things that really mattered wouldn't you say? John had given her very few reasons to like him. He was originally her favorite Beatle however, when she was just a fan and before she got to actually know any of them.  ",

Lee Eastman was a well-respected American lawyer, specializing in entertainment law. After she and Paul got together, he made an attempt to get Lee onboard the Apple team (I think as manager, since Epstein was gone). The band already had a LOT of issues, and there was a lack of the unanimity which had always been behind their decisions. The other members supported another candidate, but Eastwood came to London to meet with them. The meeting was a disaster. Lennon, and of course Yoko (who as always sat in to give her opinions) apparently made numerous anti-semitic comments about Eastman (whose real name, coincidentally was Epstein). Needless to say, he didn\u2019t take them well. So I\u2019m guessing that Linda wasn\u2019t a fan of the man who insulted her father for no reason. ",

            "answer_text": "John Lennon probably made it extremely tough for Linda to like him with his criticism of Paul, as well as her father and brother (Lee and John Eastman). Whereas Paul seemed to carefully consider his public statements (at least most of the time), it seems as though John did not have much of a filter in terms of expressing his thoughts publicly. I think The best example of this is his 1970 Rolling Stone interview (where he seemed to attack everyone). But even in his later years, I thought John could be a bit flippant in some of his remarks regarding Paul. So, in answer to your question, in my opinion, I don\u2019t think Linda hated John. But she (and Paul) probably felt they needed to be on guard. ",

Read John Lennon\u2019s furious letter sent to Linda and Paul McCartney, 1971 Both couples moved on as both former Beatles (John and Paul) were concentrating on their respective solo careers afterwards, Linda learning to play keyboards for Paul\u2019s band (all while trying to juggle raising 2 of their eventual 4 children), etc..
