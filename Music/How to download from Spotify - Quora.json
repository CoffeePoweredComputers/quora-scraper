            "answer_text": "Hey, I am a big fan of Spotify. There are different kinds of songs in this easy-used streaming service. But there is something you need to know. If you are a free Spotify user, you cannot listen to music offline or download any songs from Spotify. If you are a premium subscriber, you are just allowed to download a limited number of songs in every device and even on up to 3 devices. Download Spotify Music on your desktop computer and mobile phoneThe first option is to pay for the Spotify premium. The price is $9.99 a month. You have a one-month free premium period to use. The plan is on its official site. You can choose the one that suits you. After getting a Spotify premium, just choose the songs or playlists you want to download. Then click the Download button. Finally, they are saved on your own device. Download Spotify Music by a third-party softwareBecause of DRM protection, you are not allowed to play Spotify songs on other apps. So without Spotify premium, you have to find a third-party app that helps you convert your songs from Spotify first and then play them offline without Spotify itself. Here I want to say something about a converter that I have used. It is called DumpMedia Spotify Music Converter. It supports many output formats like MP3, M4A, WAV, and FLAC. It is also free to have a try in 15 days. Windows and Mac version is available. I have tried both. It meets my requirement a lot. ",
