            "answer_text": "Honestly this is such a difficult question to answer, they are both the visual queens of Kpop to me personally. However I believe Irene is more classically pretty with her huge doe eyes and small jaw, there are practically no flaws in her face, she\u2019s gorgeous. Jennie, on the other hand, has a more unique face, kind of a walking juxtaposition. Sexy because of her beautiful cat eyes and long luscious hair, but cute because of her chubby cheeks and gummy smile. I\u2019d say in a contest, Irene would win since her beauty is more by the book, but Jennie may appeal to a larger audience because of the interest her face draws in. Personally I prefer Jennie\u2019s face, solely because of her sexy cat eyes, I\u2019d give anything to have eyes like that. However my current visual ranking of female Kpop idols goes like this: 3- Irene, 2- Jennie, and 1 actually goes Joy of Red Velvet! Love them all ",
