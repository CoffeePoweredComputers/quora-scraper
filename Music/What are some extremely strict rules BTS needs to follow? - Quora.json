            "answer_text": "even starting out, they didn\u2019t have many strict rules compared to other idols. I think this was the case because they originally weren\u2019t a generic kpop group, and their target audience was initially more guys than girls, so they didn\u2019t have a dating ban in their first contract (i\u2019m not sure if a dating ban will be implemented in the new contract). dieting was something encouraged, but not forced. Bighit was a small company, and BTS was very unpopular back then, so they were put on a year-long diet to lose weight. they followed this, but nowadays you\u2019ll catch some members eating whatever they want (like Jungkook, because he works out a lot and needs more food anyway, and Tae, who doesn\u2019t care much about his weight or diet. you\u2019ll notice that in the past year or so he gained a little bit of weight, he got quite fluffy and i alw uwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwu really hard seeing his fluffiness, and the others who have a fast metabolism. either way, they watch what they eat to avoid brutal comments on weight gain from the cruel knetz). if a member wishes to lose weight, they will choose to diet, and the staff will encourage it. after all, their message is to promote freedom of speech, so it would be very hypocritical for them to be controlled. the point is, they are very responsible and know what\u2019s best and what\u2019s not. they\u2019ll lose weight if they need to fit the standard, and they\u2019ll do what they need to to appeal to the public while maintaining their best selves.
