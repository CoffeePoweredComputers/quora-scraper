            "answer_text": "Most universities will require two years of coursework and if you\u2019re getting your degree in performance or composition, some number of recitals. After that, 6\u201312 months of prepping for your qualification exams. Once you\u2019ve jumped that hurdle, your dissertation will depend on how hard you work on it while you are doing other things (usually teaching, writing and/or performing). Once I passed my quals it took a few more years. It took a while because, like most of my classmates, I was busy teaching. You\u2019re looking at 3 years minimum but probably more like 5\u20138. ",
