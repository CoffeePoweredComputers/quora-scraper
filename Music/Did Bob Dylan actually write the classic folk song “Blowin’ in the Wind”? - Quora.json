            "answer_text": "\"Blowin' in the Wind\" is a song written by Bob Dylan in 1962 and released as a single and on his album The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan in 1963. An allegation that the song was written by a high-school student named Lorre Wyatt (a member of Millburn High School's \"Millburnaires\" all-male folk band) and subsequently purchased or plagiarized by Dylan before he gained fame was reported in an article in Newsweek magazine in November 1963. The plagiarism claim was eventually shown to be untrue. Fun Fact: Dylan originally wrote and performed a two-verse version of the song; its first public performance, at Gerde's Folk City on April 16, 1962, was recorded and circulated among Dylan fans. After this performance, Dylan added the middle verse. Some published versions of the lyrics reverse the order of the second and third verses, apparently because Dylan simply appended the middle verse to his original manuscript, rather than writing out a new copy with the verses in proper order. Question: Did Bob Dylan actually write the classic folk song \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind\u201d? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, he did. Lorre Wyatt was credited in a rumour while he was still a high school student. This Newsweek article kept up the rumour: \"There is even a rumor circulating that Dylan did not write \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind,\u201d that it was written by a Millburn (N.J.) High student named Lorre Wyatt, who sold it to the singer. Dylan says he did write the song and Wyatt denies authorship, but several Millburn students claim they heard the song from Wyatt before Dylan ever sang it. Dylan says he is writing a book that will explain everything. But, he insists, the explanations are irrelevant. \u201cI am my words,\u201d he says. Maybe this is enough. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot about Bobby I don\u2019t understand,\u201d says Joan Baez, who plays princess to his prince among young folk fans. \u201cBut I don\u2019t care. I understand his words. That\u2019s all that matters.\u201d Lorre wrote an article in Sing Out! magazine explaining that he did sing the song in a high school folk group and when folks started crediting him with writing it, he did not deny it, but when Dylan's song became well know, he confessed that it was not his song.Wyatt has gone on to write some fine songs and has co-written songs with his friend Pete Seeger.I think we should forgive him his youthful transgression.

You may be referring to the fact that the melody is an adaptation of the old spiritual \u201cNo More Auction Block\u201d, something Dylan has freely admitted for decades. Adaptation, however, is the key word, and melody aside, the lyrics are 100% Dylan's. \u201cBlowin' in the Wind\u201d is a Bob Dylan song. ",

(Which hasn't always been a 4 letter word.) With the advent of sound recording, and marketing, big money became the order of the day, and plagerization became a big-money court battle. John Fogerty was sued (unsuccessfully!) for plagerizing himself, simply because he'd \u201clost\u201d the publishing rights to his older work. ",
