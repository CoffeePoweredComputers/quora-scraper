            "answer_text": "Please don't hate on me,but this is how I feel if ATEEZ had debuted under Bighit, Verdict- Ruined And,if TXT's debuted under a different label may it be established or not so known, Verdict- Ruined as well Don't consider me as a BIGHIT hater quickly,first see why I said that, so First,I'm going to state the reason why I feel like that.First I speak on point of ATEEZ and TXT, ATEEZ Ateez is definitely in my opinion is a revelation.not just only bcoz of they came from a small company and became famous like a BIG3 rookie,it's because of how well planned and prepared are even before debut,I think I want to appreciate KQ for that,because they only selected only the people who had being carved well,even before debut.they gave ATEEZ a really good experience by making them travel around many places,look onto new ways in promoting music.Now,I come to the point,unlike TXT,Ateez are given much more creative control over their music by their label with hongjoong and mingi highly involved in lyrical composition,so ifthey had debuted under Bighit,they would've definitely would not have got that freedom over their music,since TXT is merely treated like how SM treat their artists,More foreign producers involved and only 0.01% involvement in production by members,this is the main problem,also Ateez have used untouched concepts in kpop like pirate concept,which is really interesting,For Me,Ateez concept is one of my 2 favourite after long time with Exo's being my first.Also,I think Ateez would've got got a even more major problem being BTS brother group,as everyone know how pressurised TXT are,it feels like knives are all hanging above them all the time,being pressurised to meet up with the expectations,also on other side BH is already making their very own nemesis for TXT on their own and that's I-land.i think they will debut at the end of the year or at the beginning of 2021,which means since they're already have a own debut bcoz being coming from a reality show,they also are under the view of two of currently Korea's biggest entertainment conglomerates and since they're also Bighit,i-land will automatically will grab the spotlight from TXT,which means an another pressure for them,so just think,if ATEEZ had debuted BH amid these things,I think they'll end up being completely ruined.Also,ATEEZ has Eden,their exec.producer.He is the main reason of ateez's success,he knows really well on how to use the boys talent,he clearly knows how to work up with them,though their rapline isn't great,he uses the rapline really well in their songs,their rap verses makes the song fluid,if ATEEZ had debuted under BH,they would've missed out on their game changing producer.Also,i think the household prod. Of Bighit may fail to use the boys properly like eden does. TOMORROWXTOGETHER If TXT had debuted under any company apart from BH,they would've endup ruined too,stating their success is supported by BTS's name and BH's clean image among public,so you can see their debut was rather record breaking but as days gone,for each CB,their presence in industry andcontribution is in the negative form,they failed to make it to monthly charts of May,because of tough competition with Eternity which is by far their best CB in my opinion and their numbers also gradually decreased when compared to debut but they're still steady.But if TXT had not being from BH,it will be difficult for them to reach success with their conceptualization.Their biggest minus is being promoted as an all round group,just we can see they're not super good in the main aspects for a artist like Vocals and Rapping except only their dance,which they're excellent at.since I have being a kpop fan since I was a child,so I have seen many terrifically talented vocalists throughout these years like chen and baekhyun from EXO,jonghyun from SHinee,Sanduel from B1A4,Eunkwang from Btob,yesung and kyuhyun from Super junior,Daesang from Bigbang,Lee hongi from FTisland who are considered amazing vocalists but I can't see any members from TXT,but taehyun and soobin stand out a lot but I can't tell them as they're at the level as these idols,though I consider them better than BTS in terms of VOCALS bcoz at this time,BH really concentrated on their vocals unlike they did to BTS,but TXT'S vocal when seen competition to even Ateez kinda loses to them,also rapping since they don't really write anything,I also don't consider them as rappers.So in my opinion promoting them as an all round group is like promoting an unbaked cake.Now come to the concepts,TXT'S concepts are either very relatable or over imaginary,especially in their last CB with CYSM,it's kinda outta limit imaginary and also quite disturbing,also BH is kinda confused with which they need to prioritize,their concept or their well received song,if you ask me Drama and Fairy of shampoo are just splendid but if you want to stick on to the storyline,you can't go with them,since CYSM and PUMA sets with the storyline,but if either Drama or FOS was selected as title,I bet TXT would've received much more attention than they got with CYSM and Puma. ,if they had debuted under other label,their label would've definitely struggled to choose which way to promote TXT as they can't be promoted neither as vocal group nor as a hiphop group,as don't meet up with both.even if you take BTS,even their vocals were by par,their rap is at top level but it isnt the same case with TXT,so they will also be ruined. So,In my opinion,Both Ateez and TXT are both in the places,they were supposed to be and also in the right way,but I think ATEEZ have a potential to outperform TXT,though They're successful than Ateez,TXT definitely have many problems coming from their company themselves,so I think TXT'S fate relies on how their future releases workout, if it hits right,TXT will become one of the biggest groups in kpop history,if it fails,TXT will become the biggest fail stories of all time.

            "answer_text": "TXT has always been compared to BTS, and the general consensus seems to be that they don\u2019t really live up to their seniors. Recently, with all the covers of BTS\u2019s songs, I\u2019ve seen the same thing happening with ATEEZ, but people seem to be more positive with the comparisons. Since TXT are promoted as an all rounder group, people tend to call them boring and they say that they only stand out because of Bighit and their creative team. ATEEZ on the other hand are often called monster rookies or get praised for their powerful stage presence and a huge international fanbase. I\u2019ve even seen some comments saying that they are going to be the \u201cnext BTS\u201d in terms of popularity. This just got me thinking about my questions and I wanted to see what other\u2019s opinions are. Here are my thoughts: I think that ATEEZ would be even bigger than they are now, obviously, having the Bighit company name to back them up. I don\u2019t know how big though, because with their current musical direction, they don\u2019t seem to be attracting many fans in Korea. Since I don\u2019t live there, I can\u2019t confirm that their music is more catered to Western audiences and that Koreans don\u2019t like their style, but some things do make it seem that way. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but their bigger concert venues have mostly been selling out internationally but the smaller ones in Korea still have many seats available. However, they do have great stage presence and a good group dynamic. Overall, I think that fans and the general public would think that they are more deserving of the title of BTS\u2019s juniors than TXT. *one of the main reasons people are saying \u201cATEEZ will be the next BTS\u201d is because they come from a small company, so if they did debut from a big company, maybe they would lose their \u201cunderdog\u201d aspect that would affect their overall appeal? that\u2019s a whole other question haha* Now, on to TXT. Personally, I think that they are all insanely talented don\u2019t deserve to be hated on or called boring just because people don\u2019t think they\u2019re as good as BTS. I don\u2019t have much to say for them except that I think they wouldn\u2019t be as popular as they are now. TXT debuting as BTS\u2019s juniors is sort of like a double edged sword. They gained a lot of attention but also a lot of hate. Without the pressure of this title, I think that they would be able to be a little bit more\u2026relaxed? I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the right word, but there\u2019s a lot of pressure on them right now and I think that without it, they could let their guard down a little and really let their personalities shine more. With that and their amazing music, I think that they would also be very successful, maybe just not as much as ATEEZ. To end off, although I wouldn\u2019t consider myself a MOA or an ATINY, I\u2019m a fan of both groups and their music, and this was not meant as hate towards either of the groups. I wish them the best for their careers and this was just a hypothetical scenario I thought would be fun to think about. :) ",
