            "answer_text": "That\u2019s actually a great question. In films, you have a Music Supervisor and then a Film Composer. The composer, e.g. Hans Zimmer, Danny Elfman, etc., compose the background instrumental music that helps engage with the mood of the story and helps it move forward. It\u2019s like another actor in the movie. The Music Supervisor will work with the Director and/or Producer to come up with songs that they would like to have on the soundtrack that will be used primarily in the opening and closing credits and depending on what type of movie, you will have several songs played in the background as well. Many of the teen movies throughout the 80\u2019s were loaded with popular songs or songs that became popular once they were heard in the movie. e.g. Fast Times At Ridgemont High. The Music Supervisor also has the job of working the deals with the artists and bands to get their music into the movie. Often times a huge band will get asked to contribute a song for a movie and they will want too much money or points on the back end and the movie studio is not willing to give it to them. So they will go out and find a lesser known band, though talented, and find a song that is right for their movie. But not all huge bands play \u201chardball\u201d with their songs. If you saw \u201cReady Player One\u201d, you will notice that the movie opens with \u201cJump\u201d by Van Halen and ends with \u201cYou Make My Dreams\u201d by Hall and Oats. (double check for me on the Hall and Oats song). The Music Supervisor had to work with both artists to get their songs on the soundtrack. That includes negotiating all of the money. So with all of my babbling, the answer to your question is that the Music Supervisor along with the Director and Producers gather the bands for the soundtracks. And that is how they\u2019re put together. And here\u2019s the classic soundtrack to \u201cFast Times At Ridgemont High\u201d. Not every song, but most: Fast Times Soundtrack - YouTube ",
