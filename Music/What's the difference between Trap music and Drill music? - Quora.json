            "answer_text": "A few things come to mind\u2026 To begin your 808 choice between trap and drill will be very different. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re wondering about \u201cAmerican Drill\u201d so here is 3 most important features in both to me. 808 (drill) Your 808 of choice will be a spinz. An 808 which is easily EQ\u2019ed to become a slide. A slide is the part of the 808 pattern that is a much higher octave than your base 808(usually at the end of your 4 or 8 bar) 808 (trap) In the modern trap sound the 808 used derived from the original zaytoven 808 has been altered to hit faster and be punchier. Hi hat pattern (drill) off the top of my head I know it\u2019s (this is 4bars) 1st / 3rd / 5th / 5.5 /7 it\u2019s a little off beat at first but with a clap or snare it makes more sense Hi Hat pattern trap Could be a 1 bar could be a half bar really doesn\u2019t matter with trap you can do rolls and all that but it\u2019s more on beat compared to drill Clap Drill The clap will be on your 2nd bar and then on your 6th bar that\u2019s what is the most distinct feature of drill to me besides the off beat hi hat pattern. The way you have to wait for the 2nd clap really gives the bounce. Clap Trap Will have a basic 2nd and 4th bar placement. Also! Here is 2 great drum kits to get you started!

            "answer_text": "Well, to be honest I haven\u2019t listened to very many \u2018Drill\u2019 songs, but from what I\u2019ve heard it seems to be objectively lamer XD.That may just be a taste thing, I don\u2019t know, but I do know that everyone has their preferences. However, when it comes to Trap music I have definitely heard my fair share of it. Anyways, Trap beats tend to have very strong similarities like thick basses, the sound of a hat on every 8th beat with some possible variation; the list goes on. There\u2019s a video of an awesome musician that gives tutorials on how to make music. While he\u2019s made one on trap, he hasn\u2019t made one on Drill- regardless, he breaks Trap down to a nice, malleable jam. His name\u2019s Frankjavcee, and for fair warning he curses. But if since you\u2019re asking this question, I don\u2019t really feel like that\u2019ll be an issue. :)How to make Trap Music ",
