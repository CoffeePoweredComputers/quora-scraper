            "answer_text": "Definitely not. Their songs. Blackpink does have several bops, I admit, but they do not have the variety BTS does. Many people can argue against this and say that they have only been debuted for three years, but when BTS had debuted for the same amount of time Blackpink has, which is three years, BTS had almost 50 songs by the end of 2015, while Blackpink is still stuck at around twelve. Blackpink also does not have the meaning and thoughtfulness BTS puts in their songs. While most Blackpink songs are about themselves, BTS makes their songs about how you should value themselves, how you should love yourselves, and also tackles problems in society, and education.Efforts. BTS definitely surpasses Blackpink on this one. BTS has been working hard since the beginning, and has not stopped now. They continue to work hard, and the reason I say this is because in the very beginning, they literally came from a company of nothing, while Blackpink already came from a successful company. YG was one of the Big Three, and now BigHit is climbing the charts because of BTS\u2019s hard work and perseverance. I will not even mention the Jennie thing.Vocals. Blackpink is talented sure, Rose has a sweet voice. Jisoo is stable, and Jennie can rap okay. But they do not compare to BTS. Sure BTS has made mistakes in their lifetime, like voice cracks. But, they still give their all in performances. They struggled in the beginning and struggled more than a lot of K-POP groups, yet they manage to make every performance amazing. When I listen to the MR removed videos, I see Blackpink with wobbly vocals, not stable at all, and letting the backtrack sing over half of it. I compare that to BTS\u2019S MR removed videos, and I find that BTS is almost always stable, does not let the backtrack sing for them, and they ace the choreography.Choreography. Blackpink is also okay on this one, with Lisa. Lisa is an amazing dancer, with charisma, beautiful body movements, but overall, as a group, the choreography is not as eye catching as k-pop choreography should be. Blackpink\u2019s choreography has repeated themselves in several songs, making it more boring. That shouldn\u2019t even be a problem, considering that they only have a handful of songs. While BTS has so many songs, yet each of their choreography is different.Content. Blackpink do not provide as many content as BTS do. BTS releases so many music in just half a year. In 2019, BTS made a comeback with seven songs, and they released all three songs to the new game BTS World, and are about to come out with a Japanese original called Lights, and a Japanese version of Boy With Luv. They also upload a Run Episode every Tuesday, does events such as Festa, Muster, and the stadium tour. Blackpink is hardly even seen doing fan signings. BTS also keeps their music interesting, making theories and stories to keep fans attracted.Impact. As you can tell BTS has already made a huge impact in the world. They donate thousands of dollars to charities and foundations, and they support campaigns such as the Love Yourself Campaign, and they speak up for the LGBTQ community, and mental health. They also contribute to four billion dollars to Korea. So, in this category so far, BTS surpasses Blackpink.Given these reasons, I think that Blackpink can not beat BTS. Edit: I deleted that bit about boy group choreography being better than girl group choreography as it was something that wasn\u2019t true. Thanks to everyone who mentioned that! ",

            "answer_text": "BTS  Blackpink  Do we really need to explain? Am I being biased? Ahaha. They had four years and still have not reached a Million sales? Iz*One is two years younger and they have already outsold them by doubling their sales. BP do have bops but in my opinion their songs lacks variety (concept, lyrics, choreography). Well, they lack songs in general, they have had how many comebacks in Four years? They win few times but just as quickly drops from charts. Their CONCEPTS are REPETITIVE. DANCE routines are RECYCLED. LYRICS are REPETITIVE, RECYCLED, NONSENSICAL at times and just an OVERALL \u2018Meh\u2019 . And to only have that much sales and claim to be at par with or able to beat BTS. RECORD BREAKING? YT is practically the only platform they beat BTS in every now and then. Not because they have more fans but I think most of those are not actual Blinks but are only watching out of curiosity (? Or other reasons) like me. I do watch their mv, once just to see if it worth the hype, but that's it I'm not gonna say I'm an actual fan. They do have quite a number of very passionate following (who defend them just as passionately, vulgarly, and violent at times, I've had first hand experience with them and boi are they crazy) but still not at par to beat BTS. Let's be honest, YT doesn't guard them as much and delete their views cause well their relevance is also not at par. When we all know that they mass stream the way ARMY do but since BTS is RELEVANT we are watched like a hawk. They also rent whole ass computer shops for DAYS to \u201cbreak\u201d records. But are their views deleted as much. NO. WHY? EXACTLY!!!! If mf YT doesn't delete ARMYs hard earned views, blinks wouldn't even stand a chance. Organic my ass. AWARDS? They get a few small awards here and there but that's it. DAESANG? As far as I'm aware they have been around for 4 years yet have NOT WON A SINGLE ONE considering how people hype them and say they are \u201cat par\" or \u201ccan beat\" BTS. Well. Enough of that. This is all my opinion anyways. And I don't really follow BP much to know everything about them. ALSO just my opinion but they seem to be MORE of INFLUENCERS than idols/singers/performers. ADDT'L:: I finally found words to express it\u2026 Most/Alot of people find their songs catchy and listen/watch on YT or Spotify, Itunes etc\u2026 but only upto that point. They like the title songs and listen a lot (unintentionally streaming) but don't find it necessary or don't care enough to give a sh*t to buy an actual album or listen to b-sides. They're only there for the bop but are not really there to stan and support. Hence the meager sales. Their latest 'single' took more than a year and not even an album and I can't even rant about how disappointed I'am with the song\u2026. lyrically, musically, concept wise, dance routine, MV (even without the controversy)\u2026 basically everything\u2026. it would take too long. BTW, I disabled the comments because some blinks are just so *sigh's in Gucci* anyways, they couldn't accept the fact that a telltale indication of an artist's success is in fact SALES. Whether it be album, merch, endorsements, tickets for fanmeets and STADIUM TOURS etc. Even the stuff they use and wear\u2026 oh hellow there Downy and toothbrush\u2026 they even bring back to life dying businesses and industry. Oh right, BP can't relate since they couldn't even sell out a local fanmeet with a 2k+ arena capacity despite tickets being sold for over a month. While, around the same time, our boys sold out 30k to 55k seats for a two day fanmeets in japan gathering 170k attendees (korean fanmmet excluded). Blinks sell out stuff they use and wear but do these \u201cfans\u201d find it necessary to buy the girls\u2019 albums? Haha. Nope. It's not as if they can wear the albums right? So if you wanted to comment and add things I'm sorry. I'm a very sensitive little bean so I really don't want to read the things they say. Just upvote if you will. Heheh. Thanks. So yeah I contemplated on opening the comments just cuz I wanted to see how desperate people can get \u2661(> \u0a0a <)\u2661 ",

Thats what first of all makes boy groups more popular than girl groups. 2 Bts is more privileged. You can't even disagree, Yg literally is the worst. He barely gives them any comebacks, Blackpink can't write their own songs, Yg uses them for money. Blackpink wasn't even supposed to debut. Yg entertainment is harsher than Bighit. If Blackpink got the chance to right their own songs and get more comebacks like Bts, they would be wayy more popular than they are. 3. Bts are a group of seven, where blackpink is a group of 4. Obviously if there are more people, their are more ideas and better ideas. 4 bts have been in the industry for 7 years where blackpink have been only for 4 years. Bts has more been in the industry longer meaning more people know them and they have more experience. 5 Most of Bts members are older than blackpink which mean they are more mature. 6 If blackpink were given better and different choreography, they would have been more popular and have been improved more which means they could improve and do harder stuff. 7 If blackpink had stuff like Weverse, Bangtan Tv, Bts bomb etc, more people would watch them and they would have been more popular. Overall, my point is, if they were as privileged as Bts, yes they could have been popular than bts. ",

            "answer_text": "To be honest why not, if BLACKPINK just makes songs which have more meaning they could get recognitions from organisations like U.N they already have collared with Samsung in the Samsung event in Bangkok which caught the eye of several south East Asian news outlets and news media\u2019s and so on. Sure they might not be as talented or experienced as BTS but they are breaking records fast. BLACKPINKS music videos have held the titles of most viewed videos in 24hrs like in Ddu-du-ddu-du and Kill this love they beat artists like Ariana Grande, Taylor swift and Justin Bieber. Plus they are a huge Cash cow for YG making 66 million dollars a year and growing but that isn\u2019t as much as BTS\u2019s 75 million dollars but that\u2019s a lot if you consider it\u2019s been 6 years since BTS debut and it\u2019s been 3 years since BLACKPINK debut in fact they are the first female group since 2008 to make a million dollars from a single concert in North America! In fact they won a shorty award for best in music! Sure they aren\u2019t as talented or experienced as BTS but if they go on more talk shows and Youtube channels like Buzzfeed and even do collaborations with youtubers like Superwoman or Liza koshy or make more songs with meaning you better best believe that there\u2019s a new Kpop group on top that\u2019s BLACKPINK ",

            "answer_text": "I get this question about 20x a week. My thoughts may not be on the popular side of the fence. Have seen the YouTuber who does the sub counts using BTS & Blackpink. Also know that it is said both band fans do not like each other. I see it in very simple terms much like an apple and orange both fruits Yes. Do they taste the same No. Some people like both others prefer one or the other. While some simply do not like the taste of either one at all. I like a few Blackpink songs but I love BTS songs. Well most of them. Plus am a Boy Band Fan Girl. Personal Preference. This summer went to see both bands play, mostly my best friend loves Blackpink I sacrifice for my family and friends. Can Blackpink Beat BTS in what CATEGORY? IDOL earns BTS the record for most viewed music video online in 24 hour BTS continues to break records, will Blackpink do the same so far according to the Data No. They are the same being Kpop, however different being male & female also musical taste is different. That doesn\u2019t mean BP isn\u2019t going to beat them in the future as the men will be going into the military soon. Better end it here as I can write a novel based on Data alone. credit to article from Gueniss World Record: IDOL earns BTS the record for most viewed music video online in 24 hours Ku, Meili Kpop Hit Tv ",

            "answer_text": "No one can beat anyone. No group deserves to be compared to others. BTS themselves said that they are partners of their company. They discuss things with their company. They talk about concepts, clothes, contents, music, lyrics, etc. They\u2019re included in the producing process of each comeback, each concert, etc. Their individual opinions matter. Their company has trusted in their abilities enough to give them the freedom that other artists from other companies do not have. That gave them the ability to grow and mature as artists and later on became game changers of the industry. Whereas in Blackpink\u2019s side, their company just sees them as any other girl group who needs to look good to earn money. They weren\u2019t been able to produce their own music as much as they want to. I\u2019m sure they are hardworking people with talents and skills. But the way their company handled them, it is obvious that they were not allowed to grow more than what the company can handle. Blackpink is different from BTS. Blackpink is Blackpink no one can ever be the same as them and whatever success they have, it\u2019s theirs. The same with BTS. There will always be one BTS and no one can beat or surpass them because no one can ever be BTS. Every group will experience a unique path of their own. Why are some of the answers here even comparing their efforts? How do you know exactly that BTS puts in more effort than any other group?? Everyone in the industry puts all their best into everything they do. All these idols spent years and years of training just to be able to reach their goals, spent sleepless nights just to hone their performances. And you got the audacity to say one is more hardworking than the other? Y\u2019all are unbelievable. I hope you put it in your mind every time you downplay someone\u2019s effort, hard work, and talent just because you don\u2019t want to see it. All these groups, all these artists have been doing all their best. They deserve RESPECT. We just have different tastes but that doesn\u2019t mean your idol is better than mine and vice versa. If what\u2019s gonna come out of your mouth is some toxic bs, please just shut up. ",

Anyway\u2026 BlackPink can\u2019t \u201cbeat\u201d BTS for some major reasons that all the people who compare BP with BTS should know: BTS since the beginning had only one purpose: To share their universal message and to learn us to Love Ourself and they made this through their songs. They talk about daily problems like anxiety, mental problems, self hate etc, who everyone has probably suffered once and BTS is there to bring this people together and in a way to help them all as much as possible. There are numerous people who were helped by BTS and their music and now they see the bright the side of things and feel better thanks to them. While BlackPink (even though I don\u2019t wanna say this) doesn\u2019t have any kind of message. On their songs they only talk about how they are good at everything they do and this isn\u2019t sth that really gives any kind of message. BP right now might be famous on different magazines or channels but that\u2019s not the right fame. Important is for what you are recognized and not how much. Blinks can hate me for this but this is the true. Ps. This answer was inspired by another ARMY but since I had the chance I wanted to share it. :)) ",

Blackpink on the other hand\u2026 not bad but definitely not good enough to beat Bts. 2- Not enough songs. I think that this is a big problem. Even though blackpink debuted like four years ago they have very few songs 3- Meaning in songs. Let's be real. Blackpink songs don't have any meaning. Yes, they are catchy but they get old too quickly. Meanwhile Bts has very good meaning to their songs and they never get old. Really I still listen to their debut song. 4- Vocals. Yes, Rose and Jennie have good vocals. Jisoo is also ok. But\u2026. Lisa? I mean it's not that bad but really needs some work. In bts even Jin (who didn't sing or dance before bts) has very good vocals. 5- Blackpink came from Yg. One of the big three. Thats why it was easier for them to become populer then Bts who was from a company that no ona heard. 6- Unlike Blackpink Bts write their own lyrics. I think that it's a big problem that Yg doesn't let Blackpink members write their own lyrics So I think that if Blackpink work harder they can get better, but they never will beat Bts because Bts works veeeeeeryyy hard \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c ",

            "answer_text": "Welp when it comes to views and subcribers or everything on social medias blackpink can beat bts, some fans only likes blackpink because of their popularity and their music concepts. But when it comes to album sales, digital song sales, charts and awards, nope blackpink can't beat bts. Why? Because army's only cares about the albums and the songs. Army's are great on voting, buying and streaming. They're great. Army's are literally the biggest kpop fandom. Blinks ranked 2 on the biggest kpop fandom but why can't they buy blackpink's mini album though? Because it's only a mini album? That's not a reason. Blinks should focus more on buying blackpink's album than only streaming their mv's so that blackpink might win daesangs. Blackpink is a great kpop girl group their music concepts is cool but the lyrics of their every songs is not that inspirational or have meanings. BTS is the only kpop group who helps others in way at their music with meaning and inspirational lyrics. Bts is on higher level than blackpink, yes Blackpink might surpassed bts on views but not on other platforms. :) -this is my opinion. ",

            "answer_text": "They can if they try\u2026\u2026 1.Blackpink gets a little more views on some of their M/Vs than BTS because the whole set is very beautiful and attractive. And are also popular enough that they can rise more higher. BLACKPINK's video has been watched a massive 625 million times, beating BTS who have been watched 623 million times. Many will say that they have more views because their fans don\u2019t have anything else to see since Blackpink doesn\u2019t have more comebacks. But everybody gets bored if they hear to one song, nobody can hear to one song for a year, so there must be something in Blackpink that make no one ever get bored to their songs for a year and more. 2. Because of BTS army. As an A.R.M.Y. I know not all A.R.M.Y.s are like this but most of them are like this. They are a boys, they mostly have girl fans who mostly like them not because of the music but their looks(not all). And girls mostly get addicted to boys which is one reason why boy groups have more sasaengs and girls rarely have sasaengs. And if any of the boys have dating rumors the fans start blaming the idol. This is a bitter truth not only applicable on BTS but on all k-pop boy groups. 3. For e.g. : When Taehyung was caught in dating rumors a majority of fans heated up on him, similarly when Jungkook got his tattoos many armys got angry and his popuarity decreased. 4. And even though Blackpink are the third most popular kpop group after BTS and Exo, they have a lot of connection outside which are very important in a career like this. And Exo will never get on the Billboard charts because of several reasons. So, Blackpink has more chance to be second. 5. And Blackpink is still very popular since they debuted in 2016. Blackpink became famous because\u2026\u2026.yes BTS did let the world know about kpop, but the whole worl even knows about Twice then why aren\u2019t they popular. Blackpink worked hard for where they are now. So ya if they keep doing hardwork then they might be able to overcome bts one day. So, BLACKPINK have a chance to beat BTS. EDIT : Okay\u2026..So this whole answer is just my point of of view. ARMYs think that BTS is the best and BLINKS think that BLACKPINK is the best and ONCEs thinks that TWICE is the best\u2026\u2026\u2026 SO , IN CONCLUSION I WOULD SAY THAT EVERY FANDOM THINKS THAT THEIR IDOLS ARE THE BEST AND THEIR IS NO PROBLEM IN THAT. BUT WHAT IS WRONG IS WHEN FANDOMS WANT OTHERS FANDOMS TO ALSO ACCEPT THAT THEIR FANDOM IS THE BEST. THIS APPLIES TO EVERY FANDOM NOT ONLY ARMY OR BLINK. THIS LIFE IS VERY SMALL TO KEEP HATING ON SOMEONE SO BE WITH YOUR LOVED ONES AND THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE AND LET EVERYONE LIVE THEIR LIVES WITH THEIR LOVED ONES. I KNOW THIS ANSWER DOESN\u2019T CHANGE EVERYBODY\u2019S PERSPECTIVE BUT ONCE JUST THINK WHAT ARE YOU GETTING BY HATING ON IDOLS. ARE THEY GOING TO DISBAND. WILL BLACKPINK DISBAND IF PEOPLE SAY \u201cTHEY ARE SLUTS, TALENTLESS AND THEY SHOULD DIE\u201d ? NO. WILL BTS DISBAND IF YOU PEOPLE SAY THEY ARE \u201cGAY, THEY SHOULD DIE\u201d? NO. THIS WILL ONLY HURT THEM AND NOT GIVE YOU ANYTHING. AND IF YOU WANNA HURT THEM\u2026..THEN YOU ARE PSYCHO AND YOU SHOULD PROBABLY VISIT A MENTAL HOSPITAL. PEOPLE CAN SAY I\u2019M BEING RUDE BUT I DON\u2019T CARE ANYMORE. PEOPLE WHO WANT TO HATE WILL HATE AND PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LEAVE WILL LEAVE BUT PEOPLE WHO LOVED YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF THEIR HEART WILL NEVER LET YOU GO AND WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU TILL THE END. IF YOU WANT TO IGNORE THIS THEN IGNORE BUT PLEASE ONCE READ IT AGAIN AND THINK ABOUT IT FOR A WHILE AND THEN LEAVE A COMMENT TO HATE ON THIS ANSWER. I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE BUT DON\u2019T NEED TO TELL ME WHY YOU FEEL THIS ANSWER IS WRONG BECAUSE YOU ARE WASTING MY TIME AND YOURS. MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMENTS ARE TRYING TO TELL ME THAT HOW THEY FEEL MY ANSWER IS WRONG IN SUCH LONG PARAGRAPHS AND I READ THEIR COMMENTS TO MAKE SURE IF I WROTE SOMETHING OFFENSIVE TO THE ARTISTS OR THE FANDOM BUT IT IS ALWAYS THE SAME THING. THIS IS NOT MEANT TO BASH ANYONE BUT PLEASE STOP ACTING IMMATURE HERE AND THINK BEFORE COMMENTING. JUST SAY YOU DISAGREE, I MEAN WHY DO YOU HAVE TO WRITE SUCH A BIG ANSWER. AND STOP FANWARS YOU ARE JUST CREATING A BAD IMAGE FOR THE GROUP. STOP HATING ON THE COMPANY AND SAYING THAT THEY ARE MISTREATING THE IDOLS, GET TO KNOW THE MEANING OF MISTREATMENT FIRST. AND IF YOU ARE A SOLO STAN NEVER CALL YOURSELF A BLINK, ARMY, ONCE OR ANY OTHER FANDOM. IF YOU WANT TO BE IN A FANDOM THAN LOVE EVERYONE AND NOT ONLY ONE PERSON OF THE GROUP. THE IDOLS ARE SO GOOD FRIENDS LIKE BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND THE LAST THING THEY WANT TO SEE ARE THEIR FANDOMS FIGHTING WITH EACH OTHER. I SORRY FOR SOUNDING RUDE. HOPEFULLY THE FANDOMS CAN BE TOGETHER AS FRIENDS HOW THEIR IDOLS ARE. :) ",

They all give you a different feeling- Blackpink, on the other hand, has multiple songs that give the same feeling and mood. They sound the same. Of course, they're music is good! They're all decent songs with nice beats, but they're not different. Blackpinks dances are mediocre. DDU-DU-DDU-DU has a good dance, but they released Kill This Love after claiming the dance was going to be extremely difficult. The dance moves are all the same in most songs. BTS has dances like Idol, Spring day, Baepsae, and they're all different. Another minus for blackpink is the fact that Jenni has a past of being lazy and not participating correctly. All in all, I believe BTS could beat Blackpink. ",

They are hitting milestones and markets no other Kpop artists has achieved. I wish you guys would stop this who is better stuff between BTS and Blackpink or EXO and all the other KPOP groups. Maybe they can maybe they can\u2019t. Blackpink comes from one of the big 3 and have a huge fanbase in most of Asia. That\u2019s to their advantage. Go support your favorite artists and help them achieve greatness. Everyone should be estactic that one of their own is breaking down doors to help them reach a bigger audience. ",

They have a message, variety in music, open hearts to groups such as LGBT, they\u2019re choreography and vocals are impeccable, and they\u2019re very humble. BlackPink are talented of course. However they\u2019re choreography is simple and not as complex, they\u2019re stage presence isn\u2019t the best and their songs are all very similar. Due to YG stepping down, I do not know what\u2019s in store for the girls, hopefully more opportunities. But as of right now, no I don\u2019t think they can surpass BTS\u2019 success. It\u2019s quite possible that no kpop group can, BTS are og and everyone will remember that forever. ",

As of how things are right now\u2026 no. Blackpink suffers from a lack of content, a disjointed fandom, and an excess of hate. BTS on the other hand has a lot of content and has a pretty unified fandom (although it can be a little toxic sometimes). In terms of all around talent BTS takes the cake but since improvement you know, exists Blackpink could someday surpass them. Maybe when BTS starts to enlist in the military Blackpink could fill the hole that they will leave but I seriously doubt it. In the end you can\u2019t really compare the two seeing as when Blackpink was just debuting BTS was pretty big. ",

If you are asking this question then I will automatically assume you are afraid of BlackPink\u2019s power. To answer your question, there is nothing to beat. BlackPink songs are different and BTS songs are different. Their concepts aren\u2019t the same. Also sometimes people want to listen to female singers while other times male. Comparing them is quite disrespectful and stupid. If you are trying to seek validation and hate on BlackPink then you are a toxic person. I hope that isn\u2019t the case and that you are genuinely just curious. ",

BTS gets much more money than Blackpink, and right now Blackpink\u2019s agency is nearly falling apart, so they are not steady. Blackpink is very famous, but BTS is almost a impossible group to beat.
