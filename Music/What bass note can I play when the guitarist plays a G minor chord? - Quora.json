            "answer_text": "This depends on what sound you want to achieve with your bass note. A good place to start would be by also playing one of the notes from a G minor chord. These are G, Bb and D. The G (root note) will sound very strong, steady and stable. This is because the G is where the chord starts from (so to speak) and having the bass play the root note is often considered the most stable sound. The Bb (minor 3rd) will place the chord in first inversion. I always feel that this is less stable but also quite exciting as a sound as, to my ear, it sounds like the chord has to move. I always feel it has a rising quality to it. It\u2019s quite soft and subtle as a sound. You can also you the note of D (2nd inversion) which is very suspenseful in my opinion. It can sound quite grand but used in the right place it\u2019s can make a very cool effect. There are other options to use which are notes outside of the G minor chord but if you\u2019re just starting out or if you\u2019re new to music theory I would suggest getting to know the notes of each chord before you look at bass notes which will imply suspensions and tensions in a chord. I hope this has helped! www.onlinebassguitar.com ",

            "answer_text": "Assuming a G minor chord is what is wanted\u2026 Start with a G on the first beat of the new chord. Just about any note can follow that G, but keep in mind these points (for a tonal feel): If you are on a G, Bb, or D, you can keep that note or keep moving by step or by leap. If you are on one of the other implied scale degrees of G minor, keep moving by step until you get to a G, Bb, or D. If you are on a chromatic note (a semitone away from a chord tone or scale tone), keep moving by semitone to get to a scale tone or chord tone, then treat that note accordingly. These instructions work on any chord; just substitute the name and spelling of the chord you are using. The rhythm you use depends on the style you are playing, but generally it doesn\u2019t change anything with regards to choice of note. ",
