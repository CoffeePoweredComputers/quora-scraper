            "answer_text": "Here is my updated list: If a song has a ? it means it has a solid hook but the verses aren\u2019t great. The Marshall Mathers LP- This album is almost universally considered to be Eminem\u2019s best, with some great production by Eminem, Dr Dre and Mel-Man. Every single track on this album is great, and at the same time it feels so effortless. There is a central theme- examining Eminem\u2019s rise to fame, however there are songs for pretty much every mood. Horror-core tracks on it are some of Eminem\u2019s best, even if they aren\u2019t singles. Highlights (honestly just listen to the whole album): I\u2019m Back, Under the Influence?, Stan, Kill You?, The Real Slim Shady, The Way I Am, Criminal.The Eminem Show- An album containing tracks which flow really well, however this is when drug addiction was just starting to affect some music Eminem was putting out, and it shows on tracks like Drips. Soldier isn\u2019t great either but I find it cool to listen to while playing CS:GO. Highlights: Without Me, Business, White America, Square Dance?, Hailey\u2019s Song, Cleanin Out My Closet, Till I Collapse.The Slim Shady LP- This is what started it all, Eminem goes back to this album often and many themes and ideas from it are continued. With some great production by Dr Dre and Mel-Man, Eminem was really able to show the world what he could do as a lyricist. This album is very violent and graphic in general, but it makes for an entertaining listen. Highlights: My Name Is, Still Don\u2019t Give a Fuck?, Role Model, Guilty Conscience.The Marshall Mathers LP 2- the best album since the Eminem Show and perhaps even the Marshall Mathers LP, Eminem really demonstrated that he has not fallen off, and that he is still capable of producing some classics. If it wasn\u2019t for this album I would honestly be concerned about whether or not Shady still has it. One of his most technical albums, he focuses on the verses almost entirely, and while some run a little long he is able to get a lot off his chest in 6 minutes. Highlights: Rap God, Brainless, So Far, Love Game, Berzerk, The Monster.Encore- this album is much less dark and considerably sadder than the rest of Eminem\u2019s discography, likely due to his spiraling addiction and the effect his fame was having on him and his daughter. Some tracks are downright terrible (he was probably high recording these) while others are touching, if a little depressing for my taste. Highlights: Mockingbird, Like Toy Soldiers, Never Enough, Yellow Brick Road? Just Lose It??Revival- Eminem\u2019s most recent work was a major disappointment, both after the Marshall Mathers LP 2 and the fact it was his first in 4 years. There are some decent tracks, but others are completely unlistenable. The wordplay is probably Eminem\u2019s best ever, however there are so many corny jokes and puns, not to mention the downright horrific production. The delivery is one of the strongpoints- he cuts the bullshit and forgoes accents for once which is nice. The album just fails to maintain a common theme across 20 tracks, in an attempt to make a song for everybody Eminem has made an album for nobody. Highlights: Offended, River, Walk on Water, Castle, Arose, Untouchable? Framed??Recovery- a marked improvement over Relapse, and with a more technical approach (seems Slim Shady died with Relapse) however just like the former the delivery lets it down, with an overly harsh tone. Eminem doesn\u2019t need to scream the whole album at the top of his lungs to express his anger. Also the album is so full of curse words it takes the meaning out of them, and makes his attempt to be a \u201ctough guy\u201d somewhat cringeworthy, after he said 3 times earlier he doesn\u2019t give a fuck. Highlights: Not Afraid???, Cold Wind Blows??, Love the Way You Lie??, Space Bound, Talkin To Myself.Relapse- terrible, especially for an Eminem album. Not used to writing and recording while not high, Eminem makes a complete fool of himself. The anger from earlier is gone completely, replaced with accents which make the listener question whether they are actually listening to Eminem, the guy who wrote Lose Yourself, My Name Is, Stan, ect. Highlights: We Made You????, Forever???, Crack A Bottle?????Infinite- not much to say, this was before Eminem broke out and it is much shorter than the others. It has bits of the Eminem we know and love, but the poor production and limited appeal to those outside Detroit are what doomed this record.",

            "answer_text": "The answer to this question depends greatly on individual. It is highly subjective. Moreover I'm just including his studio albums (not compilations or movie songs)1 THE MARSHALL MATHERS LP :- The album sold more than 1.76 million copies in the US in the first week alone, becoming the fastest-selling studio album by any solo artist in American music history. In 2001, the album won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album and was nominated for Album of the Year. With songs like Stan, The real slim shady, the way I am, kim, criminal and Kill you- this is eminem's most classic and creative album with all the emotions.2 THE EMINEM SHOW :- . It was the best-selling album of 2002 in the United States, with 7.6 million copies sold. At the 2003 Grammy Awards it was nominated for Album of the Year and became Eminem's third LP in four years to win the award for Best Rap Album. On March 7, 2011, the album was certified ten-times-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.Songs like without me, cleanin' out my closet, superman, sing for the moment and business will make you spellbound. The diversity of content in TES and great lyrics makes it the so good.3 THE SLIM SHADY LP - went on to be certified quadruple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The record won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, and in 2012, the album was ranked number 275 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.The songs  My Name Is, Guilty Conscience, '97 Bonnie & Clyde,Just Don't Give a Fuck and Role Model are beyond words and express real emotions.4 RECOVERY -Recovery had earned Eminem American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, Detroit Music Awards and Grammy Awards. It was also nominated for Brit Awards, Juno Awards and MTV Video Music Awards Japan. Recovery went on to become the best selling album of 2010 Worldwide and in the US with sales of 5.7 million worldwide and 3.4 million in the US. At the 2011 Grammys It was nominated for Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Record of the Year for the Album and the international chart topping single Love The Way You Lie.Not Afraid, Love the Way You Lie, No Love, Space Bound, Won't Back Down, going through changes are the best songs. This is his most mature album. From lyrics to composition to content, this album really shows how far Em has come as an artist and as a person. This is by far, his most transparent work. Even the cover art depicts a totally different Eminem from his other albums.5. THE MARSHALL MATHERS LP 2 - It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and had the second highest album sales of 2013. To date, the album has sold 2,700,000 copies in the United States according to Nielsen Soundscan and 5,500,000 copies worldwide. The album won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 57th Grammy Awards.Berzerk, Survival, Rap God, The Monster, Headlights, Legacy and Bad Guy are the best songs and display the new more mature and technically and lyrically strong eminem. But then again this is my opinion. Moreover, you can pick Eminem's worst albums and it'll still be better than many rapper's careers! This is his greatness; this is his legacy. He is rap god for a reason :) ",
