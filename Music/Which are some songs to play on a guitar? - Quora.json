            "answer_text": "Most of the answerers so far have suggested easy songs. But the question asks for great songs to play. And that's an entirely different question than \"what are some easy songs to play?\" Foxy Lady is a great song to play, if--you can play it well. Incidentally, this is the case with most songs. If you can play them great, they will be great. If you can't play very well, no songs are going to be great for you to play. You'll have to work at them,  to make them great *for you*. So you always want to pick something that you like, so you're more likely to spend time working at it, and also because you will have more respect for the music you like and as a result you will aspire to a higher standard when playing it. And there's no limit to what you can play. Plenty of songs without guitar on the recorded version can sound great when played on the guitar. As far as how to get great at playing, the most important thing to focus on--if you want to be great--is the rhythm. Obviously, it's important to play some good notes as well. But the rhythm is what really moves people. Being able to coordinate playing the changes while keeping a nice dancin' groove is what makes any song great. There are a lot of awesome, groovy records out there and you can always turn on a recording and play along with it, making sure you stay in the groove with the record. That's a great way to train yourself to listen while you are playing, which is key to developing rhythm. Being great at anything takes years of focused effort, and guitar is no different. Most of the greatest songs to play may be out of reach in the beginning. But don't lose faith. Be proactive. Find something that you can play, that you like. Focus on being great at that. Do that over and over, until you develop a repertoire, and it becomes easy to learn new songs.  This answer has focused on how to make any song great to play, by being a great player. But since you asked for specific songs, here is a small list of a few songs that I regard to be great songs to play on guitar: I Got You (I Feel Good) - James Brown Sir Duke - Stevie Wonder What's Going On - Marvin Gaye Django's Tiger - Django Reinhardt Night and Day - Cole Porter It Was a Good Day - Ice Cube Beast of Burden - The Rolling Stones There are many more great songs to play, but in providing you with this short list, I hope I can encourage you to trace down some of the great musical lineages and discover some great tunes on your own and that match your taste and style.

            "answer_text": "You didn't mention anything regarding style. My playing has been largely right hand focused, so what's fun for me to play will tend to lean that way. Obviously it depends on your skill level how fun any given song will be. I imagine that this   is an amazingly fun song to play...if you can pull it off. I actually have the sheet music for it. Bar 5 starts with a chord I can't play. Not I can't change into and out of it in any sort of reasonable time...I can't stretch my fingers far enough apart to fret all of the notes at the same time. That said, it's a lot of fun to tackle a piece that is above your current level and sometimes you find that some amazingly beautiful music isn't actually above your level at all. When you've been learning a piece and you notice yourself playing it in the background while thinking about something else is one of the greatest feelings. Songs that lend themselves to this sort of thing follow patterns that your hands learn and and up being able to do largely without you having to spend the whole time thinking about it. \"Dust in the Wind\" by Kansas is one of my favorites:   It's very simple (not to be confused with easy!) The right hand mostly follows one simple pattern while the left hand alternates between C and Am with a consistent variation in the outlying fingers. You have to start slow...in my case so slow that it didn't even sound like the song I was trying to play. I learned the pattern to the point where I could do other things while I was practicing it. I was thinking about a homework problem one day when I heard Dust in the Wind playing in the background. It took me a moment to realize that it was coming out of my guitar.  I'd also recommend pretty much anything by Nick Drake. He used a lot of non-standard tunings which is fun in its own right, but even without that he was such an amazing guitarist it's an awesome feeling to even come close to pulling off some of his songs:https://tommyemmanuel.wordpress.com/nick-drake/  Standard tuning, awesome folk \"Blossom\":  https://tommyemmanuel.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/nick-drake-blossom-friend.pdfBEBEBE easier than it sounds \"Harvest Breed\": Page on wordpress.comAlso BEBEBE, amazing feeling when you nail the right hand variations at the end \"Fly\": Page on wordpress.comBBDGBE Just wow \"Three Hours\": DRAKE: Three hours",
