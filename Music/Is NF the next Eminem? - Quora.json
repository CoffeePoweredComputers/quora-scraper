            "answer_text": " While NF could continue growing to the point where he leaves a mark on the rap game as big as Eminem's, he's not the next Eminem. Both artists have taken extremely different paths on their career. Eminem got his start being mentored by rap legend, Dr. Dre. He thing went on to redefine Shock Rap, delivering three classic albums. At the time he came up he also had to fight against prejudices against him due to skin color alone, making his success even more admirable. He was one of the artists to make an opening for white rappers in the culture. He's continuing to find success twenty years later. NF got his start making Christian music. He released a couple albums before finally finding mainstream success with songs \u201cLet You Down\u201d and \u201cLie\u201d. His recent album \u201cThe Search\u201d beat out Chance The Rapper for a number 1 spot, but he still has yet to be respected within the rap game. He hasn't made a classic album nor been largely recognized as an important artist. Neither have a similar story. Neither made it big off similar topics. Neither found success at the same rate from the same communities. NF's career is still young, however. He has many years to create something as big as the Slim Shady LP or the Marshall Mathers LP. Whether or not he will is yet to be seen, but his potential isn't fully exhausted yet. I can't see NF being the next Eminem. They might occasionally have similar rap styles, but their levels of success and respect can't be compared. If NF does make a mark on rap culture, it will be his own, unable to be compared to anyone else's. ",

            "answer_text": "These are two rappers that were not made to be compared to each other. Yes, their music styles are quite similar, and NF is on the rise, but I think it\u2019s closed-minded to say that one rapper is \u201cthe next -insert more experienced and popular rapper-.\u201c I think so especially because there is a growing chance that NF could become more popular and respected than Eminem in the future. (No disrespect to Eminem.) Then it would seem silly to refer to him as \u201cThe Next Eminem.\u201d When he has already surpassed Eminem. So just let NF be his own person instead of making it seem as if he\u2019s the shadow of another rapper. ",
