            "answer_text": "I think it would have been some major problem in your life that just changed your perspective towards music but i think music is still one of the best ways to overcome that problem. Best way to go back to the music is to listen music which gives you some sense of relief,entertainment and also helps you in keeping your morale high. And according to me RAP And HIP-HOP is the ultimate path because the beats and music is quite awesome.you can listen to Eminem,Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre etc. Another way which i prefer mainly is the classic rock music of 60's and 70's for example- The Beatles,Simon and Garfunkel etc because of their relieving and soothing songs. There can be another way as to listen the songs which you loved at some time of your life but that is not for everyone as one needs to be strong from inside and after listening and remembering the past this can lead to even more hatred for music. I hope my answer will help you in getting back to listening and enjoying music. ",

            "answer_text": "Don't make it a task. Listening, enjoying music is as natural as living and breathing. You mostly lose interest in music when you keep listening to songs that you just don't like. When you say you've \u201clost\u201d interest, there must've been a point of time when you would've loved music. Try listening to songs that made you feel that then. Try to think of that genre of music which has always lifted your spirits or calmed you down. You'll start going back to those songs again eventually, and more like those, because these are emotions we feel everyday. Music will, as a result, again become an integral part in processing those emotions. Hope this helps a little. ",
