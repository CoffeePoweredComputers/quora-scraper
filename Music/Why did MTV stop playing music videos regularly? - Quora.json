            "answer_text": "Short answer: Money. 1/2 hour programming targeted at teens and young adults got bigger ratings and therefore MTV could charge more for advertisements. Longer Answer: What, exactly was wrong with music videos? At some point in the 90s, music started getting more, hm, I don\u2019t want to say fragmented because it\u2019s always been fragmented \u2014 I know: isolationist. In other words, accompanying the fragmentation was now a sense of \u201cI like what I like and I don\u2019t want to be bothered with crap I don\u2019t like.\u201d If there was one amazing thing about MTV, it was that it got millions to watch several music genres that came all at once. I mean, you could be seeing a Duran Duran video one moment, followed by a Scorpions video the next, followed by Lionel Richie, next. Think about it in the context of today\u2019s society: That\u2019s insane. Never would you hear a radio station programmed that way. It was preposterous to assume that people would put up with that sort of free-form programming. And yet, we did just that. After school, we sat in front of our TVs for hours on end in, what can now be called the Original Binge Watching. The retro-active term given for society at that time is The Monoculture, i.e., a period where everyone reasonably knew what else was going on that was popular in music, movies or TV. Whether it was The Godfather, Star Wars, or Different Strokes or Thriller or Purple Rain. And then\u2026 \u2026We entered a phase where generations were different. Kids did not like what their older siblings listened to. The white kids didn\u2019t want to listen to what the black kids listened to. Parents ran away from all the edgy stuff on radio. Metal heads would no longer stand for waiting through a sea of Madonna vids. New wave fans felt lost after the likes of Culture Club and the Thompson Twins fell out of style. (shockingly though, recent years have seen the rise of \u201cJACK\u201d radio stations that, pretty much mimic the MTV formula: hits from the 70s, 80s, and 90s along with R&B and Metal sprinkled in here and there. What Goes Around\u2026) So MTV started shedding viewers in the 90s, and turned to standard programming to get them back. The Monoculture has disappeared. Who knows if it\u2019ll ever return? ",

            "answer_text": "As someone who was around watching MTV like crazy in those days, I can tell you the answer of this one. MTV did very well at getting viewers over the years just playing videos. But some people wanted to see a wider diversity of videos, not just rock and pop, but rap, R&B, and other styles. I remember when it was a big deal they played Michael Jackson\u2019s Billie Jean in their regular programming, because black artists didn\u2019t really get much play back then. As time when on, they had shows like Yo MTV Raps, and 120 Minutes (which focused on alternative music videos) and Headbanger\u2019s Ball (which played metal videos). They found these blocks of shows not only did well, but had regular viewers who tuned in at the specific times these shows were on, something MTV had not really seen before. In the old days you turned it on and left it on, but as people got tired of the VJ or just watching the same music videos over and over they would tune out. Now people were tuning in for specific shows. In the 1980s they developed a style show, a news show, a club show and a game show, all still relatively music related. These shows were getting higher ratings than when the regular music videos were playing, which is what led to the development of The Real World, the first real MTV show that was NOT music related. Not only did Real World get ratings, everyone was also talking about it. It even did well in the encore presentations, getting ratings higher than music videos on their own. This show in particular seemed to lead MTV away from music videos and into other types of programming. The Real World is still on, if I am not mistaken, and led to shows like Road Rules, Real World Vs. Road Rules, and The Challenge. Once MTV saw how successful non music programming could be, they started to make more and more shows, and program less and less free music video time. I have not watched MTV in at least 5 years (nor much TV), so I cannot talk about the state of the network now. But when you create one show one time, and reruns of it are getting you higher ratings than showing music videos, you know what is going to happen to the network. ",
