            "answer_text": "Not really, no. In a serious (\u201cI\u2019m out of strings and my last one broke or something) situation a improvised TEMPORARY replacement might work, but the only real similarity between a standard bass and guitar is they both have necks. A bass neck is several inches longer and regular guitar strings most likely won\u2019t reach the tuning pegs, then there\u2019s the intonation issue and the electronic fact that a thinner guitar string won\u2019t impact the pickups in the same way. The bridge and nut are grooved for much thicker strings as well. BUT, never say never. When I was delegated as bass player in my 12\u201313 yr olds First Real Band, I had no idea there was a difference and all I had to go on was speciation and fuzzy Paul McCartney photos, so my Dad found a Kay 6 String electric ( a real \u201clog\u201d) and we removed two tuning pegs and made a makeshift 4 string nut and he bought me very heavy gauge guitar strings. I have little memory of how it actually sounded because I had no idea what a real bass was supposed to sound like! But there I was in our first group picture, thumping 1\u20135,1\u20135 to \u201cHang on Sloopy\u201d\u2026 But if you don\u2019t need to go thru all that, use bass strings\u2026. Play on! ",

            "answer_text": "Normally I would say you couldn't do this as guitar strings would be too short and there might be issues with the (,lack of) string tension and the effect on the truss rod as well. However, I did once see someone playing a Fender Bass VI in a bar in Puerto Rico with a mixture of guitar and and bass strings. A bass VI is a 6 string short scale Bass (30\u2033) tuned one octave below a guitar. If I recall correctly, the bottom 4 were the Bass strings and the top B and E were guitar strings so he could play the bass lines and add the odd guitar fill. ",

            "answer_text": "NO! They are different sizes and gauges. There are 5 string basses and 6 string basses now. Back when I learned to play bass guitar it only had 4 strings. If you're asking me for an opinion or endorsement, I would personally recommend GHS Boomers Medium Gauge. They cost a little more but they stay in tune well and I've played a lot of shows with them. Also, I usually only have to change strings once a year. Don't cut corners to save a few bucks. If you're going to play in front of people, you should try to give them the best product you can deliver. There is no substitute for quality! ",

The problem is, you will need to replace the nut, because your new strings are much thinner than the bass strings, and you will most likely experience buzz .
