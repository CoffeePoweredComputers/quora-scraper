            "answer_text": "U.S. perspective: There are no audio recordings in the public domain. Due to a quirk in copyright law, all recordings gained copyright in 1969, lasting for 95 years. ALL OF THEM. Exception: recordings made by the Federal government are, by law, all in the public domain. But pretty sure you weren't asking about recordings by the National Marine Marching Band. Sheet music goes into the public domain 70 years after the composer dies (before 1974 it was just a flat 95 years). So you're talking about old music. Is that what you wanted?  I wonder if you have the wrong definition for \u201cpublic domain\u201d. Some people use this word for works that the public has access to. The word for that is \u201cpublished\u201d. If it isn't published, no one has any access to it at all. If it is published, people can buy in, stream it, hear it on the radio. But you can't use it. Copyright law forbids using anyone's content without permission. ",

            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: IANAL. Music Copyrights are quirky because you actually have two distinct, and according to US Copyright Law, separate, sets of Intellectual Property: the composition, and the audio recording of that composition. You can license a composition (the song itself) and make your own recording (e.g., a cover of that song), and you would own the recording rights to your cover version but not to the original composition. This is how cover bands can do what they do legally - the cover band has to pay licensing fees to the original composers of the songs they cover, but their covers (the audio recordings) are then the band\u2019s own works and thus are owned by the band. (Or, more commonly, their record label via contract.) As was already noted by other posters, all music and audio recordings in the US have different Copyright durations depending on when they were composed and whether/if they were properly kept up-to-date Copyright registration wise, but this is strictly for the original compositions themselves. Any recordings of those compositions will have their own separate rights and require their own separate licensing.

Alan Price dug up a PD song called House Of The Rising Sun and updated it with an original guitar and organ arragenement and it made money for the band and he gets 10% for arranging it. You can record PD records so long as you don\u2019t step on the feet of someone who owns the masters. Also understand sound recordings could be considered in copyright in some countries. ",
