            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. I think, this is a course for you:Course | UVic MIRYou will find here slides, videos and assignments. The course is conducted by George Tzanetakis who is well known in the MIR community. At the above site you can also find his book, however it is still a draft. Next website with MIR resources that you can find helpful is MIR workshop 2013 (there are also assignments). If you want to have some quick fun with MIR than you can use some library that has just implemented MIR primitives - for example bmcfee/librosa (MFCC, chromagram, beat tracking). Have fun! ",
