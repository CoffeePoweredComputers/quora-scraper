            "answer_text": "No. The old Taylor Swift was an illusion. Since Red I believe Taylor has been showing less and less of the pop country princess she was originally billed as and more of the real Taylor. It\u2019s interesting to look back to the MySpace days, before she got famous, and see the snark she left for and about her friends, and her relative openness about her relationship with Emily Poe; she was definitely a bit of a punk as a teenager, and I think she\u2019s letting the mature version shine through after having been hidden behind a PR image for so long. Everything about her \u2014 her voice, her attitude, her comfort with her sexuality, her songs themselves \u2014 have matured. The acoustic guitar is still there, but the white dress and affected accent are long gone. She\u2019s been busily chipping away at her man-eating straight girl image, forcefully advocating for feminism and LGBT+ rights, slowly filling in the blanks where her activism has skipped in the past. This seems to be the Taylor MySpace Tay always wanted to be. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Mostly likely, she never will be. Back to the heart of a child she had. Few can ever find another to sustainably put in the effort to reassure an abandoned hearted person that they are loved, wanted, and worthy of not having been abandoned in the first place. Her mother did what she could. How do find a person that can love you like a mother\u2019s love for a child? Your bff you Cleve to when grown? Those are married off as teens. Taylor has touched the hearts on millions possibly billions of people. Odds are there is that\u2019s compatible that\u2019s wife has died. Maybe that person just wrote something like this to her, for her and she need only meet them to feel that it\u2019s true! ",
