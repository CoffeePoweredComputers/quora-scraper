            "answer_text": "If you specifically mean mainstream contemporary Christian worship music (CCM), well, it is meant to be simple enough and catchy enough to be worthy of use for corporate worship. The purpose of worship music is to help a whole congregation focus on intently worshipping God, on concentrating on the message of the song. The music is just meant to be a basic format to help everyone follow along, so the music written for worship must not be counterproductive to that. People like myself who typically like more technically complex, less formulaic music\u2014or even just music that tries foremost to be aesthetically pleasing\u2014might struggle with this at first. I know I did. We might have the temptation to get on a high horse, and to consider the music 'dumbed down' for some others who can't keep up with our musical preferences. However, according to the teachings of the Bible, praising God and making God accessible should take preference over worldly matters. Therefore, disciples with these perhaps more intellectually advanced tastes, are called to do away with such prejudices; and to accept that at least group worship requires simpler musical settings of the text.  However, there is a wide variety of music marketed as \"Christian music\"\u2014not counting all the music merely written by God-breathed disciples and according with Biblical principles, that aren't necessarily songs of worship\u2014and it includes various genres and levels of musical intricacy. 2000s metal? P.o.D. '70s\u2013'80s hard rock? Petra. Experimental? Danielson Famile (my personal favorite, of what few non-CCM artists I've explored the music of). Many of these artists' work is not suitable for corporate worship. It might be okay for individual worship if the lyrics contain worship themselves; and if the listener can still focus on the message of the song, despite all the cool compositional stuff. Otherwise, just listening to them for music without sinful content is okay as well. ",

            "answer_text": "I can understand why some people would think Christian music boring. I used to think country music was boring although many people would disagree with that. It all relates to what you think makes a song special. The main purpose of Contemporary Christian music is the message, whether it be one of worship, praise, or gratitude to God. The lyrics are designed to inspire, encourage and give hope to the listener. This is what sets it apart from other genres. One day I heard a song that sounded country and I thought \u201cWow, I like that.\u201d Turned out to be a Christian song. I had the radio on a Christian station and didn\u2019t know it at the time. The more I listened the more I liked it. Then I bought the CD\u2019s of the artists I liked and from there became a fan for life. Maybe you just haven\u2019t found a song or group you really like that touches your heart. Depending on what you\u2019re into there are rock, pop, even rap music out there. As one who is an avid music lover I can say some Christian music sounds OK, others are good, then there are those favorites you just can\u2019t get enough of. Contemporary Christian music may not be your cup of tea but, it\u2019s never boring. ",
