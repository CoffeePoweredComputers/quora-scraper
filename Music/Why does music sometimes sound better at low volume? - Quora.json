            "answer_text": "That\u2019s an interesting question, and I believe there are a number of possible components to the answer. So\u2026 1 If the sound is loud, you need to raise your voice to communicate with your companion(s) Shouting is a warning signal and raises our levels of stress. An early lesson for me as a sound engineer was to mix quiet, partly to keep the vibe in the studio comfortable and collegial. 2. Equal loudness curves - at low levels our ear/brain combination is less sensitive to low and high frequencies. As the volume increases, our sensitivity flattens out. If a mid-heavy balance suits the music, you may prefer it at low volumes. 3. Distortion and other unpleasantnesses. - if the volume of the music is causing the amps and speakers to start distorting you may well be eager to turn the levels down! Transistor amp and loudspeaker distortion has none of the \u201ceuphoric\u201d second order harmonic distortion that tube amps exhibit - better said, there are lots of odd order harmonics as part of the mix and the sound is just plain offensive, even in small amounts. High-quality audio gear can reproduce much higher levels at relatively low distortion figures. 4. You\u2019re human - your mood, the familiarity with the music, the time of day and many other factors can affect your perception of sound. Stress is another major contributing factor. You may well have experienced other factors. Bear them in mind! ",

            "answer_text": "Depending on what you\u2019re listening to\u2026 If the Songs that you find actually sound better at lower volumes, were Produced during the height of the \u201cLoudness Wars\u201d, it might be seriously Over Compressed and Mixed to be Overly Loud, using \u201cBrickwall Limiting\u201d. The (flawed) idea during that time period, was pushed by the desire of many Bands to make their Songs sound \u201cLouder\u201d than anyone else\u2019s. So many Songs from that period are literally squashed within a fraction of being 100% Loud throughout the entire Song. Really, it doesn\u2019t sound nearly as good as music Mastered with a wider dynamic range, and is often actually very fatiguing to listen to, especially for a long listening session. Thankfully, these days, most Bands, Mixing Engineers, Mastering Engineers and Producers are getting away from the practice of Overdoing this type of extreme Compression. ",
