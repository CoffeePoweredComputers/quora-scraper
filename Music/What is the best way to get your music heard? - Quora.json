            "answer_text": "Getting your music heard in 2018 is both easier and harder than it\u2019s ever been. I say that it\u2019s easier because, as independent songwriters and producers, we have more tools than ever before to write, mix, master and promote our music. The days of artists necessarily being slave to record labels are over. You can do the whole 9 yards of creating an album/EP/single, so long as you\u2019re willing to do some googling. Putting your music out there is accessible to anybody with a laptop and $50 to spend on digital distribution. At the same time, since nearly everybody has access to this technology, there\u2019s also more content than ever before. The number of options listeners have to choose from has increased drastically since the days of records cut on vinyl, and the immediacy with which they can access it, hear it, and decide if they like it or not is unprecedented in the industry. In other words, getting your music online so everybody can hear it is very doable. Getting it to \u201cstand out from the crowd\u201d is now tougher than it\u2019s ever been. I speak with the limited experience of having released 2 independent EP\u2019s. However, my advice on these two things is\u2026 For getting your music online If you can afford it, use a service like Distrokid, CDBaby, or TuneCore to get your music on Spotify, Apple Music, and other streaming services.Ensure that you purchase the rights to any cover songs you have on your album/EP. Services like Loudr will do this for you relatively easily.Don\u2019t be a victim to the loudness war, and master your tracks at a reasonable volume. There may have been an argument for this before, but now streaming services limit the max volume of submitted tracks. This means that over-compressing your tracks won\u2019t get you anywhere!For getting your music heard Talk to local radio stations to see if they have a local music night. If they do, get your music on that-usually they are quite receptive to new artists and are trying to help people\u2019s songs get heard!Message playlist curators on SoundCloud and Spotify. These people have a lot of power in terms of deciding what gets popular and what doesn\u2019t. If you can land your song on a playlist, it can bump your plays up from the hundreds to the hundreds of thousands.Share your music with your friends and family, and all work together to get your song above the 1,000 play threshold on Spotify. Believe it or not, this can help with other people\u2019s willingness to give your music a chance.Post your music on dedicated forums for music sharing. Most of the time, this isn\u2019t super effective, but every once in a while you can gain some new fans!Perhaps the most important thing is to make sure that you take your time producing your music. If something isn\u2019t truly ready to be released, don\u2019t release it! Work on it until it\u2019s as good as you can make it, don\u2019t listen for a week, come back and make final edits, then stage it for release. In a world where we\u2019re constantly bombarded by professionally produced media, anything that doesn\u2019t reach a certain quality margin is automatically discounted by most consumers. This isn\u2019t to say your music has to be over-produced, but whatever aesthetic you\u2019re going for you should take the time to work out the kinks and absolutely nail it. Hope this helps in some way-good luck producing and promoting your music! ",

            "answer_text": "- Record short snippets of some of your original material (start with 10 - 15 snippets, snippets can be different parts of the same song, trim  - FB: join 20 - 30 FB groups related to your content/genre (FB allows for long videos) - TWITTER: follow people who are fans of similar artists to you on Twitter (if you sound like John Mayer, click on John Mayer's twitter account and follow his followers, you can follow about 120 every couple hours) ) (30 second videos max) - INSTAGRAM: repeat the twitter strategy (there is an app called \"crowdfire\" that makes this process faster) look it up on google and they have a blog that shows what the app can do (15 second videos max) - Post a new clip each day around 11AM on each one of the social media using the appropriate hastags (#band #rock, etc. if you are in a rock band #funk #soul #dangelo if you do neo-soul, etc.)  Each social media platform allows a different number of hastags, use only 1-2 for Twitter and FB but use about 15-20 for Instagram.   Share your videos with each of the FB groups each day, as well as posting them to your personal profile and music page.   - Each day spend time commenting, favoriting, liking and interacting with the people who begin to like your posts, this interaction will turn casual watchers into engaged people - Consistently follow this strategy, check the statistics of your tweets and posts to see what gets the most engagements and what doesn't work.  The things that are most liked, try and slightly alter what you create to match this.  This is marketing in a nutshell.  If you do this steadily you will develop a consistent interested crowd, provided your music is ready to share.  After only 2 weeks of using this strategy I have increased my weekly impressions on my page from 500 to 30,000 and engagements from 20-30 to 2,000, so I swear it really does work.  Make sure you respond to EVERY comment that is left, offer free music to people as well.   - When you get a new follower, don't ask them to listen to you right away.  Simply say hi and wish them a good week.  Gaining new fans is like dating.  If you grab a girls boobs within 10 seconds of knowing her, she will hit you and leave.  Give it time.  Develop an actual relationship with each person.  Read their posts, talk to them.   I know this is a bit lengthy but there is a science to doing this.  If you don't do it right, you won't get much results.  Also almost all labels are not worth shopping too.  They are oversaturated with talent trying to get in, they usually only give 360 deals (they own everything about you if you sign with them) and they typically have strict control over your artistic path.  If you are willing to put in the work, you can sustain your own career and tour without a label.  It's all about the fans.  They are your lifeblood.  Make what you do about them.  Find them by the methods I described and that will get you started.   I hope this helps.  Dylan ",
