            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s are some things that I learned in the music business: Save money up for the tour. If you can take your personal/favorite sound engineer with you. The mix will make or break even the most veteran talented bands out there. Be very frugal with your money on tour. Don\u2019t spend your money on beer and other non-essentials. Get an emergency credit card Don\u2019t put the name of your band or anything related on your van or trailer that is carrying your equipment. The thieves target bands because music equipment is the easiest to pawn/sell If you can, stay at friends/fans houses instead of a hotel/motel Make sure your mode of transportation is reliable. Get a AAA membership or other auto membership for towing if needed. Make sure that you understand the take (money) at the door. Some clubs will pay the band(s) after all the other possible costs (sound engineer, sound system) are paid for. Some clubs will only pay you based on the number of people you personally brought to the club. And of course, there is the pay to play situation. Just make sure you fully understand what you are getting into and make sure you have a means of making money. Sometimes you\u2019ll get paid little or nothing which is necessary to get your band\u2019s name out there but remember you have expenses to pay too. Be ready to work when you\u2019re not playing by putting up flyers around the town you are playing. Have merchandise (CD\u2019s, shirts, stickers) to sell and sometimes give away. Remember you have to market yourselves. Trust no one except your band members and even then make sure that they are on the up and up. There are people out there that want to take advantage of you at all angles. Be nice and courteous to everyone you meet or work together. The last thing you want to be is \u201cthat asshole band\u201d. Make sure all the band members and other support folks travelling with you agree on a basic set of principles and rules. This way everyone is clear on what the objective is. Do NOT be late to a gig. That is a club/venue owners major pet peeve. I am sure there are some that I missed but those are basic and important things that come to mind. And\u2026oh yeah\u2026have fun and enjoy the experience. ",
