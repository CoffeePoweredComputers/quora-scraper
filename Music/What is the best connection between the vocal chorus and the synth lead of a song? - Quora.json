            "answer_text": "As a bass player, everything I do has to serve the song, especially the lead vocal. There\u2019s no point in me wanting to do a fancy bass part if a simple bass line makes it sound better. What I have to do is play the simple part with as much commitment, grace and style as I can. The same goes for a synth lead. I love a good synth solo or lead line, but not if it fights with the vocals. Doubling of a vocal line - or part of a line - can work, as can a carefully constructed and unobtrusive harmony. Rhythmic or riffy parts can be good, if well arranged. People like hooks! ",

            "answer_text": "In Pop music (of any form) the instrumental leads tend to echo the vocal melody. If you listen to this song (or get the MIDI File), you will see that there is actually very little variation in here from the main core melody. This is good for Pop as it is easy for the audience to follow all of the parts even on first listen.  That said, the two should not be too close, or the whole track lacks variation or spark. It is in the balance beween familiar & different that music lives. ",
