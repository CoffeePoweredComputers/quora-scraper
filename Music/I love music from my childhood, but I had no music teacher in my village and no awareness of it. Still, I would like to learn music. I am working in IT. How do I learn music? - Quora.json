            "answer_text": "Depends on the way you want to produce music. You can produce music in the following ways: Through singingLearning an instrumentProducing EDM (Electronic dance music)Learning music is easy for some and can be difficult for many. I am going to share with you my example. I was born with Synesthesia. I picked up an instrument at the the age of 12 and somehow developed Perfect Pitch (ability to recognize notes) 3 years later. Those with perfect pitch, start their musical training before the age of 7. I am going to go over as to how you can learn music. 1) Through singing If you want to become a vocalist, decide on which type of music you want to sing. There are various genres of music. For example: Western classical musicPop musicBallad musicIndian classical music,etc.There are many more genres of music. (I am not a vocalist BTW) Anyway,go to the YouTube and type vocal range exercises and vocal warm up exercises. Sing along the notes and that way you can extend your range. Also try to improve the texture of your voice (You can also search that on the YouTube). Here\u2019s an example of a vocal warm up exercise.  You can also learn on how to produce harmony while singing. I know vocalists who can produce harmony without any instrument (comes with experience I guess). 2. Learning instrument I would give the same advice for learning instruments (go to the YouTube and search). If you want to learn music through instruments, the first thing (the most fundamental thing) that you should do is learn the music theory. If you want to play Indian instruments, then learn the Indian music theory (very different from Western Music theory ). If you want to learn an instrument that produces fast results I would go for the Keyboard. 3. Producing EDM There are many software that produce EDM. Examples: FL studio, Nuendo, Cubase, etc. But all of them are not free. Music theory is also the most fundamental thing in this case. You can search for tutorials on the YouTube as to how to produce EDM. All the Best and let me know what you have chosen. ",
