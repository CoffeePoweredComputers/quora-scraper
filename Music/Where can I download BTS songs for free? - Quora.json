            "answer_text": "As you\u2019d expect of a band as talked-about and in-demand as BTS, some of the world\u2019s biggest stars are lining up to work with them. There are two big-name collaborations on \u2018Map Of The Soul: Persona\u2019; one works better than the other. Halsey, a long-time friend of the group, appears on \u2018Boy With Luv\u2019, a colourful, summery pop song that references their 2014 single \u2018Boy In Luv\u2019. Her star power doesn\u2019t overshadow BTS\u2019, with her contribution. It\u2019s almost impossible to discuss BTS without mentioning the fandom! ",
