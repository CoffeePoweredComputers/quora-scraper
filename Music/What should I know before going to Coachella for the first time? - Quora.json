            "answer_text": "I'll update this as I think of other things: It is really hot during the day but gets really cold at night, so bring a sweater or something like that with you. Sometimes they let you bring water into the grounds and sometimes they don't, so it's not a bad idea to come with 2-3 bottles of water that you get at a supermarket, and then just chug them / ditch them if they aren't letting you bring water in. There is usually a ton of traffic into the venue, especially on Saturday and Sunday from about 1PM-3:30PM.  You can save a lot of time if you come in from the east (exit 144) and don't take the Monroe or Jefferson exits. If you have a smartphone with Google Maps, drop a pin or similar when you park so you can find your car.  If you leave after the last show, it's really dark, crowded and confusing, and you also don't leave the exact same way you go in, so it can be hard to find your car. It can be worth it to pay for parking at one of the side lots for $15/$20/$40 if there is bad traffic and you can spare the cash. Cell phone reception can be spotty so pick a spot and some times to meet with your friends if you get separated unexpectedly.  There are usually some nicer (than port-a-potties) bathrooms in trailers if you are willing to wait.  You can find them at the very end of the row of port-a-potties. Print out a paper schedule in advance since its hard to download the schedule on your phone and your battery might die. You'll have a much better time if you prepare for Coachella in advance by listening to a lot of the music from all the bands you are thinking of seeing. If you care about a band, go to the appropriate stage/tent before the show before the one you want to go and then work your way to the front.  It's really awesome to see your favorite bands up close and live.  It's generally more rewarding to be way up front for a few intense shows and then take breaks than bounce around from one thing you think is OK to the next. Don't worry about food too much.  Most places are good and the prices are more reasonable than other music festivals (usually). ",

            "answer_text": "IF you camp: bring a electronic stovetop (for cooking; the food at venue is delicious but can get expensive) and some camp gear (tents, tarp, canopy, lights). Make sure your car has good battery and secure your keys. The free shower is not as bad as you might think. It's basically on a mobile trailer with 10-15 stalls in each and they were kept clean all three days (paying for VIP shower is not worth it).  As for the event, GO TO THE DO LAB! I know camp grounds is a great place to cool during down time but @THEDOLAB they have shaded areas and the stage performers spray water! When I go there, I know I can't be disappointed.  Plan out your shows. Keep small group who are interested in same lineup as you. But also try to discover new artists.  Be safe. Stay hydrated and have a good time! ",

            "answer_text": "The most important piece of advice I can give is to CAMP!  I feel that people that don't camp don't get the full experience of Coachella.  After the shows end at midnight, everyone staying at a hotel must go back to them, everyone camping gets to party till the sun rises with thousands of other campers.  People don't tend to sleep and there are tons of activities to do till dawn. There is usually a roller rink with a DJ, LED swing sets with DJs, arts n crafts, afterparty dubstep tent, and tons of other fun things to do during the after party. Also, if you don't camp, you have no where to go chill and hang out during the day if you have down time (believe me you will want down time).  You also won't have anywhere to put your stuff, so everything you need for the day you have to bring and carry with you. ",
