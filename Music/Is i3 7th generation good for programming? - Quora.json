            "answer_text": "Intel's 7th generation i3 processors are 2 core 4 thread parts, you are asking about programming which means you will also use powerful IDEs like Visual Studio or Android Studio which will benefit from as much processing power as possible. The current offering from Intel and AMD are far superior with 4 cores and 4 threads from both the companies. You should definitely try to go for an i3 8th Generation or a Ryzen 3 2nd generation. Or presumably wait for the 3rd Generation of Ryzen 3 from AMD which are supposed to bump the core count to 6 core 12 threads if the current leaks are to be believed. So even though the i3 7th Gen chips are great, the market currently has far better choices to go with. Cheers ^_^ ",
