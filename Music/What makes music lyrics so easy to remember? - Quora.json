            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve learned here on Quora that there are two main facilitators to information retention: Association andRepetitionMusic just happens to be rich in both. When you listen to a song, you\u2019re listening to melodies and harmonies, which in turn elicits feelings. This feelings might make you remember something from your past, or a place you\u2019ve been in, or general memories you have. You\u2019re also, in many cases, listening to short sentences and rhymes. Professional producers know how to maniputale feelings by playings certain harmonies and melodies. So if they think a certain part of the lyrics should convey a certain feeling, they\u2019ll compose the harmony with this objective in mind. Professional lyricists know how to make rhymed sentences lubricated to be easy to sing. So you, as the listener, will now have words and feelings and memories to absord. Simultaniously. And this is what makes songs so easy to remember. They carry association and repetition in themselves: the words are associated with the feelings you get from the sounds and beats, that in turn ignites memories; the lyrics are associated with themselves through rhymes, creating a big net of lyrics-harmonies-memories that you consume in 3 minutes (considering most radio songs). If both producers and lyricists make a good job, you\u2019ll want to listen again. And you can repeat a 3 minute song 20 times in an hour. Now let\u2019s compare this to books. When you learn from books, association and repetition are way harder to achieve. Association depends on previous books you read, previous knowledge and experience you\u2019ve gathered and so on. Your repetition is spread in a larger time scale, due to how long it takes to read a whole book cover to cover. __ So what can you do, with this information, to remember lessons from school the way you remember songs (the core of the question)? I suggest two things: Use mnemonics to enforce association:Mnemonics make use of elaborative encoding, retrieval cues, and imagery as specific tools to encode any given information in a way that allows for efficient storage and retrieval. Mnemonics aid original information in becoming associated with something more meaningful\u2014which, in turn, allows the brain to have better retention of the information. Wikipedia A great example of mnemonics is found in that movie Cheats (2002). Even though this example is about teenagers using music to remember the answers for the test they\u2019re making, or, an example of cheating, you can use this more nobly. (Jump to 1:01:50 to watch the scene when they use a form of mnemonics)  2. Make a studying schedule that have structured repetition as a goal. I\u2019m not an expert on this but I\u2019ve seen, also here on Quora, this graph. It summarizes the idea of structured repetition. What it shows is the impact of subject reminders on the projected \u201cforgetting curves\u201d. The more you remind (or repeat), the longer it takes to forget.  Hope I\u2019ve helped. ",

            "answer_text": "I remember hearing in a sermon entitled Music Paints Pictures that the rhythm of a song lends itself to memorization. There is a flow to music that can best be understood by listening to classical music. It paints pictures for us to enjoy without even using words. Quite often, while driving down the road, I'll hear a song that I hadn't even thought of in years, yet the words come back to me as naturally as breathing. As much as I would love to attribute it to a perfect memory, my wife reminds me almost daily that that isn't the case. What I think it really is is that I've connected that song to a memory, a feeling, or sometimes, even the weather. Sometimes, songs that become popular are so overplayed, you can't help but remember the lyrics. They become earworms that you can't drive out of your head, no matter how hard you try. If you are trying to teach a child the ABC's, you could probably say them plainly and without a rhythm or any emotion. In a matter of a couple months, if you are lucky, the child should be able to say them without too much difficulty. However, when you set the alphabet to a song, maybe Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star, the child learns in a matter of hours, days at most. Enjoy the music, remember the lyrics, and in the words of the group named Kiss, shout it out loud! ",

            "answer_text": "Three things: Exposure- while you might not have been conscious of it, it is entirely possible that you\u2019ve listened to that song many times. It may have been playing in malls, schools or places you frequented. This repetition helps your brain store the song lyrics (sometimes more often than it does your lessons)Emotions- more often than not, songs are linked to feelings. Again, you may or may not be conscious of it, but certain songs we heard when at a point of strong emotions are often associated with what we were feeling. As a result, many and not just one area of the brain is engaged in the interaction with the said song.Muscle memory- much like riding a bike, some songs become part of the subconscious part of the brain. It makes for easy recall.Much of it is explained here. ",

There is a rhythm, a musicality that's followed throughout the verses and makes it possible to learn by heart long poetries as well as modern songs. Plus, as suggested by somebody else, exposure to radios and music broadcasting channels everywhere and at every hour of the day and the night makes lyrics stuck with us quite easy. ",

Music is a short cut to the consciousness and to memory too: there are probably studies and papers on the subject, but it is a fact that we all know instinctively. This is why kids are taught a song to remember the letters of the alphabet, why multiplication tables are chanted in a \u2018sing-song\u2019 way - they do still do that. don\u2019t they? ",
