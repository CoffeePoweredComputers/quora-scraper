            "answer_text": "There are a number of ways to raise compression. One of the most common ways on the 350 Chevrolet engine is changing the cylinder heads. There are a dizzying number of cylinder heads available for the Chevrolet small-block. For more than 40 years Chevrolet has developed heads for all types of uses, including stock, high-performance, smog emissions, and over-the-counter all-out race heads. And these are just Chevrolet\u2019s heads and does not include aftermarket developers. Changing the pistons to taller pistons or different dome configurations, different crankshafts and connecting rods can alter compression ratio as well and/or a combination off some or all of the above. To me, the simplest way is a head swap unless you are building an engine from scratch. Then, it is best to consult an engine builder. For high performance engines, I rely upon my engine builder for advise on what combinations of parts to use. I assemble the engines, but I do not always select the parts to work together inside the engines. The \u2018old school\u2019 way is to pull the heads for a valve job and have the mating surface \u2018milled\u2019 or shaved by a machine shop to reduce combustion chamber volume. Even different style head gaskets can make a difference. ",

            "answer_text": "Figure out what they did to lower it and, errr\u2026 undo that. There are several possibilities. They might have put in a smaller throw crank, so the piston doesn\u2019t travel as far on each stroke. To make up the shortfall in the distance at the top, maybe longer conrods were put in at the same time, or taller pistons. Alternatively, maybe it has a different head, with larger combustion chambers. Or maybe a combination of these things. It doesn\u2019t take that much to change 10:1 to 7.6:1, it\u2019s only a 24% change in swept volume. You might be better off finding a block and head from an engine that has the compression ratio you need, rather than try to mod a low comp one. Dropping the comp ratio for emissions is a bit silly IMO - it\u2019s actually lowering the thermal efficiency. A modern engine can achieve the 10:1 or even more, and still have low emissions by metering the fuel a hell of a lot more precisely. ",
