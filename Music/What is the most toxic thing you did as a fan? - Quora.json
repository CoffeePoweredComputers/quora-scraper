Now I just scroll past the hate lmao, I got used to it and don\u2019t care anymore. I would also occasionally read fanfiction. Some people are okay with them, but now I think fanfiction is quite toxic cause they reinforce the delusional behavior, and many of them romanticize violence/mental health issues or sexualize the boys. Other than that, I think I\u2019ve been quite a good fan. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever fangirled over an artist. ",

One person called me a little b**** and I got really defensive over it and i told them that they were being mean and I didn't like it (I was 9 at the time) they actually got removed from the amino which was sad since we had made up and became pretty good friends.
