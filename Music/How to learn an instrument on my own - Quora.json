            "answer_text": "Depends on what level you'd like to achieve.1) Beginner:\u2014You can make notes on instruments played by blowing (you can buzz on woodwind or brass instruments)\u2014You can play basic songs, tackle basic rhythms\u2014Sheet music is highly recommended to learn. Here, you can sight read basic songs, and anything that's a big harder, you can get right after a bit of practice\u2014you learn your first scale. Typically, concert Bb \u2014you\u2019re uncertain about committing too much money into this hobby \u2014you rent an instrument, borrow one (like from a public place), or find a cheap one (only few hundred dollars) 2) Between Beginner and intermediate\u2014on blown instruments, you can more consistently play notes and sustain them. Imp\u2014Your sheet music sight reading improves to incorporate more complex rhythms harmonies, and melodies\u2014keyboard and percussion, play more complex notes 3) Intermediate\u2014on blown instruments your tone improves, as well as your range. Articulation and dynamics are also better\u2014your endurance is higher. You can play longer pieces with shorter breaks \u2014keyboard instruments\u2026 you can play even more complex chords, and your fingers are quick enough to play 16th and even 32nd notes (although actual speed varies by tempo) \u2014you\u2019re familiar with some of the famous names in music, like Mozart, Beethoven, and John Phillip Sousa to name a very few \u2014you\u2019re willing to sink in more money for an instrument. Not bank breaking, but far from \u201cimpulse buy\u201d \u2014You\u2019ve done research into what brands and models would suit your needs 4) Advanced \u2014It takes you much fewer practices to get a piece ready for concerts and showing off (e.g. 8 rehearsals vs. 13) \u2014you can sight read a majority of the sheet music correctly the first time \u2014Much of the rhythms, patterns, notes, and expressions are a sort of \u201cmuscle memory\u201d that you don\u2019t even need to really think about them to play them. 5) Expert/Professional \u2014you can participate in competitions and probably expect to do very good, if not win \u2014You can actually make money off your talent \u2014in the quote: Amateurs Practice Until They Get It Right Professionals Practice Until They Can\u2019t Get It Wrong \u2026 you\u2019re in the latter camp . Amongst those 5 stages above (mind you, something I came up with, and not anything of \u201cmusical scientific method\u201d nor official), on average, I\u2019d say many should seek instruction around step # 1.5. Yes, it\u2019s possible that someone needs instruction from the get-go, while someone gifted can achieve reach the end on their own. However, I\u2019d recommend going with an instructor for several reasons: They have knowledge that they can share, which takes the guesswork out of many thingsIf you\u2019re really not cut out for it, they can provide you that unbiased opinionHaving another set of ears, one that\u2019s experience listen to your tone, pitch, rhythm, dynamics, etc. is invaluable. Even if you record yourself playing, you\u2019re still not \u201cgetting another set of ears on it\u201dThey can help motivate you. For example, one piano teacher of mine suggested that after this class, I completely stop playing \u201cpiece X\u201d. She felt I\u2019ve been doing it to death, it\u2019d be good to put it on hibernate, and I\u2019ve got other pieces and exercises to work on anyways. I resumed \u201cpiece X\u201d a week later, and gotta say, it worked out pretty well!If you\u2019re paying for it, you\u2019ll hopefully be motivated to practice, and make a better effort. For you, since you\u2019re sinking money and time. For the instructor since they may drop you if they feel you\u2019re not doing your due diligence.If there\u2019s an ensemble involved, you can have the experience of playing with others, and helping each other out.",

            "answer_text": "The simple answer is yes; in theory you can teach yourself almost anything through books (and other resources) and intuition - but consider the value of mentors and teachers, even for those who are very talented and able to self-educate. Eventually you may outgrow your teacher, but they can help put you on the fast track to getting up to their level (and beyond). We all start as beginners, and beginners can always benefit from some basic direction and teaching (though the teacher must be very good in proportion to the student\u2019s innate talent, otherwise there can be counter-productive effects). I play two instruments fairly well, piano I took lessons for many years, guitar I never had a single lesson. However, I did have a friend kind of mentor and guide me on guitar. We never sat down for more than a few minutes at a time to really do any \u201clessons\u201d, but we would play together (jam, etc) and he definitely inspired me to become an advanced guitarist. I put a lot of things together by using other resources and my own creativity, but he made a huge difference in helping me out with good habits and technique from the very start. ",
