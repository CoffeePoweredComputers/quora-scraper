            "answer_text": "According to The Beatles it's  \"Good Morning, Good Morning.\" Or even  \"Good Day Sunshine\" which can either be said straight to a child, or sarcastically by police to a petty criminal they\u2019ve caught in the act. Personally I tend to just use \"Morning\", and if the weather is really bad I might add \"And please note that I didn't say Good\" and look at the weather. In the UK, the correct greeting however is \"How do you do\", usually said as one word \"Howdoyoudo\". The correct response to this greeting is \"Howdoyoudo\". As is their wont, Americans have yanked several letters out like this \"Howdoyoudo\", which leaves \"Howdy\". ",

            "answer_text": "I'd say that in business, school and social settings the appropriate term is, 'Good Morning'. When greeting friends, family and sometimes in less 'formal' situations \u2018morning\u2019 is appropriate. However, it depends on who you are speaking to, some older family members might prefer 'Good Morning', your supervisor at work might be a 'morning' person. There is no hard and fast rule that I know about. You could always Google Miss Manners for another opinion. ",

Also removes the bias of using morning as the only time of day to address someone in a formal manner when seeing them for the first time of that day. ",
