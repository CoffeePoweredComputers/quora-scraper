            "answer_text": "Thanx for the A2A Sally. My very first foray into learning to play an instrument was piano lessons when I was around 8yrs old. I lasted about 3 months of weekly lessons and stomped my feet until my father let me quit. They were the most boring 45mins of my week. In retrospect I wish I would have stuck with them. I can play the piano/keys today, but I have to learn the piece first. I can\u2019t sight read sheet music. I can read it and I can play with both hands, but it takes me time to learn the piece. In 4th grade, around 9yrs old I took up the trumpet in elementary school. My older brother had one and tried to learn to play it, so I inherited it. I wanted to play the Sax, but my father refused to pay the rental fee or purchase one for me, so it was trumpet or nothing. I played it for 2yrs and gave it up. Hated the way it made my lips feel. I could play and in tune, but I found it to be kinda nerdy and I didn\u2019t want that persona lol. (Again in retrospect, it\u2019s a cool instrument..should have gave it a longer chance). When I turned 10 the world changed for me. I was ALWAYS into music, loved going to the record store and buying 45rpm\u2019s. They were under $1us and I could listen to my favorite songs without having to find $9\u201310 for the whole album. Oh I got them too, but to me 45\u2019s were the way to go. For christmas in 1977 my father gave me one present..Kiss Alive. And that was it. I wanted to be Ace Frehley and play a Les Paul !! I hounded my father for months to get me a guitar. Luckily his favorite son, my brother wanted one too or I would have had to save up forever to get one myself. He bought me a black Montoya Les Paul copy, my brother a Hondo Flying V and a 40w Marlboro amp for us to share. We found a teacher and both took lessons. My brother quit within a month and I lasted about 6. The guy was a horrible teacher. I really think it makes a huge difference if your teacher keeps you engaged and teaches you some songs along the way. Not just exercises over and over and over. I quit the lessons but NEVER stopped playing. I started figuring out songs off my 45\u2019s and those new fangled things that came out called cassettes, they made it so much easier to rewind a million times to figure out the sections of a song. I formed my first band at 12yrs old and since I had a finished basement, my house became the main rehearsal space. Since all the instruments where left at my house, I played them too. I found that I was pretty good on the drums. I could kick out some awesome beats, stay in time and make my hands and feet do 4 different things without a hiccup. The bass came natural too. Being a guitar player made that learning curve easier I believe. I eventually bought myself a set of drums. A set of Pearl\u2019s. They were best to hell though. The shells were just wood, the covering had been removed and all the drums except the snare was missing the bottom skins. The cymbals were more or less pie tins. Didn\u2019t matter to me. I had a double bass kit all my own and I loved to play. I also found a bass at a garage sale one day for $15. It was a no-name POS but it worked. I didn\u2019t have a bass amp, but got one eventually. By the time I was 16, I was signing waivers swearing I wouldn\u2019t drink and playing in bars and clubs. I took a couple years off when I joined the Army when I was 17, but went right back to it upon my discharge. I stopped playing gigs about 10yrs ago when my back couldn\u2019t take the standing and the weight of my Les Pauls slung over my shoulder. Since then (and for a couple years prior to stopping) I record tracks on my home studio. I\u2019ve built up a fairly decent one. It\u2019s acoustically treated and fully loaded with gear. I\u2019ve done EP\u2019s and Demo\u2019s for some local bands and love to recreate my favorite songs..those ones I listened to on those 45\u2019s way back when and new stuff I like too. The guitar is my main love though. I would NEVER give up playing it. ",

            "answer_text": "When I was in third grade, I asked my father for a guitar. My parents promptly signed me up for clarinet lessons. To this day, I don\u2019t know why they chose that instrument for me. My brother got trumpet lessons, and my sister flute. I learned to play exactly three songs on that clarinet. One was a solo piece (Faith of our Fathers) and the other two were ensemble pieces which I played with my school band. I lasted just one year playing the clarinet. I really hated it! Around the same time, I found a Hohner Marine Band harmonica on the sidewalk near my house. I cleaned it up, soaked it in some stolen whiskey (my older brother said I couldn\u2019t play it without disinfecting it first!) and I taught myself to play. I learned a bunch of songs I\u2019d heard on the radio and when my grandfather heard me play, he found an old book about how to play, which I studied for awhile - I learned to play Oh Suzannah from that book, and Beethoven\u2019s Ninth (well, part of it!)I still play harmonica, but since then I\u2019ve also added a lot of other instruments. When I was 18, I got my first guitar. Two years later, I got my first gig. I played occasionally until I was in my early thirties, when I started playing full time for a living, and teaching guitar lessons. In addition to the guitar, I also play recorder, pennywhistle, pan pipes, flute (very badly) and ukulele. I don\u2019t anymore, but a few years ago I picked up a clarinet at a friends house, and found that I can still play Faith of My Father on it without working too hard.I used to sing, but I have a voice injury which makes that problematic right now. I make music for a living. ",
