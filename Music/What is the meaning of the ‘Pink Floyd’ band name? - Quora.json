            "answer_text": "The article This One's Pink: Unraveling the Mysteries Behind the Pink Floyd Name by Mike McInnis goes into the most depth about the origin of Pink Floyd's name, busting a few minor myths in the process. Even the details of how Barrett became acquainted with their names have become muddled over the years. As the story goes, Barrett took the names from his record collection. Some take this to mean that Barrett owned a record by Pink Anderson and another by Floyd Council, and perhaps he saw the sleeves side-by-side and had a flash of inspiration. Others suppose that both Anderson and Council appeared on a blues compilation album in Barrett's collection. A few even wishfully believe that Anderson and Council made a recording together.   Fact: There is no known recording of Floyd Council and Pink Anderson together. Fact: There is no solid evidence that the two ever played together, or even met. Fact: There is no known blues compilation album that features both of them. Fact: There are no known released recordings (let alone an entire album) under Floyd Council's name (though a few 1937 solo recordings were apparently issued under the name \"Blind Boy Fuller's buddy\"). These facts alone are enough to poke holes in most theories of how Syd came to know these obscure names. But allow me to pose another theory, one with at least a shred of evidence to support it. In 1962, the Philips label released a Blind Boy Fuller compilation called Country Blues, 1935-1940 (BBL-7512). On the sleeve notes, blues historian Paul Oliverwrote \"Curley Weaver and Fred McMullen, (...) Pink Anderson or Floyd Council--these were a few amongst the many blues singers that were to be heard in the rolling hills of the Piedmont, or meandering with the streams through the wooded valleys.\" Finally! The names are side-by-side in print, years before Syd Barrett made them famous in very different circles. Is this the record that was part of Barrett's collection? Was it Paul Oliver who first put the name of Pink Anderson and Floyd Council together? Is it pure luck that Barrett didn't decide to name his band \"Weaver McMullen\", or \"The Curley Fred Sound\"? I believe that it was. And perhaps more importantly, I suspect that Barrett may have never heard the music of Pink Anderson or Floyd Council (unless one of Council's seven recordings with Fuller was included on that compilation). It may well have been the music of Blind Boy Fuller that Barrett found so inspiring. ",

            "answer_text": "The name was created as a combination of the names of two blues musicians: Pink Anderson and Floyd Council. The group first referred to themselves as the Pink Floyd Sound in late 1965. There are disputes as to who created it. Most sources say that Syd Barrett got the idea of the name when he saw that another band were to perform in their show. That band's name was Tea Set. Syd coined the iconic name from the two Blues musicians Pink Anderson and Floyd Council; Syd had their albums in his collection. On the other hand, other sources claim that Stephen Pyle (Syd Barrett's former band-mate) had come up with the name after he saw the names on the liner notes of a popular compilation album by Blind Boy Fuller. These sources also claim that Stephen Pyle considered Pink Floyd for his band before he settled with 'Those Without'. Good for us that he did!  ",
