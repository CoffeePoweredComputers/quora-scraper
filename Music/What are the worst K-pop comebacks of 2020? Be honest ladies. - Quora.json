            "answer_text": "Ok. So what I m gonna state is not actually worst to listen but its a comeback from a certain that I didn't like or wasnt as better than their previous comebacks. BTS ON & BLACK SWAN I didn't like this comeback I actually expected more from them. I didnt like the heavy autotone in their voices and this is one of my least favourite comebacks of them, Boy With Luv was better in my opinion. Dun Dun Dun Everglow This was basically an Adios 2.0. I liked the song but not the line distribution it was way worse than Adios. Mia got all the lines Yiren and Onda were basically only doing background sound effects. The break dance should have been given to EU instead of Mia. ",
