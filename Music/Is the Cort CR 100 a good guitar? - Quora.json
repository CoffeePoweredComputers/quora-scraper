            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve never played one, but it\u2019s probably not bad. It\u2019s a Les Paul style, but has a bolt-on neck. Generally you want a Les Paul to have a set neck, but that\u2019s more expensive to make. The CR200 and CR250 have a set neck, and cost more. I\u2019d pay the extra for that, personally. I would imagine they have nicer pickups as well. Contrary to what another answer says about Cort making bad guitars, Cort is actually a gigantic Korean guitar manufacturing company, similar to Samick, and most of its output has other brand names on it, such as Ibanez, Fender Squire, Parkwood, Hohner, Kramer, and G&L. There are probably other brands as well, but possibly due to non-disclosure agreements, their names are not being referenced. I think it\u2019s possible that you would actually get greater value from a Cort branded guitar. You are saving the additional cost that normally goes into advertising and marketing by buying an essentially \u201cunbranded\u201d guitar, since to my knowledge Cort doesn\u2019t advertise much. I once bought a Cort 12 string guitar, and it was actually great, but I convinced myself that Cort was a crappy brand, so I traded it in for a more expensive Yamaha 12 string. Now THAT guitar was crappy! Bottom line is, I would focus on the guitar itself and whether you personally like the way it plays and sounds. ",

            "answer_text": "Cort is a company centered in South Korea. They make guitars under a lot of different names besides their own. I\u2019ve never played the CR 100 but almost all of these guitars can be made to play pretty well after a set up from a professional guitar tech. The setup will adjust string height about the fret board, intonation of the guitar so it plays in tune as you move up the neck, as well as adjusting the truss rod. Typically one the set up is completed on the Korean made guitar brands they can play quite well. Another common thing to have done with these guitars is fret edge dressing. If you run your hand along the edge of the neck you should not feel the sharp edges of the frets if you do a guitar tech can dress these down to make the guitar more comfortable to play. These guitars are usually shipped with pretty cheap strings, a set up should include a new better set of strings as well. Find out what brand and especially what gauge your tech recommends (usually a light of extra light guage), and replace the strings with the same gauge, a change in string gauge effects the tension on the neck, and this effects the setup so you want to be consistent with the strings you put on.
