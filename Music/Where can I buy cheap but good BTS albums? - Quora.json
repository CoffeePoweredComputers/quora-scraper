            "answer_text": "Always make sure the album you\u2019re buying is an official album so that BTS can actually earn their recognition for it. Places where you can pretty much be 100 percent sure the albums are good are through the BigHit shop or through the Weverse shop. However, sometimes the shipping fees for the Weverse shop to deliver to other countries (such as the US) can literally almost double the price of the product. There\u2019s lots of other places to buy albums though. Target, Walmart, and Amazon are all reliable sellers of BTS albums. But on Amazon, there\u2019s other sellers too, so make sure you buy from the official seller. There\u2019s also some kpop stores that sell official albums, but I\u2019m not too familiar with those.

            "answer_text": "If you want to buy real albums, then you should go to an official website for the album sales which are counted for the Hanteo and the Gaon charts. That helps them win awards and get the recognition they deserved with their hard work. Places like Weverse Shop and BigHit Shop are good choices. But of course, there are fake albums that are made illegally and may cost less. I\u2019m not sure about somewhere with cheap BTS albums. I\u2019d say instead of ordering online, maybe visit a Kpop store where they sell real albums. If you are ordering an album from an official online platform where it is authorized to sell it, then sometimes the shipping fee may cost quite a lot. hope this helped! ~Angela~ ",
