            "answer_text": "I believe RM wrote this song because he was inspired by the similarities between the words \u201clive\u201d and \u201clove\u201d. In English, there\u2019s only a one letter difference. In Korean, \u201cpeople\u201d is \uc2dc\ub78c (salam) while \u201clove\u201d is \uc2dc\ub791 (sarang/salang). In the Love Yourself storyline, RM\u2019s solo corresponds to LY: Her. The song is all about the development of love. There\u2019s amazing meanings behind every lyric, but for the sake of keeping this short, I\u2019ll focus on some of the very literal ones. I\u2019m just a person, person, person You erode all my sharp edges You make me Into love, love, love Take a look at the Korean characters again. See how the characters are exactly the same except for the box in the bottom of the last character for \u201cpeople\u201d vs. the circle in the bottom of the last character for \u201clove\u201d? When RM says \u201cyou erode all my sharp edges\u201d, he means that the box is turning into the circle, changing from just a person into love. You make I to an O I to an O I found out because of you Why \u201cperson\u201d and \u201clove\u201d sound similar\u00b9 You make live to a love Live to a love I found out because of you Why a person must love as they live This is a wordplay on the English words \u201clive\u201d and \u201clove\u201d, since to change \u201clive\u201d into \u201clove\u201d, you just have to change the \u201ci\u201d to an \u201co\u201d. The distance between I and U is far but F*** JKLMNOPQRST This is really interesting to me because he illustrates the distance between himself and the person he\u2019s talking to using the alphabet, which I thought was super cool. Hope this helps! ",
