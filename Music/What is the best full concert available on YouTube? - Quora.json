I don\u2019t even know which ones I\u2019ve seen, either in person or recorded, I might find if I were to go looking today. I am even less sure the scope of concerts that I\u2019d absolutely love were I to see them. So, I can hardly answer definitively. This is Nirvana at the OK Hotel in Seattle. This would be an historic performance if it weren\u2019t the first live performance of \u201cSmells Like Teen Spirit\u201d, but it is also that.  ",
