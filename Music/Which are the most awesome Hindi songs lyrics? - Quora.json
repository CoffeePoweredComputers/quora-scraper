            "answer_text": "There are so many that come to my mind but I would restrict them to the very best I like. Awarapan Banjarapan (Jism) Deep and soulful lines by Sayeed Qadri. You got to feel it right there, seene me. My favourite linesKhanjar se haatho pe lakeerein kaun bhala hai likh paya, humne magar is paagalpan me yeh bhi saha hai seene me.(No one, as yet, has been able to forge the fortune lines in the palm[using an instrument], but our obsession has led us to try it out even in the chest)   Phir Haath me Sharaab hai (Pankaj Udhas) My favourite linesHaatho me ek jaam hai, hothon pe ek ghazal baki khayalo khwab hai sach bolta hun main(I am holding a peg in my hand, and singing a ghazal, the rest is all a dream) The lyrics actually make more sense if you watch the complete video and the context.   Kahin door jab din dhal jaye (Anand) An emotional song and an equally emotional movie. My favourite lineskabhi yunhin jab huyi bojhal saansen, bhar aayi baithe baithe jab yuhin aankhen, tabhi machal ke pyaar se chal ke chhuye koyi mujhe par nazar na aaye(At times when the breathe turns heavy and the eyes turn wet, that very moment somebody unseen walks up and touches me)    Sandese aate hain (Border) A very beautiful song, spelling the emotion of patriotism, love and sacrifice at the same time. A gem of all time from the pen of Javed Akhtar. My favourite linesAye gujarne wali hawa bata mera itna kaam karegi kya mere gaanv ja mere dost ko mera payam de. Vahin thodi door hai ghar mera, mere ghar me hai meri boodhi maa, mere maa ke pairo ko chhoo ke tu usey apne bete ka naam de. (Hey, the passing wind go through my village and drop my message to the friend. A little further my old mother rests in my house, touch her feet and tell her it's your son)   Chitthi ayi hai (Naam) A song that would definitely get tears out of the Indians residing abroad. No other than the lyrical heartthrob of 90's Anand Bakshi. My favourite linesIt's really hard to find the best lines from the song. But to quote two, I would put these:Tere bin jab ayi diwali, deep nahi dil jale hain khali. Tere bin jab ayi holi pichkari se chhoti holi(Without you, Diwali burnt hearts instead of lamps and Holi shooted bullets out of pichkari)   The list is endless. I would name a few more without the links and details. 1. Tanhai (Dil Chahta Hai) 2. Ek pyar ka Nagma hai 3. Zindagi ki na toote ladi 4. Pukarta chala hu main5. Maa (Taare Zameen Pe)6. Zindagi ke Safar me(awesomely beautiful)7. Hosh walo ko khabar kya8. Chaudhvin ka chaand............ Excuse me for the poor English translations. Some things are only beautiful as they are. ",
