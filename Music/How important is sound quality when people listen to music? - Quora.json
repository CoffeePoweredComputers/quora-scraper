            "answer_text": "Of course, sound quality is very subjective. For most people, 128 kbps MP3 recordings are adequate, especially when listened to on low quality headphones. However, there *is* a difference between lower bitrate recordings and high-resolution audiophile recordings (e.g. SACD, DVD-Audio, or pristine vinyl), especially listened to on a nice system.  One important quality to a recording that is typically not given enough consideration is imaging. Imaging is essentially a subjective measure of the perceived three-dimensional locations of sound sources (i.e musical instruments or voices). With better recordings on high-end systems, imaging is typically much more defined and individual instruments can seemingly be located aurally in space. This information is typically not as well-defined or is completely lost on lower quality recordings. So two recordings can \"sound\" very similar or identical, but one may seem \"wider\" because of superior imaging while another may be perceived to have all of the instruments are concentrated in one spot (i.e. the center of two speakers). Another consideration that is not given enough weight is the acoustical quality of the listening space. The best hifi system with the most amazing speakers will underperform in a poor acoustical space. Room geometry, speaker placement, and absorption are all important factors. One mistake that is made all too often is placing speakers too close to a wall. Because of the Haas Effect (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haas_effect), speakers too close to a wall may result in music that sounds poor and muddy. This is due to the way the human brain processes sound, which causes earlier reflections to be combined with the direct or original sound. A simple rule of thumb: place speakers at least 1 meter from any wall. ",

            "answer_text": "I like high-fidelity sound being played over classy speakers. But it's not high on my list of priorities. I find that if I'm comfortably settled on the couch or the floor, I'd rather listen from my laptop or iPad speakers than cross the room to hook up the real speakers. And I certainly don't see the need to spend money on anything more powerful than a pretty modest little pair of speakers anyway. When you listen to music, your imagination does most of the heavy lifting; laptop speakers don't diminish the emotional power of really good music that much, even though you might lose some nuances.  It's a different story if I'm recording or mixing something. Then I bust out the really high-end headphones and focus deeply. Even then, though, I listen to mixes on laptop speakers, knowing that a) many people will experience them that way and b) a really rock solid mix should sound fine even in suboptimal listening conditions. Update: I'm currently taking a class in recording techniques with Paul Geluso, a top-shelf engineer. This guy works all day in a multi-million-dollar studio with top of the line consoles, speakers, mics, preamps, room treatment, the works. And yet, even he enjoys listening to music from his iPhone speakers. He actually mounts his phone on the radar detector thing in his car so he can listen while he drives. He prefers big fancy speakers when they're an option, but like me, he cares more about the content of the music than its presentation. ",
