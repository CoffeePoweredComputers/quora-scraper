            "answer_text": "As stated in other answers, he did for a while. He used an ES-335. But the main reason he didn't play Gibsons, and instead played his own guitar, is because his Frankenstrat is A) designed to hold his cigarette  (Cigarette holder>sick tones any day) And b), the Frankenstrat was designed to be Ed's perfect guitar. It had the light, convenient and iconic shape of a Fender Stratocaster, combined with the thick, hum-free and warm tone of a Gibson guitar. So there was no need for one, because it was basically a Gibson without the back problems. ",
