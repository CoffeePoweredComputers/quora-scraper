            "answer_text": "It\u2019s actually really easy. Most rock, pop and dance songs are written in 4/4 time, with the drums usually on the beat. Move your feet in time with the beat. Congratulations, you are dancing. Yes, it\u2019s that easy. Granted, there\u2019s plenty of rock that\u2019s fairly plodding and slow tempo wise, not exactly what we\u2019d call a ballad, but not fast enough that we could effectively dance to it. I remember well in 1984 going to a high school dance and Judas Priest\u2019s \u201cSome Heads are Gonna\u2019 Roll\u201d was played. What did we do? We slow danced to it. Seriously. It was kind of awesome, to be honest :). For the fun of it, let me show you two songs that were, at the time, considered very different, from very different genres. One was played on heavy metal radio stations. Judas Priest - Painkiller  The other was played in sweaty dance clubs. KMFDM - Flesh  Is there really a difference? Well, at the drum and beat level, no. Collectively, culturally, the first one tells you that you don\u2019t dance to this. The second one, mainly because KMFDM is considered an industrial band, dancing to it is totally normal. My point is you can dance to both of them. It\u2019s not too hard. ",

            "answer_text": "I think Rock music isn't exactly for dancing. Actually, it depends on your definition of \"dance\". Dance is for me a body expression, anything expressed in rythmed or sublime moves and coreography.When in the dance floor in a Rock party or pub, the peoples uses to shake themselves as much as they feel excited by the music, so it's common to see people jumping or shaking their heads a crazy way.I think Rock is for a really free expression, same reason as black is so common in this range (but that's another issue). So, you can stay against the wall just moving your feet, stomping in the music rythm, as you can also jump and shake as the most crazy guy/girl in the party along the dance floor. I use to do the first listening The Doors and the 2nd listening Avenged Sevenfold or Metallica hahaha ",
