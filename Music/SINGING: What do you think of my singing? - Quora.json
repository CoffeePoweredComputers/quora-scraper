            "answer_text": "Hey, man. Just listened to your piece and it's honestly a great start for someone only 5 months in. I'm not going to give you a score because I don't think that it's right to judge based on my preconceived notions of what is a good rendition of the song you chose.  However, I do have a few tips for you to feel out your voice some more: Start out slow. Whenever you learn a new piece, make sure you really understand the melody line and practice at a slower pace. This will give you the opportunity to produce each note as is and really get comfortable with them. I felt you might have been rushing a little or got used to practicing at the usual pace of the song or faster. Start slow and speed up once you've familiarized yourself with the notes.Practice without vibrato first. Make sure you're able to produce a clear sound for each note, especially the lower and higher notes in the range, before you focus on vibrato. Vibrato comes naturally when you supply your voice with enough breath, so there should be no reason to artificially create the vibrato. Exercising this technique will also allow you focus on your breathing technique, which always comes first.Stand properly and take deep & relaxed breaths. Humans have a tendency to manifest their mental attitude in physical behaviors. If you're rushing through the music with too much anxiousness, your body is going to tighten, reducing air volume and consistency in the breath. Make sure that you're in a relaxed yet confident posture when you prep for singing, and consciously remind yourself throughout the song. Don't let a high note dramatically affect your posture or breath. Practice consistent and relaxed breathing (there should be little to no sound when you inhale) and maintain a good posture throughout (shoulders straight and chest perpendicular to the floor).Start out with these few things in mind and see how it goes. Feel free to message me if you'd like more tips on other things, but I'm a big advocate of focusing only on one or two things at once. Also, I think you're doing fine on the emotion part, and you have a great voice. Keep it up! ",

            "answer_text": "First, singing without accompaniment, you maintained pitch.  So you have a good ear and enough skill to use it.  Your natural voice is a little raw and inconsistent, that is the overtones vary, especially on longer notes.  There are two things to improve that.  One, take voice lessons, learn breath control to support your tone.  Two, sing, sing, sing.  All the time. Practice by singing just one long tone and try to maintain the same quality.  Breathe from your diaphragm, putting a hand on your lower belly to make sure the breath is coming from there.  Join a choir and learn how to blend your voice with others, which will take some edge off (inconsistent overtones are what make you edgy).   That said, a lot of singers, particularly folk/country/rock, use an edge to give them a distinct sound, so it's not necessarily a bad thing, particularly if you use it on the right songs.  (The one you chose is a ballad, which is tougher.)  Think Rod Stewart or Rick Danko with The Band (you can tell how old I am).  Overall, I think you have a good start and are already better than average.  With more practice (suggestion 2), you should end up with a good singing voice. One more thing.  Before performing, singers always warm up.  There are standard forms of doing that, singing scales, la la la la, starting with a low note and sweeping up to a high one, doing arpeggios, like the notes of a chord, up and down.  At least one-two minutes before you begin recording.  Choral conductors usually warm up their singers before practice. ",
