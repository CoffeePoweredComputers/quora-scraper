The truth is that fans stream multiple times. Just download an auto replay extension and you can listen while doing anything. Some mv\u2019s I\u2019ve played more than 1000 times. Some more devoted Blinks have multiple computers streaming at 2x speed. They don\u2019t even listen but they keep the computers on day and night just streaming every single one of Blackpink\u2019s music videos. There are fans like this in every fandom. ",
