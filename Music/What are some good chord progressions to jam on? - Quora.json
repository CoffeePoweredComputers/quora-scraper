            "answer_text": "There are thousands of good ones. I always think it is important to learn broader patterns (like cadences, substitutions, common reharmonizations, \u2026) in order to \u201cgeneralize\u201d chord progressions. This way you will have a wider array of progressions ready when you need them. Think of all the variations of a ii-V-I progression. I often start a jam on a I-vi-ii-V progression. Then I add substitutions and other patterns. One such pattern I like is the backdoor progression:  This turns the I-vi-ii-V into a I-vi-iv-bVII. Now you can alternate between these two versions while jamming and already have some variety. ",

            "answer_text": "The 12-bar blues is obvious, but also there are certain songs that have been used as the basis of contrafacts time and time again. Knowing how to play over them will prove immensely helpful. These would include I Got Rhythm and Cherokee. If you work up those two, you gain about 50 other songs at the same time. Others might include All the Things You Are, Back Home Again in Indiana, and How High the Moon. Also a i-V7-V7-i or i-III-iv-V7 pattern is used extensively in Latin music, as well as extended riffing on a single dominant 7th chord (Ran Kan Kan, Anabacoa, Fuego A La Jicotea).  ",
