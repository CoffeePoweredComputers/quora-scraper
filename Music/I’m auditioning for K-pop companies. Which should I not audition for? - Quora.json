            "answer_text": "FIRST OF ALL, DON\u2019T AUDITION FOR A COMPANY WHICH IS NOT THAT BIG. Not necessarily Big 3 type of fame, but maybe WM, FNC, Jellyfish or something like those. Small companies tend to ask for payment with every lessons you get (vocal, dance, etc.) And if you sadly did\u2019nt debut then you will be left with nothing but debt. I've been auditioning for atleast 3 years and got admitted with SME and JYPE but it did\u2019nt go that well. Im currently a trainee from a not that big but still well-known agency. And from what I've experienced, JYPE cares best for the trainees well being. Though they might be strict on diet when you have the chance to debut. If you're a girl this could be a good company for you. They have equal treatment for girl and boy groups especially if you're doing well (like Twice). I don't recommend SME if you're a girl. Even if you debut, you wont be promoted well. And as a former trainee, the longetivity of you being their trainee does\u2019nt guarantee a debut. There are some instances where a 2 year old trainee would be pick to be in the debuting team than someone who trained longer. Also looks ARE A MUST. They are one of the most superficial company where looks is a big factor of being admitted. If you have the Korean Beauty like Taeyeon and Irene it would be easier for you. Keep in mind that Seulgi of Red Velvet is their first female idol with monolid eyes, and thats from a 25 year old ent company. ",
