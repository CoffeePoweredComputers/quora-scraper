            "answer_text": "The best \u201csounding\u201d turntable has NO \u201csound\u201d at all. Turntables are better compared by their functional characteristics; the smoothness of the rotation, no added effects (wow and flutter), no hum, and a frictionless tone arm that holds the cartridge in exactly the right place and attitude for it to do its job i.e. read the analog information in the groove. With all due respect, I have serious doubts re any claims that one mucho$$$ turntable \u201csounds better\u201d than another; I doubt the claim would withstand serious testing and analysis. Surely any one of them will play the record perfectly. Choose the one that offers the best functional characteristic (ease of use) and the most useful features for you at the lowest cost. Beyond that, its up to you to decide how much style and bragging rights are worth to you. ",

            "answer_text": "Turntables only make noise & don\u2019t make audio signals! Cartridge and tonearm make FAR more difference in audio quality & accuracy than the turntable. Once you achieve rotational speed accuracy [solved 35\u201340 years ago to 0.01% rpm] & rumble/vibration isolation of platter [well under 75dB SNR], only the cartridge matters for musical quality. Tonearm design, materials, bearing, geometry all affect how well the record is tracked AND amount of wear on the vinyl, but not much difference in sound. If the turntable unit under consideration doesn\u2019t even mention the cartridge brand & model, forget it! Good turntable manufacturers partner with good phono cart mfrs or will come w/o so you can choose yourself. For best phono cartridges, stick w/ reputable specialist brands like Shure, Ortofon, Grado, Audio-Technica, Denon, Sumiko. Moving Coil designs are generally best performance, but are very fragile, much more expensive & sometimes require add\u2019l. amplification before input to receiver/amp. Vast majority of people are fine with Moving Magnet designs. A word of warning: precise, proper mounting & alignment of cartridge, head shell & tonearm are Critical to audio performance & longevity of both the cartridge AND the vinyl! ",
