            "answer_text": "This joke was/is a bait and switch meme http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme started in the early 2000's by someone or a group of someones who provided links to seemingly relevant topics at hand, but actually led to Astley's video of Never Gonna Give You Up.. Rickrolling, as it became called, was pushed viral when YouTube, as an April Fools day prank in 2008, linked all its featured front page videos for the entire day to the song. In just a couple of weeks, about 13 million people were  rickrolled, The reason the song was chosen isn't known except to those who originally started the meme. But the video, with Ashley and all the others in constant motion, lends itself to ridicule. I'm sure many of those rolled were surprised, just as Liz Pullen says, at who that booming voice was coming out of.  ",
