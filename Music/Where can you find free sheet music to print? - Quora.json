            "answer_text": "I hope your question is \u201cWhere can I find a source of free sheet music to print\u201d and not \u201cWhere can I find a printer to use for free.\u201d I will answer the first question. You can try World Free Sheet Music (PDF, MIDI, MP3) but you might find it frustrating because they mix in ones you have to pay for, and a lot of the free ones are unvetted. Sheet music | Musescore.com also has free sheet music you can download and print but again it is unvetted so there is no quality control. And of course I hope you can use Google as well as I can to find others. There are plenty of excellent versions of public domain music kicking around, but you may have to dig a bit to find them. As for current copyrighted music or the latest hits, generally what you find free on them is more rubbishy if you want to play it as is. If you are an arranger like I am, you can sometimes save yourself a little time by grabbing a free xml file, deleting everything but the melody and simply using that as a frame to hang your arrangement on. But like every thing in life, you pretty much get what you pay for. If you just want to get nicely arranged music to play and you value your time, just bite the bullet and pay $3 or $4 per song from Sheet Music Downloads at Musicnotes.com or Over 1,000,000 Print & Digital Sheet Music Titles. It will save you hours of wallowing around in garbage-y free music on the internets. ",
