            "answer_text": "Its one of those problems faced by most of the people.. One of the main reasons people face this is shortage of practice. It occurs when our larynx loses its capacity to touch the extreme notes of music. Some people damage their own voice by not practicing properly, It can be a temporary problem which will vanish after some days of practice, but it can also be one of the permanent issues. But the one who regularly practice will not get it permanently. The best way to fix these problems is to just relax your throat. It occurs mainly because of absence of practice, but you cannot heal it with giving more strain to your throat. Just relax your throat for minimum a week, go for some healing remedies like:- Gargle regularly before going to bed with some warm water.(best with some added salt)Juice of ginger with some honey.Black pepper with salt.These are some of the remedies you can always go for. And surely it will result for a better voice. :) ",
