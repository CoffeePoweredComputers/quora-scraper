            "answer_text": "The four main saxophones (soprano, alto, tenor, and baritone) can be grouped into two different keys, soprano and tenor are in the key of B flat, and alto and baritone are in the key of E flat. The reason for this is due to concert pitched instruments like piano or guitar. If you were to play a middle C on a piano and then play a C on your sax you\u2019ll get two different pitches. Thus when transposed you\u2019ll get a concert B flat from a sop or tenor, and a concert E flat from an alto or baritone. The reason that composers transpose music for such instruments is that it makes it easier for playing instruments within the same family. As you move down the saxophones from smallest to biggest they get progressively lower in pitch by fixed intervals. If you play a G on a soprano it\u2019s the same as a C on alto which is the same a G on tenor etc. By having the same fingering for each instrument it means that you can play any of the instruments and still be able to read the sheet music for them if you need to switch from one to the other. If you want to play music written in concert pitch you\u2019ll need to transpose up a tone for B flat instruments and for E flat instruments down a minor third. If I didn\u2019t answer well do tell me and I\u2019ll try to make it more clear :) ",

            "answer_text": "Any object can have a natural frequency at which it resonates. The length, shape and material of the tube (that\u2019s basically what a sax is) determines its natural resonant frequency. You can see that a tenor is larger than an alto and is lower pitched. The transposition thing: different saxes, e.g. Tenor, soprano, alto all have basically the same fingering to produce a scale. Because of the intentional size difference, the range of each sax differs and the pitch at a given fingering varies from one sax to another. The lowest note on the tenor sax is, nominally, a b-flat. This note is the same as an a-flat on the piano. The lowest note on an alto sax is also nominally b-flat, but, in actuality is a d-flat on the piano. This scheme has the advantage that saxophone fingerings are \u201c\"the same\u201d across different saxes; a given fingering produces a \u201cG\u201d on all saxes. The reason for this convention is that sax players learn the notes on a sax, and the notes have the same name across all saxes. This saves the sax player from having to know the \u201ctrue\u201d notes on each sax, and to have different fingering patterns in his memory. It also requires the transposition of concert key music for each instrument \u201c\"of a different key\u201d. I hope that clears it up a bit. It seems a crazy system at first, but if you play multiple saxes, you appreciate the design of the system. If that\u2019s not clear, ask for more detail. ",
