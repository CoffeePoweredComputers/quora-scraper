            "answer_text": "This is a fully opinionated question. The other answer to this question was toxic, since there\u2019s no reason to say that someone has more talent, or that they\u2019re more creative. However, getting back on topic, the answer really depends on who you ask since some people say pop and others say K-Pop. But neither is better, they\u2019re both just a genre of music, which both have some iconic songs. Example, everyone knows Gangnam Style, and everyone knows Bye Bye Bye. So the answer is basically that it depends on who you ask, and their opinion. In my opinion, kpop is better, but for others, it could be pop. ",
