            "answer_text": "A lot of good answers. As a session guitar player, this is what is expected of me: I must read music I must know my chords - and many variant voicings of them I must know my scales and so know how to solo (it\u2019s a given, but hey\u2026) I must be adaptable I must not argue; I can offer suggestions, but if they are nixed, I have to comply with what they want I must be a \u201cquick study\u201d - time is money; if I don\u2019t get it down quickly, I won\u2019t be called back I must be able to mimic most styles - or be able to fake it enough to be convincing A certain degree of improvisational application may occasionally be asked for: \u201cHey, Geoff, do you think you can\u2026?\u201d Because producers get ideas that aren\u2019t written down. So\u2026 I must be able to grasp a producer\u2019s thoughts, even if poorly articulated to me, and create something close to what he\u2019s after (Tommy Tedesco tells a hilarious story about the time he was asked to play a Classical passage\u2026) Most of all, I must understand my role as a studio musician. I am hired because I am good at what I do; I make no bones about what I cannot do - yet I will always strive to deliver exactly what the producer wants and requires or needs, and do so with a professional, yet genial, attitude of co operation and intent to make the music sound amazing, to help whatever artist\u2019s work it is seem like it is the best ever produced. Most producers know what my forte is, my strengths and my weaknesses. I am very good at arranging tunes, I can lead sessions, be a go-between with musicians and producer, and I am versatile in my approach. I am also multi-instrumental, but best on guitar and bass. They know what sessions I will be best suited for, and that I will give 100% and more to everything I commit to doing for them. ",

            "answer_text": "Session musicians are very well trained performers. Is people who knows how to get the work done, and this is achieved by training some skills: They are very proficient at improvising at first sight over chord progressions.They are very good at comping by reading chord charts at first sight.They develop very good hearing skills. They can memorize a melody and they are ready to reproduce it with the guitar in no time.They have very good timing, which leads to playing with very consistent groove.Many of them are very good at sight reading.They handle a wide set of techniques and chops. They are versatile, they can make a funky groove or a heavy metal riff, and they can make it over any chord progression at different speeds and keeping the groove.They know about gear. They understand the producer and they can be proactive in creating the sound that the producer is looking for.They play very clean. No unwanted buzzes.They understand about style and they can replicate it. Usually they have played many covers of different bands and styles during their life, so they understand the subtle things that characterized some iconic moments in the history of rock, pop or jazz.If you already have some of those skills, work on the rest of them and gig a lot. Session musicians are amazing, but they are just humans. Good training and a lot of patience and practice can do wonders. ",
