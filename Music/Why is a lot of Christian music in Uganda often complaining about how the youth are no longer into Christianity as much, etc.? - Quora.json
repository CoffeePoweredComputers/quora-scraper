            "answer_text": "I am no expert with Ugandan Christian music. In fact, I could qualify among the people who know the least about it. So you know this is based on the very little I have heard a few times Much of the gospel music sounds like what the preachers say during their Sunday services. And that is why much of it seems like the same thing - the spread of fear and damnation. This is kinda sad, but you have to understand that most people get converted by the same method of fear (if you do this, you will go to HELL) and their assumption is that it will convert more people. Even with normal social problems, a lot of people would think that praying without follow-up actions will solve all worries. This is why, when someone is worried (genuinely, even) about the ways of the youth, their easiest suggestion is religion. And when that doesn\u2019t work well, then it is as if the younger people are headed straight to hell. The truth of the matter is. people believe in different ways, and some complaints arise from people that want everyone to be like themselves.Some religious leaders (across sects and groups) aren\u2019t exactly doing their work for \u2018God\u2019 but to line their pockets. And some people get repulsed because of that.Young people, anywhere in any time period - have always experimented and at times, the experiment is going to a different church. For whatever reason they have. Most of the people who comment about the un-godly ways of the younger people went to their current church sometime in their own youth. Hypocrisy much? I don\u2019t know.On a non-localized scale. Music is an expression, and whatever someone puts in their music, is how they feel. If someone has 10 songs that are complaining about the same thing, maybe he/she has the wrong crowd or is a chronic complainer who enjoys fault finding. Based on their own experience, they assume that all people are the same as they know. And they are right in their expression, just that what they are saying is right for them and not everyone as they would love to claim. Besides, if everyone has a freedom of choice, why would one complain that the competition is outclassing him/her? Every person has their reasons for religion and the generalization is a way of not dealing with the real issue. It is like a parent who says that all teenagers are MONSTERS because her son/daughter is impossible. Anyways, that is what I honestly think about it ",
