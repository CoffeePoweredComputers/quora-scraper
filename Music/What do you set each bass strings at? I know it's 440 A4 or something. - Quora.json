            "answer_text": "Mr. Blechinger is entirely correct. The reference A for a bass is 55 Hz, not 440. As he states, 440 is a reference pitch. I\u2019ll only add that octaves work by doubling frequency. The 55 Hz A is known as A1, A2 is twice that, at 110 Hz, A3 is twice that, at 220 Hz and A4, the reference A, is twice that, at 440 Hz. As such, the A on a bass is four octaves below the reference A (or one octave below the A on a standard tuned guitar, which is A3). ",

            "answer_text": "A440 is a pitch standard, which is not universally agreed upon, not has it always been the \u201cstandard pitch.\u201d All it means is that the A above middle C on the piano is set to 440 cycles per second (on an oscilloscope). A higher number means more vibrations per second, and a higher sounding pitch. A Bass Guitar (assuming that\u2019s what you mean by \u201cbass\u201d) should have it\u2019s strings tuned to (low to high) E A D and G. The A on this case is several octaves below that A440 pitch, I believe three octaves lower (since the bass sounds an octave lower than written), so in terms of frequencies, that would be 55 cycles per second (or hertz).
