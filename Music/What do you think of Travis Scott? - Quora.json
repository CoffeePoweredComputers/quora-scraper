            "answer_text": "I like his name. A lot of people don't know this but my legal gov name was Travis Scott until I was 8 yrs old. If my mom had not gone to court to legally change my name you would have been asking Travis Scott what he thinks of Travis Scott. Anyways\u2026.I don't think of Travis Scott a whole lot. Seems he was on a roll and then he hooked up with a kardashian and he lost his hunger. Can't blame the guy if you are so lucky as to knock one of the kardashians up you'd lose your hunger for whatever you use to be hungry for. I think he is a talented guy who made some dope songs and then fell off is basically what I think of Travis Scott had he not wifed up a kardashian he wud pry still be making dope music we will never know what to think of Travis Scott now.

            "answer_text": "Hello, there! I got to know about Travis Scott in 2018 by RazzaqTube (apparently he removed the Travis Scott part in his video which I have no clue about why). And I heard Travis singing \u201cButterfly Effect\u201d in the video, and I searched on YouTube \u201cFor this life I cannot change\u201d and found his song \u201cButterfly Effect\u201d. And I kept listening to it because it was so good a song for me. For now, when it was Friday, I've used all my break times in school singing \u201cTravis Scott-Butterfly Effect\u201d. I can never get enough. I have even wrote \u201cXD Travis Scott\u201d on my left arm at Friday. Best day on week. I also like the song \u201cStargazing\u201d. Rolling Travis. Answer from Nick. ",
