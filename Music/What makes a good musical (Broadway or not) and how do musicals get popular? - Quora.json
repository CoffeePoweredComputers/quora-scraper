            "answer_text": "I think there are some critical elements to make musicals successful. A love story. There must be two characters that make the audience want to see get together and live happily ever after.The setting should be interesting, but the show should NOT be about the setting. South Pacific is set in WWII, but is not about WWII. You would not describe West Side Story as being about New York, even though it is set in New York.Songs that are beautiful and catchy, that people will leave the theater humming, with interesting lyrics that are written by someone with talent in writing lyrics. This is an offen overlooked aspect of shows.There are exceptions. Cats has such great tunes that it succeeded despite having no plot or love story. It is a dance review with a cat theme. If you\u2019re Andrew, you can pull that off. I think, however, that his shows with love stories\u2014Aspects of Love, Phantom, etc. are better. And some shows with great music can succeed with only a great plot or strong central character.Shows get popular when people see them and like them. They are \u201ctried out\u201d in small venues, and if audiences are enthusiastic, more money comes in for a bigger tryout. Finally, if lots of money comes in, they make it to Broadway or London.",

As far as popularity, word of mouth, and media; commercial or social, are probably the best indicators if a show will be successful. ",

Showboat \u2026 Oklahoma \u2026 South Pacific \u2026 to name just a few. So \u2026 I\u2019d say it takes one-or-more of the following four things: Three+ great songsOne great song, plus several really good onesOne really-great hit songA memorable lead character (I mean the actor or actress playing it)",
