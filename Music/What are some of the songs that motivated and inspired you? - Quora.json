            "answer_text": "As a board-certified music therapist, I can tell you with absolute certainty that the music you listen to has an undeniable effect on the way you think and feel. Of course, you probably already know that. Listening to music you love elevates your mood and improves your overall quality of life. Duh. But did you know that music can have deeper psychological benefits that can actually improve your ability to cope with adversity, steady your nerves, and move forward with confidence?  Fact: the rhythm is gonna get you. Gloria Estefan surely knew that rhythm is one of the most important properties in music; it can help you feel grounded when you're anxious or disorganized. Even better, through a principle called entrainment, it can actually help you regulate your physical and mental processes and get you into a nice productive groove, both literally and metaphorically.  Here are 10 monster hits from the '80s that hit the ultimate trifecta of lyrics, rhythm, and tone. I dare you to listen to them and not feel pumped and inspired to be your best. Behold the ultimate motivational playlist:  \"Eye of the Tiger\" by Survivor. I'm pretty sure everyone has shadowboxed at least once in front of their mirror to this song. If it hasn't happened yet, you still have a lot of life ahead of you. This song will fortify you with the strength and cunning of a wild jungle cat. Inside your mind. And isn't that all that matters?\"Don't Stop Believin'\" by Journey. This song is a favorite of campaigning politicians for a reason; it has a built-in rallying cry. You stand for something, gosh darn it, and Journey's Steve Perry doesn't want you to forget it. Believe in yourself. Believe in your dreams. Take that midnight train goin' anywhere.\"Livin' on a Prayer\" by Bon Jovi. Here's one for all you entrepreneurs. You're halfway there! You'll make it, I swear.\"The Warrior\" by Patty Smyth with Scandal. This song calls up the powerful archetype of the unbreakable warrior, soldiering through adversity, engaging in a primal struggle for dominance. While Patty is probably talking about a romantic conquest, this archetype is so badass that it's almost impossible not to let this song buoy you through any other insurmountable task you might encounter today.\"Danger Zone\" by Kenny Loggins. There's a reason this song was featured in the movie Top Gun, and it's because it's impossible not to imagine yourself walking in slow motion away from an explosion while it's playing. Be that explosion.\"You're The Best\" by Joe Esposito. Remember the tournament fight scene montage from The Karate Kid? Yes? This song makes me want to crane kick my way to ultimate victory, and then watch The Karate Kid. \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\" by The Eurythmics. Some of them want to use you. Some of them want to be used by you. It doesn't matter; whatever it is, you've got this, and Annie Lennox has your back.\"Working for the Weekend\" by Loverboy. This foot-tapper has an infectious rhythm that will spill over into your professional life and leave your officemates wondering what's gotten into you. Explain that it was Loverboy. They'll understand. And then you'll probably have a dance-off.\"Invincible\" by Pat Benatar. Pat Benatar is the queen of sung melodrama and synthesizer. Not in that order. \"Invincible\" makes you honestly believe she's in a life or death situation that she's trying to sing her way out of, possibly against hostile keytar-wielding enemies. It'll put you in the zone. It'll make you feel...wait for it...invincible.\"Vogue\" by Madonna. Nobody out-divas Madonna. Except you, when you're listening to this song. I know there are chronology purists out there who will remind me that this song was released in 1990, thereby disqualifying it from any essential '80s motivational playlist. I think we can all agree that Madonna isn't playing by anyone's rules, and especially not the rules of this answer. She's Madonna.",

Take To The Sky by Van Canto Faith and creed and my beliefWill make you carry on these wings of trustYou will fly awayJust hold on and you'll succeedRemember you're the (one) oneDay one will speak of youAs the light of day I take to the skyI look back from high aboveI am on targetFor something beyondI take to the skyStill grounded on Mother EarthThankful for strong wings to fly 3.  Violent Revolution by Kreator Society failed to tolerate meAnd I have failed to tolerate societyStill I can't find what you adoreInside I hear the echoes of an inner warNothing can take the horror from meYour sick world the loss of all moralityMy hate has grown as strong as my confusionMy only hope my only solutionis a Violent Revolution 4.

Vanishing Hope by Galneryus  Feeling the unknown forceIt's so marvelousBreaking the darkIt's too early to give upNow the evil is wipedI just feel the dawn is nearFor my right, for my dreamsI don't stop the fight until the end of timeSee the light that's so brightNow the time has come 7. Sign Of Revolution by Galneryus Raising your hand, take hold of the flagEven if I will lose my life, you don't stop your fight Under command, we gather tonightThe faith of the steelWe pray to bring near the new legend Sail away, across the sea of madnessThe hardness of the burning steel is by my sideFollow on the sign 8. A Dark Passage by Blind Guardian Smashed down the lightI will not rest till I'm kingValinor's empty now, allied the elves and men, they shall be damned I smashed down the light and dared ValinorI smashed down the light revenge will be mine Slowly marching on, still we're marching on 9.

            "answer_text": "The song \"Wait\", from the M83's album 'Hurry Up, We're Dreaming'. This song is also featured in the movie 'The Fault In Our Stars'.       Lyrics:  Send your dreams, Where nobody hides. Give your tears, To the tide. No Time ! No Time ! There\u2019s no end, There is no goodbye. Disappear, With the night. No Time ! No Time !  M83's 'Wait' was a request based on director Josh Boone's time with a dying friend. There can be a lot of interpretations to this song. Such as, there comes a point in everyone\u2019s life where we realize that we can\u2019t accomplish everything we want to accomplish. We can\u2019t learn everything we want to learn. We can\u2019t experience everything we want to experience. At first, this realization may bring sadness because we realize that there isn\u2019t enough time to accomplish all that we desire\u2026but we should give our \u201ctears to the tide\u201d. We should not be sad because the song isn\u2019t about not having enough time. This song is about time not existing at all. There is \u201cNo Time\u201d\u2026and realizing that our dreams are bigger than our own life can be revealing because our dreams live on through others. Our dreams are infinite. \u201cThere is no end, there is no goodbye\u2026no time, no time\u201d once again displays the infinite vastness of our being. Our dreams, our being, our legacy is infinite. We live on, our dreams live on, through others.  We all stand on the shoulders of those who came before us. We are the living dreams of those before us, with our own personal twist, and just because you personally don\u2019t finish what you started doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s forgotten. Dreams are infinite and by realizing that they may never be accomplished is both vulnerable, scary, and yet peaceful. ",

            "answer_text": "I have one. It\u2019s the band called Disturbed and the song is \u201cINDESTRUCTIBLE\u201d. Now I\u2019ll share the reason behind why I find this song inspiring. Do you know when we need MOTIVATION? When we want to accomplish our goal or when we are feeling like we are at the bottom/sad/depressed. I had experienced both the things at the same time. I was training in the academy (IMA) for pre-commissioning training. While training I suffered a grave injury in my leg (Achilles Tendon tear). The Pain was excruciating and unbearable. As I discovered that this injury needs decent amount of time to heal, I was in shatters. Due to this reason I had to withdraw from the training, the thing for which I had worked so hard to achieve and since it was my goal to be in the army. Only thing in life for which I genuinely felt that THIS IS MY GOAL and slipping it away from my hand was the most PAINFUL thing ever. Nonetheless, I decided to go with the fate that was written and the facts After few days, I started feeling like Am I the most unfortunate? On one fine day I sat and I started INTROSPECTING that Am I the person who BLAMES?? NO! So far I have been a person who has motivated other to STAND UP and FIGHT and what the hell I\u2019m doing right now then??? I looked for an answer and HERE IT WAS- MUSIC! The key to kick myself out of the depression since I have always been a fan of HEAVY METAL music and used to play as a RHYTHM GUITARIST, I had found my answer. The first song that popped in my head was this DISTURBED - INDESTRUCTIBLE! The reason is here:  Just look at the LYRICS! Though I was not in an actual WAR, the words like TERROR, ENEMY, OPPONENT were addressed to my injury and the DARK, GHASTLY times that I had to go through and aptly the words like INDESTRUCTIBLE, INCORRUPTIBLE, DETERMINATION, INVINCIBLE helped me to be a FIGHTER during my dark times. This song is just a BOOST and though it\u2019s a Heavy Metal song, I\u2019m sure those who will listen to it will just get the BOOST and will RAISE HELL! YEAH!

The beginning lyrics are so relatable, and the upbeat happiness is absolutely contagious. <33 The reminder to not be stuck in a rut of \u2018what-ifs\u2019 is just what I need now and then. Other great inspirational songs of mine include:  \u201cLiving Dangerously\u201d by Dami Im. Not only does the message resonate with me- letting go of everyone\u2019s expectations and being fully \u2018you\u2019- the uplifting chords and upbeat tone are amazing.  \u201cWhat We\u2019re Here For\u201d by The Afters! It\u2019s a helpful reminder of how much influence we have on others around us, and of how we\u2019re not alone in this universe.  \u201cI\u2019ll Save You\u201d by Jordan Sweeto. Among many others, it\u2019s a perfect pick-me-up + inspirational tune. I especially love the theme of trying to pull a loved one out of the darkness- inspires me to try and do the same! In the end, a lot of these are inspirational to me because of personal experience + philosophy. Hopefully though, you\u2019ll leave with insights beyond musical taste! ",

            "answer_text": "The obvious answer is Lose Yourself by Eminem. No one can argue this. Believer by Imagine Dragons is a great song describing how pain and hardship has led to strength and success. Fenn by Tom Rosenthal is a beautiful song telling you to savor the beautiful moments of life. Truce by Twenty One Pilots (and to a lesser extent Guns for Hands) are songs asking people to not commit suicide. They are powerful songs for people dealing with depression or other personal troubles. My personal favorite is Famous Last Words, the closing track of the Black Parade by My Chemical Romance. Through the album, the main character dies, relives painful memories, and sees other recently deceased people. In this song, he promise to do anything in his power to return to life, even walk through hell alone. An song that has inspired many, including the aforementioned Twenty One Pilots, and possibly my favorite song.  ",

Simple put; this is the song with every element required.+2408 Not one of the greatest but simply the greatest even if one includes classical music. Stairway to Heaven - Led Zeppelin  The poetic storytelling nature of Robert Plant's lyrics combined with Jimmy Page's brilliant musical composition places \"Stairway To Heaven\" as the number one rock song of all time. Mr. Page's arrangement of a dramatic crescendo type development with the song passing through stages along the way lend to his (and John Paul Jones) influence by classical music. His guitar solo in this song is one of his greatest played with undeniable passion and ease. \"Stairway To Heaven\" is a legendary song composed and performed by the greatest rock musicians of all time, Led Zeppelin. Imagine - John Lennon  Hey you! It is totally incomprehensible that Bohemian Rhapsody is the first. Imagine is the song of all centuries, Queen and John Lennon aren't competitors because John Lennon is god and Queen is just the queen. So Imagine is the first-it's objective reality Comfortably Numb - Pink Floyd  One of the best Pink Floyd songs, I ve first heard of this song when I watched movie The Wall so as with the other songs on The Wall, \"Comfortably Numb\" tells a segment of the story about Pink, the album's protagonist. This song has to do with Pink's battle to handle the world. The lyrics feature interplay between a doctor treating Pink (verses, sung by Waters) and Pink's thoughts (chorus, sung by Gilmour).

Please don't see just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies  Please see me reaching out for someone I can't see  Take my hand let's see where we wake up tomorrow  Best laid plans sometimes are just a one night stand  I'd be damned Cupid's demanding back his arrow  So let's get drunk on our tears and God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young  It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run  Searching for meaning  But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark? Who are we? Just a speck of dust within the galaxy?  Woe is me, if we're not careful turns into reality  Don't you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow  Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer  Turn the page maybe we'll find a brand new ending  Where we're dancing in our tears and God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young  It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run  Searching for meaning  But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark? I thought I saw you out there crying  I thought I heard you call my name  I thought I heard you out there crying  Just the same God, give us the reason youth is wasted on the young  It's hunting season and this lamb is on the run  Searching for meaning  But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?

            "answer_text": "The best motivational song I've ever heard was a song by a soul singer named James Brown. When I was growing up in the bronx in new york , white kids would spit at me and call me names like , tar baby , nigger, spook. Even the grown up whites treated me nasty, also I wasn't treated much better by the Hispanics. I remember my mother coming home from working in the sweatshops in the garment district, and I asked her why she made me black. I hated being black , I was treated like shit didn't have shit and it didn't seem like things was gonna get better. I guess you can say it didn't look good for the home team, if you get what I'm saying. All of a sudden james brown recorded a song (Say it loud I'm black and I'm proud) I had a new outlook on life from the first time I heard it, and ive never forgotten it,and i never will. I'm not saying that I'm proud just because I'm black. I'm saying I'm proud because I come from a people that's part of the human race that has made great contributions to the human race and who have made the entire world a better place for mankind. No race shd be looked down upon because the colour of their skin. At the end of the day there will be only one race , and if they dare to call themselves part of the human race they will all make great contributions and aspire to make this world a better place. ",
