            "answer_text": "The Fm (F minor) chord showing up in a C major progression is a result of modal mixture. That\u2019s when you take a chord from a different mode (i.e. minor (also known as aeolian), dorian, mixolydian, etc) and substitute it into the original mode of the song. So, if you take the chords of a major scale and then the minor scale: Maj: I ii iii IV V vi vii\u00ba (Cmaj Dmin Emin Fmaj Gmaj Amin Bdim) Min: i ii\u00ba bIII iv v bVI bVII (Cmin Ddim Emaj Fmin Gmin Amaj Bmaj) So if we\u2019re in major, we can play around with taking some chords from minor. The progression you gave takes something that would\u2019ve been F F C (F repeated for clarity) which is all in major, and then trades one iteration of the IV chord for the minor version, making it F Fm C (IV, iv, I). There are other really common ones between minor and major, and I\u2019ll write some of my favorites in the key of C for clarity C Dm7 G7 C \u2192 C Ddim7 G7 C (I ii7 V7 I \u2192 I ii\u00ba7(or halfDim) V7 I) C G Am \u2192 C G Ab (or rather, Abmaj9#11 if you\u2019re into the jazzy shtuff like me) (I V vi \u2192 I V bVI) Phewf! Get all that? Just a little tidbit more. There are 5 other modes you can use to switch out chords. I won\u2019t delve into all of them, but my favorite example is probably from the Phrygian mode\u2026.the bII chooorrddddd wwooooooo Maj: I ii iii IV V vi vii\u00ba (Cmaj Dmin Emin Fmaj Gmaj Amin Bdim) Phr: i bII III iv v\u00ba VI vii (Cmin Ddim Emaj Fmin Gmin Amaj Bmaj) C Dm7 \u2192 C Dbmaj7 :) Plenty of other resources out there if you\u2019re interested in learning more in this realm!

            "answer_text": "This chord sequence minus the Cmaj7 is a common turnaround progression in twelve-bar blues. In jazz, you can keep the Cmaj7, but you\u2019ve got to time at least one of your changes between the beats, or you are going to end the progression on an up beat, which won\u2019t sound right, because you want to hit that last chord on a down beat to signal finality. The turnaround works because you have a descending chromatic walking line. The C note in the C chord walks to the B note in the Cmaj7 chord, which walks to the Bb note in the C7 chord, which walks to the A note in the F chord, which walks to the Ab note in the Fm Chord, which finally walks to the G note of the C chord. Now to answer your question, that Fm chord is merely the minor subdominant chord in the C major scale. In the key of C major, blues and jazz artists would mix in notes of the parallel C minor scale and call them blue notes. That Ab in the Fm chord is the sixth note in the C minor scale. This added chromaticity (coloring) adds a distinctive spice to the notes, but as Duke Ellington once said, \u201cIt don\u2019t mean a thing if it ain\u2019t got that swing.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting question. If you look at what you've got there, you will find it's produced by a descending chromatic line from C to G. The CM7 really has no existence, just the C7 to F. Likewise the Fm. It sounds nice because it is a substitute for a dominant 7 b9 \u2026. G7b9, which makes theoretical sense. These kinds of progressions are best suited for ending a song. If you're making them the main body, it's probably a lousy song. ",
