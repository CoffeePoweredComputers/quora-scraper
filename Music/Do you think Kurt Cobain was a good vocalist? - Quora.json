            "answer_text": "I respectfully disagree with most of the people on this thread. I think Kurt Cobain was an amazing vocalist. I think traditionally when we say that word we often times measure it with power and how high a singer can go in their range but not the power and emotion vocals can carry. I\u2019ve seen a bunch of covers for smells like teen spirit and lithium and not one blew me away. I think Kurt\u2019s vocals was incredible because not only did anyone else sound like him but the type of power, anguish and haunting melodic sirens can\u2019t ever be emulated. I often think sometimes we\u2019ve grown accustomed to vocals that sound too perfect or too good when it\u2019s been synthesized cause that\u2019s how we\u2019ve been trained to hear them. But I think Kurt was an incredible vocalist and his voice alone United a generation. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think he was a remarkable vocalist, but he achieved what he set out to do. He was able to convey the content of his songs by singing them in a legible manner. There are many singers who stumble with that, I\u2019m not sure Kurt ever had any vocal lessons? In answer to your question yeah he was an alright vocalist. There are probably several thousand folks singing in bars across the world who are at least Kurt\u2019s equal in vocals. Someone should be asking about them, as Kurt will sing no more. No disrespect toward Kurt or his fans, but he\u2019s been dead for close to 25 years now, what about the live ones singing with relevance? Just my thoughts. Thanks! Robert ",

The songs were written by him, for his poor tortured soul to chew on and spit out at the world. Kurt poured his heart into those songs, and sang about the life and times of chasing the high, as well as the low. Like a character in a Ginsberg novel. Fair Accompli.. ",
