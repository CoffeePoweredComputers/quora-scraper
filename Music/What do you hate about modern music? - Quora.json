But y\u2019all are making yourselves into something that gen z has been mocking for years now. And hey, if you wrote a rational, calm, answer, congratulations! This isn\u2019t meant towards you. So, onto who was meant towards: And are you capable of writing an answer without being nasty towards female artists that are *gasp* sexually promiscuous? The slut-shaming seems to be very one sided here\u2026 We get it. You probably listen to cool underground vintage bands that this dumb generation has probably never heard of, like Queen or Nirvana. You either miss the way the eighties were or you were \u201cborn in the wrong generation\u201d. Look, lots of people like to reminisce about times past, and there are certainly tons of things to miss about the eighties: music, movies, celebrities, fun hair, mom jeans, scrunchies, the AIDS epidemic, artists like ACDC, Michael Jackson, Van Halen, the increasing racial discrimination during the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, Ronald Reagan, Baywatch, Michael Jordan. And I am LAUGHING out loud for the first time ever because of Quora answers. You can criticize people ALL day long and think whatever decade of music was better- sixties, seventies ,eighties, nineties. But holy crap y\u2019all are sour! Even with such a charged question! Oh, the humanity! A lot of these answers seem fueled by vitriol of everything modern and mainstream, especially when it pertains to women & expressing their sexuality. Sorry, but is what y\u2019all look like. The memes write themselves.    Caroline on TikTok Ben Ulmer on TikTok and yes, I put tiktoks as examples. Cry.   congratulations, you played yourself.  EDIT** Ladies and gentlemen, we are at 200 upvotes and about thirty comments, so if you\u2019re wondering what being famous is like, just ask me. And I mean\u2026I was a\u2026tiny bit\u2026snarky\u2026in the answer. Just a little. Certainly not wound up from all the other answers at all. Reading this answer makes me realize I have become the very thing I swore to destroy: overly salty answers. It was rather cathartic. However, when asked to pick between my newfound fame and my moral code, fame wins out by a large margin. So I\u2019ve decided to let the answer remain in all it\u2019s divisive glory. EDIT 2** I cropped the name off, but if you find this answer please don\u2019t harass! I really only included this because it is exactly the type of response or mindset that I wrote about. (this is not intended to bully anyone. I just think it\u2019s a really weird coincidence) Let\u2019s just play a \u201cspot the difference\u201d game between the first image I\u2019ve posted and this answer.   Now look at the first image I posted on this answer. Corporate wants you to find the difference between the two pictures. They\u2019re the same picture. ",

            "answer_text": "There are multiple things I hate about modern music, so I am just gonna split this answer into multiple sections. As this answer would get too long otherwise, I am solely going to concentrate on today\u2019s pop music (which undoubtedly is the genre with the most problems in today\u2019s times). (Most) modern music lacks individuality Especially while listening to today\u2019s pop music, I always hear the same instrumentals, the same voices, the same theme. Individuality is important to me when it comes to music, because music should be used to express yourself, but today\u2019s music industry doesn\u2019t care about all that. It\u2019s just about the money you can make with a specific artist, that\u2019s why there are literally no differences in lyrics. Let\u2019s be honest here, most popular music of today has one of the following themes: LoveBreak-upSexDrugsHeartbreakIt feels like people nowadays only think about these things, when there\u2019s so much more you could express in music. Hell, lyrics aren\u2019t even really necessary to make great music. I love to listen to some instrumental music, especially piano music. Overrated artists Another one of my personal pet peeves about modern music is that many of these \u201cartists\u201d, are completely overrated and get all the hype without being any better than others. You can tell me what you want but this girl:  doesn\u2019t have anything about her that differentiates her from other pop artists besides being edgier than average. Obviously, I don\u2019t personally know her, she might be a great person, but her music just feels\u2026bland. And I really don\u2019t like her way of singing. I didn\u2019t listen to all of her songs (simply because the genre in itself doesn\u2019t interest me), but her voice in \u201cbad guys\u201d was just really off-putting to me. She sounded like she was on drugs or just really tired while singing. I know that that\u2019s probably intended, but it doesn\u2019t make it any better. I am not saying she doesn\u2019t have talent, because she definitely has potential, but the way she presents her music just isn\u2019t my cup of tea at all. She obviously tries to be different than other artists, but makes a fool out of herself while at it. And Billie Eilish is only one example of many. I can\u2019t stand most pop artists, but it all comes down to the themes of their songs, the way they sing or how they present themselves. Most of them aren\u2019t that talented to justify the hype. Song writers get almost no recognition at all There\u2019s also the problem that many artists of today don\u2019t write their own music, yet they still earn more than many artists that do so. What\u2019s even worse is that they practically get the fame for something another person did. Imagine putting all of your effort into writing a song just so your younger sibling (or a friend, it doesn\u2019t really matter) gets famous for it just because they happen to sing it, while you remain completely unnoticed. I would feel underappreciated and ignored and almost like a \u201cslave\u201d to the singer. I know it\u2019s their job most of the time, and the song writers might not even be bothered, but it\u2019s still a very lame system if you ask me. Profit =/= Effort Another pet peeve of mine is how unfair the whole profit system of modern music is. There was another great answer to this question in which the author criticized how people like Eilish earn more than people who studied years to play in musical orchestras. They undoubtedly put more effort into their work, yet they remained completely unnoticed, while some 17 year old girl just sings something she hasn\u2019t even written completely by herself and gets all the fame and money for it.  So what do I hate about modern music? lacks individuality (same themes, same lyrics, same music all over again)overrated artistsmany singers profit from the creative work of another personpeople that put more effort into their music don\u2019t get as much fame as people who do much less",
