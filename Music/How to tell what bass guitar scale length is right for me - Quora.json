            "answer_text": "If you are an adult, any scale length is good and your choice will be based on your preferences, usually on what model of bass you want to play rather than the scale length. In other words, you pick the scale length the bass model you want comes in. Picking a fanned-fret bass effectively makes this question irrelevant, as it is a multi-scale fretboard. If you\u2019re about as small as an average 10 year old Asian kid, a junior sized bass would be good. ",

            "answer_text": "It's nice to have at least two basses. You can't finger a long scale quite as quickly, due to the extra distance between notes. But long bass strings have a great sound. A longer scale is preferable for slower pieces which make up the majority of songs. A very quick piece might be impossible to play without a shorter scale. I have a fretless Ergo bass with full-length doublebass strings and a piezo pickup. It's meant to be played upright, but as it's essentially all neck, I often hold it horizontally while playing. Although I can reach every part of the neck, it isn't necessary to have long arms. One can finger and pluck in the same region. ",

            "answer_text": "I would always recommend playing a long scale if you can manage it for a number of reasons, most of which have been mentioned already. The acid test: if, with the Bass strapped on, you can place your four fingers on the first four frets, on the E string, you should be fine. However, knowing nothing when I started, I bought a second hand short scale semi-acoustic bodied bass and switched to a solid bodied long scale later. As the bass was secondhand, I was able to sell it for what I paid for it - so that might be the way to go !. ",

            "answer_text": "Try a couple of different scale lenghts, then buy a good second hand bass with the scale lenght you believe to be right. Play a lot. If you feel that it isn\u2019t the right scale sell your bass for about the same price you bought it for and find another good used base with the scale length you now believe to be right. Repeat until satisfied\u2026 Also - unless you\u2019re really short and have small hands you\u2019ll probably be fine with most scale lengths. ",

            "answer_text": "It all depends on your size. If you are petite, a short scale bass (30\u2033) is smaller, lighter, and will not require extending your arms to much. If you are average sized go for a regular scale bass (34\u2033). These are suggestions. Tal Wikenfield and Esperanza Spalding are both petite and use regular scale basses with no problems at all. ",
