            "answer_text": "From my perspective as a local High School band member of the 60\u2019s. The 50\u2019s gave birth to the 60\u2019s. Doo Wap was the real beginning of 50\u2019s Rock and Roll. It was the bridge between the music of the 40\u2019s to the music of the 60\u2019s. As such the 50\u2019s rock music was trying to come of age, but didn't become so until the middle of the 60\u2019s when it was finally a genre\u2019 of its own. It paved the way for the Beatles, Rolling Stones, The Who etc. So think of the 50\u2019s as the Doo wap era with a mix of classic country with stand up base, steel guitars and fiddles. There were still crooners like Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Bobby Vinton, Nat King Cole etc. The 60\u2019s was pretty much electric guitars, electric base, keyboards. But there was also the Folk music and ballads that also marked the era. There was a complete break from the traditional look of clean cut hair, ties and jackets to whatever made them stand out as different by the end of the decade. Hard rock now claiming it\u2019s place in the genre\u2019 along with classic rock. I think both eras had their merits and are very nostalgic for those of us who were coming of age back then. We saw a complete metamorphosis of that scandalous music called Rock and Roll to what if finally became today. ",

            "answer_text": "Answering as a music fan only, the music of the 1950\u2019s was innocent. It was a transition time, from country and the big band era, to doo wop and rockabilly. I personally don\u2019t like too much music from the 50\u2019s, Bobby Darrin is the only artist I really enjoy, and while songs like \u201cAt the Hop\u201d and \u201cDuke Of Earl\u201d have their place in music history, they are not my cup of tea. But the 60\u2019s, man the 60\u2019s. That\u2019s when I was born, and to me, that\u2019s when music was born. The nation was going through turbulent times, with the Vietnam war and racial equality and the music, especially the music of the latter half of the decade, reflected that struggle. \u201cFor What It\u2019s Worth\u201d by Buffalo Springfield, \u201cWar\u201d by Edwin Starr, Peter, Paul and Mary\u2019s \u201cIf I Had a Hammer\u201d and so many more. The music meant something. ",
