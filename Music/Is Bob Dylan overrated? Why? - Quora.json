            "answer_text": "No I don't think he is. And unlike a lot of artists I don't think he's over rated even by his own fans. I consider myself a massive Bob Dylan fan and I have many friends who would make the same claim. But I don't know a single Dylan fan who claim they like all his music. I've heard everything he's done and I can honestly say there are quite a few Dylan albums that I know I never need to hear again. There are Dylan songs that I think are just awful and every Dylan fan I've ever met agrees. The guy was definitely fallible. But is he over rated as a musical influence? Not at all. He's the most important musical figure of the last fifty years and deserves all the accolades he receives. The following is by no means a comprehensive list of his achievements. 1. He popularised folk music. Artists like Pete Seeger had been trying to popularise folk music for years before Dylan came along. They saw songs as the uniting force which would galvanise the civil rights movement and change America. They got through to several on the far left but were generally ignored. When Dylan came along he made folk music marketable and popular. Blowin in the wind was everywhere in the early sixties. It became an anthem. It was easy to sing, easy to play, easy to join in with and was catchy as hell. There are countless musicians who decided to pick up a guitar and say something because they heard Dylan's music. He was a true inspiration. His songs launched entire careers. The Byrds, The Band and Peter Paul and Mary are the most notable artists who originally gained popularity with a Dylan cover but there are many others who rode on his songwriting. The Animals recorded House Of the Rising Sun because they'd heard it on Dylan's first album and Barry McGuire wrote Eve of Destruction in an attempt to be Dylan and have his success. The Beatles and The Rolling Stones have both talked about the huge influence that Dylan's music had on their career with Lennon stating songs like You've got to hide your love away were a direct attempt to write music like Dylan. 2. He released an incredible string of albums in the sixties.  There aren't many artists who have had the incredible run of success that Dylan had in the sixties. Most people overlook his debut album (which is mainly covers but still a great listen) and focus on 1963's Freewheelin Bob Dylan, 1964's The times they are a Changing and Another Side of Bob Dylan, 1965's Bringing it all Back Home and Highway 61 Revisited, 1966's Blonde on Blonde, 1967's John Wesley Harding and 1969's Nashville Skyline. It's an amazing string of 8 classic albums that between them contain enough hit songs to cement his reputation as one of the greatest songwriters to ever live. Amazing lyrics, incredible performances and outstanding songs and a legacy that nobody has managed to touch. 3. He helped invent psychedelic rock. When Dylan went electric he scandalised the folk movement, horrified a lot of his fans and made music that changed the world. He moved from folk to rock and mastered it in an instant. When Rolling Stone magazine listed the greatest 500 songs of all time, Like a Rollin Stone came in at number one. It's the song that destroyed the idea that a single had to be under three minutes in length and that radios wouldn't play any song longer than four minutes. It changed radio formats and had a huge impact on people like Frank Zappa who was blown away when he heard it. Dylan's brief psychedelic period provided anthems for the summer of love, they spoke to hippies even if nobody could really agree on what they were saying. 4. He invented alt-country. When Dylan turned his back on electric music he went country. But not traditional country. He used some of the forms of country music but few of the lyrical tropes. He also added a more complex layer which caused people to claim his music was \"rustic\" not country. In the process he married country music with left-wing progressive ideology. He created hippie country. His country period inspired Gram Parsons and the Band to follow suit. The Grateful Dead, who were notorious for ridiculous ambition in the studio and incredible indulgences onstage, recorded their two best albums as stripped back alt-country affairs thanks to Dylan's influence.  5. He released one of the greatest albums of the seventies. The Beatles broke up, the Stones started to fade but in 1975, Dylan released Blood on the Tracks which is an undisputed masterpiece. Frequently voted the best album of the entire decade, it was an incredible return to form and many people cite it as his best album of all time. The following year's Desire is pretty highly regarded as well.  6. He invented Contemporary Christian Music Okay, you may feel he deserves blame for this rather than credit, but Dylan's brief born again period produced albums that proved there was a huge market for rock that had Christian-friendly lyrics. There had been Christian albums before Dylan converted but he turned it from an underground genre that wasn't even accepted by mainstream Christians into a massive business.  7. He released one of the best albums of the 80's.  Ever heard Oh Mercy? You should. It's brilliant. Bob released it in 1989 after a string of frankly terrible albums and suddenly proved he was capable of great music in a decade that hadn't been kind to music legends. Rolling Stone magazine rates it as the 44th best album of the decade, Q magazine said it was the 33rd best. Personally I think it's in the top ten but either way, it's widely regarded as an overlooked masterpiece.  8. His 30th anniversary proved the huge extent of his influence.  Columbia put on a tribute concert for Dylan on the 30th anniversary of his signing and the list of performing artists proved how far reaching his influence was. Throughout the night members of The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Velvet Underground, Pearl Jam, The Byrds and The Band, were joined by Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, Stevie Wonder, Neil Young and others who all professed the Bobby love. His songs have been covered by Hendrix, Elvis, Guns and Roses and hundreds of others. His influence stretches across pretty much every musical genre. 9. He recorded one of the best albums of the 1990's. In 1997, while a lot of his contemporaries were recording tribute albums to themselves in which they relived their former glory with modern stars, Dylan wrote an album of new material and played it with his travelling band. The result was Time Out of Mind, which won the Grammy award for album of the year in 1998 and makes many critics list of the best albums of the decade. It was 408 on the Rolling Stone list of the best 500 albums of all time. No guest stars. No Blowin in the wind cover. Just new, original music that many rank as among his best ever. 10. His never ending tour continues to produce amazing music. Dylan could make a fortune performing note-perfect renditions of his sixties material to baby boomers who were happy to fork out money just to say they've seen Dylan perform The Times They are a Changin. He said early on that he would never do this and he's stuck to his word. Since 1988 Dylan has been on his Never Ending Tour. He's travelled the world constantly and is almost always on the road performing in big venues for huge crowds. He's performed 1,561 concerts in the US alone and visited dozens of other countries multiple times. His shows are no nostalgia act. He doesn't perform any songs they way they were recorded on the album and he doesn't have a standard setlist. Dylan shows are made up of rearranged versions of songs ranging from his first album to his latest all performed by his tight, talented and incredibly well rehearsed band who are all given a chance to show off their musical ability. The concerts aren't put together for people who know Dylan's music from the radio, they're played for the huge legion of fans who see Dylan whenever he's in town and will often travel to follow him around. Bootleg recordings are traded constantly and shared across the internet for people desperate to hear what he's up to now. 11. He released two of the best albums of the 00's. 1997's Time out of Mind set the blueprint for Dylan's late career renaissance. Original songs played with his touring band and produced by the man himself and then released to huge critical acclaim. 2001's Love and Theft was hailed as the best album of the year by Rolling Stone and Village Voice. Newsweek said it was the second best album of the decade and Entertainment Weekly listed it as one of the decade's best. 2004's Modern Times debuted at number one in the billboard charts, was Rolling Stone magazine's pick for best album of the year and number 8 on their Best of the Decade list and 204 on their best albums of all time list. 2009's Together through life was another number one album and another critical and commercial success. Is Dylan over rated? No. He was, and still is, an incredible talent. His first great album was released in 1963 and his most recent great album was released in 2013. He's one of the few atists of his generation who released classic albums in the 60's and in his 60's. He's put out at least one outstanding album in every one of the last six decades and has a massive catalogue of incredible songs. As I'm typing this, he's in Tokyo where he's performing 6 shows in a big venue for legions of his satisfied fans who are desperately hoping he plays something obscure like \"Man in the long black coat.\" If anything Dylan is under rated by people who think he was just a 60's protest singer who refused to die.

            "answer_text": "No, and let\u2019s emphasize a few things here: He started as a folk musician, but had mapped out plans to convert to electric as early as \u201cThe Freewheelin\u2019 Bob Dylan\u201d (he wanted to record a version of \u2018That\u2019s Alright, Mama\u2019 by Elvis).His music and lyrics first had the sociopolitical themes of the day. However, they were universal in their themes and didn\u2019t skew to one side (although you could probably tell where Dylan stood with regards to civil rights, nuclear war, etc. in those early songs).He pushed the boundaries of the album when others were just starting to release records of all-original material (staring with Highway 61 Revisited and ending with the first double album in rock music, Blonde On Blonde).Rock music was turned into an art form with Blonde On Blonde: that record was the definition of \u201cartistic expression\u201d (surreal lyrics, suites coming in the form of \u201cVisions of Johanna\u201d and \u201cSadeyed Lady of the Low Lands\u201d). Putting that aside, his conversion to electric instruments showed that the electric guitar can be a serious mode of expression and not just a \u2018commercial instrument,\u2019 as his detractors derided him at the time.He was a pioneer of country rock: He turned the music world on its heels in 1965 to 1966\u2026.only to reverse course and release a record (John Wesley Harding) of simpler material that would lay the groundwork for more revolutionary work by bands like The Byrds and The International Submarine Band.",
