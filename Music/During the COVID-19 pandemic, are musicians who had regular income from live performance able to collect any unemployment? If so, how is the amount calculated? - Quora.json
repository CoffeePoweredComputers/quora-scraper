            "answer_text": "One of the tenets is a musician that prior to the CV worked all the time. He is extremely good and very talented; therefore, he worked all the time. Not all musicians can claim that. Musicians have to be killer good AND know people, too. He feels truly happy to be able to support his family on his talent alone. He says that the CV has stopped some of his work that required he perform in front of an audience. He could/can only do certain types of gigs. We have not forced him to pay his rent. He has but we didn't do that. We're not monsters. He payed weekly not monthly. He has a child he must support. We are not responsible for his child, but we understand very well and made arrangements with him. As far as unemployment, there is such a way he can apply and likely get help. It's the Pandemic Unemployment. I know he pays taxes regularly so the IRS can pull his tax records and adjust payments accordingly. Usually, one must stay under a certain type and amount earned to receive help. He's considered a self employed person. He is very quiet about his connections because so many people try to harass him into giving up his managers and agents and fellow musicians names. He'd lose everything if he told others his connections unless the bosses he works for specifically asked him to find a person for them. I see him attend our music functions, festivals and other venues regularly since there is a lot of talent up here, a lot. He can scout for talent for his bosses. This is an area where many people come to hone and try out their talents for a lot of reasons. Some make it and some do not. It helps to have a backer. I am sure he will get some help because he reports his earnings religiously. ",

            "answer_text": "I can give a Canadian answer because I\u2019m Canadian. Wherever you live the rules may be different. For someone to collect unemployment insurance, they have to be registered for it and paying into it. There are other certain conditions, basically requiring that the reason that you don\u2019t have work is not your fault. If you are considered to be an employee (like many members of symphony orchestras) then your taxes are structured like any other employee of any other employer, including unemployment insurance, and you can apply (after a brief delay) and be paid 55% of your previous salary, up to a maximum of $573 per week. Self-employed persons can pay into unemployment insurance; it\u2019s just that not many musicians do. It is also calculated at 55% of your previous salary, up to the same maximum. For persons with varying weekly salary, the calculation is a little more complex, but quite fair. However, the federal government has recently instituted the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. From the government site: \u201cIf you have stopped working because of COVID-19, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) may provide you with temporary income support. The CERB provides $500 a week for up to 16 weeks.\u201d Like unemployment, there are certain restrictions, and earning money other than the CERB reduces the amount you can claim. At first, musicians weren\u2019t allowed under the rules to collect the CERB, but the rules were amended after a couple of weeks because they were unconscionable. ",

            "answer_text": "Most musicians, unless they perform in a symphony orchestra or pay into self-employment insurance themselves, are simply out of luck. Most musicians are considered independent contractors and self-employed. That's one of the great things of being a musician. (not really) When times get bad, live music is the first thing to go. A restaurant needs a dish washer but certainly not a musician. Reality. ",
