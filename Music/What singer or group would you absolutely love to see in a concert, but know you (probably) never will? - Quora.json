Swedish House Mafia.There will be always a missing space in my life, where I will tell myself. I never attended SHM gig!I was not there when Axwell, Steve Angello and Sebastian Ingrosso, altogether dropped beats while I could be singing 'Don't worry child... See Heaven's got plans for you'My favorite DJ group split up on 2012. Though, they just removed Steve Angello and abolished the name. While other two swedish DJs continued working together under the name Axwell /\\ Ingrosso and I really like their new releases but still it doesn't have that charm like Swedish House Mafia had.   \" They Came, They Raved, We Loved \"Westlife.One of my favorite Pop music band. I was taken away by their album Coast to Coast in 2010, but soon they announced their splitting in 2011.I will always miss them!  ",

            "answer_text": "Pretty much any band I like, but which also has the bad fortune (from my perspective) of being hugely popular. Thing is, I love concerts, but they have to be small to medium sized; there's no band on the planet worth going to a stadium-type concert where you're so far from the stage that they need to put up huge screens so that you'll see what's going on at all for. If I want to watch a band on a screen, I can do that without leaving my living-room thankyouverymuch. Also, bands and artists who are retired, or nearly so; technically you might still be able to go to a Rolling Stones concert (assuming you're fine with it being huge), but practically speaking, you're decades too late for that; and I personally won't bother, not even in the extremely unlikely event that they'd hold a small concert somewhere in my viscinity.

And they taught me that all I need is love. It would have been interesting to see a day in their life. I would be twisting and shouting at their songs. But it's all in yesterday now. Way across the universe it is. So, now I have let it be.But when I'm sixty-four And sitting in my strawberry fields,I'd still be singing their songs eight days a weekBecause In my life, I've loved them all. ",
