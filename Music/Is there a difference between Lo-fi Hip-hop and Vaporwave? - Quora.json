            "answer_text": "Yes. They pull from different samples/themes and they have a very different vibe overall. Artists who do lo-fi come from a different mindset and vaporwave moves toward non sample, nostalgic feel, ambient music (it's not always like that, as there are different sub-genres, like vaportrap). We can say that while lo-fi is organic and always in a happy upbeat, vaporwave focuses on making you feel that comfortable uncomfortableness, feelings that you don't often have, like false nostalgia, etc. We also have to remember that lo-fi hip-hop is a sub-genre of hip-hop, while vapor is it's whole other thing, a genre. Now, even if you listen to vaportrap next to lo-fi, you'll listen how vaportrap sticks to the beat, while lo-fi usually uses off kilter beats. ",
