            "answer_text": "Well I would say to them. Yes, I love those gay. Yes they act like cute and all, wear lipstick and makeup, colour their hair and hug each other. Their are people in my country who calls them girls like \u201c they are boys? They look like alot like girls they r wearing earrings and lipstick\u201d I would tell them earrings r trending in boys, if u r talking about lipstick well they r soo fair so some gloss make them adorable. I think a person who can attract both gender female or male are so good. Few boys can attract only 1 gender or both. But BTS attract their fan by their love for their army , their songs, their personality and their hotness, sexyness, cuteness , handsomness and everything you can talk about them. Btw who has talent to attract both gender and other LGBTQ realated ? (Bts support LGBTQ) I'm fujoshi (who likes gay realated things) Tell them I like those gay guys those are my type. :\u03c0 #happypridemonth #pride #pridemonth #lgbtq #gay \ufe0f\u200d\ufe0f\u200d\ufe0f\u200d\ufe0f\u200d\ufe0f\u200d Thank you ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with everyone else in that politely disagreeing and/or ignoring the question altogether would be wise to avoid confrontation. (Although, it's 2017, Helen; people are gay.) However There is quite a bit of evidence indicating that the boys are somewhere under the LGBTQA+ umbrella. Prime example: Suga Min Yoongi's lyrics in Cypher Pt 3: \"Like you all know, my voice turns people on. Whether it be men or women, my flexible tongue movements will send them to Hong Kong with my raps.\" (Sending people to Hong Kong meaning giving them amazing orgasms)Back during the promotion of Danger, when BTS got asked \u201cWhat do you notice first when you look at girls?\u201d Yoongi\u2019s reply was: \u201cI focus on personality and atmosphere. I don\u2019t have an ideal type and it\u2019s not limited to a girl.\u201dYoongi\u2019s also admitted that, in all honesty, he\u2019s never been in real love before and when he has to write lyrics about romance he\u2019ll go to the other members for advice.Futhermore, the other member\u2019s usage of \u2018unnie\u2019 to other guys can be characterized as a thing in Korea\u2019s gay community. And while on their Wings tour in Newark, a fan said that a friend of theirs had taken a pride flag and that Jungkook (or maybe Namjoon, I would have to find the original post) had seen it, pointed to it, and smiled widely. All of this should be taken with a grain of salt. This is South Korea we're talking about and while there is a growing amount of support and acceptance for queer idols (see: Marshall Bang and Hong Seokcheon), there isn't going to be any coming out statement or explicit boyfriend pictures.

Try being creative and say something new.I love people talk about being open minded but when boybands like this come to the forefront, somehow all their openmindedness flies out of the window. It's as if men won't let those boybands survive because they are not majorly involved in it. And all those girls hating on it to make people think you're cool, edgy and different? Y'all are nothing but sheep-minded people looking for men's approval.When you call kpop men gay and how they look like girls, you're not only being a homophobic but also using women as a derogatory term. I guess your openmindedness just flies up in your a** then.",

No. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being gay and the fact you feel the need to respond proving otherwise shows homophobic behaviour (which you may not be trying to portray but it happens anyways).

At the same time we must understand that certain individuals are entitled to social norms. If a guy wears makeup, it means he's gay, if a guy wear 2 earrings, it means he's gay, if his shorts are above his knees, it means he's gay, plus more. It's all just a form of ignorance. Therefore, I would IGNORE the IGNORance. ",
