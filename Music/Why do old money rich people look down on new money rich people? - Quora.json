            "answer_text": "Those who come from \u201cold money\u201d don\u2019t look down upon the success of the \u201cnew money,\u201d afterall someone in their own family had to have built the fortune they now enjoy, whether it be their parents, grandparents, great grandparents, etc\u2026 What those belonging to old money look down upon is the attitude many of the new money or Noveau riche take toward money. I\u2019m only speaking from anecdote, of course but I\u2019ve seen the differences with my own family as well as many of my friends. My father grew up dirt poor in as a farmer in an underdeveloped country. But my mother was for all intents and purposes \u201cold money.\u201d My father eventually got an education and became a successful surgeon before he married my mother. For my father it was a hard to adjust from being a poor farm kid with one pair of pants to wear everyday for school to having a career where he was making probably 100 or 200 times what his own father was making back on the farm. He even found a lot of success in his own medical practice he started with a good friend from medical school. But almost as soon as my Dad was making money, only the finest would do for him, he bought a new luxury car every year, ate at the finest restaurants, and bought a luxurious home in an upscale neighborhood. His partner did the exact same thing and they always competed to see who could outdo each other when it came to living the high life. I remember when I was a kid we had 7 or 8 cars in the driveway. He looked very silly too, my dad would have to move them all around if he wanted to take a particular car to work. I remember he even used to do something as silly as drive us to school in a different car every day, and on days where he wanted to drive his Mercedes SL, he would make three different trips to drop my brother, my sister and myself off to school. My dad embarrassed my sister most of all, up until she got to high school my dad would drive her to school in the bright red SL stop the car in the school drop off zone in the middle of traffic and walk her up the stairs. He sure as hell pissed off a lot of the other parents, but everyone who got to know him personally always had the utmost respect for him. My mother always kept telling him to live more modestly, that he needed to control his spending. She would always tell him, \u201chaving wings didn\u2019t stop Icarus from falling.\u201d When he first started making a lot of money, my father always bragged about how much money he made and he believed surrounding himself with a large amount of luxuries and the constant need to have others refer to him as \u201cDr.\u201d would be a great way for him to showcase his status. That attitude caused him to develop a superiority complex, he even admitted that having people fawn over his success was a huge ego boost for him. My mother also told me that my father once made her sell her old Volvo because it \u201cwasn\u2019t fit for a doctor\u2019s wife,\u201d whatever that meant. Displaying everything you have for all too see is not only gaudy, but it attracts a lot of unwanted attention and can be dangerous. My father still makes a lot of money, but back in those days he also spent it pretty much as fast as he made it. When the rest of my father\u2019s family made it out to the city, they weren\u2019t as fortunate as he was and they relied on him because he was now the \u201cbig shot\u201d rich Doctor, and how could he say no to family, they\u2019ve been with him supporting him all the way. But a couple hundred dollars in rent turned to buying them cars, co-signing loans, etc\u2026 All of that took a toll on him and it was more than he could handle, he couldn\u2019t take care of all eight of his siblings. One day when he couldn\u2019t give them as much as they wanted, a few of his brothers and sisters began to hate him, even cutting contact with him to this day because he was \u201cstingy,\u201d \u201ccheap,\u201d and claimed he no longer loved them. They believed that his success was \u201ctheir\u201d success and that he owed them something for it. To this day the siblings he does visit always make go out of their way to show him how hard life is for them so he\u2019s guilted into giving them more money, so he tries to visit as little as possible. The same thing happened with many of his friends who were not as lucky and working lower income jobs, they all believed he was obligated to help them (or at least that\u2019s how he interpreted things), so he eventually cut ties with many of his old friends as well. Where the story gets truly tragic though was with his business partner. As much as my father likes to show off, the other doctor he operated his practice with was even flashier. He always carried around thousands of dollars on his person as his weekly spending money. He loved the attention more than anything else, when they wanted to expand their practice with a second location in a rougher part of the city, his partner was eventually mugged, had his new Porsche stolen, and was shot at gunpoint and eventually succumbed to his wounds later in the hospital. The police never caught the suspects, and were never even able to find the stolen car (believed it was scrapped for parts). But they did believe he was targeted because of how high profile he made himself to be doing things like wearing his physician coat everywhere, carrying a designer briefcase everywhere he went, and driving into work with a new car everyday. This was an instant eye opener for my father, and he immediately understood the value of what it meant to live more modestly. He never imagined that his own success could become his downfall (many don\u2019t). Like clockwork my mother\u2019s words now made sense to him. My mother wasn\u2019t surprised at all, as she\u2019s seen these things happen over and over again: family fighting family over; getting mixed up with the wrong crowd; and people letting their own wealth make them a target. Since then, although my father\u2019s still been successful he\u2019s calmed down a lot on his spending habits and downsized significantly, kept the car he has for over two of the same cars he has had for over twenty five years and has been more modest. That\u2019s not to say our family hasn\u2019t enjoyed the wealth we\u2019ve both made and inherited but we understand the value in keeping many of these things private. Since then he\u2019s always said, \u201cThe world does not need to know you\u2019re rich, and your better off having people not know.\u201d The old money isn\u2019t jealous of the entrepreneurs or professionals who strike success. In all my life being around both new and old money, they in fact are grateful for their parents and grandparents who sacrificed for their wellbeing. What truly separates the New money from the Old is that Old money understands the horrors of wealth better than anyone else, the fracture it can cause between family and friends, and the target it can make you, they generally like to avoid the newly successful who are ignorant of those horrors. The sad part is that when overt and grand images of conspicuous consumption are shown in the media people who aspire to have wealth fall for the trap, they believe that what it means to be successful is to show off what you have, and that because you\u2019ll only live once you should \u201cflaunt it, if you\u2019ve got it.\u201d What we see as success these days is result, not the journey, the journey of sleepless nights at work, educating oneself, imparting a good work ethic and aspirations into children. But when you fail to take into consideration the values imparted onto your children or what you want to leave the next generation, they may lose everything you worked so hard for. \u201cNew money\u201d can\u2019t just become \u201cOld money,\u201d this transition happens over generations.

Drive a Yellow Lamborghini, have a 25,000 square foot home, the newest gadgets and constantly boast and show it off\u2026. Someone who comes from old money (usually) is taught to NEVER speak about the privileged life one\u2019s lived, they were forced to do charity auctions and galas and feel sympathy for poor people and don\u2019t go out of their way to say \u201cSCREW YOU IM SO FUCKING RICH\u201d by driving everywhere in a Red Ferrari and Yellow Lamborghini. Why not get something more subtle like a black or grey Mercedes Benz? They\u2019re also IMPLYING that they\u2019re liek\u2026. the type of people that would overpay for something just to say how much they spent on it\u2026. like when the Russian Billionaire bought his 23 year old daughter the penthouse for 86 million, which was the highest price ever paid for anything at the time \u2014 and the listing certainly was WAY over comps for the building. He just wanted to make the list for being most expensive condo sale ever in NYC\u2026 you know? Or when that obnoxious woman on Real Housewives kept talking about her $25,000 sunglasses\u2026 ",
