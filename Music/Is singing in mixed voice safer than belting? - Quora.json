            "answer_text": "There is more than one way to Belt. Traditional Belting that employs chest voice domination of the vocal folds can be injurious if done incorrectly over a long period of time. But traditional Belting is not always injurious even if done incorrectly over a long period of time. Voices are as variable as the people that have them, and what may work for one singer would be disastrous for another singer. There is another form of Belting that uses an acoustic position of the pharynx (throat) above the vocal folds that creates a Belt sound but allows the vocal folds to vibrate in a completely healthy fashion. This form of Belting can be carried very high in the female range\u2014many of my students are Belting G5, A5, and I even have a few who can truly Belt the high C, C6. These singers are in no way injuring their voices, and they have an equally strong and healthy legit (lyric) tone that allows them to sing even higher. The female voice only has two main registers. The first goes from the bottom of the range to B-flat 4. The second range starts at B4 and goes to the top of the range. Then some female singers have a whistle tone, which is even higher. That B-flat 4/B-natural 4 break has been the traditional limit of the female chest voice Belt range. Anything above that is thought to be a mix of head and chest in Belt\u2026but, there is NO MIX because the female voice is in either one register or the other. We do things acoustically that make it sound like mix, but the vocal folds are functioning either in chest mode or in head mode. The problem in traditional Belting is when the female tries to push the chest register above the B-flat 4. The acoustic Belting I briefly mentioned above avoids this as the vocal folds are allowed to naturally shift between the two register modes at its natural adjustment point. Thus, the female singer that employs this technique can Belt and sing legit throughout most of her range without fatigue or damage. ",

            "answer_text": "First, the idea that there is \u201csafe\u201d and \u201cunsafe\u201d singing is wrongheaded. Any manner of vocal use can be safe and also carry the risk of injury at the same time. Just like dancing. \u201cBelting\u201d especially as it applies to female singers has developed a reputation of being a dangerous manner of singing. This reputation has largely developed out of a fundamental misunderstanding of it. Functionally, to \u201cbelt,\u201d a singer must employ chest voice higher than the natural register transition. (Generally, above F4) For it to read as \u201cbelting\u201d a certain bright timbre must be present. Functionally, the mechanism at the vocal fold level is practically the same as in a male opera singer such as @Domingo. This is chest voice paired with classical operatic sensibilities and resonance strategies. Functionally, the same registration at the vocal fold level as a female belter. @belter So why is one \u201csafer\u201d? But to answer your actual question which I will rephrase to \u201cdoes singing in a mix carry less risk of vocal fold injury than belting\u201d? The answer is a qualified \u201cyes.\u201d Belting is a higher risk behavior for various reasons. But so is playing football. Just like a professional athlete, to minimize your risk of injury you train, you stay in shape, and you use your body in a smart way. I\u2019ll close with this fact, a musical theater belter must sing 8 shows a week. Most of them survive this just fine. ",
