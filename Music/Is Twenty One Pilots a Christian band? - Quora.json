            "answer_text": "Although the band members have referred to themselves as Christians, they don\u2019t specifically claim to be a \u201cChristian band.\u201d A bunch of their songs have underlying metaphors that talk about their faith (or lack thereof) in God. For example, in \u201cAddict With A Pen\u201d, the lyrics imply that Tyler is losing faith in the God he believes in and is trying to ask for redemption. This is actually one of the main themes throughout their self-titled album, Twenty One Pilots. Tyler and Josh have both questioned if there really is a God out there, and if so, where is he? In their music, they plead for forgiveness of their sins or ask for help. And that\u2019s part of what makes Twenty One Pilots such an emotionally relatable band. ",

            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t deny that Josh and Tyler love Christ, and it shows in their music., but this doesn\u2019t necessarily make them a Christian band. I like to call them a \u201cChristian band in a secular disguise.\u201d They are secretly teaching audiences about the love of Christ through their lyrics but put it in such a format that people don\u2019t feel as if it\u2019s too religious or straightforward. It\u2019s amazing to see how two Christian guys could find their way into the secular world, secretly transforming lives through compelling music and metaphorical words. I admire them so much for that! ",
