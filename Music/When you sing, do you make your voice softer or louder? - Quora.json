            "answer_text": "This would really depend on how you want the different parts of the song you\u2019re singing to be presented. A phrase sung loudly can evoke some strong emotions and passion. That same phrase sung softly can have a different impact on the listener by having other instruments drop out at the same time, which could draw special attention to the words themselves. As Nathaniel Manns said, you shouldn\u2019t really HAVE to get louder on a high note. You should be able to control your voice enough to where you can sing a high note in your range either loudly or softly\u2026you should be able to make that decision. So, I guess the real question, then, is what emotion are you trying to convey? This is something that you\u2019ll need to answer for yourself depending on the song you\u2019re singing. As a suggestion, if you want a portion of the song to convey stronger emotions, passion, energy, drive, etc\u2026then sing loudly. If you want a portion of the song to convey more intimacy, focused attention, calmness, quietness, etc\u2026then sing softer. If you\u2019re singing with other musicians, keep in mind to talk about your vision for each portion of the song with the whole band so that way you\u2019re not trying to quiet everything down while the drummer and electric guitarist are trying to drive on and rock out. Keep everyone together with respect to the dynamics of the song, and as a group you\u2019ll be able to present a unified and impactful vision of the song to your audience. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. If I want a softer tone I make it softer. If I want a louder tone I make it louder. Singing is about control. You shouldn\u2019t HAVE to get louder on a high note. You shouldn\u2019t HAVE to do anything. You should be able to control every aspect of your voice that you can. Caveat: Projection is something you should know, makes your voice very \u201cloud\u201d.
