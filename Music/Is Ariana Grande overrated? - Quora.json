            "answer_text": "Definitely not\u2026..Billie Eilish yes\u2026.Ariana no. I listen to music non stop of all modern types\u2026.i did download her Dangerous Woman album when it first came out 2015 i think,vaguely aware she had sung a few songs prior\u2026.but this album was good and her voice is engaging and was definitely on point for the tracks she was singing. I wouldn\u2019t class my self as a fan,i just appreciate what she does,i really like her voice and the way she sings,i love her recent hit 7 rings,it had a very clever Julie Andrews reference. She has a very youthful Mariah Carey vibe and has a voice that can be adapted to many different styles and she can still sound good,she really is quite versatile,handy for those that write her hits. she has that Va Va voom. She\u2019s not over rated at all\u2026\u2026.Billie The Grudge Eillish is another story. ",

            "answer_text": "I will admit that as an artist, she\u2019s one of only a handful of people from the last 20 years that I respect. She really can sing and she\u2019s had the good fortune (?) of having very good songs written for her. Although, one can speculate about what she had to do in order to get those songs\u2026 She\u2019s also proven herself to be a very funny girl in comedy sketches, which is RARE for any woman. She can definitely throw down jokes with the boys and pull it off. However, I also feel I have a right to have an opinion on her extremely busy love life, since she so actively shares it with the world, anyway. And as far as I can tell, when it comes to men, she has depressingly poor taste. And just like Taylor Swift, she also seems to be a right old ho. ",
