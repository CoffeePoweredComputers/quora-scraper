            "answer_text": "What should I learn when playing piano Tks for Jon Nolan 's technique and ways to l_e_a_r_n pianno effectivly in 6 weeks.Thank Jon Nolan 5 WAYS TO LEARN PIANO EFFECTIVELY IN 6 WEEKS: 1. Get your friend or relative or acquaintance to teach you piano. This is perhaps the cheapest and easiest method. You can learn fast because it is after all your friend or relative who is teaching you, and you can fix the time as per your requirements. Of course you will need the piano, and some resources, but if you are not planning to learn it to become a pro, then you can perhaps do away with the resource materials. You can also be quite sure of learning some good simple songs quite early and can show them off to your friends too! 2. Find some good online resources where everything related to piano is being taught. Find a website where there are lots of video lessons, ample resources and tips as well as some kind of a schedule-based learning curriculum. Stick to the site (which means do not keep switching sites and dropping them) and learn everything that it teaches. There are plenty of them today which have a very thorough and clear resources including lessons, exercises etc. Below are suggested resources to learn piano by Quorarian Jennife Lee: . Private teachers . Piano schools . Best 3 piano channels on YouTube: LearnPianoLive, HDpiano, PianoPig. . Best forums: Reddit piano (125k members) is the best place to discuss and learn piano. Alteratives: Pianostreet forum, Pianoworld forum . PianoHandbook365 .club/2019/free-ebook-31-tips-to-become-a-pro-piano-player.html . Best frree training site: 701PianoVideos .info 3. Get a piano learning software program. They might cost you a bit, but when they come with plenty of video lessons and resource manuals, as wells as thousands of lessons, exercises and even evaluating tools, you can almost think of it as a piano tutor! 4. Learning from a tutor. The first thing that may come into your mind if you are thinking of learning the piano is to find a personal tutor who can help you learn the instrument. This can mean allotting your time to a fixed schedule every week to be able to go to your personal tutor or have him come over for the tutorial. One advantage of course of a personal tutor is the fact that he can see you learn and correct you as soon as he finds you not doing it correctly. 5. Learning on your own. Yes, you can actually learn to play piano on your own. With a lot of resources you can find around you, learning the piano can be easy. You can find free tutorial videos online, or find websites and blogs of music enthusiasts who are generous enough to share their skills. However, it is important to keep in mind that learning on your own especially if you are a total beginner may not be the best way to learn piano. In learning the piano and any musical instruments, it is important that you have to learn it correctly right from the start and this may be a little difficult if you are on your own. In fact, one thing that can also be difficult with learning on your own is that, you may not be following the lessons step by step and errors that you may develop early on may not be corrected right away.

Which topics are usually the hardest and thus need the greatest amount of concentration and practice and by one point along this line is a person at \u2018intermediate\u2019 level?I am posting this question as myself and many others that wish to learn this instrument and have no prior experience of any musical instruments would like to know this. Everybody learns best in different ways but personally I was getting nowhere until I tried this course: Pianoforall | Learn Piano & Keyboard | 200 Video Lessons I like having everything laid out so I can see myself progress through it and I know what I need to be working on. To get to the point where you can play very simple songs easily, you should give yourself at least half a year. Everything after that is pretty much just practice until you keep getting gradually better. I should add that probably the hardest hurdle to get over in all of this is playing both hands at the same time (and reading two clefs at the same time - three if you\u2019re also singing). For some people, it\u2019s really hard. Especially when they\u2019re both playing \u2018melody\u2019. I am assuming you want a break down of learning piano as from its origins in western culture, as in you are more likely going to want to play a Bach fugue on the piano vs. an Indian raga. Acoustics and mechanics: how the piano works with hammers, why there is only one string for the lowest note and three for the highest note, pedals, open lid vs. closed lid, upright vs. grand piano, electric piano vs. acoustic piano. Music Theory: Note names, time signature, changes of time, rhythm, durations, scales, arpeggios, chords (diads, triads, etc.), key signatures, reading the grand staff including dynamic and tempo markings, tuning systems. If one wishes to take private lessons or perhaps some other means of formally learning the piano, what are the topics that one must cover and in what order?If we\u2019re talking piano lessons with any type of teacher, the teacher himself will have it\u2019s own technique or approach on how to play the piano. There are a lot of different things he can teach in a lot of different order. Which topics are usually the hardest and thus need the greatest amount of concentration and practice and by one point along this line is a person at \u2018intermediate\u2019 level?Once again a question opened to a lot of interpretations. When do a piano player reach the \u2018intermediate\u2019 level.. Who can really define what is an \u2018intermediate\u2019 level ? It might seem a little much to ask yourself all these questions but trust me, I decided to stop there because there are a hundred more that could define how long it would take you and where you would have to start. Now that we\u2019ve ruled out all the theory about how much your question is opened to interpretation, I guess you want some real explanations so let\u2019s start by implying you haven\u2019t touch a piano ever and you want to learn all by yourself.

Also, understanding how chords work will enable you to pick out chords with your lefts hand while playing a melody with your right hand. I recommend that you get a teacher. You can learn some basic music from books and online, but it\u2019s never as good as getting a teacher. A teacher will help you recognize notes and chording. Practicing scales will teach your fingers how to react to pressing keys. Learning to play the piano doesn\u2019t happen overnight. You need good teaching and lots of practice. Without a lot of practice you will never succeed. Good luck with your piano playing. You\u2019ll enjoy the time spent on the piano. It is a wonderful way to pass the time. I recommend that you get a real piano. Electric and electronic pianos can just not produce the good sound you get from a real piano. ",

            "answer_text": "In one word, it\u2019s awareness. Learning to be an engaged listener of your sound in the moment is most important. Being able to listen to that sound and adjust your playing to fit your intended expression will make your performance a richer experience for you and your audience. Not all pianos, rooms, or audiences are the same; nor will your body be exactly the same from day to day, and a good pianist is aware of all of these differences when performing. This is most important to learn as a beginner, however abstract this idea might be. A lack of this awareness reduces the pianist to a machine executing a series of notes at prescribed times and volumes. A good piano performance is, of course, much more than this. Consider someone who\u2019s cooking, yet doesn\u2019t bother to taste the dish along the way to completion. How will that dish turn out in the end? Someone may cook that way if they\u2019ve made a dish a few hundred times, but even so\u2026would you want your performance at the piano to sound like that\u2014rote? The rest of the advice here, specifically regarding form and technique, is all very good and necessary for great control at the piano\u2014but is ultimately secondary to awareness. ",

You should be sitting at a height relative to the piano where your arm forms an L on your hands naturally fall towards the keys. I also I also can't stress enough The Importance of Being able to fit your fingers in between the Black Keys. If you avoid trying to fit your fingers in between the Black Keys your finger posture will be off and many passages will be impossible and difficult to play. Also it's important not to over press into the keyboard also it's important not to over press into the keyboard as that fatigues to fingers and strains your ligaments only hit the key hard enough to create the sound and then instantly relax.

Pick something appropriate\u2013 for instance, if you\u2019re just learning to play the C major scale for the first time, I wouldn't go out there and learn a Liszt Hungarian Rhapsody. I don't know your current level, so it's hard for me to say what you should be playing. If you're just starting out, Bartok\u2019s Mikrokosmos and Burgmuller\u2019s 25 progressive pieces, along with Donald Waxman\u2019s beginning piano series would be pretty good. As always, I recommend a teacher\u2013 they help you learn faster and help you avoid pitfalls caused by practicing technique poorly. Also, a teacher could help with picking repertoire that's interesting and challenging, but not too difficult. ",

But beyond that: Focussing on the correct technique* right from the start will speed up the whole process immensely, even though it won\u2019t seem so at first. You can balance the initial frustration with learning a new song every week or two (for improving your sight-reading and just to have more \u2018fun\u2019 pieces to enjoy), while spending much more time on a more complicated piece to practice and improve your technique. *Hand and wrist position, relaxing the shoulders, sitting correctly, controlling the pedals, and never, ever underestimate the importance of all the scales and arpeggios - it will create \u201cmuscle memory\u201d that will not only help you learn and play passages faster and more evenly, but also help when choosing the best fingering for each passage.

Each instrument has it\u2019s own purpose and on voice. For example if you think drums think you\u2019r thinking ok we need this to keep time and rhythm. When you think bass you think of we need something to carry the bottom to sustain the foundation of the music. So it\u2019s basically the same as a piano. In most cases the piano if usually the lead instrument of the music which is usually the first thing people go to for learning, accompaniment, songwriting and other things as well. I would say the important thing about learning the piano is to first understand the instrument and the purpose of the instrument. After you fully understand that then you will learn things much better within the instrument rather you\u2019re learning a song or if you\u2019re using the instrument to write a song. Hope this was helpful. ",

So, for this, here is my answer: You should start off by learning the notes, which, as you will see, they repeat every octave, therefore being relatively easy. Then, you should probably start playing with them, thus experimenting with rhythms! From there on, you can probably get a piano book, look into online free lessons, or get a real-life tutor, that will help you progress through you time on the piano. It will eventually come to the time where you can learn to play full pieces of music, and once mastered, you can perform to an audience! The pieces should become slightly harder and harder each time so it challenges you, consequently upping your skill, and comfortability to play the piano. :) ",

Once you get familiar with chords, learn ways of connecting chord tones together (melodic lines). One way this is done is with scale tones, so at that point you would be learning scales!

I would learn scales, then find the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and sixth chord of the scale (maybe also the sevenths for a more interesting experience) and just play around with the chord sequence, basically by arranging the chords in an order of your choice, and then improvise using mostly the notes from your chord, with following notes every so often. That\u2019s basically what I do, and I managed to squeeze a few compositions out of it. ",

Taking into consideration your ability to learn, your teacher\u2019s ability to instruct, it will take some time to get rolling, but be patient. If your teacher assigns something, do twice at much if you can. Also know that many songs are published formatted for beginning, intermediate, and advanced players. Learn the notes quickly. Learn the staves quickly. Learn not to look at your hands while playing. The rest will come quickly. ",

I, myself would recommend Chopin\u2019s One Minute Waltz, it\u2019s quite popular among classical music. Mendelssohn\u2019s compositions are fantastic! Beethoven's Moonlight sonata is a moody, somewhat dramatic piece, that I would recommend to people of all ages. Hope this helps! ",
