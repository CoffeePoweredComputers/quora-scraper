            "answer_text": "As to feeling lonely and sad for the last few days, please know that this is not uncommon.  We all feel blue from time to time, so you have the option of \u201criding it out\u201d as long as you have the right attitude about it.  That is, this is okay and I\u2019m okay because \u201cthis too shall pass.\u201d If you think it\u2019s tied to a specific event, the sadness in particular may be a very natural response to that event.  In that case, give it some time to subside. If it\u2019s something you think is temporary, engaging your mind in an activity or project which is a distraction will help you feel better until it subsides.  Such a distraction can also help dissipate those negative feelings. Being alone does not cause a feeling of loneliness unless that aloneness has been imposed on you by someone or something outside yourself.  That feeling of loneliness could easily bring on a feeling of sadness.  In this instance, a change in your perspective will help enormously.  In fact, if you don\u2019t change your perspective about it by viewing it as a positive experience, because it gives you the time and space to engage in some beneficial self-reflection, for instance, or a chance to write or do something else you\u2019ve wanted to do, both the loneliness and sadness will begin to consume you and take over your life.  That\u2019s a hole you don\u2019t want to fall into as it can be very difficult to climb out of it. If, on the other hand, this happens to you quite often, it might be helpful to look at what changes, if any, it brings into your life.  Do you suddenly get more attention from certain people?  Do you, instead, end up pushing people away, which then validates a particular view or belief you have about life? The answers to those and similar questions matter, because people generally do what they do because they receive some benefit, a payoff, for it.  For instance, if someone grows up around a lot of chaos and drama, he or she may end up fabricating events that bring on chaos and drama merely because it\u2019s a comfortable state to be in \u2014 the person knows what to expect and has developed different ways of coping with it.  The payoff is the comfort level the person has with chaos and drama. Another example is the child who is unable to get his/her parents\u2019 attention by being good or doing well.  Craving attention, such a child will act out and misbehave in order to get attention because, to a child, negative attention is better than no attention. Also remember that self-talk a person engages in is far more controlling of our mood, perspective, attitude and beliefs than people realize.  It may help to think of it as your mind having a white dog and a black dog inside that constantly battle over what you should think and do.  The one who wins on any given day is the one who\u2019s fed the most.  If the conversation you have with yourself supports the positive views of the white dog, the loneliness and sadness supported by the black dog will lose. So, to answer your question, there are several options available depending on what you determine is the source or cause of feeling lonely and sad.  In the end, though, the extent to which it takes over your life will depend on your attitude about it. ",
