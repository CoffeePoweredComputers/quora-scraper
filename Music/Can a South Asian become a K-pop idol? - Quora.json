            "answer_text": "Chances are slim, but that's only because companies tend to want people from certain geographical regions. Usually, South Korean, Japanese and Chinese people are the ones who audition due to them usually possessing the same traits that companies look for. Companies look for Pale complexionAbility to speak at least KoreanSmall faceSlim buildDouble eyelidsLarge EyesAnd most importantly, talent and good looks. While South Asians do mainly possess double eyelids and large eyes, pretty much due to genes, they are definitely not one of the people sought after for becoming idols. This might be due to the fact that K-pop does not have a strong influence in India where many people prefer Hindustani and Carnatic music in the North and South, respectively. To my knowledge, there are also not many K-pop fans in India so they don't feel the urge to market toward India by debuting Indian idols. If you have confidence and the talent to make up for it, go give it a shot! Who knows,maybe you will be the pioneer K-pop idol from India. Thanks for the A2A!! ",

The only way to find out is to audition! But don\u2019t be surprised if the companies pass due to risk aversion even if you do a great job. ",

I mean Lisa is Thai and she is in a Kpop group so maybe?

To sum up my POV - becoming a K-pop idol for a South Asian is far-fetched, we simply don\u2019t have the look for it. K-pop is K-pop for a reason, if I wanted to see a South Asian person singing a song or dancing to a tune I\u2019d switch to Bollywood or some Pakistani music channel (both of which have produced LEGENDARY music). I would love to be proven wrong however, just for the sake of witnessing an anomaly or something unique. ",

Go to South Korea and do auditions in different companies if you think that you\u2019re good enough to be a trainee or a kpop idol. Also, adjust to the South Korean culture. This is important. A lot of foreigners are now venturing into Kpop (Japanese, Thais, Chinese, etc) but since they have adjusted to the culture, kpop fans have slowly adapt to them. If you really want to be a kpop idol, work hard, train hard and one of the fruits of your labor is having fans that will accept you no matter what race you came from. ",
