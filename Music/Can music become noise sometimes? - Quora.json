            "answer_text": "There is not a simple dividing line where sound stops being \u201cmusic\u201d and starts being \u201cnoise.\u201d It really depends how you feel about what you are listening to. There is a whole genre of music called Noise - artists like Merzbow, Wolf Eyes, Stockhausen and lots of others have done all sorts of different things with sound that are meant to break the rules about what makes something music or challenge our concept of what music is. Then there are a lot of bands that mix elements of music structure - a steady beat, a repetitive riff, or something like that - with unstructured parts, sometimes as a way of exploring what it would sound like if you incorporate noise into a type of music or pair it with other things. So it\u2019s a whole gradient. The experimental musician John Cage once said that he was more interested in listening to the traffic in Manhattan than Mozart or Beethoven, because the traffic noises always sounded different. But on the other extreme, some people describe types of music they don\u2019t like or don\u2019t relate to as noise. The other thing is that music isn\u2019t just the sound you hear; the way you think about the music you hear has to do with your relation to it and the context. Being forced to listen to music you didn\u2019t choose to listen to can be grating no matter what it sounds like. Hearing music you like on tinny laptop speakers can be annoying; so can music that is played way too loud at a concert. Microphone feedback - that loud, high pitched shriek you hear when the microphone gets too close to the speaker - can be an unwelcome mistake at a Taylor Swift concert, but the artist Prurient has a whole album that is basically just microphone feedback. At the end of the day, we use words like \u201cmusic\u201d and \u201cnoise\u201d to describe things, but when we look more closely, the meaning behind almost every word has some gray areas. ",

            "answer_text": "Can music become noise sometimes ? Answer: The sound which is unpleasant for our ears is called noise. Music is the sound which is pleasant for our ears and has soothing affect. Music can become noise at many instances. When someone tries to enjoy very loud music, it can be noise for someone else. When loud music is played during religious celebrations or marriages, it can be annoying for many people. Another difference is that music is produced by regular vibrations whereas noise is produced by irregular vibrations. Depending on how it\u2019s organized, you might still consider it noise. Purely a matter of taste. If music becomes harsh or loud then it is called noise especially when it causes unpleasant sensation in the ear.  ",

            "answer_text": "Well, honestly, music can already be defined as noise. By matter of my opinion. I mean, just because it's nice to listen to doesn't mean it's any less something that you are heating. Therefore can be clarified as noise. Even though it has Melody and time and pitch and many other things, so do many other noses, just depends on how you look at it. I guess a series of noses would have to be made to be music though. Now thinking about it. ",
