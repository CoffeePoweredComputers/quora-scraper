            "answer_text": "A couple of years back now, there was a story about an American Airlines flight that made an emergency landing when one of their passengers refused to stop singing at the top of her lungs. She was still defiantly belting \"I Will Always Love You\" as the police took her away. At the time, people said it was on overreaction and that it was non-threatening, so why the fuss. But if I had been a passenger on that flight, I would've gladly applauded if she had been tackled and duct taped to the seat and her mouth taped shut. Passengers who think it's okay to burst into song whenever the urge comes upon them, completely disregarding the comfort of the other travelers sharing this confined space with them need to be made an example of. I mean really. If you were to take a bus, plane or subway regularly, you\u2019d encounter these rude types here and there in your travels. It\u2019s especially bad when you see some fairly innocuous looking chap singing whatever is playing through his earbuds. He seems to understand that playing the source music through the device\u2019s speakers is frowned upon, so he's wearing headphones so only he can hear what's playing. But singing along defeats the purpose, forcing the rest of us to listen to not just his choice of music, but a really bad a Capella version of it. Even if he has a marvelous voice and range, which never seems to be the case since usually it\u2019s like hearing something resembling a cat being set on fire, it\u2019s still incredibly rude. It's not the quality of the voice that matters; it's that we're being forced to listen to something we didn't volunteer to for a sustained period of time. I realize it may seem trivial to some, but this isn\u2019t a Karaoke Bar or America\u2019s Got Talent. And, as we\u2019re all witnessing, you don\u2019t have any and we can\u2019t just hit the reject button to shut you up. At least the Apollo Theater talent night has a real hook to get you off the stage. We\u2019re not given that option in a plane or train. If the horrifying stares of the people around you still don\u2019t put you off your Glee performance, just think about the idea that if someone gets irate enough, you may have nowhere to run. Your singing is akin to forcing the people sharing your space to whiff the scent of a sulfurous rotten egg fart you\u2019ve unleashed on them. I mean, you\u2019re just sharing in a public space, right?  ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think that singing in public is strange provided you can sing average. In fact if you sing well, people might encourage you to continue singing or smile at you. However when we are not at home and at public place, we do want to maintain the volume of our singing. If you sing poorly, it might be viewed or heard differently by other people. For example if you sing poor, they might look with pity for you or if you sing loud with strange voice, somebody might even laugh at you. If you are on earphones and humming with it while waiting for bus or sitting somewhere, it would be of no one\u2019s concern. However if you are on earphone and ride or drive or stand in someone\u2019s way and keep fiddling with your phone, other people might get irritated. ",
