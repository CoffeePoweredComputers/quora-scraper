            "answer_text": "\"STREET FIGHTING MAN,\" THE ROLLING STONESBeggars Banquet (1968) One might assume this rebel yell, released during the tumultuous summer of 1968, would rage with the sound of electric guitars. Not so: with the exception of an electric bass, played by Keith Richards, the track is 100 percent acoustic. Preparing a demo for the song, Richards miked two acoustics and recorded them into a cheap Phillips mono cassette recorder. The guitarist was so enamored of the resulting distortion (the machine had no limiters, causing the signal to overload) he decided to go au naturale and ditch the electrics. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.audiko2.pro ",
