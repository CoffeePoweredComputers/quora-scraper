            "answer_text": "A few reasons to consider: 1. In the type uses you mention, where the song is actually supposed to be playing in the world of the movie, the specific intention is that it evokes the real space the scene is supposed to be taking place in, and adds realism and believability.  So you don't want it to sound, in the movie, like the original recording; you want it to sound like that recording would sound at the scene.  So, naturally, for a club (where the bass is boomin') that is emphasized, as well as more subtle things like the timings of echoes and the way the sound might change if the characters move behind a wall or into an adjoining room.   The same is true of any other scene where there is ; the sound is modified to create a more convincing experience of being \"in\" the moment.  2. For songs that are used as part of the soundtrack music (that is, they are for us, the audience, to hear but aren't supposed to be \"happening\" in the movie), the objective is different.   Such songs are nearly always remixed from their original versions for both practical and artistic reasons:  movie soundtracks contain many more channels (including subwoofer and surround channels) than standard stereo music, so they must be remixed for that purpose.  Songs are also often re-equalized to sound great in a movie theater, which has different acoustics and capabilities from a home or car system.  Where songs are overlaid with dialog and/or sound effects, certain frequencies may be cut to avoid competing.   Songs may also be edited, re-arranged, or looped to better sync up with the rhythms of the dialog and film editing.    3. Sometimes an alternative version or significant remix/DJ mix, or even a completely new performance, might better suit the mood of the scene, or might be done to update the style of an older tune to more modern settings.  This has the commercial side benefit of making the \"new\" version a sellable product which can be part of the movie soundtrack album or released as a single.  A key change is rather rare, but might be used to fit the song better to the key of the film score.    (Note that \"remix\" has a least two different meanings, both of which are in play here). ",
