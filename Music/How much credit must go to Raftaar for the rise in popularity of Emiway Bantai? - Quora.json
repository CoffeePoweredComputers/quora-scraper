            "answer_text": "about 75% credit should go to raftaar, because he was the one who introduced emiway to Manj musik. He was the one who wanted emiway to join the label. Before that he was recognized only by underground rappers and few mumbaikars few years ago he auditioned in India's got talent and his song \u2018aur bantai' became a hit. He was a one-hit artist and after raftaar announced #sadak with an upcoming artist emiway, his fans were buzzing. Everyone was excited as raftaar is known to bring out rappers from the underground scene. #sadak was a good track and fans demanded another song with emiway and they were In talks with #sadakremix and in an interview people asked him who was a better artist emiway or divine and he answered divine. Of course emiway didn't like it. In that interview he also said that rappers like emiway aren't earning a lot right now. He wasnt lying. Then he said, \u201c Mei emiway ka scene change kar dunga\u201d he said All this out of humbleness and respect to both the artist. Emiway got an opportunity to diss raftaar. Emiway Dissed him with street slangs and Energy filled tracks while raftaar had to respond otherwise he would lose respect from other rappers he responded with clever wordplay and a great flow. If raftaar would've not dissed emiway he wouldve lost respect from other rappers and his huge fan following. He was trapped. Emiway cleverly laid out a trap. His popularity was inevitable. If raftaar didn't respond then Emiway would've gained sympathy from the audience. Emiway played it smartly. But raftaar still won our hearts. ",

            "answer_text": "70%! WHY!? FIRST OF ALL THERE WAS NO REASON FOR EMIWAY TO START THIS BEEF. HE IS A SMART ARTIST AND USED HIS CLEVERNESS TO GAIN POPULARITY. WE ALL KNOW THAT RAFTAAR MADE THAT STATEMENT IN THE MOST HUMBLE WAY POSSIBLE. BUT THIS BEEF HELPED EMIWAY REACH A DIFFERENT HEIGHT, LET ME PUT THIS INTO PERSPECTIVE, BEFORE THE BEEF STARTED EMIWAY HAD 600K SUBSCRIBERS AND AFTER THE BEEF ENDED EMIWAY HAD NEAR 2 MIL. SUBSCRIBERS THAT WAS LIKE IN 2 MONTHS. WHY 70%? BECOZ RAFTAAR WAS WELL AWARE THAT HIM REPLYING TO EMIWAY WOULD GIVE HIM A LOT OF ATTENTION IN THE INDIAN RAP SCENE STILL HE CAME UP WITH DISSES WHICH HE COULD HAVE EASILY AVOIDED. NOW ABOUT THE REST OF THE 30%, THAT GOES TO EMIWAY FOR HIS SMARTNESS, TIMING OF STARTING THE BEEF, HIS RAPPING SKILLS, HIS WORDPLAY, ENERGY, SMART COMEBACKS AND GREAT PRODUCTION. ",
