            "answer_text": "There are a whole lot of considerations, and if you are an advanced piano player you know more than we do about how you prioritize things. There are some things acoustic pianos can do better than digital pianos, soundwise, although even that can be argued. (*) There are a HUGE number of things a digital piano can do that an acoustic simply can\u2019t. From playing with headphones, to changing the instrument sound to recording MIDI (and possibly tweaking the performance after the fact), to putting it in your car to take to a gig or rehearsal or audition. I personally wouldn\u2019t recommend spending all $10,000 now. Remember that digital equipment becomes outdated as newer better stuff comes along. You can get a MIDI controller and a nice computer, and upgrade parts of it in 5 or 10 years or whenever you want. Even spending $5k, you could have something like this, which is incredibly powerful compared to an acoustic piano.  * note that many times when you see a performer playing piano on stage, it is really a digital piano with an acoustic-looking cabinet. And if you are recording, a digital piano might sound better because you don\u2019t have to bother with mic\u2019ing it\u2026.you can just have it send MIDI to your computer, and record it using a VST. If you are recording using a computer with a physically modeled synthetic piano sound, I seriously doubt many people can tell the difference between it and a real acoustic piano.

            "answer_text": "You can buy one heck of an outstanding new Samick acoustic grand ( discounted to $12,000 +/- for 5\u20324\u2033 and 5\u20327\u2033 ). For an advanced player a digital is completely out of the question. I had a Yamaha Clavinova and then an old Yamaha C3 while in grad school in 1993. I think I would have preferred a new Samick. I'd splurge just a little and avoid the digital. Shop carefully and patiently. In addition to teaching, I sold pianos for a number of years. It's a cutthroat business. Look for a 20% discount, or say you're ready to walk. Look for a showroom instrument the dealer is desperate to move. He won't tell you. A used Samick or Yamaha carefully evaluated by a technician should be available somewhere. Ken S Madell ",

            "answer_text": "As an advanced pianist, you\u2019d ideally want to get a good grand piano. An upright or a cheap grand won\u2019t cut it. Although a good, new grand piano is more than $10k, I\u2019d imagine you can find a good used piano at that price. I personally use a digital piano and I love it. However, it\u2019s definitely not the same as a grand piano. The dynamic range is less, the key mechanism is not quite the same (not necessarily better or worse, but it\u2019s different from an acoustic\u2014and different among the brands of digitals), and not all nuances of pedaling are modeled. If I were a professional, it wouldn\u2019t be an acceptable substitute for an acoustic piano. However, I think the advantages are worth it for me: $2000 can buy a really good digital pianoSound is surprisingly realisticMake high-quality recordings easily: no expensive mic or studio neededCan use headphones to practice without bothering neighborsNo tuning or maintenance, less sensitive to temperature and humidityUsually comes with lots of instrument sounds (including different varieties of pianos, if you want a darker or brighter sound for different pieces) and other features (metronome, transpose, tunings, recording/playback stuff, etc)Reasonably portable: you don\u2019t need to hire special movers for itYou can visit a music store and try their digital pianos. This will probably be the most useful thing you can do to help with your decision! ",

            "answer_text": "It depends what kind of place you live. Having a $10,000 piano, but never being able to play it due to noise complaints from neighbors makes it useless. If you\u2019re going to be able to play it whenever you want \u2014 acoustic is great. Likewise, if you\u2019re like me, and stay up and practice all night, but have other people in the house, the argument for a hybrid is strong. On the other hand, if you\u2019re going to be using it to record, or teaching high level classical students, some people aren\u2019t going to be so keen on a digital. That said, you don\u2019t necessarily need to spend anywhere near that amount for a great digital. There are incredible hybrids in the low thousands. ",

If other considerations allow (like space, need for regular maintenance and people around that would force you to play with headphones), I would prefer acoustic. Especially for an advanced player. For digital, $10 000 is quite an overkill, in the $2 000 - 4 000 range the digitals are so good that I can\u2019t see who would need anything more expensive. ",

Don\u2019t worry about the case; it\u2019s nice to have a beautiful case, but it really doesn\u2019t contribute to the sound. Also, the piano will have been played a lot, and the hammers could be very worn down. This makes for a tinny sound. Among the pianos I would look for would be: a Mason Hamlin AA (6\u20324\u2033), or a Stieff, an A.B. Chase, or Conover, and the like. Replace the hammers. Have this work be done by a real artist-craftsman. I think you would be more than pleased! ",
