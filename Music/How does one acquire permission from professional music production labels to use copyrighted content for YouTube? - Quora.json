            "answer_text": "Hi, Generally when it comes to copyrighting and using other people's content, there are a few factors deciding how you can use it and how you can gain permission to do so. Check if the work you want to copy is already under a license. Usually for YouTube, you can expand the description box and see what license is used. Most commonly it will be the standard YouTube license, which is fine. A quick google of the license will state whether you can use the content with or without permission or at all. It will also state whether you need to give credit.If you need to ask permission, you have a number of options. For YouTube specifically, this is what I recommend. If it is a bigger channel with an obvious following\u2014it is not uncommon for the channel to have a contact email for \u2018business enquiries\u2019. Find this email under the \u2018About\u2019 section of the channels\u2019 page. Simply drop him/her an email and state the following;Exactly what content you are copying.What video you will be using it in i.e. type of content, title of video.How big your prospective audience will beIf there is no email provided, chances are this is a small channel and so you should be able to leave a comment in the description of a recent video\u2014and the content creator should get back to you.There should be no contract required if this is on YouTube and there is a mutual agreement in writing\u2014i.e. an email conversation. Even if the creator states that you do not have to credit him in your video; it is good policy and good manners to do so anyway. I hope I could clear up some of your doubts/queries in this stupidly long answer! Best, ~David ",

            "answer_text": "Effectively, you will be unable to afford this. Known bands are not cheap. Technically you contact the licensing department for the record publisher and begin negotiations on the use license, explaining your intent and what your budget for music licensing is. And then the producer (you) and the label haggle over the price. For instance, let\u2019s say that you wanted to have Shakira as the music to a video you were making. (Presumably she has not penned a deal with YouTube to allow use in videos in exchange for monetizing your video for her benefit.) You would contact Sony Music Licensing: Welcome to Sony Music Licensing. And then you could very easily begin the process through their song search and licensing work. They even have a section for non-profit organizations or student licensing. (You\u2019ll need to register and have your application approved in order to use their site. This takes a few days.) They offer upfront pricing with essentially no room for negotiation. And the prices are market-competitive, meaning that they are almost certainly out of the reach of someone intending to post to YouTube. ",
