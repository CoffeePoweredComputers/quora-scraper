            "answer_text": "Not sure of what form of tuning of an orchestra. If an orchestra is tuned at 440 Hz or 446 Hz it is about how bright they will sound. If you ask about different orchestra instruments are tuned differently, here is the most probable answer\u2026 they are tuned different to get a specific timbre at the cost of different scales. Take English Horn vs Oboe\u2026 English Horn is designed 5th lower to fill the baritone range - to sounds lower and give a fuller timbre. Tune it at normal \u201cscale\u201d it will sound too similar with Oboe. ",
