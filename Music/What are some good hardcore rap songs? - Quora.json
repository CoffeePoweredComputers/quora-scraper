            "answer_text": "I know the following artists I'll mention aren't as relative to your requests, but they're really good to \"bump\" to.  My favorite: Odd Future (OFWGKTA). All members of this group include Tyler, The Creator; Earl Sweatshirt, Domo Genesis, Hodgy Beats, Left Brain, Mike G, Frank Ocean, Jasper Dolphin, Taco Bennett, and Syd tha Kyd. Some are more famous than others. TygaMGK (Machine Gun Kelly)MellowhypeMMG (Maybach Music Group, Rick Ross founded this) Meek MillKanye West Young Money (only a few songs, I personally am not into Drake and Nicki Minaj, or their songs that you hear on the radio.)I am the kind of person who enjoys listening to high-bass, very explicit and people love my music. Look up my playlist on Spotify \"innapropriate for all ages.\" by Kristin Boothe. That will also give you an idea of what I listen to. If I didn't help, let me know and I'll get more \"technical.\" I am a typical highschool teen, so I know what I'm talking about! Hope this helps :) ",

            "answer_text": "\"Kill You\" and \"I'm Back\" from Eminem's Marshall Mathers LP. Hardcore lyrics, hard beats. Super menacing, simple Dre beats that work perfectly with Eminem's rapping. Bitches Ain't Shit - Dr. Dre Sorry, I know it's wrong, but this is great music. Another rough, simple Dre beat (this one was mentioned in the question details):  Big Pun - Tres Leches (Triboro Trilogy) This is so rugged. I mean, a sample from Scarface (the movie) and one from Rakim. And some super-menacing verses from Prodigy, Big Pun, and Inspectah Deck.  ",
