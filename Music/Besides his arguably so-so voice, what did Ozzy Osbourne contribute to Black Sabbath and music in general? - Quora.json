            "answer_text": "Anyone who thinks Ozzy has a so-so voice just doesn't get it.  Ozzy Osbourne didn't have a pretentious bone in his entire body - which made his vocal style urgent, real and honest. Ozzy had so much soul and emotion; everything he had experienced and endured, everything he wanted to escape from, came out in his singing, with his incredibly unique voice. Back in the 70's, before the explosion of studio magic and trickery, Ozzy would often get his vocal tracks done in a couple of takes. No over dubs, no punch ins, no auto tune. Not to say he hasn't relied heavily on those technologies in the past 30 years, but during the rise and advent of Black Sabbath, what you heard on record was pure Ozzy. Lyrically, I can imagine bassist Geezer Butler, furiously writing the words, knowing exactly what Ozzy was going to do with them. And the singer would deliver every time. Ozzy would punctuate the lines with all types of exclamation as well - peppering the songs with Ha-haaa's!! and Oh, Lord Yeah's!! like no one had ever heard. Ozzy was into it, man. One of the most influential and immediately recognizable voices in the history of any music style, completely inimitable, Ozzy held up his corner of the heavy table slab that was Black Sabbath, equally and with as much creativity and tenacity as the other three members. Black Sabbath aren't considered the most impactful and revered band in all of heavy metal for nothing, and Ozzy Osbourne's contributions weigh in substantially. What did Ozzy contribute to Sabbath? Without Ozzy, there is no Sabbath. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a funny story, actually. Tony Iommi knew Ozzy in school, and couldn\u2019t stand him. Tony made a point to bully Ozzy, and make his life miserable. So you can imagine Tony\u2019s reaction to the notice Ozzy posted at a local music shop: Ozzy Zig seeks gig. Has own PA Any singer with his own PA system in those days was worth it, although Tony said, \u201cOzzy? I know an Ozzy, but it couldn\u2019t be him\u201d. And of course, it was. But he had his own PA system, and he brought along Terry \u201cGeezer\u201d Butler with him, so that was that. Ozzy is not much of a singer. It\u2019s true. He had zero formal training. Almost no range. He can barely carry a tune in a bucket, and was not adept whatsoever at crafting vocal melodies. He also wasn\u2019t a lyricist - Geezer took that role for Black Sabbath. What Ozzy really contributed was a stage presence. He may not be a great singer, but he\u2019s a perfectly serviceable vocalist and he was a fantastic showman for the band. Listening to any live Black Sabbath recording from the seventies is to listen to Ozzy work the crowd like a revival preacher: come on, I can\u2019t fucking hear you! LOUDER! LOUDER!!! GOD BLESS YOU, WE LOVE YOU ALL! Without Ozzy\u2019s very extroverted stage presence, the band would not have gone nearly as far as they did. Tony Iommi wasn\u2019t going to leap around or play guitar with his teeth or do anything gimmicky. So Ozzy commanded, and drew, most of the audience\u2019s attention. Musically, his lack of ability held the band back quite a bit, as evidenced by the enormous leaps forward they made when Ozzy was fired and Tony Iommi got a real singer: Ronnie James Dio, who had not only the god given talent, but formal training, and considerable song writing experience as well. He was just on another level than Ozzy there. He wasn\u2019t in the same category as Ozzy as a showman, true, but not bad, either. So Ozzy focused on his strengths for his solo career, and it worked! He had a great ear for talent for his own band, and his guitarists especially have all turned out to be fantastic. He got better at writing lyrics, and learned how to emerge from the shadow of Tony Iommi. He made metal a much more popular artform, and continued to refine his showman persona in music videos and stage appearances alike. Audiences love Ozzy - they\u2019re not judging him as a great singer, because he doesn\u2019t need to be. ",

            "answer_text": "Ozzy wrote the lyrics to one song: Black Sabbath*. He played the harmonica on The Wizard. He wrote and played the synthesiser parts on Who Are You, (Sabbath Bloody Sabbath). He had a perfect metallic, nasally sounding voice for the music. He looked iconically cool on the Vol. 4 album sleeve.  But most importantly of all, Ozzy came up with all of the vocal melodies for all the songs on the first eight albums (and 13). Hence he gets a writing credit on all the tracks with vocals. He had no musical training and so did it all by having a natural sense of what would sound right for the song. Ozzy was also strongly advised not to get any music theory lessons in case he lost his rare gift of quirky melody as a result of knowing what would be more musically correct. Dio, for example, loathed singing Iron Man because his view was that no trained, musically minded singer would ever sing a melody that followed the guitar riff so closely. Finally, Ozzy was and is a top showman. He knows how to get the crowd going and to make audiences enjoy the night. This is quite a skill, particularly when you think of all the instrumental parts in Black Sabbath's music. A lot of singers would be at a loose end during a long intro or middle section with no vocals. Ozzy would jump up and down and clown around on stage like a crazy nutter (and was under strict instruction from Iommi not to talk during his solos!). *Geezer had a bit of a helping hand in the lyrics to Black Sabbath. It was he who had the vision of a figure in black that points at me that stood at the end of his bed one night in 1969. Geezer wrote the words to all the other songs. Ozzy often and amusingly said of Geezer, in his strong Birmingham accent: \"'Ee's er lyriicle geeneyus.\" And indeed he was. ",

            "answer_text": "Arguably so-so? I\u2019m one of the first people to admit Ozzy Osbourne doesn\u2019t have a great singing voice, but I think this question downplays what Ozzy did for music. While Ozzy isn\u2019t the greatest singer, he\u2019s good enough for what he wanted to do. For Black Sabbath, he was the right singer, in the right place, at the right time. And Black Sabbath wrote some great songs while taking Ozzy\u2019s unique voice into account. Ozzy Osbourne made a great frontman as a member of Black Sabbath, and that is far more important than his individual singing ability.  Enjoy the founders of heavy metal performing in front of a rainbow! Besides his singing voice, Ozzy Osbourne was entertaining to watch when he acted like a charismatic wacko on stage. He also played a bit of harmonica in The Wizard. It fits in well enough, since a lot of Black Sabbath\u2019s best stuff is the blues but louder.  When Rob Halford, an overall more talented singer than Ozzy, covers Black Sabbath, the results just aren\u2019t the same.  And then you have Ozzy Osbourne\u2019s solo material.  Again, even without the greatest voice in the world, he contributed some great rock to the world. And through his solo material, he helped guitarists Randy Rhoads (R.I.P.) and Zakk Wylde get famous. Even beyond the music he personally made, Ozzy contributed to heavy metal by founding Ozzfest. This was a music festival dedicated to hard rock and metal peformers. Lots of famous performers like System of a Down, Linkin Park, and Slipknot have played Ozzfest at some point. It was a great festival for a band to get a big audience. Ozzy Osbourne is an important figure within heavy metal, whether or not you like his \u201carguably so-so voice\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm a firm believer in the idea that you don't need to have a classically good sounding singing voice like those you hear in the cafe playlists or of your dime a dozen YouTube singers. I think humans can appreciate different kinds of singing voices because the voice is the instrument we are most familiar with hearing. We are adaptable to hearing different voices and when we hear the voice, we aren't just hearing the notes; we are hearing the person behind the note. It tells us some things; who they are, where the voice comes from, it gives the voice a personality, etc. I never thought Ozzy had a \u201cgood\u201d voice. His voice however fits the kind of music Black Sabbath made. Try to imagine Black Sabbath but with a voice like Shawn Mendez'\u2026It's just not right, I tell you. Black Sabbath isn't cheery pop music, it's dark, rough. Ozzy's voice captures the rough and rugged style of music they produced. It's the right voice for the right job. It beings a certain gloomy personality to the music that a \u201cgood\u201d singer probably wouldn't. To drive home this point and different kinds of voices being a value in music, listen to \u201cThe Weight\u201d by The Band. In this song, you'll hear 3 different voices. All have a different style to them. One of the voices sounds about as far off from the standard \u201cgood\u201d voice as you can get. It's whimsical, nasally, and fluctuates in a not so smooth kind of oscillating. Then in the chorus you have multiple voices harmonizing. What the use of these voices does for the song is give it a folksy sound to accompany the lyrics. It sounds like you're listening to the stories of ordinary people. Not just some famous singer, but some average folks pulled off the street. Not everyone has a pretty voice, but nonetheless, they are human.  ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with the other fans stating that Ozzy's vocal skill is not the point, his voice is interesting and very distinctive. When he's singing there's some strange effect that grips the listener, if they're in tune with his vibe. Not everyone is. And I'm not trying to exaggerate, but some people have a persona that resonates with others, and sometimes their voices can sort of sift off the vinyl and infiltrate your brain. His voice, and the pain and angst behind it, breaks through in a way that most singers' don't. I don't know, he's doing more than singing, he's digging in. As someone once said you don't have to be perfect, just remarkable. Ozzy is fucking remarkable. And he was the perfect frontman for the group. He is beloved by fans in a way that almost no other rock singer I can think of is/was except for Bon Scott. Obviously there are many other beloved rock singers, Freddie Mercury, Jim Morrison, Kurt Cobain. I'm not trying to list everyone. But Ozzy is a living legend and his fans are different and I think more loyal. Here's, to me, a fascinating early live gig with a fairly tame looking crowd jamming out. Not the look future concert attendees would mimic. ;)  ",

            "answer_text": "Ozzy has a weird charisma that fit the early Sabbath style perfectly. His voice might not have been technically amazing, but again, it had unmistakable personality, and playing off the band\u2019s music and Geezer\u2019s lyrics, it worked perfectly. Later, Sabbath had another winning combination with Ronnie James Dio \u2014 who had one of the most technically amazing voices in rock history. The polar opposite of Ozzy in that regard. IMO, not better in the sense of what it meant for Sabbath, just different. Both Ozzy and Dio had voices that played well off of Tony Iommi\u2019s guitar. And you\u2019ll notice, Iommi used different styles with Ozzy and Dio, matching seamlessly with each singer\u2019s distinct style. I know Sabbath had \u201cother\u201d lineups and singers, but I never paid them much mind. To me, the Ozzy and Dio lineups were the towering achievements of that legendary band. Probably neck-and-neck with Rush for my favorite band of all time. ",

            "answer_text": "Despite the fact that Ozzy technically and in theory is not a very accomplisshed singer, he has an ability to give the music certain mood and tone. It simply fits the music, and it even very often sounds better than with someone who is more advanced singer. And yes, he knows how to use his voice and his range properly, and make them sound good in the end, how to make them fit with a particular sound, right time, right place, right accents. Not all musicians, even very accomplished are always good with that, especially when they are trying to sing or play other peoples songs. Look at Malmsteen, he, is, without a doubt, technically excellent guitarist, and a good composer of his own songs, but with many cover songs his performance simply don\u2019t work, he simply plays too much notes where it is not needed, and adds something where that something is not really needed. If you listen to Ozzy, he feels what is needed for a song very nicely. ",

A siren in this case refers to a mythical creature alive in prosaic stories about poetic beings surmised today to be manatees. But sailors report them to be dangerous creatures that lure other sailors to crash who try to find these singing creatures. Clearly my siren reference is not that far along to being the case! ",

You can hear it on the first 5 records in particular. I got my copy of the 3rd album \u201cMaster of Reality\u201d at 13-14 & still have that same copy to this day. Its probably the most important album in my entire life cuz I've never felt anything like what that record did, & still does, to me. But\u2026 you didn't ask for THAT so I'll keep the one you wanted a bit shorter. Ozzy - he's the fucking dude in the street. Plain & simple. You could relate if you were nothing, because that was what HE was at the time. The dude had jack shit & people knew, \u201chey man, he's one of US!\u201d That's all it was. This fucking realness that cannot be faked. I've always found him to be an incredibly charming guy too that's nearly impossible not to kinda love hahaha.

Being the frontman to arguably Sabbath's prime period of their first four albums (at least) has put a proper face to that period. When certain people think of his contribution, this time invariably comes to mind first, and him having a mediocre singing voice and not a whole lot of real contribution to said material hasn't hurt that view one bit.

I mean ozzy has very unique voice but I bet that also turned away as many people as it attracted. It\u2019s not (at least to me) a very pleasant voice. Nor is it heavy in any way (which might have suited black sabbath). But as a frontman, ozzy managed to make himself a legend. I mean everyone\u2019s heard the story about him biting the bat (even though that apparently didn\u2019t happen). Also with all the tomfoolery with drugs and alcohol he was one of those people who created the stereotypical rockstar image. He was cool. So I\u2019d say that while his singing is not so special, his lifestyle, persona and public image definitely brought a lot of attention and without him the whole black sabbath story would be very different.
