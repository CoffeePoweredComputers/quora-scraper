            "answer_text": "Let me preface this by saying I\u2019m probably one of the biggest Lady Gaga fans in the universe. I still absolutely love her and adore her, but this did leave me feeling quite upset for a while. Shortly after a Star Is Born came out I was at a dive bar in Chicago. One of my friends mentioned he saw Lady Gaga but she\u2019s so tiny I never caught a glimpse of her, well, until the incident happened. A friend of mine had met this guy that looked similar to Bradley Cooper and he was at the bar and people were buying him shots because of the resemblance. We were all pretty tipsy and joking around and we started taking pictures. I asked him to look off to the side because he really looked like Bradley Cooper then. Suddenly I heard a voice from behind me say, \u201cYou\u2019re making him feel uncomfortable.\u201d I turned around and there she was, Lady Gaga. She was not happy with me. The strangest thing happened though. She was about 4 inches from my face and we locked eyes and I couldn\u2019t look away. Neither could she. She asked me if I thought it was funny that I was taking pictures of that guy and I said it was a joke and she just didn\u2019t understand the full story. She seemed totally disgusted with me and I was so frozen. All I could say was, \u201cI swear we were just joking around!\u201d We just kept our eyes locked on each other saying nothing until a group of her friends came up and they walked away. That was completely unlike me. I do not freeze when I see celebrities. And I never got to tell her that I\u2019m seriously one of her biggest fans ever. I stood there frozen for a minute and the bartender said, \u201cHey don\u2019t worry about it, it\u2019s just Lady Gaga and she gets that way sometimes with pictures.\u201d All I wanted to do was cry because I had just gotten scolded by my idol over goofing around with some random guy. I chalked it up to her having a bad day and I\u2019m still going to see her in Vegas quite a few times. Right up front so maybe she\u2019ll recognize me. Because I\u2019m telling you, the way our eyes locked was intense. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course, it's complicated. Start with a couple of Italian Americans, one from New Jersey, and another from West Virginia (there are many Italians from the Ohio River Valley, Dean Martin would be one example). Dad had an older sister who died when she was 19; that woman left an indelible mark on Gaga's family even though she died before Gaga was born. After the marriage, Mom went to work for Verizon and worked her way well up into management over the years. Dad became an entrepreneur, getting rich by installing wifi into hotels. Gaga came along 3 years into the marriage, and the family was wealthy enough to live in New York's ritzy East Side. The family was very Catholic, and Gaga went to Catholic schools. Gaga, the older daughter, was super nerdy, wanted a career in the performing arts, took voice lessons, etc. The kid is off the charts smart. Seriously, Lady Gaga may be the female celebrity with the highest IQ in the world, smarter than Lisa Kudrow (who has written a journal article in the field of neuroloscience) or Mayim Bialik (who has a PhD in neuroscience). Gaga went to what I would call \"nerd camp\" at the Center for Talented Youth, whose alumni include Sergey Brin of Google and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. Remember, at this point in her life she wasn't Lady Gaga, she was just Stephanie Germanotta, rich nerdy musician-singer wannabe at Sacred Heart Convent School. She was bullied by her classmates, who made a point of not inviting her to social events and then mocking her for it. She performed at open mic nights as a teen, was in a couple of school plays, went to NYU for a year and a semester, then dropped out to pursue music full time. While she was at NYU, she was raped by a man 20 years older. It took her a while to process that, but she was determined to not let the incident define her life. Years later, she wrote the song Swine about the incident. She experimented with drugs. She worked as a waitress, a stripper, got to front a metal band. She met Rob Fusari, who helped develop her and build her career. She met Lady Starlight, and started an act with her. About this time, she started billing herself as Lady Gaga. Fusari introduced her to Vincent Herbert, who signed her to Streamline Records. She moved to Los Angeles to work on an album. About 8 months later, The Fame was released. The little nerdy Catholic girl from the East Side had pushed through it all, letting go of everything she had to become a star. She'd broken completely free of the mold of her upbringing, and about the only thing that was left were her powerful ties to her own family. Yes, Joanne is about her long-dead aunt, who she feels a powerful kinship to through her father. She nearly danced her way into a wheelchair for life when she tore her hip during the Born This Way Tour, and kept dancing through the pain, night after night. She had surgery to save the use of her leg (fortunately, completely successful). Where did she choose to recuperate? Her grandmother's house in West Virginia. She gives half of all her earnings to her father (not exactly a stupid move when you consider that he's a multi-millionaire entrepreur, who better to help you manage your money?), and recently bought her parents a Rolls Royce for their wedding anniversary. To Gaga, her fans are a sort of extended family. She spends an extraordinary amount of time talking to them, shaking hands, signing autographs for a celebrity of her stature. If you've ever seen these interactions, that's the sense you get...the little monsters are all like distant cousins, and she's all too happy to play the role of \"Uncle Joe's daughter, the one who is a famous singer and actress\". You want to see the real Lady Gaga? Here it is. It's an act. The act is, \"...and for the encore, I'll yank a fan out of the stands, and they can sit next to me while I play Gypsy.\" That's the act. But what happens after that...well, what you see is what you get.  And yes, she took that little girl down on the elevator and took her backstage at the end of the show. Not to worry, she had a guy pull Mom out of the stands, and mother and daughter were reunited backstage. And of course, Mom, being a little monster, got to spend some quality time with Mama Monster after the show. Because, you know, any fan who would look up video to see what outfit Gaga wore for the encore of the current tour, have a lookalike outfit made for her little daughter, and spend thousands of dollars to get two front row seats in the special section by the stage wing might as well be family. And that is what you do for family. Oh, and Lady Gaga also has fibromyalgia. She's suffered through it since at least 2010, and at one point thought she might have Lupus, which is the disease that killed her aunt Joanne. There have been times when she's come off stage or out of the studio and just collapsed, with a team of therapists tying to do something anything for the pain. And yet, \"the show must go on\", until it gets so bad that she has no choice but to cut a tour short or delay a committment. If you want to get to know her a little better, just watch Five Foot Two. It doesn't tell you everything, it's more of a \"month in the life of Gaga\", but you certainly get a feel for who she is. ",
