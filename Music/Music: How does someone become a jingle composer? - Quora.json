            "answer_text": "This is the road that would lead you to become a full-time jingle composer (meaning somebody who ONLY composes jingles, nothing else): You started out with a lot of dreams. You wanted to be a rock or pop star, with your own band, writing your own songs. Or you wanted to be a classical composer, writing symphonies and such. It doesn\u2019t matter which, but you started to learn about music one way or another, self-taught or at an academy. You had high ambitions. You wanted to live the dream, to be creative, to express yourself in your art.Then you got older and realized you somehow needed to support yourself as a freelance composer. You urgently needed money, so you started looking for other jobs. You did a little film music here, some radio spot there, and then people started to take note that you could deliver easy-listening music that is catchy and well-produced. You got better and better at this. Suddenly you got more and more commercial offers, and you realized you could earn a lot of money with much less work than before. And the money was quick, real, and the royalties didn\u2019t hurt either.The better you got the less time you had. You got better and better offers, but there was also more and more competition. To be on top of your competitors you had to invest a lot in the newest electronic sound equipment for your home studio. Which cost a lot of money, and still does so, as every two years or so your home studio equipment is already antiquated and has to be replaced with the new hotness. As in the jingle business everything is about sound, less about inspiration, you became more and more obsessed with delivering the best sounding product ever.The less time you had the less time you could spend on the stuff that used to be the most fun: writing your own music, your own songs, finding solace in your own inspiration. You became increasingly unhappy, stressed, but on the other hand you had a better life than before, could afford more expensive hotels, cars, travels. Wasn\u2019t that worth it giving up playing for small audiences, for a penny?At some point you simply let go of your former artistic ambitions. It became all about the business, less about the music. It was much easier to forget about your former dreams, as that would hurt too much. Music has become a job like any other job. You deliver, and you are very good at delivering.Sometimes, in the night, you wake up, and with horror you realize that you have become something completely different from what you once wanted to become when you were a kid. And you realize that it is too late to go back. You have ceased to be an artist. You have become a craftsman.Jingle composers who read this may forgive me, but hopefully find some truth in what I wrote. I know many who work in this field, and a lot of what I have written above comes from conversations I had with them. And I have to stress that being a good craftsman is not the worst fate in the world, and also demands respect. On the other hand there are people who are great artists but have also done the odd jingle. But I believe that - not dissimilar to film music - one has to concentrate completely on the commercial aspect of music if one wants to be succesful commercially and be among the top players of this field. So of course not all jingle composers are secretly unhappy. But many are. And to be honest - I myself couldn\u2019t do it. I couldn\u2019t give up the dream. ",

            "answer_text": "You surely don\u2019t need any academic certification to become a jingle composer. All you need is to have a passion along with hands-on skills to write lyrics and give it a proper tone. Now, speaking of professionalism, jingle composition is different than song composition. It is not at all about writing a long literary lyrics and then compose a melodious tone to fit the lyrics in the way it\u2019s done by all the pop stars and film industry music composers. The entire works must speak for one\u2019s business and his services. Let\u2019s take an example of real estate business. Now, when you sit down to write lyrics of a real estate advertisement, you will certainly not talk about your emotional inclinations for somebody you saw at the bus stop. Here, you have to feature the building, your client wants you to promote followed by an attempt to reach out its target audience and finally make them listen to your jingle and click to buy a flat immediately. I hope, now the whole process is loud and clear to you that this is going to be a trade-oriented job. Your lyrical and musical creativity are here to do marketing for any commercial service or products and attract the target audience towards it. If you could do this and make your clients satisfied, you are then an acknowledged jingle composer. Apart from this, if you feel like going through some popular jingles in order to get a tighter grip upon this occupation, then I can recommend you one of the leading jingle companies of Australia \u2013 Brand Music. They are today\u2019 one of premier radio and TV jingles companies in Australia. You don\u2019t need any money to go through their compositions; only a little bit of passion and enthusiasm is enough to push you forward. ",
