            "answer_text": "Both. And more. Although most of his recorded music would be classified under \u201crock\u201d, he played a little bit of everything. Some of his earliest influences were traditional blues and electric blues players. Blues was one of the first styles he practiced long before he became famous. His first ventures into professional playing were in rock and roll and R&B. He wasn\u2019t a front man. He just played guitar in backing bands for the Isley Brothers, Wilson Pickett, Sam Cook, Curtis Knight, and Little Richard. He was already a great player during his time in that role but felt pretty constrained. It wasn\u2019t long before he started to step out and show his true talents. That probably didn\u2019t go over too well with the front men who were used to the spotlight. That\u2019s likely why his career with the Isleys only lasted from 1964-1965, and short times with all the others. He had a brief career as front man in Jimmy James and the Blue Flames playing the same chitlin\u2019 circuit he played with the previous bands. In late 1966 he got his break and was offered a trip to England after being discovered by Linda Kieth who introduced him to Animals bassist Chas Chandler who became interested in being Jimi\u2019s manager. (Thanks to John Horsley for reminding me of a few backing bands I forgot and a few other facts to edit) Even after Jimi became famous as the front man for the Jimi Hendrix Experience, he often played side gigs or jammed with other musicians at clubs or at private residences or studios. He played everything from traditional blues, to jazz, rock, funk, and folk. He mixed in little bit of many styles into his rock recordings. Songs like Red House or Hear My Train A\u2019 Comin\u2019 show his ability and love of blues. Others like Dolly Dagger , little Wing, All Along the Watchtower, or Crosstown Traffic have jazz, funk , and folk influences. Jimi didn\u2019t invent the psychedelic rock genre but his songs such as Third Stone from the Sun, Voodoo Chile (slight return), and Are You Experienced took it to a whole new level. One of the things that made Jimi\u2019s music so good and so interesting was his ability to mesh many styles of music together. He could play any style and often did within the same song. He loved to throw elements of blues, jazz, and funk into his rock songs. Listen to any of his albums and you will hear a mix of styles, but the studio album Electric Lady Land or the live album Band Of Gypsys particularly will display his range and mix of influences. Here\u2019s a little gem. Jimi sharing a little of his talent for traditional blues on an acoustic 12 string.  ",

            "answer_text": "Several answers are saying Jimi Hendrix was \u201ca blues guitarist who played rock\u201d. I\u2019m not really sure what people are trying to communicate by saying that. As a concept, \u201cRock\u201d contains the entire concept of \u201cblues\u201d. What aspect of blues cannot be played in rock? What would make it \u201cnot rock\u201d? The difference is just that rock permits more, it\u2019s more open. Everyone agrees that Hendrix was all about \u201cgoing beyond boundaries\u201d. So, if you go beyond boundaries, and blues is really contained within rock, then aren\u2019t you essentially playing rock? So, I am saying Hendrix was a rock guitarist. While there are rock guitarists who do not display much blues influence (such as Yngwie Malmsteen - The Edge?), probably 99% of them could play blues in a second, because it\u2019s so baked in to rock. (And yes, I\u2019m sure Yngwie can play blues if he wants to, but it\u2019s not a part of his signature sound as I know it). Above, I asked, What makes blues music \u201cnot rock\u201d? I think I would say - if you have someone playing an acoustic guitar, using a slide, in a minimalist arrangement with minimal production, using a strict 12 bar 1\u20134\u20135 kind of structure, then this is getting fairly close to \u201cnot rock\u201d. The more you bring in the typical instrumentation of rock - bass, drums, electric guitar, distortion on the guitar, and breaking the 12 bar 1\u20134\u20135 structure, you are definitely in the \u201crock zone\u201d. As a musician, if you don\u2019t leave that structure behind, at least in maybe half your songs, you will most likely be considered a blues musician. ",
