            "answer_text": "I have small hands. I find the Fender Precision bass awful to play. A short- or medium-scale bass is a good choice, especially when getting started. I spent my first year, way back in the day, on a short-scale Cort \u201cSlammer\u201d. I\u2019ve also owned two Hofner basses, a real 1971 500/1 (the real \u201cBeatle Bass\u201d like McCartney made famous) back before prices got stupid, and now, one of the budget copies that Hofner is making in Vietnam. Decent bass, but with some limitations in sound and feel. Among long-scale basses, my two favorites are Rickenbacker, and the Fender Jazz. The Rick neck is wider, but thinner, the Jazz has a pleasant taper. The Jazz is really comfortable where you\u2019ll play it most, though awfully wide up at the last couple of frets where it joins the body. Ricks also have the advantage of having a neck that is about a half-inch shorter than the full 34 inches of standard long-scale. Doesn\u2019t seem like much, but it does bring the frets just a bit closer together. Unfortunately, Rick prices also got really stupid (particularly used ones) some years back. I got mine before that happened. I\u2019ve played many other basses over the years. Music Man and G&L have very Precision-like necks, so I don\u2019t like them. Ibanez and Warwick are not uncomfortable, but they just don\u2019t do it for me. YMMV. I find Gibson and Epihone Thunderbirds really nice and comfortable. I\u2019m still contemplating an Epiphone Vintage Pro Thunderbird. Now, with small hands, you also need to take care if you want to look beyond four strings. I have a number of 5-strings, but they tend to be ones (like my second Rick) with a narrow string spacing. Essentially, 5 strings on a four string neck. I\u2019ve even got an 8-string, custom made, with about as narrow a neck as is possible. There are a fair number of 5s out there that really aren\u2019t practical for me. I refer to the wider 5+ strings as \u201csurfboards\u201d. 6s are pretty much right out. Now that I\u2019ve been playing so long, I have picked up a 6 in a store, and I can play it, but I don\u2019t really enjoy it. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, scale length really does not matter. I wear size medium gloves, which is pretty small for my height. Use double bass pivot technique, if it works for just about anyone on a 45 3/4\u2033 scale DB it will work on any electric. However, the WIDTH of a bass guitar neck and the relation to the shape of the neck is critical, and that varies a lot. Ibanes SG series basses are good for smaller hands. I also have had good experiences with Cort and Warwick necks. For a six string bass, there\u2019s only one I\u2019ve ever found playable, and that\u2019s a Dingwall ABZ 6\u20133 (yes, I know they\u2019re horribly expensive and hard to get; an NG3 6 string should be pretty similar). Dingwall five strings are phenomenally nice to play as well, short or long scale. ",
