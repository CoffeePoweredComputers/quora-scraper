            "answer_text": "What's the first thing that comes to your mind, when you think of your mother? Her name began as Virginia Lee, born January 1925; friends and family called her everything from Jenny to Ginny Lee. The very first thing I remember is her vanity, her preoccupation with how she looked and to what degree others would admire her. If you were to see photos of her aunts or her mother during the same era, you\u2019d pick up on that vane element of her character at age fourteen.  Memories involve watching Mom sit in front of a mirror, carefully applying makeup, turning her head this way and that, digging through her supply of mascara, foundation, shadow, blush, and all had to coordinate well with her American Indian skin tone and eye color, a brownish olive green. Her hair made her crazy; she\u2019d inherited the thin and fine hair from her maternal family, and she\u2019d have \u201cmade over\u201d every single one of her aunts if they\u2019d let her. Growing up in a poverty-stricken household of aunts and uncles, maternal grandparents, she learned to grasp for things better. Volunteer wheat and other grains grew alongside the roads; she scooped them up and saved them to exchange for money, and with that money she bought fabric to give to her Aunt Mavis to sew school clothes. One pair of shoes a year was bad enough.  Born illegitimate, she never really knew her paternal family, except at 14 she sought out a relative who gave her a photo of her dad. She wore this picture in a locket to the end of her days. So I remember that, among other things, she had regrets and sadness that dated to her premature years and subconsciously carried forward, not all shared with me - some not until the last week before her death.  I remember that she left school and the hardscrabble farm at age 15, got a job, ended up in St. Louis, where she met my dad.   I remember that she didn\u2019t smile much for a posed photograph, but that she\u2019d smile for casual ones.   I remember her being so petite - and that I took after my father\u2019s Polish-Ukranian heritage, the stocky farm-wife body style. The petiteness came from her maternal British heritage; mix that with the skin and cheekbones from the Native Americans; she was a typical, lovely, melting pot of humanity. She was accepting of just about anyone, whatever race, religion, ethnicity, country of origin; she rented her apartments (she owned a nondescript 3-living quarters house) to college students from around the globe.  I remember that we did hug, but it felt \u201cheld back\u201d in a way I can\u2019t explain. When I was in second grade, she still rocked me as my feet dragged the floor. She lay in bed with me till I fell asleep so the monster in the closet wouldn\u2019t get me. She locked my bedroom door so my stepfather couldn\u2019t molest me.  She welcomed all my friends with warmth and jokes and food. She was heartfelt kind to animals, children, needy college kids, old people, abused people, and at the end decided that being around gay people didn\u2019t mean she\u2019d get AIDS.    I remember the smell of her: Tabu perfume, a pleasant body scent, White Shoulders, fabrics and makeup and sometimes what vegetables she\u2019d peeled for dinner. The look of her: laughing at a dirty joke,or a worried countenance, or how her walk changed over the years from spritely to round-shouldered and near lumbering, and her angry look that made me grope for how to react, made my heart pound, and there was the loving and sympathetic look she offered a child or an animal, and the look of deep grief, of disappointment, of regret. So many looks and I can conjure up any single one of them. There was the ghostly image of her crossing her kitchen just as I opened her back door for a visit. I thought at the time, several times, \u201cone day I won\u2019t see her here. Mom will be gone.\u201d Hard to fathom, but I realized it nevertheless:  The sound of her: yeah, the laughing, certain expressions (\u201cwell, I swan\u201d, \u201cbucket of shit\u201d), reverberation from slamming a door or cupboard or just plain \u201cthrowing stuff around\u201d to show how she was feeling or let go the demon that had hold of her that minute, her alto voice attempts to comfort me but that I didn\u2019t \u201csee that way\u201d at the time. The feel of her: such a slight body with my larger boned arms around her, how she tensed up when I gave her a bath during that last week, month, how uncomfortable with her own daughter\u2019s touch - countered by her hands in my child hair, weaving it, snipping at it, and brushing my teeth herself even on trains and in front of whoever languished in the lower level of the El Capitan. I remember a most sad and lovely woman, not totally confident being a mother, desperate to \u201csave\u201d everyone she thought deserving. A woman who so badly wanted to know about her father and possibly meet him (I \u201cfound\u201d him online in 2000, already deceased, but with a half-brother and two half-sisters to \u201cgive\u201d to Ginny Lee, if only for a year or so.) Her brother:  Her first sister:  I remember a woman I needed to please - and failed. I was never the daughter she\u2019d have chosen, given a chance to choose. It\u2019s not that our values were different; it\u2019s that our \u201cexteriors\u201d were so opposite, almost like me being adopted, and that my choices in life - mostly not the best at all - were too similar to her choices - mostly not the best, either, but so different.  I remember, through Mom, that parents aren\u2019t exactly the people who joined ranks to produce you. But at the same time, if those people loved you (and you have to reason that answer out for yourself) then forgiveness is in store - or not. The very last thought I have of Mom was from a dream not long after she moved on. She was sitting to my left on a bench or sofa, leaning forward, interacting with people out of my view. She didn\u2019t look at me; she said nothing to me. But her expression was pleasant, a bit reserved, fairly happy. She looked a lot like this:  Truly, I love you, Mom. I wish you were right here beside me. And I\u2019m so sorry. ",

            "answer_text": "Sacrifice Yes, The amount of sacrifice she has done is what comes to my mind when I first think of her. My mother has sacrificed her happiness, her youth and all her comforts for the sake of her family. She has worked hard and still does for the welfare of her family. She got employed at a public sector bank very young age and dropped off from her college to pursue her government job. She is a hard worker and and very brilliant. She had dreams , she had desires and as she was working ,she even had enough money to enjoy her life the way she wanted to. But instead she chose to be a obedient girl to her parents and listened to them , sacrificing her dreams and desires for them. Little did she know that her whole life would be a sacrifice when she got married. She dropped her promotion offers in order to take care of her kids(As she feared transfer to other cities and leaving her children under others care). She loves her children more than anything in this world. She is a happy and cheerful woman with the courage to face the challenges in this world. Though there wasn't enough support from my dad to the family she managed to setup a business for him when he lost his job. She managed to build a home , buy a car for her family all only through her own efforts. In short she managed the complete home all alone for almost 30+years. My mom has another few months left for her retirement from her job with about 38 years of experience in her career. In all achievements she has done all her life for which she had to come across some rough patches of life, she has never complained of it (the stress or the trouble) at any point of time. She is always well known among her colleagues and the customers of the bank for her kind heart and her helpful nature. All the achievement she has done so far in life includes a lot of sacrifice from her. I'm 24yrs old and still studying. The first thing that I'm going to do after I get employed is taking my mom on a world tour, As this was one her dreams when she was young. I love her the most blessed to have a mom like her. I'm sorry, my answer could have been too long for this question. But I just couldn't stop myself from telling about my mom(in fact this was just a summary :D ) I would like to finish by saying that it is true about the saying that \u201cGod couldn't be everywhere so he created mother's\u201d :D ",
