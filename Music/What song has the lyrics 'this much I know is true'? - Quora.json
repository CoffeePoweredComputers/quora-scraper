The only songs that I can think of that have \"this much I know is true\" in the lyrics are  \"Everyone's Wrong But Me\" by Ella Fitzgerald, and  \"The Broken Road\" by The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Were you thinking of \"I know this much is true\", which apart from being in \"True\" by Spandau Ballet, also appears in \"Set Adrift on Memory Bliss\" by the Backstreet Boys, \"Because You Loved Me\" by Johnny Mathis, \"I Know This Much Is True\" by Donny Osmond, \"Amnesia\" by Britney Spears, and many others ",
