            "answer_text": "Maybe (just maybe!) you should consider the fact that K-pop lyrics are written and sung by native Korean language speakers, and that each word is carefully placed in order to convey a collective thought, not to mention in order to have smooth rhythmic phrasing. \u201cEasy comprehension\u201d by non-native speakers of Korean is not one of the prerequisite criteria for writing lyrics. And just as Snoop Dog doesn\u2019t recite ESL books in his songs, K-pop artists are singing to be relatable to those who already have a full understanding of the intricacies of a language very different from English. As a result, Korean lyrics will often do the following: They include a lot of contemporary slang, and thus contrast greatly with \u201ctextbook Korean\u201d.They regularly use idiomatic expressions (so words themselves have different meanings), along with metaphor and other poetic devices.They often omit grammatical suffixes (since context and syntax is understood as it is sung), omit 1st and 2nd pronouns, and sometimes even leave out the verb of a sentence.They are almost always sung/spoken/rapped in \ubc18\ub9d0/ banmal\u2026 In other words, if one is not able to identify verb infinitives by seeing how they are conjugated into banmal, then a huge majority of words as sung in most K-pop songs will look like \u201cdifferent words\u201d, when they\u2019re just in another form. And on the contrary, nearly all Korean language programs very logically teach students from the very beginning to learn formal forms, then proceed to polite formal, which naturally can then drop the \uc694/yo at the end to form basic banmal, not the other way around. To use an extreme example, I don\u2019t think any of us would give a chef a rice cooker, asking him/her to teach you how to grow rice in a field.With the above in mind, also ask yourself this question: If the lyrics to K-pop songs are really written and sung by native speakers of Korean, then could it possibly be that I will need to not only learn the dictionary definitions of a great number of words, but also have at least an intermediate knowledge of more difficult vocabulary and grammatical forms that the native-speaking Korean population would understand, in order to figure out what\u2019s being sung? In sum, if I may respectfully speak directly and just simplify the issue: If the words are \u201cdifferent\u201d, it\u2019s because you simply haven\u2019t learned them yet. Keep up your studies, build your knowledge of grammar and vocabulary, and don\u2019t let difficulty in understanding K-pop lyrics in the original language discourage you\u2026it will just take time.

            "answer_text": "Well first of all, K-pop songs use very casual words and phrases. You wouldn't want to use those with people who you aren't close with (strangers, acquaintances, etc), or people who are older/of a higher ranking than you. In some songs you'll hear the occasional \u2018\uc694\u2019, buy it's not very common. Secondly, they tend to use a lot of trendy words/slang. Most people wouldn't talk like this. Maybe if you were talking/goofing off with your friends. (If you and your friends are teens. Older people don't typically use trendy words/slang. But, hey. To each their own. There might be some hip Korean grandmas out there.) So yeah. Very casual words and phrases/grammar. And a lot of slang. I hope this helped! ",
