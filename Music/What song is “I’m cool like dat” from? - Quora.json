            "answer_text": "Rebirth of Slick (Cool like dat) by Digable Planets. The album is called Reachin' (A New Refutation of Space and Time). It is some top shelf early 90's rap, and is an album worth sitting down and listening to. Also make fantastic late party music, when everyone is drunk and just sitting around shooting the breeze. Lots of Afrofuturism has a Reachin' feel to it. Digable Planets never really matched their debut and only made three albums. This was partially due to industry bs. Ladybug Mecca, was one of the keys to the Digable sound and signed some solo deals that meant she couldn't perform in the group. Mr. Butterfly would resurface a few years back in Shabazz Palaces, which incorporates a lot more jazz theory, where Digable Planets was just inspired by jazz. I respect Shabazz Palaces, but don't really play it much. Reachin\u2019 is an easy 4.5 out of 5 star album by my count. ",
