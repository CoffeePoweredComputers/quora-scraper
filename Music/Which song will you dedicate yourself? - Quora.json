            "answer_text": "When it comes to dedicating a song for myself(which literally no one does.\u2026\u2026like, ever!), i guess I'd dedicate either Halsey\u2019s \u2018sorry\u2019 or Shawn Mendes' \u2018life of the party\u2019. \u2018Sorry\u2019, because i feel our generation can get really confused and a bit overwhelmed when it comes to love. It's not a simple logic like it was for our parents, now a days finding love is like finding a unicorn. So even when you do encounter love you just don't have time for it or you don't even recognize it. \u2018Life of the party\u2019 one the other hand is the type of song that tells you that it's fine to be human, to be you. As the lyrics read, \u201cWe don\u2019t have to be ordinaryMake your best mistakes\u2018Cause we don\u2019t have the time to be sorrySo baby be the life of the party\u201d,the song allows you to be stupid, nervous, weird and impulsive, which is in my opinion somthing every one needs to be told once in a while. So yeah, those are my dedications to myself (still a creepy idea)  ",
