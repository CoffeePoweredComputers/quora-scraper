            "answer_text": "There are a few different reasons that an orchestra \u2014 or an opera, or a ballet, or a theatre company \u2014 publishes program guides. At the most practical level, the purpose of these books is twofold: They provide space which advertisers can purchase, an important revenue source for such organizationsThey acknowledge major donations and sponsorships, providing name and/or brand recognition to those who support the institution through donations, a huge and crucial source of incomeA nice side effect is that we also get to help educate the audience about the music and the musicians, and to advertise our own upcoming events, of course. All of that is important stuff; writing engaging, well-researched program notes is one of the fun things I get to do. But in practical terms, program notes are not at all the primary purpose of a program guide. It\u2019s about the money, to a large extent \u2014 which is why we aim to print slick, magazine-quality materials, expensive as they are, since this upscale presentation is more attractive to those we hope will purchase some real estate within.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll take this to mean \u201cwhy do symphony venues make program books\u201d The answer is, not everyone who attends a concert knows a lot about the music to be played, the composer(s), or the performers. The program contains data on all this. And since most people try to attend a concert early (once doors close, you can\u2019t take your seat until the interval), there is a time gap most people spend browsing the program. I hope this is not confused with the existence of \u201cprogram symphonies\u201d, which is a completely different animal. In a nutshell, most instrumental symphonies written before the 1830s are \u201cabstract\u201d, meaning, they are just music, not meant to depict a narrative. At most, some are \u201clandscapes\u201d, such as Vivaldi\u2019s \u201cThe Four Seasons\u201d (not a symphony, but a series of concertos), where we \u201chear\u201d storms, rain, birds, etc. But in the 1830s, French composer Hector Berlioz came up with the idea of a \u201cprogram symphony\u201d, where the music would depict a sequence of events, basically a plot, or a program. Many symphonies written after him follow this outline, and as such, do have a plot, which is often included with the program notes. ",
