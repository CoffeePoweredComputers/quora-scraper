            "answer_text": "Hi, In my opinion, by listening to every music genres and comparing to pop music, I would say the major points for a number 1 hit song are:  1- Consonance. If you listen to a lot of pop songs, you will find that most of them have similar harmonics and similar progressions. For example, this guy sings 22 popular songs with the same four guitar chords:    When you listen to other types of music, like radiohead or flying lotus as examples, you will hear more dissonance (inharmonious or harsh sound; discord; cacophony.), anormal instruments, new synthesized sounds or just things your ear isn't used to listen to. In most cases, you will have to listen to it over and over again to like it. By experience, the more you listen to a new genre, the more you like it because your ear gets used to the songs and the style and your brain makes concord in what was, at first, discord. Your brain has to ''understand' what it is listening to.  2-Also, it was proven that consonance is more often subjective, conventional and cultural. Which proves that music sounds good because you have been used to listening too the same kind of songs over and over again at the radio. That's why every country has its cultural music which sounds weird to foreign countries.  3-I also think that lyrics have a major role to play. In fact, a song that everyone can relate to is more likely to be a number one hit. For example, a love song or a song about happiness is an easy, but good choice if you want people to relate to hit. Lyrics have to be pretty easy to get (not every good songs have easy lyrics thought) and not to elaborated so anyone can understand it. Also, lyrics have to be made to be played on the radio (not vulgar, not TOO deep, not TOO depressive) otherwise,  a song would never get to the top.  4- Moreover,  ''feel-good'' songs are more likely to get to the top because people listening to the radio often want to turn off there brain from the usual stress and just relax to nice and easy music. 5-Finally, artists just listen to what's trending at the moment and do the same, because they know this is how they will get their songs to the top.  For example, Martin Garrix animals made it to number one in 2013. After that, many artists used the same sounds (in that example, it's the ''kick-bass'' in the back that created the big-room style) and same structure to ''copy'' that song. Here is the example:       ",

            "answer_text": "You want to know the secrets my young grasshopper? -The Pop genre generally uses 4 chords (Jazz typically uses 3, Classical uses 2). These chords are the 1, 5, 6 and 4 chords in the respective scale. -Structure your song by either starting with a chorus or getting to the chorus within 20ish seconds...but this first chorus should be simpler then the actual chorus that will be happening soon. Next do a verse then a pre-chorus then hit them with your full on chorus (it should have more instruments then the first one). Do a verse, pre-chorus, chorus again then give them a bridge. After the bridge do a double-super emotional final chorus where the singer sounds like he/she is in the most important moment of their life. Then you do the outro. -Make sure the singer is one of the most amazing singers you have ever heard and then make them even more awesome by tuning their vocals to perfect pitch. -Make sure the song carries a very, very simple message that sounds deep if you don't think about it. Meghan Trainor wants you to know fat girls are cute too, Taylor Swift wants you to know that relationships suck and so on and so on. -Make the instrumental sound cool and unique. It should sound good quiet and loud. -It also has to be a really good song...like insanely good. You have to convince millions of people to like it before it becomes number 1. ",
