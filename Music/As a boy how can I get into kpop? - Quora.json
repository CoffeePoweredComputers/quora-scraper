            "answer_text": "Well, I think gender does not really matter as long as you like something without reprecussions given by others. You could start watching their Music Videos. And from there, switch to variety shows that makes you see their personalities so that you can get to know them better. If you are into dancing videos, you could search their Fancam to appreciate your chosen bias (a person who you stan out of the group you enjoy). Or their dance covers to other artist\u2019s song. This may take days, weeks, or years. But don\u2019t be pressured into going into something just because majority of your peers like something. That being said, being a boy doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t like something. You could stream their dance videos all you want and still be an honorable meber of the society. I had a friend who\u2019s into Ateez. He enjoys them so much to the point that he recruited many of his male friends to dance to \u201cHala Hala\u201d and \u201cWonderland\u201d just for fun. They were proud that they attracted attention through it, and thus, continued to enjoy Ateez. (His bias is San, by the way. In my friend\u2019s dance team, he said that San inspired him to give his 100% in dancing with facial expressions) So in short, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a girl or a boy. Just do what you love. I hope I answered your question, my friend. Have a nice day! ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, gender doesn\u2019t matter. You can get into K-pop as a girl, boy, non-binary, etc. Second of all, from what I see, boys tend to prefer girl groups over boy groups. I don\u2019t know why, but maybe it\u2019s because girls are more appealing for boys (maybe not all boys, but a lot that I\u2019ve known). You could check out Red Velvet to begin with. I recommend their happier stuff first like Red Flavor, Umpah Umpah and Happiness first. Later, you can go to their sexier concepts which would be Bad Boy, Psycho and Be Natural.  I also recommend TWICE. Their songs are catchy and fun and the girls are beautiful. Feel Special is a good song to listen to. I also suggest What Is Love, Fancy and Likey.  Finally, I recommend Dreamcatcher. They have a very anime opening vibe and I know that most people (that I\u2019ve met) would prefer anime over K-pop any day. My favourite title track by them has got to be Piri so you should go check that out. They also released their first full album called \u201dThe Tree Of Language: Dystopia\u201d, which is FILLED with bops!  Enjoy the quarantine, Eni <3 ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly, it doesn't matter. (You don't have to be romantically attracted to them.) If you're totally new, just head on over to youtube and search up some of those most popular/well-known groups such as Bts, Blackpink, Exo, Twice, etc. or some recently debuted groups like Ateez, Stray Kids, Txt, etc. and take a look at some of those official music videos! If something catches your eye, search up \u201cguide to [group name]\u201d and you get introduced to the lovely personalities of said group. You'll learn about everything- terms, ethics, traditions, media in no time! There are also plenty of wonderful, helpful, and kind people out there that will be more than happy to help you get into their favorite group. ",

            "answer_text": "get to know some girl groups maybe? back in primary school i had a lot of male classmates who disliked kpop as they thought that kpop was only for girls and was a very \"gay\" thing. when i went to secondary school i found out that actually a lot of older boys, teenage boys and even young adults like kpop. for the males they usually stan groups like TWICE who's concepts appeal to them. if you're just starting to get into kpop, it depends on the type of concept you like and the type of group, music you like. some groups are stronger in rap, thus they have more rap parts but some are stronger in vocals and tend to have more vocal parts.
