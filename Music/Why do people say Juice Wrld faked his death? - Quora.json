This was a popular Tik Tok trend, only weeks before he died. And of course\u2026  That. The first time I have ever listened to Juice Wrld was when I listened through one of those black and white Bart Simpson slow w/ reverb videos. Typical edge. Anyways, I was around before Juice blew up, and I kinda just stuck with him throughout his career. By no means was I a die-hard fan, but I was saddened to hear the news. I remember that shit was going around the internet about him getting shot, and after that, I was thinking that his life was on a timer. Emo rappers go really young\u2026 RIP Juice Wrld. I hope he really did fake it. If not, I hope he is in a better place. ",
