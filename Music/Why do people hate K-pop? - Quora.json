            "answer_text": "It is not news that the KPOP community is a very enthusiastic one. This should implyhow good these artists are, but with statistics, KPOP isn't exactly accepted in the western world.I can relate to why people might dislike KPOP because I was in their shoes. These were my reasons.1. The fanbase: I knew people who loved KPOP...... a lot! They were so engrossed in it, that they mostly talked about it like their life relied on it. Of course, it's not wrong to be enthusiastic about yourfavourite artist, in every sphere of music there are good artists with a large fanbase, but for KPOP, the majority arejust keep screaming and dying.... like take a chill pill guys, they are just artists.2. Gay males: Their male artists seemed very gay.... I used to watch korean series, and my last was Boys over Flowers.The day I watched that series, was the day I lost all hope for Korean series, because it's just TOO affectionate andsoft, it's almost gay to be that romantic. It has no manly touch, (except City Hunter, i was impressed).3. Awkward costumes: They dressed in glitter and shiny stuff, with different color combinations that are abnormal.Sometimes it's creative and artistic (try F(x) Red Light), but sometimes it's just outright unrelatable (SNSD I got a Boy)4. Indecent dance styles: I don't have to say much on this, just watch Stellar's Marionette.I still have these views of KPOP, but I've also found a reason to appreciate KPOP, so why be negative.The KPOP community kind of represents itself to the foreign world as the hormone-driven, blushing and soft teenagekind. Please note, not all of us are like that. I speak for myself, and those I know of. ",

Yes, there are people who just hate everything that's on the screens or papers or anything that a lot of people like.Weird. \u201cWatching asians sing while intensely dancing in bright flashy lights, that's so weird!1!\u201dLooks gay. *Sighs*\u201cMy ex used to listen to that crap.\u201dI know, as a person who's been into kpop for a long time, you will stumble upon a lot of people who use dumb excuses to hate it and it will frustrate you a lot. But don't worry, it's not like it'd make a difference, they're just missing out on something cool, right? Anyways, thanks for asking and I hope you have a nice day! ",
