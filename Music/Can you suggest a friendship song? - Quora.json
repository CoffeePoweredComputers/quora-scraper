            "answer_text": "This was 1999. I was 9 Years old. I was on a vacation to my grandparents at Mumbai. Every single day it was a kind of ritual to have lunch and then quietly sneak out in the common balcony of our house in the chawl (different flats sharing the same balcony) system while all the elders get to snoring as loud as possible. The games start with \u201ckitchen set\u201d, \u201cfake shooting\u201d, \u201chide and seek\u201d, etc. but when its just me and my friend Netra, we spent our days, dancing and singing, specially on \u201cKeh do na, Keh do Na, You are my soniya\u201d, One trending song during that time. This is 2018. The same song still rings in my head, i can still see the memory of us laughing till our stomach hurted. Hugging each other, Waiting for each vacation desparately to see her. It would have been the same. I wish! But Maturity took all of it from both of us. She shifted to some other place for a couple of years. I could never meet her during my summer vacations. But then there was a day when she was back in the same building. However, this time it was different. All the excitement I had vanished when i saw her. It was the feeling of rejection. She behaved in a really formal way. Hello, Hi, ok Bye. I was extremely puzzled. I couldnt understand where the innocence and the love had disappeared. My best friend may have changed, but those memories are still alive and fresh in my mind. And it has been my prized possession since then. ",

Life is my Yellow brick road. And the dark forces of life have indeed tried to ruin my Yellow brick road. But\u2026. My wife repaired it and delivered me to the Emerald city! She guides me along my Yellow brick road beautifully and so my life is perfect. It doesn't matter what bumps appear in the road, she fixes it with her constant love and warmth and I never stop appreciating this in her. I am lucky to have found her. My life is the Emerald city thanks to her!  Please do listen now to \u201cYellow Brick Road\u201d (free download for all fellow Quorans!) I hope you enjoy it!
