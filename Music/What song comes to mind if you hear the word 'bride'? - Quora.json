            "answer_text": "Thank you Andrew! I've got the perfect song and I'd bet you never heard of it. It's not one of my old country classics it's a song by a one-hit wonder, a cat named Nick Lowe who you might remember as the dude who sang Cruel to be Kind, which I think of as an anthem. Sometimes, to get rid of someone, one must be cruel to get their point across, because nicely asking someone who loves you to leave you alone, rarely works. But as the song says \u201cin the right measure\u201d don't overdo it. Sorry, sidetracked. Bride song, huh? As I said before, it's by Nick Lowe, a song called I Knew The Bride. I found this song while I was working on the playlist for my daughter's wedding. I'd never heard it before but after one listen, I knew my daughter would love it. It tells a cute little story and its got a great beat so it's very easy to dance to. I'm still working on a few of your other questions, just give me time. I've always said \u201cGive me your situation, and I'll play you a song about it\u201d. It's usually a country song but this time it's not. While looking for this video, I found that Huey Lewis did a cover of this song. I like the original better.  This song reminds me of my daughter and I'm going through the \u201cempty nest\u201d syndrome and I really miss the bride. She's gone from being my daughter to his wife and I miss the girl who used to love to dance with me. I hope you enjoy. ",
