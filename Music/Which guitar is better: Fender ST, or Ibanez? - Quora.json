            "answer_text": "Both are great guitars. It all depends on which one suits your style of playing and is comfortable for you Fender Strats have been used in all forms of music from Jazz to Rock to even Heavy Metal. The great thing about them is they are versatile and you can use them wherever you want. Srats are considered one of the four gods of guitar brands along with the Telecaster, SG and Les Paul. They have been prefferred by some of the greatest guitarists ever like Hendrix, Clapton, Blackmore etc . One of the most beautiful things about a Strat is the moveable bridge which enables you to directly attach a whammy bar without any kind of complicated setup. A major disadvantage lies in the single coil pickups which tend to be noisy . However nowadays hum cancelling pickups have been developed which reduce the noise . The single coil pickups also have an advantage as they produce that distinctive Stratty sound which you cant easily get on other guitars Ibanez is known for being a metal guitar. This killer machine was built exclusively for metal but that doesnt mean you cant play other styles on it! Ibanez guitars are known for what I would call easy shreddability which means you can perform fast legato runs and sweep picking much easily compared to other guitars. This is the reason why Ibanez is preffered by guitarists who have a very speed intensive style of playing like Steve Vai . Unlike the strat , the Ibanez usually has ateast two humucker pickups (the third may be single coil). It is known for being able to produce a distinctively heavy sound. Now though the Ibanez does not have a floating bridge like a strat you can attach what is known as a Floyd Rose system which I assure you is way better than the simple fender Tremolo mainly due to the fact that it is super strong and wont break I hope you now have a better insight into both of these guitars and can make a better choice now. I would suggest you go to a store and try both of them and then select the one you feel best for you Happy guitar playing :) ",

            "answer_text": "Both are unique, however I personally prefer Ibanez, I'll list some points. Ibanez is lighter, easier to play, allowing fast riffs, and clean solos. I personally love any Joe Satriani custom Ibanez. The lighter weight means less wood, and less sustain, this makes a clean sound, but it may lack personality... However it handles effects beautifully! Fender is very versatile, from rock, country, and even the orchestra! It isn't to bulky, or to light, it's sound is clean with a distinct touch no other guitar has. However I'm not a huge fan of their natural pickups, and recommend modifying it. All guitars are different, and all guitarist play differently. ",
