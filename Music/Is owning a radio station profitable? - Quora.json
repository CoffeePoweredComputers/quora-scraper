            "answer_text": "\u201cIs owning a radio station profitable?\u201d As others have said, it usually is, or there wouldn\u2019t be any commercial stations. It varies, on lots of things. AM stations are very hard to make profitable. Most large-market AM stations are part of a local group, and are, essentially, subsidized by the profitable FM stations in the group. There ARE exceptions, of course, but these are always programmed in a small niche in the area. Foreign language stations are the best example. In my area (Seattle-Tacoma), KKMO (Spanish), KSUH (Korean), and KXPA (multicultural blocks) are good examples. Business talk and sports are two more. In California, there\u2019s a largely progressive stand-alone in San Bernardino (KCAA) that has been doing well enough, that they just this month moved into a nice new studio facility. The owner is a single person who is a large part of the management team, even though he lives in Texas (Fred Lundgren \u2014 ceo@kcaa,com). He wouldn\u2019t be able to do it, if it wasn\u2019t for the web. Small-market mom-and-pop stations can be successful, especially if the station is a big part of the local community. Agriculture, high school sports, community activities and such are always important there. I have also been involved with many stations that have gone through a lot of ownership changes and bankruptcies\u2026 usually with piss-poor management. Poor managers don\u2019t usually last long. Unfortunately, they usually take a lot of good people down with them. Before the days of instant banking, it was always a race to see who get could their paychecks cashed at the bank before the checks started bouncing. When I was a GM, I made it a point to never hire somebody until I KNEW we could meet taxes and payroll (in that order). For a while, it meant that I was the only employee! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but you need to be, or have a great Station Manager to do it. And by that I don\u2019t me \u201cyay, I love radio and music\u201d, I actually mean a great businessman. Fortunately for the last 13 yrs I\u2019ve worked along side one such guy, who is not only a great businessman, but also a seasoned radio veteran. As well as working at notable nation stations, and along side some of the legends of the industry, he is also an incredible businessman, which has no doubt helped him in his current position as Project & Station Manager. Another thing radio stations need to do, and some don\u2019t, is to embrace diverse ways to build and audience, and generate revenue. Many stations can learn a great deal from online marketers and entrepreneurs like Pat Flynn, Chris Ducker, and the great Gary Vaynerchuk. Integrating there wisdom and tips into a modern radio station workflow, could mean the difference between success, and failure. Because in these modern times you can\u2019t expect the audience to come to you, you need to go to them first. Hope that helps. ",
