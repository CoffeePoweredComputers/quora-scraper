            "answer_text": "BTS is not overrated. BTS IS overhyped. (overhyped - make exaggerated claims about smth) BTS worked hard, had great music, Mvs, meaningful lyrics, and deserved to be popular. However, currently they are overhyped. They are promoted excessively. Anywhere they are mentioned, or Bighit and TxT now, people faint over how good they are, and no one would dare to say otherwise because they will get furious Army backlash. But most of the hype comes from their fandom. Armys tend to exaggarate everthing they to make them godlike. First, they tend to shove their \u201cunderdog\u201d journey down your throats. They are presented like the only group that ever struggled (homeless people have nothing on them), and the world was against them, but they strived with best angelic vocals and best dance, and best rap EVER. Also, they are THE ONLY group that has meaningful lyrics - even \u201cUrsoo, it\u2019s awesome ohohoho bum badum bum brrumble\u201d has some deep meaning on Hemingway level that others are just too dumb to understand, they helped everyone with depression because evidently every other person has diagnosed despression disorder (no, depression isn\u2019t feeling sad when your boyfriend breaks up with you, or you don\u2019t have many friends, or you get bad grade, it is a serious ilness) and they are so good they are compared with The Beatles and Queen (don\u2019t even go there) , they are the smartest people that exist,.. Every little thing they do is elevated to insane levels - if they bring a f** chair to someone, you have thousads of articles about it as if they cured cancer.. it\u2019s a f** chair, it\u2019s normal behaviour and not sacrifice for humanity, If they dance on performance, they saved the whole show which otherwise is boring. If they take a selfy, they are Korean Erik Almas. No they don\u2019t make their own music by themselves, they don\u2019t write their own speeches, they didn\u2019t cure depression in world, they certainly don\u2019t have the best vocals, they are not geniouses for putting hints in their comebacks and Armys are not intellectuals for making theories. Don\u2019t get me wrong, they should be appreciated for all these things but in the extent they did accomplish, because they should be appreciated for who they are, without unecessary enchantments, because who they are is amazing.

            "answer_text": "Wow. I looked at the comments and answers from most of the other people and honestly I\u2019m disappointed. Please, hear me out. First and foremost, I\u2019d like to say the members were so poor at one point they shared one chicken breast between the seven of them and had to all share one tiny room. The company had no money so Seokjin, being the only member from a decently well-off family, used all his allowance to buy the other members food and necessities. Still, members like Yoongi had to choose between dinner and a bus ticket, so he often skipped meals - causing him to become extremely malnourished in the long run. Are we all forgetting times such as when Taehyung\u2019s grandmother died, yet instead of sympathy, was told he should\u2019ve died alongside her? He has since lost his grandfather and his best friend also suicided in 2017. Or the time, Yoongi was hit by a car and permanently damaged his shoulder, yet didn\u2019t tell anyone for the fear of being kicked out of the company? The time when Namjoon and Yoongi were disrespected face to face by an underground rapper, but BigHit being the small company it was back then, could do nothing about it. The time there was a death threat sent against Jimin in a concert, yet Seokjin being a selfless human being wore the exact same clothes as Jimin so the killer would shoot him first. When all the times bts had the tiniest ounce of rise in fame, they were slandered, accused of copying the most trivial things such as hair colours and concepts, had almost successful petitions signed against them to stop them from winning any awards? Just because fans of the more popular groups felt threatened by the fact that their fave wouldn\u2019t stay at the top. When #PlagiarismBoys trended no.1 in South Korea, falsely accusing the boys of sajaegi, when in reality bts and BigHit were at the point of bankruptcy that they could barely afford living necessities - let alone chart topping methods. When locals in South Korea ridiculed Jimin and called him a fat pig. Why? Because he had a bloated face. This caused him to starve himself to the point where he collapsed several times in dance practices / award shows / performances. When Namjoon, being the group\u2019s leader began suffering from depression after bts began receiving immense amounts of hate. How Yoongi has suffered from depression, social anxiety and OCD since pre-debut, due to poverty and unsupportive parents. How Jungkook bottled up his feelings for so many years, in fear he would become an even bigger burden towards the group, after the immense hate they were receiving. When Jimin was being bullied at school for not following the freshman rules. Thankfully Taehyung stepped in and defended him. When antis trended a hashtag petitioning to kick Hoseok out of bts because he was deemed \u2018too ugly\u2019. Shortly after it died down, another hashtag trended to kick out both Seokjin along with him, as Jin was deemed \u2018talentless\u2019. I won\u2019t even start on how badly bts in general were treated by the Korean media. They were publicly ridiculed and looked down upon during many shows in which they attended. In addition, much of their award show performances were either shortened or never posted at all. As if all of that isn\u2019t enough, they now have to deal with false stereotypes, immense racism and close-minded people against them in the western market. Now as for dance, vocal and rap skill, I won\u2019t get into that because my answer is already abnormally long. Just know that Jungkook can hit an F5 note, Yoongi can rap 11.5 syllables per second and that Jimin was so good at dancing, his instructor didn\u2019t make him pay to attend the arts school. Edit : Hoseok is also the second best dancer in Kpop - in an unbiased ranking by a computer, only he and Taemin got a score above 90%. If you are a non kpop fan reading this : No, none of the members are gay, they have all had girlfriends / crushes before. They are not plastic, none of them have had plastic surgery except for RM - but that was because he had a medical condition and couldn\u2019t breathe properly. They don\u2019t write sappy love generic pop songs - I only actually know about 5 out of the approximately 150 songs they have produced to be about love. The others deal with serious issues such as mental health and some are about their personal struggles. If you were to look closer, they have a storyline which runs throughout all of their albums - ever since the very beginning. They aren\u2019t manufactured, which seems to be the stereotype that runs around kpop. BigHit were far too poor to do that. They do in fact self- produce about 99% of their work. The majority of the fandom ( 27% ) are between 40 - 50, not 12 year old screaming fan girls. If you are a kpop fan reading this, I assume you are doing so because you feel that your fave deserves more success than bts: Firstly I hope my answer may have changed your perception on bts a little. If not, I\u2019d advise you to stop being immature and start focusing more on supporting your own group instead of hating bts. Just leave them alone, they haven\u2019t done anything to you. Why is it so bad that bts broke into the western market? They bring in more recognition and success for kpop in general. Besides, if it makes you feel any better, I hope you realise how hated they are throughout America. Just go on Twitter if you want to see. Be glad your group isn\u2019t put through the same stupidity. In all honesty, you should be more supportive towards bts\u2019s rise to fame. It means they bring in more for your own faves as well, so unless you want your group to be kept unknown and in the shadows, I suggest you let bts get back to work. I apologise for this long answer, I got carried away. If you are still here, then I sincerely applaud you. If you still decide to mindlessly hate bts for no reason at all, then you do you I guess. The internet is an area free for different opinions to be spoken out - it\u2019s not like I can stop you from doing that. ~Yoona ",
