            "answer_text": "If you have ever seen an elephant , you would know that some elephants have a pair of teeth tusks , which are not used for chewing the food . Now , the proverb means that \u201cElephants have different teeth for eating and different ones for showing \u201c , it just shows that some people tend to fake being someone they are not . For example : When you think of air hostess\u2019 , you feel like they have an easy job , they get to travel the world for free and get paid now these are dikhane ke daant , But their job isn\u2019t that easy , they have to manage hundreds of people , clean the plane after landing including the rest rooms , and these are khaane ke daant . Hope it helps :) ",

            "answer_text": "What we can see from a picture of elephant?  we can see the teeth. But elephant doesn't use it to eat. This is for his safety. But the function of tooth is to chew food. He has another set of tooth to eat. Here first part of the dialogue \"hathi ke daant khane ke aur\u201d means elephant has different set of tooth to eat and the second part of the dialogue \u201cdikhane ke aur\u201d means another set to show. It is a proverb. Which people used to say when, someone show something which is not true but do opposite in the behind. It is said towards double faced people. Hope I can make you understand. Thanks.
