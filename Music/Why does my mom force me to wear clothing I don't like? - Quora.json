Or, she thinks your choice of colour, design and choice of style are not modern and fashionable or suited to your complexion and figure. Tastes differ. You are free to dress the way you like so long as it looks decent and graceful. ",

Maybe she thinks you\u2019re not dressing in a way that suits your figure and your age. Maybe she thinks that the colors and styles you choose are wrong for you and don\u2019t flatter you. ",
