            "answer_text": "Yes, however you will have to purchase the right to sell the download (or stream). Most likely you will need to go to The Harry Fox Agency to get the proper permissions. There are services that will handle the administrative end and make simplify the legalities of it. I used a company called \u201cLimelight\u201d for a cover I did with Streetlab of \u201cBlister in the Sun\u201d. For a set fee, you will purchase a set amount of streams/downloads upfront. You may find in the long haul it might be more profitable to give your covers away for free and sell your originals. Good Luck! ",

But you asked about Spotify and that\u2019s actually even easier. Both Spotify and Deezer pay for their own licenses for cover songs. This means that you can distribute your covers to both of these services worldwide. But it requires you put in the correct metadata for your release so that Spotify can identify the owner and pay them. Oh, and of course you cannot use any samples or backing tracks unless they are your original work or you have the licenses/permissions required to use it. ",
