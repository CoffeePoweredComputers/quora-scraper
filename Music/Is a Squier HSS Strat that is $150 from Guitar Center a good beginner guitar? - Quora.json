            "answer_text": "A Squier HSS Strat is not only an excellent beginner guitar but a good guitar for any musician. First, let me explain why it's good for a beginner: it is a guitar of a good reputation that is made in a good factory under fairly good quality control standards for Fender Musical Instruments. Secondly, it will have a wider variety of sound available to it in my opinion than a normal Stratocaster would because of the hunbucker pick up in the bridge position. The HSS configuration is one of my favorite pick up configurations on a guitar because you have the great fender neck middle and out of phase positions coupled with a more aggressive bridge pick up. It should be made with decent quality components in and when set up properly to a player\u2019s creature comforts (string gauge and height/action) it should provide many years of good service. In fact it should serve its owner long enough to become a good instrument for a player of any level as I mentioned before. Here's how: A Squier guitar is easily customizable with higher quality parts and when you know what size and what material you need to replace things with. For instance, the bridge on a squire may be Slightly smaller than a fender bridge but you can buy bridges of better quality that will fit a Squire . You can also upgrade the pick ups and various other electronics to higher quality pickups from companies such as Seymour Duncan, DiMarzio or Warmoth. You can upgrade the tuning keys with pieces from Schaller, Gotoh, Grover or Sperzel. You can even use locking tuners. Companies like Hipshot, Schaller, Gotoh and many others to make bridges and various other pieces of hardware like locking strap buttons that not only improve the performance of your guitar bur can protect it at the same time. All of this potential in an instrument that usually comes at a price under $200. That's a hard deal to beat. So by all means take a moment at your local guitar store and sit down and play the Squire stratocaster and make sure it fits you and the vision for your music. Don't be afraid to try any of the inexpensive versions from Epiphone, Ibanes or LTD/ESP either. You may find something that moves your soul better than the Squire for around the same amount of money. But yes, to answer the original question, a Squire HSS Strat is an all-around great guitar that is excellent for a beginner. ",

            "answer_text": "I have both a Chinese-made Squier HSS Strat and a Mexican-built Fender HSS Strat. I had the Mexi Strata first and then bought the Squier to practice on. I am a guitarist of low technical skill but sound really matters to me. I get pretty much the same sound out of both guitars. I really like the second-to-bottom switch position combining the bridge (H) and middle (S) pickups, a crunch you can\u2019t get from the regular SSS configuration. There are definitely differences between the two instruments but the Squier is pretty good at my level and fantastic value for money. However the Squier is not quite as well made as the Mexican Strat. The fit and finish of the components is not as clean; the pickguard is a bit buckled for example and the neck doesn\u2019t feel as fast to me. The paint is not as lustrous I would say but they\u2019re not the same color so that\u2019s harder to judge. My Squier doesn\u2019t stay in tune as long as the Mexican-built HSS, but it feels good to me to play and the neck seems straight enough. The dude at Starving Musician where I bought the Squier told me they are good-enough guitars on average but may not be consistent from one unit to another, e.g. the pickups may vary in output level from guitar to guitar of the same type where a more expensive model they would be more closely matched. So far that reason, don\u2019t buy online - try out the exact one you want in the store. I have also played a bit on a US-built Standard Strat ($1100) and it feels better still - really smooth gliding along the neck for example, so I guess at some level you do get what you pay for. Grab that Squier HSS though, you can\u2019t help but have fun with it! ",
