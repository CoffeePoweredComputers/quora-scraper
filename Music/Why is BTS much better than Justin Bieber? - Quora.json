            "answer_text": "I can go on for hours.  But it\u2019s a bit difficult to compare a K-pop group to a Western solo artist because they are quite different in terms of concepts, style and culture. But these are a few I can highlight: BTS dances better Since they are a K-pop group, they all received proper training while they were trainees. Thus, they were trained in dancing for a long time. Even though Justin Bieber dances as well, BTS has official dance choreographies in almost every song they have and the synchronization they have is unbelievably amazing. Compared to Bieber, BTS outshines him in terms of techniques, formation, choreography and numbers.  2. BTS is more disciplined and has a better image/reputation It\u2019s no secret that Justin Bieber had multiple infamous incidents regarding his behaviour or attitude such as being late for his concert, being banned in China for \u2018bad behaviour\u2019. The wish of his staff or mentors for him to remain humble is now gone as the public now believes fame has gotten into his head. As for BTS, they are now at their peak and so far, have not been caught in any scandals or criticism for behaviour as severe as Bieber. To be honest, if Justin Bieber was an Asian artist based in Asia, his career will be gone dead, an apology won\u2019t be enough. There is no way the public in Korea or across Asia will be able to tolerate him because of his conduct or past mistakes. Celebrities in Asia who are caught in scandals such as drug or sex have a much harder time regaining the trust of the public once more. Incidents such as Tiffany from Girls\u2019 Generation posted an animation of the imperial Japanese flag on her snapchat near the day of Korean independence day and she received so much criticism to the point she was removed from a show. It\u2019s been months but netizens are still salty. Thus, having a good reputation and image is important which is why Big Hit Entertainment (Company of BTS) enforces discipline and rules on the boys such as avoiding talking about love relationship. For example, RM from BTS said that they were not allowed to eat noodles while on a diet. 5 Banned Foods That Idols Are Absolutely Forbidden To Eat 3. BTS is visually more stunning Like most K-pop groups, BTS is all about visuals. Their music videos, costumes, concepts, albums are all beautifully decorated.  BTS wears more makeup than Justin Bieber K-pop idols wear much much more makeup than Western artists or celebrities. Male stars don\u2019t just stop at foundation and contour, they go full-on. Both sides have a \u2018pretty boy\u2019 image but BTS definitely outshines   3. BTS is funnier  1. Justin Bieber has more freedom Because of cultural differences, sometimes it\u2019s difficult to understand the Asian or Korean entertainment industry. To add on to the previous points, BTS, however, has less freedom to say what they want, eat what they want or choose the music they want to make compared to Bieber. In Korea, you are managed by a company and are \u2018groomed\u2019 or \u2018manufactured\u2019, BTS is a manufactured group, they didn\u2019t just come together. However, compared to other K-pop groups, BTS has more freedom in making music now. Bieber on the other hand, has more say to what music he wants to do since the start. He has the freedom to write his own lyrics or songs or whoever he wants to collaborate with. But for BTS, they have to get through the company\u2019s approval first especially when it comes to collaboration or even what they post on their social media accounts.  Please don\u2019t start fanwars in the comment sectionCheers all x ",

            "answer_text": "Let me preface this by saying I actually like Justin Bieber's music. I use a lot of his music in dance competitions. I bought the digital version of Purpose because it had really really really good music. What I don't like about JB is his attitude and his treatment of other human beings. He believes he is entitled to the front of the line, the best seats, no waiting, disregard the people around him when he's making them uncomfortable. Attitude is why BTS is better than JB. None of them would spit on a fan, flip off a fan, drive their auto thru Hannam Hills at breakneck speed and endanger lives. They wouldn't be seen coming out of an infamous brothel in Brasil or threatening a barista because they came in without wearing a shirt or shoes. Both have great music. It's just the attitude. ",
