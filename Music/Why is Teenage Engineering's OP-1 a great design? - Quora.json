            "answer_text": "It's hard to really say that the OP-1 was/is a hot item. It all falls back to supply vs. demand. Sure, their first run sold out in the pre-order stage, but TE is a small company and I think their initial run was only about 1,000 units. That is not a very large first run, so just because they sold them out during pre-orders, that information alone can't really qualify them as \"hot\" items. And while there is a growing and dedicated fan base, these units are not as common as, say, a Micorkorg. I know that's not a very fair comparison, but I think you see what I'm saying. I can't foresee the OP-1 becoming a common term among musicians and I think it will always be a niche product for a certain subset of those aforementioned musicians.  With that said, I own one (two, actually) and there are many reasons to love them:  Design: It's a good looking device. On the outside and in the OS. They do have a talented bunch of designers working there that were able come up with something that is familiar yet unique. The build quality is outstanding. When you hold one, you can just feel quality, much like holding an iPhone. The OS is clean and uncluttered (to some's dismay) and vibrant with color, even though they only really use 5 or 6 different colors. And to fit all of the hardware and software functions into a device that is only about the size of an Apple wireless keyboard is pretty impressive, in my non-engineer opinion.  Functionality: You get a four track recorder with looping functionality, a synthesizer with 8 different \"voices,\" a drum synthesizer, a drum sampler (for chopping up a sample), a synth sampler (for playing a sample and adjusting pitch up and down the keyboard), and a USB Midi Controller. The synth and drum sections each have a few sequencing options including being able to make grid based patterns, note-per-beat patterns (adjustable to be 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32 of the current beat with triplet variations for each), patterns that can be assigned to each key for live pattern changes, and a random sequencer.  Each synth gets an ASDR envelope, an FX slot, and an LFO assignable to FX or synth parameters. There are eight different synth voices that can mimic standard synth tones to voices that are completely unique to the OP-1. Users can save patches of created sounds and recall them later to any one of the eight synth patch slots for easy one-button access to that patch. The synth sampler gets six seconds of sample time with the ability to adjust the sample start and end points, pitch, and sample end loop points.  The drum section gets the ability to set eight different drum kits to the eight drum slots for one-button access. There is an FX slot and LFO that are both assignable like the synth section. Drum sounds are assigned to the keyboard keys. The drum synth allows you to create a sound for each of the keys the same as a regular sampled drum kit would allow. The drum sampler gets 12 seconds of record time and can chop the sample up into 25 different sections. Start and end points can be adjusted, as well as pitch for each section of the sample. User created drum kits can be saved and recalled at a later time. Finally, the tape (recording/playback) section gives you four tracks to record onto with 6 total minutes of recording time. The tape section also allows you to set loop in and out points for looping a section of tape. When you have a loop section set, you can move that section forward or backwards on the tape, which allows you to create entire songs on only a few seconds of tape. You get a master FX unit, basic mixing and panning controls, and a basic master EQ section. You can split, cut and paste tracks sections around and re-combine them.  That's a basic overview of what you get with it. I probably overlooked many things, but I think that covers most of the highlights of the unit.  Limitations: It's weird to say that limitations of a tool are a advantage, but to me in this case, they are. For me, when I sit in front of Ableton, I get overwhelmed with all the options and find myself focusing on using all the tools available rather than on the music I'm trying to make. With the OP-1, I still have a lot of available functionality, but there are limits to what it can do compared to a full function DAW. I find it a lot easier for me to work on a song with the OP-1 and focus on the music I'm making first and then transfer the files to a DAW for some tweaking/mastering, if needed. Limitations force creativity.  Portability: The battery life of the OP-1 lasts longer than my iPad's battery. That is quite amazing. That combined with the size allows you to take this anywhere and create music, save that creation, move to a different location and show it off to your friends, get feedback and ideas and tweak your song right on the spot. Anybody that has every written music with a band knows how beneficial it is to be able to try out different things while receiving immediate feedback.  Also, I sit in front of a computer all day at work and when I come home and want to make music, it is not very appealing to sit back down in front of the computer. For me, hardware has always been more fun to work with than software on a computer. To me, the OP-1 is an instrument, just like my string instruments, whereas a computer does not convey the same feelings for me, even if it's running an incredible soft synth. I don't think that it's a highly argued point that people love hardware's focus, but also love software's flexibility. The OP-1 strikes the best balance between the two that I know of.  Quirkiness: The OP-1 has some great visual interfaces that in no way add to the function of the device other than give you a little bit of a visual representation of the settings. Some users have wished that TE forgot the graphics and used the space to put in standard parameters and maybe add some additional features. For me, the graphics just make the experience of using the unit that much better. I liken it to viewing data in spreadsheet compare to a graph or chart - it's the same data, but way more fun to see it in color and shapes.  Also, the sound isn't the cleanest out there. Don't get me wrong, it's not that noticeable and I don't find it a problem, but I have heard others complain. Like I said, it hasn't bothered me at all, and let's not forget that people have stuck with their MPC's for their unique sound over software samplers for many, many years. In my opinion, it's just the character of the OP-1's and that's fine by me.  Not For Everyone: With all that, the OP-1 is not for everyone. It cost is somewhat of a premium for most folks and I completely understand that. It's way less powerful that most DAWs that you can get for less than what they are asking for the OP-1, so if you are looking for the most economic option, this guy is not it. But, if you much prefer hardware to software, like the option of bringing something with you to make music with wherever you go, and don't mind people asking you \"What is that?\" all the time, then the OP-1 is an amazing piece of gear. It's the best money I've spent on music gear in a long, long time. ",
