            "answer_text": "Hillsong Worship (formerly known as Hillsong LIVE) and Hillsong United (also known as UNITED) are part of Hillsong Church\u2019s music ministry called Hillsong Music. The main difference between Hillsong Worship and UNITED are their missions. The mission of Hillsong Worship is to build the local church and local churches across the world through passionate and genuine worship. Hillsong Worship\u2019s focus is to make sure they\u2019re doing their part in resourcing to local church worship teams. On the other hand, UNITED\u2019s mission is to write songs that \u201cawaken churches and individuals to the fact that we are redeemed and called into the story of God.\u201d Unlike Hillsong Worship, UNITED focuses on reaching individuals inside and outside the church through their unique musical sound. Although Hillsong Worship and UNITED\u2019s missions are different, they still follow the same vision of Hillsong Church which is \u201cto reach and influence the world by building a large Christ-centered, Bible-based church, changing mindsets and empowering people to lead and impact in every sphere of life.\u201d Also, since Hillsong Church is so huge, they need a lot of volunteers to help with their different ministries and church services. Taya is among one of the many worship leaders at Hillsong who helps sing and lead worship at the church. She is most recognized than Hillsong\u2019s other worship leaders because she is one of UNITED\u2019s core songwriters and singers.
