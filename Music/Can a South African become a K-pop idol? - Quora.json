            "answer_text": "Okay, I\u2019m going to be brutally honest with you. You can, but there\u2019s a higher chance of you not becoming one. Okay, let\u2019s say that you can rap, sing, and dance. Also, you\u2019re pretty. Perfect. So you audition and get accepted. Now what? You will become a trainee, and will face one of the toughest times in your life. Your company will control your every aspect of life. From what you wear to what you eat, they will be monitoring your every move. You will be on strict diet, and will have to practice dancing/singing/rapping for half of the day. If you\u2019re a foreigner, you will also have to learn Korean. And it has to be 100% perfect. I don\u2019t think you will get much sleep either. After a year of exhausting training, will you get to debut? Probably not. Some idols train for years before debuting, and some don\u2019t even make it. So they keep training on and on, unsure of when they get to achieve their biggest dream. Anyways, let\u2019s say that you do get to debut. Your trainee days are finally over, and your idol life is just starting. But will people accept you? Lisa from BLACKPINK is born in Thailand, and she gets a lot of hate for not being Korean. Even Taiwanese, Japanese and Chinese idols get criticized for their nationality. So if I be painfully honest\u2026.No. I don\u2019t think many people will accept you, let alone your nationality. I\u2019m sorry if I crushed your dreams, but this is the hard reality. The world of K-Pop is a dark place despite how perfect it seems. Many kpop idols face depression and anxiety from online harassment, bullies and being controlled by the company from signing the slave contract. Some even ends their lives. But if you still want to achieve your dream, I won\u2019t stop you. Good luck, and love yourself the way you are \ud83d\udc9c ",

            "answer_text": "Even if you are extremely gifted with good looks, multilingualism, the abilities to rap, sing, dance and act, it might not work since the Kpop industry only wants people who are East Asian. There is a Kpop girl group that I know of called Coco Avenue and are all African-American, but they are signed under an American agency so it isn't technically, literally, basically, practically, properly genuine Kpop. In the future, though, agencies might be more open and diversal and accept a widerrange of cultures, but I'm no fortune teller so I don't know what will happen. If you really want to get involved with K-Culture, try and become a model or actor because there are a few non-asians I know who are still in the Korean industry. I'm unsure and I doubt that you will get a chance to become an idol, but do not adopt the same mindset as me. If this is your number one choice for a career, look for something else you are passionate about and focus on that. When and if a time comes where you are able to audition for a company, you can switch to Kpop. Don't keep your hopes high but always be on the look out for an opportunity. ",
