            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t. It is impossible. Because the payment system is not based in a payment by stream, as several persons think. What User-13268839344100365875 says, quoting Spotify, is on average and as an orientation. Spotify\u2019s payment system works this way: income - 70% in royalties = 30% earnings. It means: they pay 70% of their income as royalties. If the income is 1 million, they pay 700k in royalties. If it is 100 millions, they pay 70 millions. Income comes mainly from 2 sources: abo (10/month) and advertisement (from the free accounts). In short: if you and 20 millions of your closest friends listen 50 songs a day, the result will not be that Spotify looses money, but that the artists will receive less money pro stream. In other words, Spotify\u2019s income doesn\u2019t depend too much on the actual usage of the system (!) This is very smart done. Juan Maria Solare ",
