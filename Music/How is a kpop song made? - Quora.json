            "answer_text": "How is a kpop song made? I\u2019m glad you asked! I\u2019m an expert when it comes to writing KPOP songs. First, you gotta know the rules. There are lots of them, but we\u2019ll delve into the ones I care about the most. RULE NUMBER ONE: You gotta be able to title the song. The most common way is to just use one word in English. If you get lost, just follow EXO, as they are the best at this. Here are some examples\u2026 \"Growl,\" \"Wolf,\" \"Monster,\" \"Tempo,\" \"Power,\" \"Lotto,\" \"Lightsaber(??!),\" \"Lucky,\" \"Unfair,\" \"Angel,\" \"Moonlight,\" \"Mama,\" \"Senorita,\" \"Fancy,\" \"Automatic,\" \"BAAM,\" \"View,\" \"Sherlock,\" \"Juliet,\" \"Lucifer,\" \"Evil,\" \"Countess,\" \"Fire,\" \"Hello,\" \"Haan,\"\"Latata,\" \"Gashina,\" \"Heroine,\" \"Siren,\" \"Likey,\" \"Signal,\" \"Touchdown,\" \"Happiness,\" \"Rookie,\" \"Natural,\" \"Butterflies,\" \"Dimelo,\" \"Sunrise,\" \"Rough,\" \"Memoria,\" \u201cCloser,\u201d \u201cCupid,\u201d \u201cMagnetic,\u201d \u201cLullaby,\u201d \u201cLook,\u201d \u201cA,\u201d \u201cTeenager,\u201d \u201cIf,\u201d \u201cFly,\u201d \u201cSick,\u201d \u201cSign,\u201d \u201cIdol,\u201d \u201cDope,\u201d \u201cRun.\u201d \u201cGenie,\u201d \u201cGee,\u201d You get the picture. This is really important! If you can\u2019t stick with one word, just use it twice! \u201cJelly Jelly,\u201d \u201cBoom Boom,\u201d \u201cMr. Mr.,\u201d \u201cDalla Dalla.\u201d This shows you\u2019ve been working hard and took the song title into REAL consideration. Fuck it, do it THREE TIMES! \u201cMy My My,\u201d \u201cNo No No,\u201d \u201cBang Bang Bang.\u201d RULE NUMBER TWO: Give it an English title that you never plan on saying in the song, like not ever. \u201cHobgoblin,\u201d \u201cSpring Day,\u201d \u201cFXXK It.\u201d It many cases, you can just say it in Korean. Or NOT! \u201cPlaying With Fire,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m So Sick.\u201d RULE NUMBER THREE: You must include English words in your lyrics. They don\u2019t even have to make sense! Just throw it in there! At first, I was like \u201cWhy not take two minutes when writing your song to make sure your English lyrics are logical.\u201d Then, I realized I was being ridiculous. Examples: \u201cEveryday I shock! Every night I shock!\" \u201cConnect the dots, disconnect the line, Let's shine like Scorpio in the sky.\u201d \u201coh my my my, You got me fly so fast\u2026\u201d \u201cSky high, sky fly, sky dope. (We still) Same try, same scar, same work\u2026\u201d \u201cLet me see how you gon' treat me\u2026I ain't no easy\u2026\u201d \u201cJust close your lips. Shut your tongue.\" \u201cI was meeting with friends, SHY SHY SHY!\u201d \u201cWhy don't you know don't you know don't you know yeah\u2026\u201d \u201cWe gonna go rocka rocka rocka rocka rocka rocka. So fantastic - Go rocka rocka rocka rocka rocka rocka. So elastic - Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic, fantastic - Elastic, elastic, elastic, elastic, I call you butterfly.\" (wtf\u2026) Great! Or, as Momoland would say, for no reason whatsoever \u201cGREAT!\u201d FINAL RULE: Overuse several terms like \uac00\ud0c0, \uc0ac\ub791\ud574, \ubcf4\uace0 \uc2f6\uc5b4 or \ucc98\ub7fc or even say \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\ucc98\ub7fc in your song (Forever Young) even if you named your other song that already (As If It\u2019s Your Last.) So, if I were to follow these rules, I\u2019ll give it a freestyle shot. My song is called \u201cCat Cat Cat.\u201d Hey baby, I\u2019m like a cloud in the wind Sweet strawberry love with a moonlight kiss. Up in the sky too many birds. I can't see the sun. A beast on the prowl. Meow Meow I like you like you like you I like you like you like you I like you like you like you I like you like you like you I like you like you like you I like you like you like you I like you like you like you I like you like you like you I like you like you like you I like you like you like you Cuz I\u2019m \uace0\uc591\uc774 \uace0\uc591\uc774 \uace0\uc591\uc774 RAWR! \uace0\uc591\uc774 \uace0\uc591\uc774 \uace0\uc591\uc774 RAWR! Put the milk out! Put the milk out! Meow Meow Yeah, something like that. Inkigayo, here I come! The best way is to just wing it like you don\u2019t gaf. Acting like you don\u2019t care is cool! It\u2019s like \"Peaches and cream, sweeter than sweet chocolate cheeks and chocolate wings.\" (dont get mad. this is done in jest\u2026mostly :) GREAT! ",

            "answer_text": "ON how the song is made , KPop is just like any other genre . it's the same like any songs from canto pop or main-stream us pop or rock or even rap song . IF you meant about wrote those songs , then there are many parts . Song singer wrote the song them-self like Zico for example . He wrote and composed most of the song himself . Bigbang's G Dragon is also an accomplished songwriter . For those that did not wrote his or her own songs , their representative company will choose the most suitable for for the said KPOP artist . They are many song writer and dance designer in the industry . These company will choose the best song suitable for the said artist based on \u201c if the song suits the artist concept\u201d . ",
