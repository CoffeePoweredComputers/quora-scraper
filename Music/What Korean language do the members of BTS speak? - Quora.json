            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not quite sure about what you mean. Yes, North Korean and South Korea have been divided for quite some time now so their languages have also taken different directions in terms of certain words they use for the same thing. BTS, however are born and raised in South Korea and therefore speak \u2018\u2019South Korean\u2019\u2019. They have also been raised in different parts of South Korean, resulting in them knowing and sometimes using different dialects - satoori. Jimin and Jungkook were born and raised in Busan - speaking Busan dialect. Suga and V were born and raised in Daegu - speaking Daegu dialect. J-Hope was born and raised in Gwangju - speaking Jeolla dialect. Rap Mon and Jin were raised in the Seoul are and therefore never picked up any particular dialect. Therefore speaking Seoul accent. All the boys now speak with a Seoul accent because they live and work in Seoul, but it\u2019s also the mainstream accent for celebrities to use. ",

            "answer_text": "They all speak standard Korean, which happens to be the Seoul dialect, on TV. In some videos and in private, V and Jimin tend to speak their native dialects, Daegu and Busan dialect respectively. Jungkook is also from Busan, and sometimes local expressions slip out of his mouth. Suga is from Daegu, and J-Hope from Jeolla, but they're heard less often to speak in dialect. Interesting fact, watching Bon Voyage season 2, I noticed that they use different adverbs than other idols I follow, but that's only a choice of vocabulary, not a matter of dialect. ",
