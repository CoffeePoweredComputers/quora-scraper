            "answer_text": "To improve your rapping you must pick any song you like (I would recommend a slow one, since you are just starting), pick a lyric video and put it on the slowest playback speed possible (0.5x, rather than 0.25x). Start rapping over it, to get the hang of it, and when you do, increase the speed. Do this repeatedly until you get to normal speed, and then take an instrumental (or karaoke version) and rap.  When you have mastered the instrumental, take it away and do it without background music, since you will have to send and audio or video of just your rapping. Record yourself so you can see your mistakes. It is really important that you see your own mistakes, so your audition will be as best as possible. If you can, show it to your family or friends with a comparison to the original song, they will tell you where you can improve (it\u2019s better if at least someone knows about music) Then, once you\u2019ve sent it, the company will only think you\u2019re unique, if you are truly unique. You must have talent, and a lot of charisma, they must see passion in your videos and your audios, they have to see that you truly want this. Fighting! ",
