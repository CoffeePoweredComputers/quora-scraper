            "answer_text": "1. Ros\u00e9  I think Ros\u00e9 will have the most disadvantage. Although she might still be famous, she doesn\u2019t fit the Korean beauty standards, and she\u2019ll have to stop using her high pitched voice if she wants to continue her music career. Her natural voice suits her much, much better and she sounds really good with that. Although she might be able to model, she is much more of a singer. 2. Jisoo  Jisoo will be next to first with the most disadvantage. This will be because even though she has many talents, she most likely will not have as many advantages as Lisa or Jennie. Jisoo has that actor face and she fits Korean beauty standards almost perfectly, she also has had done a couple of acting gigs before, and that\u2019s why I think she could make a good actor. She could also do advertising and modeling. 3. Lisa  I put Lisa second because she is a great dancer, and as seen on Youth with You, she is a great mentor. She could become a dance teacher, I think she also do good in modeling, and seeing her Instagram followers, I believe that she will have a large following to support her. 4. Jennie  Jennie is 4th because I believe she has the most advantages. She is very pretty and gives off that luxurious vibe. She is ambassador of Chanel Korea and it is speculated that her family is very rich. Jennie could also model and has a gorgeous modeling face. Like Lisa, she has quite a large following on Instagram, which means yet another advantage. Although I think Ros\u00e9 may have the most disadvantages, that doesn\u2019t mean that she won\u2019t succeed farther. Jennie obviously has a lot of advantages right now, and if Blackpink fades away, she will sure grow, possibly starting a fashion line. Jisoo and Lisa have a high chance of succeeding because Jisoo has looks + skills and Lisa has looks + skills, they could be more famous in the future. Hope this helped! :) ",

            "answer_text": "I'm just going to give a different perspective to what the other answers have. Most Disadvantage (who would have the hardest time) Rose - though she has a nice singing voice her style is very unique to YG & can work against her. She would have to try a whole new way of singing that she wouldn't be recognized for. That & the fact that aside from modeling she does with her group, she gets no promotion from YG means she'd have to completely start over & would have the hardest time.Lisa - she's a great dancer & has proven to be a competent judge on shows. She would probably have to return to Thailand though. She would be fine but lose a lot of momentum being a Kpop idol has given her.Jenny - what ranks her high is that YG has been selling her to the Korean audience for years. She's already well known so transitioning out of Kpop would be easy for her. Downside her voice isn't the strongest so going completely solo without the companies support would be difficult. She would have to fall back on modeling.Jisoo - she already has an acting career started so she could easily go into that full time. The fact that she has more opportunities with that & modeling gives her a head start compared to her members.If the girls had to completely give up the music industry Jisoo is the one who already has a career set up whereas the other girls would take some adjusting.
