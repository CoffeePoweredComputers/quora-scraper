            "answer_text": "Most festivals or celebrations have music of some sort. Human society is very important for survival of human kind.So dance and music might have been evolutionary tools to synchronize the group and build social bonds.Different people may use different patterns/steps as it's possible to get different step-patterns for same number of beats. 10 beats = (1*10) or (2*5) or (3+3+3+1) and so on.For example there's an animated gif of a girl dancing. You play any song the character seems to be dancing in step to the music or beat. Apparently this works because the dance is very graceful and the viewers brain finds the fitting step-pattern for given beat of music.Language is another construct used to communicate and coordinate between members of a human group.Music esp vocal music uses a wide range of tones to express emotion. If you take the tones and semi-tones have various shades of emotion like stern, angry, loving, sweet, sad, fearful etc. That's one of the reasons background instrumental music is used in movies to determine the mood of the scene.Many a times a particular smell or aroma suddenly transports one back to a powerful childhood memory. Similarly music and dance can have unconscious and subconscious associated memories. Mostly visual memories predominate but the other senses too have a powerful yet subconscious role to play.Human beings can hear in the range of 20\u201320000Hz. This is audible range. Different instruments and voices have different ranges of sounds.Drum beats remind instinctively of mothers heart beat in the womb. Babies also build the strength in their limbs by kicking their feet and using the umbilical cord to strengthen their grip (useful in grasping and holding onto the mother after birth as seen in monkeys)Normally drum beats are used give the rhythm in music and that's people tap their feet or dance to. This maybe a result of instinctive feeling of moving limbs to a heart beat in the womb.The evolutionary setup to move limbs to a beat may have got reused as a social bonding mechanism.All music has a tempo or \u2018laya\u2019 (timing) that is what is danced to. Drums only makes the beat explicit.Also every human being has a heart beat. Our hearts beat louder/faster at higher levels of activity just like in the music. Many times we like to dance slow or fast, depending on our mood. Sometimes we like to change our mood by listening and dancing to faster more energetic beat.",
