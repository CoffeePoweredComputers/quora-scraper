            "answer_text": "How can one even start? I will start leaving out ALL black/death/grindcore metal bands because, imho, their names are meant to be ridiculous (like \"Anal Cunt\"). I don't also include band names that are atrocious, but sound funny enough (like \"Oingo Boingo\", which reminds me of boobs, and nothing that reminds one of boobs can be really bad). Not considering them, here is a selection of band names which I consider silly, and an appendix that mentions names of Brazilian pop bands.  The The - This one should come first in evey list. It's so damn stupid that it can't even sound funny.Smashing Pumpkins - The founder of the band, Billy Corgan, has admited more than once that he regrets the name. Toad the West Sprocket - Most bombastic band names are ludicrous, but this one is blah...Mott the Hoople - Band members, fans, producers... everyone agreed that the horrible name hurt the image of the band and cut their career short. They were talented, had a good frontman and made some mean music, but their name sucked so hard that left purple stains on the fan's skins.Yes - Their music is good, but their name sucks bigtime. Supposedly Jon Anderson wanted a name that sounded \"positive\".All band names that merely list the names of the components: Peter, Paul and Mary; Emerson, Lake and Palmer; Crosby, Stills and Nash (or Nash and Young), etc. How can you be LESS creative?Anyone's Daughter - Naming your band after a song by another artist is cool, if the both the title and the song are good. Deep Purple had done it (google for the original blues that was used for the band's name), so a german pop group decided to name themselves after a Deep Purple song (that's recursion!), but they choose this weird (and hideous) song about a man who \"does\" (that's the word) the daughter of an enraged farmer instead of anyone else's. I wanted to puke when I heard the song for the first time. But the german group is not bad.Camel - Naming your band after a famous brand is already cumbersome, to name it after a cigarette brand is the ultimate political incorrectness, to supposedly receive payment (and free cigarette packs) for it is bordering on immoral, but to choose such a bland brand name is a sin. In spite of it, their music is awesome and I will be a fan of Mr. Andrew Latimer for ever.The Alan Parsons Project - Their music is good and I admit I am a fan of their AOR. But the name sounds like something your high school teacher told you to assemble over the weekend: \"Now, class, sit down and watch as Alan Parsons presents his project.\"Triumvirat - What's silly about this band's name is that they were only briefly a trio.Faster Pussycat - They probably wanted to use \"Josie and the Pussycats\" but could not afford to pay royalties to Hanna-Barbera. They should have.The Band - I would not be surprised to learn that there is some relationship between them and the founders of \"The The\".Dave Matthews Band  and all bands named after the leader (except \"The Alan Parsons Project\", which is even sillier)  - If you are such an egocentric that you need to name your band after you, why don't you just do like pop singers who go by their name? Why add \"band\" after your name?Doobie Brothers - I bet that back in the day \"doobie\" meant something cool, but nowadays I have the giggles when I hear their name, because I remember Scooby-Doobie-Doo...Godspeed You! Black Emperor - Never heard their music. Its strange name suggests me they are a bunch of nerds from an obscure cult who make a strange and hateful brand of ethnic music mixed with drugs.Kin Ping Meh - A German band with a Chinese name ripped off an old literary work. But, hey! At least they didn't call it Erstenzuende Neubaten.Panic! At the Disco - You can't help remembering them if you mention the former.Butthole Surfers - Give your band a name that your fans will be ashamed to mention in front of their parents, preachers, girlfriends and even local sex-shop workers. Give your band a name that makes you sound like you are absolute perverts with an anal fixation. Then make nice pop music. Matching Mole - In-jokes are horrible. They just make everybody else feel dumb. That's especially true of bilingual, recursive in-jokes. You come from a band called \"Soft Machine\" that has split. You create a new outfit by translating its name into French (\"Machine Molle\") using a dictionary and then writing the name using English words that look similar. Your first album also has a couple of moles (the animals) looking into each other. And I only know this because the band members one day broke it to the press. They only have a soft spot in my heart because their second album was called \"Little Red Record\".Live - They were a nice band, made a mean sound. But I couldn't follow their career after \"Mental Jewelry\" because when I googled for them I got hundreds of results for live albums by other bands and singers. Worst publicity ever. All the fault of the loser who named them.Mr. Mister - So \"The The\" has had a lasting influence on music...Of Montreal - Lacking creativity, out of humour, out of wit...Pop Will Eat Itself - This prophesy should have come true...Echo and the Bunnymen - The name had nothing to do with their music, but was silly as hell.A-ha - They say it means something cool in Norwegian. Probably the level of coolness of the Norwegian language is abysmal. Or, perhaps, they're lying and the name only means something like \"Argh\". Well, but that would be a cool band name...Italian prog bands who named themselves after commercial companies (fake or real) like \"Banco del Mutuo Soccorso\" (Mutual Help Bank), \"Consorzio Aqua Potabile\" (Drinking Water Consortium) and \"Premiata Forneria Marconi\" (Marconi's Prized Bakery). They were (sadly) immitated elsewhere (bad ideas do spread), like the Spanish outfit named \"Companya Electrica Dharma\" (Dharma Electric Co.).Some quite unknown Brazilian pop bands had very bad, bad names. But since they are not mainstream, I included them in this appendix.  Paralamas do Sucesso (\"Smashing Mudskippers\" or \"Successful Mudskippers\" if you want to sound less British). The band admits that the name is a liability and often signs their albums as \"Paralamas\" only. There was some joke involved in the name. It was forgotten. The band was never meant to last so long, and to become the breadwinning outfit for its members.Engenheiros do Hawaii (\"Engineers from Hawaii\"). Another internal joke that nobody understood and another named that became a liability (and another band who has sometimes signed an abbreviated version of its own name). Frontman Humberto Gessinger says that the name was meant to poke fun at the guys from the Enginnering course at the University, who partied hard all time but were still seen by the society as \"more serious\" than the guys from the Architecture course (where Gessinger studied). Nobody got the joke. Gessinger has had to explain it many times. Each time less people care.Ultraje a Rigor. So silly that it is difficult to explain what it is meant. \"Ultraje\" means \"Outrage\", but \"Traje\" means \"suit\". \"Traje a Rigor\" means \"Formal suit\" (that one used in weddings and classical music concertoes). Banda Black Rio. Mangled English is a bad choice for a band name. Always. But if you make a steaming, melodious, groovy kind of music that has even the trees dance, then you will become legendary anyway.Skank. You were young, wild and free. You named your band after a dirty street drug (marijuana mixed with what would be later called \"crak cocaine\"). Suddenly you become a hit. People get the joke and it is funny because it is politically incorrect. Ten years later you are a respectable bunch of guys making soothing beatlesque songs and wearing nice square clothes. Capital Inicial. Sounds silly because the phrase means \"initial capital\", the money used to form a corporation. But they began as a punk-rock band. OH, gosh, they later \"betrayed the movement\", but that didn't make their name sound less silly.Avec Tristesse. Somebody told me about this band. It is a real band. They even have a Wikipedia article, though I never heard about them. The name means \"With Sadness\"... in French.Nechivile. If you want to name your band after a city in a foreign country (which is already foolish), why don't you even learn how to spell it?Tihuana. Same as above. That's worse when you actually make good music. But perhaps \"seeing gnomes\" was more important (their major hit was a song called \"Eu Vi Gnomos\" - I Have Seen Gnomes).Quinteto Violado. The name was intended to be cool: Five guys playing different types of folk string instruments (violas and \"violoes\") would make a \"Quinteto Violado\". However, \"violado\" also means \"raped\" in Portuguese, so the name could be understood as \"The Five Raped Ones\"... Inimigos da HP. No, they are not bent on  destroying Hewlett-Packard Co. They are a group of former engineers who decided to make foolish pop music instead of building structures that would collapse as their career did.EDIT: I have decided to add a second appendix, with names of progressive rock bands. Prog rock has a lot of silly band names, but, unlike black metal and relatives, whose band names are meant to be silly, prog band names are meant to mean something...  Absolute Elsewhere. Not bad a name for a band that made music based on Erich von Daniken's books.Albergo Intergalattico Spaziale. Italians suck at naming bands, apparently. This one means \"Intergalactic Hostel in Space\". Bombastic, but silly.Aphrodite's Child. Greeks suck too. They didn't even bother to specify which of the children of Aphrodite they rendered homage to. Was it Eros? Bread, Love and Dreams. Well, at least they promise you something better than \"Blood, Sweat and Tears\" (another actual band name).Can. How can you have a more minimal band name? These Germans took the cue of \"Yes\" and decided that in the future people Googling about them would be screwed.Julian's Treatment. If your psychiatrist recomends musical therapy to you, it's not a good idea to mention it in the name of the band you form with other patients.Inkubus Sukkubus. For two reasons: one is that it makes no sense (an incubus is an active sex demon and a succubus is a passive one, and you can't be simultaneously on top and below) and the other is that it sounds horrible. Not content with that they changed the spelling to make it look horrible too (the band was originally called \"Incubus Succubus\", but there was already a German outfit with that name).Manfred Mann's Earth Band. Besides the fact that they repeated offenders (1 - named after the leader, 2 - using the word \"band\" in the band name, 3 - long pompous name) they reportedly included in one of their records a small plastic bag containing actual earth, excavated from a place in Wales...Mr. So & So.  Makes you wonder whether they formed this band after the split of Mr. More or Less.Popul Ace. These Norwegian guys were named Popol Vuh (actually a bad band name on its own) when they were amateurish. Suddenly they became professional and discovered that there was already a German band going by that name (fat chance!) and that they were already quite famous (they made soundtracks for Werner Herzog's films). Forced to change their name, the Northmen chose this pitiful substitute... The saddest of all things is that they were the ones who actually knew what the Popol Vuh was (a book written in the XVI century by the Mayan people).The Legendary 64 Spoons. Gosh, spoons that play jazz-rock! And they are British too. I must buy their records. But no...Raccomandata con Ricevuta di Ritorno. \"Package with Return Receipt.\" Must I explain why I hate this name? And why I think Italians suck at naming bands?Recordando o Vale das Ma\u00e7\u00e3s. \"Remembering the Valley of the Apples\". Apparently the Italian cheesiness on band naming made disciples in Brazil. This band was very typical Brazilian prog of the seventies, with falsetto vocals and folkish melodies. And apples didn't grow in Brazil back then.Il Rovescio della Medaglia. \"The Flipside of the Medal\". I really hate Italian band names...Samla Mammas Manna. These Swedish guys chose such a bad name that even they could not write it correctly. There are albums by this band named \"Zamla Mammas Manna\", \"Von Zamla\", \"Zamlaranamma\" etc. And none of the variations sound good.Star-Spangled Banner. Could be a nice name if these guys were American instead of Austrian.",

A super talented band who chose poorly and built a following with a really awful band name. This is why I tell artists not to choose a controversial band name; it will backfire!  ",

When the name of a band gives you a sinking feeling and incipient depression before you\u2019ve even seen them or heard them play, you know that name is a mistake. Tich, my friend who ran the the promotion I mentioned, had performed with and managed a few bands himself, and had worked for EMI for a time, raised the matter with their manager who saw absolutely no problem. We shrugged. As a band \u201cThe Forlorn Hope\u201d were nothing exceptional, but then neither were they bad, and with a good name and management had an outside chance of doing more than local showcases or minor venue gigs, but with that name they had no chance. What happened to them, I wonder? ",
