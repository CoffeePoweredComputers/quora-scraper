            "answer_text": "While making a great song is important for musicians, making a video that goes along with a song will help in different ways. First and most obvious, it will add an extra layer to the music/song. If you have a great video, it will really enhance the overall music experience. Second, from a marketing perspective, you can reach a larger audience. Visuals tend to attract more than sound alone, so adding that awesome music video to your music will attract a broader audience, if use on the right platforms. In the end, I think that the first statement should be the most important. Only add a video to your music if it really means anything. Have fun and keep creating awesome music!

            "answer_text": "Music videos are a great way to show a visual interpretation of the song. It's also a good way for artists to further market a single, that could potentially garner more fans to either purchase or listen to the album or single. Some songs have a deeper meaning to the artists themselves who would want to demonstrate this in a way that's easy for fans to interpret. A good example of this is the video for \u201cCardinals\u201d by the Wonder Years. If you haven\u2019t seen it, I suggest you check it out for great use of symbolism to really evoke emotions regarding the subject matter of the song itself. I hope this helped! ",
