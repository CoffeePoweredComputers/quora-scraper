            "answer_text": "I think they did, for sure, and I think they were both incredible! John Lennon is my favorite singer. I think his voice was just perfect for rock music\u2014it was rough but tender, with a fine bright tone and a unique \"angular\" quality that proved rather influential on rock singers in the seventies. John's natural singing voice was considerably lower than he often sang; while his vocal range was not as impressive as Paul's strictly in terms of size, it was impressive in a different way (that is to say, John had an ability to cut across different registers that do not usually cross with ease). Beyond that, he had an incredible knack for expressive and vulnerable singing and was excellent at phrasing. Also, because he hated the sound of his own voice, he developed, over time, an incredible ability with various vocal effects and studio techniques which have since been widely replicated. As others have noted, Paul McCartney's voice was sweeter and \"prettier,\" and his singing sounds considerably more effortless. He also had a wider vocal range, and a few times John had Paul sing certain lines or parts of Lennon-penned songs that were just out of reach. Paul's singing was fairly expressive as well, and he had a strength for comedic and theatrical approaches to singing. The two had particular strengths, I think. John was better at phrasing and, in my opinion, had a wider expressive palette. Paul had a superior vocal range and generally a stronger, sturdier voice. In \"classical\" terms Paul was the better singer, but also not particularly remarkable compared to, say, Pavarotti or some such. By the criteria of rock music\u2014which, in a word, has to do with character and various idiosyncratic \"modes\" or \"styles\" of expression\u2014Paul and John were fairly evenly accomplished, and, in my view, among the very, very best.

            "answer_text": "Paul McCartney had and still has a great voice technically and expressively where Lennon had an expressive voice and used it well , but not superior technically like McCartney. McCartney had a much wider vocal range , effortless , no strain unless he faked that he was straining , and McCartney had the ability to change his voice quite a bit on different Songs. Most would say they were both \u2018 great \u2018 singers in terms of expression and creativity but voice teachers and those types would tell you McCartney had superior technique and/ or more gifted vocal chords. In Classic Opera terms - ( still a good way to classify Pop Singers in terms of vocal range and character of their voice) , McCartney would be called a Lyric Tenor , and Lennon a High Baritone . George Harrison was halfway in between the two in many ways , his vocal delivery was more effortless than John Lennon and he had a wider range than Lennon but not as wide as McCartney. George Harrison was also a great singer, there was a LOT of vocal talent in that Group. The Beatles were quite rare because they had 3 lead singers in one Group - any of them could have been a lead singer in a Band and a very ,very good one. They also harmonized extremely well together even live ( when they could hear each other ). ",
