            "answer_text": "Your question has less to do with where the production occurs and how much it costs and more to do with where and how the film will be distributed. There are many sources of music licenses for films. From independent artists to music licensing companies with music libraries to giant labels. I've mostly had experience with music libraries in the United States and they base their prices on criteria like run time (how long we hear the song), where and how it is distributed (global, domestic, broadcast, online, etc), and what kind of production it is (advertisement, theatrical film, etc). From a music library you could spend anywhere from 7,000.00 USD to 100,000.00 USD. ",
