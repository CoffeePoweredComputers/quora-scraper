            "answer_text": "Ok here's the deal . Take this seriously and Read it slow and meditate because this is the real deal this is how you really do it . I'm going to assume that you're talking about the devil of The Bible who is the opposer of the writer of The Bible . If that's not who you're talking about just stop reading . \u201cWe know we originate with God but the whole world world lies in the power of the wicked one\u201d . 1st John 5:19 So satan the devil controls the world 3 ways politics commercialism and false religion . So on the Earth right now there are thousands and thousands of religions and they all teach different things . If you use logical reasoning you know that they are ALL satans except one . So if you are in any of those religions , the thousands of them or if you doing absolutely nothing spiritually you're already satans kid . So hes already got you , he doesn't really care and doesn't pay too much attention to what you say . So if you want satan to pay attention to you and listen to you go find a Jehovah's Witness. Start a study if you look at the information honestly there will be no doubt that what you're learning is true . Satan will NOW start paying attention to you as you are looking at standing against him . If you want any of this through scriptural proof just ask I did not cite the scriptures here because I wanted to bait in the curiosity. Real story . When I started to study , my wife at the time , psychologically and emotionally put me through a tremendous amount of abuse . She hates Jehovah's Witnesses. She threw me out and got an exparte . We JWs don't have sex outside marriage so I was in a bad spot . I had women coming at me like water . And some were beautiful. I even had a couple attractive wealthy women coming at me . Women that I normally would have never been able to get , especially with no effort . But understand , satan only comes at you till you fall. In other words, once I would have gone for one , the parade , would have stopped. Again , he doesn't have to give much to folks he already has. So again , if you want satan to pay attention to you seek out a Jehovah's Witness and start a study . Try to take a stand against the devil and he'll pay attention to you . ",
