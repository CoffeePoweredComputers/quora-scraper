            "answer_text": "You could characterize all symphony orchestras as cover bands.  The vast majority of symphonies and other classical pieces played on a given night throughout the world are over a hundred years old.  New stuff is played all the time as well, but even then the musicians playing these new works didn't write them.  This includes operas which of course incorporate singing into the mix. On any night of the week there are bands playing in bars, clubs and other venues in cities across the planet.  Most of these groups are playing covers.  And there's nothing wrong with that at all.  Heck, I've played with cover bands many times and let me tell you, it's really fun!  A good cover band can get a room full of people dancing, singing along and just partying righteously for hours.  Musicians in such bands generally aren't doing it for the money, they're doing it because they love playing music. The question here seems to be asking for some specificity so I'll put forward one of my favorite cover bands.   The Musical Box is a project associated with Cirque du Soleil and recreates the music of the band Genesis.  As cover bands go they show a bit more commitment than most.  They not only play the music of a band from the late '60's and early '70's, they use only equipment from that era.  The aim is to kind of take an audience back in time to an actual Genesis concert.  The musicians approach it all not just as guys playing instruments, but as actors as well.  They are dressed as the members of the band were dressed.  They present themselves onstage as their musician counterparts did.  The stage design recreates the original in tight detail.  It's all pretty neat! Page on youtu.be ",

            "answer_text": "There are many groups like that, oftentimes specializing on a popular idea - eg how my favourite rock band would sound if it was played in style of classical music - solution: Vitamin String Quartet. But I woul really like to recommend one particular group of musicians from New York - Easy-Star All Stars. They are really great in what they do. Focusing on some of the most iconic albums and collaborating with guest singers to produce a distinct reggea version of it. They did this with Sgt Peppers (The Beatles), Dark Side of the Moon (Pink Floyd) and Thriller (Michael Jackson). But in my opinion the most impressive is their rendition of OK Computer (Radiohead).
