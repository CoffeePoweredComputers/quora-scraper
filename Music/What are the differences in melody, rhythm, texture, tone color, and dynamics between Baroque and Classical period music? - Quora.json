            "answer_text": "Generally speaking, Baroque music contained a continuo (chord symbols and bass line, essentially, with a violone playing the bassline, with a lute harpsichord filling in the chords), and was not conducted by a conductor, but rather the orchestra was often led by the harpsichordist. There were no valves on trumpets or horns, and trombones at this time we're not used in the orchestra. The clarinet had yet to be introduced to the orchestra, and the transverse flute was still fairly new, with the fipple flute still being used. Dynamics were very sparse, and often were at the discretion of the performers. The few Dynamics contained in baroque Music are usually just piano and Forte. The standard instrumentation of the era included the recorder, or the fipple flute, the shawm, or oboe, bassoons sometimes, clarino (high valveless trumpet that required exceptional skill to play), as well as an assortment of strings, both the violin family and the viol family. Although towards the end of the Baroque Era, the violin, viola, and cello were very common. In terms of Melody and Harmony, Baroque music was often polyphonic. Cannons, inventions and other such pieces were commonplace. Music was written in Suites, which were basically collections of dance numbers\u2026 gavotte, waltz, minuet, air, gigue, etc. Baroque music is detached, fairly stiff, without vibrato, and with a lot of ornamentation, such as trills, mordents, turns, and so on. Fast forward to the classical era, and we see the addition of the conductor to the orchestra. The timpani is introduced to the orchestra, and the horn becomes a full time member, and later, the clarinet joins. The transverse flute becomes the standard orchestral flute, and the bassoon become a full-time member of the orchestra as well. The string bass becomes a part of the orchestra, and this establishes standard 5 part string section, violin 1, violin 2, viola cello, bass, go through most of the classical era, the cello and bass still played the same part, but in octaves. The addition of Dynamics, Tempo changes, rubato, and other such elements come into play. Ornamentation is less common, but still used often. The symphony becomes the standard large-scale orchestral work, usually containing three or four movements. Music is monophonic: a single Melody with a Harmony and often counter Melody. Orchestration becomes a major factor in composition, and the string section begins to become less dominant, as the woodwind and Brass sections expand. The sound of the symphony orchestra towards the end of The Classical period becomes much more fluid and sonorous, leading into the romantic era. Towards the end of the classical era, some percussion begins to find its way into the orchestra. Towards the end of the classical era, the first chromatic brass instruments introduced, the keyed trumpet is used for the first time. It is until the early Romantic Era that we really start to see valve horns and trumpets used regularly. Anyway, those are just a few of the differences. ",

            "answer_text": "The usual answer to this question is that the harmonic rhythm is much slower in the Classical period than in the Baroque period. Harmonic rhythm is the rate that the chords change. In the Baroque period it was one chord per beat as in a chorale while in the Classical period it was closer to one chord per 4/4 measure. The interest was transferred from the chords to melodic development, a feature of the Classical period. ",
