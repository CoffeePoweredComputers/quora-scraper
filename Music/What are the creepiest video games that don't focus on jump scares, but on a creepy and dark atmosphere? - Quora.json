            "answer_text": "When I saw this question the first picture that came to my mind was that of the Baker family having a dinner together with the player\u2026the only problem with their dinner is that they were having what seemed as human remains to me. ( It could be rotten animal remains also I am not sure) If you haven't still got the game\u2026. It's Resident evil 7 The iconic game from capcom. I would NOT give spoilers. I would highly recommend you to play the game. just go for it The game doesn't have a single jump scare ok may be it has one or two. But I am telling you ,the environment the level of creepyness in the game is just awesome, it's theme is really dark one. It is always gonna keep you on high alert . At least it doesn't has cheap jump scares. It's a master piece . If you like action or horror or survival ok I would just say, if you are a gamer just go for the game . I promise you wouldn't regret the decision. Hope you enjoyed the answer. Pardon me for the mistakes I am new to Quora. Have a nice day.       The dinner table. ",

As you start picking up pages, the atmosphere get creepier and creepier. When the game was first released, it was enough to scare me. However, over time, it lost most of its creepiness. Despite that, it still focuses on the more creepy and dark atmosphere than the jump scare, mostly because you KNOW you\u2019re being hunted by something you can\u2019t kill.
