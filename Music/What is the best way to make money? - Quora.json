            "answer_text": "There's a difference between \u201cearning money\u201d, and \u201chaving a job\u201d. Finding a job becomes easier the more you network. Post ads on Facebook, local Craigslist, and put up homemade flyers (laundromats, grocery stores, libraries, etc.), offering to do housework, tutoring elementary school kids, dog sitting, yard work, run errands for the elderly or handicap, teach non-tech savy people (usually elderly) how to become social media buffs to stay connected with their friends and family, etc. Go to your local library and ask if they need part time help. Contact your High School guidance counselor for a list of local businesses that hire students. Put word out with everyone you know that you're looking for work. Earning money: Be an entrepreneur, teen tycoon, your own boss. Stop by local fire stations, medical offices, law offices, any business really, and ask them if they'd be interested in having a homemade lunch/dinner made and delivered to them at work. Sit down with a parent first, and brainstorm a basic menu of easy to make meal items: (sandwiches, cookies, chips, cup cakes, burritos, pizza-by-the-slice, etc.). The parent who does most of the grocery shopping would know your cost to buy/make/package these items, and help you figure out a reasonable \u201cmarkup\u201d to charge. If you have about $300, or a parent will lend it to you, Google search \u201ccandy vending machines\u201d. I used to buy brand new \u201c3 selection\u201d candy machines from a company out of NY, for $250 each. The kind you put Skittles, Gumballs, Mike & Ikes candy in and people put a quarter in and get a small amount of candy. It's easy to fill up (buy bulk bags of candy from Costco or Smart & Final), and lots of law offices, real estate offices, and dozens of other businesses will let you put it in their lobby, no charge to you because it's an added convenience to them and their customers. A good location will make you $100 to $250 each month, as long as you keep the candy stocked, but even a slow location should make $50 or more. Requires very little work, and a small investment. Place 3 to 5 machines and you're \u201cearning money\u201d, baby! ",

            "answer_text": "There are several ways to make money online that are enjoyable and profitable. One way to make money is focusing your attention on reoccurring income. What am I trying to say here is: Everyone knows what an ATM machine is. Let me be clear because what I am going to say in the next sentence is opposite to ATM. If/When you want money, you go to an ATM machine. Now, if you want to make reoccurring income, then you need a soda machine. So, bottom line: One machine you take money out (which is your own) and another is where you put money in (soda machine or product dispenser). That\u2019s the one you want! Now, if you think for a moment, what would be the ultimate Product Dispenser where you would do a lot of fun and enjoyable work yet at the same time make money (all at the same time). There is only one answer to this question. It\u2019s called a membership site. Yes, a membership site. What is a membership site? Its a site that dispenses information, but can be shielded with a pay wall, very similar to a soda machine. Now, in this case, I use the product soda. Soda is the product YOU receive after you either apply our credit card or money. The membership site is also about community on a subject matter that people desire to learn more via a community. The next problem or question is, what can be dispensed? The answer is anything digital. Now, the fun and profitable membership site is not your one trick pony blueprint. The best kind of product to dispense are products that solve a problem or problems, products that people are interested in, and products that actually promise to do what they are said to do. Now for the fun part. Now the value part, so read this very carefully and I ask that you give me a good grade on my answer here. You are probably thinking, hey- how much is thing going to cost me and what do I need to get started? Do I need web hosting? Answer; Yes. Do I need a domain name and can I get one for free? Answer: Yes. Do I need a cPanel and word press? Answer: Yes. Can I get all of these things for free and actually launch a Membership site on a Word Press platform for free? Answer: Yes. Plus, get help from your peers all at the same time.- For FREE! So, I presume that your next question would be how, where, who and is this true? Answer: If you are not willy nillie and are Truly- interested in making your own soda machine, (in any niche) then click here and I promise you will get everything that I have described. Check it out for yourself. ",
