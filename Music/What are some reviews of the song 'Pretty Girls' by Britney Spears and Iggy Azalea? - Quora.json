            "answer_text": "Iggy Azalea is one of the worst singers/rappers out there, gave the song a single listen, I hated it when it reached the first 30 seconds. The verse is meaningless, I don't even know if Britney even tried, I still remember her when I first saw her video and had a huge crush on her. This music is annoying. I am happy that there are still singers like Lana Del Rey who makes good music. Final Verdict::3/10 - UGLY GIRLS! ",
