            "answer_text": "Fruity Loops Studio 10 is a DAW - a Digital Audio Workstation; and like every other music production software it requires time, and patience to understand how it actually  works. I started using Ableton Live 9 almost a year and a half ago. I didn't know what to do with it, but I learned something new each day, and the most important thing is that I kept at it. A day wouldn't go by without me meddling with samples, or creating a midi pattern, adding effects, amps and mastering tracks. I slowly started to watch YouTube tutorials - keep in mind that some of them are really really boring and they will only make you lose interest. There is not secret recipe to producing music, it's just you and the software battling each-other until one of you loses.  After a year of going at it, creating tracks every now and then, a small record label found me on Reddit, and on the 6th of March I released my first album. Is it great? No. Did it sell? Mediocrely. Will I continue to make more music? Hell yes. I don't know even a quarter of what Ableton can actually do, and I don't think I'll fully understand it, but it's the journey that counts. Besides Fruity Loops, and Ableton there are other Digital Audio Workstations. There isn't such a thing as the best one, it depends on what music sequencer software you get accustomed to, what suits your workflow, what's more intuitive for you. Try out a bunch of programs, and settle down with one once you think it's the time. But you should know that you'll need to learn some music theory in order to compose music. Don't think that once you've found out how to mix samples in a program you're automatically a musician. It takes time, for some even decades, to fully understand what note goes where, and how long shall it last. ",

            "answer_text": "Million Dollar Answer it is, Well! No one knows how to make music from the begin. You need to go into making music with the objective of having some good times and picking up something, not with making the artful culmination which will be your heritage. In the event that you put too high an objective on yourself, at that point you will close everything down with self-analysis before you even begin. Analysis, don't be reluctant to make silly music, terrible music, unlistenable music, particularly when beginning and haven't discovered your voice.
