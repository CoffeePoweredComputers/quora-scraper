            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re referring to the standard verse, chorus, verse, chorus (repeat if necessary), then the answer is that there are millions of them that don\u2019t have anything like that structure. Probably \u201cmost\u201d of them would be in the genre of progressive rock (although not always)\u2026.so let\u2019s go there\u2026. Genesis - Supper\u2019s Ready - 20+ minutes with no choruses. (often referred to as the greatest prog piece of all time, but bests and worsts are always subjective. Genesis - Firth of Fifth (a bit shorter, but brilliant - guitar solo is my personal favourite) Pink Floyd - Comfortably Numb (verse 1. verse 2, verse 1b verse 2b\u2026followed by a brilliant guitar solo to take it out. Jethro Tull - Thick as a Brick (full version - 40+ minutes) The ones in the other answers are great as well. But suffice to say, there\u2019s an enormous number of them out there ",

            "answer_text": "What are some good Rock songs without a chorus? Ray Davies sometimes writes songs that do not have a typical song structure. The song \u201cTwentieth Century Man\u201d by The Kinks from their 1971 classic Muswell Hillbillies is an example.  Lyrics: This is the age of machinery,A mechanical nightmare,The wonderful world of technology,Napalm, hydrogen bombs, biological warfare, This is the twentieth century,But too much aggravationIt's the age of insanity,What has become of the green pleasant fields of Jerusalem. Ain't got no ambition, I'm just disillusionedI'm a twentieth century man but I don't wanna be here.My mama said she can't understand meShe can't see my motivationJust give me some security,I'm a paranoid schizoid product of the twentieth century. You keep all your smart modern writersGive me William ShakespeareYou keep all your smart modern paintersI'll take Rembrandt, Titian, Da Vinci and Gainsborough, Girl we gotta get out of hereWe gotta find a solutionI'm a twentieth century man but I don't want to die here. I was born in a welfare stateRuled by bureaucracyControlled by civil servantsAnd people dressed in greyGot no privacy, got no libertyCos the twentieth century peopleTook it all away from me. Don't wanna get myself shot downBy some trigger happy policeman,Gotta keep a hold on my sanityI'm a twentieth century man but I don't wanna die here. My mama says she can't understand meShe can't see my motivationAin't got no security,I'm a twentieth century man but I don't wanna be here. This is the twentieth centuryBut too much aggravationThis is the edge of insanityI'm a twentieth century man but I don't wanna be here. ",
