            "answer_text": "No K-pop concerts in 2021.Although there might be concerts in the later half of the year, I assume covid protocols will still exist so a \u2018normal' concert wouldn't actually be possible. There are hopes of a vaccine in the early part of 2021 but distribution takes time so yeah. BTS will get nominated for a Grammy.Dynamite felt like a Trojan Horse to the American GP. With a catchy, happy song they caught the required attention for their MOTS:7 and next albums to be taken seriously. And as Grammys are heavily being accused of being racist now, I wouldn't be surprised if they have to break the \u2018No Grammy for Boygroup/band' rule to mend their image to show how diverse they are. A worldwide hit like Dynamite and Gangnam Style but not necessarily from BTS.I just have this feeling that we might get another Gangnam Style from an unexpected group. It might be the BigBang or 2Ne1 reunion, a BP or Exo mega comeback, a Stray Kids or Txt bop or something totally unexpected from a low-key group we don't know about. Dispatch will expose atleast two idol relationships.I am betting a couple from big groups might get revealed next year. January might be the month. Dispatch has been too quiet. Blackpink might have their peak in 2021.We all trashed Yg's marketing for Blackpink but this marketing was the main reason why there was so much hype in the first place. With scarcity of comebacks, Blinks starved for music related content for months on end which created immaculate push for their next comeback. But now as they are getting frequent comebacks we might witness a downfall in this hype. I assume their album sales will be steady and high, East Asia will still love them the same but they will reach their peak in the West. I don't think we will see much interaction of the 97-line anymore.After the Itaewon scandal, it wouldn't be a surprise to me if they keep their distance from each other in front of the camera. More 3rd generation idols get into acting.Due to Covid, the schedules of idols are not as tightly packed as they used to be thus, giving them time to involve themselves more into their hobbies. I expect Taehyung, Tzuyu, Nayeon to get into their acting career. Jin might not enlist in 2021.Bighit are pushing for a OT7 military enlistment in 2025 so I wouldn't be surprised if Jin's enlistment date is pushed even further. We might get to know about a second AOA\u2019s Jimin from a different group.I am sure cases of bullying exists in many groups, especially girl groups. Whether it be a news panel that's revealing it or the victim I think we might get to know more about dark sides of the industry. I don't see Everglow growing much.I don't think they are really good performers except Mia and as new groups from Big3 start debuting they wouldn't be able to keep up the hype. Black Swan will fade.I'm okay with non-asians debuting but majority of K-pop fans aren't. They wouldn't hate them but I think Black Swan will be ignored after some time. According to me, many groups might disband in 2021.AOA(The most obvious one)Weki MekiGOT7(I have doubts about this one again. They are getting a comeback soon so I have my hopes up that they won't disband.)DiaGugudanHave a Yiren because answers with no pictures don't work for me.  ~Ballet ",

            "answer_text": "Okey dokey. Bighits new girl group will debut and have a very successful debut beating out the success of \u2018Crown\u2019 by TXTI believe this because this will be bighit second girl group bighit debuts (First being GLAM) after 10 whole years. And I know that alot of Armys and even other Kpop fans are both curious and excited for what this girl group will be like. Bighits girl group will win female rookie of the yearTXT stole the spot of Male rookie of the year in 2019, and with the companies overall popularity and the added fanbases of TXT and BTS I would be surprised by this at all. RM will reveal that he is in a relationship or the news will be exposed by a fan or dispatchAlot of Armys have noticed that Namjoon wears one particular ring alot of the time and many speculate it being a promise ring which are popular amongst korean couples. And how Namjoons have been hinting at the fact that he has a desire to start a family soon with comments of wanting to become a dad etc. In all honesty I wouldn't be suprised if hes already married and has a child. Blackpinks comeback will depend on how sucessful the new girl groups debut isI've got a feeling that if YG Entertainments new girl groups debut is an instant success. They will pull what SM did to F(X) when redvelvet debuted and just focus on the new group rather than blackpink. They most likely will have their yearly comeback, but it would be a disappoint in comparison to this year's album release. BTS\u2019s comeback will be another big sucessI believe there fame will fade in 2022. South Korean government will announce that BTS will not have to Enlist.This has been a long going debate and as of recent the korean public are begining to realise the impact that BTS are having towards the countries economy and are opening to the idea of BTS being exempt in order to continue with there career. Jins enlistment has already been confirmed to be delayed to December 2021. Alternatively, the South Korean government will make Enlistment optional to BTS, they will choose to Enlist.Alternatively they may be allowed a choice on whether or not they wish to enlist or persue there career. I believe in order to avoid backlash the boys will choose to enlist.  More Predictions Bighit will host a female version of I-landThere has been alot of debate on social media about what bighit is going to do with the I-Land structure now that the show is over and Enphyen will be debuting (I really hope I spelt that right). Some have been saying that Bighit will used the building to host a survival show for there new girl group, and you know what I agree with this statement. Building such a huge structure to just not use it again is just a huge amount of money lost, I believe if I-Land was going to be a one off they would of made the place smaller and less expensive. I believe they will announce later in this year that they will host I-Land Season 2 for there new girl group. ** I also believe that the new girl group will most likely have Source Music Trainees aswell. The Global Plus Auditions went from Jan-October 2019. Which means the trainees would only have just a year's worth of training before debuting, which is pretty risk if this is for all of the members.
