            "answer_text": "This is a very difficult question. I don't have a definitive answer, but here are some of my favourites. I've tried to have some variety in this list, which is in no particular order. So, without further ado: Welcome Home (Sanitarium)Atmospheric and brilliant - this is probably my favourite \u201cballad\u201d of theirs. Never has chorused guitar sound so cool. Ride the LightningThis song has an awesome extended solo in the middle, and really conveys the anger, sadness and apprehension of a criminal on death row. Frayed Ends of SanityI never used to like this song all that much, but it's definitely a grower! Once again, this song conveys its subject matter brilliantly and memorably. Wherever I May RoamHands down the best song on the Black Album. The twelve string intro, awesome solo and memorable riff make this song stand out. The Outlaw TornLoad is unfairly hated in my opinion, but I love its eclectic combination of hard rock, blues, and country music. This song is incredible - a ten minute journey with unrivaled atmosphere and impact. I really like how the verses drop down to just bass and drums, a rarity in Metallica's catalogue. Metal MilitiaA straightforward thrash metal number, but awesome nonetheless. It brilliantly caps off their first album. All Nightmare LongDeath Magnetic saw Metallica return to the style they helped define, yet they still make it sound fresh and exciting. This song is great, 'nuff said. CyanideCyanide combines AJFA-esque thrash metal with a Pantera-like groove, and by God it works. OneThis song rapidly switches between moods - subdued, frustrated and finally angry - yet it never feels forced or clunky. The lyrics are dark and haunting, and Hetfield is on top form. OrionTheir best instrumental in my opinion. I particularly love its spacey middle section built around Burton's bass line. St. AngerHey, don't judge me! The album isn't perfect, but aside from a few tracks (Invisible Kid is shite) I enjoy it. The title track reveals Hetfield's fractured state of mind, suddenly switching from calm and subdued to loud and angry. The lyrics may be a bit repetitive, but I still love it. ",

            "answer_text": "My top 10 favourite Metallica song might be: Whenever I May Roam, you can clearly hear powerful backing vocal from Newsted and powerful drumming from LarsThe Unforgiven, the lyrical theme and the music video gave me chillThe Day That Never Comes, for me it is a great song that successfully being released in the modern era of the band. I really love the lyrics and softer voice of JamesThe Memory Remains, every single time i listen to this song, all i want is to sing along. Fortune, fame. Mirror vain. Gone insane. But the memory remains!Leper Messiah, this song really describing about how people claim themselves as a saviour, it happens in my country and this song really suits the situationMaster of Puppets, what can i say? Don't do drugs kids!Creeping Death, i love how Metallica went from thrashy lyrics into more musical and historical themed lyrics like this one. Die by my hand!And Justice For All, this 9-minutes long masterpiece makes me agree every single time when listening to this song. The political lyrics and sadness in our government, that's a great pointHero of the Day, a very underrated song from underrated album. I can feel James' softer and emotional voice from this song and the albumSad But True, DO YOU WANT HEAVY???? METALLICA GIVES YOU HEAVY BABYYY!Another list that deserves a honourable mention: Enter SandmanOneHere Comes RevengeThe Unforgiven IIINothing Else MattersThe Thing That Should Not BeThe Four HorsemenBatteryBlackenedThe God That Failed Getting stronger for 38 years!
