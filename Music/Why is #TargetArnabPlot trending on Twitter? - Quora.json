            "answer_text": "The government there has got no other way than trying to silence Arnab Goswami since he is the one who talks about Sushant\u2019s case and is going to investigate on the lynching of sadhus in Palghar. Like how, the bollywood celebrities did abettment of Sushant to commit suicide, now they want to kill Arnab Goswami as he is revealing the government, Bollywood celebrities, lynching of sadhus etc.,. This is purely a vendetta against Arnab Goswami by all of them. 'Arnab will get trapped': Nawab Malik says in sting \"He is stuck in the TRP thing now. Let me tell you clear cut. He will get trapped. I am telling you clear cut,\" says Nawab Malik in the sting almost predicting the course of the investigation by the Mumbai Police and hinting that everything so far is pre-planned. \"The thing is that man will get a lot of problems. I am scared that what if he goes into...a zone himself. This is madness. It becomes a phobia. It gets created after a point of time,\" he added. Malik adds \"He (Arnab Goswami) is driving himself mad. I am scared what if he commits suicide. What is happening is, the path he has taken, he sits inside (the studio) and is self-imposed. He thinks that the world works like this only and suddenly when he gets to know that there is nothing and everything is fake, then a person can do anything, right' He thinks that the whole system should work the way his mind wants and that he can do everything and anything but when it does not happen, the person goes into a different zone, right'\" Taking to Twitter, Dr Swamy responded to a user and pointed out that the Maharashtra government was readying a spin script similar to the one circulated for the death of Sushant Singh Rajput and hinted that it was being done so to hide the role of Dubai-based gang allegedly trying to hide the truth.
