            "answer_text": "I love music and many of my memories are tied are tied to either music or scent. As the question asks about music that's how I'll answer. I'd like to tell you about two or three poignant memories, about poignant happenings in my life. I was listening to my car radio, driving to my home. I was listening to Henryk Gorecki - Symphony No. 3. I arrived and sat in the driveway until the music ended which was a very long time. I cried through the entire piece because of the unbelievable beauty of the music and the story of its creation. Mr. Gorecki, a Polish composer, had been asked to compose a symphony based on the second world war. He refused saying that that couldn't be done but finally he visited a concentrated camp and saw on a wall a young girl's prayer for death. She wished for her death and deliveraberance to heaven, to see beauty and flowers again. This is one of the most deeply touching symphonies ever written and I suggest you all listen to it. Have your Kleenex at your side.When I was diagnosed with MS I had such an extreme case of Optic Neuritis that I was barely able to see. My husband dropped me off at my friends house as she was waiting to hear what the Neurologist had to say. As I was getting steadily worse she cried when she saw me and I cried because I was terrified (I don't cry in front of.my family) . She led me to her back garden, fixed me a drink and put on John Coltrane, a Softer Side. Then we listened to Pilgrim, Eric Clapton and Robbie Robertson. It was a surreal evening but the music and her company were very soothing.3. My father's funeral as so painful but a little Puccini during the service helped a lot. Love, love, Puccini.",

            "answer_text": "Too, too many. Almost all my songs bring back some sort of memory, not because the lyrics or the song relate to my situation, but because I listened to this particular song a lot during that time in my life. Lion Heart by Girls\u2019 Generation - A K-Pop song. Most my songs are K-Pop. But it reminds me of two things \u2014 one is being in Paris, because I downloaded the song while I was still there and listened to it constantly. The other is the beginning of my senior year of high school. I had just gotten my first car and I always, always listen to music while driving. Lion Heart played all the time. It reminds me of the feeling of being a senior, having a car, and driving to school, and sometimes driving home with friends on a nice September afternoon. Also finally being able to stop by Dunkin\u2019 Donuts when I wanted before heading to school. Good times. Why Did I Have To Fall In Love With You? by DBSK - One of my all-time favorite songs. I don\u2019t know what it reminds me of that makes me so happy. Maybe that summer during middle school where I stayed home every day, able to relax, when I had just gotten into Korean music and shows. I laughed my butt off every day while watching their variety shows, fan-girled over DBSK, downloaded new songs, practiced their choreography. Down (feat. Lil\u2019 Wayne) & Do You Remember by Jay Sean - Both these songs remind me of my summer vacation both before and after 6th grade, when I had just moved to a new apartment and started hanging out with the other kids my age who lived there. I had a crush on one of them and we hung out almost every day at our apartment complex\u2019s park, or we\u2019d play hide and seek and use the whole complex, it was a ton of fun. After a while he had a crush on me too and it was just a happy time. ",
