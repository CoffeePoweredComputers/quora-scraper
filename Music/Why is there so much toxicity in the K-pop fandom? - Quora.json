            "answer_text": "Ok, this isn\u2019t the same for all fans, but for me, yes, a lot of it is. My mental health definitely deteriorated after getting deep into the fandom, but if you are planning to join, here are some things you should avoid: *THIS IS MY EXPERIENCE I BY NO MEANS SPEAK FOR THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY* -TWITTER- do not, I repeat do not, go to kpop stan twitter. It feels like getting thrown into a den of wolves. If you really, really want to, make sure to only follow accounts you agree with, or those who aren\u2019t mean, and make sure to stay nice yourself, otherwise you\u2019re a goner. -THE BAD SIDE OF YOUTUBE- This can be characterized by one thing- unpopular pop opinions. I enjoyed them at first, but then realized the constant hate in them is just, awful. There are some good videos out there, but there's definitely a bad side. -SOME OF INSTAGRAM- personally, for kpop, insta is the best place. you\u2019ll find some awfulness out there but you can ignore it (mostly by blocking people). Things not to avoid: -PINTEREST- you get a lot of pics of your idols without the toxicity. you don\u2019t get the social interaction, but with some kpop stans, that might be for the best. I have yet to face hate on Pinterest. -TUMBLR- I like to think kpop and memes is the only good thing to come out of tumblr, but I digress. again, this one is very low on social interaction, so you get the pics without the hate. -AMINO- high on social interaction, average on content. I find it hard to avoid creeps with this one but if you want that community without the awfulness of twitter, this ones for you. You might go through a koreaboo phase, which isn\u2019t great, just try to be less public about it, trust me, it will save you from too much embarrassment later on. One thing to remember is to not get offended if someone has a differing opinion. If you disagree with them you can go ahead and try to say something like \u201cthey\u2019re improving!\u201d or \u201cbut what about their vocals in this performance?\u201d but most of the time, it is what it is. You\u2019re not going to change their mind and they're entitled to their opinion. Please stay nice, especially if someone says something you disagree with. Don\u2019t let this discourage you from listening to the music though! It\u2019s just the fandom that can be a bit creepy. ",
