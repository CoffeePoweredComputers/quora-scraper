            "answer_text": "As everyone points out, they don\u2019t make as much as they claim. But why do they claim to? Last year there was interesting YouTube phenomenon where a bunch of hip-hop fan YouTubers mailed out to a bunch of currently trendy rappers to ask how much they charged for a feature. Here\u2019s an example :  And a lot of other people started doing the same thing. What\u2019s interesting here is that hip-hop today is all about \u201cfeatures\u201d (rappers providing guest bars on the tracks of other rappers.) This makes hip-hop into a kind of \u201cnetwork\u201d or \u201cweb\u201d art-form. But this network is also very monetized. It\u2019s effectively an \u201cattention economy\u201d where hot new artists are charging between $15,000 and $100,000 dollars for appearing on someone else\u2019s record. That\u2019s a sizeable chunk of cash. And it\u2019s not being paid for \u201cartistic\u201d reasons. It\u2019s being paid by newer, less well known but ambitious artists, who are buying the extra attention that the more established rapper will bring to their project by providing a feature on it. If you manage to grab some attention and fame (which seems to be called \u201cclout\u201d in the industry), then the features market is a way to monetize that. By selling yourself as a guest (and dispensing some of your attention) on other rappers\u2019 tracks. But of course, now ask yourself why all the rappers are FAKING being rich in their videos. Isn\u2019t it just a tired clich\u00e9 by now? The cars and mansions and girls and gold and diamonds and expensive bubbly wine? Everyone knows it\u2019s not true. That these are rented props. You probably wonder why the hell today\u2019s young people are so moronically consumerist and obsessed by material wealth; when, traditionally, young people have always had a certain amount of healthy disdain for such things. Don\u2019t any of these smart, talented rappers (and even in the age of mumble rap, you don\u2019t get to be a successful rapper if you aren\u2019t smart) have ideals and independent thoughts? Well, the answer might be more logical than you imagined. Hip-hop is not just a ruthlessly monetized attention economy, it\u2019s an attention fuelled pyramid scheme. Rappers are earning their money not from streaming or selling albums. These pay almost nothing. They are getting their income from the next tier of the pyramid down, the n00bs who are desperate to buy their way into and up the pyramid. And if that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s obvious why there\u2019s so much formulaic ostentation and bragging in rap videos and lyrics. When you look rich in your video, you are signalling to potential customers (ie. the next generation of rappers) how successful you are. Which can raise the perceived value of a feature from you. Even if the next generation of rappers knows that it\u2019s all a game and largely faked. They can still assume that there\u2019s some handicap principle at work, keeping the signalling somewhat honest. After all, even renting cars and jewellery costs something. And it\u2019s likely that if you have been picked up as a promising young rapper by a label or management company, they have already invested in you by buying features from the better known rappers. So now, you are going to need to boost your own apparent value, and earn back that money, by pimping yourself out on a bunch of features to the next tier, before you stop being so hot and lose your clout. Beyond a pyramid scheme, it could well be an investment bubble. As wannabe management companies are pouring money in, to buy their artists attention to boost them up the pyramid. And THAT would explain why rappers seem to be making so much money. Firstly money is fuelling their rise up the attention pyramid. But like all pyramid schemes, the moment people decided to stop believing in it, the whole thing collapses and the bubble bursts. So rappers are pretending to be earning even more money than they are, because this is the only thing that keeps the bubble expanding rather than collapsing. ",

            "answer_text": "That is largely a fallacy. Fewer and fewer artists actually make revenue from the sales of their songs, especially big label artists, because alot of it is taken upfront. The songwriters, mixers, masters, stylists, directors for the videos etc\u2026 Add to that, fewer and fewer people tend to buy songs and prefer to stream on services such as YouTube, Apple Music or Spotify and that takes a bit more change out of their pockets. Even with advertising, streaming revenues are somewhat small especially with all the aforementioned wanting a piece of the pie. There are some artists who do make money, but they are positioned differently, such as Dr. Dre and Jay-Z who own brands for example. Or producers like Pharell and Timbaland, because many artists go through them to get their songs made and they often take a percentage of that as a result. Again, it\u2019s largely an image and a perception thing. Except for a very select few artists at the top of their game, most musicians who makes it seem like they\u2019re rolling in it perhaps should be taken with a tiny pinch of salt! ",
