            "answer_text": "Love of repetition. Like toddlers. Some of these songs are not bad. Oldies, new pop, country pop, whatever it may be, though, it\u2019s incomprehensible to me how so many people can tolerate hearing the same freaking 40 songs over and over and freaking over again for weeks or months at a time. Don\u2019t they go to bed with the horror of these tunes playing back in their heads and awaken with them still there? And is this not unpleasant for them? Pop music is extreme torment to many of us, just to hear one of these calculatedly formulaic songs more than once or twice. Imagine the misery of the pop artists who have to go through rehearsals and endure grueling recording sessions and concerts where idiots cheer for something when they play, but not for the actual performers, just to make a living and enrich the cynical executives of the major pop music industry labels ? And top 40 oldies can be the worst remembrances of torment past. In public, such as at the grocery, in malls, on telephone hold, or even at work, such sonic assault is a mild but real punishment we have no choice but to endure in order to participate in the necessities of society at large. Are the minds of these typical people mentioned in other answers completely idle and insensate? I simply do not understand what is their particular malfunction. ",

            "answer_text": "Because some people have lives to live rather than spend hours on end looking for new hip hop crap. Most good oldies stations will play music covering 30 to 40 years, from the 50\u2019s to 80\u2019s. There is a whole lot of music to listen to without hearing a repeat in ten to twelve months. Finding new music might be something you enjoy doing, but your preferences are not necessarily the norm, especially when most of the new crap sucks. Quality music is good forever and not just generational. I could ask the same question in reverse - why do some people hate listening to good classic music, of any genre, of the past 40 years ? What's better, old music or new music? ",
