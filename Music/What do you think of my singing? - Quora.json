            "answer_text": "Hey Erika, thanks for the A2A. I just gave your clip a listen.   You do have a decent ear and while you are flat at a few parts, that can be easily fixed with practice; it happens to everyone even professional singers at times so I do not see it as much of an issue for your development. Not sure if I am right, but I feel you are holding back a bit at times, although part of it is probably because you are trying to stylise it a bit. It is not wrong to stylise, but to me you can still sing softly yet sounding free at the same time - that is a skill that can be learnt if you practice consistently. Learning a good breath support can also make your sound a lot more steady, because I notice that your pitch is wavering at some parts.  Overall, I believe you are on the right track. I recommend you to get a qualified vocal coach, preferably one with a degree in vocal pedagogy, that can help you get better. With regards to the audition, there is nothing in wrong in trying it out to see what you are made of - the experience and feedback will be highly critical for your development. ",

            "answer_text": "You have potential, but you should get vocal coaching.  I hear some nasality in your voice and also pitch issues - you tend to go flat - but a lot of your singing is also on-pitch, so it's likely something you can fix with practice.  I can't tell if you have the ability to sing longer phrases.  It seems like you are putting more effort into the style, so while I do hear a little vibrato, it's not long, but I think it's due to the styling you are putting in.  Your sound is unsteady by the end of phrases.  Breath support would help, and then you could soften those endings for the phrases and finish the notes out instead of cutting them short.  I think you could really benefit from voice lessons. That said, you should audition to get both experience and evaluation from other ears. ",
