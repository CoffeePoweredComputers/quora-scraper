But other people want us to change our behaviour and values to suit their needs and those of the society. This song is an open cry for those who want to follow their own path and not needing to be meeting the expectations of others. Numb is one of my favourite songs. ",

Ok, the lyrics are sinful and helpful if you\u2019re 16 and helpless. But almost all LP songs do this. Aaaand 80% of all music on earth. Don't get me wrong. Numb is a great Song from an, even greater, Band. But they\u2019ve got so much better guitar-riffs, or arrangements, or lyrics in thier other Songs. So why hyping Numb? Whyis this THE Song they\u2019re singing now Chester is passing? Confused\u2026.cheers\u270c\ufe0f ",
