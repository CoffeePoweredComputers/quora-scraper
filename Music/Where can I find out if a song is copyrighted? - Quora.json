Any song written after 1978 is DEFINITELY in copyright, even if no copyright form was filed. You can do a search at the Copyright Office/Library of Congress. You can even do an online search for songs written at least 15 years ago (they are kinda behind on filing things at the Library of Congress). ",

The songwriter does not need to register it to have Copyright. If you want to know if a particular song has been registered, you can do a search on the database on Copyright.gov ",
