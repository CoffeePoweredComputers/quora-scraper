            "answer_text": "A lot of the answers here have told you to listen to people who are not really \u2018country\u2019. But I guess depending on who you are and what you believe depends on what you class as country. As with all genres of music - they evolve over time. For example - ( I paraphrase from Tyler Mahan Coe ) = \u201cWaylon Jennings hated Garth Brooks for ruining country radio - but if you listen to what shit Luke Bryan puts out lately - it makes Garth look like Buck Owens\u201d. Every generation seems to think the newer country is not how it should be. I could list a load of artists I would deem as real country for you to check out (and feel free to do so), from Hank Snr to Waylon Jennings, Tammy Wynette to Merle Haggard, Patsy to Emmylou, Willie Nelson to early Johnny Cash, George Jones to the the Louvin Brothers.. but - I\u2019m gonna suggest another route into it just so you get the idea of what real country is. (There are also of course \u2018modern / neo traditionalists\u2019 such as Jamey Jonson, Sturgil Simpson, Ags Connolly, Hank 3\u2026) Anyway - there is a podcast that I have recently become obsessed with of which - and if your new to country or not - I hugely recommend checking out. Aside from learning loads (of unknown?) history about hugely famous \u2018country\u2019 artists, there are great suggestions of songs / artists to check out. It is called Cocaine and rhinestones. Cocaine & Rhinestones | The podcast about the History of Country Music Personally I am always interested in hearing an artists music a little more if I know a bit of background. Also - follow Saving Country Music to get an idea of what is going on in the country \u2018world\u2019. Have fun. PS - the people making the greatest country music are probably guys you\u2019ll never hear of - they are out there touring the underground circuits. ",
