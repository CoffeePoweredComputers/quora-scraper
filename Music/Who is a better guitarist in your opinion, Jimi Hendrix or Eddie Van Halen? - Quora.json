            "answer_text": "My opinion is pretty meaningless since I don\u2019t play guitar, but my impression is that Hendrix was better overall. I say this because, aside from technical ability, he had far greater range and creativity in his playing and compositions. He was also innovating the stuff that EVH eventually built on. Credit must always tip toward the innovator. EVH was building off not just Hendrix but Townshend, Clapton, Page\u2026 even Ace Frehley. All of this gave EVH a bigger toolbox from which to create, whereas Hendrix had to work from an early and more limited toolbox (Berry, King, Waters, Johnson). When you consider the short arc of Hendrix\u2019s career from the early days of session work and backing the Isley Brothers through 1970, and you consider the progression of his development in that time, he demonstrated much more than EVH did. I find EVH\u2019s work to be rather narrow. Whereas Hendrix played a ton of R&B, soul, Motown, folk, various rock, and more, EVH stayed pretty much within the hard rock genre from 1976-\u201982. I closed that at 1982 because it\u2019s only fair to compare EVH up until then, when he was the same age as when Hendrix died. Any EVH development past that becomes incomparable because we don\u2019t know what Hendrix would\u2019ve done past 1970. Despite this, I still have a hard time seeing EVH having developed much after 1982 to put him in Hendrix\u2019s range. You always know EVH\u2019s playing when you hear it; Hendrix, on the other hand, recorded a breadth of guitar work that, not knowing better, you could think came from many different guitarists. This means that EVH had an undeniable signature style, which is a good thing, but it seems to me a sign of his limits. Thanks for the A2A! ",

            "answer_text": "I have to admit I could never get into Hendrix. I am also not a huge Eddie Van Halen fan, but his playing on Van Halen I and II was truly superb. I mean, just take a listen to the solo in Ice Cream Man. I always felt that particular solo showed off his great sense of phrasing. Also check out songs like Panama and Unchained which have great rhythm parts as well as great lead phrasing. I think Hendrix was one of those players who you either like or don\u2019t like and there isn\u2019t much middle ground. Sort of like colors. Some people like yellow cars. I don\u2019t and there is no point trying to convince someone a yellow car is great if they simply don\u2019t like yellow cars. By the way, if you like EVH, you should check out stuff from the band White Lion who put out some great music in the late 80\u2019s, 90\u2019s. Their guitarist - Vito Bratta - was clearly influenced by Eddie but had his own unique phrasing. His solo in this song is truly awesome! The phrasing!  And of course their most popular song was Wait, which also has a great, very innovative solo:  Yeah, they were a glam band, but Vito is world class guitarist, as were a lot of the guitarists from glam bands.
