            "answer_text": "How do you become famous? - [Overnight Fame] I have seen many people ask on the internet how anyone can become famous overnight? OR how to become famous? OR how do I become famous?  But why do you want to become famous, there are many people including me, who don\u2019t want to become famous. We are good and famous in the eyes of our parents, siblings and friends. But, if you still want to become famous, then I will give you the most recent example of the young Egyptian girl named \u201cSarah Abouelkhair\u201d who became famous just by making an Instagram story. Is it really possible in today's world? what will you say? If I say \u201cYES\u201d. On Oct 22, 2018, the girl named \u201cSarah Abouelkhair\u201d did something, which shocked the whole social media - particularly Instagram & Facebook. Sarah (who has 35.1k Insta Followers) made an Instagram story named \u201cBBQ\u201d with a picture of official NASA logo and tagged NASA organization in her story, as you can check in the attached picture.  The whole Instagram story has 32 images. I will try my best to cut off the unnecessary images to reduce the post length. I think I don\u2019t need to explain everything mentioned in the images, you can better judge it by yourself and easily depict the whole idea, what she is trying to explain in those images. So the first picture starts with the most brilliant and Awesome idea, which she just got from nowhere but from her own mind (Her Instincts). She really wanted to give her brilliant idea to NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration). Sarah\u2019s original Quote: Hi, NASA. I have an Amazing idea for you. I won\u2019t change for it, although it\u2019s genius and I probably should.\u201d  LOL [Amazing Idea] for NASA\u2026. :) Check the 2nd image, in which she explained her idea a little bit more with proper image and text. What if before rocket launches - Hear me out? we put a giant Grill with tons of Chicken, Cow, and other Halal animals meat\u2026. :P  Like this, as shown in the attached image - Giant Grill - My personal question to Sarah is that how are we supposed to get the big giant grill?  Hahaha! When the engine of a space rocket starts, then Rocket engine produces thrust by the expulsion of an exhaust Fluid (Hydrogen Gas with a mixture of other lighter gases).  After that, the whole meat party will begin. \u201cLess Labor - More Flavour\u201d Cheesy Fiesta! She explained her logic in the given way; BBQ for Everyone in NASA! in less than a minute (60 seconds)  She didn\u2019t end up here. She explained the whole science with the idea. She said, that this idea will not stop here, this idea can also do the following: 5 Misconceptions or Myths of Sarah\u2019s Idea! Save Energy - More rockets, more baked chicken.It will end the World HungerIt will probably get her a decent job at NASA.It will increase the NASA productivity (better than SpaceX)It will reduce the overall cost of food on the day of the robot launching. In her Instagram story, she also asked the question to all of her followers in a more decent and stylish way. She asked - Should NASA Universe Education just hire me for my creative ideas on saving the World 1 BBQ at a time? NASA PLSHELL NO After that, she shared a screenshot of the private message, which she received from NASA after her story becomes viral on Instagram and Social media websites.  She also shared another message which she got from SpaceX (company) company.  She also shared another message which she got from it from BuzzFeed - BuzzFeed, Inc. is an American Internet media and news company based in New York City. They wanted to conduct an interview with her in order to cover the whole story. They also asked for her permission though. [Over night Success and Fame] - Right na?  Another message from Netflix (product) - they wanted to document the whole journey in an exclusive short when she will spend her day with SpaceX.  She even shared & attached the picture with her family including her parents which she took outside the Kennedy Space Center, Orlando.  Everyone was so confused at that point. How did the 2 most famous and biggest companies respond to her in just 1 or 3 days? OR how her story gets noticed by SpaceX and NASA, because every day, they received notifications of the tags that people used in which their names are present. But what was the actual story behind this amazing and creative idea?? no one knows exactly - Everyone just amazed, shocked and confused, just like me when I first saw her Insta story via my Friend\u2019s profile. Sarah\u2019s Instagram story also contained the message of \u201cEllen\u201d - TheEllenShow Host (The EllenShow features comic Ellen DeGeneres in the studio performing an opening monologue and interviewing guests who include celebrities, newsmakers and ordinary people with extraordinary talents. )  Just check her overall excitement, when she got famous in just 10 minutes after getting an overwhelming response from SpaceX, NASA, Netflix, Outback, Buzzfeed and TheEllenShow.  Let me tell you something (To all of my viewers) Actually, all the screenshots were real. She got those Instagram messages in a real-time. She has over 35.1K Instagram followers and with her story of All tags related to NASA, SpaceX, BBQ, and the amazing Idea got her a massive influence of people out there. This is the power of Social media, which we cannot neglect in today\u2019s world. There are many examples of these types of fame, success, and stardom. Many people become Millionaire, celebrities, models, etc. by using Social Media influence and power. The given attached picture will clear all your confusions and misconceptions about her.  So actually, she was performing a social experiment to let the world know about the futility and influence of social media, and how social media can be used to promote fake or hyped news.  After the whole social experiment, she also sent a message to NASA official account and explained the whole experiment which was conducted at that time.  But her social experiment gave her a huge fame, success, and influence from the world\u2019s most powerful companies and influential people. After 4 to 5 days of the experiment, she also got offered amazing gifts from major companies\u2026\u2026[ANY IDEA CAN BE BIG & AMAZING]  Check the attached screenshot containing the message of \u201cSalma El Bouyahyaoui (@namelessamlas) \u2022 Instagram photos and videos\u201d  In this way, she got new Instagram followers and her followers keep increasing now. I will definitely say that it was the Best Social Experiment I have ever seen in my life that took the whole new level. Congrats to Sarah AbulKhair (https://www.instagram.com/sarahabulkhair/).

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll answer this for school, roughly 11\u201318 and female. Generally popular girls are pretty and blonde. The \u2018queen bee\u2019 specially is the prettiest and is blonde. At my school, you had to care about your grades, so you work hard and try to make the teachers like you. This doesn\u2019t mean that you have to get straight As, but you need to be within the top 25%. You have a large group of friends and you\u2019re all in the sports teams together, ideally as many as possible. The most popular girl at my school was in every team by the time she left. I think this was specific to my school, but there was a metal badge system, one per sport or club. To get these, you needed to represent the school at an event and attend the meetings regularly. Aim to get as many as possible, ideally the sports ones and a few others. If you can\u2019t get one, pick up any you find around school, or ask teachers that like you if they have any in their desk drawers. If there\u2019s a uniform, shorten your skirt, tuck your blouse in enough, but not too much. Wear short socks and lace up shoes. As you\u2019re sporty, you have lots of pairs of bright, Nike trainers, and you get new pairs regularly. Unlike currently, the trainers are all thin and not clumpy. Have the coolest backpack - lots of bright colours, but either remove the brand name or ensure it isn\u2019t traceable - you don\u2019t want anyone else to find/have the same one as you. During non school uniform days, wear clothes that are on trend, and well kept. Ideally, you would have clothes that no one else has. If it is a themed day, go all out. take pictures of these, with you in the middle and put them on your social media. As you\u2019re the head of your friendship group, you need to be loud and sociable all the time. You need to ensure that you have a few interesting stories to tell about you at any time, for all conversations. If you have lots of siblings, this\u2019ll help. People at my school were always more popular if they had lots of siblings - 2 or 3 being ideal. Say hi to your siblings and their friends in the corridors. Most important: identify anyone who might threaten your existence and welcome them into your group. for example, there was a girl I knew who was insanely jealous of the most popular girl, was on the fringes of the group & would\u2019ve spread rumours about her etc. This girl had no siblings and was a spoilt and lonely girl. everything the most popular girl had, she wanted. So, what you do is make her your best friend. become inseparable: do all your lessons together, invite her to your house, call her your sister, share your snacks, let her choose the classroom music, ask her to help you with your homework, let her play with your hair etc. If there are some people on the edge of your group, who you don\u2019t think like you as much as you\u2019d like them to, treat them in a similar way for a week or so, to strengthen their friendship with you. at the same time, try to make the rest of the class like you. do silly things in lessons that make them laugh. volunteer for science experiments in class, chat to them about whether or not you\u2019re getting an exercise correct, show off how neat your work/ planner (diary) is, show off your tan, chat about the funny thing one of your siblings did at the weekend etc. A good trick is to annoy the teacher until they\u2019re exasperated and then behave beautifully for the next 15 minutes and repeat. Other things to note: always be on time for lessons - a few minutes early is idealhaving straight hair is helpful, as it\u2019ll always look neatwear several bracelets at all times, so you can fiddle with them in lessonsget people to play with your hair if you\u2019re not being noticeddo daring things - sit on top of the lockers, walk across the desks, leave campus at lunch (forbidden) etc.have lots of delicious snackshave a link to a far away (ideally hot) country, go there often, in your winteras above, get tanned easilybe tall and thincomplete all homework on time - bonus if it\u2019s in the lesson or day it was set in, and store it neatly - no crumpled edgeshave neat handwriting, pretend you don\u2019t like itmove seats in lessons where the teacher won\u2019t mind/noticewrite in the wrong coloured pen and then tell the teacher it was an accidenthave new, cool stationery - rearrange it in lessons that bore you, ideally no one else would have stationery like yours, so lots of people ask to use/fiddle with it and want to know where it\u2019s from. better still if you let a pen roll across the desk, so more people noticehave a rich family (like the sibling thing, I don\u2019t know why this is important but it is)go on holiday often - ski in winter, beach in summer, other holidays in betweeninvite lots of friends for sleepovers, ideally 4 + at onceAll in all, you need to make sure you have lots of friends that like you, both in your year and other years. You need to set the trends and be slightly ahead of the curve in everything. Be slightly disruptive, but not too much. Make sure the teachers all like you. Ensure you lead what looks like a charmed life, and most importantly - appear to do all of the above with ease. ",

            "answer_text": " I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re thinking of showbusiness so here goes: Make an honest list of your talents and shortcomings and work on perfecting yourself. Take music lessons and train your voice. Learn to read sheet music. Lots of pop musicians can\u2019t read music, but you\u2019ll have more independence if you can and it\u2019ll help with songwriting. Take acting classes. See as much live theatre and live concert performance as you can. I used to live in a house-share with 2 fledgling actors and a young lady who really wanted to be a singer. She could sing quite well but never got anywhere because she wasn\u2019t playing the game right. Showbusiness is really hard to break into. You have to keep on and on pushing and be persistent: play the long game. Elvis Presley, the Beatles and Madonna were all turned down and faced rejections at the beginning of their careers. Don\u2019t rely on any one person. Judge people on results, not empty promises. Stay away from drugs, they\u2019ve never helped anyone\u2019s career. Know the business (find out as much as you can). The world is changing. Think about learning a foreign language. It could open up all kinds of doors. E.g. suppose you have blond hair and blue eyes and yet speak fluent Chinese \u2014 as an actor you\u2019d be filling a niche in a potentially lucrative overseas marketplace). If you have any talent for writing you can use this \u2014 not just for songwriting, but you could write your own movies. Professional-grade equipment is easy to come by and you can now edit a film digitally on a computer. It\u2019s possible to make a pretty good movie for a few thousand dollars, so this is something you could think about. And you need to be businesslike. If you do make that movie, you don\u2019t sell it outright. You cut deals where people buy distribution rights in certain territories for a certain number of years. Social media of course is the way to get noticed nowadays. If you can get yourself a whole crowd of followers you\u2019ve got your foot half in the door already. If you\u2019re interested in working in TV as a presenter or host, most of these people are professional journalists. Usually you would start off as a researcher and work your way up. Even entry-level jobs are hard to get in TV so the way in is via voluntary work where you can help out and you get to see how a TV production is actually made. As a presenter you\u2019re not just working in front of the camera but behind it as well. You\u2019d quite possibly be required to write your own scripts and you need to know how to edit your own work on a computer. Re television I\u2019m speaking from experience by the way. Years ago I worked at a TV station in a voluntary capacity. I wrote factsheets (this was before everyone had the internet) and answered the phone. We got to watch the local news as it was going out. TV studios are much smaller in reality than they look on screen. There are some good courses out there that will teach you the technical aspects of TV and internet journalism. In closing I would say remember fame is fickle, showbusiness and the media are intensely competitive fields. Even if you reach the top, nobody stays there for ever. Being famous must be pretty tiring. (No wonder so many of the top stars want to go into early retirement!) ",

Create an account in twitter and start to follow Donald Trump, the president of The United States of America since 2017. This is a great beginning. From here, become popular has to be easy. With time, you will see what I mean.  Kathy Griffin is her name. I always say the same thing when it comes about answer these kind of questions. Be extreme. Act low, very low in your actions. I can name personalities but I will limit myself in \u201cprofessions\u201d. -Invent a new religion and expose it everywhere you go. Religion, we like it or not, is popular. A very popular subject.  -Involve yourself in politics from now. Politic is very popular today. Everywhere you go, there is politic. Study it if you don't know much about it. Go and study the history of politic. What's on fire now. Now, here is where the fun begin. Expose every of your thoughts in every social media. Twitter is my favourite because the use is simple. Create an account and invent a logo.  Emma Stone singing \u201cI will survive\u201d in protest against Donald Trump. If you aren't good with words, go out and join every manifestations. Search for the cameras. Stay in front of the cameras. Become the voice and the leader somehow of the movement. Be extreme in front of the cameras.  If there is not movement, invent it. Pay attention to the social problems of today and start from here. If you're still in high school, the same. Look what is the big deal in your high school and do something to reverse it. Be the leader. The voice.  -If you want something more simple and not something that requires too much work from you, grab your camera and think about the most disgusting thing you can record with your camera. Or the most funny thing. If it's snowing outside, go out naked, full naked and record yourself. If you can appear dancing in the video, better. Put a song in it. Then share it. In every possible social media.  -Invent a creepy story and make it seem very real. If there is pictures, better. Be the author of the story. Share it. Everywhere. Spread the story. Did you hear the \"Russian experiment\u201d?.  No seriously, if become popular is what you desire, be extreme. I don\u2019t know why you want to be popular but somehow, I can understand it. The need to feel and see that we matter is in our gen. I prefer privacity, though. ",

            "answer_text": "This can be a long one but useful: Learn the exact characteristics and behaviors that will let people like you: Most people want to be socially desirable and do everything they can to make that happen. Yet, despite their sincere efforts, they often are not effective in increasing their popularity. Even when their friends sincerely try to shore them up, encouraging them to look at their positive attributes, they know that something is just not right. Some know that they choke in social situations whenever the topic becomes too uncomfortable to talk about. Others tell me that they just can\u2019t think of what to say in the moment to keep the conversation going and begin to feel awkward in trying to continue. But many are just confused, not understanding why others see them as they do. Frustrated and discouraged, they desperately want to know what they can do to solve their socially painful dilemma. Sometimes, of course, it is just a matter of being born with a socially desirable personality, but many of the behaviors that make people popular can actually be learned. I firmly believe that people who have not been able to hold their audiences can learn how to both bring people closer and keep from pushing them away. The first step in learning any new way of being is to courageously look at what has not worked in the past. Exploring past social faux pas is hard for anyone and will only help if any negative self-judgments are put aside in the process. Prior social mistakes leave painful scars for everyone, but, if they are seen as learning experiences, they can be the foundation of what to leave behind and to activate the motivation to learn what does work. There are basic personality characteristics and specific behaviors that can either turn people away or make them want to come closer. The first category is actually easier. Most people can readily learn what they might be doing that either bores or alienates others. The second, acquiring the personality characteristics and behaviors that attract, takes more practice, but once achieved, is extraordinarily rewarding. Common Personality Characteristics That Turn People Off: 1) Insecurity Insecurity usually manifests as a strong need for approval. Insecure people try too hard and often respond too quickly to an interaction. They rapidly agree, sometimes when they inwardly disagree, and put others on a pedestal. 2) Low Energy Passive, non-reactive people tend to come across as uninterested and bored. Though they may feel quite differently inside, their demeanor signals a desire for minimal engagement and puts the pressure on the other person to carry the energy of the interaction. 3) Self-Centered People who take center stage in conversations do not usually hold their audiences for long unless they happen to be charismatic, notable, entertaining, or famous. Most self-centered people push their audiences away. Though they may just be nervous underneath, the people on the other end of them don\u2019t recognize or think about those inner feelings. 4) Seemingly Uninterested If a person looks or feels bored, the person talking isn\u2019t likely to continue for very long. Even if people feel uninterested, they can help the conversation get livelier. You generally can\u2019t be bored without being boring. 5) Inflammatory Biases When people use social interactions to express rigid or fixed ideas, they will most likely engender defensiveness or exclusion in those who feel differently. An opinionated orientation without openness to other views tells others that they have no other choice but to agree, defend, or bolt. 6) Sarcasm Sarcasm is the most misunderstood of all humor. Sarcastic people take a big chance of coming across as insulting if others don\u2019t see the humor or are offended by it. What may be funny or welcome challenge to one person can easily be a turn-off to another. Common Personality Characteristics That Attract Others: 1) Openness to new Ideas Everyone sees the world differently and usually enjoys sharing his or her views with an interested listener. Even if people disagree with the other\u2019s reality, they can try to better understand each other if there is no judgment or counter-argument. In a good, well-timed conversation, there is always enough time and interest for both people to share their own views and experiences, even when they might see things differently. 2) Being genuinely interested A good way to define curiosity is genuine interest in what is yet to be known. People who are in demand approach others with a genuine desire to know them. That behavior is reflected in their sincere questions, their active responses, their obvious interest in what is being shared, and the pleasure they show. 3) Energy Passion for life can be expressed in many ways, but energy tells the tale. It is the opposite of a lackluster, dull response. Most everyone enjoys listening to someone who is excited to be in the conversation, active in their responses, and enthusiastic about what is going on. 4) Sense of Humor It is always important that people in personal conversations know when it\u2019s appropriate to laugh and when to take things seriously. Conversations work best when both people have the capacity to participate, to lighten a situation up, and to play when it is appropriate. Those characteristics put people at ease and keep a conversation meaningful at the same time. 5) Being Present to Cues Many people are so focused on what they are thinking that they fail to pick up cues from the other that keep conversations mutually satisfying. People who pay attention to the way someone sounds, looks, feels, and acts, are more likely to notice a shift in the interaction and act accordingly. 6) Empathic People who attract others have a natural tendency to be compassionate and supportive. They feel when another is uneasy or nervous, and compensate by adjusting their tone and response style. They notice when the person talking to them rapidly changes the subject or looks uncomfortable. There is nothing to say more than what i\u2019m going to say now, the most important thing of all is, what you think of youself in your mind. If you want to achieve anything, start with achieving your own mind and make it under your own control. Be the one to express your inner mind. ",

            "answer_text": "The basic formula which I believe to become \u201cFamous\u201d are as follows - Master the ability to sell.Fix your target audience. This will go a huge way in choosing your product (literally anything -products, services, talents, emotions etc.) and platform (literally anything too, Academics, Arts, Sports etc in real life, Academics, Arts, Sports etc on social sites etc.)Based on the above two, sell your product effectively to the target audience on your preferred platform. If they like it, they would come back,then even more would get to know and like it, and sooner than later, you will be famous.Selling is everything. Every famous person has something to sell. Artists sell their Art (Actors/Singers/Dancers/Painters etc.(the order is in descending fame)) Sports Stars sell (perform) their skills. Geniuses sell their skills. (Inventing, researching etc.) Rich people sell their monetary collection and so on and so forth. Generic advice on becoming famous in the years to come - Choose you target audience properly. They are the ones who are going to make you famous. Audiences can make or break you.Ensure the strength of your audience is to your satisfaction i.e ensuring the platform is worth it and to your content. Eg:-Being the most famous player in, say Squash/Chess, does not even come close to the popularity an above average player gets in Soccer/Cricket or NFL/NBA/MLBA person having 15k followers on a platform of 100k may be relatively more famous to a person having 200k followers on a platform of a billion, but doesn\u2019t enjoy the same status the 200k person enjoys.Pewdiepie is more famous than Balaji Vishwanathan, even though BV is more talented than Pew. (no offense to BV)In short, the more their strength, the better.Behave as your audience wants you to. You won\u2019t sell effectively if the audience are Teens and your actions are presumed preachy/wise. Similarly, you won\u2019t go anywhere if you write Academic Research reports like you write a Tweet.You could piggyback the ride to your fame by several underhanded means -Challenge existing famous persons, publicly - If the person ignores you, you can continue to challenge them and insult them, creating the view that they are afraid of you, thus boosting your fame. If they accept and lose, you could sound the bugle forever staking that you are better than them and thereby, becoming famous. If they win, you can still claim you were nearly as good as them and capture the sympathies of their audience. So its Win-Win-Win situation and an easy ticket to fame.Create controversies - People love to watch controversies, even if they claim they don\u2019t. Accuse a popular person of something, lie through your teeth. If they don\u2019t respond, they are seen as defensive and hence some sympathy is created for you and your lies are believed to be true. If they do respond, well hey, their entire audience now knows you and therefore, you are famous too. No publicity is bad publicity.Fake it till you make it - You can always pretend that you know what you are doing and are good at it. Repeatedly stating that you are good will actually create an illusion among your audience that, \u201cHey, he might be right\u201d and that is another ticket to your fame.Outright steal someone else\u2019s work - Once you start climbing the ladder and are out of quality content, you can always steal a relatively unknown\u2019s work and pass it as your own. If he fights back, you could pay him some hush money from the wealth you generate or convince your audience that you were the Original and not him.You cannot NOT account for opportunity. No matter how skilled or talented, how hard you have practiced, unless you are presented with the opportunity, you won\u2019t be successful, and therefore famous. Some are showered with opportunity around every corner, mostly due to the fact that they are related to existing famous personalities or they are associated with the people who are in power of the platform. This is demonstrated by Nepotism, Unfair selection means etc. But hey again, once you are famous, who cares about how you started. Even if they do, who will fight against it. Pfft, you are set for life.Or you could rise to fame the usual way, with Talent, Practice and a little bit of luck.Thank me when you are famous :D \u2571\u2571\u250f\u256e\u2571\u2571\u2503\u2503\u2589\u2501\u256f\u2517\u2501\u256e\u2589\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2503\u2589\u256e\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2503\u2571\u2570\u2501\u2501\u2501\u256f ",

            "answer_text": "You don't become popular. Popularity is a complex matter. Being popular means being admired by many people. In order to be admired by many people you need to be similar to them yet stand out as above average in many areas the others perceive as important. So being popular is about matching perfectly with a certain environment. If you take out an extremely popular person from their natural environment to one where they are the typical fish out of the water, their status changes instantly. Let's take as example four fictional characters. (they are extremely stereotypical representations to help me pass the message) Abigail is the typical teenage movies popular girl with more beauty than brain. She attends a local high school where sports are more important than the actual studies. She is captain of the cheerleading team and she decides who is cool and who is not (she has that power). She thinks she is God and she bullies poor girls because they are fat and/or ugly. She is a drama queen and a real bitch but somehow she is the real deal. Fernando is a Mexican student, small, horrible haircut, fat, and with extra large clothes that make him look even more fat. He's shy and not at all assertive. A real loser. But he is extremely intelligent. Maybe too much: he studied 30 languages among which Middle Dutch, Old Tamil and High Valyrian, plus he created a language himself. What a weird guy, maybe he has Asperger. Who is ever going to like him? Mike is a man on his 40s, he is a carpenter, works in a very small company of 15 people. He is extremely arrogant and racist. He shares the most disturbing porn movies with his colleague and he is an incredible binge drinker. His colleagues think he is very cool and are very loyal to him. Nobody cares about him being fat and having an enormous beer belly because his very unhealthy lifestyle. In fact on his work he is very reliable and competent. Kevin is a college student. He is the prototype of the guy everyone loves. He speaks perfect Spanish, being in love with the South American cultures, he is a great soccer player, he has multiple creative talents like singing and drawing, he is incredible handsome and gains money with modelling, he has incredibly high scores and of course a lot of friends. He is always extremely kind with everyone and does even volunteering. Who is ever going to dislike him? The point is: Abigail, Mike and Kevin are at the top of their environments, and they are judged for completely different characteristics. Fernando is an outcast and he looks like a lost case, but is it over for him? What happens when these guys are moved to different environments? Abigail ends the high school and goes to the same college where Kevin is studying. Nobody is impressed by her poor attitude and slutty and bitchy behaviour. Everybody dislikes her and finds her arrogant. Abigail is now an outcast. Fernando completes his studies with the highest grades and takes a PHD in linguistics. He quickly becomes the big deal in his field due to his extreme competence and intelligence. He is now popular and enjoy having very nice conversations about his studies and his other nerd hobbies. Mike wins a holiday in a very luxury resort where he goes with his wife. The rich attendants of the resort stare at him with a puzzling look that seems to say: \"what is this uneducated rude man doing here?\". He casually starts a conversation at the caf\u00e9 with a distinct man and tells him that \u201cthe police should shoot those Mexican monkeys that enter in the USA without permission\". The man does what every educated man would do, answering nothing and leaving disgusted. Whenever Mike states similar sentences among his peers, they always laugh and agree with him. Here, it wasn't exactly the same. Kevin decides to try out powerlifting, and joins a local gym where also a colleague of Mike and some of his friends train. It turns out that the environment in that particular gym is an extremely macho one. Kevin is ridiculed to be \u2018the skinny guy that doesn't even deadlift 220 lbs', a \u2018pretty face with a vagina\u2019 and \u2018friend of the Mexican monkeys\u2019 - yes, Kevin makes the mistake to mention that he went on holidays in Spain. Kevin leaves the gym after 4 training sessions. He's not home there. \u2014 Have you ever had a \u2018popular for one day\u2019 experience? Where you meet some friends of friends that are similar to you and you immediately have a click and something you say particularly impresses the people that are present? Popularity is exactly that thing. Work on yourself, do what you like and avoid toxic environments. Be good in what you find important. However, I discourage you trying to fit in doing what the popular in that environment people do in order to be cool. In certain places even things like abusing drugs cause your popularity to rise, but is it a good thing? Is it a good thing to study the ass out of you to win a Math competition when you absolutely hate it? To be falsely nice to people you don't like because otherwise you aren't cool? So: don't worry about becoming popular. Once you work on yourself and you are in the right environment you will experience instant popularity. But if you are not in your right environment and you can't change it, being somewhat in the middle is the best place to be. ",

            "answer_text": "Why not learn form the experiences of others? I mean there are many internationally famous people, why not follow them. One person who\u2019s name I always hear on the news is Donald Trump.  This man became famous, or more accurately has become this famous because of his position as the president of the US. To follow in Trump\u2019s footsteps and become president you do have to be over 35, a born US citizen, and (though it\u2019s not official) it doesn\u2019t hurt to be a rich white man. Can\u2019t become the US president? How about dictatorship? Adolf Hitler is one of history\u2019s most famous people all he did was cause a war and ultimately kill 11 million people. Joseph Stalin is another dictator and he is remembered for causing a country to starve. He is one of the most hated people on the planet.  If \u201cleading\u201d a country isn\u2019t your style how about destroying one and leaving an imprint of your life on the world? That\u2019s what Mohamed Atta, Hani Hanjour, and many others did when they crashed planes into the twin towers on September 11th 2001. Though they did die in the chaos. And committed horrifying crimes. Which involved taking the lives of over 1000 people.  If all this death and destruction is getting you down, why not be like William Shakespeare, writing 37 plays, many of which are worshiped and respected like no other centuries later.  Be like Shakespeare and give the world of literature a gift or be like Oscar Wilde and write brilliant short stories and novels, while also impacting authors profoundly.  Or be like Marie Curie and make fascinating breakthroughs for science despite being a women and therefore very limited.  My point is that there\u2019s no one way to be famous and as a famous and world renowned person you can either do horrible, despicable things, change the world for the better or just live and be forgotten a couple hundred years later.

            "answer_text": "Do something so good people have to talk about it. Save someone\u2019s life in an amazing way. Survive a disaster in the most amazing way. Do something clever to make someone\u2019s life better. Do something so bad people have to talk about it. \u2026I\u2019m not listing ideas, but, be Hitler, King Herod, or a terrorist. I don\u2019t recommend this as a goal\u2026 Do anything extreme/strange/weird/unique that will catch attention. Make a giant steel sculpture version of an everyday object for a park. Become a one-hit-wonder with a cheesy song with sexual innuendos and unintelligible vocalization parts that gets played on various radio stations. Bike across the world through wind, rain, and snow, with a three-legged cat in your backpack. Never shave your face for the rest of your life and end up with a 6 foot. dreaded beard. Jokes aside, gaining fame is one of those things that (most) everyone wants to have but no one can ever control. It\u2019s always hit or miss. No matter what you\u2019re making, producing, becoming, what you are, what you want to do, what you\u2019ve done, what level it\u2019s done at, no matter how crazy, subtle, extreme, lightly, or any other adjective you can think of, you cannot gain and receive fame on your control. You can try to gain fame and it could work immediately, you could try to work for fame and it not happen until 6 years of steady trying, or you could try to work for fame and never get it. It\u2019s completely unpredictable. You shouldn\u2019t do something just so you\u2019ll be famous. There\u2019s no joy or really no point in it and you\u2019ll almost always lose yourself in the process. The best way to possibly gain any sort of fame is when you are doing/making/creative/being something because you love it and are passionate about it. The more passionate you are, the more heart and soul you\u2019ll put into it and the more people will notice. People love to see other people excited by their passions and this can elicit fame for some. Just like Pete Nelson, the \u201cTreehouse Man\u201d of the show Treehouse Masters:  Kim Kimble, hairstylist of top, A-list celebrities:  Or the late, great painter Bob Ross:  People don\u2019t love them because they desired to be famous. People love them because they just did what made them happy and wanted to share it with the world. People also love them because they are (or were, for the latter) genuine people and they became EXPERTS at what they do (did) not because they wanted to be recognized and famous for being an expert, but because their passion drives (drove) them to practice over and over and learn all there is to learn about their trades, and they want(ed) to share the products of their passions with others. It\u2019s ironic in nature that it seems the less one is worried about fame, the more likely one will gain it, but that is often just the way it is (and much better for your mental/emotional health in the long run!). Plus, the more you focus on your passion and what makes you happy, the less you\u2019ll probably find the idea of fame and gaining it to be so important. ",

Which is ironic because there is plenty of talent out there.)Sell your soul to the demonic forces (I don\u2019t recommend that one either)Do videos on Youtube about catsStart actingInvent a line of cosmeticsBecome a clothes designer and network with the right peopleSo as you can see, fame these days is not worth pursuing. It never was. Nicolas Tesla didn\u2019t have an easy life, despite trying to create free energy for everyone. Neither did Einstein. Usually they wait till you die to give you credit. Being a scientist or discoverer does not pay off, unless you are involved in mass genocide like the case of the Indians or Hitler. Good people are not recognized, just evil people. Maybe that\u2019s why the scriptures say Satan is ruling the world. I myself do not seek fame, for this reason. In fact, I have turned down acting roles where women were seen as fast or promiscuous. I get asked all the time to donate or recite a poem at events, for no pay! The industry loves to use people. They want all your money and donations, but are not willing to compensate you for your time. It is sick! I see now why Frankie Lymon, despite unusual talent was never compensated other than getting candy money and clothes. What a insult to his intelligence. And we hear of similar cases where artists with hit records are not compensated. It is all because of sharks out there using people\u2019s talents. So if you want to get famous, be sure you research what is out there first. ",

            "answer_text": "Are you here to learn to be famous? Cause famous is cool. Famous is fun. Famous is attractive.  but WAIT! Think for a second though. maybe we\u2019re aiming for the wrong thing? Instead of famous. Why not RICH? Why RICH is better: 1) You focus on what truly matters. Whenever you create something you\u2019re proud of, there\u2019s a natural tendency to want to tell everybody about your success. Look at me. I am so great! The more you share, the more addicted you become to the attention and the less you focus on the work that made you proud in the first place. There are people who are trapped in a cyclone of self-validation, e.g., constantly posting selfies of a new look on Twitter, showing off a new car on Facebook, or writing about yet another fabulous vacation on Instagram. Think about it. If your self-esteem is strong, why do you need to tell anybody about anything you do? 2) You become impervious to insults. After you\u2019ve been called a loser, an idiot, arrogant, out of touch, shameful, a dickhead, a chink, and many other epithets, your mind turns bulletproof. After all, when you\u2019re already a nobody, nothing can be any lower. 3) You can live your life in peace. Being famous is a curse. Yet, for some reason, kids seem to have an insatiable desire for worldwide attention. What the hell happened? Is it due to social media or bad parenting or both? When you\u2019re famous, many people want something from you, mostly your time. And given time is more valuable than money, being known robs you of your most precious asset. 4) There are no expectations of you. When you\u2019re a nobody, nobody expects you to do anything or do anything special. Therefore, you can regularly surpass expectations.  An advice I find powerful and freeing: \u201cAll this desire for fame and prestige is truly a waste of time. Get your 15 minutes of fame to satisfy your curiosity. Maybe get 30 minutes just to be sure. Soak up the thrill. Then let it go.\u201d Source ",

            "answer_text": "How to Become Famous So you've decided - you want to become famous! Fame certainly has its perks, and you'll find there are many paths to get to fame. One of the best ones is to develop a talent. Then, you can market yourself and that talent to the world, building your base and making you famous. Keep in mind that it often takes a lot of work to become and stay famous, so if you're not willing to work hard, this path may not be the one for you. Plus, even if you work your hardest, you may still not become famous, as it takes an element of luck, as well. Method One of Three:Finding a Path to Fame 1Decide how famous you want to be. Fame comes at many different levels. For instance, you could be famous in your school or workplace. You could be famous in your hometown or your state. Alternatively, you could go for ultimate fame and attempt to be famous around the world. Each of these has its own unique pros and cons, so it's up to you to decide how much fame you want.2Create a unique solution to a problem. Think about the problems in your life and in the world around you. If you can come up with a unique solution or a unique invention, you may become famous for it.[1]For example, Marie Curie became famous as a scientist and inventor of the X-ray.Think about problems in your life. Maybe you're always late, or you hate having to hunt around for your shoes everyday. What solutions could you come up with to help yourself and others with these problems?Advertisement3Stand out from other people. Sometimes, you'll get noticed for just being yourself, if you have a unique way of doing things or a unique way of looking at the world. The key is to go your own way and be just who you are. You shouldn't change how you do things just because you do them in a unique or odd way.Break away from stereotypes. If you love to skateboard, find your own unique tricks. Instead of going for a typical \"skater\" look, find your own flair.4Audition for a reality show. Another way people become famous is by going on reality shows. You don't necessarily need a talent to get on a reality show, though in some cases, you'll need one, such as with singing shows. Look on the shows' websites to find out where and when you can audition.Generally, it helps to be enthusiastic when you audition, particularly about the show.Keep in mind, on reality competition shows, the judges may be tough or mean. Don't take it too personally, though. It's a part of the show5Be generous in a unique way. While this may seem counter-intuitive, some people become famous by doing something for other people in a really unusual way. It could be making a large donation, but you could also just raise money in some way that's out of the ordinary.For instance, one man, Si Burgher had famously long eyebrows, nearly 3 inches (7.6 cm)! When friends suggested he let people shave them off to raise money for charity, he agreed and became famous in his hometown of Bloomfield, Indiana.[2]For example, you could make it your goal to bake and sell a million brownies to raise money for a cause.Advertisement6Work on a world record. Another way you might become famous is by breaking a world record. Read through the world records, and figure out if you could work on one to break.[3]Keep in mind, your world record will likely need to be verified by a Guinness Book of World Record's official. Plus, to truly get famous this way, you need to pick a record that people care about, rather than just any record.7Post a silly video. In a social media-driven world, you can win 5 minutes of fame by posting a goofy video that takes the internet by storm. It doesn't have to be anything terribly difficult. It just has to be engaging and entertaining. It can involve something as simple as your cat doing something funny.[4]You might post a video of you playing a funny song on your instrument, or doing something funny in a public place.

            "answer_text": "Decide how famous you want to be. Fame comes at many different levels. For instance, you could be famous in your school or workplace. You could be famous in your hometown or your state. Alternatively, you could go for ultimate fame and attempt to be famous around the world. Each of these has its own unique pros and cons, so it's up to you to decide how much fame you want. Create a unique solution to a problem. Think about the problems in your life and in the world around you. If you can come up with a unique solution or a unique invention, you may become famous for it. For example, Marie Curie became famous as a scientist and inventor of the X-ray.Think about problems in your life. Maybe you're always late, or you hate having to hunt around for your shoes every day. What solutions could you come up with to help yourself and others with these problems?Stand out from other people. Sometimes, you'll get noticed for just being yourself, if you have a unique way of doing things or a unique way of looking at the world. The key is to go your own way and be just who you are. You shouldn't change how you do things just because you do them in a unique or odd way. Break away from stereotypes. If you love to skateboard, find your own unique tricks. Instead of going for a typical \"skater\" look, find your own flair.Be generous in a unique way. While this may seem counter-intuitive, some people become famous by doing something for other people in a really unusual way. It could be making a large donation, but you could also just raise money in some way that's out of the ordinary. For instance, one man, Si Burgher had famously long eyebrows, nearly 3 inches (7.6 cm)! When friends suggested he let people shave them off to raise money for charity, he agreed and became famous in his hometown of Bloomfield, Indiana.[2]For example, you could make it your goal to bake and sell a million brownies to raise money for a cause.Work on a world record. Another way you might become famous is by breaking a world record. Read through the world records, and figure out if you could work on one to break. Keep in mind, your world record will likely need to be verified by a Guinness Book of World Record's official. Plus, to truly get famous this way, you need to pick a record that people care about, rather than just any record.Post a silly video. In a social media-driven world, you can win 5 minutes of fame by posting a goofy video that takes the internet by storm. It doesn't have to be anything terribly difficult. It just has to be engaging and entertaining. It can involve something as simple as your cat doing something funny. You might post a video of you playing a funny song on your instrument, or doing something funny in a public place. Get creative, and make sure you're having fun! If you're enjoying yourself, your audience is more likely to like the video!",

            "answer_text": "7 Simple Ways To Be Famous In One Year 1. Begin By Making It All About Others, Not Yourself If you are going to reach niche celebrity status, your first step is to become a truly trusted resource for others. This means that you do the following: Inspire, entertain and educate others without thought to making sales or promoting yourself or your business Be a real person behind that company, not a faceless entity Be accessible and transparent; have a social media presence that involves conversations; answer emails; be present wherever there are important conversations occurring, especially in groups related to your niche Do not be \u201cbetter\u201d than others; rather be helpful and friendly and humble Engage others daily, especially influencers. Hanging out with influencers makes you one too. If you succeed, don\u2019t be the first one to boast, but try to share the lessons you\u2019ve learn and inspire other people to follow your path. And if you don\u2019t succeed from the first attempt, don\u2019t be discreet about your failure either. There\u2019s nothing wrong with making mistakes and talking about that, rather than trying to appear as a super human. Compare this to the traditional concept of a supposed industry leader \u2013 one who gave an occasional interview; one who had \u201cgatekeepers;\u201d one who knew s/he was \u201cbetter\u201d than the others; one who was inaccessible. This won\u2019t work for you, because you don\u2019t have any fame yet. 2. Get Your Face and Your Personality \u201cOut There\u201d Brands are not really spread by products and services anymore. They are spread by personalities on social websites and news media. It\u2019s almost as if we have returned to days of old when storekeepers had personal relationships with all of their customers. Of course, these can no longer be face-to-face, but they can be strong relationships nevertheless. Today\u2019s digital consumers of anything demand relationships. If you have written a book, for example, you need to show online communities who you are, your sense of humor, your sense of compassion, your incredible expertise, whatever it is that makes you a bit of a \u201cgiant\u201d in your niche. Provide excerpts from that book for free to every digital community possible. Set up book signings everywhere possible and call the local news media to cover them. Offer an additional benefit with a book purchase. Get buzz going by pushing your face and your personality, not just your book. \u2304 Scroll down to continue reading article \u2304 Always Putting Things off Until Tomorrow?

Your Best Email Address Download Now Free \u2304 Scroll down to continue reading article \u2304 Inject your personality into everything you do online and on the ground. If you are in a business niche, hold events, make videos, and plaster them all over the place. Feature your customers in your blog posts, on your social media platforms. Do anything that you can to spread your brand by spreading the people factor, not by pushing the product or service. Come up with something that people will look forward to every week \u2013 things that will draw them to you and make them draw their communities to you too. 3. Provide Consistent, Public, Interesting, and Free Content Jack Daniels is a well-known brand. It has been a well-known brand for years. And it has done this by consistently keeping itself in front of the public. Now, in years past it relied on TV advertising \u2013 expensive advertising. Advertising that those of us who would just like to become famous in our niche cannot afford. We have to find cheap ways to become famous, and even Jack Daniels is going the cheap route now. It\u2019s not all over TV \u2013 that\u2019s a thing of the past. What does Jack Daniels do now? It has an amazing website and an amazing social media presence. It sponsors contests for people to submit new drink recipes. It asks customers to submit weird bar stories, which it publishes \u2013 consumers love it and they continue to love Jack Daniels. Jack Daniels will be famous for years to come because it understand how fame is now built. When you use the same strategies that Jack Daniels uses, you can build your fame too. Get your \u201cpublic\u201d involved in everything you do. Other than the cost of maintaining your websites and social media platforms through employees or contractors, your cost of providing amazing and interest and entertaining and inspirational content is cheap. No one wants to read what looks like a textbook; and no one want to just hear about products. They want some fun and some education and they want it in engaging ways. Even if your niche seems \u201cboring\u201d, there\u2019s still a way to interact with your audience successfully and leveraging your authority status. Simply, by offering free detailed information of every aspect related to your business. For instance, Moverscorp publishes loads of amazing guides, covering pretty much any aspect of moving \u2013 from choosing the company to packing to tipping movers and things to do after the move. You can build your fame if you are committed to giving your public the best content ever. On the Internet there are no walls and there are few rules. You build a fan base and that fan base reaches out to its communities, as long as your content is great. People share what is free and what is publicly provided. So give free and public! 4. Sponsor an Important Charity One of the best ways to enhance your fame is to sponsor a well-known and compassionate charitable cause. You can do wonderful good while you increase your fame as well. Why do people love Toms Shoes, and why has Toms Shoes become so famous? Because owner Blake Mycoskie, \u201cchief shoe giver,\u201d donates a pair of shoes to a needy child for every pair of shoes he sells. And he has branched out now into efforts for restoring eyesight and drilling water in 3rd world countries. He is a hero, especially among millennials, the biggest buying demographic, for all that he does. And he has great fame within his niche. \u2304 Scroll down to continue reading article \u2304 Get That Goal You've Always Wanted Grab a FREE Lifehack Guide to start getting what you want!

If you want to make a difference in the lives of people and gain fame as well, this is a great path. Local, regional and state media love these kinds of stories, and the reach spreads. Both Mycoskie and Erickson have been featured on national television shows several times. 5. Develop Relationships with Influencers There are famous people in related niches. Influencers are already famous within their niches. One of the \u201crules\u201d for success is to hang out with successful people. The same goes in the digital world. You can \u201cfollow\u201d influencers, participate in their discussions, and make yourself known as an expert in your niche. Cultivate these relationships before you propose any reciprocity of promotion, but ultimately you can get to that. Being respected and liked by an influencer, even if not directly related to your niche is big. And influencers can introduce you to other influencers as well. This can ultimate get you speaking engagements, interviews, and/or promotion of your book, and so forth, depending upon the type of fame you are seeking. 6. Work on Your Fame Everyday This means many things. It can be to join new groups. It can mean to contact local media with a press release. It can mean creating amazing content or videos. It can mean reaching out to new communities on social media. But you must consistently commit to doing something every day to promote your fame. If you do this for an entire year, you will be pretty amazed at how famous you have become with your ideal audience. 7. Cultivate your Guru Status At first, you will give away a lot of stuff, maybe you will create free \u201chow-to\u201d e-guides. Maybe you will create slide shows and videos that provide expert advice. As the demand for your stuff grows, create new \u201cstuff\u201d and begin to charge for it. Why? Because famous people are expected to charge for their \u201cstuff,\u201d and because you have the right to earn money for your hard work. Neil Patel, the guru of content marketing, has the perfect combination. He is the co-founder of Crazy Egg, KISSmetrics, and Hello Bar. These are for-profit companies with famous clients like Amazon, GM, NBC, etc. He also has a blog, called Quick Sprout. Here he provides free educational articles for content marketers and business owners. But always on that blog, he is promoting his fee-based services, one of which is to make a business owner a \u201cguru\u201d and famous in his/her own niche. Becoming famous in a year is simple, but not necessarily easy. It takes concerted effort and a commitment that must be held every single day of that year. It means spending two hours working on that book; or it means an hour contacting local press to promote a charitable event; or it means writing the best content ever; or it mean networking and \u201crubbing elbows\u201d with influencers. It can be tiring and it can mean that your workday just got longer. You have to ask yourself, before you take on this \u201cfame\u201d goal: why you want to become famous and what it will mean for you? If you can answer these questions positively, then you are ready for the journey. Make the Change You've Always Wanted Now!

Read full profile Share Pin it Tweet Share Email Highly confident people believe in their ability to achieve. If you don\u2019t believe in yourself, why should anyone else put their faith in you? To walk with swagger and improve your self-confidence, watch out for these fifteen things highly confident people don\u2019t do. And if you want to know the difference between an arrogant person and a confident person, watch this video first: 1. They don\u2019t make excuses. Highly confident people take ownership of their thoughts and actions. They don\u2019t blame the traffic for being tardy at work; they were late. They don\u2019t excuse their short-comings with excuses like \u201cI don\u2019t have the time\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m just not good enough\u201d; they make the time and they keep on improving until they are good enough. 2. They don\u2019t avoid doing the scary thing. Highly confident people don\u2019t let fear dominate their lives. They know that the things they are afraid of doing are often the very same things that they need to do in order to evolve into the person they are meant to be. 3. They don\u2019t live in a bubble of comfort. Highly confident people avoid the comfort zone, because they know this is a place where dreams die. They actively pursue a feeling of discomfort, because they know stretching themselves is mandatory for their success. 4. They don\u2019t put things off until next week. Highly confident people know that a good plan executed today is better than a great plan executed someday. They don\u2019t wait for the \u201cright time\u201d or the \u201cright circumstances\u201d, because they know these reactions are based on a fear of change. They take action here, now, today \u2013 because that\u2019s where progress happens. \u2304 Scroll down to continue reading article \u2304 Always Putting Things off Until Tomorrow?

They don\u2019t obsess over the opinions of others. Highly confident people don\u2019t get caught up in negative feedback. While they do care about the well-being of others and aim to make a positive impact in the world, they don\u2019t get caught up in negative opinions that they can\u2019t do anything about. They know that their true friends will accept them as they are, and they don\u2019t concern themselves with the rest. 6. They don\u2019t judge people. Highly confident people have no tolerance for unnecessary, self-inflicted drama. They don\u2019t feel the need to insult friends behind their backs, participate in gossip about fellow co-workers or lash out at folks with different opinions. They are so comfortable in who they are that they feel no need to look down on other people. 7. They don\u2019t let lack of resources stop them. Highly confident people can make use of whatever resources they have, no matter how big or small. They know that all things are possible with creativity and a refusal to quit. They don\u2019t agonize over setbacks, but rather focus on finding a solution. 8. They don\u2019t make comparisons. Highly confident people know that they are not competing with any other person. They compete with no other individual except the person they were yesterday. They know that every person is living a story so unique that drawing comparisons would be an absurd and simplistic exercise in futility. ",

            "answer_text": "Why do you pursue to become popular? You can't actually become popular if you are doing everything just to become popular. Just be the way you are. You don't have to change yourself or necessarily look cool to be popular. Otherwise You won't be able to enjoy any part of your life, because you will be busy busy in impressing others just to become popular! Well, be confident, have faith in yourself, you can join groups which can make you more knowledgeable and productive, pursue your interests and hobbies ( like to learn several languages or playing some games or anything). Try to be more creative or different from others, help others which will surely make you more respectful. And be the way you are, and never give up in even the worst situation. Everyone likes your original personality. If you will change yourself you won't be able to neither become popular nor to enjoy this wonderful life.Let me tell about  Arunima Sinha and Emily Blunt.Before Blunt became popular for acting on the stage and big screen, she could barely carry a conversation with her classmates: Between ages seven and 14, Emily had a major stutter. As she told magazine, \"I was a smart kid, and had a lot to say, but I just couldn't say it. It would just haunt me. I never thought I'd be able to sit and talk to someone like I'm talking to you right now.\"But that all changed when one of her junior high teachers encouraged her to try out for the school play\u2014a totally unappealing feat given the fact that she had such a hard time communicating.    Arunima  Sinha Arunima Sinha lost her leg when some robbers pushed her out of a moving train. Two years later, she became the first woman amputee to climbMount Everest . She disliked the look of pity and sympathy in everyone\u2019s eyes and did not want to be looked upon as a handicapped person. She has proved that a strong determination is far more important than a strong body. So, dear you should never give up and have to be confident enough to shake the whole world. ",

            "answer_text": "The reader will be surprised to see the conclusion. That it is differing from actual question and answer. But first let\u2019s look for the general answer.  To be popular or appraised on Quora is not an easy task. It is hard-work, whole hearten work and finally a game, in a sense. And so is its unpredictability. In this platform, the failures may be quite sure and predictable but successes are rarely predictable. Still below are the prescribed tips, which I gathered through experience only: Select popular topics: Topics on nuclear and biochemistry may require more expertise but there are less readers to take interest and to understand and appreciate. A popular topic like tricks for banking , ticket booking, shopping, reservations require less expertise and there are millions interested who can appreciate. Further, it is better to stick to public topics, i.e. topics where masses are impacted directly and masses always find interest in them which may not be directly profitable to them. For example topics related to Brexit, American election, Demonetization in India. Remember that topics should be easily understandable and not highly technical like Mars Mission. There are only few takers on technical subjects like biotechnology, nuclear, microeconomics etc.Select popular questions: Answering directly to the 'requests' or top questions for you brings less views than answering on topics having more followers.Timing your answers: Answering too early or too late on current affair topics is worst. For example now is certainly not time to write on Brexit but may be little good time to write on Trump, the president-elect. If you are write very late...even the followers of questions do not take interest to read the answers as the are already saturated with lot of answers; the wave has lost the amplitude. Again writing too early is also not suggested. At very beginning their are very less followers to questions and less observers to the answers. Further, other writers, learning from the initial answers, gain knowledge, data, experience, manipulate and add their own and write further better answers.Complexity of hundreds of answers: If a question has many answers, like this one, then nobody is going to read all the answers. So your answers, when just written should be on upper side, best if on top. If the fresh answer slides below in the crowd of answer there is hardly any reader other than the writer's own followers. It can be avoided by points mentioned in line.Improving the presentation of answers: Answers with pictures or images are more attractive. Very short answers are mostly collapsed. Mostly answer should be explained at length. Very short, simple and straight answers are suitable for Quora-Messages and other social media platforms, not on Quora-Answers.Finally it is the quality of answers: If answers are really very good, all tricks, timings and follower base become secondary and answer views rises. If answer is selected to be on Quora digest, there is an exponential growth...however for one week only. Sometime even text only answers carry more views than picture inserted answers to the same question. Writes too have to be patient. As happens with me and almost all of us, few answers written loosely catches more views and few answers written carefully, with lot of research and expertise, with labor of about and hour, catches less views. Here there is less to do with writer's labor knowledge or expertise. But there is more to do with the popularity of question itself.An ironical example:  Indians love the legacy of former president Dr. Abdul Kalam. We used to like his story and vision on facebook/Quora written by even a random writer. Now imagine that Dr. Kalam is himself Quora user. Of course, his followers base will run to hundreds of thousands if not millions. Now further imagine that he himself writing his expert articles on cryogenic engine technology, propulsion engineering etc. How many of us will be able to understand and appreciate his sound technical answers. Except the technical field readers, the common users will slowly loose interest in his articles. The conclusion is something different. Yes, more views and upvotes makes writer feel better psychologically as well judge the quality of answer. But the writer should feel happy of his own work. This does not come to writers initially with high enthusiasm. This comes after a little maturity and understanding that more popularity is not necessarily an achievement. The natural enjoyment of writing or answering give far more happiness and peace of mind than the instability of mind due to hunger of views. Upvote to appreciate. Follow to get more on related topics. ",

            "answer_text": "It is hard to answer this question. Not because it's imperative in Nature, but because it's relativity. Whatever that I do publicly, will get some or the other amount of attention. I write an answer, I shout a cab, I dance, I walk, I talk, I die etc.  Why is it so? Well, this is how we human beings live. We notice. It doesn't matter then, if we record what we have noticed or not. Observation is over daily bread and butter for brain. Without the capacity to observe, the primates will be racing and may be winning against us. So if you ask me, what is that I do to be noticed? The answer would now be, NOTHING. Yup, nothing ! I don't do much. I just notice others, observe others. Others do the same thing and would recreate the same actions sometimes or the others for sure, so WALLAH !! You are already Popular. There one very small difference between, Popular and Famous. The more the popular you become, the more people would try to recreate the actions you do in their own way. Bill Gates, might have inspired trillions of people to think in a way that he did, does or will do. So, Bill is Famous. This answer will inspire only few of the readers, very few, and from them very very few would take some actions based on these inspirations from the answer, so I am just popular, not famous. Anyway, What I do to become Famous? I write. I write expecting people will be benefited, getting inspiration and getting value. Thanks for Asking. Take care ! ",

Find your talent/skill/path carve out your niche, make your self known and offer your views to local & niche specific media (remembering to provide something that benefits the overworked or lazy journalist & their audience), then leverage this into national and international press. (Good section in 4hr Work Week about this).  Or do you want celebrity status for doing nothing really truly notable? This is possible, you just need to be very good at making your audience think \"at least I'm not as stupid/dense/obnoxious/etc. as this person is, my life sprawled on the sofa reading Hello Magazine/watching TV in my pants eating cheese puffs isn't as bad as making a total fool of myself like they are\". Infamy is available by doing the stupidest (think Darwin Awards) or the worst (think electric chair/life in prison) thing you can think of with a Go Pro camera strapped to you and remembering to put optimise the title and tags well when you upload to YouTube (or making sure this is stipulated in your will).

            "answer_text": "Fame relies on a lot of people knowing about things you do. The fastest way to become famous is through aggressive criminal activity. Timothy McVeigh became famous overnight. The most recognizable people in the world are Charles Manson and Ted Bundy. Historically Jesse James, Billy the Kid, John Dillinger, Bonnie & Clyde have been the subjects of books and films, even hit songs. If fame is all you want crime is your best bet. Artists of various sorts become famous too but it\u2019s a crap shoot whether your act, whatever it is, will garner sufficient interest to reach the level of fame. The military is no longer a conduit to fame as it was a hundred years ago. Making a lot of money especially in an innovative way seems to be the modern route to fame but it\u2019s time consuming and also a crap shoot. From what I can see today, a mass shooting is your fastest route to fame in your own right. Do not however, as most of them do in midst of the mayhem, kill yourself, because if you do you will not be able to enjoy the media circus trial and the quips about you from news analysts, comedians and politicians.

            "answer_text": "I do promise you, if you do the following you will surely become famous throughout the world within a Day: Jump from the top of Burj Khalifa without any harness/safety belt.Climb Mount Everest without Oxygen Cylinder within a Day.Commit the most heinous crime any human can ever commit.Tackle the most vicious wild animal with bare hands and survive.Produce a radioactive virus, that can bring human race on the verge of extinction.etc. You might be thinking my thoughts are too dark.But on the positive side, being famous by a positive way is hard, and takes time, can also take years of hard work, Here is a step by step guide to become famous in a positive manner. Choose your goal and why you want to achieve it. - If your goal is to only be famous, and there\u2019s no reason behind it, your goal is hollow and there is a 99.99% chance that you might not become famous ( 0.001% you may by luck), once you find that \u201cwhy?\u201d factor, it can be anything that impacts your life Poverty, something you want to achieve or get past it, Status, Power, Respect, Guilt, etc, it should be strong enough to drive you 24x7 to work non stop, aggression to some extent is required. Being famous doesn\u2019t just mean that you\u2019re famous, you also have to find a purposeFind/ Develop a talent. You might be having a talent, or you need to find it, or in rare cases like mine, you have no talent, just a road full of hard work. In case you have no talent, then develop a talent, if you can\u2019t develop a talent, work as hard as people won\u2019t be able to define \u201chard\u201d. To find your talent you must try everything.\u201cNever give up!\u201d, means never!!!! , Even when you\u2019re 55 year old and still working on your goal, never give up. It depends upon you whether you or your problems will give up. Everybody has problems, everybody has bad days, everybody faces disappointments, but the people who are successfully famous never give up and brush off the failure of the past and start everything over, even when it requires their everything.Forget about the competition focus on yourself, once you forget about the competition and work upon yourself as if no one can defeat you, you can achieve the impossibleTake example of some of people who put in hard work and developed talent.Tom Cruise, you might haven\u2019t seen this video -  he might not seem ambitious and you might think that he became famous just by his good looks, but you might be wrong, just think for a second as to how many young boys at his age were better looking than him, how many would be having better acting skills at that time, because he suffered from a problem where he couldn\u2019t recite properly, the amount of effort is appreciable. The next person is someone I don\u2019t really like but he is a great example of becoming famous from scratch, the gaming youtuber turned boxer, turned pornstar, turned musician, turned actor is a great example  he put in more effort, experimented and kept going for about 7 years, although he enjoyed the journey a lot, but none can achieve that much without hard work. 2. People who became huge just by finding their talent: Martin Garrix, other musicians, Lance Armstrong, etc. 3. People who struggled and achieved everything only on basis of hard work. Daft Punk, Linkin Park, etc. You can get more examples than you need, but you need to find out, choose decide and work upon something yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "Interestingly, you need to shift focus from self to OTHERS, if you want to make a name for yourself. Following is my story. I am a Visual Communication Designer, from National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad (1979 batch). I have been a National Scholar in design. But mostly I was always thinking of self and how to make more money for myself etc. As a result in over 2 decades of practising design, I barely survived. It was a survival game. And I always wanted to make a name for myself. Over the years, I participated in several educational programs. One such program was Landmark Forum. I found it interesting and continued to complete the entire Curriculum for Living, Communication Course, Introduction Leader's Program and also participated in over 12 specialized programs offered by Landmark Education. I also volunteered my time as a coach in several of their programs. And one thing I understood in all that was, if I want to make a name for myself, I must shift my focus from self to people in my life. I must enlarge my community that I am serving. The bigger the community I serve, the more name I will make for myself. So I searched within myself; found out my passion in life. I realized that Numerology is my passion. I wouldn't mind being woken up even in the middle of night and asked for numerology consultation. And once I was present to this, I simply handed over the design business to my son and now fully concentrate in Numerology consultations and teaching.  The purpose I defined for myself is to use my creativity and persistence for guiding people achieve their goals and dreams and experience abundance, Peace, Joy, Happiness, Harmony, Health, Wealth and Wisdom in their life. And now in last four years, I have over 43000 fan following in FB, excellent reviews on Google and surpassed over 10,000 clients.  I think, I have been able to make a name for myself.  So to summarize: 1. Find your passion.2. Figure out how you could use your passion to solve other people's problems3. Focus on solving other peoples problems; the money and name will follow automatically. I hope you will find this learning useful in your life. RegardsGovind Valmikki Shandilya9900063216 ",

Can you imagine being somewhere and there's a piano and you nonchalantly strut over and stay standing and start a little one-handed Pit-Bull (TOTO but that's MOOT) rendition of \u201cAfrica\u201d. People love someone with an interesting hobby or talent. Give it all ya got. I made 2 pillowcases out of 2 napkins(for little airline pillows) at an outdoor party at our house. I used embroidery thread. Easy & fast. It looked awful. Then I turned them right-side-out and all these girls flocked to me. Like I'd just painted the Cistine Chapel. Being cool is a clean, tidy body and home.Its saying no to booze at parties. Then you can drive the pretty girls home. I'm not saying don't speak\u2026you'll know when it's time to INTERJECT something you are have knowledge of. If you're blabbering it's not attractive. If you're a teenager you are going to change so much you'll be amazed. My daughter and I used to snicker at her brother always wanting us to feel his muscle and one day we looked at each other because he WAS strong\u2026we hadn't noticed. Handsome fella. Be as smart and do your homework as you should. Half the people who are great in high school suck in the real world. Because you should spend high school getting your \u201cspecial purpose.\u201d I'm teasing you. Watch \u201cThe Jerk\u201d with Steve Martin. It's great. Watch, \u201cWhat About Bob?\u201d Watch all the Hangover movies. People are allowed to be characters. If you're so afraid to talk or even be around people that is something you should talk to your parents and Guidance Counselor about. There is help. Ask. Just like you did with a Quora kook. See?You're smart. ",

            "answer_text": "What is it with everyone wanting to be famous these days? Obviously it isn\u2019t too hard because there are hundreds if not thousands of famous people who have really done nothing to deserve their fame. The Kardashians are one example because several are famous because they are rich and have the right connections but don\u2019t deserve their fame. Paris Hilton is another. Then you have my favorite why are they famous group, Reality stars, what a joke all it takes is for you to be somewhat of a slut and get pregnant and you too can land a spot on Teen Mom. Tv is full of reality stars that then think of themselves as stars and famous and have done nothing of note to achieve fame. Not sure if that answers your question but it may give you some ideas. ",

Kailash Satyarthi formed Bachpan bachao Andolan and till now has free more than 80000 Children from slavery and child labour.He raided numerous places to free children from slavery. Intially he did that alone and was beaten up many times but never gave up. \u201cMany body parts were broken in my life time\u201d He said in an interview.He is the face of Global March Against Child Labour \u2013 a large group of as many as 2000 social-purpose organizations and unions active in 140 countries.He won Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.He\u2019s famous too.The deeds that made Pablo Escobar famous have ruined the lives of many children and youngsters.The deeds that made Kailash Satyarthi famous have saved the lives of many children.Life always offers two ways to become famous.The way of good and the way of evil.Becoming famous isn\u2019t everything but finding a place in people\u2019s heart is something.It\u2019s your choice. Be wise when you make it.Sincerely,Akash Thomas ,an imperfect teenager",

            "answer_text": "I am making two assumptions here. Famous meaning you want to be known about something by many people that too in a positive senseWhen you say public, I am assuming that public life i.e., social life beyond family, relatives, and immediate friends.Here are some ways to become famous. Work for a cause that affects many people. I hardly knew about Arvind Kejriwal before India against corruption movement. He, along with Anna Hajare, fought for bringing the Lokpal. Arvind Kejriwal was famous overnight. Be good at most followed art or sport. Lata Mangeshkar, Sachin Tendulkar are some of the famous personalities in music and sports, respectively. They were good at whatever they were doing. Many people in India enjoy music and Cricket. Do you know the best Kabbadi player in India? Probably not because masses do not follow Kabbadi. Be the first We all know about Neil Armstrong. Do we know about the second person who kept his foot on the moon? We also learn about India\u2019s first individual Olympic gold medallist Abhinav Bindra. Do something consistently which improves the lives of many. TATAs are famous for their philanthropy and quality products over the years. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is renowned for his dedication to politics and public service for the last 50 years or so. Innovate something which impacts many lives Google search engine is a classic example of a product that is used by almost everyone in the world, owing to which everyone knows about Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Bill Gates is famous for being the founder of Microsoft Corporation. There are many like Thomas Edison, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, and others. In the end, I would like to emphasize that it takes years of hard work to create or do something which affects many lives. If you do that, you are already famous. I wish you all the best for your journey to become famous. ",

            "answer_text": "I honestly would say I would do anything for the ability to have the skills I want to be famous. It really matters to me what I would be famous for as the fact that it is not always good fame. Take being famous as a thief compared to being famous as a superbowl football player. It can be a curse if you cannot control the opposition against you. The way to win a war is to control both sides to the brink of defeat on both. I learned this from emperor palpatine in star wars that even the mightiest armies will fall. The jedi never really knew who was leading from the shadows the whole time or the fact that he had the force. Same goes for count dooku who I do not understand for his blind loyalty. Even the best of servants have a little disbelief or disagreement with their masters. But back to being famous if I could be famous I would say yes if I could pick what it was for as well as how. If not then you can keep your fame cuz i would rather not be famous for a mugshot. I want to be famous for my dream. ",

            "answer_text": "I think I am able to answer this question. So becoming famous is dream of many. Now imagine that you become famous overnight and when you wake up tomorrow, people would like to take a photo with you and if you use any social media platform, you will get a rain of followers. Sounds interesting. But this happens very less time and for a very short period. For real fame and permanent fame like Ajey Nagar (CarryMinati) or Amitabh Bachchan a person has to do struggle (It should be real struggle and not like Ananya Pandey \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02).   Ok, jokes apart I have metion some ways one can become famous :- YouTube - It is a social platform in which one can post anything. There can be many genre like comedy. CarryMinati and Ashish Chanchalani. You can make education videos like Dhruv Rathee.  2. Twitter - On Twitter you write about your opinion or you can reply someone but mostly people troll someone. Almost every politician and celbrity are on twitter.  3. Instagram and Facebook - These platforms are for just small videos or photos. You can become an social influencer. If you play sports you may put your sports video.  4. Quora - Now it may be surprise for some people. But if you have knowledge about any thing, you like to write or if you have collection of memes or facts you may become famous.  (Source - Google and YouTube) . Some part of this answer has been taken from my other answer - Onir Monga's share of Onir Monga's answer to How can I get fame in India? in Famous and Financial Tips . Thanks for reading my answer.\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a Hope you guys liked my answer.\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00 . Onir Monga ",

            "answer_text": "There's a very simple complicated formula to be famous in real life ,according to me people who are popular amongst friends,family and relatives are of the following kind: 1.Be different from the crowd don't be oversweet to somebody that they consider you as a fly and blow you off neither be over rude that they stop talking to you and start ignoring you. Be humble but at the same time if something's wrong have the guts to say it straight on their face. 2. Socialise,you will have to take a step forward to mingle in the group .Help others .Being practical everyone expects in return but incase you don't get it then I won't say you should still go on or you should completely back off ,I would say you should set your limits like to what extent you can help. 3.Each person has his/her persona,Each human has his/her own swag just be proud of it don't be a braggart ,have an opinion. 4.Have self respect but don't mislead it with ego . 5. Be good human being from heart don't think Ill for others and guess what magic will happen people will start loving you,trusting you and your words. And you will be famous. ",

Wasn\u2019t the best experience haha\u2026 I tried wearing the coolest brands of over-priced clothes that weren\u2019t even that stylish, and I tried to have the same hobbies/interests as the cool kids. I watched TV shows and listened to music that I really didn\u2019t like. I can only speak for myself, but I wanted to popular because I wanted to feel liked and wanted. I wanted people to know who I was and I wanted the feeling of being someone important in school. I wasn\u2019t too confident in who I was during those times (Still working on it now haha). Once I realized that chasing popularity wasn\u2019t what I truly wanted, then I focused my attention on creating long lasting friendships with 4\u20135 people and worked on the hobbies and interests that I actually enjoyed. The more I became confident in myself, the less I wanted to be popular. It\u2019s really about who you are as a person and how you see yourself, not how others see you. The movie \u201cEighth Grade\u201d directed by Bo Burnham was a really great film that I recommend watching about this topic. I\u2019m sorry if if this wasn\u2019t the answer you were expecting, but I hope this gives you a different perspective :p ",

            "answer_text": "As far as I can tell, there are two main ways to become famous in the entertainment industry. One of them is luck; not much to be said about this one as there\u2019s very little one can do to influence it, apart from being ready to seize opportunities when they come (in your case, for example, you wouldn\u2019t want to be taking a vacation from voice warm-ups or guitar practice and then be asked to perform the next day). Which leads me to the second way: practice and hard work. You have to be good to have any chance of being noticed, and to achieve that you have to work harder than you probably think you can. There\u2019s a quote by J. M. Barrie that\u2019s really helped me put that into perspective: \u201cYou can have anything in life if you will sacrifice everything else for it\u201d. Find out what your priorities are. Finally, remember that fame does not usually happen overnight; most people who make it have worked very hard for many years. It\u2019s not easy by any stretch of the imagination. This is something you have to know going in. ",

If you\u2019re really really really good looking that will help your cause immeasurably. In fact being really really really attractive means you can become famous and not even be paticularly good at any of the aforementioned skills. If none of those are an option you could try pandering to a political fringe like Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh. You don't even have to have any clue what you are talking about. Just find a media format and pander to the audience. Just say what they want to hear and insult anyone who disagrees with them. You don't even have to mean it. Another similar option is you could start a mega church. That's a really good way to become rich and famous and you don't even have to practice what you preach. If you are absolutely desperate to become famous and none of the previous options seem plausible you could commit a horrible atrocity as well. I am not advising you to do that but it will make you famous. If you just want a quick 15 minutes of fame you could record video of your self doing something really stupid and post it to the internet. If it is dangerous enough or you get really really hurt you will get a lot of views. You could even end up on a TV show like Tosh.O. ",

If the crowd reacts well at the moment you are caught up in the screen, the cameraman will definitely turn towards you again. Wear a good smile and show a pretty gesture then. So good that Zakir Khan fans lose their control and go crazy after you. Enjoy the fame you'll receive overnight.  While Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) were battling it out yesterday on the pitch, a mystery RCB fan stole the show from the stands.  The girl's name is Deepika Ghose and she rapidly won several social media hearts just like RCB scored one of its few wins. She created an instant buzz on social media as fans started thanking the cameraman hilariously.  P.S- Your Instagram gonna flood with DM's over the night.You'll be the \u201cNational crush\u201d soon.Memers will have a happy time as they'll get a good to content to meme about.(Also TIMES OF INDIA will publish you soon in their Bollywood column.)People like me will write Quora answers on you.Your number of followers will soon convert through 3 digit to 4 digit and soon 5 digit numbers.And yeah, you need to be a girl for that.

You can be famous for jumping off the top of the Empire State Building if you just want to achieve fame or you can be a serial killer. If you want to achieve fame for a legitimate purpose, work on a skill and concentrate on THAT instead of simply achieving fame. That seems to be a superfluous goal. I don\u2019t mean to be critical of you, but I want to encourage you to focus on something constructive, of which you can actually be proud. I have to admit that this question makes me shake my head because I have worked with many \u201cfamous\u201d people in entertainment and all of them have worked very hard to be good at what they do and fame is not always what it is cracked up to be.

            "answer_text": "1. Put yourself first Whatever life you want to succeed in, you need to learn to take care of yourself. If you can't put yourself first, you won't find balance in life. In this case, the famous actress Emma Thompson says to look at her physical and mental health. Then come the people closest to you, that is, family and close people. Keep up to date with the daily news of their lives. \"Although it may be difficult to do this at Rose, try.\" Then start your own work. 2. Don't stop moving forward Edith Edge, a psychologist returning from the Auschwitz concentration camp in Germany during World War II, has always considered himself a mountaineer. \"When a mountaineer starts climbing, he slips, goes down two or three steps. But he doesn't stop climbing. I slip like that, but I don't stop climbing, I never stop. \" Edith's parents were executed at the Auschwitz concentration camp, she survived. He later moved to the United States to study psychology. \"People will be able to kill me, torture me. But no one will be able to finish my soul and the consciousness of moving forward.\" 3. No need to think about what others are thinking Famous comedian and author Joe Brand say you don't need others to care about you. Because you can believe what you think about yourself without the approval of others. \"I don't care what others think of me. I like my own look, but a lot of other people don't seem to like it.\" \"I've learned to believe, it's not always important how I look.\" \"It's not a big deal for my friends or those who love me. I think it's important to remember.\" 4. Change perspectives Many times at some bad moment we think we are buried, or we have drowned. But that can be thought of differently, as we can think of something new being sown. Actress Kelsey O'Keefe says, \"I firmly believe that you have to decide how you feel about your life or your decision. We need to make it a habit to look positively. \" \"Drowning or sowing seeds --- both are happening under the ground or underwater. But in two cases it means two things, one of them expresses a very negative attitude. The other is a positive attitude, which impresses your thinking process. \" \"There are many moments in my life when I feel like I'm dead, but in those moments I start all over again.\" 5. Stay around positive people Mary Portas, a marketing guru, says that if there are always positive people around her, she should not question her abilities or be hesitant about her failures. \"In my agency, we hire people who are around to spread the light, not those who drown others in humiliation.\" \"We like people who are always positive in all situations, agree to do everything, and give their best to get it,\" he says. \"Those who are full of energy themselves can inspire others. If you want to improve, stay away from those who are depressed or arrogant.\" . Shake your head \"Use your intelligence in any situation,\" said Edith Edge, a psychologist returning from the Oswego concentration camp. \u201cMy mother used to say we don\u2019t know where to go, we don\u2019t know what will happen in our lives. But just as others do not know what is inside our heads, no one can snatch it. \" \"I came to America empty-handed, didn't know English. But look, I graduated with honors from a well-known university in this country. I tell everyone, the greatest strength of a man is his ability to shake his head.\" . Give yourself occasional leave US author Michelle Lori says that it is not possible for a person to be successful in the same way all the time. And if you can't succeed, there is nothing to get confused about. \"We are taught all the time we have to be able to do everything. We have to be creative all the time. But we also need time to rest and think anew. \" \"A person needs time to fill his inner void, as well as leisure to evaluate his own work.\" It could be five minutes at the end of the day, think about what you did throughout the day, how you did it, how you could do it better. Excluding phone calls at this time, just give yourself some time without watching TV. . Failure is not the end of life If you fail at something, don't think your life is over. Rather think it\u2019s a \u2018comma\u2019 in your life meaning a short break, not a \u2018full stop\u2019 or end. Film personality Lily Collins says, \"I always tell myself, something 'negative' means 'no', but it's 'not now'.\" There will be no tomorrow that is not or is not likely to happen now or in the present, it does not make sense.

To me, being popular means: Being pretty, having the latest luxury brands, having many friends, being able to hang out after school etc. I tried hard to fit in with the popular crowd, faked that I liked the things that they usually do, and kept hanging out after school. After all these, I still wasn\u2019t \u2018popular\u2019. I realized that I had absolutely no potential to be \u2018popular\u2019. So, I just continued with my past so-called geeky ways( such as reading books on the bus/ studying hard). Believe it or not, I became much more known when I was smarter( at least in Math). You can actually be popular when you least expect it. I also realized that it doesn\u2019t matter whether you are popular or not. What matters is if you have the true friends who will stick by you when times are tough. I realized many things. ",

            "answer_text": "Being popular is overrated. The world is filled to its brim with attention seeking people who desire nothing more than to be rich, famous & popular. They go to great lengths in this bizarre pursuit of being well known, well liked & well paid. Popularity is not something you can simply create. It comes from something inside of you, whether it's a true talent or artistic expression. In these times it can also come from doing dangerous & downright stupid things in order to garner attention & \u201clikes.\u201d My best advice for anyone wanting to be popular is to try & be 100% genuine YOU & if people like you, great! If people don't, so what? Unless you have serious personality flaws or habits that disturb or annoy people, you'll be as popular as you can by just being the best & most authentic you. ",

Distinguish the kind of fame your seeking, then ask yourself if you\u2019re ready for the moment? with that fame comes a responsibility, are you ready for that? Now you\u2019re on a pedestal in the spotlight, with several looking up to you, will you be the one to let them down?

No one cares when you get to college or in the real world. You will meet new people and being \u201cpopular\u201dwill be a thing of the past. Popularity can bring it's own downfalls: jealousy from others lack of compassion for others, having a hard time adjusting to new situations where highschool popularity doesn't matter anymore. No one cares when you move beyond highschool. College or the real world will bring a whole new set of people and opportunities. Do you think people actually ask you if you were popular in highschool? Doesn't usually happen. In the meantime develop your own skills and hobbies: music, sports, anything that makes you, you. No one can be you. A special skill sets you apart from others and other people want to be a part of that. That is why popularity exists; because people want to hang around the people they admire..for whatever reason. Become a musician, an artist, get on a team. Be good at whatever you choose and the rest will follow. ",

If you have something that you love to do and do it for the joy, satisfaction or fun then make other people will see something in you. What is it that you want? Money? A great seat at a restaurant? To have people point at you when you walk into a room? Be yourself. Maybe you are famous and don't know it yet. ",

Really listen to friends and family and those around you. Ask them how they\u2019re doing. Don\u2019t make it about you, but actually want to be a better human being. People are drawn to beautiful people. This will make you a more liked person and this will want people to be around you. Be authentic. Tell people you care about them. Ask people in your world how they\u2019re doing. Really ask and really care to listen and ask follow up questions. Ask them how they feel and ask them why? This is how we show up powerfully. If you start showing up like this you will see life gets richer and more meaningful and those around you will start reacting and wanting to emulate those same qualities. They will be drawn to your aura and the love you are spreading. Nothing attracts more powerfully then love. Be a loving human being. And when we emanate love the world can see and we begin to shine our light and people are drawn to us. ",

What people LIKE is people who like and are really interested in THEM. A person who is really interested in ME is almost irresistible to me. How can you not like someone who already likes you? The way you can do this is to wonder what other people\u2019s lives are like - what do they read, what do they do with their time, what are their families like, their children if any. How about pets - that\u2019s always a good way to meet strangers. In other words, though this may sound strange - the way to BE popular is to make someone else popular to yourself; thinking about them, wondering about them, talking to them, finding out about them, helping them with something, appreciating them, complimenting them. Don\u2019t worry - you\u2019ll get it all back in terms of friendship and that\u2019s what you\u2019re after, isn\u2019t it? ",

Even if you're born into fame, you are constantly having expectations because of the famous people you have connections with. Fame won't come from doing something you don't like either. Do something that YOU love. Not what people want you to love. Fame is a hard thing to earn. And even harder thing to maintain. But if you work hard enough ..anyone can be famous. ",

Some people can't handle fame and fortune, Howard Hughes was a classic example of that. His fame and fortune caused him to become a recluse. Also, some people start acting like a despot. They start thinking rules and laws don't apply to them anymore. These are some of the curses of having unearned societal accolades. Movie stars, singers, and athletes are typically the people most revered this way. But for the most part they are normal people outside of their talents. That's why giving them an elevated status can sometimes destroy them psychologically. On stage and in the stadium they're king or queen. But beyond that, the other accolades of life should be earned. To their credit, some fight feverishly to have a sense of privacy and to maintain their dignity as a person. ",

Brad Pitt stands out because of his blessed genes, so making yourself famous can come naturally to you or you can work hard and get recognised for it. Malala yousufzai is famous because of her bravery and courage, she did what many of the adults were afraid to do, stand up to the bullies, bullies with guns. BUT don't get SHOT that was just an example how people with different backgrounds are famous because of what they did. A tiny bit or should I say a bucketful of luck plays a role in it too, but at the end of the day it's all YouTube :p and hard work.

It sucks because you enter into every single interaction with the knowledge that there are an infinite number of variables that might come into play and require you to change \u201cwho you are\u201d on the fly. This creates a fear of what you will say, how you will be perceived, etc. I am going to keep this short and let you figure out which option works better and leads to happiness. :) ",

I became well known because I stood up to the biggest bully in school and fought him after school. I do not recommend this path, and sometimes it is all there is to do. It was a draw but that was a major victory for me. This being well known, for meaning what I said and following through, allowed me to be a part of nearly every social group in my high school, even if I was an outsider. From the jocks, ASB, surfers and stoners I am proud to call some from each group a friend. And that is much better than being popular. At least in my book. Thanks for the ask to answer. All the best, Jami ",
