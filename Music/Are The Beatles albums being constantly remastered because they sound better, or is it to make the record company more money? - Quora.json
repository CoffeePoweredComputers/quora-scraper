            "answer_text": "I would say both are the case. Giles Martin, son of the Beatles\u2019 renowned producer, George Martin, and one of the world\u2019s top music engineers/producers in his own right, has endeavored in the last 15 years to bring the possibilities of modern sound engineering and new imagination to the Beatles\u2019 catalogue. Yet, Giles also has been studiously adherent in that process to the creative integrity and original vision that went into the recordings the Beatles and his father made. That said, Beatles songs and their commercial brand remain an extremely lucrative source of income to the label and related businesses. So, why not keep generating revenue by remastering and re-selling new versions of the recordings? After all, Paul and Ringo\u2019s grandkids need shoes. ",

Not to sound rude here to you or anyone, but - it probably is both. I enjoy the new remixes; I don\u2019t have that good an ear to hear the subtle differences sometimes. But with the Beatles, all of their stuff is highly interesting, so let them remaster it! And more is in the vaults which we\u2019d love to hear (and buy!) So it\u2019s both, and nuthin\u2019 wrong with that. No one is forced to buy it. ",

As sound tech is advanced , everything is remastered - just like film - it is inevitable & of course they want to keep improving the product & raise profits at same time!!!! ",
