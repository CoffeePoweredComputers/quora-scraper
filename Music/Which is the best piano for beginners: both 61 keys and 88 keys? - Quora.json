            "answer_text": "For a beginner: only get an 88 key keyboard. As a pianist and I have to perform on a less than 88, I end up playing wrong notes at the bass end (until I get used to it) because my peripheral vision tells me where the end of the keyboard is and it is not an A Its a minor detail, granted, but a beginner needs to train his eyes peripheral vision to memorize where the ends of the keyboard are. Also, never buy a keyboard of any kind that does not have a sustain pedal input. Without that, it is almost useless in a performing situation.  Everybody learns best in different ways but personally I was getting nowhere until I tried this course: Pianoforall | Learn Piano & Keyboard | 200 Video Lessons I like having everything laid out so I can see myself progress through it and I know what I need to be working on. As a piano, always go for 88 keys! The better 61 key units are really targeted to be MIDI controllers, where you arent really playing whole arrangements but creating sound clips to be mixed using Digital Audio Work station (DAW) software. The lesser 61 key units are out there to provide a very low cost way to get a keyboard, but typically lack the proper full weighted and touch sensitive keys and provide limited polyphony. ",

            "answer_text": "For beginners, obviously the chance is that they study soon and turns out intermediate. So better buy the one you'll love to see it forever. It's not about the features that values most. It's about the sound quality and feel that makes us keep playing it for years and never feeling cheap about it. So? In a tight budget I prefer Casio!!! Mind it, Yamaha sucks at giving you the best deal at any tight budget. You'll at first love it, but later you'll regret it. Also the sound quality, touch feel, all makes it very cheap and unprofessional later. So as if now even more than the Roland's cheap model, Casio is good for a tight budget. Casio ctk 7300 in model. The sound is best out of all, also includes best features utilisable at all ages and sessions. Even useful for a Pro. Now for a hammer graded action 88 key piano, Yamaha gives the best sound more than Casio and oh it really sounds good. I'll only suggest Yamaha and never Casio since you'll never get that professional sound. For a beginner, you the best would be P125B. The other variants have been stopped as if now. Finally it's your call as per your necessity. ",
