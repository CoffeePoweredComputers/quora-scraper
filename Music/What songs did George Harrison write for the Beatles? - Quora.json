My apologies if I missed one or two. I did not include the songs from George's 1967 album \"Wonderwall Music\" or his 1969 album \"Electronic Sound\" because they were solo albums and not many people have actually heard them. On September 22, 2014, they were re-released both separately and as part of a box set called \"The Apple Years 1968-1975\"). ",

            "answer_text": "Something is probably his most memorable but to list them all off the top of my head would be tough. Don't Bother Me George wrote while in hospital and not feeling well and just wanted to be left alone!! Piggies from the White album which his mom gave him the line \" what they need's a damn good whacking \". Savoy Truffle was written by him aimed at Eric Claptons love for candies. Good News was a brand of candy. Yes, you'll have to have them all pulled out after the Savoy Truffle! Lol. The Inner Light was George's. I think it was originally only on the B side of the Lady Madonna 45. Indian influence! Old Brown shoe was his also. Of course Taxman was a brilliant and slightly controversial song by George about the British high taxes. There's one for you, nineteen for me! Lol. I want to tell you is his also. You like me too much is George's too. I need you from HELPis his. Of course, While my guitar gently weeps. Here comes the sun was written by George in Eric Claptons back yard in the early morning! And my personal favorite \" Within you, Without you, from Sgt. Pepper. The lyrics just blow me away. I might have missed a few but I'm working by mostly memory. Of course George wrote many songs for the Beatles that were voted out, but toward the end he had compiled a lot of good stuff which landed on the All Things Must Pass album set which kicked ass on the other 3 Beatles first solo releases!! I hope I helped you guys! Peace. OM.  ",
