            "answer_text": "There are softwares which can remove vocals from a song. However, only stereo songs can be processed also depending on how the stereo of the song is separated. About 85% of the vocals, not 100%, can be diminished. But any, or all other sounds coming in the same frequency and position along with the vocals, will also be removed. Vocal removing software will give you a basic track needed for practicing, not performance. So, you cannot get clean karaoke from original song. :) ",
