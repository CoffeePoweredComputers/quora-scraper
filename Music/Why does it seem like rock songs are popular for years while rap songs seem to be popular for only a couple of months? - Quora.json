            "answer_text": "When I was a teenager, long ago, my father and I would have \u201cdiscussions\u201d about my choice of music. It was the 60\u2019s, when rock\u2019n\u2019roll was really gaining traction. Paul Revere and the Raiders, Kingsmen, Sonic, and many others were local bands that Played at area dances every weekend and eventually some degree of national attention. Remember, there was no internet so what we knew was mainly what we heard, those that toured to big cities, and the 45\u2019s we bought at the local music store. Then there were The Beach Boys, The English Invasion, and the West Coast(LA and SF) Bands\u2026and the rest is history. My father grew up in the 30\u2019s and went to War in the 40\u2019s. He played the Piano, Saxophone, Clarinet, and the military he played in a band. His music was \u201cBig Bands\u201d, Benny Goodman and other well known bands. He loved Ella Fitzgerald, Billy Holliday, Nancy Wilson, Perry Como, Frank Sinatra and many others that sang with the bands. Post WWII he discover Jazz and he loved it. And he never liked or understood Rock. But his main point to back up his dislike for any Modern Music was that it didn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t be popular for for decades like his music. That was his definition of good music. We, the teenagers, didn\u2019t care. We liked the ever changing world of Rock, R&B, psychedelic, Motown, The Philly sound, the LA sounded and many more. As I have gotten older my musical taste have not change too much. My I pod and Apple music have kept me Stocked with Alt, Indie, Blues(Electric), Rock, Hard Rock, International, etc. My point is that music is somewhat generational. You tend to like music that makes sense to you based on the times you grow up in. What were your influences and what music speaks to you. My Dad was partially right that rock songs would not last. A lot has not, but there have been and continue to have great and entertaining music from this genre. Rap is not my cup of tea and it may seem that it slow to gain traction with baby boomers, but Rap is for you and as it grows and morphs into something we have yet to name it will continue to speak to future generations. Remember it is quality, not quantity or longevity. 09 ",

Just because you don\u2019t know about them, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not popular. You also do know that a lot of rock songs last a couple of months and then disappear, right? ",
