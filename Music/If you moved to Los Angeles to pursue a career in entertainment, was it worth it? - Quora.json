            "answer_text": "tl;dr - yes, it is worth it I moved to Hollywood in late 2001. I moved here to be with a woman I fell in love with. My life up until that point ended sort of drastically, so I uprooted and moved to be with her. As of early 2019, we\u2019re still together, and I wake up happy every morning. But that\u2019s just the personal side of things\u2026 the entertainment industry thing is what you\u2019re asking\u2026 note that I answered the important part above\u2026 if you don\u2019t have your personal life set for making you happy, the entertainment industry will only make things worse, so be happy with your life first. There are many measures of success in the public\u2019s understanding of the entertainment industry, fame, fortune, acclaim, glamorous photos in all kinds of locations across the world\u2026 Within the industry itself, working in the sausage factory, there are so many other measures of success. The most telling measure of success is whether or not you have a day job or a job-job, a job that is not related to the industry that you have to take because the money you make in the industry cannot support your at anything like a reasonable standard of living. And you almost never hear about any of them. Most of the people who work in the entertainment industry, and I mean most actors, directors, writers, managers, most everyone who works in the industry have a job-job that they rely on to make ends meet. Most. Anyone who earns their living entirely within the entertainment industry is fortunate indeed. I have not had a job-job for over 15 years. Now, I do lots of weird work in the industry, and ideally you\u2019ve never actually heard of me, but I pay my rent inside the entertainment industry, and have almost from the moment I moved to Hollywood. I\u2019m remarkably lucky. I also work really hard. I will likely never have fame or glamor or fortune. But I didn\u2019t move to Hollywood for those things. I moved here for a girl and a life, and it was soooo worth it. ",

            "answer_text": "I came to the west coast to get \u201ca\u201d job. I\u2019d been looking back east where I lived for going on 2 years and not even an interview. It seemed that I\u2019d have much better luck in San Diego, and I did. As it happens, I got a job with a vendor in the entertainment industry. That was 30 years ago and I\u2019m still here, same company, although they moved me to Los Angeles a year after starting. It\u2019s been far more good than bad, though I\u2019m not actually \u201cin\u201d the industry but just with a vendor. The extent of my \u201cin\u201d was when I agreed to do post production accounting on two different projects years ago. I did that as a favor in addition to my day job. The funny thing is, I got the job in part due to a question my original COO asked me. \u201cWhere do you see yourself in Hollywood?\u201d Nowhere I said, I\u2019m an accountant, not an actor. Although this was a division of the vendor I\u2019ve been with, there was no way to know that when I was interviewing. They only told me that it was a revolutionary cost accounting based software but never mentioned for whom. The COO vaguely mentioned being an independent division of a bigger company up in Burbank. Two weeks later, the COO came into my office, told me that my boss said I was already proving to be a superstar. So now it was time to come clean and tell me who we were affiliated with. Then he said \u201cbut you made clear you had no interest in Hollywood and yet you were able to answer all my questions such as what does above the line mean and other industry terms.\u201d For someone with no interest, so you say, you were the only candidate who could answer all my questions. \u201cEasy,\u201d I said, \u201cI was a working musician for 7 years early on and my mom worked in radio in the 1940s and then TV in the 1950s. All strictly local of course. As a good mom, she\u2019d watch shows with me as a kid and I probably learned a lot more about production than the average kid living 2,800 miles away from Hollywood. It was what insiders knew back then \u2014 say about the Disney kids \u2014 that convinced my mom that I\u2019d never work in entertainment if she had any say over it. But that\u2019s how I knew all of your terms.\u201d ",
