            "answer_text": "Everything you write in a score must accurately portray the artistic idea that will make for the most engaging experience. Atonality, chaotic textures, and other contemporary musical sounds tend to evoke feelings of irreducible complexity, mystery, unease, contemplation, etc. If these are not moods you want to convey, no worries; but if these are moods you want to convey, even in just the subtlest ways, you must use these techniques at least a little. There is no one right amount of these techniques to use. The right amount depends on how often you want to convey the types of moods these techniques tend to convey. Generally speaking, these moods are disengaging if not carefully placed among other more pleasant sounds, or if used alone for an extended period of the score. If you study the scores of famous contemporary movie composers, you might be surprised at how much atonality they sneak into under otherwise tuneful themes. ",
