            "answer_text": "I take it you\u2019ve seen Eilish\u2019s video for \u201cAll the Good Girls Go to Hell\u201d\u2026 and now you\u2019re assuming she\u2019s somehow \u201csatanic\u201d? Apparently that means she's also; ... a serial killer? (Bellyache) ... or the monster under your bed? (Bury a Friend) ... or a woman who jumped off a roof (Listen Before I Go) ... or an evil spider queen rising to power? (You Should See Me In a Crown) ... or a boy that got dumped (by Billie)? (8) ... or a mean-hearted, homewrecking woman? (Bad Guy) ... or a creepy stalker? (Hostage) Or is it perhaps more plausible that Billie writes a lot of fictional tales? I would think it\u2019s quite obvious to everyone that has had a glance at her music catalog, that she writes from a LOT of different fictional character viewpoints? Probably half her music is pure fiction, and written as entertainment. Much of the rest is observational, and written from the viewpoint of someone other than herself (also kind of fictional). She\u2019s a teenager and doesn\u2019t have enough life experience to write a lot of deeply personal stories. She\u2019s got maybe 2 or 3 songs that she\u2019s claimed are actually about her personally. But somehow there are people who want to take an OBVIOUSLY fictional tale, and pretend it should be taken literally. And they\u2019re using that as an excuse to get angry and forbid their kids from listening to her music. Just pathetic. ",
