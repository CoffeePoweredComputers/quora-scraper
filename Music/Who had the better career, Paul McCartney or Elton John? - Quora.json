            "answer_text": "Its a very interesting question. No other band has had the highs of the Beatles, nobody has had the cultural influence or the staying power. For that, you could easily say Paul McCartney. But Elton has had a remarkably successful career that has spanned a very long time, plus huge non-rock success with things like Lion King. Paul as a solo artist or with Wings has 9 #1, 22 Top 10 and 46 Hot 100. Elton has 9 #1, 27 Top 10 and 87 longs on the billboard charts. Remember the Beatles are not included in Paul\u2019s totals. So, this is a remarkably hard question to answer. Lets just say they are two of the greatest ever in the rock era. ",
