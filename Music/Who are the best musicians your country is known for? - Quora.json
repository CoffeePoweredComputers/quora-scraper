            "answer_text": "The best musicians my country is known for? That\u2019s a tough one. The musicians my country is best known for are Bono, The Edge, Adam and Larry, but while the boys are willing (rather too willing, in my view) to be regarded as \u2018the greatest rock & roll band in the world\u2019, or whatever, they are far from what I consider the \u2018best musicians my country is known for\u2019. The problem is really that my country isn\u2019t known for many other musicians. My favourite Irish band, Thin Lizzy, is not all that well known and I don\u2019t think many people even realise that the band was (mostly) Irish. My opinion of almost all other Irish pop and rock musicians is, well, low. In my opinion, the best musicians my country is known for are less well-known, but still eminent: Johnny DoranLiam O\u2019Flynn (RIP, March 2018)Ronan BrowneJulia CliffordSeamus EnnisWillie ClancyTommy PeoplesTr\u00edona N\u00ed DhomhnaillMatt MolloyTommy PottsBobby CaseyMichael ColemanArty McGlynnPaddy KeenanBut I do also like the music of one Irish singer-songwriter who has slowly matured, from rather derivative and quirky beginnings, into a strong and distinctive voice: Lisa HanniganEdit: People keep bringing up famous Irish pop and rock musicians in comments, as if I had somehow forgotten about them and would give them credit for being really good musicians if I had only remembered them. I hadn\u2019t and I wouldn\u2019t. ",
