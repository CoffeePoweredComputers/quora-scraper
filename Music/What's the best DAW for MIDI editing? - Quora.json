            "answer_text": "For the PC: Cakewalk SONAR - I think you can get this for free now. and if not, it should not be difficult to find a copy of the last version that was published. This was one of the earliest sequencers for the PC and over the course of many years, some of the improvements and refinements that were made to this piece of software were copied and incorporated by most other DAWs and became standard features you now expect to see in any serious DAW. A good example: the piano roll view.For the Mac: Apple Logic Pro X - A very capable MIDI editor that will handle any sort of MIDI file you can throw at it. Used to be available for both PC and Mac until Apple bought it and made it Mac-only. At $199, this is one of the finest DAWs you can buy at any price, And comes with a great deal of MIDI and audio plugins. If that were not enough, if you pay $30 for Mainstage, you can take your projects with you onstage with all of the same instruments and plugins you used in Logic Pro XOther contenders: Cubase - for both Mac and PC. This DAW was bought by Yamaha and has languished ever since, allowing Ableton Live and other DAWs to take the lead. However, it is still a good choice although a bit high on price.Reaper - not the easiest DAW on the market but a very capable one indeed. The price is right if you don\u2019t mind rolling up your sleeves and figure out how this works.NOT Good MIDI Editors (Stay away from these if you want serious MIDI editing capabilities: Ableton Live - great for sketching out ideas on the fly, horrible MIDI editor.Bitwig - same as above. Really bad for MIDI editing.",

            "answer_text": "I think it depends an your experience with several DAW\u2019s and editing midi with them . Logic Pro x has some limitations if you want to edit and transform midi data in great detail but is perfectly useable for most producers . I think Cubase has the most detailed midi editing , along with Digital performer , other programs like Sonar / Reaper etc etc , are also very good ,but I haven\u2019t worked with them anywhere as much as I have the others I mentioned . Studio one which I have worked with recently does not in IMHO have deep editing facilities yet . Pro tools is also very flexible now as regards midi editing \u2014 it wasn\u2019t always this way .So it comes down to the question of what style are you producing , as if it\u2019s anything to do with writing for media , TV and Film ( and of course Game audio) then only Cubase/ Nuendo and DP will provide enough options . If you are writing towards commercial release of songs , then any of the programs will suffice as todays music doesn\u2019t need that much work ,( no offence meant!) so an in-depth midi facility would be a waste as you really need the best loop manipulation for todays chart material .
