            "answer_text": "There are two guitarists playing the solos at the end of Hotel California: Don Felder (who also wrote the song music) and Joe Walsh. Felder played the first solo, Walsh the second and afterwards both trade licks and harmonise till the end of the song. You can see quite clearly what does each play in this video taken from the Hotel California tour. They play the song very much as in the record, including the solos. Don Felder is the guy playing a twin neck guitar and Joe Walsh, the guy wearing a bandanna:  Both are still active. Joe Walsh has been a part of the Eagles ever since 1975 and he still plays with the band occasionally, while also playing solo and with lots of other artists. Don Felder, on the contrary, was fired from the Eagles back in 2001 and is reported to not having even spoken again with Don Henley or Glen Frey. He has been playing with his own band since. ",
