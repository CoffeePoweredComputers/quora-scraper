            "answer_text": "Thank you for asking. I say yes Freddie Mercury was important even then because If I see new music programs created by the living members their speeches on stage about music world is not complete without Rip Freddie\u2019s name being mentioned. Yes not to underscore but for me the public viewers adds value to each members if Freddie is attached to them until now. The movie which R.Malek performed is one evidence that Freddie existence is Vip. I read latest article that Brian May also thought of Ben Wishaw to be the next Freddie in the movie to rock the world. (I a little bit do encloser to Ben Wishaw here about his movie on the Perfume, where in he completed the last note of his experiment killing women. I sense that his personality resemble Freddie.) I thumbs up to Brian May so with Roger and John. This is how the members show how Rip Freddie is important even then. Sometimes we the audience have many speculations but Freddie said he did it for love and money so with the living members. ",

Seriously, Unique singers and outgoing front men who can play and write are damn near impossible to come by. Let alone someone of his caliber on all fronts. Freddie had a lot to say about their direction. Being in a band is just like a good marriage- they usually supported his efforts. ",
