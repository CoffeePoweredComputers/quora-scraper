            "answer_text": "As Scott said, planning an adventure that\u2019s \u201crisky but not too risky\u201d really depends on the person in question and what his or her perception of risk is. What may seem intimidating to you may actually be fun and exciting to someone who has a lot of skill and experience in that area. But if you\u2019re looking to invite more adventure into your life and are wondering how to take the first step, here\u2019s what I would recommend: Start with a bit of soul searching. Ask yourself what kind of adventurer you dream of becoming. Do you dream about learning to sail? Completing a multi-day backpacking trip? Traveling through Southeast Asia? What would you do if there were no risks at all? Once you have an adventure goal in mind, take the time to sit down and reverse-engineer it. Work backwards and make a list of all the \u201cpractice\u201d adventures you would have to go on to be fully prepared for you goal. What are the skills you would have to master? What areas would you need to build your confidence in? Think of these as the steps you\u2019d have to take if you really wanted to achieve your adventure goal one day. Then take your list and do the following, without spending too much time thinking about each item: Cross out everything on your list that really scares you.Circle all of the things you would try today.What\u2019s left over? These are the experiences that live just beyond the edges of your comfort zone. These are the adventures that will be \u201crisky-but-not-too-risky\u201d for YOU.  While they still may feel a little intimidating, they will challenge you. If you\u2019re successful, they will inspire you to progress. And if you keep at it, you just might become the adventurer you dream of being. Best of luck in your adventures and let us know how it goes! ",

            "answer_text": "That would depend on what you consider \u201ctoo risky\u201d. Is it the probability of death, or would you be more worried about the type of injury? Driving is a very risky adventure. In 2016 there were 11.95 fatalities per 100,000 population. Statistics compiled by American Whitewater researcher Laura Whitman in 1998. Activity Fatalities per 100,000 Episodes. Scuba Diving - 3.5 Climbing - 3.2 Whitewater Kayaking - 2.9 Recreational Swimming - 2.6 Bicycling - 1.6 Whitewater Boating/Rafting - 0.86 Hunting - 0.7 Skiing/Snowboarding - 4  I personally enjoy Mountain Biking, Whitewater Kayaking, Snowboarding, and Target Shooting. I also used to ride a motorcycle. These are not typical activities for a Risk Manager, but we each have our own level of risk acceptance. I protect my family from my risk by purchasing life insurance. ",
