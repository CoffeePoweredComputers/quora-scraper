            "answer_text": "The Billie Eilish I know is from her former years. When her then song - Six feet under had come out, she was hardly 15 years old. This song holds a special place because she sings about death so effortlessly and sweetly, so much that the idea of death ceases to appear as dreadful - but almost as a mellow haunting, coming from her.  I am not that a big fan of her present music - surely she has evolved her style and since only grown bigger & better as a human/artist, but it just doesn\u2019t keep me as invested as her old songs did. Until then this stays as my most fav song of hers and I don\u2019t see that changing anytime soon. ",

            "answer_text": "Lovely - it\u2019s about depression and in the official music video billie and khalid were trapped in a box w/ a storm over them bc that\u2019s what it feels like. Everything I wanted - In her dream, she was gonna commit suicide and her friends didn\u2019t care.. but she woke up to see her brother by her side and he\u2019ll always be there for her. Six feet under - It\u2019s a reference to someone who was loved, and they died. ",
