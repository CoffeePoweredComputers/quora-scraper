            "answer_text": "It depends. On Who you are, your background, education, how much you and what You read. Depends on your predominant mood and other things. Listen to anything You can including all reccommendations made here. When listening try to close your eyes and to check what is the first thing You feel. I still remember that moment almost 25 years ago when I listened M\u00e1ster of Puppets of Metallica and Kiss Alive III by the first time. Something made \u201cclic\u201d and my life changed for ever. Just wanted more and more and many other rock and metal bands crossed my path. My personal soundtrack started to be created. I learnt that masterpieces are created by something beyond the control of the composer or band. Is a kind of pure energy flowing from tracks to speakers and altering enery at the place where is played. Those pieces are recorded by musicians on a state of mind where they don't want to impress anyone and are playing from hearth. Even if You don't understand lyrics for being in another languaje You Will feel the sincereness of that piece of music. For example, most of the religious music( Christian, gospel, gregorian Chants, japanese Zen sakuhachi, hindi Citar music, muslim Quoram's prayings,) have this ingredients. For me the wave of PinkFloyd and Enigma arrived like a tsunami. Also Slayer, Megadeth and most of the 80s hard rock bands, Deep Purple, The Doors and sychodelic bands from US West Coast in the 60s. Recently I listened more Electronic music from Ministry of Sound, HedKandi, and the compilations from Fabric Club in London. Travelling and listening to musicians at their born place is a very Rich experience. When listening Scorpions in Hamburg and Coldplay in London I felt true happiness on those musicians and their music. Just caused by playing at home. Good to know the place where music is made. That \u00e1lbum Viva la Vida was strong Just after living a winter in England. Duran Duran songs had more impact when travelling by the London Underground. Cuban music and salsa got stronger when listened on Miami and when travelling to North Florida and radio stations started to play country music, the landscape changed completely. With time You Will change as a person and your tastes will also do. When You feel music as repetitive and You start to feel less impressed by something New on the generes You tipically listen to, have a radical change. 7 years ago I jumped into Electronic, and at same time started playing Mozart and argentinian tango intensively. Now I jumped into bossa nova, samba and Brasilian music from different regions. Also Colombian Caribbean music and more and more Flamenco. I Will never forget the Blues and classic rock but I felt I won't be able to listen same music every single Day and month. Uh? Reccomendations? The 3 songs on my personal list were made by argentinian band Soda Stereo. A mix of hedonist, dark and sweet notes made by Gustavo Cerati on a time when most of the rock coming from Argentina was full of rage and mellancolic sounds after the 1976-1983 dictatorship ended. Be open minded. World is full of musical jewels waiting to be discovered, tasted and enjoyed. Even out of the mainstream anglo-saxon music stablishment are comercial and less commercial music, sincere and full of good energy waiting for You to shake the ground you step! ",

I\u2019m happy to give you some music recommendations, but you probably won\u2019t like them since I mostly listen to music in Japanese.

Because it is simply the best. And it is also the most diverse. From Gregorian chants, to madrigals, to motets, to Bach, to Beethoven, to Barber, all the way to modern minimalists like Adams, Glass, and Corigliano, there is simply MORE THERE. So what should you start with? Why, the Greatest Hits, of course. Bach's Brandenburg Concertos. Vivaldi's Four Seasons. Beethoven's Fifth and Ninth Symphonies. Anything by Chopin. Even Stravinsky's Rite of Spring, Barber's Adagio For Strings (which Oliver Stone used in his film Platoon), and the equally tear-jerking soundtrack for the documentary film The Fog of War by modern minimalist composer Philip Glass, if you're feeling adventurous. Then you can graduate to the more challenging modern nationalist composers like Grieg, Dvorak, Sibelius, and Rachmaninov (among many others!). If you come to appreciate this genre of music, I guarantee that you will also appreciate the best of what popular music has to offer. It certainly happened to me. Happy listening! ",

If you're into bands like Panic! at the Disco and twenty one pilots, I would recommend some of the older artists that influenced them, like Depeche Mode, or maybe David Bowie. If you're more into the darker side of the artists you mentioned, I would recommend that you try listening to acts like Skinny Puppy or Nine Inch Nails. These are not for everyone, but they are at least worth a listen. If you are into the more alternative rock side, there are plenty of others that are fairly similar, such as Franz Ferdinand and MISSIO. I hope this helped! ",

John Williams, Jerry Goldsmith, Lalo Shifrin were some of the composers from the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s that come to mind immediately. The soundtrack for \u201cPapillon\u201d, \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back\u201d are notable listens. The original soundtrack by Vangelis for \u201cBladerunner\u201d is amazing. A more contemporary artist of note is Yoko Kanno, who is truly a musical chameleon. Most of her work has been done for Anime , but well worth your time. ",

Sign of the times is good listen) One direction (Don\u2019t listen to their first 2 albums. Listen to their albums named four and Made in the AM. Almost all the songs are good in four.) Here are artists you should not listen to : Justin Bieber.

There was a cross pollination from 70\u201380s punk rock. This is where Goth, Punk, Thrash, and Emo derive from. Listen to this and see if anything happens.  If you wanna listen to some Psychedelic Rock, Blood Ceremony and Jess and the Ancient Ones are rad and those lead back to Mercyful Fate, Iron Maiden, Jethro Tull, and Black Sabbath. On the general rock n roll side, checkout The Hellacopters who are basically the Swedish MC5. One other band I highly recommend is Opeth. I don\u2019t know your taste in the heavier side of thing but they acoustic tracks are majestic.  Basically if its Scandinavian, it must be worth listening: Abba, Europe, Bjork, Solstafir, Wardruna, In Flames, and more. ",
