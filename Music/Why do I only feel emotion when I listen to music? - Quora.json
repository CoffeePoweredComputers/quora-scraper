            "answer_text": "Hey .. first of all same pinch..!! :P I, too, feel emotional while listening to music and I think it\u2019s really common for all the music lovers out there..!! Emotions are really interesting when it comes to music.. sometimes lyrics makes you feel your inner-self, sometimes vocals strikes your heart, sometimes only a small music just by an instrument can take you to a deep ride of emotions..!! And it\u2019s so beautiful to have this feeling, it\u2019s like pausing this world for few moments and just realizing that \u201cYes\u2026. This is it.. and I exist ..!!!\u201d I don\u2019t even have words to explain what it\u2019s like to have a good soulful music in my ears, that circulates in my entire body and soul..!! The reason of being emotional is something like this.. if we listen to happy or happening song , then it makes us energetic, if we listen to any sad or slow song, feels like pouring our heart out right away, and in some cases may be crying out loud... because we start to connect our life to the music, and whenever you connect your life to something, you can actually feel it.. just like as it\u2019s a part of you, that\u2019s why we have a emotional \u2013 roller \u2013 coaster ride when we listen music..!! (Atleast I think so..)I am really sorry if you were expecting any scientific answer.. because personally I don\u2019t like describing \"feelings\" with science.. ;). Hope you\u2019ll enjoy the music like this.. always .. Have a happy life..!! :) \uf04a ",

            "answer_text": "music taps into the subconcious. We remember music easier than words. We attach the music we hear to an event, when we file it in our brain. So hearing that music releases the tag to an emotion that we felt last time we heard it. some people have trouble showing emotion, e.g. Autistic people and others .. Music helps them to release their emotions. the old saying\u2026music heals the soul..is true. our brain receptors pick up on music subliminally even if listening to a conversation. Hence, supermarkets use of them to relax you so that you stay longer. If you stay longer, there\u2019s a high chance that you will spend more. ",
