This process takes years of research and experimentation to become proficient in. There is a vast network of resources at your disposal on our internet to help you in your discovery of audio production techniques.

            "answer_text": "There is a lot of software to improve the sound of music. Most studios now use Pro Tools to adjust and manipulate the music to improve it. Among the options are the famous / infamous auto-tune to make the vocals in key, quantise is used to make the time accurate, a de-esser to remove sibilance etc. It all depends on what type of music you are talking about ",
