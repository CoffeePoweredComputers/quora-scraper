            "answer_text": "It can. A couple of anecdotes I\u2019ve recently heard prove his level of niceness: Alec Baldwin recently DJ\u2019d a Sirius radio piece for their new Beatles channel in which he recalled working with Paul for an episode of Saturday Night Live. Baldwin was hosting and Paul was the guest musician that particular week. A life long rabid Beatles fan, Baldwin remembers being petrified, not knowing how to act or what to say to Sir at their first meeting for the show\u2019s rehearsals. Linda, seeing his hesitation, approached Alec and said, \u201cJust talk to him like he\u2019s a regular guy. That\u2019s what he really wants.\u201d Baldwin thinks, \u201cYeah, right, like that\u2019s not happening!\u201d Alec said over the course of the week-long project, though, Paul really made an effort to put him at ease and was very likable, down-to-Earth and kind. The leader of the band Elbow commented (on the same Sirius radio channel) that he\u2019d received a congratulatory, approving email from Paul. He\u2019d heard their song \u2018Magnificent\u2019 on the radio and liked it. An official nod from Sir Paul? Of course, that meant everything to the band, and they were moved and awestruck that he went out of his way to write them. They saw Paul\u2019s daughter Stella at Glastonbury and mentioned the email to her and how much they appreciated it. She burst into tears, saying, \u201cMy dad\u2019s got such a big heart!\u201d Addition: Just watched the long commentary special feature after the restored version of Yellow Submarine narrated by the film\u2019s line producer John Coates. He met and mingled with the Beatles quite a few times during the film\u2019s production in 1967\u20138. In his very upper crust accent he flatly states that although his musical tastes ran more towards Mozart, all four of the Beatles were nice. They were relaxed, funny - just the kind of guys you\u2019d have hoped they\u2019d be. ",

            "answer_text": "WOW so many negative answers here. I guess I will be the one to disagree. I have been in the music business for over 40 years and have met so many great artist unfortunately Paul isn\u2019t one of them at least not yet. Some people you would think would be total divas have turned out to be really nice guys. I can name a few like Jon Bon jovi and Sammy Hagar for example. From everything I\u2019ve seen and heard Paul is supposed to be a very nice guy. I do know people that have met him a few times. Look at it this way, while the other Beatles were living in mansions and part of high society Paul lived on a farm with Linda and his kids. He raised Linda\u2019s daughter like she was his own and brought them all up to be respectful and good people. While living on the farm they were eating dinner (lamb) and were looking out the window at the sheep on the farm and realized that is what they were eating. That made him stop and rethink on how they were eating and became vegetarians. He has for years donated to many charities but never really wanted this to be public knowledge. He did it because he thought it was a great cause not because he wanted recognition. Paul would rather have a 5 minute or longer conversation than sign an autograph because it is more meaningful. I\u2019m sure Paul does realize just how famous and important he is in the world of music but isn\u2019t a diva. While he is a perfectionist and wants things right he is just as hard on himself and maybe harder than he is on everyone else. In the world of music I would say Paul is a pretty nice guy.I know I\u2019d love to work with him. ",

            "answer_text": "I do not know how anyone can make a judgment based on second-hand information. I don\u2019t know Paul McCartney AT ALL. However, I have watched him and studied him since I was nine in 1964. Here is one story that I know to be true about Paul: John and Paul were huge fans of the Everly Brothers. When they were 15 and 16 respectively, they got to go see an Everly\u2019s concert. They waited at the stage door to meet them. Apparently, the Everly brothers were kind and treated John and Paul well. Paul tells this story often. Now, everytime he gets frustrated by or tired of fans and their demands, he remembers how HE felt as a fan, and it helps him to respond kindly and respectfully. I also refer you to my earlier post regarding Paul and how he treated my Mom at a concert he gave in Columbia, SC, 1992 I think. I won\u2019t go into that again, but you can find it. What he did has remained with her for the almost thirty years since, even though her mind is riddled by Alzheimers. It was that meaningful to her. I hope that someday, my \u201cmake a wish\u201d comes true, and I actually get to meet him. He has had a huge impact on my life, and that\u2019s not easy for a 64-year-old man to admit, but it\u2019s true. At that time I hope that my opinion of him doesn\u2019t change. I don\u2019t think it will ",

Myself, I don\u2019t want to go through life looking for people who are \u201cnice\u201d. I want \u201cauthentic\u201d. From any interviews I\u2019ve seen of Paul McCartney, he seems witty and creative with a good edge of self-respect and being aware of the context he\u2019s in (being in the Beatles would be good training for that, since the situations were so extreme). I think if I was at some event he was at and people were hanging out at half time and some such thing, I\u2019d enjoy talking with him because he has that fun sense of humor and creativity and music as I do too. When people are always or obviously \u201cnice\u201d, it can often be because they\u2019re turning themselves OFF so much, or putting on such a phony, slick persona for people, it\u2019s not at all authentic. I\u2019d far prefer to have to figure out how to deal with someone who was authentic with me and had an awkward edge to them, than if they were just \u201cnice\u201d, as if they were a talking welcome mat at a grocery store. I hate being patronized, manipulated, fooled or ripped off, so there\u2019s one answer for ya. ",

            "answer_text": "Based on what I\u2019ve learned about Paul, it seems like that is a bit of a tricky question. It sounds like he is a man of immense contradictions. He can at once be incredibly generous, even out of the blue generous for people he doesn\u2019t know, but at the same time can be almost absurdly cheap in how he treats his mates. He paid his Wings mates pretty much scale and kept them in squalor for many of those years. Based on many views of people he has worked with, musically, he can be pushy, overbearing, and unrelenting. He also does not take criticism all that well. He has had some bad press moments through the years that I think have led to some people questioning just how nice/caring of a guy is this\u2026..his comments after Lennon was killed\u2026.\u201dIt\u2019s a drag\u201d raised a lot of eyebrows, but I didn\u2019t really take it as being mean or uncaring. I mean, what can you say, and why is someone asking him how he feels??? I always got the sense that Paul was a bit of a mystery. I think he tries very hard to project a certain image instead of just being himself. In effect, I think he is a fairly insecure guy\u2026which is strange. But, he has an incredible love for animals, so how bad a guy can he be?? :) ",

My take is\u2026. you might be right - when you meet Paul McCartney - the image he projects is one of the nicest people in the world. What I mean by that is, I think Paul is acting a lot. Here\u2019s a guy that\u2019s been a superstar all his life. He has NO concept of any other world. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s insincere or a bad guy, but, I think he puts on a little act when the cameras are rolling\u2026. I have heard nothing about him being a jerk - all I\u2019m saying is - he puts on a little show when you meet him. He\u2019s like Robin Williams was (to a lesser degree) - he\u2019s always \u2018on\u2019. I don\u2019t know if that makes any sense\u2026 If you ever get to see Broad Street (the movie) - it\u2019s kinda like that. He\u2019s trying to be a normal guy, but, he has no clue on how to be a normal guy - so he \u2018acts\u2019 like one :) ",

Jimmy played 13 dates on the Beatles 1964 tour of New Zealand, Australia and Hong Kong. He, my dad and a few of their friends met up with Jimmy afterwards. Jimmy said it was one of his worst experiences as a musician. To begin with, once he was told he got the job he was instructed that he had to play \u201clike Ringo.\u201d Jimmy told them he was a classically trained drummer and couldnt switch his style. He also stated that the Beatles were the most arrogant S.O.B.s he\u2019s ever had the misfortune of playing with. Outside of TV interviews and rehearsals the rest of the band wouldn't speak to him. When asked if he\u2019d ever play with them again, Jimmy replied with \u201cNever.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "I think we should always be mindful that the public image of celebrities is not necessarily their true nature. Let\u2019s be real here, famous people are like PR creations, their character is carefully tailored, and very often professionally designed. How they appear in public, their political ideas, who they support, what products they endorse, what clothing, car brand, type of housing they have - it is all a careful project. The true nature of people is never what you see each day-we each have a \u2018private self\u2019 that we carefully conceal. It is not just \u2018psychopaths\u2019 that have a \u2018Mask\u2019, it is a human trait. So, who knows, Mr McCartney could be a darling, he might be sweet as Cherry pie to people and those he loves; then again he might be irritable, arrogant, impatient\u2026we shall never truly know, and that is the way of things.

And there was one doc where he was walking in New York City. He gets in his car and George the driver takes off. But before they can get very far a fan starts chasing. Paul recognizes him as a seller on Ebay. In other words, he gets stuff autographed then sells it. So Paul tells George to speed up and then he says wait. George stops and Paul signs whatever the guy wants signed. Ringo wont even do that. So I think deep down he is probably a nice guy. Yeah he is protected. He should be. ",
