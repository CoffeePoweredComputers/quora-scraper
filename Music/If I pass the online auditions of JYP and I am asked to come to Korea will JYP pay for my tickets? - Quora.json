            "answer_text": "Tbh, I doubt. A lot of idols (idk if this is specific to JYP) have talked about how their agency won\u2019t pay for stuff. I don\u2019t remember the group, but a girl group who went on a singing competition show wanted to do a popular song but their agency wouldn\u2019t pay for any royalties so I believe they ended up writing their own. Unless they are super super impressed with you (most of the talented idols didn\u2019t even get this) and are like we can\u2019t let this one get away, I think you\u2019ll have to pay your way there as well as pay back debts later on for training and everything. Idk if you\u2019ve done this yet, but research the process. If you make it through trainee days, you might become big and make bank. If you don\u2019t make it through training or don\u2019t make bank, you\u2019ll be left with a lot of debt you\u2019ll have to pay off. ",
