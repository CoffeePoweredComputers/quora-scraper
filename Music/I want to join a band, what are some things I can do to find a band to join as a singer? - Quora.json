            "answer_text": "Invest in a PA system. Doesn\u2019t have to be elaborate, but all the other players in the band have made significent investments in equipment so at the very least you should invest in a good singing mic, a stand, a small board, an amplifier, monitor and speakers that are suitable for, at very minimum, practice. This will signal that you are serious about what you want to do. An active speaker set up with one main speaker, a small monitor, and a small 4 channel mixing board will not set you back much but it will make it so you don\u2019t have to rely on someone else\u2019s equipment. Next I would echo other people to get out there at open mic nights and karaoke. Maybe have someone make a video. Your Small PA set up will allow you to do open mic nights with a backing track. Finally, learn how to play guitar (or piano, but that would cost a little more money), you wouldn\u2019t need to be all that good, just enough to play open or bar chords so you can accompany yourself if performing alone or at least add some volume to the sound of the band of some songs. It\u2019s not hard and well worth some time. ",

            "answer_text": "Band is you see , a combination of friends or known people.. For getting into a band tou need to, known to some group, who are making it now. Or you also can get some of your guitarist,keyboard or keybord player friends and have a start. As i know most of the cases the band members are constant, and any replacement (most of cases) demotivates its performance.. But yes there may be some scope, very less but yes you have. One of myfriends once requested in such a case, actually it was a group of medical college students who writes lyrics,composes,play instruments and sing also..but for some of tracks they wanted a classical singer..and it was my friend.. Also some bands need 2 vocals for effects,so in that case you definately can be 2nd one initially and within months you will be core member and active singer..in the band. :) Think about it , let me know :) ",
