            "answer_text": "I think many of them have equally dirty minds! But it's just who shows it the most. I would definitely rank Mark, Ten, and Taeyong for the suspicious things that they say all the time. Mark He always laughs at seemingly innocent comments, and there are many video compliations of him laughing at seemingly dirty statements. Some examples are when Mark, said \u201cthis is my first time -\u201d, and Johnny had to cut him off by saying his name in a very disapproving manner. Shows that Johnny knows Mark isn't an innocent soul! Or when Johnny and Mark went to make leather wallets together, and Johnny said \u201cwe'll be making each other -\u201d, but was cut off by Mark because he thought Johnny said something else (idk, maybe we'll be making out with each other? heh) Mark just laughs at everything tbh. But also dirty stuff. Ten The other answer covered Ten already so I won't talk too much about him, but he's also another one with a terrible mind. Just watch A Cup Of Coffee and you'll know. Taeyong This adorable boy is the person behind so many thirst songs in NCT. I'm pretty sure you know whiplash by now; he says he wants to be whipped more and tamed, and in Baby Don't Like It he raps \u201cI want you to hit and kick me, ruin me\u201d. If that's not TY being a \u201cfreaky deaky man\u201d (his lyrics from Mad City), I don't know what is. Honestly, taeyong doesn't really show that he's dirty in ways like Ten and Mark do, but his song lyrics really show what has been on his mind. Definitely not his sister. ",
