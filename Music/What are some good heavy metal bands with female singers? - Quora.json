            "answer_text": "Warlock was a heavy metal band back in the 80s. After the band broke up, their lead singer, Doro Pesch would start her solo career, playing music in the same style.   Unleash the Archers is a heavy/power metal band. And damn, their vocalist can hit those highs!   Arch Enemy is a melodic death metal band. Their first female vocalist, Angela Gossow, joined the band in 2000. Alissa White-Gluz has been vocalist since 2014.   Battle Beast is a power/heavy metal band:  Darkened Nocturn Slaughtercult is a band that plays black metal of the old-school style, fast, harsh, raw, & hard-hitting. As far as kvlt goes, they\u2019re pretty damn trve.  Babymetal is a band that mixes J-pop & metal. A lot of people hate them, but personally, I think they\u2019re great.  Kalevala is a folk metal band from Russia. I have no idea what she\u2019s singing about, but they sound good.  I really like In This Moment, but they\u2019re more alternative/mallcore than \u201ctrue\u201d metal:  Pretty much every symphonic or gothic metal band is female-fronted or uses \u2018beauty & the beast\u2019 vocals (clean female vocals & harsh male vocals), so I\u2019ll just leave a massive dump of bands here. They get shit on by some metalheads because they\u2019re so melodic, but I personally like them. Nemo by Nightwish:  Victims of Contingency by Epica:  Shot in the Dark by Within Temptation:  Emerald Island by Leaves\u2019 Eyes:  Carmilla by Theatres des Vampires  Siren by Theatre of Tragedy (this band is split-up now)  Year of the Rat by Tristania:  Trip the Darkness by Lacuna Coil:  Bloodflower by Draconian:  Dark Star by Tarja:  Dark Lantern by Mandragora Scream:  Nightfall by Xandria:  Here\u2019s My Hell by ReVamp (this band is split up now)  My Mind\u2019s Eye by Sirenia:  Beautifully Decayed by As Angels Bleed:  Son of the Sun by Therion:  Stardust by Delain:  ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll answer this just about classic metal bands from the 1970s and 1980s, since that\u2019s the era I know and listen to. Girlschool. One of the major all-female bands in metal. Did some very cool crossovers with Motorhead back in the early days. Still out there creating new albums and touring from time to time. Best known perhaps for this song, which got into the Metal Killers Kollection vol. 1  Rock Goddess. Another great British acid all-female band from the same era. They were a bit younger than Girlschool, and never became quite as big and well-connected, but they have some great stuff. A lot of sound coming out of that trio. They too are still producing new material and touring.  Acid: a less well known Belgian metal band, fronted by Kate De Lombaert. Heavy stuff, spread out over three good albums. If you haven\u2019t heard them, you definitely want to listen to their stuff  Bitch: an American band, fronted by Betsy \u201cBitch\u201d Weiss, who had a S&M motif going throughout their three main albums and touring. Had a lot of turnover among the male bandmembers. Recently reformed.  Warlock. German band fronted by Doro Pesch, who would then go off on a solo career, and do some collaborative work with Udo Dirkschneider. Good stuff there.  Plasmatics. Fronted by Wendy O\u2019 Williams, who then went solo herself. If you like it really raunchy and gritty, she\u2019s the one for you. Some might argue it\u2019s more punk than metal. Here\u2019s WOW on her own:  Depending on what you\u2019re into, you might also check out Lita Ford, Vixen, Hellion, Chastain, Malibu Barbi, Warbride, Leather Angel, Lee Aaron . . . the list could go on and on ",
