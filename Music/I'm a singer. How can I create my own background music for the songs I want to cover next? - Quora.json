            "answer_text": "You have to learn one instrument you would like to learn or at least music theories. If you are good at any instruments, example: if you are a guitar player who could play it well, just goto any studio and record the vocal and guitar. Another way is Music Programming (Making virtual instruments sounding like the real one without recording it, just by using sampled libraries) it\u2019s not easy as you thought to make it sound like real, You have to learn at least basic keyboard lessons and pick a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) and get the instrument sound you wants to be played with your vocals. For this you have to be a hardcore music programmer. I don't think this is a good idea for you. just mentioned to get you and idea about how it works. The easiest way is to find a good guitarist/keyboardist/the person who could play the instrument you would like to add on your cover song, Hire them and go to a recording studio (if you need great quality), or else record in your home studio setup. if you have one.

            "answer_text": "There are two ways to do this. Recording : If you play an instrument,for an instance,a guitar(most common) then you can compose the song according to your pitch and taste and then play and record it through a good quality microphone and a DAW(for ex,ProTools,Ableton,FL Studio),you can also use Audacity if find some trouble recording in DAW.Composing everything on an DAW : If you are a person who can't play any instrument (I'm one) , then don't worry. There are several softwares available on the Internet that enables the user to make music,using synthesizers. Many sound engineers have engineered the sound of real instruments using popular VST Plug-ins*. KSHMR & 7 Skies recently released their preset pack for Serum, you can check them. I also recommend trying a few Kontakt libraries because they are really very good, and I\u2019m talking about quality, ease of use and use friendly interfaces. (they are pretty heavy on the CPU though)",
