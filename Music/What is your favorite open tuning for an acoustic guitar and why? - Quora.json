            "answer_text": "Not an open tuning per se but I love All Fourths Tuning:  P4 tuning, or all fourths tuning, has seen a rise in popularity of late; simply tune your B string up to C and your high E string up to F, or if you don\u2019t like the added string tension tune the other four strings down a semitone (Eb, Ab, Db, Gb, B, E). What you get is a perfectly symmetrical fretboard as the distance between each string is a consistent 4th. Fourths tuning basically means that any chords shape or scale pattern you know on the first four strings of the guitar in standard tuning (E, A, D, G) can now be repeated on any set of strings, thereby reducing the amount of stuff to learn by about 75%. This huge time-saver is not without its shortcomings though as open position chords go out the window. What you gain, however, is greater access to scales and chords all over the fretboard which is great for jazz and fusion. I\u2019m a big fan of this tuning and have been using it for a couple of years. While you can still adapt a lot of material from standard tuning, if you\u2019re playing covers it\u2019s probably not worth the time investment. As for open tunings it would have to be DADGAD, there's just something ethereal about it, plus it always reminds of studying under the late, great Eric Roche. For him it was his 'standard tuning', and he could play pretty much anything in DADGAD, not just the usual jangly Irish stuff. ",

            "answer_text": "It's not an open tuning, but I've been obsessed recently with what I call Dropped E. It might have an official name but I don't know what it is. Just capo strings 1-5 at the second fret an DC play in D, which is actually E because of the capo. There are a few advantages over Dropped D. First, it's really fast and easy to get into and out of this \u201ctuning\u201d because you're not actually twisting any tuners, you're just throwing on (or removing) a capo. More importantly, this \u201ctuning\u201d has a big advantage over Dropped D. In dropped D, the D chord sounds great, but when you play a G or an A (the 4 & 5 chords) you have to change the fingerings because of the dropped tuning on the bass E string. In Dropped E you can play those chords the way you know and love them and they sound correct. If you never tried this trick, definitely give it a try. You can also try capoing strings 1-5 on the FOURTH fret, and playing in C. Same principle with a different feel. ",
