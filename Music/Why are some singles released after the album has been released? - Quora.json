            "answer_text": "Traditionally, singles used to come out before albums. That\u2019s because it was mostly about radio airplay. Artists wanted to have a hit song on the radio and on the charts, to make money, to get popular and also to promote an album that the single would be on, usually for maximum sales. Sometimes an album was simply built around a hit single. But, when radio no longer was the main focus, artists still would come out with albums. When a song on the album became really popular with fans, then it would be released as a single, again for maximum sales. That continues today and I hope it answers your question. One interesting anecdote: In my generation, The Beatles were the most popular band ever to come into being. They were very prolific songwriters. Not only did they write their own hit songs, they even wrote hit songs for other bands of the day, songs that they wouldn\u2019t even put out on their own records. And . . . they were the only band I know of that wrote many hit singles for themselves that were not even put on their albums. They just had so many songs, and they were so popular, they didn\u2019t need to have the singles on an album for it to sell, and they didn\u2019t need to build albums around a hit song. ",
