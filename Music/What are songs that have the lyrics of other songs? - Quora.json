Lyrics I exit through the spotlight glareI stepped out into thin airInto a perfume so rarefied\"Here comes the bride\" Not quite aside, they snide, \"she's number four\"\"There's number three just by the door\"Those in the know, don't even flatter her, they go one better\"She was selling speedboats in a trade show when I met her\" Look at her nowShe's starting to yawnShe looks like she was born to itBut it was so much easierWhen I was cruel She reaches out her arms to meImploring \"another melody?\"So she can dance her husband out on the floorThe captains of industry just lie there where they fall In an eau-de-nil and pale carnationA satin sash and velvet elevationShe straightens the tipsy headdress of her spouseWhile hers recalls a honey house There'll be no sorrows left to drownEarly in the morning in your evening gownBut it was so much easierWhen I was cruel The entrance hall was arranged with hostesses and ushersWho turned out to be the younger wives nursing schoolgirl crushesParting the waves of those few feint friendsFingers once offered are now too heavy to extend The ghostly first wife glides up on stage whispering to raucous talkersSpilling family secrets out to flunkies and castrato walkersSee that girlWatch that sceneDigging the \"Dancing Queen\" Two newspaper editors like playground sneaksRunning a book on which of them is going to last the weekOne of them calls to me and he says, \"I know you\"\"You gave me this tattoo back in eighty-two\"\"You were a spoilt child then with a record to plug\"\"And I was a shaven-headed seaside thug\"\"Things haven't really changed that much\"\"One of us is still getting paid too much\" There are some things I can't reportThe memory of his last retortBut it was so much easierWhen I was cruel Look at me nowShe's starting to yawnShe looks like she was born to itAh, but it was so much easierWhen I was cruel Written by Antonio Amurri, Bruno Canfora, Elvis Costello \u2022 Copyright \u00a9 Universal Music Publishing Group, Downtown Music Publishing ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat are songs that have the lyrics of other songs?\u201d I am sure that there are many that either intentionally or unintentionally plagiarize other songs, but the first one that came to mind is also a fairly good indication of my eclectic music tastes: \u201cUneasy\u201d by Laika. \u201cYou never miss the water till the well runs dry You never miss the sun till it leaves the sky Only know when it's too late to try You never love a man till he says goodbye.\u201d I was listening to this track during my 2006-07 deployment to Iraq when the realization that part of the chorus was almost exactly the same as the chorus from another song: \u201cYou Never Miss a Real Good Thing (\u2018til He Says Goodbye)\u201d by Crystal Gayle. \u201cNever see the light of day til it goes away Never want a drink of water Til the well runs dry Never miss a real good thing Til he says good-bye.\u201d (Yeah. A guy listening to these two songs during deployment. Until you have witnessed the sheer \u201cunshuffleable horror\u201d that is my iPod, you cannot understand the complexities of what I find enjoyable or my utter disdain for radio stations.) Back to the music \u2013 I found it irritating that I had been listening to Laika ever since I stumbled across one of their CD\u2019s in a Borders back in 1998 and I had never made this particular connection to a song from my childhood. What was even more bothersome was the fact that I while I recognized this similarity in lyrics, I had lost my Crystal Gayle MP3\u2019s during one of my partially-obsessive backup/duplicate purge sessions at 4am and had to either find someone who listened to her music\u2026 on FOB Speicher\u2026 (ha.) or download the album all over again. I chose the latter. ",
