            "answer_text": "A lot, actually. Not particularly K-pop. More like the whole Korean culture. I was a huge fan of K-Pop and South Korea since I was 10 years old. And stopped being a fan earlier this year. As I grow older, I learned how idealistic K-Pop world is. I remember when I was younger, my friend and I attempted to audition for a renowned agency. We were too na\u00efve. When I was younger, I could only see the bright side of K-pop, a world full of cherries and rainbows and all happy things. It provided me tremendous amount of solace, a friend like no other. I taught myself Korean, and now I am fluent in it. As time goes by, the dark sides of K-pop unravels itself. And I am glad I am no longer a part of it. It\u2019s teeming with discrimination. I know some of you might disagree. But K-pop is so full of racism and discrimination. Not gonna tell you further. Behind their seemingly kind attitude, lies their dark side that you never want to see. I see a lot of comments from K-netizens complaining about this or that idol looking Southeast Asian. I know, a lot of them underestimate southeast asians and consider themselves to be superior. Discrimination against mixed race idols? Too often. Chinese idols? Don\u2019t get me started on that one. Racism and discrimination is everywhere in this world, and you can spot a lot of it in the K-world.Aegyo culture, or the desire to look CUTE. This is plain disgusting. 30 something year olds are expected to talk in a high-pitched voice of a toddler. You know that show with Deffcon and Jung Hyungdon? Weekly Idol? UGH. I used to dig it. Now I realize how fake and annoying it is.Full of fakeness. I used to see K-pop as a world filled with unicorns and where all good things happen. I still remember back then how me and my best friend were huge fans of DBSK, Bigbang, and Kim Hyun Joong. Well, now look what kind of individuals they wound up being. What a shame.Crazy fans.Dramatic idols.Full of dramas.Immature. Can\u2019t emphasize on this one anymore. Just annoying.Promotes lookism. This is what I really hate about K-pop culture. It promotes lookism. Slight deviance from accepted social standards, then you\u2019re ugly. Asymmetric features, ugly. Can\u2019t even count how many times I\u2019ve seen comments or articles saying idol A is a natural beauty or idol B denies getting plastic surgery. Well, we have to expect them to have gotten under the knife. South Korea is the lair of plastic surgery, after all? But why are people still so salty about their idols getting plastic surgery?Pretentiousness. Those swaggalicious K-pop rappers, can\u2019t take it anymore. Those hep hap girls wearing hep happy outfits. Ha.Unoriginality. In terms of the k-pop idols\u2019 personality. Their personalities seem to be similar to one another somehow. Nearly every group has em. The cold one, the funny one, the ladylike one, the cute one. The concepts are narrowed down to sexy and cute. Now another concept : hep hap.Monotonous.Unrealistic and submissive attitude. I don\u2019t want to generalize all K-pop idols. But a lot of them behave unrealistically in the face of worldly problems.Perform, sing, act to impress not to express. Those who genuinely perform to express are marginalized or often overshadowed by \u2018good-looking\u2019 ones or the ones with\u2026 you know.Many idols can\u2019t sing and can\u2019t dance. Probably they can, but only average. Some only serve as the group\u2019s visual. 1 or 2 people, and sometimes 3\u20135 people in big groups, can sing. The rest? Probably dancers? They can move their body gracefully a little, let\u2019s call em dancers. Rappers? Yeah, they speed talk, let\u2019s call em rappers. The one who\u2019s unable to do both? Call em visual if they\u2019re pretty and variety king/queen if they\u2019re average. Not both? Well, in charge of the mom/dad of the group probably. In charge of the youngest (maknae). In charge of the cutest. Ha.Taught me that FACIAL APPEARANCE matters above anything else. Hahahaahahahaha. Don\u2019t get me started on this one. No matter how hard those idols try to look natural, still looks\u2026 bad\u2026Idols putting their fans as their priority, feeding their fans\u2019 infatuated minds.Many of you would disagree with me. I have been there. I used to be soo irked when people talked bad about my idols. But now I can see why. Kpop industry is now oversaturated. My old idol groups that I loved so much, SHINee Bigbang Ukiss Wonder Girls 2NE1 and others are no longer here. And the fans, don\u2019t get me started on that one too. I think getting into K-pop was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever taken in my life, and quitting it is also one of the best decisions I have ever taken in my life so far. ",

            "answer_text": "Everything I am going to say has probably been said before, but I don't care. I love Kpop and all, some of the music produced and idol group music video's and performances are beyond amazing and the fandoms are (Usually) fun to join as well as fun. 1. The Big Three: I don't particularly hate the idol groups produced under them but the company themselves especially one which will remain unnamed *cough cough * SM *cough cough*. I hate how they treat their idol groups at times, either by stopping them from making a comeback due to 'unpopularity' or favouring groups over others. I also hate the fact that any idol group under them instantly becomes a success. There are many other groups from other companies that are good but are overshadowed and ignored due to the popularity of The Big Three. It's not that those idol groups are bad, I feel they should start at the same position as other groups so they aren't winning rookie awards just for being part of a big company. 2. Dieting and body shaming: Let them eat chicken, like seriously when they are in variety shows and they are offered food they all get shook and look at the food as if it's a luxury. Also due to the amount of training their bodies are fit enough to not be labelled as fat by neitzens or variety show presenters. 3. Training: ACE (a new group btw) spend at least 12 hours a day training for the performance of their debut song. They told that to people in a showcase and they were all unfazed. Boy 12 hours is half the day!!!! They are overworked, it's too much and really annoying when they are forced to do that. This is what causes them to faint and be generally unwell and it's worrying. 4. Variety Show Presenters: I love variety shows but honestly at times the presenters are rude. I remember being a foetus fan and watching Weekly Idol for the first time. I was surprised they were so rude especially to Jiyoon (4Minute Weekly Idol Episode), I understood it was for entertainment purposes but at the time I was shocked at that. Also I remember Suga (BTS, you probably knew though) had made a mixtape for the show, and they completely mocked him. Another really upsetting thing was Chanyeol on Star Show 360 (EXO, fyi). he was talking about how he was emotional and of course they made fun of him. Then when they asked him when it was the last time he cried. They cut off that bit. I was super annoyed at that and still am. 5. Dating: Date who the hell you want. I don't care if you happy then I am happy. 6. SM Entertainment: They have the most law suits filled against them than Donald Trump has haters. 7. Make Up: The fact that idols don't like showing their faces without make up. They look great with and without and I don't care. I like your personality and your music the face is just a bonus. 8. Europe & Africa: We exist, you have fans here, come to us. 9. There fakeness at times: I love it when Jimin says he 'does this for ARMY' but STOP LYING BOY! Don't do stuff for us if you are being genuine, do it for yourself. Also sometimes groups act so fake at times especially when talking about sad personal stuff. They pretend to joke around, despite us knowing that things aren't always great. You don't have to pretend that everything is ok for the fans. We worry about you. We don't mind if you cry. We don't mind if you have a breakdown. We don't mind if you get angry. Tell the fans we (some of us) will understand. I love it when groups are themselves and relaxed. They don't have to put up an exaggerated act sometimes like they do at times. 10. Being refused to make their own music: Let them make music and write their own music if they want too. They are doing this more often and its great as some of their songs are great, but do it more as some of their original self-composed songs are my favourites. Let Min Suga be a genius. I love Kpop though. The dedication of artist and willingness to do well. Kpop is an intresting and inspirational genre of music due to how different and unique the musicians and artist are. ",
