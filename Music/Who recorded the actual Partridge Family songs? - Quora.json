            "answer_text": " Well I hate to disappoint anyone but the Partridge Family did not perform as a band. It was all pretend except for David Cassidy\u2019s singing and Shirley Jones at times as well. The family pretended to play instruments and the actual musical instruments were played by professional session musicians. The company that produced the show Screen Gems released a series of albums as The Partridge family but once again, David Cassidy and Shirley Jones were the only cast member\u2019s contributing. So there you have it.. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer to this question is that Screen Gems hired a bunch of studio musicians to sing for the Family. But, after the theme song, \u201cC\u2019Mon Get Happy\u201d, went to number one in the country, Screen Gems proceeded to hire a proven hit maker to write songs for them to \u201csing\u201d and record. This fellow, I forget his name, actually auditions David Cassidy and finds a quite good voice in him and from then on David records his tracks and Shirley Jones who can sing, records hers and the studio dudes and one lady do the rest. There you have it. ",
