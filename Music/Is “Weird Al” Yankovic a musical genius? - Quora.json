            "answer_text": "A2A. Yes, it's fair to say Weird Al Yankovic is indeed a musical genius. Any semi-creative person can come up with a novelty record and sell some copies of it. A really good novelty act can be milked for a year or two before people get tired of it. Weird Al released his first album in 1983 and released his most recent one in 2014. His career has spanned more than 30 years. He doesn't just do song parodies, half his discography is original material. He also does style parodies, where he will do an original song but in the distinctive style of another band. Perhaps the most famous example is his song \"Dare to be Stupid\" which was done in the style of new wave band DEVO.   How good was Al's style parody? \"In an interview on VH1's Behind the Music, Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh stated in reaction to the song that: \"I was in shock. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever heard. He sort of re-sculpted that song into something else and... I hate him for it, basically.\"From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dare_to_Be_Stupid_(song) He won a Grammy for \"Eat It\", \"Fat\", and \"Poodle Hat\" and won a Grammy for Best Comedy Album (for \"Mandatory Fun\") in 2015. He makes it all look easy when it takes a lot of hard work and he's managed to be relevant for decades. When it comes to music satirists (with the exception of the late great Stan Freberg), Weird Al Yankovic is the main name you think of. So yes... he is a musical genius. ",

            "answer_text": "The term is probably overused. Far as I know he wasn\u2019t writing symphonies at age 5 or that sort of thing. He has a certain kind of genius for pop parodies. I think you can categorize him as a unique talent. I can\u2019t think of another person who has done what he\u2019s done with his level of success at it. I would consider him more of a creative genius than a musical genius, with the understanding that he obviously understands music very well to do what he does. ",
