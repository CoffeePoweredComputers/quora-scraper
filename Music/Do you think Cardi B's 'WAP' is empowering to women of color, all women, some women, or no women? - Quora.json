            "answer_text": "I heard this song for the first time yesterday and my first question was can they even make a clean version of this song? Supposedly one exists around here. It was a catchy song but I\u2019m not sure how to feel about a song when music can be so much more meaningful then that. Are Cardi and Megan trying to be empowering with this song? Also in the video was Kylie Jenner so what about her? They knew it would all be controversial and this sells. As for if it can be empowering? That depends on your interpretation. Any woman of any race can find it empowering. Seeing two women of color rapping about sexuality could be empowering to other women of color. Not being a woman of color I can\u2019t give you an accurate picture of what they would feel. As a woman I think it\u2019s nice to see confident women and we all should be. It just doesn\u2019t have to be just about sexuality either. Education, careers, happiness, family, friendships, relationships, there\u2019s a ton of empowerment to find. Now I will say empowerment for most is not going to be like Cardi, Megan, or Kylie. These ladies were blessed with either talent or a famous family and they were able to change things they didn\u2019t like about themselves. But largely if this song helps a woman feel empowered that\u2019s a good thing! ",

            "answer_text": "In some ways, yes it is. The bawdy song is a celebration of female lust and sexuality, in an industry where such songs are almost always left to men. It\u2019s rarer for women singers to get that opportunity to be as vulgar and silly as they like, and many have to trade on having a pristine image. I\u2019m reminded of some old dirty blues songs, like Shave \u2019em Dry, by Lucille Bogan. In 1924, this was the sort of thing people were singing: I fucked all nightAnd the night before, babyAnd I feel like I wanna fuck some moreOh, grind me honeyShave me dry Ben Shapiro would have a heart attack, but I think there is such a place for this kind of music. Evidently there has always been a place for such music. ",

If a guy starting rapping about his dick and all do you think people will go; \u201cw o w what an empowering song for men.\u201d No, because no body thinks that they need empowering since they already have power. Wap is a dumb song, and tons of people love dumb songs. For some reason we have this mentality that if a women sings she must have an important message for women or focus on becoming a \u201cRole Model.\u201d Critics look into it too seriously. ",
