            "answer_text": "BTS I think they have reached their peak in popularity (I mean how much far can they go?). If they enlist in the miltary, I assume the maknae line will pursue solo careers (at least Jungkook) or they might all enlist at the same time and make a huge pro-military comeback\u2026 Kpop buzz will die down a lot. BLACKPINK They will probably go on tour promoting their new album and then take another long break.. Their popularity will remain. Most probably they would pursue solo careers as well. Hopefully they will release more meaningful songs and explore new genres and take some creative control. TWICE I think they would die out. They are past their heyday. If there isn't any problems or other endeavors amongst members or with their company (which might lead to some leaving the group) they'll continue releasing the kind of music they do but I don't think they would remain as popular. EXO They would have a much awaited comeback after all of them return from the military (which will be a long time). In the meantime I think they will continue solo work (namely Baekhyun, Chanyeol, Sehun etc.) but I don't know I just have a feeling EXO might break up or some members might prefer pursuing solo careers instead of remaining in the group. They have also passed their heyday but I expect alot from them. BIGBANG I suppose they will comeback in December or some time during BTS's military service (when they're inactive). Musically speaking, they are the top notch group and their comeback will be huge. I think the best option for them is to release music in the US (whilst BTS is inactive) and redeem their popularity. They always attract eyes whatever they do. G-Dragon and Taeyang will release solo albums and many successful collabs. Huge expectations. Treasure Tbh I don't get the classic YG vibe from them at all. So many members man! YG always went for less members who stand out individually. Anyways, they have many talented composers within the group so unless they release some hit songs, they will come and go with very little attention. This debut was underwhelming for me though, clearly showing the generic Kpop sound nowadays and not having the YG formula. MAMAMOO will remain as relevant as they are and continue to release and will become more popular in the west. Stray Kids are popular. I'm a 2nd Generation fan and really haven't followed them alot. Judging from their reputation, they will continue what they're doing now but I don't think they will have a popularity boost (not more than what they have now). Generally, more Kpop groups in the future will target the western audience (a shame really). Many english songs would be released and international collabs would take place. I hope Kpop doesn't continue this generic, party-ish, over produced sound and will focus more on Asia. Also, I think more Kpop idols will have more creative control over their music and hopefully, more meaningful mellow songs with more variety and less showmanship will be released. ",

            "answer_text": "BTS: I think they will start slowing down on group activities and I also think they will hit their peak in Success and popularity. When an artist reaches their peak in success and popularity its, not at a bad thing, there success just starts to stabilize, and as an artist, that's what your work. Also, this is just my opinion, but I think they will have to serve in the military which will slow down their promotions as a group.  Black Pink: well, if the Ceo keeps spoiling is with blackpink content I truly believe that they will become even more successful. The thing is, blackpink has so much potential so if they are promoted properly, I see them only getting bigger and more content coming our way. Ever since the new CEO, I've had a gut feeling that things are going to change for Blackpink and I mean, for the better.  Twice: their contracts expire in 2022, and I'm not sure if they are going to renew them, and at the end of the day that fine because they have already given us so many golden years, and if they don't renew their contracts they will have a chance to rest. Plus, the members will be near the age of 30, and by that time, they might want to get married or just take some time out of the spotlight as they have been in the limelight since 2015.  Girls Generation: I have a gut feeling they are planning a group comeback. I'm not saying they will get back together long term, I think we will get a comeback and album, and after a while, they'll go separate ways. I mean, girls generation have already given us 10 magical years so I'm extremely grateful to  them.  Big Bang: I know that my boys are planning a big group comeback, the question is, when? Their group comeback will be huge and it will be in America, I have that feeling because they are pretty hated in Korea plus T.O.P. Said, He would that he never wants to perform in Korea again, and I don't blame him. Idols are not perfect, they are going to make mistakes, and as fans, we have to accept that as that's what true fans do.  Atteez: They will grow bigger in Korea and internationally. I mean, the talent they possess is unreal. When I listened to wonderland for the first time, I did not think they were a rookie group. They seemed like a veteran group.  Itzy: they will grow even bigger in Korea as if twice doesn't renew their contracts onces will turn to itzy to support them not in a malicious way but a generous way as twice support itzy.  Txt: They will get bigger in America, I just have that feeling about them, and I've listened to their music, and it's solid. Also, they are BTS\u2019s Brother group so when BTS slow down activities as a group or go on a well-deserved break a lot of fans will turn to TXT. In Korea, they will also, get bigger.  Nct: By this time, some of the members will start enlisting in the military, as taeyong is 25 and five years from now he will be 30. And the military enlistment age is between the ages of 18 and 28. Johnny's also 25. Honestly, a lot of the members are the at the age where they can enlist if they want.     ",
