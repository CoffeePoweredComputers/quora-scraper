            "answer_text": "I am afraid this might not be true. I doubt the authenticity of this comment, but even if it is true then I don\u2019t think he meant it literally. Here is one of my answers, Chris Austin's answer to Who did Jimi Hendrix say was the best guitarist in the world? There I discussed that Jimi Hendrix not only pointed Rory Gallagher (even if he did) but also many other guitarists to be superior to him. The reason is that Hendrix wasn\u2019t like Yngwie, Ritchie or other egoistic guitarists. He was pretty nice and humble. That\u2019s why he often told them being superior to him. Now, back to the original question. Was he better than Hendrix? I am afraid I am going to have to say no. What I have already discussed here, Chris Austin's answer to What qualities made Rory Gallagher such a highly regarded guitarist? Are there specific tracks that showcase these qualities? And for the fact is that, I might be one of the biggest fans of Rory Gallagher on quora. Anybody who will say Rory Gallagher is a better guitarist than Jimi Hendrix, Ritchie Blackmore or Robert Fripp is most likely being attracted to Rory Gallagher. And I don\u2019t mean sexually. Rory Gallagher had a very good performing style which attracts a lot of fans. The qualities which I hadn\u2019t seen in Eric Clapton, David Gilmour, Mark Knopfler or many great other guitarists. Again, I am diverting from the original answer. Jimi Hendrix was a guy who did more things on his guitar. He was a man better on his effects and pedals, a better tremolo/whammy player, more efficient scaling, better handier when it comes to picking. While Rory on the other hand, pretty different techniques. Which might be in the mainstream guitar playing, but not influential like Hendrix. For instance, I don\u2019t remember Rory doing dive bombs or wah pedals like Hendrix. So, Hendrix undoubtedly was a better guitarist than Rory. But why people are so much attracted to Rory? As I already said, its because of his performance. Rory was a better musician than Hendrix. Everything of Rory Gallagher attracts his fans. From his lifestyle to his music playing. For instance the song A Million Miles Away, \u201cThis hotel bar has lost all its people,The piano man has caught the last bus home,The old bartender just collapsed in the corner,Why I'm still here, I just don't know,I don't know. I'm a million miles away,A million miles away,I'm sailing like a driftwood on a windy bay,On a windy bay.\u201d Here Rory is directly or indirectly describing himself. As most of his biography goes, Rory Gallagher was mostly a lonely person. Remember this song was written in 1973. Much before he became an Alcoholic. He is describing himself as a person who is more attached to music than anything else. \u201cThe Piano man has caught the last bus home.\u201d The piano man who plays music all his day in a bar gets away. But Rory is there. So, like I already said. No one passion like Rory Gallagher. Rory Gallagher never sold himself. In the \u201980s MTV time Rory was there playing among people where even people like Dio or Mark Knopfler signed with MTV. Besides, Rory Gallagher was a very good live performer. (Actually this is the main reason people love him). He had tremendous jamming skills. Except for his older days he played some great boosting sounds in 1980s. He was a great acoustic player,  On the other hand, Hendrix was mostly an electric guitar player. In fact there are only two known videos of Hendrix playing acoustic guitar. Rory was also a better multi-instrumentalist. He was a damn good saxophonist.  So, clearly as a multi-instrumentalist Rory was better. But I am afraid not might be in the case of guitar. Thanks for the a2a :) ",

            "answer_text": "there were a few guitarists who were remarkable, with extra ordinary abilities on guitar\u2026and rory gallagher was one of them\u2026.however, guitar playing is somewhat subjective also\u2026hendrix had a lot of flash, tremendous speed and skill also\u2026but amongst the greats were peter green, eric claption, j page , jeff beck\u2026also hendrix commented on phil keaggy also\u2026these somewhat unknown in mainstream,phil keaggy and gallagher were remarkable also, and it may be, if you watch them closely, they may have done one or two things a bit better than hendrix, with their skills and sounds, or style, and perhaps thats what he meant. because they did have remarkable skills and were adept of which , not many mentioned, ie they were more guitarist , guitarists\u2026if you check phil keaggy on a song such as time, here\u2026i think he is an equal, by my opinion\u2026jus that he s not well known, ie mainstream  i even prefer his playing actually, hendrix was a little to wild for me at times. and of course gallager was quite skilled, out of all of the great guitarist, to be honest, i prefer peter green, and phil keaggy over hendrix. i think hendrix was more power and show, than pure skill\u2026yet highly skilled etc.. here is gallager, and he played in a fast, flashy way, at an early time too, like even say i think , 1966. when hendrix was\u2026this clip, though, i think in the seventies\u2026  where peter green, it was more about a mood he created, and a great feel. i think he was the best, in my opinion\u2026it wasn t about speed or flash\u2026  to be honest and to sum up, in the sixties and early seventies, there were a number of simply brilliant guitarists. and i think it is up to ones own opinion\u2026.hendrix was innovative, showy, fast, had his own brilliance. but to be honest, i get tired of that\u2026like i said, peter green does it for me, and also when he was in fleetwood mac. also, i love clapton when in the yardbyrds and, cream etc\u2026i also heard some of greg allmond jams, with clapton, i was highly impressed. with some of these players, it was more feel, than perhaps flash or speed or skills that hendrix seemed to portray. i think hendrix stood out the most, and started some of that distortion,flash first or one of the first\u2026remember, there was cream. clapton was i think amazed at hendrix, but i think clapton had such a great feel, with power\u2026hendrix , had some great moments, but sometimes he was too over the top for me\u2026.i ve heard some blues also by jimmy page, from the mid sixties, and i was also very impressed. if you hear also some jeff beck stuff, he was quite inventive, and had a great feel also\u2026i note his version of day and a life, he had a sublty\u2026.i ve heard some blues , rock also by others i was very impresed with. but hendrix had tons of power, skill and sort of blew everyone away\u2026 ",
