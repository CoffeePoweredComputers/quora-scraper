            "answer_text": "Based on the research I have done, there are no such websites. If you want notation of songs, ask your music teacher. He can help you write it down. Anyone who practices classical music and understands notes will be able to help. Why don't you do one thing? Start practising alankars and dedicate with honesty an hour each morning and evening for just two months. As soon as your mind develops the sense of musical notes, you will be able to do the notation yourself very easily. For the time being, I can help you with notations. Just leave the name of any song of your choice in the comments section and I will do it for you. Thank you. ",
