            "answer_text": "In no Muslim country, including Saudi Arabia, Music is banned. This issue is very old and was resolved long time ago. Imam al-Ghazzali, one of the most famous Muslim scholars, writing almost a thousand years ago, reported several Ahadith and came to the following conclusion: \u201cAll these Ahadith are reported by al-Bukhari and singing and playing are not haram.\u201d Al-Ghazzali also convincingly answered many critics who had raised such objections in his book, \u201cIhya Ulum al-Deen.\u201d Those who are opposed to music, quote this Hadith:  \u201cBukhari, Volume 7, Book 69, Number 494v: Narrated Abu \u2018Amir or Abu Malik Al-Ash\u2019ari: that he heard the Prophet saying, \u201cFrom among my followers there will be some people who will consider illegal sexual intercourse, the wearing of silk, the drinking of alcoholic drinks and the use of musical instruments, as lawful. And there will be some people who will stay near the side of a mountain and in the evening their shepherd will come to them with their sheep and ask them for something, but they will say to him, \u2018Return to us tomorrow.\u2019 Allah will destroy them during the night and will let the mountain fall on them, and He will transform the rest of them into monkeys and pigs and they will remain so till the Day of Resurrection.\u201d It is dangerous to form an opinion on the basis of one or two Hadiths, and Hadith literature should be considered as raw data. Each Hadith should be evaluated and compared with other Ahadith as well as with other historical sources. The problem is that we usually don\u2019t know the context of each Hadith, and it is difficult to know under what circumstances the Prophet (s.a.w) made certain statements. The above Hadith most likely refers to musical instruments used in drinking parties during the period of \u201cjahiliyaa\u201d (pre-Islamic era) in which even men wore silk clothes and orgies included illegal sexual intercourse. Taken by itself, the Hadith should also ban silk, but that is not the case and silk is permitted for women. That is why it is important to look at all Ahadith and not come to a hasty conclusion. There are other Ahadiths which clearly show that musical instruments are permitted: For example this Hadith: \u201cVolume 6, Book 61, Number 568: Narrated Abu Musa: That the Prophet said to him\u2019 \u2018O Abu Musa! You have been given one of the musical wind-instruments of the family of David .\u2019\u201d  Critics also argue that music instruments are ONLY allowed during festivities. They quote this Hadith: Bukhari, Volume 2, Book 15, Number 72: Narrated Aisha: Abu Bakr came to my house while two small Ansari girls were singing beside me the stories of the Ansar concerning the Day of Buath. And they were not singers. Abu Bakr said protestingly, \u201cMusical instruments of Satan in the house of Allah\u2019s Apostle !\u201d It happened on the \u2018Id day and Allah\u2019s Apostle said, \u201cO Abu Bakr! There is an \u2018Id for every nation and this is our \u2018Id.\u201d That Hadith again has to be studied in proper context because the Prophet (pbuh) not only permitted singing on other occasions, he recommended it. \u201cAishah narrated that when her relative was married to an Ansari man, the Prophet (s.a.w) said: \u2018Aishah, did they have any entertainment? The Ansar are fond of Entertainment.\u201d He didn\u2019t say they were fond of entertainment only on festivities or that it was wrong but allowed on some occasions. In another Hadith, \u201cIbn Abbas said, \u2018Aishah gave a girl relative of hers in marriage to a man of the Ansar. The Prophet (s.a.w) came and asked, \u2018Did you send a singer along with her?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 she said. The Messenger of Allah then said: \u2018The Ansar are a people who love poetry. You should have sent along someone who would sing, \u2018here we come, to you we come, greet us as we greet you.'\u201d Music-haters also reference this Hadith: \u201cAnas ibn Malik related from the Prophet (saws) that, \u201ctwo cursed sounds are that of the musical instrument(mizmaar) played on the occasion of joy and grace, and the woeful wailing upon the occasion of adversity.\u201d It is not difficult to find contradictory Ahadith. However, almost all scholars of Islam are of the view that singing is not only permitted, it is recommended on the occasions of Eid, weddings, births, aqiqahs, and on the return of a traveler. {See Yusuf al-Qardawi\u2019s \u201cThe Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam.\u201d] Qardawi in the same book also states the following: \u201cIt is reported that many Companions of the Prophet (may Allah be pleased with them) as well as second generation Muslim scholars used to listen to singing and did not see anything wrong with it. As for the Ahadith which have been reported against singing, they all are weak and have been shown by researchers to be unsound. The jurist Abu Bakr al-Arabi says, \u2018No sound Hadith is available concerning the prohibition of singing,\u2019 while Ibn Hazm says, \u2018 All that is reported on this subject is false and fabricated\u2026he who listens to singing intending neither obedience nor disobedience in doing something neutral and harmless, which is similar to going to the park and walking around, standing by a window and looking at the sky, wearing blue or green clothes, and so on.'\u201d The best answer was given by Ibn Hazm who quoted another verse: \u201cAnd what is beyond the truth except error?\u201d (Quran 10:32). In other words, those who are prohibiting something which God has not forbidden, for no apparent reason, are simply falling into error. Then there are some Muslims who argue that only drums are allowed. That too is false. Note the Hadith that I have quoted above: \u201cNarrated Abu Musa: \u201cThat the Prophet said to him \u2018O Abu Musa! You have been given one of the musical wind-instruments of the family of David.'\u201d That makes it obvious that Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w) was not opposed to wind instruments. So there goes your \u201cdrums are OK\u201d theory. Secondly, what is permitted on Eid day is also permitted on other days. There is not a single Hadith which says that what is permitted for Eid is not acceptable on other days. Muslims have been enjoying Music since the beginning of Islam with no guilt whatsoever. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Music is not prohibited or Haram. The argument that Music is haram stems from a hadith found in Bukhari which says: \u201cFrom among my followers there will be people who will consider illegal sexual intercourse, the wearing of silk, the drinking of alcoholic drinks, and the use of musical instruments as lawful\u201d. This would lead us to believe that all music is haram. Yet we also read in Bukhari the following: Narrated Aisha: \u201cAbu Bakr came to my hourse while two small Ansari girls were singing beside me the stories of the Ansar concerning the day of Buath. And they were not singers. Abu Bakr said protestingly, \u201cMusical instruments of Satan in the house of Allah\u2019s Apostle!\u201d It happened on the Id day and Allah\u2019s Apostle said \u201cO Abu Bakr! There is an Id for every nation and this is our Id\u201d. Narrated Urwa on the authority of Aisha: On the days of Mina, Abu Bakr came to her while two young girls were beating the duff and the Prophet was lying covered with his clothes. Abu Bakr scolded them and the Prophet uncovered his face and said to Abu Bakr, \u201cLeave them, for these days are the days of Id and the days of Mina. \u201c So some scholars (not the Prophet) have interpreted that musical instruments are haram because of the hadith that says that the use of musical instruments are illegal. Yet we find that the duff is being used in the presence of the Prophet as music. So there is a contradiction. Therefore, to address this contradiction, scholars say the duff was allowed because it was not a musical instrument. Others say it is allowed but only during Islamic events, such as the Id. None of these answers are accurate because the Prophet just stated in one narration that musical instruments are haram. How can you now say the duff is allowed or permissible only in Islamic festivities? That is a contradiction. Additionally, there is also no logical basis to ban all instruments except the duff or drum. We can also dig further and see that the authenticity of this hadith in Bukhari is not reliable. This does not mean that the collection of hadiths in Bukhari are not the most reliable but as we will see, Bukhari himself did not include this hadith in his authentic collection. Bukhari would include a title for an authentic hadith, then under it lists the authentic hadith. The titles would include some of his fiqh and also another hadith that was not on the same level as his authentic hadith. This was done to bring clarification to the authentic hadiths listed below it. So the hadith about music was a title by Bukhari and he did not put it in his authentic collection. According to Imam al-Muhallab, the reason is because the narrator Hisham was not sure of the name of the companion. Therefore, Bukhari did not include it. Yet some scholars found another connected chain for this type of hadith according to Ibn Hajr. Therefore, they deemed that the hadith is authentic themselves, but Bukhari never did so. Yet this does not resolve the issue because some prominent scholars still have a problem with Hisham as a reliable narrator. They include Imam al-Thahabi, Imam Ahmad, and Abu Dawud. Ibn Hazm and other scholars go further and say that all hadith that claim that singing is haram are false and agrees that singing is permissible as long as it does not include indecency. So we have scholastic evidence that the hadith in Bukhari is not authentic and there is no logical rebuttal to the argument to show otherwise. We also see that even if we accept the hadith, it contradicts other hadith when trying to enforce that musical instruments are haram, and any reason one can make to accept only the duff or certain instruments are halal. Therefore those who rely on the authority of the hadith in Bukhari as proof that music or musical instruments are haram have no logical basis since the evidence that the hadith is authentic or reliable is not sound. The correct position is that Music is halal, as long as it does not promote indecency. ",
