            "answer_text": "Elvis\u2019 record collection at Graceland was beyond impressive. Elvis would listen to many different artists, and with that being said, he probably liked A LOT of songs. I know for a fact that Elvis once really loved Tom Jones\u2019 \u201cGreen, Green Grass of Home\u201d. There\u2019s actually a neat little story behind him liking that song. Elvis was traveling home to Memphis after his latest film Spinout had just been released. Just outside of Little Rock, they were able to pickup signal for WHBQ, a radio station where Elvis\u2019 friend George Klein was a DJ. George was playing the country tearjerker \u201cGreen, Green Grass of Home\u201d and after hearing it once, Elvis stopped his bus and told one of his guys to call in to the station as ask George to play the song again. This repeated until Elvis arrived in Memphis. Elvis and his guys got a good laugh out of this except for Red West, one of Elvis\u2019 closest friends, because Red had suggested the song to Elvis a year earlier, but Elvis had then said that song was \u201cfar too country\u201d for him to even consider recording \u2014 he obviously changed his mind on that front:  I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a few more stories not coming to mind right now, but that\u2019s the first one I thought of. Here is an article from the Graceland website that gives a great insight to Elvis\u2019 massive record collection: Inside Elvis\u2019 Record Collection Hope I helped! ",

Since I have a partial inventory from 1956\u201357, 1964\u201365, and then the entire inventory from 1977 here are a few that stand out that Elvis fans might not be aware of (note this denotes which version he loved and in some cases is also the author as well) Be my love (Mario Lanza) I saw the light (Hank Williams) Green green grass of home (Tom Jones) I don\u2019t care what the world may do (Blackwood Brothers) A thing called love (Jerry Reed) Will you still love me tomorrow (Carole King) Well, I gotta go.
