            "answer_text": "As always, pop had the biggest audience, but there was an increasing interest in the emerging sound of rock and blues-rock. In the early 60\u2019s the light pop sound of the 50\u2019s still drove the top of the singles charts. But by the mid-60\u2019s the first British invasion had taken hold and the Beatles were dominant followed closely by the Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks, and others. On the American front, the Motown sound had broken out along with early psychedelic bands like Jefferson Airplane. What was important was the slowly growing divide between top 40 pop (and radio stations devoted to it) and more serious rock stations that grew from campus radio to full-fledged commercial stations and later album-oriented rock stations.

            "answer_text": "Interesting question. Since music wasn\u2019t as accessible back in the day - You had limited access to music and varying styles. So you\u2019d probably listen to whatever was on the radio. We are fortunate enough to have access to many decades and genres of music at our fingertips making everybody think they are dj\u2019s and not accepting of others tastes. ",
