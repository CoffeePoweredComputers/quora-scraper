            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not going to be sarcastic about this. I think people in general that do this are struggling to explain themselves convincingly with words. What I mean is there are multiple possibilities as to the \u2018why\u2019 of it. It\u2019s not embellishing emphasis, for example how Italians are stereotyped for gesturing while talking if they are passionate about something. In the case of accordion hands, the motion is not really helping to describe a shape or a concept; no matter who was doing it. In Trump\u2019s case, it\u2019s like he\u2019s flailing to make his point and it comes across exhibiting some frustration. The motions get wider the more he\u2019s challenged and he hates that. Notice when he steps back from a lectern, he often twists side to side and gazes out at the room or his eyes get droopy. He\u2019s not the center of attention for that time and that drives him to distraction. Anyway, to me it\u2019s a distraction/frustration motion he\u2019s come up with and it has become automatic now. On the other side there is Nancy Pelosi who\u2019s been called out for her \u201cjazz hands\u201d and she does frequently use one hand or the other to gesture but it\u2019s more subtle than pumping your arms in and out and in and out and in and out on the squeezebox all night.

He moves his hands thinking it emphasizes what he is saying like it is important and possible show his words mean action. Nothing can be further from the truth as far as I\u2019m concerned. I don\u2019t listen to him. The CORONA-19 virus is dangerous and has been ever since we heard of it existing. Something like this could happen at any time and we should always have plans and manning to contend with outbreaks. People should understand the gravity of the situation and not be jerked around by a president trying to make it not seem as bad as it is just to keep popularity points. or possibly he is just that stupid, either way he is unfit to serve.
