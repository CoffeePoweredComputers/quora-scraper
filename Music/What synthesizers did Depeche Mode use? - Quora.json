            "answer_text": "Depeche Mode have been making synthesizer based music for 40 years. This question is not easy to answer. The question also has two parts. Synth bands will use different synthesizers in the studio to those which they use on stage. Depeche mode\u2019s stage synth set up is easy to find out a quick google search will give you lists for each tour. The only notable thing to say here is that from 1983 through to 1998, They mostly used the EMU Emulator (and E-MAX) range of keyboards. In terms of sound, the first album is almost entirely made from ARP 2600 patches layered up, with some Yamaha, Moog, etc\u2026 By their third album the EMU Emulator becomes very prominent. For the fourth and fifth albums, the NED Synclavier is the lead synth (Some great Reward and Black Celebration, are really that synth). From their sixth album, the range of sound sources become too large to nail down, only notable synth is the use of the Roland Modular on the Violator and Song of Faith and Devotion Albums. For more recent albums, Martin Gore has said that he\u2019s really into Eurorack Modular.

In websites such as Vintagesynth you'll find Depeche Mode listed among the users of virtually every synth ever. One that has been following them from the very start, however, is their Arp 2600. On their first two albums, it was their main synth, but apparently it is present in s\u00f8me form on every album they ever msde ",
