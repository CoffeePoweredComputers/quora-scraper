            "answer_text": "Love what you do and do what you loveThat's the chorus of \"Jazzy Jeff - for da luv of the game\"(you may not like hip-hop, I recommend you to check it out) Lyricshttp://www.metrolyrics.com/for-da-love-of-da-game-lyrics-dj-jazzy-jeff.html I believe it really summarises what you need to in life/music  I also choose happiness and my passion is music but you have to catch up on your dreams if you aren't there yet. WHAT IS YOUR FIELD?The music world may seem 'small' to you but the field is quite massive, and lots of stuff to do and where you can work in. So your job is the figure out where you want to go. Here is just a small selection what you can choose from;  Music producer Sound engineer at concerts, small to large music venue, theatres, festivalsRecording engineerMixing engineerSong writerCreating music for adverts, tv show, moviesEvent promoter/organiser; Small venue to festivalLabel ownerMusic instrument maker; do you love building things? making instruments? or do you program virtual instruments/plugins?Acoustic guitars, Steinways piano's, Violins are still hand made. I also love discovering new amazing plugins or virtual instruments and there is always room for more! And when was the last time a totally new revolutionary music instrument created? I think it's time for one, well I would love to see one in my life time :) EDIT: I love the computer! It's one of the best things to create music on! ConductorComposer OrchestratorMusic publisherMusic Royalty CollectionMusician (i.e. session or concert)Music therapyMusic teaching; I really appriciate teachers, I had some amazing teachers who really loved teaching music technology and were excited about it. It really made a difference!Be an inventor! We love new instruments or gadgetsEquipment or instrument restorer/maintanence/tuning; thing always breaks down. Are you good at fixing music instruments, microphones, mixing desks?Radio; Yes, the radio stations are still around (and is evolving at the mo) You could be a programmeur/producer/engineer/host/not just a DJArtist managementArtist agentMusic pluggerMusic attorneyEquipment hire companyEquipment sellingMusic magazine; Owner/journalist/writer/bloggerThe above is still a small list and I haven't covered everyhing and I have only experience in the \"Western\"-world.  Once you find something in the above list then you can narrow it to the genre's, and you know the genre choice is huuuge.  (I know, no one like to be pigeonholed, but I'm just saying what the options that are out there). So look at the above list and see where you could fit in and if you can't find it then create it. That is the beauty of the art of music. MOVIES AND THEATREDon't forget these area's, they are always looking for music. FOCUSReally focus on the thing that you want to do and become really good at it. COLLABORATEHang out and collaborate with the people that are creating the same thing that you like. You can work with any one across the globe today! :) PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICEHow is your music theory?Do you play an instrument then play play play...Do you sing, do you practice?Do you write? What is your vocabulary?Do you know the necessary equipment that you need to use in your field that you like?If you like music marketing? Do you know the right people?Do you like dj-ing? What are the songs that really work in the style that you like? Hone your craft and look how you can improve your technique whatever it may be. BUILD AN AUDIENCEAll music needs to be heard, so build the audience and get the music out there. Unless you want to keep the music on your shelves, notebooks or harddrives for historians to discover. MENTOR/COACHIt's always handy to have a coach. Think of athletes; they all have coaches. And most importantly, you need to have someone at your side that you can trust in your musical journey. THE BIZThis is old video however you can find some really insightfull information.    EDUCATEAlways educate yourself, there are important fundamentals that you need to know and always new things developing.  Study your hero's and learn what they've done. ( Yes, I know I know... you need create you own thing... ) I also recommend to study these bookshttp://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0753555700?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=ox_sc_sfl_title_10&smid=AHRB2OK2Q2YCL http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0240522354?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=ox_sc_sfl_title_8&smid=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE  Don't wait for 'happiness, lady luck or happiness' to knock on your door. You can apply 'dreaming/hoping' when you are listening to or writing songs/lyrics. MAKE IT HAPPENCreate a plan and always fine tune it. Keep on moving, create, work, collaborate on whatever you like in music. How cheesy it may sound, you need find out you really love and focus on that to excel to the higher levels in music. All the best! See you on the otherside. E.T. ",
