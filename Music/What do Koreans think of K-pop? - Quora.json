            "answer_text": "I think each generation has its own pop-hero/heroine who never to be negotiable. Still, many middle-aged South Korean people remember (or recall) that American pop-culture dominated all over the Asian pop industry until the 1990s. They love to listen to Rock music, Progressive, Alternative, Euro Dance by the Western pop stars. When they were young, the pop culture of Korea so much poor situation that it could not be comparable to the USA or Japan. So, I understand why they had been so much enthusiastic about foreign culture. It is regarded that the middle of the 1990s was the real beginning of the K-pop culture to be compatible with English pop-culture. After that, much younger generation just started to listen to domestic pop music, which substituted foreign music. And during the 2000s, Kpop fans began to increase rapidly and then started to be exported to other Asian countries. The main point that I mean is Korean music audience is not a monolithic market composition to be generalized simply. There have been lots of segmentation which had been influenced by the social-economic environment that Koreans had involved. Over 70 years old persons still prefer traditional sad songs sharing lots of emotions with Japan, and over 50 years old people respect USA pop culture, and then 40 years old people had special memories about J-pop, Hongkong-pop, and Euro Dance-pop. Definitely, Korean younger generations overwhelmingly love to listen to K-pop music as similar to other Asian young generations. All Korean people do not like K-pop as if all Korean do not love kimchi. ",

            "answer_text": "I do not listen to K-pop songs. There are many South Koreans who do not listen to it. Some of us hate it and call it \u2018Gay pop\u2019. Meanwhile, I think K-pop has made South Korea very popular among the millennials in the World. In 1990s, South Korea was not that popular country compared to China or Japan. But now the situation is different. Because of K-pop, many foreigners visit South Korea. This increases South Korean people\u2019s income and makes its economy better. ",
