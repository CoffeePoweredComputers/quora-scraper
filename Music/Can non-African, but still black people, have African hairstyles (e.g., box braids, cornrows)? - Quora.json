            "answer_text": "Braids aren\u2019t only an African or African American hairstyle. Braids are an important part of many cultures, certainly including African and African American cultures and style, but others, too. What is next, telling non-French women not to wear a French twist? And who gets to decide who is French and who is not French? This argument is a bit odd, especially because Jamaican Americans are also part of the larger community of Black American society. Surely, there are more important and pressing issues to discuss in regards to equality and human rights. Also, culture is inherently fluid and variable and that is neither bad nor inherently sinister - it\u2019s how human minds (and free trade, and societies) operate. The reality of the human condition is fluid and complex and often changing. Sometimes it\u2019s a positive to embrace that. Where I live, in the West Side of Manhattan, contemporary Japanese hairstyles are quite popular. Japanese Americans don\u2019t seem to find it particularly offensive. There might be separate issues with regards to imitating hair or clothing items or styles with a very specific religious meaning. But that is a separate discussion. Generally, hairstyles are a) not subject to any kind of intellectual property claim and b) not really the most pressing human rights issue or moral conversation of our day. Guys\u2026(and ladies)\u2026let\u2019s remember this: it\u2019s just a hairstyle. Revel in the diversity and beauty of style. Don\u2019t mindlessly attack or try to repress it. That\u2019s what makes culture - and quite possibly more important, human society on the whole - so exciting and beautiful for us all. So if you respect diversity, respect aesthetic choice too and honor its complexity and richness rather than maligning specific choices solely for reasons of political correctness. Human identity - all our identities - are more confident, more complex, indeed, often more courageous than that. And we could all use some courage and imagination - now more than ever. ",

            "answer_text": "You\u2019re going to be hard pressed to find very many Africans who care. In all my years of living in Africa or talking to Africans, I almost never encountered anyone who was offended. Usually, when we see a foreigner wearing our clothing or sporting our hairstyles, the emotion we feel is a mixture of amusement and flattery. Take a look at this:  This picture is hilarious to me. I can\u2019t even explain why. There is something intensely incongruous about it. Or take a look at this:  It\u2019s a white guy playing the kora, a West African string instrument. How do I feel? Impressed. It sounds like a master is playing!Inadequate and somewhat ashamed: how is it that this foreigner can play our instrument and I, a dull a muddy-mettled rascal, peak like a John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my culture, and can play nothing! What? Sorry, I got carried away again. This dude seems more connected to my culture than I am. It makes me feel uprooted, a Westerner with a veneer of Africanity who has a French accent whenever he tries to speak his African mother tongue. If I have any anger in me, it is at myself that it is directed.Thankful that this man has devoted his time to becoming an ambassador of my culture.But something like this?  It doesn\u2019t even register that I should associate this hairstyle with Africa. It\u2019s her hair, not mine. It goes without saying that all this is even less noticeable when the person is a non-African black person. ",

Box braids and cornrows have been used by African-Americans for centuries, such as for mapping Underground Railroad routes, general aesthetic purposes, and self-empowerment. Black people have the right to use cultural products of Black people, it\u2019s not cultural appropriation to use those hairstyles and cultural artifacts, since it is YOUR culture and YOUR heritage involved here. So, partake in African/Black hairstyles as much as you want, it\u2019s your Black hair, it\u2019s your business. ",

In 2017 things changed and your hairstyle had to serve a higher purpose:  Now, in 2020 things could go both ways. Maintaining the current politics on hair styles\u2026  or limiting African hairstyles to those employed in the construction industry\u2026  Some voices say you are allowed to have African hairstyles if you are really sincere\u2026  Other say we are almost out of hairstyles and you have to rush to get one:  Conclusion. If you live in the USA and have hair, times are really troubling. It would be best to go for bald or emigrate to Canada. ",
