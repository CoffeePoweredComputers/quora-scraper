            "answer_text": "Don't think of arpeggios as in separate, if you want to use it for shredding, then incorporate the arpeggios into scale practice.  The easiest approach is that:You must learn all the arpeggio shapes that corresponds to different chord voicing. After that you might be familiar with the pentatonic, so for eg. the first shape (pattern) has a chord that has its root on the 6th string, play along this arpeggio while scale improvisation. And the 3rd shape (pattern) of pentatonic has its root on the 5th string, play along this and the rest of the arpeggio shapes when improvising. This is how you can really incorporate it without getting clumsy!Edit: now if you can perform it with penta, you can do it with any of the scales. ",

            "answer_text": "The best way would be to start with a chord sequence and play the same sequence as arpeggios. And then perhaps try modifying each of those chords by holding it differently or maybe hitting an extra string or note here and there. Random experimentation is the key. And as long as it sounds pleasing to the ears, it is all that matters. Here's an example you might like:  ",
