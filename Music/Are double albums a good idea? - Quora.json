            "answer_text": "It depends upon the band producing the album. Do they have enough quality material the justify a double album? An album I believe has insufficient material is \u201cThe Wall\u201d by Pink Floyd. This album would have been spectacular had it been a single album. It just suffers so horribly being drawn out and going on and on and on. An example of a great double is \u201cLive At The Fillmore East\u201d by the Allman Brothers. This is a live album. Live albums often are a good idea if a band has been around long enough and their material overall is good. A few examples: \u201cLive Dates\u201d by Wishbone Ash, Peter Frampton\u2019s famous live album, which put him on every Classic Rock station forever. \u201cGoodbye Yellow Brick Road\u201d by Elton John is a great double. He and Bernie Taupin were at the top of their writing and took the time to produce great songs before going into the studio. The Beatles \u201cWhite\u201d album is an example of ideas being laid down and given to the people. It was an experiment, but produced a number of good tunes. It would have been a stellar album if it were a single disc. Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cPhysical Graffiti\u201d was a so-so effort, which would have been great as a single disc. Too often, bands will create a double album in the studio without understanding the daunting task of producing 18-24 songs that warrant being recorded and given to the people. That is a lot of music, particularly when you consider that to get those tunes, you are going to be writing considerably more than the 18-24 tunes just to get to those which will be on the album As a song writer myself, writing that many songs in a year that are of sufficient quality to give to the public is a Herculean task. I don\u2019t write that many whole songs in a year. I write maybe 10. But I do write ideas by the dozens. If bands plan in advance for a double album, they can produce sufficient quality music to make it worthwhile. But they have to understand it means rejecting a lot of songs in the process to get to the songs that warrant recording. So, yes, double albums are a good idea if the people producing one realise they are going to have to really work harder than is required for a single disc to make it of sufficient quality overall, with few \u201cthrow away\u201d cuts. That\u2019s a very difficult task, even for the best song writing bands and artists. ",

            "answer_text": "Almost never. There have only been a handful of truly great ones. Most have s lot of filler and were made because of ego or to let different members of the band contribute ( ie, TheWhite Album). I\u2019ll list two of my favorites: Yellow Brick Road by Elton John. 1973. Scarcely a bad track, multiple hits, iconic in every way. Live at Fillmore East by The Allman Brothers Band. 1971. Quite possibly the best live album ever. Recorded just shortly before Duane\u2019s death. If there is better twin guitar work, I haven\u2019t heard it. Still sounds innovative and energetic. Overall, there are way more mediocre and downright bad double LP\u2019s than good ones. ",
