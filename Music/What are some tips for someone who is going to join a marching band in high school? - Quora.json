            "answer_text": "I just finished my final year of band. Here are some things that helped me/would help me during my time in band. Don't be shy. Being in band does gain you automatic friends, but if you actually want to build close relationships with other band members\u2014particularly the upperclassmen when you're a rookie\u2014find the courage to talk to them. Don\u2019t just stay within your group of friends who all joined the band with you; branch out and get to know everyone.Put in the work. Don't join band if you aren't ready to work hard. Band is, in my opinion, the single most cooperative high school activity offered because everyone's mistakes are obvious, but no one can sit out for poor performance. If each band member does as much as they can for the band, the band will shine. A few slackers can seriously damage morale and overall performance level.Be excited. Band is great! Keep energy and motivation high by doing chants or cheers during a hard practice\u2014within reason, of course. Give shout-outs to people who are doing a good job. Make everyone wants to be there!Start working early. Don't assume that you can start the season lazily and pick up the pace as the season progresses. Start great and end great. Most of the work you do will be at the beginning of the season, so put in the work then and maintain that level of effort for the rest of the season.Be prepared. Know when to dress for heat and when to wear extra layers or a raincoat. Bring water. Always have your music or drill sheets available. Know your music and your sets.Most importantly, have fun. Being in marching band is an incredible experience that goes by all too fast. Enjoy your time while it lasts.I hope that helps! Best wishes! ",
