            "answer_text": "The answer is that it usually depends on what you plan to use it for. In general, you are not allowed to use a copyrighted portion of someone else\u2019s work in such a way that it becomes part of your work, or you derive value from it. There are also certain exclusions to that rule for \u201creview\u201d and \u201ccommentary\u201d. For example, you can legally include a ten second clip of a song in a review about that song\u2026 \u201cto illustrate what it sounds like\u201d. You can also include a short clip of it in a report or news story about music - as \u201can example of Rap music\u201d - or whatever. However, you would be violating the copyright if you used a sample of that song in YOUR composition, where their work becomes \u201cpart\u201d of your work. (You also cannot splice together your favorite playlist and call it \u201ca report on music\u201d if it\u2019s obvious that you\u2019re simply reselling or redistributing the work of the original authors.) Note that many people violate these laws\u2026 and they are often not fully enforced\u2026 and the enforcement is somewhat variable\u2026 so you may in fact \u201cbe able to get away with\u201d using copyrighted material illegally. However, this does NOT mean that it isn\u2019t illegal. ",

            "answer_text": "Again I find myself surprised that no one asking questions about the legality of sampling ever specifies which jurisdiction they live in - laws can be different in different countries, you know, and Quora, while indisputably a US company, has users from all over the world. Thomas Ruddick is quite correct (and specific) in that the sampling is not illegal in itself - it is the uses to which it is put. I have the technology in my studio to lift audio from a movie soundtrack, but if I use it as a recognisable element in a commercially available EDM track, for example, I am laying myself open to prosecution in many countries, if I didn\u2019t get permission from the copyright holders.
