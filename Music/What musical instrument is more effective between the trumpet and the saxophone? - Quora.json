            "answer_text": "What the hell, I\u2019ll try and answer this one as well. Hmmm, it depends on what exactly you mean by \u201ceffective\u201d. As a sax player, I\u2019ve enjoyed playing alongside a few trumpet players in various small and large jazz groups. The opinions that follow are mine and, in some cases, theirs. To my mind, the trumpet is effective for cutting through when you\u2019re in a band with a lot of mid-range instruments: piano, guitar(s), vibes, other horns. In small bands they seldom need amplification, unless they go for the muted-trumpet colour. Saxes can get lost in the middle, especially tenor in my opinion. If you\u2019ve ever listened to or played in a big-band with a strong trumpet section it\u2019s such a joy when they\u2019re screaming out the top-notes at the end of a Buddy Rich number or similar. If you\u2019re good enough perhaps you can do it on trumpet, but I\u2019ve had trumpet players complain to me that nothing can wail like a saxophone and they wish they could do that like we do. I would argue that a solo sax is more versatile in modern pop/jazz/blues etc. It blends well with the voice and is comfortable in many modern settings, whereas the solo trumpet might look a bit out of place. It shouldn\u2019t, but it does. Of course the trumpet is at home in an orchestra whereas the saxophone is still a seldom-used colour. The other big one for sax players is that you can play more than one kind (size). Sometimes you need to soar over a vocal (maybe choose the alto) or for others maybe you need to add a bit of grunt to a horn section (baritone). I\u2019m always biased towards the sax, but for the music I play, given the choice I would always play alongside a trumpet player rather than anyone else, even another sax player. ",
