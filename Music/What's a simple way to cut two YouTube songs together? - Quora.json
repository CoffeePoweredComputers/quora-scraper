            "answer_text": "In your editor of choice, you\u2019re going to load the two tracks into your timeline. They will make their own tracks and overlap. Then scrub them into the position you want. You\u2019ll use the mouse/trackpad on most software, though in Avid it\u2019s really cool to be able to use keyboard commands! Anyway, if you\u2019re trying to make a mix, you\u2019ll want to add a fade out/in on the audio tracks where one song starts and the next begins. Have fun! ",
