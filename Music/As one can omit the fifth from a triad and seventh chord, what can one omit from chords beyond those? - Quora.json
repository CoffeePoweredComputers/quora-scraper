            "answer_text": "Apart from in general being able to omit the 5th, here are some basic guidelines, when it comes to extended chords, provided we are talking about omitting notes but keeping the harmonic function similar. the 9th can replace rootthe 11th can replace 3rdthe 13th can replace 5thI learned this without explanation, but I suspect it has to do with tendency tones. For instance, with 9th replacing root, it might be that because the 9th (which for our purposes in this explanation you can think of as the 2nd) tends to resolve to the root (this is \u2018Re\u2019 to \u2018Do\u2019 resolution), the root is maybe implicity \u2018sensed\u2019 here. With 11th replacing 3rd, this like 4th replacing 3rd, and since 4th tends to resolve to the 3rd (this is \u2018Fa\u2019 to \u2018Mi\u2019 resolution), this could be viewed as the 3rd being implicitly \u2018sensed.\u2019 With 13th replacing 5th, this is like 6th replacing 5th, and since 6th tends to resolve to 5th (\u2018La\u2019 to \u2018Sol\u2019 resolution), similar to what I said about the other cases above, here maybe the 5th is being implicitly felt. In the case of 11th replacing 3rd, this is also useful for a Maj7 chord since a 4th and 3rd being in same Maj7 chord would sound somewhat odd, them being half step apart. Though odd can be good in my opinion. Beyond above, you also can think about chord substitution, where we start talking about omitting perhaps several notes and replacing with different notes from chord that can play simlar function. For instance in a Major key, the iii-Minor7 can replace the tonic I-Major7. So in C, Em7 replacing CMaj7. Then of course there are more advanced chord substitution concepts such as tritone substitution, and a bunch of others. Recommend reading about Chord Substitution, since explanations regarding chord substitution will also likely address your question. Brian Free Guitar Lessons - Guitar Dreams ",

            "answer_text": "If you are talking functional jazz chords, then the root, 3 and 7 are the only notes that actually HAVE to be there to provide the chord function. All other chord members are optional. However, there are nuances to this. For example, in a m7(b5) chord, the b5 is often considered to be an essential member of the chord, but it may be omitted anyway if it can be inferred by the listener. In a diminished 7th chord, often (but not always!) the root and 5th are the most important notes (leading tone and 4th of the next chord). Sometimes a #11 can replace the major third, when the chord can take a #11. If the chord is a sus4 chord type, then the sus4 replaces the 3rd. The major 7th (but not usually the minor 7th) can be replaced easily by the major 6th. But then, even some of those are not hard-and-fast rules. In modal music (and there is no firm wall separating modal and tonal these days) practically any combination of notes from the mode can be inferred as expressing the mode, so notes expressing chord function are kind of old-fashioned as a concept. Playing an incomplete chord (by incomplete, I mean missing the 3 and/or 7) can be very sparse and beautiful, especially if the listener\u2019s ear can fill in the missing notes easily, like G/C instead of Cmaj7. Comping instruments as well as arrangers take advantage of this freedom. ",

            "answer_text": "Theoretically, you can omit pretty much anything. For example, most 13 chords omit the 5, the 11, and the 9. For many particular chords, omissions have become chords of their own. A major or minor triad omitting the 3 has become known as a 5 chord, or a power chord. A 9 chord that omits the 7 is referred to as a 2 chord or an add 9 chord. The two most common omissions in jazz music for example, are the 5 and the 11. The 1 is often omitted from the piano for example, but the bass usually covers it. Still, not always. In jazz the 1 can be a passing tone in some aspects. So the so the basic rule of thumb is that omissions should be such that they do not disrupt the overall tonality of the chord, but rather the omission should be something that can be left out while the chord still retains its overall tonality. The most important notes in a 13 chord are the 1, 3, 7, and 13. Those four notes alone provide the tonality of a 13 chord while omitting three other notes. ",

            "answer_text": "You can omit any note you want. However, omitting certain notes will change the character of a chord if you don't have other instruments around to reinforce the chord. On a triad you can't omit more than one note. If you omit two you are left with only one note. That's not a chord. Can't omit the root note, that's your key. If you omit the 3rd you won't know if it's major or minor. On modal chords of four notes, maj7 and min7, omit the root and you lose the key, omit the 3rd and you can't tell if it's major or minor and omit the 7th and, well, it's not a 7th chord anymore. On a min7b5 chord you can't omit anything. Omitting the 5th like in the other chords would change the b5 characteristic of it. Things change if you have other instruments, like a bass for example. If the bass is playing the root note you can omit it on the chord and you still get the full chord ensemble. If you have other harmonic instruments playing with you then you can omit any note and you will still get the full chord. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer below gives a concise angle so I won\u2019t repeat that, instead I would like to mention that extension notes are what they are , so once a chord is established, then the extension notes have a rather different value when compared to the root 3rd 5th and 7th . We can use a major ninth chord without the 7th being there , but it is described as maj with added 9th . we can use a major chord with a #4 ( or #11th) and most performers would naturally tend to include the 7th and 9th as an option, unless it was specifically shown that only the #4 was needed . There are a number of circumstances like this , but with extension tones ,missing some out is a possibility but is less likely than with a basic root 3 5 7 chord , simply because they are extensions and have been chosen to be there in the chord .
