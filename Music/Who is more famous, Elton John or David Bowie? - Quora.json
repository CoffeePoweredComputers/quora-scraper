            "answer_text": "I'd say they were equally famous. There's a sort of top level of fame that you can reach, whereby you can't really get anymore famous. And both David Bowie and Elton John have reached that level. In terms of success, then that depends on how you quantify it. Elton John has sold a lot more records than David Bowie and had more hits. David Bowie is far more influential. Elton was influenced by him. Elton is obviously very influential but David more so, as he transcended music and was also a style icon, a creator of characters, film star, designer, amongst other things. Bowie has a cool factor that transcends almost everybody and certainly leaves Elton behind. And Bowie was also a master lyricist, whereas Elton doesn't write lyrics. Equally famous though, and both highly respected and important musicians. I say this as huge Bowie fan who isn't particularly into Elton John, so I may be biased here. ",
