            "answer_text": "Does Lil Wayne have cancer? In July 2017, some websites reported that that Lil\u2019 Wayne had announced that he had only one month left to live after receiving an advanced cancer diagnosis. But I can find no such announcement from Lil Wayne or his PR team on any of his official channels. And guess what, he\u2019s still alive over 2 years later. So I guess that was fake news! The news that Lil Wayne had cancer seems to have been fabricated in order to drive views to a fake news website. Nothing more. I\u2019d suggest that you only get your news from reputable or official sources. In this case, Lil Wayne\u2019s twitter would probably be a good first step. ",

Lil Wayne for sure he struggled with seizure episodes publicly sometimes and had to cancel repeatedly over the years he does less music but he's a great artist. ",
