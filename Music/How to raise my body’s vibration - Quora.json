            "answer_text": "Your vibration or level of consciousness is a combination of your thoughts, feelings, beliefs and actions and determines the types of experiences that you will attract in to your life through the law of attraction.Everything that happens in your life is a reflection of your vibration. For example, if you see the world from the consciousness of love, you will see love reflected back to you, if you see the world from a place of anger, you may attract confrontation or people may get angry easily around you. By raising your vibration the old patterns will start to drop out of your life so that you can create something better. Here are some ways to raise your vibration: CHANGE YOUR ENVIRONMENT Sometimes the environment and the people that you are around could be keeping you trapped in a lower vibration. If you spend a lot of time around certain people you will start to resonate with their energy and become more like them.Stay away from anyone who is constantly negative or draining or anyone who may see you in a certain way which triggers certain negative behaviours in you.Also sometimes wearing clothes that you wore when you were going through a bad situation can take you right back to that time or living in the same house could be holding you back by triggering certain memories or keeping you trapped in certain energy patterns.Keeping high vibrational crystals in your home can also be a great way of raising the energy in your environment. READ INSPIRATIONAL BOOKS Reading high vibrational books can help you to pick up on the vibration of the person who wrote it and even make you think like them. This means that it can be helpful to read the books of people who you want to be more like or have the type of life that you would like to create.

            "answer_text": "Raising your vibration can be defined as increasing the innate energy your mind and body give out into the world. A persons vibration is determined by the thoughts they hold within themselves, the ideas they project into the world, and the physical actions they perform. To raise your vibration, you have to focus innately on certain objectives, and continuously apply yourself towards them. When a person is continuously jumping back and forth between their motives, their vibration decreases and become incoherent. Just as two speakers playing different music next to each other would become a garbled mess, so too does the energy of a person who isn't delivering a clear message to the universe. A person who realizes their true potential always aims for greatness and avoids the trap of being average. Subpar actions and half-hearted motivation doesn't garner meaningful advancement in life. There must be deliberate choices to uncover and utilize the limitless abilities uniquely wielded by you, and only you. Most importantly, you must identify what it is you desire most, then always ensure your thoughts and actions are conducive towards those goals. Establish an identity for yourself, and strive to become a force of positive change on the people around you. Ultimately, elevating your vibration is a gradual process, where every decision made either adds to it or depletes it. Every moment is an opportunity to perform at your peak and build towards that which you desire most. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m afraid that if you want to pass through solid walls, levitate, or walk on water I have no suggestions to make. I am not convinced that these are more than metaphors for \u2018being in the world but not of the world,\u2019 or rising above the fray of existence characterized by instinctual (survival & sexual), and power (social & financial status) motives. In the above I am suggesting \u2018Centauric\u2019 life lived in the first 3 chakras which characterize all mammalian life not to mention non-mammalian species. Existence defined by the \u201cvibration\u201d of these psychic centers characterizes the majority of humanity and in most cases there is little opportunity to transcend when one\u2019s very survival dominates one\u2019s life. For those who have the opportunity to post questions on the internet there is clearly choice. One works on oneself and that work includes helping other beings. Just as the number of petals on the symbolic lotuses of the chakras increase as one works upward from sacrum to brain (except the Ajna which is an extension of the Sahasrara), this symbolism expresses your notion of higher vibration - less indulgence in sensate bodily pleasures and increasingly more subtle fulfillments from compassion and wisdom. Whether this movement is symbolized by the Yoga chakra system or by Buddhist principles of Karuna & Prajna, or by Kabbalistic Tiphereth and Chokmah, one\u2019s non-egoic Center symbolized by the Heart (not necessarily the Anahata chakra but the deeper meaning of Hridayam, Heart Cave) receives transpersonal knowledge and insight from the higher centers. Instead of disappearing into the Absolute, one receives \u201cvibration\u201d from \u2018on high\u2019 which energizes one sufficiently to remain in the world but repel socially-conditioned worldly values that merely aggrandize the ego and draw one into the densities of materialism, moral relativism, and perhaps nihilism. This is a lonely way to be btw so if one is ill-prepared to be shunned by the majority of people as one who lives as a philosopher or a mystic above the \u201clow games\u201d of the multitudes, this is not a path to begin in the first place.

            "answer_text": "A simple exercise to raise your vibration, is to sit by yourself when you wake up or when your going to sleep or during the day whenever you have time, and just observe your thoughts. Just sit there and watch your thoughts. Don\u2019t try to control them dont try to resist them dont try to fight them just observe them without being judgmental to them, simply sit there and observe. You will start to learnt he nature of your thoughts and where they go habitually and more importantly you will start to learn that you are not your thoughts. You dont have to react to all the thoughts that come your way. You can watch a thought pass by and not react to it at all. This will raise your vibration instantly because your no longer reacting your observing and then letting go of the thoughts which makes you a more powerful human being. 90 percent of human beings dont do this. They could but they dont. This simple act will raise your vibration if dont consistently. ",

            "answer_text": "When ever I want to raise my vibration I find meditation is a good place to start. I like to envision that I am opened up to love and light from the universe. Deep breaths allow me to open up and allow the energy to move through out my body. If I am in need of raising my vibration due to being plagued with negative thoughts I do this in nature or by water. I find that when I am unable to go to where I can be grounded I use affirmations and speak out loud of all the things I am grateful for at that moment. I have also instinctively done random acts of kindness which raises your vibration. Self love and care is hugely important and I have heard that earthly grown foods in they're pure form help with this as well as water and exercise. When you move the body, as in dance this also helps in raising your vibration so whether you are into dancing around a fire with group of your friends lol or bopping around your home in private, I am a big fan of this way in raising your vibration. Basically anything that makes you feel full of joy can put you in a state of raising your vibration so find what takes you to your happy place. ",

Raising our vibrational energy is thru a willingness to discover and accept that which is already in our mind body and soul. Thru practice you can raise your level of vibrational energy. For me its thru releasing all in our thinking, our understanding and situations in life that consume our thoughts and beliefs which ultimately has the incredible potential to manifest our uncertainty into certainty. Focus your wave lengths into increasing your energy vibrations and believe that only you can create, strengthen and build positive vibrations which will ultimately manifest into reality. What was once the occasional hunch or inspiration will gradually become a working part of the brain. Hope this has helped my friend. ",

Whatever we have, we want more, better, higher, stronger, as if what we have, what we are, is not enough. If you aren\u2019t satisfied with what you have, why do you think having more will do it for you? To raise the vibration rate of some form of energy requires more energy, isn\u2019t that obvious? So you want more, you have to work hard for it, and if we are to trust Einstein and his mass / energy equivalency principle, the more we raise the level of energy in any source of energy, the harder it gets to raise it even more, so whatever you did to get to your level of \u201cenergy vibration\u201d whatever the heck that means, you must do twice as much work to get half as much more whatever. Really? Raise your energy vibration? What does that even mean? On the piano, the higher rates of vibrations are just another bunch of notes to play. Higher, lower, play your piano, play it well, practice, practice, practice. ",

If one realises that everything is transitory except your relationship with divine forces then you can live your life simply, not really holding onto anything but your feelings. In this heightened state of happiness, you can connect to and with any aspect of Creation, angels etc and this connection continues forever. Well it works for me, life is a hoot and unfortunately never seems long enough . ",

Your emotions are the key to guiding your thoughts. If you find something you are thinking about makes you unhappy, change the thought ASAP. If you find yourself in a situation where you are required to think about very negative things (making funeral arrangements for a loved one, for example), the best thing you can do is to try to remain detached when clear thinking is needed. Focus on the task. Allow yourself to grieve in the manner you choose, but do so knowing there is a limit. If you are looking for a way to get a boost during the day, then choose a memory or a future goal that makes you happy and just daydream for a bit. Live it in your mind \u2018in the moment\u2019, seeing and feeling everything you can that makes you happy. Maybe not while driving, but if you have an appropriate 5 minutes that need to be filled, like waiting in line at the grocery, it\u2019s a good idea to give yourself a deliberate mood-boost. Or you can look at your watch and wish the line was moving faster. Your call. Choose happy thoughts as often as you can. This will keep your vibrations high. I have some really good articles about this posted at https://www.lawofattractioncollection.com The site isn\u2019t actually open to the public yet. It\u2019s ugly and the navigation is a bit rough.

            "answer_text": "Eat organic fresh foods, preferably in their raw state. I have heard that raw vegetables vibrate the highest. Replace pastry with fruit. Replace artificial drinks with herbal teas. Engage in a lot of exercise, preferable outdoor aerobics eg running, swimming, or just long walks in nature. Yoga is your best friend. Do stretches & meditation everyday. Most importantly, try and connect more to nature/the earth. Eg take a barefoot walk once a while. Spend some minutes here & there under the sun (if you live where there is no much sun, vit d supplements do great as replacements to natural sunlight). Lastly, love your body by keeping it from stress, 8hours of sleep most nights & regular soaking in epsom or sea salts. ",

The faulty human right brain wastes energy generating anxiety, most other mental illness, sin, evil, greed and all human made suffering, the left logical/positive brain is energy efficient, maximising its use gives the feeling of oneness/inner-happiness which is the feeling of brain energy efficiency. EGMi is a new TOE and practice based on energy driven evolution theory, it maximises left brain use 24/7 something few humans are yet to experience. ",

Placing yourself in a full-body microwave would thus cause your body, which is made with quite a bit of water, to vibrate.  The consequences of such action tend to be unappetizing. ",

If you are in a weakened state of health, you can use an elevator or escalator to go up. Even if you live South of the equator, this advice still works! (Thanks gravity) ",
