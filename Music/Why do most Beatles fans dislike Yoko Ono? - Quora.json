            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t speak for most Beatles fans, so I will speak for myself. I dislike Yoko because: She has always lied and will continue to lie about how she and John ended up together. The myth that she didn\u2019t know who John was has been so thoroughly debunked, I can\u2019t see why she keeps insisting it\u2019s true.She was instrumental in driving a wedge between John and Paul. Before Yoko came along, John was proud of the work he did as a Beatle and he was happy to call Paul his friend. Once Yoko started whispering in his ear, John turned his back on Paul and the group. You can easily see this when you look at how Allen Klein got his hands on the Beatles. He promised Yoko a big exposition, so Yoko liked him. This meant John wanted Klein too, and that set the ball rolling. I\u2019m quite sure that without Yoko supporting Klein, that part of the Beatles breakup saga would not have happened.She did not break up the Beatles. She did, however, speed up the process. Her presence and interference heightened the already present tensions. It was Yoko who introduced John to heroin and got him addicted, which was one of the defining factors in the breakup. I know people will say it was John\u2019s choice to bring her into the studio. And they\u2019d be right. However, being much older than the Beatles, Yoko should have been the wisest and either told John she wouldn\u2019t go along with it (she could have elected to sit in the control room, for example) or she could have just kept quiet. Instead, she happily offered her opinion when the others didn\u2019t want it, commented on the songs, inserted herself into conversations, and acted atrociously when she didn\u2019t get enough attention. There are tapes of her endlessly screaming and wailing into a microphone when John was talking to the producers and Paul was trying to practice a piano part. Nobody can deny this was detrimental to the group\u2019s dynamics.After the Beatles, Yoko continued to talk negatively about the others, mainly Paul. She wrote most of the lyrics to \u2018How Do You Sleep\u2019 and it was Yoko who said Paul was to John what Salieri was to Mozart. In the final years of John\u2019s life, she purposely kept Paul away from John, intercepting his phone calls whenever she could.I find it grating how Yoko never gives a clear, direct answer to anything. The way she behaves and presents herself is often inappropriate. It\u2019s her prerogative to live her life as if it\u2019s a piece of avant garde art, but when she uses that to draw attention to herself at events that aren\u2019t about her, it\u2019s just rude behaviour.Last but not least: she treated Julian horribly. Not only did she keep him away from John for years (it was May Pang who made sure John would reunite with Julian), she would also tell a 17-year-old boy he couldn\u2019t bring his mother (John\u2019s ex-wife) to John\u2019s funeral, she also didn\u2019t give Julian any of John\u2019s things. Julian had to go to court to get some sort of inheritance and ended up spending most of it just to get some of his father\u2019s things. Paul McCartney also bought many of John\u2019s possessions so Julian could have them. Yoko never wanted him to have anything and she never ever acknowledges Julian. To this day, everything on John Lennon\u2019s social media platforms presents Sean as John\u2019s child. Julian is never mentioned.To me, there are many reasons to dislike Yoko. I didn\u2019t even name all of the objections I have against her\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a Beatles fan, I\u2019m Asian, and I do dislike Yoko. However, I don\u2019t blame her for breaking up the Beatles. The truth was that they were already headed towards a split, especially with Brian Epstein\u2019s death and George Harrison not wanting to be limited to contributing 2 or 3 songs per album. The latter might have been okay in the early years but he had improved so much as a songwriter by then. That, and Paul\u2019s bossiness, are the main causes of the band. It\u2019s really ironic because Paul was trying to keep them from breaking up and he turned into one of the causes that led to it. So, if I don\u2019t blame her for the breakup, why do I dislike her? Heck, I don\u2019t even think that she was that bad of an artist. So, I will list my reasons for why I dislike Yoko. The way she treated Julian didn\u2019t really sit well with me. She could have given Julian at least some of his father\u2019s belongings without choosing to auction them off. Therefore, Julian had to buy back those belongings with his inheritance that he had to sue her to get. Luckily, Paul was kind enough to buy back some of John\u2019s stuff for Julian. Yoko\u2019s team has even sent him a cheque for $1 during their legal battle.The story of how John and Yoko met. The official story is that they met at an art gallery when John showed up to her exhibition, she didn\u2019t know who the Beatles were, and then it was love at first sight from then on. However, I personally find it very hard to believe that someone like her in the art scene would have no idea who the Beatles were. And considering that Paul said that she approached him first for some lyric sheets, she would have surely known who they were. Cynthia also said that Yoko would stand in front of their house and one time she even got into a car with them, sat there for a few moments, and then left without saying a word.Her relationship with Sam Havadtoy was extremely creepy. He would wear John\u2019s clothes. I just think that it\u2019s really creepy, that\u2019s all.The way she sometimes rewrote history. One example that I remember was when she edited herself into the #9 Dream music video which was recorded during John\u2019s Lost Weekend period when he was NOT with Yoko.So, those are some of the reasons that I dislike her.
