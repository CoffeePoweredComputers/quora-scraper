            "answer_text": "Honestly none of them are really stand out loud. Most people would claim that J-Hope is the loudest, but you can tell when there\u2019s content outside of the usual set filming, J-Hope isn\u2019t really loud. He mostly entertains the group and the camera as part of his job as \u2018the hopeful member\u2019. Outside of that, he\u2019s generally a little reserved, although easy to laugh. There\u2019s no real loud member. They\u2019re the type of people to be quiet alone, but compound on each other when they\u2019re together, and become loud as a group. The loudest member of BTS is in fact, BTS. ",
