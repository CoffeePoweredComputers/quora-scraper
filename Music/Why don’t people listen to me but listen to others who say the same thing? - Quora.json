            "answer_text": "Why don\u2019t people listen to me but listen to others who say the same thing? I have found over the years that it\u2019s true that people will listen to some people and not to others or I\u2019ve had this experience\u2014I\u2019ll say something and the person repeats what I\u2019ve said almost verbatim but acts as though it was her idea. (My doctor comes to mind.) When my husband was alive, he told me something kind of quirky and interesting that a colleague of his whom I knew had said. We\u2019d refer to the idea and laugh many times over several weeks. I have no memory of what it was, but I thought it was clever. Then one day he admitted that it was his idea\u2014that his colleague hadn\u2019t said it. I said, \u201cWhy did you pretend that it was his?\u201d He replied, \u201cI figured you\u2019d respect the idea more if it was coming from him and not me!\u201d I could hardly believe this and didn\u2019t understand how I\u2019d led him to believe that I\u2019d be more respectful of an idea if it came from someone other than him. However, I imagine that he might have been more respectful of an idea if I told him that it came from someone he had high regard for. I think that when you have a very close, intimate relationship you\u2019ve seen the other person at their absolute worst. So you might have a tendency to respect the ideas of people whom you haven\u2019t seen at their worst\u2014people who still haven\u2019t fallen off their pedestals. One of my brothers and I love to reminisce about my mom and the respect she had for certain people\u2019s ideas and the lack of respect she had for others\u2019 ideas. My brother and I were at the bottom of the totem pole. My mom\u2019s brother held a high position in the hierarchy, one of my brothers was also very high up\u2014they probably vied for top billing. However, her beautician probably rated highest of all. Her hairdressers changed throughout her life, but each one was highly regarded by my mom. She never had a critical word to say about her hairdressers. Beauticians talk to a lot of people and pick up a lot of knowledge along the way\u2014they can be very charming. They had my mom believing they could do no wrong. I think it\u2019s human nature. Maybe we all have this way of respecting the opinions of certain people to a degree, but some people seem to have this idiosyncrasy to the extreme. ",

It would make this world a much better place :-) Do these people trust you emotionally? If they do, they will likely listen to whatever you have to say - if they don\u2019t, then it just doesn\u2019t matter, what you say. I learned a lot from this TED-Talk here - in short: \u201cPeople don\u2019t buy what you do, they buy why you do it!\u201d Take a look: \u201cHow great leaders inspire action\u201d https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action ",
