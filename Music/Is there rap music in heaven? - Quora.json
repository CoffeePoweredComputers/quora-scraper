            "answer_text": "Music sex dance etc are not bad but how it affects this soul is the problem . If you listen to certain kind of music you would be motivated to do certain things right ? so what essentially happens is that it lowers your body vibration . If there was no system of marriage people would be more animalistic .so when we see a couple , we think they are dating and may be somewhere down the line they would get married .if you stop thinking and pay attention to the self that orders the body ,the self which gets lonely , not the body or brain for 20 mins everyday , not thinking about the world , God will awaken inside you starting with lil bit of vibration here and there which is mediation , quite mind genarate a lot of vibration in the body healing and so on . Okay let's go back to original question , the soul you own has no gender so you can be anyone you want , you can listen to music dance do things that was not possible in this world , you will be the owner of a world that revolves around you .

People like to think of rap as a genre for gangsters and killers etc. when in reality theres so much variety in it and so many artists, and if your friend likes rap music and heaven is paradise, why not?
