            "answer_text": "When it comes to \u201ckiss my ass\u201d, there are quite a few songs that do it well. Most of the time, I favor punk and occasionally rap for this kind of thing. N.W.A had some unhappy experiences with the police. At one point, the members of N.W.A were forced down on the sidewalk face down with guns pointed at their heads. And they responded with the bluntly titled \u201cFuck tha Police\u201d  This may be the most infamous anti-police song ever.  At the time they made their self-titled album, The Adolescents were a bunch of suburban teenagers who hated everyone around them. Since I was also a suburban teenager who hated everyone, I found their rage pretty relatable.  Teenagers saying \u201cI hate high school\u201d isn\u2019t new, but I thought the Adolescents were really good at it.  When the Dead Kennedys wrote songs about people they hated, they were sometimes pretty humorous about it. When a local awards show invited them to perform for \u201cnew wave credibility\u201d, the Dead Kennedys responded with a sarcastic attack on the music industry called \u201cPull My Strings\u201d.  This is my favorite \u201ckiss my ass, music business\u201d song.  Punks often didn\u2019t like the police any more than rappers did. Black Flag had a fun little tune called \u201cPolice Story\u201d. While it\u2019s not as well known as N.W.A\u2019s song, Ice-T of all people liked \u201cPolice Story\u201d enough to do his own cover years later.  Black Flag was good music for my \u201chate-fueled teenager\u201d phase.  If we\u2019re talking about punk rock \u201ckiss my ass\u201d songs, I\u2019ve got to mention the Sex Pistols. Their song \u201cGod Save the Queen\u201d was one of the first songs I\u2019ve heard with so much hatred directed at one person in particular.  It\u2019s angry enough to make me forget that I\u2019m an American who doesn\u2019t hate the British royal family.  The Circle Jerks were another punk band from Southern California. And like a lot of punk bands from Southern California, they had some angry songs about their hatred of the place.  Like the Sex Pistols example, this song makes me forget that I don\u2019t hate Beverly Hills.  Tupac Shakur was very angry towards East Coast rappers. And it showed in his song \u201cHit \u2019Em Up\u201d While I find it hard to enjoy the song because of the events surrounding it, \u201cHit \u2019Em Up\u201d is a very effective \u201ckiss my ass\u201d song.  R.I.P. Tupac and Biggie Smalls.  Nas and Jay-Z had their own feud in the early 2000s. In my opinion, the best song from that feud was Nas - \u201cEther\u201d. When Nas is at his best, he\u2019s arguably the most talented rapper I\u2019ve ever heard.  The song was so effective that ether became hip-hop slang for humiliating someone.  Fuck tha Police is my personal favorite song from this list, but I thought all those songs were good. If you must say \u201cKiss my ass!\u201d N.W.A did it in the most inflammatory, rage-fueled manner possible. ",

            "answer_text": "What is the best \"You can kiss my a__\" song of all time? I'm going with \"Positively 4th Street\" by Dylan. Who says that saying \u201ckiss my ass\u201d has to be verbally harsh? There is one song I\u2019m thinking about that is one of the most popular songs by the group that released it, has a great beat to it, is fun to sing along and has even been used in TV commercials. Yet the lyrics of the song are definitely an in-your-face \u201cF___ you\u201d, but in a poetic way. The backstory of the song in question is that two of the band\u2019s members had a torrid on-again, off-again relatonship. One of the couple released a breakup song that, at the time, was seen as a masterpiece of what was called The Breakup Wars of 1976. Then, the other member of the couple penned what turned out to be a blistering response of his own to her, and it turned out to be the seminal song for the group. The irony of this is that both remained in the group for a number of years singing the songs, both for the audience at each performance but also to each other. Have you guessed who I\u2019m talking about yet? It\u2019s Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham of the group Fleetwood Mac. Nicks released Dreams about her relationship and breakup with Buckingham. The song appears on Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Rumors album, probably the best the group has produced. Then, in response to Nicks\u2019 song, and appearing just three tracks later on the album, comes Buckingham\u2019s Go Your Own Way. Right off the song starts with Buckingham singing \u201cLoving you isn\u2019t the right thing to do\u201d. From there, the song just starts to burn and Buckingham sings the immortal words: \"If I could / Baby, I'd give you my world / How can I / When you won't take it from me?\" Such a great song, and yet many don\u2019t know that it was Lindsey Buckingham\u2019s way of saying to Stevie Nicks, \u201cYeah, I can play that game, too.\u201d When you watch the video below, filmed in 1977, you can see the agnst in both of their faces as they sing the song just feet away from each other.
