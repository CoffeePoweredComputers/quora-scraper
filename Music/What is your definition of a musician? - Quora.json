            "answer_text": "I have many years of experience playing in bands and collaborating with other people who play musical instruments, but I do not consider all of them musicians. Many clearly do it because playing music - especially electric guitar and, to a lesser extent, piano / keyboard, bass guitar, and drums - attracts the opposite sex. The guitar has been a powerful sex symbol for over 60 years, and males in particular are often drawn to it simply because they want to attract females. Many people think it effortlessly makes them more appealing in general and gives them an identity without having to work at crafting their own. They often don't listen to the other people they play with or interact with them musically; they're in their own head, the star of their own stage. They're frustrating to play with because they don't care to take part in the group dynamic, take notice of what key or tempo you're in or when you want to shift to a new passage...things that come naturally when you have musical chemistry with someone who is a musician. There is little to no musical interactivity with these players. They are often extroverts and/or narcissists who believe they are far more gifted than they really are, typically equate more expensive and renowned music equipment as \"better\" and blindly purchase a lot of it thinking it makes them better players, relish being onstage for all the wrong reasons, and tend to stick to one or two genres at the most, identifying themselves simply as \"metalheads\" or \"shoegazers,\" for example. Many of them think that they don't have much to learn, that they're far more experienced and knowledgeable than they actually are. Most of all, they don't see these things in themselves - if you asked someone who possesses some of these traits to look at this paragraph, they will likely not make the connection and continue to think highly of themselves as musicians. A musician plays music because he or she doesn't have a choice - music chose them, not the other way around. They appreciate music of all kinds regardless of whether it's something they're naturally drawn to or not, and they recognize the importance of understanding all types of music, that it helps them to become better at their own craft. They create their own music and are, more often that not, extremely critical of their own work, wrought with self-doubt about whether they possess true talent (I'm highly suspicious of an artist of any medium who isn't at least a little critical about themselves and their work - this is not to say that they're incapable of being proud of their work). When they improvise with other musicians, they listen to them, paying attention to the music as a whole and figuring out how they can best participate and add to it rather than trying to drown everyone else out and play over them rather than with them. They can give and take unspoken improvisational cues that communicate that the tempo is about to speed up or slow down or the group is about to segue into something different. They may be classically trained and read sheet music or they may be self-taught and play by ear, but they understand the inner-workings of music and are always open to learning more - more about the instrument(s) they play, more about the other instruments present in the music they like, more about music history and theory, about recording and sound production and tonality, more about other musicians from whom they draw inspiration and who help them to craft their own personal style, their voice. A true musician always has more to learn and will openly admit this, because it's true of everyone no matter what they do and it's nothing to be ashamed of. Music is an absolute necessity to musicians - it's their lifeblood, one of the driving forces in their lives, and as important to them as air and water. Without it, they are simply not complete. That is my definition of a musician. ",

            "answer_text": "To me a \"Musician\" is one who can embrace all aspects of music.  He/She may choose to focus on one or a few of them, but they acknowledge and appreciate the entire spectrum.  If you only play songs by other artists with no personal interpretation, then you're an instrumentalist; which is great.  The world needs instrumentalists, but you're not the interpretive vessel of the music.  You're not truly a part of the musical journey.   Music begins in nature.  It injects itself into the Composer through inspiration, evolves onto the page or the recorded sound through motivation, fervor or fanaticism, then finds its way to its audience through audible communication via technique, interpretation and passion.  This music that we all love utilizes many vessels; all of which are \"Musicians\".  From Composer to Transcriber to Conductor to Performer to Technician; all are musicians who embrace each facet of the art and help it to find its audience.  The Musician may be one or many of the group, but to be any part of the musical journey is to be a Musician. ",

            "answer_text": "A musician is a creator. He could create an electric atmosphere as a performer for the audience. He could create compositions and arrangements of music. He could create sound textures that could render the arrangement or raw music as fresh pieces of music. Musician is essentially bestowed with the power of creation. It is this power that sets him apart and gives him or her the ability to connect with an audience at the subconscious level, making them move to his or her tunes.  A musician should have a broad base of knowledge, not only limited to various kinds of music, but to greater facets of humanity like our history, existence, myriad cultures, socio-economic situation in the world, micro cosmos and macro cosmos, metaphysics, politics and the game of thrones (not the game of course!), sensitivity to living forms, empathy towards fellow beings etc. All of these aspects gives the musician a wider dimension of canvas to create, a wider perspective to colour the canvas and a wider audience to reach out to!

But I\u2019ve played in enough bands to know that the guys like to play with me so I must be doing enough right to call myself a musician. It also helps to know a lot of songs. ",

Musicians grow up struggling in their life, they learn a lot of things from experiences and that is what later turns to the lyrics (maybe maybe not). Musicians feel loved and are full of love. They want to spread this love through the art of music. They feel inspired and motivated with music because that whats cured them when they were suffering and then want to bring this blessing to everyone in the world. ",

However, we can apply texture in an aural way as well. In music, texture refers to the interaction of melodies and harmonies within a song. These parts can be instruments, singers, or a combination of both.the texture of music can be thin or thick, thin texture being music with few differing musical parts and thick texture being music with many differing musical parts. We can think of texture like a sandwich. The more ingredients you put on your sandwich, the more flavors you will taste in one bite. A rapper is not a musician in any sense. Musicians use musical instruments to compose music. Now, a human voice can be used as an instrument, but with most rappers they only use their voice to rap and don't create any music beyond that.  ",
