            "answer_text": "What are some common chord progressions used by Paul McCartney? I\u2019ve noticed that Paul McCartney has this distinct style of using 7th chords, really tense changes resolving into maj or min, ascending chords, etc. I would look into it myself but I\u2019m transcribing a jazz solo at the moment and thought I could save some time if I asked someone who may already know. I think your assessment is accurate. McCartney\u2019s changes were often far more complex than the average pop music of his day. And he did this intuitively. Remember, Paul was not musically educated. He just felt these melodies and worked out the chord structure intuitively. Even very early on, a young McCartney would use chord structures that had more in common with jazz torch songs of previous decades than with blues-based rock \u2019n\u2019 roll or the pop/rock of the late 1960\u2019s and beyond. For example, the chords to the song If I Fell shown below are the intro section and the first verse. Note how he uses the half-step changes in the intro to kind of build up tension before launching into the wonderful I - II m - III m - progression that graces the first line of the song.  Such unconventional changes are one thing that make Beatle\u2019s melodies\u2014including many early ones\u2014work very well as instrumental tunes. Here is my arrangement of this song for classical guitar:  Imagine trying to do this with a lot of the blues-based I - IV - V chord progressions of most pop/rock, even today. It just doesn\u2019t work that often. No wonder so many Beatles tunes endure while some of the more simplistic pop/rock recordings of the past half century fade into well-deserved obscurity. A similar early McCartney tune (note that both these examples are credited as Lennon-McCartney but are very much Paul\u2019s style) is Here, There, and Everywhere. Both songs are kind of syrupy sweet by today\u2019s standards lyrically speaking. But the chord structures give them new life as wonderful instrumental melodies. This song has a similar intro using half-step intervals before launching into an ascending progression:   ",

            "answer_text": "McCartney is so blessed with the gift of melody that he can work magic with relatively simple chord progressions. For now, I can cite one example of an ascending progression that works (though I\u2019d hardly say it\u2019s common for him): In the \u201cOne Sweet Dream\u201d segment of the Abbey Road medley, there are nice ascending chords, first starting on C in the instrumental portion. Then in A for the singing. A (\u201cOne sweeeet dream\u201d) , B7, C (\u201cpick up the bags..\u201d) that half-step up is yummy for those of us who can hear the chords as I can. then E7 back to A. I don\u2019t know that that is representative, but it\u2019s a nice example. I answered because I know everything in terms of melody and chords by The Beatles and Sir Paul (if i exaggerate, it\u2019s not by much; I was reared on their music) But I also answered because I\u2019m transcribing a Jazz performance as well. Trying to work out one of Tatum\u2019s renditions of Sweet Lorraine. It\u2019ll probably take me about a dozen or so years, but once I master it, I\u2019ll post a vid online. ",
