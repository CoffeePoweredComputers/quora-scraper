            "answer_text": "Not even by far. Despite the typical expected backlash given to a new show that tries to do something different from the usual old stale format, Star Trek Discovery is a far stronger show that most Trek shows are at this stage in their development. If we are to count the 29 episodes in comparison to any other Trek series, quite frankly only TOS in its first 29 episodes could be counted as stronger. TNG\u2019s first season is nearly unwatchable, if it had aired in today\u2019s TV landscape, it would have been run off the air faster than how some people are acting towards Discovery. DS9 and VOY had shaky premise that they weren\u2019t quite figuring out and unfortunately character development was hard to find. ENT came out strong with a good pilot two parter but quickly fell into a typical weekly format that really offered nothing new that wasn\u2019t already done before except with some really weird obsession with decontamination soft porn scenes. Discovery had faster character development, in fact even in its first season of 15 episodes, we see Burnham, Tilly, Saru, Stamets, Tyler, and so on, change very clearly. There are very strong character arcs. Whether one like the development or not, it was there. Characters grew and changed and those changes stuck, they mattered. Emotional consequences weren\u2019t reset at the end of every episode so that characters simply remained mostly unchanged automatons, like it\u2019s out of some stepford wives movie. The story arcs had its beginning and end, it knew the points it wanted to hit and it structurally works in carrying a fully realized and serialized arc. All of that backed by an amazing cast of actors who are given materials to have emotional depth, and a hard working crew who create such amazing costumes and designs and VFX. The show is well acted, with a strong foundation, and it looks beautiful. If I were to compare 29 episodes of Discovery against every other series side by side, Discovery easily comes in at #2, only below TOS simply because TOS set the foundation that every other series walked on. And even that I would argue that in terms of character development, Discovery did it much better for numerous characters whereas TOS only had main focus for Kirk and Spock and occasionally McCoy but even then the characters never truly changed and grew. And that quick frankly has been my long time critique of older Trek, the lack of character development and momentum which quite frankly they really didn\u2019t master until much later in any of the series. So in that department, Discovery definitely is stronger. Though as of right now, Picard is giving Discovery a run for its money with how confident and deliberate its writing is for its first season of 10 episodes. Undoubtedly someone will have probably said it is the worst, and someone else may have also accuse it of not following canon. Except it does follow canon, it follows canon exceedingly well as any previous Trek shows. The only difference is that for a Star Trek show in 2017 onward, it needed to update the aesthetics to work for the audience. It cannot be held back to 1960s designs. Even Roddenberrry sought to change his own creation when technology and production changes came along that could mean doing different things. Discovery follows canon while also recognizing that it needs to work for a modern audience beyond its circle of hardcore fans. A franchise doesn\u2019t grow if you only appeal to people who already like it, you grow it by gathering new fans. And if Star Trek is to compete in a modern TV landscape, it needed to grow and change and mature, whether in storytelling tactics or in production designs. And if nothing else, the fact that Discovery honored its canon roots in breathing new life to characters from an old failed pilot and giving them powerful stories to the point that fandom is now clamoring to have them spin off into their own show, that speaks to its success in balancing its roots yet also growing into the modern era. I mean, casting a new Spock to take over Leonard Nimoy, and this time not even a Spock from a different timeline but Leonard\u2019s Spock, the fact that the casting of Ethan Peck worked, that it was embraced by fans so much that they want him to continue playing Spock in a show alongside Anson Mount as Captain Pike and Rebecca Romijn as Number One, continuing the dream Roddenberry had over half a century ago, what more of an indication can there be that the show not only succeeds but also knows its canon. And now with it going into Season 3 and flung into the far future with endless possibilities and no boxes to force them in, I have no doubt that Discovery will surprise a lot of people who will finally have to take notice. Discovery is boldly going into an era that no one has gone before and fulfilling Roddenberry\u2019s dreams of a modern Star Trek. So is it the worst? No. Its first two seasons are honestly some of the strongest Trek. They accomplished in 29 episodes what most Trek shows took about more than over 50 episodes to get into, especially in terms of character growth and emotional depth. I won\u2019t be surprised that one day when we look back on Discovery years later, we will see more love for it, more people coming around and letting go of prejudices. After all, this happened with TNG, and this especially happened with DS9, which is Discovery\u2019s spiritual predecessor. I love Star Trek Discovery, and I can\u2019t wait to see more. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t believe it is. Discovery did a lot of odd things at the start. They almost destroyed the Klingons (two things: too much Klingon being spoken, and the lack of hair), and haven\u2019t really succeeded in doing the non-hetero relationships they thought was necessary in a very convincing way. At least didn\u2019t do it many favours by having two such whiny characters playing the parts. And I still don\u2019t understand why the main character is a woman with a male name. And the spore drive was a really, really bad idea. But it is at least trying to be original, and the second season is just filled to the brim with fan service; tying stuff together, erasing past mistakes (I loved the casual way they fixed the bald Klingon problem). They went completely the other way, and are now bending over backward to make a true Trek series. I still think the whole \u2018follow the pretty lights\u2019 was a bit of a too simple approach of doing a plot arc, but it basically followed the concept of the Xindi plot of Enterprise: every week a \u2018clue of the week\u2019 episode that takes you a bit closer to the final confrontation. It wasn\u2019t too original, but it moved the story along at a good pace. That\u2019s also what I liked about Enterprise; it was at least trying to be different. Obviously, the original series and the first reboot are never going to be a contender for \u2018worst Star Trek series\u2019, so that leaves Deep Space Nine and Voyager. Deep Space Nine took a long time to get going (just like Enterprise), but once they decided to steal the idea of an overarching storyline from Bablylon 5, and stole the main plot along with it, things improved significantly. So that leaves Voyager as the worst Star Trek series produced (leaving the cartoons aside for the moment). It was filled with episodes that were often third go\u2019s at stories that had been done in TOS and TNG before, barely considered any of the ramifications of being isolated in the delta quadrant by having an unlimited supply of photon torpedoes, shuttlecraft and other supplies throughout the series, had a totally inconsistent approach to morality, one week sacrificing themselves needlessly due to some moral constraint that should be trumped by the need for survival, and the next week they don\u2019t give a damn and go for it. The later episodes are better. You can always tell by Janeways hair if you should risk watching an episode. If her hair is down, it\u2019s possible that the episode is ok. If her hair is in a bun, it\u2019s a derivative remake of an old story from the early seasons. Discovery is definitely better than Voyager. It\u2019s more original than DS9 and TNG. ",
