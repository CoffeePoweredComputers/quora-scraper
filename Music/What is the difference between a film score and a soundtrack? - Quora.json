            "answer_text": "A film score is the music composed specifically for the movie to serve and enhance the story. It is usually instrumental only so as not to compete with dialog. It is also called underscore (a term I, as a composer, find ever so slightly belittling) or even incidental music (that one makes me bristle a bit). The term soundtrack can refer to several things, depending on use. In the broadest sense it simply means everything you hear in the movie - sound effects, dialog, music. This meaning is usually applied in a more technical setting, in reference to the sound as opposed to the visuals. Soundtrack can also refer to the entirety of the music in the film, encompassing score AND songs that were either licensed or written for the film. Confusingly enough, oftentimes record companies will release a soundtrack from a movie which does not include any of the score. Generally that's because people are more interested in listening to songs from the movie that were written to stand alone, as opposed to score which was written to be part of the whole of the film. So the term soundtrack can also refer to only the songs in a movie, excluding the score. To illustrate the point - a few years ago I was hired, along with the singer of Korn, Jonathan Davis, to compose and produce five original songs and the score for the movie Queen of the Damned. When the movie came out Warner Bros. Records released what they called the Queen of the Damned Soundtrack. That collection was comprised of the five songs Jon and I wrote plus a bunch of other songs that were licensed for use in the film. That record quickly sold over 700,000 copies - I actually don't know what the total is by now. Immediately after releasing the 'soundtrack' record WB Records also released what they dubbed Queen of the Damned, the Score Album. That record had only the orchestral score tracks on it - and, because of union restrictions, only 30 minutes of the 70 plus minutes of score were included. That perhaps has sold 20,000 copies total to date. Same movie, same record company, same names on the covers (me and Jonathan).  As an aside - composers will often ask for and get a credit in the main title and ads for a movie that reads 'music by', as in Music by Danny Elfman. It is usually a bit of an inaccurate credit, as it implies that all music in the film was composed by that person. That is rarely the case as most films also contain pre-existing songs licensed for use in the film. But most film composers, myself included, prefer the 'music by' credit because the general public doesn't know what 'score by' means. Capice? ",

            "answer_text": "Lets talk about degrees of honesty: Most Honest: A soundtrack album contains excerpts from the actual recordings of music recorded especially for the film, and actually used in the film. To be sure, the artificial sound effects, location recordings of natural sounds, and dialogue are almost never included, but we are used to, and can tolerate, that little fib, especially if the album is sold as music from the soundtrack. Less honest, and intolerable: A recording of music from a motion picture, that is not from the original soundtrack, but is labeled \u201csoundtrack.\u201d This is execrable even if this recording is sonically or musically better than the original soundtrack. I like the comment of Richard Gibbs, \u201c\u2026 underscore (a term I, as a composer, find ever so slightly belittling) or even incidental music (that one makes me bristle a bit).\u201d I would say that \u201cbackground music,\u201d is another offender. The dictum that music should necessarily be in the background, and not call attention to itself is horseshit. Sometimes you might want that, but some of my favorite film scores are largely foreground music. Examples include much of the work of Bernard Herrmann, including the violin glisandi in the shower sequence in Psycho, which Hitch didn\u2019t want at first, but when they were demonstrated to him, told Herrmann, \u201cI was wrong, my boy.\u201d They went so well with the sound of a knife repeatedly plunging into a casaba melon, which Hitch selected by listening to various melons being stabbed while his eyes were closed. Other largely foreground music in movie include 2001: A Space Odyssey, Around the World in 80 Days (1956 version), Kings Row, Ben-Hur (1959 version), Lawrence of Arabia, and, of course, Star Wars, and the like.
