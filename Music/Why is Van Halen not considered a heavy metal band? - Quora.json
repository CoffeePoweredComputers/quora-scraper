            "answer_text": "They outright have always said they\u2019re not, so there\u2019s that.The definition of what is and what is not \u201cheavy metal\u201d has changed over the years, it changed from the time when Van Halen first began in the mid-70s, to before the David Lee Roth era was over. So this is going to color further reasonings that I give here.It used to be that \u201cheavy metal\u201d meant being from England, having really long guitar solos, and studs and leather. None of that applied to VH.Back in those days, you didn\u2019t call Aerosmith a heavy metal band either.A song like \u201cI\u2019m The One\u201d or \u201cIce Cream Man\u201d did not fit what one would call heavy metal back in those days. NOW: One can say that VH were changing the definition of what Heavy Metal WAS/COULD BE at the time, without them or anyone else really even knowing they were doing it. That\u2019s the thing about music; ofttimes, big changes cause controversy at first but can only be understood years later in retrospect.Their \u201cBro-Before-Bro Was a Thing\u201d attitudes and sense of humor set them apart from other bands.After Roth left, they were closer to Journey or Night Ranger than anything else.Of course there are close to a million reasons why VH ARE A Heavy Metal Band: \u201cEruption\u201d I mean, what else needs to be said?They had awesome production and sounded awesome coming out of car speakers.They were the template for a horde of the hair bands that followed in later years.After a certain time frame, everything with guitars became \u201cheavy metal\u201d. Aerosmith, AC/DC, Zeppelin, Bon Jovi, etc.So your question is open to interpretation. To be sure, a majority of VH fans do NOT call them \u201cheavy metal.\u201d However many in the field, would call them an undeniable influence on heavy metal, and also, if they are not exactly a \u201cheavy metal band\u201d definitely made some \u201cheavy metal songs\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "There isn't any kind of real defining line (musically) that seperates the two (heavy metal and hard rock). People have opinions as do I, but there is nothing and no reason for Van Halen not to be considered Heavy Metal. But, (having said this, lol) if there is a reason it's because the term \u201cheavy metal\u201d wasn't around when these bands were coming up. AC/DC is the same thing. But you can't really seperate these bands musically. If Van Halen weren't from California and had come over with the N.W.O.B.H.M. there is no doubt they would now be considered Heavy Metal. ",
