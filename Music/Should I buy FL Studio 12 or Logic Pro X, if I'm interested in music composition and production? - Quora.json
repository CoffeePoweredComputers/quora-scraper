            "answer_text": "I agree with what Amos said. It really depends on what type of computer you have because Logic Pro X is only for Mac & currently FL Studio doesn\u2019t have an official release for Mac so you\u2019d have to use a PC w/ FL Studio. IF the computer\u2019s not an issue than I say go with Logic Pro X. I\u2019ve used both and it\u2019s really easy to compose songs in both, but Logic\u2019s a step ahead in that you don\u2019t have to go from step sequencer to piano roll, and then format the song. Logic is more linear so you can make all your changes without switching screens. Also, FL studio is available in tiers so you can get it for $99 but it\u2019ll be missing features. Logic Pro X is $199 and that\u2019s for the full version, and it comes with a HUGE amount of sounds. I\u2019vI\u2019m a fan of both. FL is easy to use, and so is Logic. But overall, I would say you\u2019d be better off with Logic. ",

            "answer_text": "FL studio and Logic Pro are both equally capable daws. Logic is an Apple product and is available only to Mac users. If you are a Windows user then your automatic choice would be to buy FL studio. If you are a Mac user you can buy either of the two as both these software are available on the Mac platform. Fl studio gives you lifetime updates which means you need to buy it just once and all updates in the future would be free. For Logic you buy an upgrade every time Apple releases a major version. I suggest you buy logic if you own an Apple Mac. The stock plugins and instruments are very nice. You can also think about other daws like Studio One or Bitwig. ",
