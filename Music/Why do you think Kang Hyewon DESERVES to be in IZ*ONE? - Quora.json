            "answer_text": "Why did you enlarge the word deserve. Do you think that there is not reason for her to deserve this position and thus, you are trying to emphasize why she deserves it? Do you think she doesn't meet the standards, and thus think that she had to have earned it to have reached there? Every members in the group is there for a reason, and her reason is not any less valid or unworthy than the other. You might not have such intentions taboo the member but I was just curious as to why you would enlarge the word deserve, as if it needs to be proven with solid evidence, because you yourself don't believe that she does, but I will explain anyway. This is not in any way to target you, but just me asking out of curiosity. She deserved to be in IZONE because of not only her stellar beauty but of her rapping skills, the votes and the popularity she has gained in the survival show Produce 48 and most of all, her hard work and determination. Over the course of the journey in the tv reality show, it has shown us that it was not easy for her because she came from a inexperienced upbringing and thus, had no experience in singing and dancing, and was immediately placed in the lowest rank, with the other trainees who were also in the category. But throughout the process, she has shown us that she has improved in her rapping skills, which she has held an interest for after bring part of the group, during one of the challenges that she had to sacrificed herself by assigning herself a rapping role to be able to perform the song, even if she had no experience, at all. But nonetheless, she succeeded in doing it to the best of her ability, and have began to continue her pursuit in rapping fro the remainder of the time, and proving to become a capable rapper in the future. people began to recognize her hard work and determination to do well, and through taking the viewers through the hard and tumultuous journey with its ups and downs, they began to relate and empathize with her struggle at her moments of weakness, when she would cry and become discouraged by the progress of the other members around her while she was at a state of uncertainty, and appealed to the audience more, which added to her character development in the tv show. Soon, she began to rise in ranks, one round after another, until they have reached the moment everyone has been waiting, the moment when they would reveal the twelve members that would make it to the debut line, and she was placed in the debut line, where she had become successful because of her rapping skills, and her impeccable beauty, all through her hard work and determination. From being with no experience of singing, dancing, rapping skills to become a competent and improving, but established rapper, she has shown her potential to continue growing as a rapper, performer, and artist, thus, deserving the spot in the group, that would be known as IZONE. Personally, I think that every trainee deserved to have their chance at debuting, but things don't work like that, and standards are held high, and through the formula of the creation process, people must be eliminated, while others must survive, and thus, a harsh and brutal way, for trainees to go through as in each round their future hangs in the air, and in the hands of the jugged who hold all the power in their fate. It is scary, to be unaware of their outcome and of the unknown, but all of them have to go through strife, and compete against each other through challenges to prove their worth in the next round because nothing is revealed, and everything hangs in the balance, and a round can determine if you make it or break it in the future. So, no matter their rank they all still had to give it their all, without any room for error and no time to slack around or any slip up, because the judges will always have a keen eye on them and their skills and assess them on their progress. It really shows us the cutthroat society and how the reality of Kpop is, all on a reality show and how the process can be gruesome, and cruel, but this is just how things work, and it is every man for themselves, or woman.
