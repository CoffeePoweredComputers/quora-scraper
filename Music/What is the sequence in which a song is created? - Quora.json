            "answer_text": "Composition:Verse 1, bridge, chorus, verse 2, bridge 2 (sometimes), chorus, alternative bridge, chorus, end (normally a chorus or beginning of verse 1) Lyrics:It really depends on the singer/writer. Most artists you hear on the radio do not write their own songs. There's a producer who makes the beat, and often writes the lyrics, or they have someone they hire to write the lyrics to the beat. Then the beat and lyrics are presented to a number of select artist who's label and personnel help decide if it's an appropriate song for the artist.    Ultimate Say: If you're Beyonce, of course, you have most of the say. Beginning artist's might not have the same power as those who have already made a name for themselves. It mostly comes down to the label and those representing the artist and their mediators. ",
