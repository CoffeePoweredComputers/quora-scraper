            "answer_text": " BE KIND by Halsey and Marshmello Wanna believe, wanna believeThat you don't have a bad bone in your bodyBut the bruises on your ego make you go wild, wild, wild, yeahWanna believe, wanna believeThat even when you're stone-cold, you're sorryTell me why you gotta be so out of your mind, yeah Here, Halsey says that she wants to believe that her partner has nothing bad in him but he has a huge ego that makes him do unreasonable things. She says that she wants to believe that even when her partner shows that he doesn\u2019t care, in his heart, he does but he doesn\u2019t want to show it. [I know you're chokin' on your fearsAlready told you I'm right hereI will stay by your side every night I don't know why you hide from the oneAnd close your eyes to the oneMess up and lie to the one that you loveWhen you know you can cry to the oneAlways confide in the oneYou can be kind to the one that you loveAh] She says that she knows he is afraid and is disturbed by his fears but she is with him, no matter what and she will stay by his side. She doesn\u2019t understand why he hides, closes himself, messes up and lies from the one that he loves. Even when he knows that he can cry on her shoulder, talk to her, confide in her and be kind to the person that he loves instead of shutting her away. I know you need, I know you needThe upper hand even when we aren't fighting'Cause in the past, you had to prepare every time, yeahDon't wanna leave, don't wanna leaveBut if you're gonna fight then do it for meI know you're built to love, but broken now, so just try, yeah She says that she knows that they fight and the fights even turn into an argument but she stills wants that instead of fighting with her, her partner fights \u2018for\u2019 her because she understands that he is heartbroken but they can still try to love. She is reluctant to leave him even after his shortcomings. [Chorus] I know it's hard for you, but it's not fairGoing sick in the head tryna get you thereAnd I know it's hard for you, but it's not fairIt's not fair She emphasises that even though she knows that it is hard, she still thinks that it\u2019s unfair for her to take up all the responsibility to make the relationship work so all she asks for is some support to comfort herself. [Chorus] I hope you liked the explanation. Peace. :) ",

            "answer_text": "These days people are becoming self centered and they are not respecting others. So the song Be kind is all about being kind to the ones we love. In this song the writer asks the listener that why don\u2019t he or she can be kind to their loved ones , why do they lie to them even if they know that they are the only one whom they can confide in then even after knowing all this why do they hurt their loved ones why do they close their eyes when their loved one is in pain. Even after knowing that the loved one will always be by their side no matter what then why can\u2019t they be kind. Then the loved one says He or she knows that the other wants to win in all the arguments because they know that for them ego is more than anything. At last the writer tells that even after knowing everything why can\u2019t you be kind. ",
