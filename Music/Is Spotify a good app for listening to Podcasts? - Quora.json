            "answer_text": "Spotify is definitely a great platform and if I can find the podcasts I listen to, I will most likely listen on Spotify. However, I\u2019ve noticed that while the platform is good, it\u2019s still not used by podcasters at large. The search function in Spotify is also still very difficult to use since it\u2019s very sensitive to what you search for. It will not interpret what you might have meant when searching, but instead give you results on the exact words you put in. The apple podcast application is what I\u2019ve been using since most podcasts will be available there. While I don\u2019t like the interface, it is the best place to most likely find what you\u2019re looking for. The search is much better and will give you results based on the title as well as give you options of podcasts that might be similar to what you searched for. ",

            "answer_text": "Heck yeah. We were surprised by a huge majority of people who listen to our podcast listen on Spotify. Spotify beats even Apple Podcasts and iTunes for download numbers for us. I think this is because, unlike Apple, Spotify have actually got some discoverability for new podcasts. Plus, Spotify is cross device and cross platform. Whether you\u2019re on an Apple device or Android, on a phone or desktop computer. Plus, more people listen to music than podcasts so already have and know what Spotify is. ",
