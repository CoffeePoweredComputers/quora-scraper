            "answer_text": "It is true that the second generation K-pop groups are dying, however, K-Pop in itself is on a rise.  Compared to K-pop back in 2012, there are more mainstream producers/composers than just Brave Brothers and Shinsadong Tiger; It is also now a common thing to hear about self-produced songs and albums. SM Entertainment also released a series called \u201cSM Station\u201d where they experiment with more musical genres. K-pop has also gotten more international recognition from media outlets, and more K-pop groups are frequently touring overseas. K-Con 2016 achieved over 110,000 attendance in LA & NY combined! In the google search term results, you can see that \u201cK-Pop\u201d reached its peak in 2012. Much interest came into the K-Pop scene because of peoples curiosity of what it is spiked from the release of PSY\u2019s viral hit \u2018Gangnam Style\u2019. Curiosity eventually dies down over time. However, you notice right after the spike of interest in 2012, the interest over time DOUBLED compared to pre-spike. Furthermore, like the others have mentioned, the groups you have used are passed their peak and tend to not promote as often, and new groups have become the trend like BTS, TWICE, BLACKPINK. Before it was a considered a great feat if a 2nd generation K-Pop group can hit 1 Million youtube views in one day or obtain 100 million views overall, but now the trendy new 3rd generation groups are garnering 5\u201310 Million YouTube views on first-day release and 100 million views within a year! Maybe the shock from the generation change is causing you to think that K-Pop is dying; but I\u2019m sure that first generation K-Pop fans thought that too when their popular groups started to disappear. Music trends change and Genres themselves evolve overtime. The difference between the style of k-pop music from 2009 compared to 2012 is huge! Even though the time difference was three years. Some groups are more westernized than the others but that is okay, the K-Pop characteristics are still there even if you don\u2019t exactly realize it. ",

            "answer_text": "Many people saying K-Pop isn\u2019t dying, but I disagree. It forms the integral part of the Hallyu wave, of which peaked around 6\u20138 years ago. This was also the time that K-Pop\u2019s identity both visually and aurally had found its own and became a thoroughly unique art form. You had composers like Yoo Young-jin at their peak, experimenting with different genres and infusing them into songs. Some of his compositions like Lucifer by SHINee:  and Purple Line by DBSK/TVXQ:  are K-Pop staples engraved into the minds of fans. Lucifer was released right at the summit of the wave and was one of the first KP MVs to get 10s of millions of views on YouTube. Purple Line was the first song by a Korean boyband to go to #1 on the Japanese Oricon charts and they as a group ended up with a fanbase well into the millions all over the world. These are the type of songs that define K-Pop. The catchy beats, the unusually varied timbres and decent vocals (by Western pop standards) - songs that are addictive as much as they are food for the soul\u2026 Fast forward to Summer 2011. The wave is in full swing, the sun is shining and K-Pop artists are doing performances across the world: Here\u2019s HoMin (\u201cTVXQ\u201d) performing as part of a 2-day SMTown concert in Paris  MBLAQ have released their summery \u201cMona Lisa\u201d and are making waves in South America. They visit Brazil and the hotel where they stay is crowded with fans  K-Pop flashmobs are happening all over, here\u2019s one in London  BIGBANG win a MTV EMA for best Worldwide Act  K-Pop is massive and everywhere at this point. It\u2019s in everything too\u2026 By around 2013 though, I notice K-Pop is audibly changing. There\u2019s still some good stuff being produced, but the heart of it is watering down a little - K-Pop\u2019s identity starts to fade. Over past couple of years, much of the music and visuals have become more and more generic. Even if K-Pop weren\u2019t dying in popularity, it would still be doing so as an art. But even in terms of popularity, the massive surge (hence Korean Wave) seen between 2009 and 2012 has dropped off completely now:      K-Pop seems to be like a bright, but fleeting flame. It\u2019s lost its heart and things like BIGBANG\u2019s latest album shows that\u2026 it couldn\u2019t have been further from the soul of the genre, and was full of overly Americanized themes. In time, K-Pop will probably end up just like anything you\u2019ll find in the West, and become indistinguishable from it. MADE was certainly like it. It\u2019s already slipped quite far into that already. I\u2019m happy that I got to be a part of a generation that watched as K-Pop soar as it did - it was fun and there was always something new and surprising around the corner. But all good things must come to an end. ",
