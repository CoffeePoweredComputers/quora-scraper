            "answer_text": "In the US there are lots of dance studios. I dated a guy that taught ballroom dancing. I found out I loved it. There are hip hop classes, salsa classes, pretty much anything you can think of. Even if you do not have a partner to bring, just let the instructor know. They can usually match you up with someone, if necessary. It\u2019s also great exercise and it\u2019s fun. It\u2019s great to meet new people too. I think it\u2019s easier to learn in a dance studio because everyone is at the same level. Whereas, if you go to a club, everyone is doing something different and it\u2019s difficult for me to pick up a particular style. ",
