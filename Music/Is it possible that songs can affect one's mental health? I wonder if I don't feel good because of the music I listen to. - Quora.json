            "answer_text": "I'm no expert on topics like this, but from personal experience, I feel that music can affect mental health. If you think about people who listen to classical music while studying, they usually do this because the music makes them feel calm and makes it easier to focus. Songs that are more upbeat and often classified as happy songs, can make you happier and more optimistic if you listen to it frequently. While you're listening to your song it can improve your mood, but it's important to listen to it often so that type of song gets stuck in your head. Another thing to remember while finding songs to listen to, remember that most songs it matters less about the words and more about the tune of the song, but there are some words that may stick out to you specifically. For some, it may be curse words may stick out to them, for others, it may be words like \u201cheart\u201d or \u201cpure,\u201d it could even be a full phrase such as \u201cI love you\u201d. -Julie (~\u02d8\u25be\u02d8)~ ",
