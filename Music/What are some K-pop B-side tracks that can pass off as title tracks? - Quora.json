EXO Don\u2019t mess up my Tempo - Ohh La La La & repackage Trauma It might not be as good as Tempo but I feel like this song is much better than title tracks of many groups and has potential.  BTS LY Tear -Airplane pt.2 - This song already got MV and is really popular because of its performance Sf9 Sensuous - Shadow  Kim Donghan D-Night - Born  ATEEZ All to zero - Pirate King  Stray kids I am you - N/S I know that title song is really meaningful for fans and this song wouldn\u2019t fit for title track but for me this is much better and interesting.  Seventeen You make my day - Moonwalker - It\u2019s just unit song and my preference but it would be amazing to see whole group dance to this song.  Shinee The story of light EP2 - Who waits for love  Jonghyun Poet - Hashtag  Myteen Go! - Take it out, in newest album Martian  Taeyeon Something new - Circus  MXM More than ever -Checkmate * EDIT I just found out both this song and YA YA YA were realised as title tracks. My bad.  The rose Void - Baby  TVXQ The truth of Love - Jelly love - I just really love instrumental  Title songs are usually more catchy and sometimes choosen because of its meaning but these are side tracks that I listen to more than title tracks. Also, of course this song wouldn\u2019t be able to be title track but. It\u2019s still my favorite song as of 2018. ;-;  Hope you like my favorites ~ ",

            "answer_text": "EXO\u2019s recent album Don\u2019t Mess Up My Tempo has a dynamic and refined sound, as expected of SM\u2019s use of prestigious European/American producers. The arrangements are complex and their musical ideas are very Western (my mother is a piano performance major and those were her comments after listening to the whole album). The songs in DMUMT I believe could have had their own MV and stages promoted are: GravityEdit: after a second thought, \u201cSign\u201d is better suited to be a title track compared to \u201cBad Dream\u201dThese 2 b-sides really stood out to me as a musician (also see the album first listen on ReacttotheK) because they are interesting to listen to and the production quality is evident. Few albums have b-sides as strong as EXO\u2019s. I`m not yet sure about their 2017 album The War, but I assure you that both albums are of high musical merit, and it would do you no harm to sample both. [Irrelevant, but I recently noticed many people share a common opinion that EXO`s discography was all lazily pushed through a `traditional k-pop mold`. While they do not produce hip-hop/rap or alternative music, keep in mind that SM hires only the best Western and Asian producers to set the quality standard very high, thus giving SM a reputation for being a trend-setter with a unique sound. Other companies that are mostly financially challenged can only wish to work with SM`s connections. It is only after so many other songs have been produced with a similar sound (specifically chord progressions) that people reached this conclusion.] ",
