            "answer_text": "The most popular music genre with the most longevity besides pop, which is always popular because it is a name for music that by definition is popular music, is rock music. Historically, rock music got more and more extreme decade by decade from the Beatles, to Led Zeppelin to Metallica to Pantera. It got to where you couldn\u2019t get any more extreme without sounding so abrasive that you\u2019d never have more than a little niche audience. That\u2019s why there isn\u2019t a death metal band with even close to the size of the audience Pantera had. Heavy metal is part of rock music of course, but it got popular enough and sounded different enough from, say, U2 or Bruce Springsteen that it warranted having its own name: heavy metal. Heavy metal began in the 1970s with Black Sabbath, then thrash metal (a specific type of fast heavy metal) got big in the 80s with Metallica, Megadeth and Slayer. The 1980s was the peak of popularity for heavy metal and everyone from Motley Crue to Dio to Judas Priest to Metallica was huge in the 1980s. Then a funny thing happened: Metallica got much less extreme! Some fans were mad at them and other fans loved it when they made their Black album. Then they cut their hair, changed from a heavy metal look to what they thought was stylish and recorded the album \u201cLoad\u201d playing even lighter music. For a lot of their fans that was heresy. It was something ya just don\u2019t do! Apparently Metallica either wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t continue to raise the bar, raise the standard for thrash metal, which they had been famous for in the 80s: every album Metallica made in the 80s raised the standard for thrash metal music. That left those fans looking for something else and they found it in this band:  Pantera created a whole new style of heavy metal for fans of heavy metal, pretty much saving the 1990s for them. They were as heavy as could be and Phil Anselmo had both the voice and the swagger to make Pantera a phenomenon. They were the only real heavy metal band to ever have an album debut at #1 on the Billboard charts! You could not top their sonic intensity. A bunch of bands tried and failed, as they were simply regurgitating Pantera\u2019s music. We\u2019d already heard it done by the band that created that style! Now in 2020, you can see that Pantera along with the grunge bands like Pearl Jam and Nirvana were the last bands to truly become rock stars. We\u2019ve had 20 years of nothing, thanks to illegal downloading which killed the music industry. It became impossible to make an album and try to sell it without it simply being stolen. Well, there goes the incentive to enter the music industry. Why would a bright, young talented person get into a business where the product of your labor will just be stolen? You give it to a company like Spotify, you get one million streams and you make $3,000? Where is the incentive? What is anybody gonna do with $3,000? A new Honda Civic costs ten times that! So to answer your question, until somebody invents a way where it becomes attractive to bright, young talented people to enter the music business, there won\u2019t be any of these iconic great bands anymore. The incentive has been destroyed. How would you go about fixing the problem of there being no way for a new band to get the kind of exposure they used to get from signing with a major record label? We\u2019ve found out that YouTube hasn\u2019t been the answer. They haven\u2019t created any rock stars. YouTube plays music without you having to pay for it. They diminish incentive to buy albums. Spotify basically gives the whole store away for less than the price of an album, so there isn\u2019t much money there. There has got to be somebody who will invent something that in some ways will resemble YouTube or Spotify but will in the most significant ways, will resemble a major record label. It would have to be somebody with money who is willing to take a risk so he can create a way so that once more, all these amazingly talented people who used to enter the music industry will once more have the potential to become the 2020 equivalent of Led Zeppelin, Metallica or Pantera. There has absolutely got to be a way something like that could be invented. Technology grows exponentially and if technology could be and was used to destroy an industry as huge as the record industry once was, then why wouldn\u2019t it also be possible for technology to be used in a way that instead of being destructive, is productive?

            "answer_text": "I predict that it may get more dissonant with AI in the loop. In general, we will be capitulating/surrendering to its imperfections\u2014which we will ascribe to the mysterious. It will sound like a kind of jazz. If you run random sequences in an AI system and play against them, it will sound like a free jazz, which can also be understood as something broken or fragmented. It won\u2019t be a form of avant-garde we control, but rather one that is collaborative. If this sounds like science fiction, you are correct. ",
