There is another site called 8tracks which isn't exactly \"cover\"-centric , but people upload a lot of good music mixes and covers there!! So it becomes a great place to find new stuff! Soundcloud is a pretty neat place too!! There are projects like Coversproject(coversproject.com)  which have built their own database for cover songs! ",
