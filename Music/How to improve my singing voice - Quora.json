            "answer_text": "Well. Dreamy-light vibe, with the piano. That\u2019s a pretty specific thing to do, and not too easy depending on your range. First thing first, you\u2019ll want to find a key in which you\u2019re comfortable. Of course, that heavily depends on your own voice part, so there\u2019s no real requirement for this range/area (maybe an octave, hopefully and a half or so) other than these major 2: 1: You should be able to sing soft and supported within this range And 2: It shouldn\u2019t be too high or low Starting with the first; singing soft (piano or lower) while not losing support obviously requires practice. The difficulty of this assumes skill varies. Some might find it very easy to sing with a supported sound (not wavering) very quietly, while that may be the biggest bottleneck for others. The easiest way to practice is to simply do it. Go to the most comfortable range you have, sing a note that you can maintain very easily, and try to maintain a constant decrescendo. If you ever drop the note, or waver, start again at a normal volume. Once you feel comfortable with maintaining a decrescendo to around pianissimo, do the same with less comfortable notes. This is a very important part of having a \u201cdreamy, light\u201d vibe. Now, to the second requirement. This key/range shouldn\u2019t be too high or low because usually, really high and really low notes can\u2019t really have a \u201cdreamy\u201d vibe. So limiting your key to one relatively near middle c will be a huge help in getting a light sound faster. Of course, there is one more requirement, and that\u2019s the piano. The most important thing here is to learn the piano SEPARATELY from singing. Don\u2019t try to learn how to sing with piano. First just learn to play. Then, after, you can work on combining them. It\u2019s much easier to sing while playing, especially playing at a low volume, when you\u2019re already very comfortable with an instrument. Overall, these tips and PRACTICE (both alone with singing, alone with piano, and together) will be the most important things to be able to play and sing together. Good luck, and make sure to enjoy yourself. ",
