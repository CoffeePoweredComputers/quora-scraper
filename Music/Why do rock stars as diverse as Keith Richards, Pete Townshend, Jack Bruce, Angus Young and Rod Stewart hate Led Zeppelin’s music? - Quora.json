            "answer_text": "I wasn\u2019t aware that any of those people hated Led Zeppelin\u2019s music... However, if they did, I can explain it simply with four words: \u201cMarket Share\u201d and \u201cRecord Sales\u201d. Let\u2019s suppose you were a member of a really popular band. Your singles and albums are selling well, you have upcoming tour dates, and your future seems secure. Suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere, comes not \u201cjust another band\u201d, who may or may not \u201cmake it\u201d for the long term, but Led Zeppelin. You don\u2019t mind a few \u201cOne hit wonders\u201d coming and going\u2026 quickly fading away, and making it even more apparent how great you and your band are\u2026 But a band like Led Zeppelin isn\u2019t like that\u2026 They are potentially quite dangerous to your long term success. As a talented musician, you see their talent. As someone who has sold lots of records, you instinctively know that their record sales will go huge! Massive! And why wouldn\u2019t they? They filled the \u201cHeavy Blues Rock\u201d niche left behind by Cream breaking up\u2026 They are \u201cHeavy\u201d in a time when \u201cHeavy\u201d was really coming into it\u2019s own\u2026 They have a fantastic different sound and feel, tight well rehearsed material and they all look like Rock Gods. Their album covers even have an iconic look\u2026 Teenage boys of the day love \u201cHeavy\u201d music and are almost invariably fascinated by airships. And the Teenage girls all fantasize about \u201cbeing with\u201d these mysterious and intoxicating Rock Gods. That\u2019s enough to make any professional band or musician, at or very near the top, review the current performance of their record sales\u2026 Then cringe and review their retirement savings. They know right away, that \u201cthese guys\u201d are going to be getting a substantial amount of the mostly teenage provided money that they had been living off for years. Much more for Led Zeppelin, and much less for everyone else. This is a serious threat! Time to do some damage control. Time to talk some smack. Time to publicly say that Led Zeppelin is too this, or too that, and not enough this or not enough of that. Their sound isn\u2019t pop enough, it\u2019s too pop. They\u2019re a sellout\u2026 They\u2019re too different, not different enough\u2026 Their music won\u2019t last long, etc. - Finally adding an \u201cI wish them well\u201d so as not to appear to be a jealous total douche-bag\u2026 Desperately hoping the entire time, that your credentials and \u201cinsider opinion\u201d will ensure that they\u2019ll go over like a \u201clead balloon\u201d, in a great ball of flames and ultimately disappear. Sorry\u2026 Not this time! Bands always have, still do have, and probably always will have, a very strong inclination toward competitiveness. At all levels from basement bands to the top professionals. It\u2019s not much different than different sports teams talking smack about each other. To win \u201cKing of the hill\u201d, you need to stay at the top. And most people, will do or say almost anything to maintain their status. ",

            "answer_text": "I have wondered about this myself for years. I think the honest answer is that they\u2019re simply jealous. All of the names you mention were known musicians, big stars in fact, before Zeppelin started in late 1968. In most cases it had taken them years to achieve success. Then along came Led Zeppelin and redefined what success actually meant. They sold more records, more concert tickets and made more money than any other band outside the Beatles, and they did it far more quickly than anyone else ever had. There is also a certain snobbishness common to people like Townshend and Jack Bruce, who seem to feel that Zeppelin took the \u2018pure\u2019 music they had made popular and commercialized it. This is a quite hilarious attitude to take when you consider that every single one of them got their start by copying American blues and rock n roll musicians. Maybe Zeppelin just isn\u2019t Townshend et al\u2019s cup of tea musically, which is fine\u2026but I think the truth is simply that after having the limelight to themselves for years Led Zeppelin came along and pushed them aside. It\u2019s bruised egos, nothing more. ",
