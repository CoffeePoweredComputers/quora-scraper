Often people are more interested in quality that quantity and just a bit of delectable food is sufficient to satisfy rather than quantity. We do an online pick up at our market and order from Amazon.

Add more techniques to what you have. I am convinced that greater confidence in what you already do is more marketable then something you are a newbie and unproven in no matter how appealing it might be. You can still explore and dabble if you have the inkling. Just put the most effort into what puts food on the table and you know you can use it. ",
