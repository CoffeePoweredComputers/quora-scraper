            "answer_text": "Really top tier? It gets complicated, because at that level people start making lifestyle choices which affect how many contracts they choose to take on. That said... Top fee at the Metropolitan Opera is $17,000 a night. Yup, you read that right. Kind of incredible. On top of that, certain singers (really the top of the top at this point) command enough clout to be given sponsorships to bring that number up as high as $30,000 a night. A good singer in the prime of his career performs one night out of every 2-3. And opera season is 9 months long. Assuming you're performing every 2.5 nights, that means you're singing about 110 nights a year during opera season. So that means you could make up to around $3.3M in that nine month period (likely a bit lower, because not every opera house has as high a top fee, but in that range). Out of that, 10% goes to your management, so we're left with just under $3M. But that's not including other things that pay even better, like recordings (which take just a few weeks to make and can earn hundreds of thousands of dollars), and concerts (at which a top opera singer can make $50,000 a night or more; Pavarotti's base fee for a concert was well over $100,000 at the height of his fame). These usually come with 15% management fees, but still, a top singer could make an additional $500,000 a year or more off of this side of the industry. Of course, all of this depends on the singer's desire to work that much. The schedule I've assumed involves travelling nonstop, almost never spending two nights consecutively in the same place, tons of wear on the body and the voice, etc. But if you're that successful and that driven, it's not hard at all to see a really top-tier opera singer making $3-5M a year, depending on the year.

            "answer_text": "I worked in opera management in the 1990s and although David Leigh\u2019s description is surely accurate, he is describing the minute peak of the operatic pyramid. That is, one in a thousand, maybe more, if you count the thousands of aspiring young singers with very fine voices who simply can\u2019t make a dent in the opera world fast enough to make a full career of it. Those thousands have other jobs, or spouses who support them. Even mid-range singers, who can earn say $5,000 - $10,000 per engagement, for multiple performances in the \u2018secondary\u2019 opera houses of the world, often have to pay for hotel, travel, and always for management. These singers, who have shown themselves to be accomplished, may have only five or six jobs a year. Sixty thousand dollars a year, minus expenses, ends up being a poverty wage. My point is that the notion that opera singers are rich comes from the idolization they enjoyed in the 1940s and 50s, when a tiny handful were very glamorous and very visible. ALL opera singers do it for the sheer joy of it. A microscopic percentage of aspiring singers get rich from it. ",
