            "answer_text": "Music on iTunes is retail everything must cost something as there are royalties to pay and and profit for both the owner and iTunes. Apps are different. Some are given away as public domain creative commons license. Others may cost a few dollars and Apple also takes a cut. Other apps give a basic version away hoping you will upgrade to the full version for a price. Providing free apps is subsidized by Appke for their iPhones. YouTube is free unless you want to download music. iTunes and Google Play are not free services. They only sell music and videos. A good source of some free music and video is an Amazon Prime membership. If you buy enough per year free shipping offsets the yearly fee and the music, videos and photo storage are nice perks. There is no free lubch, sorry! ",

            "answer_text": "Apple Music is a subscription service like Netflix. You pay a monthly fee and they give you unlimited access to all the content that is part of their subscription library. iTunes Music tends to cost between $0.99-$1.29 a song. That is different than Apple Music though. There are some songs that are for sale in the iTunes Store that are not available on Apple Music, but most songs are. Apple Music costs $9.99 a month for a single individual and $14.99 for a family account with up to 5 users. If you cancel your subscription to Apple Music, you lose access to all the music. If you buy music from the iTunes Store, you are purchasing a perpetual license. ",

I mean, how about you give me your services for free whenever I need them? No? Why not? Oh, you need to make a living, pay bills, raise your family, eat? Stuff like that? Yeah, so do those who write and perform the music you love. Pay for the music you want. That way, the musicians/artists/song writers you like will have a better chance to continue writing the music you love. Because you\u2019re supporting them, buying their product. ",
