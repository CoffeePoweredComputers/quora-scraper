            "answer_text": "Ah yes, grunge. Angst clouds our minds and the only solution is shooting out all of our discomfort through the strumming of guitars, the animalistic banging of drums, and grimy voices reverberating among the young\u2019uns. Grunge as a culture is indeed as dead as whatever the frick your beloved geezer chained by blood listened to back in his day. And, for the sake of simplicity; I\u2019ll be referring only to the Seattle grunge scene. This includes essentially all of the top dogs of the movement; Soundgarden, Alice In Chains, Nirvana, Stone Temple Pilots, Pearl Jam, and a few others. In particular, we shall point to the heavens and resurrect Kurt Cobain from our dusty memory storages that consist of cherished and rose-tinted moments from the pizza faced days. You\u2019ve probably seen those Nirvana shirts floating around aimlessly among the hordes of teenagers that roam the schools and claim arson and rebellious antics as their own calling. Kurt was totally all about vapid commercialism, it\u2019s true. Seeing teens wear Nirvana tees like a soulless fashion statement, unappreciative of the musical musings behind the fabric strands is certainly something that\u2019d make any band gleeful and proud. We\u2019re nearing closer to a time when the people who grew up with grunge will be dead and abandoned along with the musical relic they so heartily loved. Fortunately, Krist Novoselic smashing himself in the face with his bass has been immortalized by technology. Thanks, science. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure what is really being asked with questions like this. For the most part, these very specific subgenres, from surf to psychedelic to disco to grunge, they have very short period where they have a lot of heat for the mainstream and then go to a small group of fans. This smaller group might evolve in various ways. Joe Satriani is openly surf influenced has been around for a long time and had a period in the \u201980s where his influence was pretty strong just outside the mainstream. Psychedelic rock continues to influence a variety of genres, most notably in stoner rock. Disco has never stopped having some influence of various dance music forms over the years. As such, grunge had a brief, largely unexpected, period of mainstream excitement in the early \u201890s, as we know. Now, Mudhoney and The Melvins, who might deny the label, are both still alive and kicking. Alice In Chains has been recording and touring with its new lineup since 2006. L7 , another that might fight the label, reunited in 2014 and just put out a new album. Gruntruck just released a complete previously unreleased album. Sub Pop Records just re-released the classic Tad albums and a compilation of The U-Men, who were at an early influence on the genre. I haven\u2019t been following, but Marcus Popple's answer points to an active culture of new people working within the subgenre to create new things, which I\u2019m glad to hear. Is it a force in mainstream culture anymore? No. I\u2019m not sure it ever really belonged there anyway. Is it dead? Not exactly. It has just moved on to the smaller next stage that all of these things move on to, which is appropriate. ",
