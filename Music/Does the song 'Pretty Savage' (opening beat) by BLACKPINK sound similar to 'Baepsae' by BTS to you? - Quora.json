            "answer_text": "Short answer: Yes, but so what? The word \u201csimilar\u201d can be remarkably subjective and/or potentially emotionally charged when you press the average Quoran, and so you're bound to get a wide range of answers with a question like this. And I can honestly see why some would draw a line between the two. So here\u2019s my analysis, simply from a musicological point of view. Note that as a pop music composer I love the entirety of the BTS and BLANKPINK catalog (even at my age, retired from the K-pop industry), which is all the more reason why I don\u2019t mind being objective with the following: Same key. Coincidentally, they\u2019re both in A minor. Whether the songs have any other similar qualities or not, it\u2019s admittedly easy for anyone\u2019s brain to latch one to this even if you\u2019re not musical, if you listen to the opening riffs of both songs back to back. But so what? The key of a piece of music determines nothing. No lie, a folk singer actually tried to sue me for a Galaxy S commercial jingle I had composed, because his song also had an acoustic guitar and was in the key of Ab. A simple analysis of both tracks provided to lawyers made it incredibly easy to defend, and the court was not amused. Lawsuit dismissed, key is never a factor.Similar tempo? Baepsae is 167 BPM (although it feels like half of that at 83.5 BPM), and Pretty Savage sits at 153 BPM or so (or half of that, if you please). Still another \u201cso what\u201d, as they\u2019re really not that close. Not a factor.Similar riff. This one actually holds water: If you just count the first two beats of the four beat riff of each (at half tempo), you might hear the same descending four notes with the same rhythm (both even start on the 2nd 8th note), indeed all the more bolstered by a similar impression if you listen to them back to back, since the A minor key will bring it all the more to mind. But from the third beat, they diverge. That\u2019s the similarity.Nothing new. The curiously exotic-sounding melody of the riff of both Baepsae and Pretty Savage descend in A minor from sol to do with a raised 4th, but in reality are both nothing new to music, being a very common melodic figure (actually, part of a common mode) in Slavonic folk music, most notably familiar in the 19th century piece Marche Slave[1] by Russian composer Tchaikovsky, a theme originally from the folk song \u201cCome, My Dearest\u201d:[2]The familiar melody is shown below in the viola part (C clef) as follows: This is all to say that the riffs of both Baepsae and Pretty Savage share a melodic mode heard in a famous work by one of the champions of 19th-century Russian Nationalism, a mode also frequently employed by (Tchaikovsky contemporary) Rimsky-Korsakov as well, in his much-loved Scheherazade.[3] Absolutely no harm done.  Conclusion: The first four notes of the melody you hear in the opening two beats of the riffs of Baepsae and Pretty Savage (1) share the same notes, (2) share the same rhythm, and (3) are in the same key. That\u2019s why they sound similar. However, both riffs are a full four beats long, and \u201csounding similar\u201d stops after just two beats. As a composer, I wouldn\u2019t draw any more conclusions beyond that, as similar melodic and rhythmic figures are not uncommon in pop music, just as no one panned George Harrison for his opening guitar riff of \u201cHere Comes the Sun\u201d, even though it seems to use the same notes as The Byrds \u201cI\u2019ll Feel a Whole Lot Better\u201d, for example. And are both in A major. Touch\u00e9, mon frere. The reason why I feel that way? Shared notes of a similar riff don\u2019t mean much if they quickly diverge, so I say no need to get hung up on the opening riff of Pretty Savage sounding like Baepsae. In other words: Four notes of the riff are the same\u2026 so what?  Question: Does the song \"Pretty Savage\" (opening beat) by BLACKPINK sound similar to \"Baepsae\" by BTS to you?

Not to mention, you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about it and whatever the producers wants to do just know it\u2019s on them and will take full responsibility if they were to have copied an artists work. But, I don\u2019t think they are that stupid to do that. ",

The songs sound different(listen to the instrumentals and you will tell the differences) The beginning beats of the songs are being compared as being \u2018\u2019similar\u2019\u2019 and it kind of is but the rest of the song is completely different from Baepsae. Anyways, everyone has their own opinion. ",

But regardless of how similar/different they sound I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with it. One group did not copy the other and hopefully no other accusations are made bc in the end I\u2019m happy for the music and hard work each group put into their songs. ",
