            "answer_text": "At different times in my teens my favorite band was Zeppelin, Yes, R.E.M., or Husker Du. Zep broke up right at the beginning of my teenagerdom due to Bonham's death at the impossibly remote and abstract age (to a teenager) of 32. While I occasionally pull up Achilles Last Stand and don't turn the radio dial if another fave shows up, I don't listen to them much. My kids did go through a time where we always had \"III\" on though. I had a temporary resurgence of interest in Yes a few years back due to a friend but I haven't really dug anything they've done since the Trevor Horne album \"Drama\" (yep, I am that guy.) I got into classical (which is what Yes points you to anyway) and that has proven to be completely satisfying to that part of me that wants heady music. R.E.M. stood out from the postpunk-MTV-hair metal crowd for me. They seemed so genuine, man! But they slowly lost me after \"Fables\" and I despised \"Green\". The first few albums still sound good but I don't seek them out. Husker Du were awesome but I think they were a mopey teenager's teenage band - very proto emo and proto grunge. I'd feel embarrassed to play them with my (teen) kids in the house. I'd feel like I was stomping on my kids' rightful turf. Some types of catharsis are best left to certain stages of our lives. ",
