            "answer_text": "The technology behind storing music (or, more precisely, sound) in the grooves of a record has been invented by Thomas Edison, some 150 years ago. Sound that we hear is essentially air that vibrates back and forth at specific frequency. Those vibrations are carried through the air to our ears. Edison devised a device which had a large brass conical horn, and at the end of that horn, he had a membrane that would vibrate from the sound that came into the horn. The membrane was attached to a sharp cutting knife, which carved a groove in a wax cylinder that was spinning at constant speed. That groove had varying depth, which corresponded to the vibrations of the knife (and the membrane, and the air that carried the sound). When the recording is done, you could simply replace the cutting knife with the playback needle, which gently fit into the groove and followed its movement and transferred those vibrations onto a membrane, which allowed those vibrations to be carried through the air. The membrane was attached to the same brass horn, which helped amplify those vibrations, which our ear hears as sound. The vinyl record and grooves on it use the same exact technology as the Edison phonograph from the 19th century, however some components are significantly better. Instead of a mechanical, passive membrane transferring movement of air into movement of a cutting knife, electrical device is used. Microphone will pick up vibrations of air, convert it into electrical impulses (changes in voltage, corresponding to movements of air back and forth), and those electrical impulses will be used to drive the cutting knife. For playback, there will be a needle (usually diamond), which will be connected mechanically to magnetic coils, much the way a membrane in a microphone is connected to a magnetic coil, so that it can generate electrical impulses. These magnetic coils will generate electricity that corresponds to the vibrations of the needle, as it travels along the groove. The electrical impulses will go to an electronic amplifier that will amplify the voltage and the power of the current and then send it to the speakers. Typical loudspeakers are very similar in design to an ordinary microphone: a membrane, physically connected to a magnetic coil. The electrical current coming out of the amplifier will go to this coil, forcing it to move back and forth, corresponding to the variations in the groove. The movements of the membrane will move air around it, generating sound you hear.  ",

            "answer_text": "They use a diamond which is vibrating in tune with the music to cut an acetate. The acetate is used to create a mold and then the mold is used to press vinyl into a duplicate of the acetate original and thus has the grooves cut into it. Then a record needle is placed into that groove and vibrates creating a duplicate of the original music. ",
