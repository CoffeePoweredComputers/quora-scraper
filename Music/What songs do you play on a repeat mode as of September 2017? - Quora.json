            "answer_text": "The song i have been listening on repeat mode as of September 2017 is this:  Ae Dil (O Heart) by Ali Zafar and Sara Haidar from Coke Studio Pakistan - Season 8. It\u2019s a beautiful track which gives a Blues/Jazz spin to an old classical masterpiece. The vocals, the musical instruments used, lyrics and the careful \u201cUp-gradation\u201d of the song; every piece collates cohesively to create a mini masterpiece(IMO). The best thing about this song is the Blues/Jazz spin that converts the original vibe of the song (which was full of pain and diminishing hope) to an uplifting celebration of solitude, experienced as a result of unrequited love. The lyrics still sound like written by a jilted lover, who can\u2019t get over his unrequited love. The energetic and celebratory tone of the singers though, makes the new version sound like an inspiringly purposeful ballad. It celebrates unrequited love and the heartbreak that comes along with it. The vibe of the song, is the content (even happy-ish) acceptance of heartbreak by a heartbroken lover. In a market filled with songs about lovers willing to die for unrequited love, and having no purpose or meaning left in life, mixed with tunes that forcefully want to make you feel sad, this song is a whiff of fresh air. Ali Zafar NEVER disappoints and Sara Haidar is a revelation. The only thing i regret is, that it came out back in 2015 and i really couldn\u2019t get a chance to hear it then. Better late than never, i guess. Thanks for A2A. Translation for lyrics: Ae Dil - Episode 4 - Season 8 - Coke Studio Pakistan ",
