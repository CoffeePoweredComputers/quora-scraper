            "answer_text": "In the 50s\u2019 we were called colored people. Colored was often taken as a slur, even when not so intended. Negro became the accepted term through most of the 60s\u2019. In the late 1960s\u2019 and early 70s\u2019, after the release of James Brown's song \u201cSay it Loud\u201d(I\u2019m Black and I\u2019m Proud\u201d) many people were encouraged to go by the term \u201cblack\u201d. Consequently, we became Black people. In the late 80s\u2019 the Rev. Jessee Jackson began referring to blacks as African American, which continues up until today. The problem with this is that all blacks are not \u201coriginally from Africa.\u201d Black American-Puerto-Ricans and Panamanians, among many others, are classified as \u201cAfrican-American\u201d under today\u2019s classification of black Americans. Some people have begun to use the term: \u201cpeople of color\u201d. It is a useful term because defining someone by a negative \u2014 nonwhite or other than white \u2014 seems silly. But some whites object to the phrase, too, because, they have no color. It is really much more complicated than it needs to be. footnote: all that I wrote came from my\u201d east coast\u201d memories from my lifetime. Please don\u2019t quote me because my memories could differ from somebody else\u2019s. ",

            "answer_text": "Why do people call black people African American? \u201cAfrican-American\u201d is a reasonably accurate and non-pejorative label for a culture. The ancestors of today\u2019s African Americans were drawn from many different groups and then deprived of their original cultures when they were kidnapped, transported, enslaved, and forced to live in communities with strangers from widely separated areas. They had to communicate with people speaking many languages and were treated by the European culture as a single cultural block, ignoring their diverse origins. In response, they quickly adopted a new language and developed a new culture mixing elements of their African cultures with their experience in the new environment. This culture was distinctly American since it arose in the United States, it was distinctly different from European American culture having its own dialect, art, music, dance, cuisine, belief structures, etc, and it was distinctly African including elements drawn from various African sources. It makes sense to call this culture African-American. And just as we identify some groups as Italian-American or Irish-American to recognize the contribution of those homelands to the culture of their American cousins, why would we not do the same for African-Americans?
