            "answer_text": "Yes. Today we tend to think of the ancient Greeks as corresponding to the modern nation state of Greece. This a massive mistake to make when discussing Classical and Medieval history. When studying history, we must be careful not to impose present circumstances onto our conception of the past. Historically until the age of the nation states, the Greeks lived all over the Mediterranean, and many of these regions were just as Greek as Athens. In 500 BC a person from a Halicarnassus in modern day Turkey would have considered himself as Greek as somebody from Athens, and the Athenian would likely have agreed with him. In the midst of the Greek golden age following the defeat of the Persian invasion, when Athens became famous for all of its philosophers, the biggest and most prosperous city-state of the Greek world was Syracuse, in Sicily. When Pyrrhus fought the Romans, he was not invading Italy, he was defending the Greeks of Magna Graecia (Great Greece) from a Roman invasion. The great father of history, Herodotus wrote his famous Histories living under the rule of the Persian Empire that he writes about so scathingly, in his native home of Halicarnassus in Asia minor. At the famous battle of Salamis, roughly half of the Persian navy came from its greek provinces in Asia minor, modern day Western Turkey. At the height of the Roman Empire the second greatest city of the Empire was the Greek city of Alexandria, in modern day Egypt. The Medieval Roman Empire which was pejoratively referred to by its Western peers as the \u201cGreek Empire\u201d had its capital at Constantinople, modern day Istanbul. Most modern day Turkish cities have their roots in Medieval Roman cities. (For those who don\u2019t know, when I say Medieval Roman, I\u2019m referring to the erroneously named Byzantine Empire). When the Turks showed up in Anatolia, it had been Greek speaking for almost 1000 years, with some regions having an even longer Greek history than that. In fact even under Turkish rule many regions remained primarily Greek. In fact Greek history in Anatolia really only ended in 1922, under the modern day Turkish Republic, when the Greek population was forced out at the conclusion of the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey (which was really more like two concurrent genocides than anything else) where the Historically Greek regions of Ionia (southwestern Anatolia), Pontus (Black Sea Coast), and Cappadocia (central Anatolia) were largely depopulated, with Istanbul also losing almost a third of its population. So it wouldn\u2019t be quite accurate to say that the Greeks lived in Turkey before the Turks arrived, but rather that before the Turks arrived Turkey was a part of Greece. ",

            "answer_text": "Describing Anatolia as a \u201chistorically gr\u2019eek land\u201d is against facts and realities, and in some cases, it is advocating the traditional \u201cMegali Idea\u201d propaganda of the modern gr\u2019eek state. The word \u201cYunan\u201d (gr\u2019eek in Turkish), was the name of the grand Persian satrapy in Western Anatolia under Darius, which was formed by Caria, Lycia and Pamphylia. These regions had never been \u201cgr\u2019eek\u201d in the classical meaning. Another point is that the word \u201cgr\u2019eek\u201d was not coined until the Roman conquest. That\u2019s why, the Hellenes who did not survive this conquest, not the so-called \u201cancient gr\u2019eeks\u201d, established colonies on the coastal parts of Morea and Aegean as three tribes : \u201cDorians, Ionians and Aeolians\u201d. The Thracians, who originated in Europe and inhabited Bithynia in the north and Nicaea (today\u2019s Iznik), resisted against the presence of these colonies. In the south, Caria was the continuation of Lydia. Carians and Lycians emerged as seperate ethnos following the dissolution of Lydia and these populations were certainly \u201canti-Gr\u2019eek\u201d. In the north, there was once again, the \u201canti-Gr\u2019eek\u201d Troy against Ionians and Aeolians. The other major ethnic groups were the Celtic-origined Galatians, and the Phrygians who migrated together with Thracians via Thrace region. Following the Macedonian conquest of Athens, the vast majority of Hellenes completely left the region. They were either sent into exile by Alexander, or began to serve as mercenaries under Persian rule. The fact is that the Persians did not launch a military campaign from Iran during their wars with Hellenes. Instead, the movement of Persian army started from the Aegean coast and resulted with the conquests of Peloponnese and Thessaly. Which confirms that regions such as Caria, Cilicia, Cappadocia and Bithynia, including the ancient kingdom of Pontus, were Persian satrapies as a whole. The usage of gr\u2019eek language in Anatolia was the result of the success of trade colonies. After the Roman conquest, Anatolia became a completely Latin-speaking region. Constantinople was established during this period as well. The Romans united the multi-ethnic structure and \u201canti-Gr\u2019eek\u201d folks of Anatolia under the roof of Christianity. Thus, a new \u201cRoman (Rum)\u201d ethnos emerged. The fact of Alexander speaking the language of ancient Hellenes does not \u201cHellenize\u201d these folks. In other words, the ethnic \u201cgr\u2019eek\u201d presence in the region came to an end during the era of Roman dominance. The \u201cAnatolian gr\u2019eek\u201d identity was based on religion. The Gr\u2019eek-speaking subjects of the Eastern Roman Empire managed to unite due to Orthodoxy. A historical \u201cgr\u2019eek\u201d identity in terms of a nation and demographic dominance never existed in Anatolia in any period of history. ",

There are around 70 ethnic roots here but majority if not all call themselves Turks for the sake of unification and protection. If you check DNA studies most of them carry ancient Anatolian genes thousand of years older than Greek colonies. So the answer to your question is : no because majority of todays Turks are older than Greeks since they are also descendants of ancient anatolians (hittites, Phrygs, Lydia. etc.) ",

These people were not exactly Greeks, although they DID come from Greece, about 1000 BC. Their revolts around 500 BC spawned what became the Greco-Persian Wars, which included Marathon, Thermopylae, and Salamis. I may be wrong but I believe the Turks first made an appearance in this area around 400\u2013500 AD. ",
