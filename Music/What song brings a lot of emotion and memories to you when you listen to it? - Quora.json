            "answer_text": "My family immigrated to the U.S. carrying three suitcases and a duffel bag. With only the belongings in those few pieces of luggage, we would start a new life. The suitcases were packed to the brim with necessities, mostly clothing. There were a few sentimentals and valuables, but we had to leave most of our things behind. Being children, my older sister and I saw it as a great adventure. It wasn\u2019t until years later that I missed some of the things we left in Hong Kong. Or understood how hard it must have been for my parents to leave the life they had built together in their first nine years of marriage. Among all the necessities, there was one luxury Mom took with us. A record player. Along with it, she packed ten or so of the records that our family owned. Even though we missed the toys we left behind, my sister and I never lacked for entertainment. We had the cartoons and sitcoms on the black and white TV that a family friend donated to us. We had a whole fantasy world through books from school and the local public library. But for my parents, who didn\u2019t speak English, the only entertainment and culture they had for those first years was through the record player. During hard times, Mom would sometimes be melancholy. During those times, Mom would bring out the record player and put on one of the records. Chinese operas. Old Chinese pop songs. Chinese musical skits. Mom\u2019s spirits would improve with each turn on the record player. During happy times, when Mom was in high spirits, Mom didn\u2019t need the record player. Instead, she would sing. Mom sang many songs, but there was one song that she always sang \u2014 the Song of Four Seasons. Although we didn\u2019t have a recording of it, it was my favorite song. It made me happy, because every time I heard it, it meant Mom was happy. The summer before I started high school, my mom and I visited her childhood home in China, where my grandma had retired to after my grandpa passed away. Mom wanted to take some gifts with us for Grandma, but we had little money, and Mom wasn\u2019t able to buy much to bring. So Mom decided to take her most prized possession, the record player and records, as a gift to Grandma. A week or two after we returned from our trip, Mom seemed a bit sad. \u201cWe can\u2019t play records anymore.\u201d My sister reflected ruefully. My mom heard my sister\u2019s comment, and stood up. She straightened herself, took a deep breath, and started singing my favorite song. The Song of Four Seasons. A song of happy times. A song of bittersweet times. A song of love. It was the song of my mother.  My favorite photo of my mom, taken before she was married  ",

            "answer_text": "There are quite a few songs in my playlist that are actually my gateway into the past, my nostalgic trance. Each time the playlist shuffles to some of these songs, it reminds of people who once recommended them or with whom I somehow feel connected through these songs. Although I've almost forgotten their faces but some memories remain, certain scenes are still vivid till date. The one that's left a mark and I feel it's gonna last is undoubtedly Cough Syrup by Young The Giant. The song itself doesn't have a musical or lyrical finesse to it from get-go. But it sinks in, and sinks rather deep. The title itself is a metaphor. The bitter realities of life that make you just like the healing touch of the bitter cough syrup as it goes down the throat. Then there is depression, desperation, struggle etc etc. For me it's an embodiment of many emotions and some painful memories too. The person who suggested this to me is far gone into a different world. It happened shortly after and so the obvious irony lies in opening verse of the song itself: Life's too short to even care at all I'm losing my mind losing my mind losing control.. If Iam high, it brings a tear too.. It was just a casual friendship. We shared some thoughts, couple of songs and a movie date (not a date actually). Was over in snap, life moved on. Some years later I heard she is no more. How I found about her demise is another tragic story, won't go into that though. Back where I come from (small town clich\u00e9) I've witnessed alcohol and drug abuse. The Cough Syrup association there is pretty saddening. There's lot more than delinquency and/or depression to it. Used to be a popular one-shot drink among many young lads. Enough said I guess, time to drift away. Closing this with the end verse of the song: And so I run to the things they said could restore me Restore life the way it should be I'm waiting for this cough syrup to come down One more spoon of cough syrup now whoa Stay away from depression and drugs! \u270c ",
