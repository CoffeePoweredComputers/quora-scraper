            "answer_text": "I think it depends on which phase of John that we are talking about. Early John (1962\u20131965) was an incredibly sarcastic person. While he was witty, he also had a dark side, what with beating his wife Cynthia and mocking cripples and people with disabilities on stage. This version of John would most likely make fun of the coronavirus pandemic, cracking jokes and making sarcastic comments in interviews. Revolutionary John (1966\u20131969) was John through the experimental phases (for lack of a better term) of the Beatles. This is around the time of Sgt. Pepper up until Abbey Road, when the Beatles pushed the boundaries of popular music. During this time John began using more and more psychedelic and hallucinatory drugs like LSD. So, I assume he would interpret the coronavirus pandemic as a conspiracy launched by the Chinese government to achieve world domination. Post-Beatles John (1970-\u2026) is what I like to think of as \u2018Imagine John\u2019, when he was a living representation of his song \u2018Imagine\u2019 - A kind, authentic person who cared about people. (I am just assuming this. I don\u2019t pay much attention to the members of the Beatles, their lives and their careers after the Beatles broke up). I think that this version of John would probably set up a fund for coronavirus victims or advocate staying at home. This is just my opinion and I hope you liked it! ",

            "answer_text": "Lennon was a realist and spoke it the way it is so I believe he would state that the Chinese Communist government did a terrorist act infesting the world with the virus which I too agree is the reality of the situation. The Chinese government is pure evil in it's goals and ideologies of world domination which will not be achieved and backfire on them horribly bankrupting their economy. ",
