            "answer_text": "I remember the moment exactly. I was nearly fifteen, and was in the garage hitting a few pool balls around. There was a record player and three records on the bench, and I thought I might put some music on. At this stage I didn\u2019t really listen to modern music, preferring classical and ragtime (I was a quiet little nerd), and the three albums were not familiar to me. One was Slade Alive, another was Master Of Reality (Black Sabbath), and the third had a picture of Mount Rushmore on the cover, with the faces changed to look like the band members. This was the one I decided to put on, so put the stylus in the groove and turned back to the pool table. The album was Deep Purple In Rock, and the track was Flight Of The Rat. When that guitar riff blasted out of the speakers for the first time, something fundamental changed in me. Maybe the hormone fairy chose that moment to visit, but all of a sudden I felt a surge of a feeling that I hadn\u2019t felt before, and I was transfixed. Within a month I had bought my first guitar (I had played piano, clarinet and ukulele to this point) and within three years was playing professionally. Guitar and music had become my obsession, and I simply lost interest in everything else. I am now 56, and still get a buzz from picking up a guitar and making music. ",

She taught me three chords and I taught myself the rest. I started playing in bands at the age of 16 and was signed to Columbia Records at the age of 22. Now I\u2019m signed to Elppa Records/SUGO Music Group(Sony). I still think of myself as a musician. I\u2019m a singer-songwriter. ",
