Music Users | BMI.com For that fee, the station and its programs can play the songs that org represents and the org uses the fee money they collect to pay the artists (the composers and song writers). How does the org know what every program on every radio station has played so that they pay each artist the right amount of money? That is controversial, but that is another story. ",
