            "answer_text": "If something floats into your mind, it's \"How fast can I get this on paper or into a recording before I forget it.\" One of Prince's wives said that sometimes he would jump up in the middle of a meal at a restaurant and head for Paisley to get it down. She didn't like it, but she understood.I have one composer friend who works in colors. He was nominated for a national Emmy as an editor anyway, so he thinks in in terms of story and drama before colors.On the other hand, I recall being in composition classes in college and thinking, \"Damn it! I need to get something on paper before tomorrow morning\" while I stared blankly at the keyboard. It can be like writer's block.What you think that you're best at influences your writing process. I am a better lyricist, so I tend to write those first. Some people will be wandering around playing chord progressions (I used to do that). Something would make sense and I would follow it down the rabbit hole. Other people will hear a snippet of a commercial, isolate one small part and imagine it into something different and better.Composer Paul Williams had scored a few seconds for a TV commercial for Crocker Bank in the late 1960's or early 70's. The theme was about a couple getting married and just beginning their life. Richard Carpenter heard the commercial and eventually found Paul. He asked Paul if he had written the rest of it. Paul, being no fool, but having written nothing further, said \"yes, of course\". Richard asked Paul to bring it to A&M Records the next day. Paul panicked, but got most of it done. \"We've Only Just Begun\" became a huge hit for the Carpenters. Pressure is a powerful motivator. \"Make it work!\"I've known people who could sit and listen to whole symphonic works in their head. Some could recall them long enough to write them down and others, who knew very little about music, just enjoyed the experience.There is usually a target. In the old days, only two groups of people had real money to pay you, \"the Crown\" and \"the Church\". So you had a patron, The Duke of Upper Slobovia. You knew what he likes to hear and you give him a variation that's juicier than your last composition for him. That sort of thing will keep him coming back for more. How about some Music for the Royal Fireworks? Ok.The church wants something new for Easter. You know the story, but you create the music in a different way, perhaps building on your previous work or something you heard a different composer do. Composer love to steal, I mean \"be influenced by\" the works of others. Listen to Star Wars, then something by Korngold, then something by a composer of the Romantic era. Hmm.There were street musicians. They are closest to today's internet market. You walked into the bazaar and started entertaining the crowd. You knew the kind of thing that a bazaar crowd liked to hear. If you were right, you got a few pennies, just like today.Have you ever heard music that seems to drone on forever? You think that they must know something deep that you don't understand. In my experience, probably not. You know people who love to hear themselves talk? t's about the same. They're just arrogant and wandering. Classical music tends to take the form of \"exhibition, development and recapitulation.\" Some famous composers \"live\" in development.In an interview after a few albums, Pete Townshend, primary composer for The Who was asked if he was ready to do another album. He said, \"I don't think that I have enough arrogance left to do another one.\"Many times, especially if you had a multi-album deal to complete for your record label, that's what it became. \"I going to write whatever I damn well feel like and if they don't like it, too bad.\"One time I was in the recording studio (I wasn't playing, just visiting) with the drummer from Supertramp. I don't recall which song it was that he showed me, but composer had taken a roll of paper (like toilet paper) and written the whole song on a continuous sheet of paper that went on and on and on. (It may have been The Logical Song and they may not have used everything.) Anyway they had stapled the whole thing it to the walls near the ceiling all around the room. Stoned? Just in a groove? I don't know. Sometimes it just flows.Neil Young would sometimes write enough for 40 songs and then edit it down to one song that he approved of. For \"For What It's Worth\", as I recall, he took some wrapping paper out of the garbage and got it written down the first time, in Magic Marker in the bathroom.Composers don't know where the music comes from. Some composers have a formulaic method that works for them. Others hear it from somewhere.As an around the room tidbit...I was on the set for Star Trek Next Gen and the words around the ceiling of the bridge are the words to the theme from Gilligan's Island. The prop people need something. That works. ",

            "answer_text": "When I create music the process is usually entangled with all sorts of thoughts revolving around my music. I have an idea rolling over and over in my head and I'm trying to get it all out which often leads to very rough-sketchy orchestrations as I try to map everything out as it is in my head. Meanwhile I have little tangents running off as I compose, sometimes these tangents are a product of my composing and spring up on a new idea. Sometimes they get reserved for a new song all on their own but at first it gets piled into one song. All the time I'm laying down music and suddenly thinking 'oh wait, this would be really good in Phrygian mode' or suddenly wanting to write a really lively staccato section because I just had the idea in my head. Sometimes I'm coming up with things that will happen in my composition such as key changes, form, structure and so on which will be mapped out and sometimes thinking of cool connections to make from one part to the next or thinking this certain bit might actually be really clever and allow me to put a Neapolitan 6th chord in to transition moods. It starts off as something small but the process becomes more and more erratic  - almost a battle between  my own writing speed and my own thinking speed. Almost certainly structuring a composition comes later if needed although unlike some composers I like to try and get the whole thing done from start to finish without the need for many edits first time. I start from the beginning and work my way to the end and intend to have it completed when I reach the end - as opposed to writing music and then structuring it later. I try to leave as little editing as possible. Nothing else flows through my head over than the idea I am working on as well as future ideas and techniques I could implement - all of these are usually triggered as I compose. Also, I get very moody if you disrupt my flow man, you dig me? ",
