            "answer_text": "Maybe it had nothing to do with some sort of mechanical intelligence. Have you ever wondered about how much of what we know today was brought about by a perceived accident? Imagine a different place and a different time, the weather is cooler and folks are wearing animal hides. A few of them are out looking for something to eat. Somebody dragging their feet kicked the right 2 stones and saw a spark. This foot dragging individual not only discovered the source for starting fire. He noticed when the rocks were rolling together a defining rhythm was repeating for just a few seconds. We\u2019ve long since lost his name, but this fellow that was constantly harped at for dragging his feet. Well, that foot dragging bastard became a hero to his tribe for discovering fire and Rock n Roll! Just something to think about! it could\u2019ve just as easily been an accident of sorts. I heard he went from dragging his feet to stomping them when the rocks were rolled right! Ponder on that for a while. Thanks! Robert ",

            "answer_text": "Well the question is more about societies that are able to produce historically important music. What I mean when I say great music (and musicians) is a music which is at the same time revolutionary for it's region at least, long lasting (stays actual and alive for society even after becoming centuries old) and touches a maximum number of different people. The question comes mainly from the observation that even though each country/region may have already produced such music it doesn't mean that it is a continuous production through time . My assumption is that it doesn't only depend on isolated geniuses or pure chance but also on some history, readiness, social, cultural and economic parameters for example. One example I may be able to speak about could be the arab/islamic world\u2019s musical production that knew some golden ages and some very poor ages. Some golden ages don't even depend on recordings or musical writing as people do learn and pass the music from a generation to another through simply playing and singing it . What I am interested in is not if there is everywhere at anytime people who produce incredible music , which is, I think, by the way, difficult to prove but how some music gets to be aknowledged and to have a long lasting impact on a society and on music history and regional or global culture. Is there any knowledge about that? ",
