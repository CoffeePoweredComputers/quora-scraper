            "answer_text": "Because rightsholders are taking notice. YouTube was the biggest platform for sharing videos, but Facebook actually beats it by a fairly narrow margin. Unfortunately for rightsholders, they have far less quality control because they\u2019re a social platform first and a video sharing site second. They don\u2019t have YouTube\u2019s almighty algorithm and bots and whatnot to scour the billions of bytes on a near-instantaneous basis. Say what you will about false copyright claims & unwarranted account strikes, at least there is a system to fix in case things go sour. Facebook is a dinosaur by comparison, and Instagram is one of its eggs. They don\u2019t have the mechanism in place to meet rightsholders halfway, like when YouTube used to mute your video or divert ad revenue or (sometimes/once upon a time) allow the video to remain up but with a link to buy the song through Amazon or iTunes added to the description. It\u2019s no skin off Facetagram\u2019s nose if a record company comes-a-knockin\u2019 for them to just flush the stash down the toilet and say, \u201cWhat infringement?\u201d. There\u2019s less red tape for everyone involved, and the only people getting the short end of the stick are nobodies looking for their 15 minutes in the sun by taking the easy way (no offense, I\u2019m sure you work hard on your videos; you could probably just stand to give it an extra 10%). You have options: simplest, maybe not easiest: make your own music. Learn an instrument, be it a piano or a theremin or a drumpad app on your iPad. Take those singing lessons you\u2019ve always secretly wanted to. Get some friends to help you out; everyone knows someone who\u2019s in a band.simplest, somewhat easier: invest in some royalty-free tracks. YouTube has an entire audio library of downloadable tracks you can use just about anywhere (not exclusively YouTube, though check each track\u2019s individual license terms). There\u2019s whole sets of free-to-use discs out there that may seem costly upfront, but bear in mind you can use the tracks any which way you want. It\u2019s as valid an expense as anything else you\u2019d use to produce a video.simplest & easiest: don\u2019t have music in your videos, hit that mute button before you upload. If your video is interesting enough, it won\u2019t need the sound.",

            "answer_text": "You are asking a lot of questions here. The one that really seems to be the core of your concern is \u201cWhy is Instagram inconsistent in applying their copyright controls to infringing videos?\u201d The answer to that will never be satisfactory, because there are a ton of factors, some of which Instagram cannot control. You\u2019ll just have to accept that they are inconsistent. But as for why they deleted all of your videos, I think you already know why. You were using music made by someone else and your videos were infringing on copyright. As for the timing, be aware that as new platforms add video, that makes for more work for the music publishers in tracking down use of their music and having it removed. You say \u201cInstagram never used to do this\u2026\u201d, but sort of ignore that they eventually would as the music publishers find their songs on Instagram\u2019s website. Instagram has no choice here, if they don\u2019t remove the videos, they get sued by the music companies for millions. You cannot legally use someone else\u2019s music. Come on, you already know that! I really don\u2019t think you are complaining about \u201cHey, get this other guy too!\u201d You are really complaining that you got caught and suffered a very small penalty. ",
