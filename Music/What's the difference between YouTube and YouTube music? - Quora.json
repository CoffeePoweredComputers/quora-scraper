            "answer_text": "YouTube The app focuses almost entirely on subscriptions and suggestions. The more you watch, the more recommendations you'll get for relevant or related videos YouTube thinks you'll like. If you're subscribed to a channel, updates and new uploads appear in a dedicated tab, where you can easily keep up with your favorite YouTube creators and personalities.  You likely know all about YouTube, the online hosting site with millions of videos of all stripes. The YouTube app lets you watch these videos away from a computer on your phone, tablet or TV. Many e-commerce websites are also helpful for digital downloads. YouTube Music The app is divided into three tabs for recommended videos, \"YouTube Music today\" and the videos you've liked. \"YouTube Music today\" is a really neat space that shows themed playlists of popular music, internationally trending songs and albums, eye-grabbing videos and more. YouTube Music also includes radio stations of music based on a particular artist or song, similar to Pandora. You can control how much variety you'll hear for any given station with a slider that controls the tunes. The app pays attention to your musical tastes to make suggestions and fine-tune your stations automatically.  Even with YouTube Music, Google Play Music is still available. YouTube Music isn't out to replace it. Instead, the two services will complement each other. If you already subscribe to Google Play Music, then you automatically get YouTube Music Premium as part of your package, and the price you pay will remain the same. One can listen and then Sell your music online anytime This means you will also still have access to any songs you've purchased and any you've stored in the cloud for listening on other devices. ",
