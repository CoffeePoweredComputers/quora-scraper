            "answer_text": "In a situation like this, one has to act in a mature manner. First of all you need to listen to them, what their point of view in the given situation is. After they are done with their part, ask them to calm down first, if they're still not ready to listen to you.. Wait till they have finished with whatever they are willing to say, wait for them till they're finally done and quiet. Then ask them politely to listen to you and keep your point of view in that matter. After all it's your right to say whatever you have in store for them. Start very politely, and express your feelings step by step, in a systematic manner which could make sense as soon as you put out the explanation. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no wisdom or sense in talking to people who just hear you out and not listen .When you say something you have the right to be listened to not just with the ear terminating at the ear drum ,but percolating into the mind ,the intellect ,emotions,and absorbing the contents respectfully ,and responding . The only wall that prevents people from listening is the inflated ego ,ignorance and arrogance fueled by low self esteem ,and false sense of self importance and pride ,that comes from the hollowness and critical attitude within. If you continue to speak even when the guy is merely hearing superficially and not listening with his mind and heart ,then you are flaming his ego and arrogance more ,and making them look at you disdainfully ,with the nose up ,proudly ,and you are just making a fool of yourself .Like the scriptures tell that it is better not to talk to a proud fool if you don t want to be one like him .Ignore them leave them to their brilliance and self opinionatedness ,and self -absorbtion ,some people by their zodiac natures don t like to be told what to do a or adviced.Politely ignore them and do something more important and satisfying.
