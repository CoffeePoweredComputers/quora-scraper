            "answer_text": "Very tough to answer. While I am not saying there is a genetic reason why people like the things that they do, I think everyone has their own unique organisation of their aesthetic sense. Sometimes that might be in line with other people. But sometimes, people who like many of the same songs, find a particular song that one loves and the other hates. I was brought up by parents who were classical musicians, and did not listen to pop music until I rebelled at 13 and switched on the radio (the earliest song I remember was Cyndi Lauper's Time After Time). However, over 30 years later my preferred genres include crunchy guitars and a melodic, singable vocal. But via my (awfully useful) Performing Arts degree I learned not to be snobbish about genre. There are songs I like that fall into genres like dance, pop, rap, grime, and even country and western. If you limit what you listen to you based on artist or genre, you are closing yourself to music that can reach different parts of your soul. I don't ask myself why I like Whigfield's Another Day any more than I do Evanescence, Nickelback, Inferno or Queen\u2026 I just do, and enjoy them all. I don't believe I have good music taste\u2026 I don't believe anyone has, everyone just likes what they like. What amuses me are the people that drive their cars with windows open and loud music, or walk with their phones tinnily blasting out their favourite sounds, or even a guy that sometimes passes me in London as I walk to work who has fitted an amplifier and speakers to his bicycle\u2026 all of them are boasting to the world that they are listening to the best and coolest music, but in reality I am guessing that the large majority of people hearing it think it is banal and really a bit rubbish. I therefore make a personal choice not to inflict my own rubbish taste in music on those in my vicinity :) ",

            "answer_text": "I think that this has much to do with peoples life experiences and possibly even their own personalities. For example, the band Korn is a nu metal band which makes lots of music based on the extreme feelings and emotions one has when being hurt by other people or suffering from mental illnesses or disorders. They have made songs based on the experience of being bullied, raped, abused, and many other sobering topics. Much of their songs were about real experiences that the lead singer had when he was young. When I first started listening to their music it was shocking to hear how angry, emotional, and depressing it was. There\u2019s a lot of unusual vocals along with some extreme moments of screaming and crying. Though this type of music is very disturbing and not to many peoples tastes, I was pleasantly surprised when I learned the reason why many fans of Korn became attached to their music. Many people who have said to like Korn\u2019s music have often gone through those terrifying experiences that their songs are about. Many of them have also said to experience the feeling of not being alone in their struggles when listening to Korn because the music is reflecting how they feel. Though what I just stated doesn\u2019t describe all Korn fans, this is what I often hear from people who love their music. For me, I find it interesting how peoples life experiences can impact their ability to understand certain types of music. There\u2019s a lot of people who have a great dislike for nu metal because they think its too whiny or sung in an weird way. They probably think that way because they can\u2019t grasp the reason why nu metal sounds that way. Another example I\u2019d like to discuss is the genre of death metal. Many people don\u2019t like death metal because the vocals are really gruff and hard to understand and the music is too violent and extreme. Even though I didn\u2019t start out liking death metal, I grew to have a taste for it as I got older. Death metal often has some awesomely complex guitar playing. It also has some of the most insanely fast drumming I have ever heard. Though the lyrics are usually violent and death related, everything that is sung is just theatrical and fictional. Even though there has always been a lot of speculation that this type of music encourages violence, many people who enjoy death metal listen to it because it helps them release their stress, not amplify it. In conclusion, I think people like different songs or types of music because they understand or don\u2019t understand why certain types of music are the way they are. ",
