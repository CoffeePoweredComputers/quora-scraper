            "answer_text": "No one can actually tell you this. We can answer what has the best reviews or the most purchases or the best measured properties of this and that\u2026 \u2026but you can pull all that stuff up on Google. But it\u2019s going to come down to your personal needs and preferences. For example, I have a need for long charge lasting and a sort of specific tuning in the midrange for me to really be able to hear the music best to my taste because I have hearing damage. So I work around that to find the right ones. The next person may need something with more bass or more treble or a thinner sound or a thicker sound, and so on, to hit their ears and brain to sound right/best. And things like ear fit and charge lasting, especially ear fit, are up to you for your needs, too. I can suggest the best pair for me so far, so much so that I\u2019ve two pair so that I can always switch them if one loses its charge while I need it - but it\u2019s never happened yet after about a year of owning one and then two. They are said to last 30 hours per charging, but I can\u2019t make any claim to that being specifically correct. But I\u2019ve never had them run out due to listening to things for hours. The only time they have gone empty is when I\u2019ve forgotten to turn them off and they spend the day in my bag or something just on and losing power. In use they seem to last forever lol. Their ear pierces are great for me because I find the kind that wrap around your ears to be either painful or don\u2019t stay on because my ears are pointed. This is not a problem most people run into, but even without pointing it can be the case. I also can\u2019t usually wear the type that are squishy and just fit in your ear canal because no matter what size squishy bit, despite everyone saying that works, they fall out easily whenever I\u2019m moving about. The have not only the big that goes into your ear canal but a firm but flexible curved part that comes up and fits inside and covers the entire first inner curve of your ear. This tends to hold them in place very well and also helps with outside noise reduction. They are bluetooth but they are wired together, some folks don\u2019t like that in their headphones when they are bluetooth.. This clearly doesn\u2019t apply if you get wired-connected headphones to begin with. And last, as said, for me the sound is excellent. I\u2019m very happy with it. But you may not be. I can\u2019t really say that they\u2019d sound best to you or even very good. The tuning of them works for my hearing needs just great. Your hearing is going to be different so whether or not they are excellent to you is going to be just an individual thing. So, all that said, I can tell you what pair so far have been the best in my personal opinion. I gather some info from reviews and specs of them before I buy, but that is the stuff you can Google and find out what generally is rated the best. Since you can just Google all of those sort of \u201cwhich is the best\u201d sort of thing I gave you a personal perspective instead. The ones I like are TaoTronics TT-BH076 Bluetooth headphones. ",

            "answer_text": "When you\u2019re selecting a True wireless earphone there are a few things to look for 1. The first among them is the battery life of your earphone, always choose better battery backup ones and check if they tag along with a compact charging case like Zeb-Bomb or else you\u2019ll have good music but need to keep charging frequently and that\u2019s definitely not something you\u2019d like to do. 2. Second should be the sound quality of the earphone. I\u2019d actually ask you to test these out or look out for ample reviews online before you buy/order it. It should be comfortable on the ears 3. Third would be charging time; TWS earphones should come with an on the go charging case that helps you charge immediately or you can opt for wireless earphones like Zeb-Lark has fast charge so you can charge your earphone in under 10 minutes that will last you for 2 hours. Look for rapid charge wireless earphones. 4. Dual Pairing is another aspect you can look at if you can remain paired with your laptop and your phone it\u2019s going to make a difference rather than connecting it individually every time. 5. Touch controls/ Buttons: You have to choose which one you like best. Other features like Volume controls and voice assistant most TWS should have these, so that\u2019s another thing you can check. 6. If you\u2019re buying it for sports/workout also check out for water resistance which will help you These are a few of my suggestions, hope they help. ",
