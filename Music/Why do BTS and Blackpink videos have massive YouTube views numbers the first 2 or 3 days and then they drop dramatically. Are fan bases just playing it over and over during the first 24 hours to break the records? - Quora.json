            "answer_text": "Yes, of course. Just look at the comments on the videos, 90% of them are about mass streaming. Kind of a shame because we\u2019ll never have a real idea what the organic interest level is, but it is what it is. Just don\u2019t take the view counts too seriously. I\u2019ve said it before but what really matters is weight classes. A video with 100m views represents something different than one with 10m views, but say 100m vs 120m? Meh. Why do this? For bragging rights and publicity. The whole thing was started by one guy tracking records on OneHallyu a few years ago, and it\u2019s grown and mutated into something pretty silly and occasionally unhealthy (if people are spending actual money on it.) I was hoping the fan community was starting to get over it\u2026 but now the mainstream media is unhelpfully reporting on this like it matters. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course. You do realize that it's a cat and dog race where one fandom is competing against another to gain the top spot which here is the title of the most viewed mv in first 24 hours. It's physically impossible for a music video to gain views as much as 60 million in a day unless there's some mass streaming going on( there are exceptions too). Some fans who are wealthy enough just rent an entire cyber cafe to stream an mv all day long. Some quit rest and eating just to stream the videos over and over again. Once they've got the title, they'll stop streaming like crazy and maybe just watch it once a day. ",
