            "answer_text": "Well, you will need at least SOME equipment, a camera!You can create a great webseries by shooting it on your phone! If you have an iPhone, use it horizontally to shoot your scenes, then download iMovie for about $10 to edit it, all on your phone. Then upload to Youtube, start promoting it to your social networks, and ask all your friends to watch and share! If you can access any editing software because you don't have an i phone, use your phones camera and shoot it continuously, then upload it to Youtube . If you don't have a smartphone or camera, try borrowing a friends or renting it for a few hours or trading some skill for use of the camera. You can also use your laptop's camera to shoot it, editing it on iMovie (free on mac books) or finding some software (sometimes free) online. Youtube is the best place to post and start the views, make sure you use hashtags (#) on social media to promote it, and get your friends to act in it. You don't have to spend any money besides the camera and editing software, and even that you can find for free or very cheap on eBay. Create, go for it, remember most people want a great and interesting storytelling over camera quality, so make sure your concept is solid and rehearsed before you start shooting. Google and read all you can on creating a webseries and filming, and good luck! ",
