            "answer_text": "There was an interview in the late 70s where Dylan was asked about Norman Raeben, the old man who taught art in NYC, dylan and sara and family were living in Malibu then i think, in CA, and he had gotten interested in Raeben, heard about it from a friend of Sara\u2019s who came to their house, according to his story, and he said that the thing he learned about painting from Raeben, it wasn\u2019t mainly about painting, it was about life and how to see, and he would go to study with Raeben every day and he said he was learning things about how to stop time, and how to create art that contained past present and future all together at once, which he said meant stopping time, and he said in the early and mid 60s the songs that were pouring out of him had that quality of immediacy without him trying, it just happened, and then he lost that ability. from Raeben he learned how to do it consciously or purposefully and he credited that influence for the songs on Blood on the Tracks and Street Legal. i\u2019m not sure if it was the same interview or another one (i read it quoted in wikipedia article about him), he said after he went to study art/life with Raeben, when he came home, his wife never understood him after that, he was not able to communicate with her.

            "answer_text": "This is prying into two people\u2019s personal lives but we can have an educated guess. It is fair to say that Dylan had many affairs during their time together. It is also fair to say that he is a difficult person to be around - read Howard Sounes\u2019 biography or Victor Maimudes\u2019 (and his son\u2019s) book. He is very selfish, frequently petulant and acts like a spoilt brat a lot - like a lot of famous people. Sara may have called time on this behaviour. The thing that probably capped it all for Sara was Bob releasing the album \u2018Blood on the Tracks\u2019 which lifts the lid on their troubled marriage in a raw and shocking way. Give it a listen. After having intimate details of your married life aired on record and on stage, divorce would be most ladies\u2019 next step. ",
