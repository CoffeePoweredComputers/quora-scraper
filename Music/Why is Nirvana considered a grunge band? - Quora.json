            "answer_text": "Grunge (sometimes referred to as the Seattle sound) is a subgenre of alternative rock and a subculture that emerged during the mid-1980s in the Pacific Northwest U.S. state of Washington, particularly in Seattle and nearby towns. NIRVANA was not a grunge band but punk as Kurt had said. He disliked the term \u2018grunge\u2019 which was mislabelled by the journalists who could not give a suitable name to the sudden surge of new music particularly in Seattle. This common misconception made the Seattle sound as grunge which we know today. ",

            "answer_text": "Grunge to me never implied the flashier chops or arena-rock gestures of bands like Soundgarden or Pearl Jam. I always thought the true \"godfathers of grunge\" were Husker Du, who are best remembered for their punchy, distorted, emotionally direct, mid tempo songs that were essentially pop in nature. Basically, what Nirvana did. ",
