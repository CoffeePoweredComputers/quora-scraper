            "answer_text": "Honestly bro, practice makes perfect. Just keep going and don\u2019t stop. A word of advice tho, when writing a song and trying to have a fast flow, use words that have multiple syllables and roll off the tounge very easily. Being able to rap hella fast is tricky when you\u2019re using words that are hard for you to utter. You\u2019ll often find yourself slurring your words or running out of breath on a certain word. Focus on that word and try to change it with something that has equal or more syllables or just practice saying that word by itself. Best of luck! ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure, my best advice would be to work your way up. From listening to so much rap I would say less words more syllables makes the SPS higher. But if you want it to sound really fast less syllables more words. And to be honest you do not need to go faster, for some perspective the fastest ski mask verses are 8 syllables per second, and on rap god Eminem barley hit 10 syllables per second. I think you are just fine at 12. I think you are defiantly counting wrong because listen to twisted insane Brainsick 1.0 he barely hits 12 SPS so I have no idea why you would want to go faster. ",
