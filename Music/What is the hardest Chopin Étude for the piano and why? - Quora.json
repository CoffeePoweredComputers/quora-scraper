            "answer_text": "I've listened and studied all 24 of his Etudes for quite awhile. There are a few that stand out from the rest in term of difficulty: Etude Op. 25, No. 6 in G-sharp minor \"Double Thirds\". This one is really a b*tch to me. Being able to play double thirds trill at that speed with chromatics run on the right hand, jumps on the left hand and the volume of the notes are just a few technical aspect of this piece. To be able to cleanly execute it is a completely different question.Etude Op. 10, No. 2 in A minor \"Chromatique\". This one is the one i've spent the most effort out of all the Etudes yet the shortest piece in term of duration. The high speed chromatic run on the right hand depends on the weak \"outer\" fingers combined with the chords are very hard to do. Additionally, there are jumps on the left hand that are quite hard to voice due to the sheer notes being play by the right hand. The Winter Wind Etude has the same voicing challenge.Etude Op. 10, No. 1 in C Major. Many people considered this the hardest Etude while most would definitely rank it as among the hardest. It feels like Mozart's music. It's very hard to hide a wrong note or eliminate a note that you can't play. The arpeggios also get tiring very quickly due to the wide span of playing from one side of the keyboard to another in fast tempo. ",

            "answer_text": "So far I've learned and performed 12 of the Chopin \u00e9tudes, and I've always thought without exception that Op.10 No.1 was the most unforgiving to perform, even more so than Op.25 No.11 (Winter Wind) and Op.10 No.4, both of which are arguably more \"note-y\". The reason is because it's just so darn transparent. In Op.10 No.1, there's simply no where to hide - wrong notes stick out like sore thumbs, and every note is essential. Omitting even one note anywhere in the piece results in a glaringly conspicuous hiccup in the cascading texture. And the effect of a wrong note is even worse, as it is horrendously amplified over multiple measures due to the arpeggio-like nature of the piece. By contrast, \u00e9tudes like the Winter Wind are more easily fudged. You can definitely get away with more than a handful of wrong notes, and even omitting notes is probably not easily detected, except to those intimately familiar with the piece. In this respect, they are actually much more forgiving to the performer. Here is what I consider to be one of the very best performances of Op.10 No.1. The clarity and lightness of touch are just phenomenal:   ",
