            "answer_text": "I learned to play when I was about 10 and played pretty regularly for about 25 years. As reeded wind instruments go, it\u2019s not too bad. You can make roughly melodic noises with it on your initial encounter, and the curve from there to \u201crecognizable music\u201d isn\u2019t terribly steep. However, if you\u2019re thinking you\u2019re going to turn into Wayne Shorter in a couple of lessons, dream on. That\u2019s a whole \u2018nother thing. (If you think you\u2019re going to turn into Kenny G, please, just stop reading now, you\u2019re in the wrong place) I\u2019d recommend starting with an E-flat alto saxophone, because they\u2019re cheap and readily available. You can experiment with others, you can even start with others, but thats what most of the \u201cbeginner\u201d music is for, because it\u2019s far and away the least expensive. Ultimately, for me, the sweet spot wound up being the low-A baritone saxophone  Larger, heavier, but with a much richer and deeper tone. It all depends on the kind of music you want to make as well. Saxophone is well suited for jazz and orchestral music. If you\u2019ve got other aspirations, you might want to consider another instrument. If you\u2019re working with a group, trying to start a group, aspiring to join a group, you\u2019ll want to pick the flavor (alto, tenor, baritone and god help us all soprano) that\u2019s best suited to those needs. Migrating from one to another is trivial. Same fingering, largely the same mouth techniques. That, to me, makes playing saxophone really flexible. You can annoy all canines (and music lovers) in a 9-block radius with a soprano, or provide rich velvety undertones with a tenor with equal ease. Key tips: pad condition is paramount. Bad pads equal bad seals, equal perpetually out of tune or squeaky instrument. Springs are important too, but that\u2019s usually only a concern on much older instruments (the \u201949 alto sitting in my garage right now needs them in a serious sort of way). And don\u2019t shave pennies on reeds. That\u2019s where it all starts, and you\u2019re going to want good stuff there. They come in varying thickness and stiffness, and you\u2019ll have to try a variety to figure out what works for you. You\u2019ll also need a really, really good teacher. Making noise: trivial; making passable music, not too bad. But to really learn to work the saxophone, you\u2019re gonna need help from a pro. Best of luck. ",

            "answer_text": "The saxophone is often considered one of the easiest to learn. This is because unlike other woodwind instruments some whose history can be traced back to pre-historic times and then evolved by trial and error to became the instruments we have today, the saxophone was invented and can trace it\u2019s history to a specific date. Specifically 1846 when Adolphe Sax was issued the patent. This allowed the key work to be very practical and not to overly complex. Also as the saxophone over blows an octave the fingerings for the higher register are pretty much identical to the lower. Thus learning to play the sax is not a difficult thing to do compared to other woodwind instruments\u2026 That being said, the saxophone is the most difficult woodwind to master. As previous post have stated you are not going to become a saxophone genius over night. Beyond just learning the basics the saxophone is capable of such a wide range of sounds and tone colors, learning to control the instrument in order to achieve them is going to take years of practice, studying with saxophone instructors and most important, listening to other saxophonist. To sum it up\u2026. The saxophone is the easiest to learn, but the most difficult to master. ",
