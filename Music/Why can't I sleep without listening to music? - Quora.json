Well, this id actually a good question, for what i could come out as an answer is that when you don't have sleep at all, this helps.. I guess when I started doing this just because I couldn't sleep I stick (idk the past participle of stick buuut u know what i mean) with it. And now I can't sleep without music. But it's nothing bad tho, the only bad thing is if you sleep with any kind of head/earphones in your ears. It hurt \u2022_\u2022 ",

            "answer_text": "Don't take it as a problem some people might have this habit of listening to songs while sleeping, may be this is bcoz as it is said \u201cmusic soothes the mind and gives it rest \u201c Many people use music therapy as medical intervention to treat mood disorders, and as motivational technique May be you are a night thinker and soo you think abt your problems in night as our conscious brain is active during night and we cant control our thoughts but while listening to music it is said that music has the power to calm motivate and rejuvenate one's mind and soul. And that is why you fall asleep quickly But yess one more thing I want to say is When you feel sleepy remove your earphone , if you are using , otherwise it may damage your eardrums ",
