Couldn't relate to it. Country music these days seemingly would qualify as southern rock lite. But why listen to it when I can just grab some real southern rock?As a geezer, I've learned to appreciate and like most everything, including reggae and disco. Even have a few rap albums. No country.Suum cuique. ",

I\u2019m not extremely against country (in fact, i tolerate it more than most), but it doesn\u2019t electrocute me with adrenaline like metal does. The first time I heard Poison, I actually thought Pandora accidentally mixed country music into my playlist. Shania Twain never made me want to get up and actually dance and headbang, but M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce never fails to make me feel like I\u2019m living my best life. So, metal\u2019s better. It\u2019s always better. ",

There is good music and bad music. The genre alone doesn't mean much. Different genres transmit different moods. Heavy metal is great as soundtrack of action movies. Country is ok when enjoying a road trip on a sunny day. Both situations are hardly ever interchangeable. ",

Heavy metal is for that every second when you feel numb and lost but you find your footing in the quicksand. ",
