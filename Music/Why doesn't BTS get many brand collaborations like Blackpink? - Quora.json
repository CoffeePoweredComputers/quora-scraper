            "answer_text": "Well\u2026That is because BTS has brains and while most groups gets SPONSORSHIPS\u2026..BTS does COLLABORATIONS\u2026.They get to choose and pick and decide if a brand is worth endoresment, not the other way around. It\u2019s called excusivity and scarcity principle. The lesser you have of something, the more worth it has. Which means if BTS endores something - It is considered valuable and within industry whatever you are selling is \u201cBTS approved\u201d ( not other way around) and that means the credibity increases in the market. So BP can go ahead and get 100 sponsors - it will never stand the same gravity that one endorement from BTS will hold. !! Think for yourself - Which one you think sounds more authentic - a celebrity that do commercial ads for every brand that is offered or celebrity who pick and carefully select a few brand to work with? It\u2019s all about exclusivity. Unlike YG and BP that just goes after whatever money is offered, BTS and BH work together to decide what kind of products and events they want to associate themselves. Sometimes they even collaborate with small local businesses because they align with the same philosophy that BTS has in terms of product quality or environment sustainability or social contributions. If a product do not align with their personal preference - that brand has no chance. Yet, another thing - BTS, unlike BP, doesn\u2019t discriminate. BP can get a lot of commercial for individual artist and it is famous that Jennie and Lisa gets most high value endorsements in BP (Not my word but Blinks themselves say this!!) That is not how BTS works. BTS do not work with any brand that discriminates - It is a part of their contract since day 01. They all feature equally or nothing. So yeah, ARMYs know it\u2019s seven or none. Even luxury brands have classes of distinction and believe me, right now - Even luxary brands can only hope for BTS to wear something that carry their label. ",
