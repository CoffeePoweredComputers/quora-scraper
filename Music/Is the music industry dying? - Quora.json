            "answer_text": "Music has been devalued today. Long time ago pre-internet people had more free time and limited choices for entertainment. It was either music or TV/movies or go out. Now you can be over stimulated and entertained till your heart contends. No one is dying to buy an album or single anymore. That sort of rock star fanaticism is gone. Modern technology has given every single person an ego-centric focus. This is what social media is about: I post something, I get a lot of likes and comments. This brings importance to me and I feel good. Ok, let's do it again. Quite addicting isn't it? The focus is me, me, me. In this type of ME culture, people are more reluctant to put other people on pedestals. The consequence is the decline of the rock star and the rise of the reality TV star, which implies it is basically only about the image. The music takes a back seat. So when the people won't buy music, the record industry has to respond by pumping stars with an image. Then the quality goes down because the art has been taken out of music and the only thing that remains is commerce. In essence, songs nowadays are not a true expression, it is assembled by multiple writers. With carefully written lyrics and hooks the subject matter is designed to appeal to the ME culture. That is, \"Your'e worth it baby\", \"It's all about you\". A pop hit is usually manufactured! Real talent is not rising to the top anymore, the industry will not develop them or allow it. Just look at American Idol, hundreds and thousands of people can sing and they all want to be rock/pop stars. Why develop an artist when you have a 100 people that can sing like a famous star with perhaps a slight variation? The old industry existed because the budget was big! They signed you, invested millions in you to promote you (just like movie promotion) and did everything for you. That doesn't happen anymore. The industry isn't making money. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, music is in a pretty healthy state. Technology has democratised both the making and distribution of music and facilitated a wave of great creativity. Do you need to buy vast swathes of expensive equipment? Not anymore! You can make great music with simple, cheap, readily available equipment in the comfort of your own home. Can\u2019t afford studio time? No problem - its never been easier to set up a bedroom studio. Want to collaborate with a Brazilian guitarist and a Sardinian mouth music artist? No problem at all - just send each other files over the Internet. Want to get your music heard? There are literally dozens of platforms you can use to do that. Need specialist technical help? Again, you can find that mastering specialist online. Need to learn how to play a new instrument? Just find those lessons on You Tube. Music creation and the ability to find music you want to listen to is quite literally more democratised now than at any other moment in human history The music industry however is in a bad way because, really, the main thing record companies had going for them was a monopoly on distribution. Now that monopoly has been broken, they have to work very hard to make a dollar. Remember when the music industry wanted to put a tax on blank tapes because of the assumption that every tape was a lost record sale? Of course it wasn\u2019t - actually it encouraged people to listen to music that they otherwise wouldn\u2019t buy . In the same way the availability of free digital music doesn\u2019t itself kill the music industry (in the same way that free electricity didn\u2019t kill the candle making industry) but it does mean that people can bypass it and get directly to the music maker without a third party in the way contributing little The one problem with all this though is artist payment. Its true these are going down and many artists are not getting the money they deserve for their intellectual property. This does need to be worked on - although it seems (through rising ticket prices) that many have concluded that the money is to be made from live performances and that recorded music acts as a promotional tool to get people to live performances. New economic models need to be developed, but its true that many artists are currently underpaid Music itself though? In a very healthy state ",
