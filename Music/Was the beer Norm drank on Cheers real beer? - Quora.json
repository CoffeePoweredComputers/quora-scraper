            "answer_text": "It was indeed actual beer! However, it was nothing like the kind you'd ever want to drink. It was a beverage called \u201cnear beer\u201d and as its name implies, it was nearly beer, from an alcohol standpoint. It was brewed, made from yeast and hops as regular beer is, but it was as watered down as a $8 cup of beer you'd inexplicably buy at Fenway Park. It reportedly was \u201clike drinking beer flavored Gatorade, but with the carbonation of a bottle of seltzer water\u201d according to George Wendt aka \u201cNorm Peterson\u201d The idea was to has a visual depiction of beer that looked like the real thing, without cast members getting sloshed on it.

            "answer_text": "Drinking real alcoholic beverages is not usually done because during filming it is not unusual for there to be multiple takes of the same scene and if the actors were drinking a real alcoholic drink, they would not be able to \u201cwrap\u201d the filming session. What is usually consumed is carbonated iced tea or near-beer e.g. O\u2019Douls or other brands. ",
