Before becoming a K-pop idol everyone have to go through extreme years of training that includes singing lessons , Dancing lessons , exercise , Diet sessions , language learning and a lot of other stuff . So their are many artist who were not gifted with these talents before but with hard work , dedication that they have to do in their training period before becoming a K-pop idol they were able to develop these skills. These extreme training periods are one of the reason why a lot of k-celebrities are all rounder , like everyone can dance good and even many actors can sing. It's easy to ask \u201cIf I can become a K-pop idol if I don't have this or that\u201d but becoming a K-pop idol is not as easy as it seems those beautiful idols are not perfect they have flaws a lot of flaws and they have to go through a looooooooot of stuff and hardships for becoming a K-pop idol. If you are ready to sacrifice your sleep , sacrifice your fav food , sacrifice your comfort zone , and is ready to not give up no matter how many obstacles come to your way , then only you should think about becoming a K-pop idol and go for it. So first ask yourself Are you ready ? I am not trying to demotivate you just trying to show you the real world that is hard to be seen behind the limelight and beauty of K-pop . Hope this helped you.

            "answer_text": "Of course. Literally so many top groups can\u2019t sing at all and look at where they are. Kpop is not a genre that emphasizes on proper vocal or singing, it\u2019s mostly show and trying to get that dance over with the easiest vocals possible. Exceptions are groups like EXO, BTOB, TVXQ, Mamamoo. Fans tend to focus on \u2018personalities\u2019 and looks more than anything else. Almost all groups have some sort of choreography and the music is mostly generic, what some fans will admit and some others will pretend their biases are musically exceptional cause they wrote their own lyrics or produced a part. A lot of groups have members that are given singing parts but have no vocal training at all. I went to a group\u2019s concert last year and the concert was mostly yelling (\u2018rapping\u2019) and the singing was not even mediocre, to say the least. It was so disappointing but at least the dancing was ok. And this was what is considered a top group. ",

As long as they can rap well, or they\u2019re good at dancing, or both. Different companies will set different sets of standards though. There is a chance with certain companies that you can debut for only having good looks. Take a look at my wonderful ultimate bias, Kim Seokjin of BTS. He debuted because of his looks only, he had no skill in rapping, singing, or dancing at that time. But what he did was that over the years he improved himself, and now look at him! Hittin\u2019 them high notes in Epiphany, and composing his own tracks like Tonight! <3 ",

When you become a trainee you\u2019re given singing, dancing and language lessons so your singing will most likely improve. This is all coming from the fact that NCT\u2019s Lucas was solely Scouted because of his visuals\u2026 so you have a chance if you think you have the visual or may not dance skills or something ",

This was also another possible reason why he doesn\u2019t get as many lines in songs. Jin has actually said he was recruited because of his visuals. So, you can become a K-Pop idol if you can\u2019t sing. If you become a trainee, you\u2019ll most likely take vocal lessons in order to better your vocals. Hope this helped!

You need to be good at dancing, should have your own style and swagger and to some point good looks to impress the fans . If you possess these then maybe...maybe you can try on your luck in this field but if you are not a very good singer it would be a great struggle for you. All the other things won't cover up your bad singing. I would suggest you not to go after k-pop. ",

If your vocal is not good, I will suggest something that will surely make your vocal better - Drink a bulky amount of water. Never make your throat thirsty.Start chewing mulethi (a stick per day of mulethi). It will minimise your harshness.Avoid oily food , junk food , sour and sweet .Secondly also avoid bad habits of drinking, smokinh it cause trembling in your vocal.Start gargling with boiled salted water and serve a spoon of honey at morning that will improves melodiousnessAt last the most important practice like vocal warm ups, singing alone your favourite song , Riyaaz at morningI'm surely said all this things make your vocal good and you can be a good singer, if you starting regulate this things in you life. It rewards you in very big amount for long term of life. Thanx for reading and apologize for weak pronunciation ",
