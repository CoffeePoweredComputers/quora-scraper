The Londonderry Air is a traditional Irish melody, and as such, is in the public domain. The words of the song \u201cOh Danny Boy\u201d were written in the early years of the 20th century by Frederic Weatherly - who many will be surprised to learn was an Englishman. \u201cYou Raise Me Up\u201d is an entirely different song altogether, written in the early 21st century by Norwegian Rolf L\u00f8vland, and Irishman Brendan Graham who performed together under the name Secret Garden. It has one phrase - (the first four notes of the chorus) which are the same as one four note phrase in the Londonderry Air - but there is nothing sinister or unusual about that - the first four notes of Baa Baa Blacksheep are the same as the first four notes of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star and no one accuses the composer of one of plagiarising the other. In the case of both songs, the melodies are otherwise quite distinct. ",
