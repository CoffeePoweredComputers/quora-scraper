            "answer_text": "Remember that song structure is not the same as poetry. There are verses, choruses and the bridge in the traditional pop song. The verses tell the story, the chorus (usually the same each time or with some variations and the same structure) which traditionally contains \u201cthe hook\u201d, which is the main, usually title, of the song. The music of the choruses are usually the same as each other and the verses are usually the same as each other, but the bridge is usually a different section which is often only repeated once and it sort of drives home the \u201cstory\u201d in the song. Now, this is a very basic, formulaic song and there are MANY exceptions. Buying and using a rhyming dictionary is a help when you are using a rhyming scheme and just cannot come up with that right word. Next, really study how the songwriters you most want to emulate structure their songs, especially compared to the \u201cformula\u201d I described. Perhaps that is not how you wish to write (because this is just one type of song structure of many). Listen to songs that you don\u2019t know well and analyze their structure. In most cases, you do NOT want a long instrumental introduction, if you are writing a pop song. Unless you are Freddie Mercury, or of that caliber, avoid a song being over 3:45\u20134:00 long (look at the time of the songs you most enjoy). Most pop songs are even a few seconds shorter than the time I suggested. Once you start writing and studying this formulaic songs, you can move onto creating your own writing style because you have a good basis from which to start. Diane Warren has written many, many hits for top artists, so look up her discography and listen with a learning approach to how the structure of her songs is similar to each other and start from there. You should keep a journal with you all of the time and when you get song idea, write it down immediately. If you are sleeping, or almost asleep and come up with an idea, write it down NOW, not after you\u2019ve slept because you could well forget it. This is how our production company worked with promising songwriters. We also put them with established writers to help improve their writing. As for the music part, we would hear what people wrote and then helped them edit the song, as opposed to giving them as much direction as the lyrics. So, with writing both music and lyrics, try to work with someone (network to find someone with whom you \u201cclick\u201d) and that should help. There are many seminars, contests, etc. about songwriting too. This is just a really basic place to start. Once you get started, you will find your way to your own style. Best of luck. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no right or wrong way to start writing so here are a few suggestions for you to try. Journal at the end of each day. Start writing how you feel about your day, what went well, what was disappointing, what did you learn. Just write in your own words and don\u2019t think about it too much. When you\u2019ve done this for a week or two look back at the previous weeks journal entries and see if there\u2019s any themes or phrases that jump out at you. These could be used for song titles, themes or lyrics. It\u2019s a great way of finding your own writing style.Analyse songs you like. It takes a bit of music theory but it can really help to get your creative juices flowing. It helps you learn the rules of songwriting so you can learn to break them later. If you don't know enough music theory to do this have a look on YouTube, There\u2019s lot\u2019s of great videos analysing songs on their. Have a look at this analysis of Skyfall by Adele for example. goo.gl/7UxGwRRecord any melodies you come up with throughout your day. It doesn\u2019t have to be fancy, the voice recorder in your smart phone will work. Keep doing this regularly and you\u2019ll have plenty of melodies as a starting point for writing your next song. These are only starting points, you\u2019ll have to add other melodies too them, add the chords and the lyrics but it\u2019s a great starting point.Immerse yourself in learning songwriting and writing in general. Read poetry, read books, watch lessons on YouTube etc. Songwriting is a skill that takes time to learn, don\u2019t let the size of the skill stop you from starting. Just writing a line a day is great progress. It might take you months to finish your first song but you\u2019ll get much better over time. The more you write the better you\u2019ll get.Hope those suggestions help. Good luck ",
