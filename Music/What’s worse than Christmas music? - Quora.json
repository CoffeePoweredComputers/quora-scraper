            "answer_text": "The uptick in automobile accidents, domestic violence and yes, even murder-suicides, that the police and first responders who work the holiday season experience. Not all family gatherings at Christmas are greeting card perfect happy scenarios, I am sad to say. And not everyone experiences joy and merriment at this time of year. For some, the Christmas season is a sobering anniversary of some trauma or heart-wrenching loss. I recall the commentary of an aged German veteran of Stalingrad, a man named Hans Rostewitz in a documentary film about the epic battle. The documentary, one of the best I have ever seen, if not THE best, a three-parter with on-camera accounts from veteran soldiers and civilians from both sides, told in the original languages of the participants with English subtitles, dates from the early 2000s. It is a German film production, Sebastien Dehnhardt, and Jorg Mullner being the principal filmmakers, but with the help of countless others and remarkably, the participation of the Russians. The illustrious Guido Knopp is also involved. Herr Knopp is a German journalist and book author who is known in Germany for his highly acclaimed TV documentaries about the Third Reich, National Socialism, and Stalinism. I highly recommend it for viewing. But anyway, back to Hans Rostewitz. For him, every Christmas he goes back in time to December 24th, 1942 with himself and his battle-weary, starved, frozen comrades dug into their trenches and improvised shelters from the elements. The 6th Army had been surrounded and cut off from the rest of the world only a month before. Hitler ordered that it hold its ground, at all costs. As pointless as this order was, for Hitler, it was all about his prestige. The city that bore Stalin\u2019s name, his ideological enemy, must be held to the last man, the last spent bullet, the last trickle of blood, as he would\u2019ve put it. Rostewitz tells us on camera how clear the night time sky was, that Christmas Eve, and the moon and stars that bore silent witness to their misery. There was a lull in the battle, no fighting or shooting or shelling going on, it was peaceful. In this brief but very much welcomed respite from the war, the men reached into their pockets and brought out what family photos they\u2019d had with them, many with tears welling up in their eyes as their thoughts traveled the distances between the homes and family lives they\u2019d left behind and their current situation. There was talk of happier times, of tables laden with food and drink, of Tannenbaum\u2019s and children\u2019s smiles, of laughter and the loving embraces of wives and sweethearts. What little food, candied sweets or tobacco there was, was passed around, the largesse of whatever supplies dropped by Goering\u2019s Luftwaffe on the troops they managed to get ahold of, some in boxes labeled, A Gift From The Fuhrer. The bitter irony of those words was not lost to many of the men nor to this aged veteran. Then someone in their group started to sing Silent Night, the German version of course, and spontaneously, his gesture caught on as more and more voices joined in until all of them were singing it, and singing it with such heartfelt emotion, such soul and wistful longing, that this aged veteran, Hans Rostewitz, burst into tears on camera as he relived the experience just in the telling. To this day, he says, he can\u2019t celebrate Christmas. For him, it is a time of sorrow and heartache. I imagine that Hans Rostewitz is no longer with us. I don\u2019t know, he may be alive but if here were, he\u2019d be in his nineties or nearing his centenary. He was already old when he told his story on camera. Many veterans of WWII are passing away. I am grateful that their eyewitness accounts are being recorded for posterity before they are all gone. ",

I never really had a thing for how the singers sang or the instrumentals that country music uses. You're most likely going to get a lot of different answers for this so don't take any of these answers as fact. ",
