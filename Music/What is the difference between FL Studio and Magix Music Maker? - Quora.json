            "answer_text": "FL Studio is more professional music creation program. It is more advanced, has more mixing tools, more on board synthesizers, more of everything. FL Studio is in the same area as Logic Pro or Cubase Pro while Magix is more like Apple Garage Band or Cubase Elements. A stripped down version of their big brothers. Good way to start your music adventures but expect to abandon it soon when you realize how limited it is. Btw, late Avicii was the FL Studio user. ",
