            "answer_text": "Personally I like to play Jason's bass lines the most. Check out his bass solo from the Cunning Stunts video:  While Anesthesia by Cliff is impressive, Jason's work somehow moves me much more and uses a bass guitar in completely different way. Although, the bass part in Orion creates similar emotion. Blackened and Harvester of Sorrow have some nice fast bass riffs. My Friend of Misery intro is a classic and very simple. I really dig how the bass works in Nothing Else Matters (especially if you listen to the S&M rendition). The God That Failed is another one with a great bass hook. Load has loads of great bass lines and I loved learning almost every single song from it. Obviously, King Nothing comes to mind first (and when you hear it live it really totally goes through you!) and when you play it it has some nice finger work :P  I haven't got around to learning Reload and all the next albums.

            "answer_text": "Hi! Metallica has some great songs for bass, since they have had 3 of the best Bass players in the Metal World (Cliff, Jason and Robert). I would choose any song from Cliff Burton's era, because songs from the era focused a lot on the bass guitar and of course, because Cliff had his signature written all over the place! The first one that comes to my mind is \"For whom the bells toll\" , you just need to listen to the first seconds of the song to realize it features the bass on the intro. Another one is \"Anethesia\", which is basically a bass solo. Then, if you want the real deal, try playing \"Orion\", one of my favorite songs, and listen to the bass on that song. If you want something fast and heavy, look no further, \"Master of Puppets\" will give you a good kick! Good luck and long live Metal! ",
