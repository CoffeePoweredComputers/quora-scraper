            "answer_text": "I won\u2019t say it's versatile. That goes to an HSH superstrat type guitar. I also hated the Telecaster once, for many years. Back then for me little was this sorry excuse of a guitar only a real cowboy would play, and its lipstick pickup was even lamer and duller than a Dano\u2019s. For me it was so thin and grating. If the Strat is glassy, the Tele is shards of glass stuck in your eyes. But then I saw a Japanese band called Toe doing their math rock/post rock stuff, and I was like hey that's not too bad for a Tele sound. I particularly liked the airy openness on the bass strings. I started to wonder if you can use a Tele for jazz. So I did a quick search on YouTube and found this:  And I was like holy crap! There's the tone!! It's not only a decent jazz tone, it has the heft and darkness I expect from a humbucker neck, but with the openness of a single coil! Not only that, I think it sounds better than a Strat! I started looking further. How about Telecaster for metal? I already know a Tele used for heavy rock, but not metal. Would it stand to a guitar with humbuckers? I found out not really, but what got me was that it does have a good lead guitar tone for metal! (Start at 4:55)  The secret, it turns out, is the tone knob. All one has to do to get back some of that meat is to turn the tone knob down. Not all the way of course, but enough to tame the highs and add enough mids. Another part of the secret is to keep the neck pickup involved. Just the bridge is indeed thin (and it has its uses), but in the middle and forward pickup selector positions (neck, neck + bridge) you add body thanks to the neck pickup. I got so sold that I took some money and got a cheap Stagg Tele type guitar with a P-90 (still single coil!) at the neck (which sounds stellar by the way). I keep the tone knob at around 3 to 5 (out of 10) and always have the neck pickup engaged. It's great for cleans and jazz and even some heavy lead stuff that needs more air. As for the hype, I think it is overhyped. It is useful but it doesn't cover all the important things. I think it got hyped because of its revival thanks to indie and post rock and people who generally actually know how to work a Tele! ",

            "answer_text": "I have several thoughts on this. The Telecaster is certainly not the most versatile guitar in its standard configuration. However, switching out the neck pickup for a humbucker or adding a middle pickup creates a really useful guitar. So the Tele is adaptable, rather than versatile.That said, there is no sound in electric guitar more distinctive than the Tele. If you find it tinny, that\u2019s fine, but listen to Steve Cropper play on any Booker T song - the sound cuts through the thickness of the organ beautifully.Everyone has a guitar that fits him/her. For years I played almost exclusively on Gibsons, because that was the neck that felt good to me. For the past few years, I have moved largely to Fenders, which now feel better to me. It\u2019s not really fun to play a guitar that doesn\u2019t feel good in hand.I do think that Teles (and Jazzmasters) are disproportionately hot at this time. For reasons not clear to me, Stratocasters and Les Pauls are not quite as popular as Teles, and Gibson SGs are really less prominent. However, these trends shift back and forth, and Telecasters may lose a bit of popularity in coming years.",
