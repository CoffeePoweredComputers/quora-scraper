            "answer_text": "Mentally speaking, Billie Eilish is in decent shape in 2019... but for at least two years (2017-18), she was a mess. I've seen some people claiming it was \"fake depression\" which is LAUGHABLE. It\u2019s true that she was a typical angst-ridden teen going through all the normal depressing crap of being that age... BUT... she had to do it under a giant microscope with half the globe watching. Put yourself in her shoes for a bit. High school peer pressure was bad enough for most people... anyone here reach age 15 and have millions of people criticizing your every move on social media? Now add the pressure of a career where your entire family and dozens of other people (and their families) are counting on your success. And they\u2019re there at work with you and basically part of every minute of your life. If I'm being honest, I'd crumble under that kind of pressure. Hell, I'd have probably grabbed the first million and run away to an island somewhere. Finally add the fact that your childhood is basically gone. You can\u2019t just go hang out with all your old friends. Most of them have become weird and fan-like around you. And you really can\u2019t go ANYWHERE without causing minor stampedes. You travel to all kinds of great cities while touring, but can\u2019t go sightseeing or shopping because fans will literally MOB you. You\u2019ll get hurt\u2026 they\u2019ll get hurt\u2026 it will be bad. Billie has learned to manage the depression and stress and she's seemingly emerged on the other side in good form. There have been several interviews, starting in the summer of 2019, where she has discussed being in a really good place. She mentioned deleting a lot of the social media stuff from her phone, and cites that as a big part of the improvement in her outlook. She\u2019s also built a small community of friends into a sort of tour entourage, which allows her to have fun while otherwise being a virtual prisoner for weeks at a time. ",

            "answer_text": "    This. A grown ass man commenting on a young girl\u2019s body in the most vile and repulsive way possible. In the first three pictures, Billie Eilish is 17 years old, and in this last one in which she has gray hair, she\u2019s 14.Billie has talked about how she\u2019s uncomfortable with people seeing her body and commenting on it, and she also said this is the reason why she wears baggy clothes.This is what she said in a Calvin Klein ad:Billie Eilish is speaking her truth in a new Calvin Klein ad by revealing the reason behind her signature baggy clothes. In the brand\u2019s all-new campaign, dubbed \u201cI Speak My Truth In #MyCalvins,\u201d Billie explains that she doesn't want the world to know everything about her, so she relies on fashion to protect herself.\u201cThat\u2019s why I wear baggy clothes,\u201d she saysin the ad, which also features Noah Centineo, Shawn Mendes, and Chika Oranika. \u201cNobody can have an opinion because they haven't seen what\u2019s underneath. Nobody can be like, \u2018she\u2019s slim-thick,\u2019 \u2018she\u2019s not slim-thick,\u2019 \u2018she\u2019s got a flat ass,\u2019 \u2018she's got a fat ass.\u2019 No one can say any of that because they don't knowThere are so many reasons why what this dude\u2019s doing is so foul to me.Billie is still a CHILD. Yes, you could try to argue that she\u2019s legal in some states, countries, etc. But tell me, does that make any of this less creepy? Having to justify yourself with an argument as predatory as \u201cShe\u2019s 17!1!1 She\u2019s now legal!1!1\u201d isn\u2019t really helping your cause here. Regardless of the age of consent, Billie is still very young, and I just want to point out that this man is probably even older than her Ass I said before, Billie has expressed discomfort with being sexualised and body shamed. This is exactly why she covers herself so much. It\u2019s an asshole move to say these things about a person who has expressed discomfort about being seen in a sexual manner. There\u2019s this little thing called boundaries, and I think this sad excuse of a human being should learn a thing or two about them.This just reflects how women\u2019s bodies (also men\u2019s bodies, but i\u2019m focusing more on women\u2019s bodies since i\u2019m talking about Billie) are so heavily sexualised in modern society. It\u2019s terrible how a young girl can\u2019t wear something that shows a little bit of skin without a mass of people coming at her for it, either body shaming or sexualising the living shit out of her.And regardless of what anybody says, this dude can\u2019t stop saying disgusting shit. He\u2019s even posting pictures of her when she was 14 and captioning it with shit like \u201cshe\u2019s thick \u201dIn conclusion, I don\u2019t really want to live in a world like this anymore. ",
