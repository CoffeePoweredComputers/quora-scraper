            "answer_text": "Following are the few songs with completely rap given by Mike Shinoda. I would be giving you with the names of the album chronologically:- 1.Hybrid Theory(2001):- a)High Voltage:Very old one as this song was also as one of the tracks. b)Papercut:Rap is the basis of the song. But you will get vocals from Chester. 2.Meteora(2003):- a)Nobody\u2019s Listening:Total rap song. At the start of the song japanese flute shakuhachi is played. 3)Minutes to Midnight(2007):-This album is very different from its predecessors.You will get to hear guitar solos and music is quite evolved not like they use nu metal but alternative rock. a)Hands Held High: Its a song about war.Personally I think it was written about US-Iraq war. b)Bleed it Out:Song about trying to make a perfect song but everytime it gets wrong. 4.A Thousand Suns:This album doesn\u2019t much contain Mike\u2019s solo rap performance. 5.Living Things: a)Until It Breaks b)Lost In the Echo:Best songs of LP.Though Chester sings few parts of the song. 6.The Hunting Party: a)All For Nothing  Mike Shinoda ",

But that's annoying and difficult, so here:  LP Underground is Linkin Park\u2019s yearly (I think?) album of unreleased tracks and demos, as well as being the name for their official fan club. I Have Not Begun, from LPU 10, is a song that\u2019s entirely Mike being awesome.  Step Up is a song from the Hybrid Theory EP which isn't TECHNICALLY all rap, since it has some other weird spoken lyrics in there. And if you're looking for more rap from Mike Shinoda, you could check out Fort Minor, his side project.  ",

Watch out for their new single- Heavy. But I suppose you might like the Eminem version of Somewhere I belong. Guilty All The Same has great rap too. Bleed it Out is mostly rap apart from the ending. Figure 09 is also pretty good too, and so is Lying From You. All things said, there are no songs that are completely rap. You might also like QWERTY. I think you\u2019d probably like listening to Fort Minor songs if you like Mike Shinoda\u2019s rap. ",
