            "answer_text": "If you are singing vibrato and it hurts your throat, you're not doing it properly. I am aware of two kinds of vibrato. One kind results from pulsing the air pressure. You can practice this starting slowly and gradually increasing the speed. Good singers have amazing control of this and can progress from very slow to very fast. It's called vibrato, but it's really pulsed loudness.  Another kind of vibrato seems to be caused by fluctuations in the muscles in the throat. I have very little control over this kind except I can turn it on or off. I like the sound of it because it's faster than I can produce by pulsing the air. It does not cause  soreness, but  that may be because I don't use it very often. I suggest you develop your ability to use the pulsed-air vibrato. You can do four pulsations on each note of the scale, gradually increasing the tempo. You can practice it with different vowel sounds. It won't be long before you can do this  easily and with control, progressing smoothly from slow to moderately fast vibrato. I have never gained the ability to do a very fast vibrato this way, but I have heard people do it very effectively, and I guess they have practiced it more than I have. :) Uncontrolled \"natural\" vibrato is just uncontrolled singing. Get control of it as described above.   ",

            "answer_text": "Natural vibrato is generally faster than a forced pitch bend vibrato.  It's possible that you are singing with tension that is making you tired.  If you have tension, it's unlikely that your vibrato is natural.  It could just be that you are creating tension from singing in general and thus you are tired from singing, it's not likely the vibrato itself, fake or not, that is making you more tired, unless you are tensing up even more to create it. If you haven't learned to sing with an open throat and develop your natural vibrato, you're probably creating one.  Find a good teacher and learn how to relax when singing, and remove the tension that makes you feel tired - jaw, tongue, throat, neck, head, all these things can cause discomfort and fatigue with singing.
