            "answer_text": "Hello :) . I\u2019m a harmonica blues player, And although people here have mentioned pretty good players they are missing the most important ones! which are the fathers of the harmonica blues as we know it today. User-11148241891870748452 was pretty close by mentioning Muddy Waters Band but he named the second best harmonica player in the band! You see, before Cotton joined Waters Band the harmonica man in the band was LITTLE WALTER. And remember this name. Little Walter is the inventor of the harmonica sound as we know it today. He was the first man to ever plug an amplifier to an harmonica. The man was so tired of playing harmonica in the back and of being \u201ceaten\u201d by the sound of the guitars amplifiers that he decided to put a microphone in his hand and send the harmonica to the amp. And also\u2026. he was most probably one of the best harmonica players that ever existed: Check him out:  He was also a prominent guitar player and singer:  Some others amazing harmonica players: Sonny Boy Williamson (BOTH I and II) :   Sony Terry:  And My all time favourite, not only because of his technique with the harmonica, (I am convinced that he was the first person to ever record a blowing technique on the harmonica called \u201coverblowing\u201d although he probably didn\u2019t even know) but also because he was (To me anyways) the most talented blues musician who ever existed. I think Jason Ritchie was mentioned somewhere in the comments and he also loves him. His name was ALAN WILSON and he was the creator of many anthems you sure know as \u201cGoing up the country\u201d with his group Canned Heat or \u201cOn the road again\u201d. But I will leave you some songs not much people know of and that show his amazing playing skills:  Wait for his solo in this one:  Here you can meet him, playing in third position, which is not an easy thing to do:  There are many others, but they are too many to mention here! :) Hope I helped you out! Daniel. ",

            "answer_text": "The Tampa Bay Area has been wonderful for blues music since the 80\u2019s, although sadly the last decade has seen a decline in venues for live music. However, these are some of our wonderful blues musicians - First, forever, is Rock Bottom, also sometimes known as Woodlawn Fats. (deceased 2001). David \"Rock Bottom\" C. York  After Rock, in no particular order \u2014 T.C. Carr - TC Carr | & Bolts of Blue  Rick Hatfield Rick Hatfield (there\u2019s a cool video on his site - The Cherry Red Austin Healy)  Sonny Charles (aka Chuck Ross) and the Home | Backtrack Blues Band  Kim Harpo - in this video with Liz Pennock and Dr. Blues -  Nitro Bozeman - in this video with Sarasota Slim  I know there are others - I haven\u2019t been active in the blues scene for a few years. I would have liked to include Stevie DeSalvo - who died several years ago - in this group, but I couldn\u2019t locate any of his recordings. For more info on what\u2019s happening currently, check out Suncoast Blues Society. I also found this article, which looks to be kind of definitive on blues harmonica - Top-10 blues harmonica players ",
