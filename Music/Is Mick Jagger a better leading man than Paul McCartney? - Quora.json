            "answer_text": "Yes and No. The Rolling Stones got their first Chart Entry from recording a Beatles song written by Lennon-McCartney and recorded by the Beatles with Ringo Starr on lead vocals, bless his heart, this song flopped but the Stones who were lovers of Blues more so then Rock n Roll heeded the advice of Paul and John of the Beatles who told them to start writing their own songs and reap the rewards of royalties. McCartney was a better songwriter then Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, he also gets the thumbs up from me for acknowledging Beatles audience members by having a habit of turning round to the audience who sat behind the band in stadiums and acknowledging them. When you say leading man I turn my mind to who was a better live stage performer, in this regard Mick Jagger was famous for crazy dance movements that led to current pop band Maroon 5 honouring him in their song, \u2018Move Like Jagger'. Mick is probably the better dancer, bit does that make him the better leading man? Also if you refer to who was the better leading man as a solo artist that is Paul McCartney and Wings or Paul McCartney as a stand alone artist I am not aware of Mick Jagger recording as a solo artist by himself. Having said that, Paul McCartney's latest album, EGYPT STATION has already hit number one in September, 2018, this month! His first number one hit album in 36 years, so personally I think Sir Paul McCartney is the better leading man. How often did Mick Jagger play piano, guitar or bass on stage, compare this to Paul and Paul's the pick of the two for me. ",

            "answer_text": "This is one of those fun but ultimately unanswerable questions. We\u2019re talking two different approaches, two different roles. Jagger is generally considered the best frontman in rock music. He has basically created and set the mold for what a lead singer does. McCartney is different. Multi-instrumentalist, excellent voice, composer of some of the greatest songs in history. However, even though obviously Paul is the frontman of\u2026well\u2026Paul McCartney, he\u2019s more of a piece of the band puzzle, while Jagger is primarily a vocalist that the other Stones are in support of. Even Keith has stated that the band\u2019s job is to support the lead singer. It\u2019s pretty much the same as when we compare the Beatles to the Stones. The structure of the Beatles was tighter, four musicians as more of a single entity. The Stones were structured more as a lead singer with four guys behind him shoveling the coal. And damn, I feel lucky that I grew up when both those bands were at the creative peaks. They\u2019re my two favorites, the perfect ying and yang of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. ",
