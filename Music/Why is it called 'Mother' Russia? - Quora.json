            "answer_text": "Russia is the mother. The idea appeared in Ancient Rus. At the first stage, the word Mother was associated with a word combination of damp earth, which was a variant of the Great Mother Goddess. The Russian land appeared to be a living being in the mother's guise. Since the XVI century, under the influence of the works of Andrei Kurbsky and Maxim the Greek, the name Holy Russia appeared, and the mother-land acquired the form of the Svyatorusskaya. The idea developed in the works of V. Trediakovsky, F. Prokopovich, M. Lomonosov, and in the 18th century, although at that time the symbolic designation Fatherland was used more often for the country. Symbols The Tsar-Father and Mother Russia were finally formed by the beginning of the XIX century, for during the reign of Catherine II the word Mother firmly entrenched behind the ruler herself. The homeland is the universal word, Rus emphasizes the antiquity, the heroic past of the country, Russia is a later name, but the essence is one, folklore. Mother Russia Mother Russia is Russia's unofficial, secular national personification.  \"Motherland Calls\" - the name of the main sculpture of the memorial complex, built on Mamayev Hill in the hero-city of Volgograd. The hill, on which stands the figure of a woman with a sword, rises to 14 meters, and the statue itself has a height of 85 meters. It dominates the surrounding terrain and is visible from a distance of tens of kilometers. The sculpture of Motherland is one of the most visited objects of Volgograd. Every year hundreds of thousands of people come here to honor the memory of soldiers and civilians who died during the Great Patriotic War.  The poster \"Motherland Calls\" was painted by artist Irakli Toidze in June 1941. The meaning of the image on the poster was that the woman (motherland mother, the collective image of the mother) is calling her sons to help, to defend the native land. The poster was born in the first days that have passed since the attack of the Nazi troops of the Hitlerite Third Reich on the Soviet Union. In the 2000s, singer Jasmine sang a song - \"Russia-Mother\" (music by A. Zubkov for poems by I. Kaminskaya). In the song it is said about Russia's finding happiness after centuries of shed tears. The performer with the soul sends the desire to save in memory everything that was with the country, and give her her heart.  Mother Russia is a special symbol for the inhabitants of the country. Having an age-old history, he will sing the best representatives of culture. And everyone from school remembers the lines told by Ushinsky that we are all nurtured by the waters of Russia, which has taught us its language and protects, like a mother, from enemies. That's why from time immemorial Russia is called Mother. This is a policy, a symbol, and a poetic comparison. But the main thing is that people's boundless love for their country, language, culture, history ... This is our main value - in love and devotion to Mother Russia. ",

            "answer_text": "The pre-revolutionary Russian philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev said that Russia possessed a \u201cwomenfolk\u2019s soul\u201d. He had both historical and anthropological reasons to it. First, it\u2019s the ancient notion of farmed land and pasture as a fertile, passive substance that feeds us and suffers through everything we do to it. Russian peasants were not different. Some of their reverence before matj syr\u00e1 zemly\u00e1 (\u201cMother Humid Soil\u201d) rubbed off on Russian aristocrats who sometimes transferred this maternal image on the nation. However, before the XIX century, the Russian nation was generally personified by Czars, their boyars and their gentry servants\u2014an active, masculine force. These men were moving and shaking things across the empire that was thought to be a viscous, passive, retrograde matter. The House of Romanovs was a ship sailing across the rich, but dim and often dangerous ocean of Russianness. Peter the Great and many of his descendants called their Empire Ot\u00e9chestvo (\u201cFatherland\u201d) instead. Things started to change when the Russian middle class was born in the mid-XIX century. Under their influence, the Czarist aristocracy also attempted to reconnect with the peasant foundation of Russian civilization. The feminine figure of Russia got an upgrade, and more and more of patriotic loyalty was directed to \u201cMother Russia\u201d who not only gives birth, but also takes care of her children. Before WWI, Mother Russia firmly took her place as an overarching patriotic symbol. Communists who didn\u2019t appreciate nationalism, first rejected it. But Stalin decided to turn the USSR into a Communist empire and recycled the narrative for the purposes of Soviet \u201cmultinational\u201d patriotism. The poster \u201cMotherland is Calling\u201d became the most high-profiled demonstration of it. \u201cBe a Hero! USSR Post, 30 Kopeck.\u201d The post stamp below shows the transformation that the Russian \u201cMotherland\u201d underwent in the bloody mist of WWII. From a caring, selfless woman, it turned into a kind of distressed, impoverished Valkyrie that blessed her warrior children to death in the flames of the holy war against Nazis.  ",
