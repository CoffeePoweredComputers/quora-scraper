            "answer_text": "I agree with what Willy Bearden said. In addition to that I\u2019ll add the following (it\u2019s my opinion, and I\u2019m certainly no expert): The black blues players from the early 1900s went to a lot of extremes in their dress and style due to the racial prejudices of the era. If everyone at the white clubs you\u2019re playing in are making it plain that \u201cto them\u201d you\u2019re nothing more than a \u201cworthless, simple-minded, guitar-player\u201d, one way to prove otherwise is to look the part of a classy, sophisticate with impeccable taste. Dress for success, in other words. Playing somewhere that makes you walk through the back door because they won\u2019t let you through the front? Having to drink from a different water fountain? You do it with a smile while wearing a classy suit topped off with an awesome hat. And \u201clooking like a stupid share-cropper\u201d is one less bad thing they can say about you\u2026 That ability to smile while someone\u2019s putting you down or not even paying you for the night, is the epitome of being \u201ccool\u201d, in fact, that IS being cool. I don\u2019t have a clue if that\u2019s how the whole mystique of the blues being cool got started, but it sounds likely to me. And if white guys (who can\u2019t possibly fully understand) want some of that \u201ccool\u201d to rub off on them, I can certainly understand if they think the easiest place to start would be their wardrobe. But there\u2019s a lot more to the blues than playing notes on a guitar while wearing a great hat. ",

Blues and Jazz are wide worlds where people can be a member of the club by simply showing up, paying at the door, and showing out. Blues and Jazz have given so many people something to do, something to think about, something to learn, and somewhere to be. It\u2019s a cool thing. ",
