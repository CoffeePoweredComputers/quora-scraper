            "answer_text": "I have a few favorite foods and they change from time to time depending upon time of year and my mood. Right now these have top-of-mind: I don't make it very often because it is time-consuming, but my mother and her mother made it really well, and so do I, when I take the time. And if you have ever had good Pastitsio, you know what I mean.    I love a good crabcake (made from lump Chesapeake Bay blue crab, not the Dungeness monstrosities that are eaten on the West Coast). This photo was found on the web but it is identified as a crab cake from the restaurant in suburban Baltimore where we had my mom's 80th birthday party. Those are damn good crabcakes.  For a nice family dinner there is nothing like pot roast and mashed potatoes.  And for dessert, perhaps a chocolate eclair.   My husband and I have a favorite meal to eat out. We had this meal for dinner on our wedding day, just the two of us (we eloped to the courthouse at 9 am on a Friday, had breakfast afterwards with our witnesses, but didn't throw any kind of reception). We have it every year on our anniversary, and on Valentine's Day (because we never have to worry about getting a reservation, dressing up, etc). It's Peking duck.   Here's a photo from the last time we had it (our anniversary is in November).  We learned to love Peking duck when we lived in Washington, DC (where there are at least three world-class Peking duck restaurants, and we frequented all of them). In Portland we have settled on one place that we really like, and we always go there. We find that it is not very difficult for two motivated people to eat a whole Peking duck.  On one occasion when we did have some duck left over, I had a brainstorm and on the way home from dinner we stopped at the grocery store so I could get the rest of the ingredients I needed to transform leftover duck into Cassoulet.   There's a place in Paris called Thoumieux that makes the best Cassoulet I've ever had, but I found that I could make a damn fine one at home in the slow cooker. In Portland there are a couple of restaurants that do it well also. ",

            "answer_text": "Currently, my favorite food is actually a selection of cheeses that I was able to try at Rise No. 1 in Dallas, TX, but which quickly became a staple of my meals at home due to the pandemic. I remember thinking to myself when I first tried the cheese board (or chariot de fromages) at Rise many years ago, \u201cHow delicious could this possibly be?\u201d Turns out, incredibly. I suddenly understood what people meant when they said they were \u201ctransported\u201d by a food. It goes beyond sustenance. I highly recommend trying the cheeses I list below.  Boschetto al Tartufo Bianchetto. This cheese is made from sheep\u2019s milk and contains bits of truffle throughout. It is sweet and earthy, and the deliciousness of the cheese is magnified if you shave the cheese with a cheese curler. The cheese curler also makes it delicate and soft. I cannot emphasize enough just how delicious this cheese is. It is always the one I eat first when I create a cheese board or travel to Rise No. 1.Peppercorn wrapped Chevre. Though I have not been able to find the particular cheese on igourmet\u2019s website, or anywhere else online, I\u2019m aware that it exists because it is at Rise No.1 in Dallas. You can see it on the left side in the picture above. I suspect it is made by Montchevre, but I\u2019m unsure. It is made from goat milk and is incredibly soft (you could dip a spoon in it, instead of using a knife) and can be crumbly. What I love about the peppercorn wrapped chevre is that it packs a punch. Not only is it soft and creamy, but the peppercorn makes it deliciously spicy.Purple Haze. Cypress Grove\u2019s Purple Haze competes with the Boschetto al Tartufo Bianchetto for my favorite cheese of all time. It is truly addicting. Lavender buds are mixed with wild-harvested fennel pollen. What this means is that it tastes like lavender and fennel mixed; the flavors are not overpowering, but just enough to make you crave more. Like the chevre, it is made from goat milk, and it is soft enough to eat with a spoon, rather than a knife. It, too, can be crumbly.Perlagrigia with Truffles. This cheese I did not discover through Rise No. 1 in Dallas, but rather through igourmet online. (Because I enjoyed the Boschetto al Tartufo so much, I wanted to try several different truffle cheeses.) In contrast to the Boschetto, the Perlagrigia has a much milder flavor and reminds me of Christmas due to the cinnamon ash on its rind. I highly recommend it. It is made from cow\u2019s milk and requires a knife to cut.Tintern. This is the only POW! cheese that I am listing here. Its flavor packs a punch, such that I don\u2019t tend to eat a ton of it all at once and usually have enough left over through two cycles of buying cheeses. What I enjoy about it is that it has a ton of chives and shallots mixed throughout it, and it actually kind of almost tastes cheddary. It is made from cow\u2019s milk. A little bit goes a long way.Saint Andre. It is a super soft, triple cream cheese made from cow\u2019s milk. (Think something similar to brie, but without the nutty flavor.) It\u2019s almost like eating butter or straight cream. It helps balance out cheeses like the Tintern above or the Boschetto. I highly recommend it as part of the chariot de fromages.There are a few other cheeses that I would love to list, but I don\u2019t remember their names, and Rise No. 1 has been off limits due to the pandemic. I likely won\u2019t be visiting for a while; however, once I do find out what the cheeses are called, I will definitely edit my list above to add them. I also want to say that on every cheese board, I make sure a good chunk of soft quince paste is present, as I tend to eat a little with almost every bite of cheese and crackers. I also put caramelized pecans on the side. In terms of crackers I tend to either use water crackers by Carr\u2019s at home. At Rise No. 1, they seem to use little crunchy and flavorless crostinis, which I actually prefer. I hope I have inspired you to try some of the cheeses above!  ",
