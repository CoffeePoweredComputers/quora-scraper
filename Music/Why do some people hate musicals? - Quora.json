            "answer_text": "I agree with what everyone else answering this question has said, and as someone who loves musicals, I can break down a number of detailed reasons that people tend to dislike them. Fairy tale musicals. A great many musicals are based directly on fairy tales that are well-known, such as The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, and Aladdin. Even the ones that play around with plot and setting, like Wonderland and Into the Woods, still feel more like something that your 13-year-old homeschooled niece would be into than sophisticated adult productions. Fairy tales not only feel like kid stuff, but since you already know the story there seems to be little point in seeing the musical if you are looking for something nuanced and original.Musicals based on classic stories. More nuanced than fairy tales, but many of us already know what Frankenstein, Dracula, The Count Of Monte Cristo, Les Miserables, The Phantom Of the Opera, and The Scarlet Pimpernel are basically supposed to be about. Or, you know, we can read the books or watch the movies for a tenth of the price of seeing the musical. Even stuff like \u201cCamelot\u201d or \u201cSpamalot\u201d or \u201cBaker Street,\u201d that\u2019s kind of a mash-up of short stories, is still something that we can probably predict the outcome of, that doesn\u2019t feel original.Musicals based on modern books, films, and \u201cjukebox musicals.\u201d So you\u2019ve decided to go outside of the fairy tale/classic lit box, and do something fresh and unpredictable, based on something that enough people care about to be curious about a musical adaptation but not enough care about to say \u201cOh, that again, we\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d Like a movie! (\u201cLittle Shop Of Horrors,\u201d \u201cMean Girls,\u201d \u201cHeathers,\u201d \u201cCatch Me If You Can,\u201d \u201cThe Wedding Singer,\u201d And \u201cShrek,\u201d to name a few.). Or a book! (\u201cWicked,\u201d \u201cHamilton,\u201d \u201cFun Home,\u201d \u201cTuck Everlasting,\u201d \u201cThe Lightning Thief\u201d). Or a comic book! (\u201cFun Home\u201d And \u201cDeath Note\u201d). Or even a TV show! (\u201cThe Addams Family\u201d (which was also a comic), \u201cHappy Days,\u201d \u201cThe Spongebob Musical\u201d). Since they tend to choose stuff that\u2019s not too popular, these can be very successful. But, you still have people who like the book, movie, comic, or show better, and a lot of plot details do sometimes get watered down to look better on stage or fit the musical theatre tropes that audiences have come to expect, there are still a lot of people who won\u2019t be sold on it. And then you have jukebox musicals, in which a bunch of songs by ABBA, Queen, The Who, Green Day, Elvis, or whoever are put into a musical. Sometimes there is a unique story (\u201cMamma Mia!\u201d), and sometimes the results are kind of bizarre (\u201cWe Will Rock You\u201d). If you aren\u2019t a huge fan of Carole King, David Bowie, Bob Dylan, or whatever artist the musical pays tribute to, you probably won\u2019t care for a jukebox musical because they have a hard time standing on their own two feet.At the end of the day... Oh, look, something original. \u201cDear Evan Hansen.\u201d \u201cGrease.\u201d \u201cAnything Goes.\u201d \u201cIn the Heights.\u201d \u201cAvenue Q.\u201d But are they really all that good? Really? Since so many musicals do the same thing over and over again, is it really worth your time and money to see a supposedly \u201coriginal\u201d musical that will still probably pander to the typical Broadway audience? Plus, even if you do kind of like musicals, some of the original stuff is just plain weird. Or offensive. Or both. I mean, look at \u201cBook of Mormon.\u201d Think of all those \u201cartsy, groundbreaking\u201d types of descriptions that evoke images of subtitles, dancing naked in the woods, and creepy bird costumes. Many people are simply sick of the predictability of musicals, but not out-there enough to have a vested interest in pushing the boundaries of an art form. On top of that, among people who like musicals, you have a bunch of folks dedicated to their Classics from the Good Old Days, alongside young, forward-thinking types who want to get Outspoken and Political and Controversial and Groundbreaking. I mean\u2026talk about worlds in tension. (Then again, that is a classic plot device of drama. How ironic. Thanks, IB English Lit HL.). So, for many people who are not particularly interested in music and dancing, musicals do not satisfy the maturity, originality, and depth of plot and character that they desire and have come to expect from other forms of entertainment.",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t hate them, but they aren\u2019t my favorite form of theater (with several exceptions.) For one thing, the premise of the story in so many musicals is quite banal. Girl meets bad boy, shit happens, they end up together. The settings are childish, there\u2019s no real conflict, no world building, no character development beyond the romance. Depending on which play we\u2019re talking about, the music can be be very\u2026.UGH. Oklahoma! springs to mind, with excruciating rhymes and dreadful music (I know, I know, Your Mileage May Vary. It is dreadful to me.) Even a musical I am fond of, with lyrics by Cole Porter, can make me want to stab my ears out. Wunderbar! Wunderbar!We're alone and hand in gloveNot a cloud, near or farWhy, it's more than wunderbar  From: Kiss Me Kate, written by Samuel and Bella Spewack with music and lyrics by Cole Porter. That said, there are a few musicals I have enjoyed. 1776 is an annual rewatch on July 4th. Fun Home was\u2026breathtaking. The music, which won all sorts of Tony Awards, was amazing. Nonetheless, I would not say I am a fan of musicals. That all said, why do you think people \u201chate\u201d musicals? That seems hyperbolic. Most people won\u2019t have an opinion, many people may simply not like them. ",
