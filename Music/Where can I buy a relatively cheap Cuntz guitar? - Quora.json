Move to Germany, for real. the cheapest way. If you buy if from Thomann, you\u2019ll pay painfull shipping. It\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s stopped me from buying a Harley Benton. They have a few really nice SG\u2019s and semi hollow, but I sure as shit won\u2019t pay close to $40 for a ship when I can buy a really nice guitar from Sweetwater and if it hit\u2019s $299, I get a free 55 point inspection, which is basically a free set up, saving me $70 bucks from a luthier. Anyhow, what ever you decide, let us know, I look forward to a follow up. ",
