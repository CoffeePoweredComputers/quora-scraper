            "answer_text": "Question: can i make songs without music? There are two types of answer here. The first is to mention a capella singing, This answer shows that the person answering thinks that music is only the sound that instruments make. That's a too narrow definition of music. The sung parts are part of the music. Even when there are only sung parts, as in a capella singing. A capella singing is a good answer to the question: can I make songs without instruments. Note that it is not the only answer, you could just as well make a song for solo voice. It would not be called a capella until there would be at least a small group of voices. Someone posted the Wikipedia link for a capella, which is a good start, should you like to know more. The second type of answer uses a definition of music that includes singing. With this more comprehensive definition, the question becomes: if I start with a song, and then remove all parts that would qualify as music, would there be anything left? The thought process seems to be: scrap all instruments, so you're only left with sung words. Then take out the melody. Now there is only text. Now you could say what is left is a poem. And then you can discuss whether a poem is music. And maybe bring up that a text that is rapped lacks melody and harmony, but still qualifies as music because it has rhythm. After which you can discover that nearly all poetry has rhythm. Is that all music? All in all this question is a lot more tricky than it seems. It leads straight to the frayed edges of the definitions of the terms music and song. For practical purposes I'd say that yes, you can write a text intended as a song but without any instruction for melody, harmony or rhythm. In theory though, you'd have to say that \u2018a song\u2019 is defined within music, therefore making a song is, by definition, making music. ",

            "answer_text": "I think and feel that what you meant by \u201cCan I make songs without music?\u201d is that if you could \u201cwrite\u201d [make] songs without \u201cmelody\u201d [music]. And, it is true and indeed real that you could write such without the latter. If ever it is not, I have spent a long time discussing the wrong thing, I beg you to forgive me as so. In songwriting, there are three approaches. 1.) Lyrics Pre-Melody This is usually how songwriters start, very basic. You begin writing as if it was \u2018only\u2019 poetry that you are concerned with. You create a story you wish to tell. After doing so, you can find a melody in which each syllable is given a note to be song upon. 2.) Lyrics and Melody This is usually the starting point for musicians who are willing to learn how to write songs. They incorporate a melody for a word or a word for a melody and then everything just gets written and recorded by the flow and tone of the song. In other words, typically, the melody becomes the basis of the tone or voice of the lyrics. 3.) Lyrics Post-Melody Not to be confused with the second one, this approach solely begins with the creation of melody before writing down the lyrics. This is usually easier for musicians to accomplish, unlike the \u2018Lyrics and Melody\u2019 approach where you simultaneously write lyrics while figuring its melody or create the melody while writing down lyrics. TL;DR Yes, you can! ",

If so, it\u2019s like trying to talk with your mouth shut. You just tried that, didn\u2019t you? But anyways, it\u2019s hard - very hard - for people to understand, right? So a song without music is hard to understand, but possible. See: Poems ",

            "answer_text": "So there are some good answers and bad answers here. I\u2019ll put in my two cents just to stir things up. You can write the words to a song without any instruments. You can sing a song in the shower without any instrument but your own voice. There is also songs for which actual words aren\u2019t used, only sounds. (Think of the blue opera singer in the 5th element- yes some music was there but not all the way through.) Then there is writing a song complete with lyrics and music but no instrument. I have done it a few times. They always have to be re-adjusted when I play them the first few times, and a good portion of those end up in the trash. but you can do it. ",

Basically, you can make sounds with your vocal cords and mouth and record all the different forms of it. Record your song separately and then merge and compile the both of them. Viola! A song without using any instruments. Just you and your melodious harmonizing voice. ",
