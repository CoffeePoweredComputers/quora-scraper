            "answer_text": "Both bass and acoustic guitar can be considered the best according to the way its used. If you are a beginner , I recommend you to learn the acoustic guitar first and then move on to the bass guitar. Once you\u2019ve learned the basics of the guitar , then learning the bass would be easier. And the bass guitar is one octave lower than the guitar meaning the notes will be in a lower pitch than the guitar. Bass notes form an integral part in a song and Acoustic guitar is mostly used as for rhythmic chords along with the percussion. ",

I would recommend to start with acoustic guitar and develop you skills, build your interest then explore from there. But this is just my opinion. You should follow what suits your interests. ",
