            "answer_text": "Yes. It would be the highest grossing movie of all time, but since there are already two films that have grossed $3 billion, it is possible that a film could appeal to so many people, especially at today\u2019s higher ticket prices, that it could gross $5 billion. And based on historical precedent, it would probably be directed by James Cameron, LOL! ",

An experience which could only be properly experienced in a new type of theater. Other than that, though, that gross should be reached a little later this century. And the rising fortunes of the middle class of India and Africa virtually guarantees that will happen. They are the last two regions of earth that still have rapidly multiplying - and highly youthful - populations. And India will pass China as the world\u2019s largest country and Africa will pass Asia as the world\u2019s most populous continent. And that will all happen at the same time the fastest growing language in both the country of India and the continent of Africa will be - English. ",
