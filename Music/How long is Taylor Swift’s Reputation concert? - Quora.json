            "answer_text": "As of 9 May Taylor has started the Reputation Tour with at least 24 of her songs in the set list. As with her past tours she has multiple costume change as well as 3 stages so expect about 2\u20133 hours. BUT WAIT, there's more! She Camilla Cabelo and Charlie XCX as openers so overall at least 4 hours I think would be a conservative estimate. Hope this helps. ",

Depending on the venue and weather, Taylor\u2019s set will start between 8:30 and 9 (it was supposed to rain later in the night at my show, so she started earlier because it\u2019s an open air stadium). The show ends between 10:45 and 11:15, depending on when she started. ",
