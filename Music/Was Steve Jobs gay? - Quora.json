            "answer_text": "So most of the other answers saying \u201cWTF? No.\u201d weren't enough for you? Yes, I note the academic saying \u201cjust because he married, fathered multiple children, and had various long-running affairs with women, and dies married with children is not a reliable indicator he is straight\u201d, and that statement is true in the broadest sense of rational thought and the examples of closeted homosexuals throughout history, but it's also rather tone-deaf to the lived experience of Jobs\u2019 actual life, a life massively more observed by so many people than the average person, surrounded by a media who just love a bit of drama to sell media to people who ask questions like yours. Or perhaps you think it's because he handed the reins of Apple to a gay man, who\u2019s continued to successfully run Apple for 5 years after Jobs\u2019 death? Are you imagining steamy homo sex scenes over the board room table, followed by secret videoconference meetings with their Illuminati cohorts? I'm gay, and I'm not, I'm so not seeing that. Having been a casual but long-time observer of Apple, there's never been the slightest twitch in my gaydar about Steve Jobs. ",

            "answer_text": "WHO GIVES A SHIT? The man was brilliant beyond time. I believe he was married and had children but still\u2026\u2026.who cares? Why do you care? He was brilliant and brought us many things..things we all love to own. Hey if he was Gay, do you think he \u201cCHOSE\u201d to be Gay? (that is a joke, no one chooses to be Gay, just like no one chooses to be straight\u2026I felt the need to explain for the gun slayers..on either side) I see on the side of this a slew of questions about Steve Jobs..was he Gay, was he overrated, was he bi-polar, was he technical? Did Steve Jobs ever berate Tim Cook? Read this: Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn't matter to me. Going to bed at night saying we've done something wonderful, that's what matters to me. Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower. Sometimes when you innovate, you make mistakes. It is best to admit them quickly, and get on with improving your other innovations. All said by Steve Jobs\u2026why worry who he slept with\u2026be glad he existed. I love my iPhone and iPad and iPod. Thank you Steve Jobs.. ",
