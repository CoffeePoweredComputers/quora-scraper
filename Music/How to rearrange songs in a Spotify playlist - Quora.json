            "answer_text": "Kevin\u2019s answer is good, but I\u2019ve added a few useful commands. Dekstop: Drag and drop the song. While moving, you will see a green line indicating where it will be inserted. Mobile App: click the \u201c\u2026\u201d button (top right), choose edit and reorder the tracks using the handles on the right. Then click save (top right). Bonus: You can move multiple songs at once by selecting multiple songs and then clicking and dragging one of them to the position. Select multiple songs using the standard Shift or Command/Control method used in most applications. Note: You cannot sort playlists that are currently ordered by artist/title/etc. Click the header until it is in manual order so you can reorder them. ",

For Desktop App: Press and hold the song. Then move it to the place you want. You will see a green line indicating where it will be inserted. P.S. I prefer to reorder them by the title so I usually use AudKit Spotify Downloader to redownload Spotify songs. The downloaded Spotify songs are saved in my local music library for offline playback. ",
