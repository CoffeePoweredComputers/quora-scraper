            "answer_text": "First of all you have to really want to make beats, like it can be fun but you should have some kind of passion about music, that\u2019s all you need really. Next get a you a laptop/computer and get a DAW(Digital Audio Worstation) My suggestion is FL studio because that\u2019s what i use and it hasn\u2019t disappointed me in 14 years. Most or all the major DAW\u2019s come with free inbuilt/ stock sounds that should get you started and build inspiration from there as you go along you would either get better or stop doing it. People usually say you must know how to play an instrument, but i run a successful side business selling beats online and i don\u2019t play any instruments.There are no rules to making beats just have good ears, listen for new things on the radio and attempt making them pay attention and be smart. Good luck ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the a2a! I\u2019d say start with something simple: using a pre-recorded sound you like and adding in another sound you like. Software like GarageBand will be a way to start, although you can search for \u201cfree music making software\u201d online or \u201cfree beatmaking software\u201d over time you\u2019ll learn what sounds good together and will make better sounding music. if you take lessons on an instrument or for voice this will help. If you get lessons and/or collaborate on beat making this will help too Lastly I\u2019d ask: why do you want to make beats? There are many free beats for you to use online if you\u2019re looking to write lyrics and/or sing lf creative expression is what you\u2019re after then good luck! ",
