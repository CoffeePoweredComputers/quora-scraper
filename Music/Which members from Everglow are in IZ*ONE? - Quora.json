            "answer_text": "No one. Part of IZ*One\u2019s contract terms is that the members can\u2019t promote with any other group while part of IZ*One. And Everglow debuted after IZ*one did so there are currently no girl who is in both groups. Everglow\u2019s company, YueHua Ent. sent 3 girls to compete on produce 48: Sihyeon, Yiren, and Yena. Yena ranked in the top 12 during the finale of the show and thus debuted as a member of IZ*one. The other two returned to the company and debuted with Everglow a few months after IZ*One. Judging by how soon after the show ended Everglow debuted, its very very likely Yena was part of the lineup for the group. But because of contract obligations to IZ*One, she cannot join Everglow for the time being. There\u2019s a good chance YueHua will add her to the group once IZ*One disbands but that\u2019s another year and a half so who knows? They may just debut Yena as a soloist instead. ",
