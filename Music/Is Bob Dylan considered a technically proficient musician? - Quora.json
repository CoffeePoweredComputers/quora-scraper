            "answer_text": "He was as good as he needed to be. As Joe Geronimo Martinez said, the guitar was an accompaniment. Dylan comes from a folk tradition in which the words were more important than the instrument that accompanied them. Unlike the people often considered Dylan's contemporaries, he didn't practice the guitar all day long, he wrote lyrics.  Dylan's disregard for his own musical desires and abilities was showcased recently in the Never Ending Tour that he's been on since 1988. A few years ago Dylan stopped playing guitar in his shows and switched to playing the keyboards. His reason for this when asked was that he needed some basic chords played to anchor the music and felt bad asking a professional keyboard player to tour with him to do something so simple. So he did it himself.  He gave up the guitar to spend every night playing basic chords. Lately he's even taken to just standing in front of stage and singing without an instrument at all. ",

            "answer_text": "His timing is good, but he's always been a somewhat sloppy guitar player.     Most of the leads heard on his records over the last several decades are not played by Dylan, but by skilled lead players. Dylan was a good finger picker when he started.    For example, check out \"Don't Think Twice,\" and \"Girl From the North Country.\"    Later he switched to mostly rhythm guitar on electric.      His talent is imagination and songwriting.    I don't think he's ever thought of himself as a great lead guitarist. But as a creator of music-with-lyrics, he's legendary for having written dozens of truly great compositions.    My favorites are \"Hard Rain's Gonna Fall,\" \"Gates of Eden,\" and \"It's Alright Ma, I\"m Only Bleeding.\" ",
