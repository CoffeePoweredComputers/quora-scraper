            "answer_text": "\u201cBetter\u201d is always subjective to discuss or ask about. With that out of the way. Eddie was/is by far more innovative than Slash and (to me) a far better technical player than Slash ever could hope to be. Not saying Slash is \u201cbad\u201d but he didn\u2019t innovate on the guitar like Eddie did with tapping and with sounds as Eddie did. Slash also did not have the technique Eddie had. I also don\u2019t think Slash was nearly as accomplished a rhythm player as Eddie. You have to understand Eddie was basically playing in a power trio with a frontman. Lots of ground to cover there especially live. Slash always had a second guitarist helping hold down the rhythm. I believe if you stacked them up song riff for song riff too \u2026that Eddie\u2019s would be more impressive overall. These are just some of the obvious things that come to mind for me thinking of the two of them. To me\u2026Eddie being the pioneer that he was and the sheer number of people who still try to emulate him puts him in a different class than Slash. ",

Slash is somewhere down the list at 300+. I\u2019ve seen all the above and Slash and at 300+ I\u2019m being kind. Frankly he sucks and doesn\u2019t deserve to be in the same sentence with EVH. ",
