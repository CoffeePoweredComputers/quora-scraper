            "answer_text": "The wheel of time does not stop for anyone. It keeps on moving forward no matter what happens but yes many other things change when you die. Death is only truth of life, everything else is just temporary. Your life is basically controlled by time. You can't go back in time or go ahead of others. You can't even stop a moment and cherish it for some more time. Everything passes away time so you are basically bounded by time. You don't even have control on your own physical or mental growth. You mature as the time passes by. So consider death as a pathway which will lead you to your freedom. It makes you strings less and nothing will stop you after that not even time. You will be far away from the controlling hands of cruel time. You\u2019ll be limitless and you will be the master of your own. You won't have this physical form to make you weak, you will feel powerful and invincible. Nature gives each of us an opportunity of death after living our life to be a part of something indestructible (suicide is not the way though because that's you going against the wish of nature). So don't be afraid of death , it\u2019ll help in beating your strongest competitor of this life,time. ",

World changes every second because, it is made of the 5 elements namely Earth, Water, Sky, Air and Fire. This Universe is called Prapanchamu in telugu , which means pra (very huge or majestic) + panchamu ( made of 5 elements ), so it changes every minute and never stops !! ",
