            "answer_text": "Any piece for solo violin or Violin Duos, Concertos, Sonatas, Caprices. Also String Quartets. I reccomend Niccol\u00f3 Paganini - if you are not already familiar with him, he was the first GREAT violin virtuoso, lived around the 18th century, also a very skilled guitarist and a great composer - every violinist should know him - famous for his 24 Caprices, but listen to his beautiful 6 Violin Concertos and his Violin Sonatas and String Quartets too. Do not bother watching \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Violinist\u201d - try instead \u201cPaganini\u2019s Daemon - A most Enduring Legend\u201d which is a serious documentary as opposed to the cheesy movie I mentioned above, for an introduction. I also reccomend lots of Bach, Wieniawski, George Enescu, Ysaye, Fritz Kreisler, Sarasate. The list would be huge but you will certainly find more as you watch on Youtube. Do not waste time with bad violinists there are many and some are famous, but they may ruin a great piece without giving you a chance to understand it. Listen to brilliant violinists: Jascha Heifetz, Yehudi Menuhin, David Oistrakh, Leonid Kogan, Salvatore Accardo, Ruggierio Ricci, Pinchas Zukkermann, Itzak Perlman, Gerhard Taschner, Vasa Prihoda, Alexis Galp\u00e9rine, Christian Ferras. The player is as important as the music - bad players can ruin even the greatest music. The violin is capable of emitting a huge range of emotions, the great violinists I mentioned above know how to emit that emotion - it is always a complex mix of emotions, positive and negative, mixed together in the most masterful ways. If only positive emotion is emitted through the violin, even the greatest music loses its power - no tension means no interest. I suggest this: DO NOT waste time with the likes of Hillary Hahn (good technique but soulless and robotic playing) or David Garrett (diabetes causing sugar coated topped with more sugar style performance oh yeah and he even carelessly tripped and fell over a precious Stradivarius violin which was of course repaired but will never ever sound like a Strad again). You need the greatest artists to look up to and the most diverse classical music playlist (usually but not exclusively focusing on your instrument) if you want to succeed with the violin. ",
