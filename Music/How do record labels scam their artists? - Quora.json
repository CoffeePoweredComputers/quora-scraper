            "answer_text": "Your word \u201cscam\u201d is interesting. There are certainly cases where labels and management scam an artist. But I think most often, it\u2019s a case of leverage and fine print, as well as a combination of the artist wanting the break and willing to sign anything for it. Record labels have 2 real advantages that artists want to take use: Money (financing) and marketing (again, with money/financing). When artists get \u201cscammed,\u201d MOST times (not all) it\u2019s because they have great success of an album and start to see they\u2019re not earning that much money from it. So they feel scammed. The truth to MOST situations is that the label fronted money for dozens of artists who barely (or never) made their money back, or are still trying to. So when one does well, they\u2019re making back their money from past losses. Once an artist has a following, marketing is less valuable to the artist. You can more easily get a song on radio (which still is a big factor of new songs) as an established artist than a new one. Once an artist has money, they don\u2019t need the financing. However, most artist (and people for that matter) when they receive a windfall of money don\u2019t spend it wisely and prepare for the future. Instead, they buy a big house, cars, etc. Look at artists like Aimee Mann, and outside the music world George Lucas. Aimee Mann\u2019s early albums did well, and she saved her money. When the label was bought, and the new label shelved her album, she bought her way out of the deal and has self-released her music ever since, funded her own tours, etc. I\u2019m sure she has access to funds should she need them, but she\u2019s not leveraging her entire career on a record deal. George Lucas has an equivalent film deal with the first Star Wars, though he kept merchandizing (a new thing back then). After the success of the first one, he used that money to finance the second one and never looked back. He wasn\u2019t beholden to a movie company any more because he had access to the funds and marketing for the next movie. SCAM it is not (usually), but read the fine print and decide for yourself what you\u2019re willing to sell for popularity (purposefully didn\u2019t use the word \u201csuccess\u201d). ",

            "answer_text": "Well, if the musician is an emerging artist the record labels could take advantage of them with their contract terms because the artist doesn't have much leverage to negotiate with. Maybe they'll ask for the rights to their music or take a huge percentage of the sale royalties, etc. They can simply tell the artists \u201cTake it or leave it!\u201d and the musicians will not have much choice if they want to get signed. If the musician is an established artist though, he will have a lot more leverage when negotiating the contract term. There are also a lot of new, independent, small record labels out there who offer young, new bands and musicians to distribute their music and promote it but for a price. The artist has to pay a certain amount to the label in advance to be taken into consideration for that label. Since there are a lot of musicians who think signing for a label is the only way to succeed, they become desparate and accept those kind of crazy contract terms. However, there is always the option of doing it independently and not rely on record labels at all or at least not until you are a more recognised artist with a lot more leverage when negotiating a contract with the label. Hope this helps a little. Kind regards ",
