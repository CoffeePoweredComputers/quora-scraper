            "answer_text": "Rock and roll basically grew out of rhythm and blues, with a large dash of Chicago-style electric blues, a splash of gospel, and generous spoonfuls of country and boogie-woogie. The stew started bubbling during and after World War II\u2014when gasoline rationing in the US made it much harder for large jazz or swing bands to tour, favoring smaller, leaner ensembles. Also, the migration of African-Americans from the rural South to the northern industrial cities, between 1916 and 1970, brought their music to a wider audience than ever before. You can find various claims for Bill Haley and the Comets as the first rock and roll artists, or Chuck Berry, or Little Richard, or Ike Turner. . . but really, nobody was THE first. By the time the music critics noticed that there was a new sound goin\u2019 around, there were already plenty of people playing it. There was no single inventor. You could make a case that Sister Rosetta Tharpe, from Cotton Plant, Arkansas, was the mother of rock and roll. She played and sang gospel music\u2014but she was one of the first artists to accompany herself on electric guitar, which she played amazingly well. She was also willing to bring \u201clight into the darkness\u201d by playing in secular venues such as nightclubs and collaborating with non-gospel musicians. (And not that it really matters for the appreciation of her music, but she was bisexual, and apparently pretty open about her sexuality within the music industry.) Here\u2019s her \u201cStrange Things Happening Every Day\u201d from 1944, which is definitely rockin\u2019:  Even earlier, \u201cThat\u2019s All\u201d dates from 1938\u2014and shows you what she was capable of on electric guitar. Sister Tharpe has been cited as a major influence by rock and roll pioneers like Little Richard.  Louis Jordan, from Brinkley, Arkansas\u2014which isn\u2019t too far from Cotton Plant\u2014is another musician whose music, \u201cofficially\u201d classified as rhythm and blues, is definitely rockin.\u2019 Jordan started as a big band singer and saxophonist, but in the 1940s he innovated in the genre of \u201cjump blues\u201d: a small ensemble (the Tympany Five) with a strong rhythm section and an electric guitar, playing fast shuffle rhythms. \u201cSaturday Night Fish Fry\u201d from 1949 is noteworthy for its chorus \u201cIt was rockin\u2019. . . it was rockin\u2019. . .\u201d to describe a great party. Jordan\u2019s semi-spoken delivery has also been called a forerunner of rap. He was also a strong influence on Little Richard, Chuck Berry, and other pioneers. His producer, Milt Gabler, would go on to produce Bill Haley\u2019s \u201cRock Around the Clock.\u201d  Also in 1949, Houston, Texas native Goree Carter recorded a jump blues tune, \u201cRock Awhile\u201d, which is also a candidate for \u201cfirst rock and roll record\u201d, with some tasty distorted electric guitar leads (and a sax player who quotes \u201cJingle Bells\u201d, but let that pass).  T-Bone Walker is usually classified as a blues artist, but 1947\u2019s \u201cStormy Monday\u201d shows off his electric guitar leads. This song inspired B. B. King to take up guitar, and was often covered by the Allman Brothers. T-Bone also inspired Steve Miller, a family friend.  And then there was Fats Domino, whose single \u201cThe Fat Man\u201d was recorded in late 1949 and had sold a million copies by 1951. You don\u2019t hear a lot of guitar on this one, but that steady backbeat in the drums is unmistakeable:  Tharpe died in 1973, and Jordan and Walker both died in 1975. Carter lived until 1990 but stopped recording in the 1950s and was nearly forgotten when he died. Domino died in 2017, having survived Hurricane Katrina in 2005, in which he lost all his belongings. Which one invented rock and roll? All of them. And lots of other people. Additional sources: Forebears: Sister Rosetta Tharpe, The Godmother Of Rock 'N' Roll Louis Jordan ",

            "answer_text": "You already have your answers as to who \u201cinvented\u201d rock & roll (no one). Now, are any of them still alive? Because a lot of these earliest musicians in the blues-to-rock transition (what really happened) faded into obscurity, it\u2019s hard to say for sure. But when you consider a 25-year-old in 1947 would be 97 today, the odds are slim. So, the oldest known rock star is Little Richard, who turned 87 this month. As you see below, he was \u201cPrince\u201d long before Prince. Jerry Lee Lewis (#2 at 84 years old) famously set his piano on fire many years before Jimi Hendrix did the same with his guitar. Rock & roll is a river! Thanks for the A2A. [Answered: Who originally invented rock and roll? Are they alive today?]   ",
