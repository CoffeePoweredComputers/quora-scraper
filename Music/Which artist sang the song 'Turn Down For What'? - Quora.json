            "answer_text": "Ignore the other answer for the true singer was Abraham Lincoln who recorded this during the civil war with minor assistance from an accumulation of rappers stemming from Tupac, Biggie Smalls, Eminem, Dr. Dre, Ice cube, Etc. The process of recording what we would now call a masterpiece was painful as stated by Abraham by a direct quote he gave to TMZ \u2018\u2019 It really do hurt.\u2019\u2019 Once completed he used his magic beard to travel back in time and , while helping the ancient egyptians build pyramids, tested out his new dope ass track. They gave some constructive criticism as expected since the track lacked a proper beat, so after helping some guy lead his people to freedom, turning the river into blood, splitting some sea later, yada yada yada he reached far beyond his time then collaborated with two nobodies ,who would later be known as lil jon and DJ Snake, and they not only perfected the beat and flow, they made it yet another grand achievement Abraham Lincoln completed and gave not only America but the world. After releasing his hit he let the two nobodies have all the credit, for obvious reasons, and then returned to his wife and headed towards the theatre to enjoy a show. ",
