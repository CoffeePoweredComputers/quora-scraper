            "answer_text": "What should Christian Native Americans do in this scenario? My Native family is almost entirely devout Christians at this point (with a few odd agnostics or atheists thrown into the mix). For example, should my direct ancestor apologize for being a proponent of Christianity and preaching about this religion to his fellow tribesmen in their indigenous language? Is he to blame too\u2026for converting folks to Christianity? Or, should modern descendant apologize for him? Should I apologize for my Christian Native family as an atheist? But, if you feel bad enough about the past actions of Christians and have enough critical thinking skills to research and question these deeper issues, why don\u2019t you simply abandon this Abrahamic religion altogether?

            "answer_text": "I think it's a tremendous oversimplification to lay all or most of the responsibility for the forced conversion of Native Americans at the feet of a broad category such as American Christians. Historically speaking, the bulk of forced conversion efforts were undertaken by Spanish and French Catholics, in addition to English Puritans. None of these movements bear direct relation to the various stripes of Protestantism practiced in the modern U.S. and which account for roughly 50% of those in this country who identify themselves as Christians.  If you truly feel some sense of religious or cultural guilt over this, then look for opportunities to perform mission-based service opportunities in care of Native American groups. My own local church does quite a bit of service work for a couple of different nearby pueblos. Look for chances to do the same, and don't hesitate to impart the Gospel to Natives in a loving and Christ-like way in spite of misguided historical efforts to do the same. ",
