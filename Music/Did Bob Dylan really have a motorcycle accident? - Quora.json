I just can\u2019t remember the name of the book but it\u2019s a dandy. Dylan was not an experienced rider and it just got away from him. Thank goodness he wasn\u2019t seriously injured. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, in 1966. The fact that the accident happened is not in question. Everything else about it, the circumstances, severity, injuries, etc, are though. From reconstructions it seems likely he was not severely hurt, he was not admitted to a hospital but spent a month at a friendly doctor\u2019s house, but needed time to mentally recover and possibly took the opportunity to reflect on his life and career. There\u2019s a lot of intersting information, interviews, opinions and conjecture in this article: Bob Dylan's 1966 Motorcycle Accident: What Really Happened? ",
