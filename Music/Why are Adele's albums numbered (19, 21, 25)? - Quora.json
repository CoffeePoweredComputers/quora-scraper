            "answer_text": "Adele named her albums after her age. But she admits that she would do away with her system of naming albums after her age. But the funny thing is that she was 20 when 19 came out, was 23 when 21 came out and was 27 when 25 came out, but she quite liked the album at the age of \u201c25\u201d, it\u2019s weird, agreed, but who cares when the music is amazing!!

Now I can see by the other answers it was because she was 19, 21 and 25 when she wrote those albums. Good job she wasn\u2019t making albums when she was a kid, because they\u2019d have been called 5 and three quarters or 7 and a half or something. ",
