            "answer_text": "Well I can\u2019t say a specific name, however to me it\u2019s somebody that just takes the role not goes up on it. Never be there for the members or give encouragement talks to the group. I never seen those qualities in a group before, however there is more leadership than others no doubt and sometimes they don\u2019t know what to do to and that their just place with that role. It can be extra pressure for them and it\u2019s not easy. ",
