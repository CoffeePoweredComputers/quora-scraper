            "answer_text": "Sparks, an American duo consisting of two siblings (Ron and Russell Mael), who were fascinated by the British glam rock scene. In 1974 they even proposed to Brian May joining them, arguing that \u201cQueen are obviously washed up\u201d (true story). Try \u201cKimono my house\u201d and \u201cPropaganda\u201d. You\u2019ll find similarities, especially in the vocal harmonies and the overall eccentricity. 10cc, a British quasi-prog band from the 70s, whose music had an element of parody and self-parody that was also apparent in Queen\u2019s contemporary music. I remember reading that when an acclaimed music journalist (I can\u2019t recall his name) put \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d in his office for the first time (late 1975), his colleagues thought it was 10cc. Personally, I don\u2019t really like them, they are too tongue-in-cheek for my taste, but it is worth exploring them nonetheless. Led Zeppelin, who need no introduction. Queen are mostly remembered for their Britishness, the operatic vocals and their larger-than-life attitude on stage, but we tend to forget that in the 70s their music had also this quite heavy aspect, which was mainly manifested in their live performances (but not exclusively; listen to the studio versions of \u201cModern times rock n\u2019 roll\u201d, \u201cOgre battle\u201d, \u201cStone cold crazy\u201d, \u201cDeath on two legs\u201d, \u201cWhite man\u201d etc.). Just listen to their Rainbow concerts in 1974 or the Hyde Park concert in 1976. This is the definition of early heavy metal to me. Have a nice day :) ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a good question. First, you do not owe anyone to listen something. Queen has been my favorite band since childhood, but I also listen to a wide roster of bands starting from Black Sabbath to some grindcore to death metal; also I\u2019m a big opera lover, that also implies to classical music. Among my favorite artists are underground hip-hop ones, minimal electronic music, IDM, etc etc etc. What I\u2019m trying to say, is that you should listen to whatever you like, whatever gives you kicks. Queen created a separate niche in music genre-wise, that\u2019s why there are no bands like it. I only can say the same about Pink Floyd, they are also unique. Queen made me go to musical school and explore music deeper, Slash was my inspiration for self-learning electric guitar quite alright. Music needs to be explored, I listen to ten or more albums from new bands every day just to know what\u2019s going on. Rarely some great artist in pop music, like Amy Winehouse a long time ago. So my answer would be \u2014 check out everything, listen to whatever you like. ",
