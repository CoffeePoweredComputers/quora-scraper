            "answer_text": "That depends on what kind of keyboardist you are. Considering they are different type of keyboard. Xp series are line of old school synths while Bk series are somewhat modern arranger keyboards. As far as musical contect they operate differently and require different approach in playing. If you are playing with the band, and likes to craft your own sound (like guitarists) den the XP 30 will do for you. If you are a composer and needs to turn your ideas into music quickly, and also plays alone den rhe BK 5 is well suited for you. Remember that playing piano sounds is always possible in any of that keyboards, although the XP 30 can be quite more realistic because of weighted keys. Also remember that the XP 30 has far more preset sounds and it is also expandable. What the xp lacks is the backing auto accompaniment band that is the main feature of arrangers like the bk5. ",
