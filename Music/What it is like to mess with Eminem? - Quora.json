            "answer_text": "Anyone who is a slim shady fan knows about his beef with Ja rule,Benzino,Mariah Carey to name a few. Ja rule\u2019s beef was essentially with 50 cent. In one track Ja rule crossed limits and called out Em\u2019s daughter Hailie : \u201cEm you claim your mothers a crackhead and Kim is a known slut/ so what\u2019s Hailie gonna be when she grows up?\u201d After this Eminem with his D12 subordinates went on an all out rampage with \u201cDoe Rae me/Hailie\u2019s revenge\u201d. This track sort of ended Ja Rule\u2019s career. What\u2019s funny is that Em was just on the hook of this song. Now imagine the wrath if Eminem had done a verse in it.Some notable lyrics from the track: Look at what the fuck you dun got intoI see you found your nitch you're just a bitch with a menstralClaiming you a murderer and spelt it wrongYou put the \"E\" before the \"D\" because that's all you on.  Benzino/The source vs. Eminem \u2018The source\u2019 which was one of the most iconic rap magazines in 2000s,in which Benzino was the co founder,greeted Em\u2019s sophomore album \u2018The Marshall Mathers Lp\u2019 with a comical 2/5 mics.Then Benzino dropped a diss track \u201cI don\u2019t wanna\u201d and from there things heated up. Shots were fired from both sides,Em then came out with \u201cThe Sauce\u201d and Benzino dropped \u201cPull your skirt up\u201d . In \u201cPull your skirt up\u201d,Benzino raps: \u201cI birthed your little career now you owe your life to Ray\u201d. The feud concluded with Em\u2019s \u201cNail in the coffin\u201d,which is crowned as one of the best diss records of all time.Notable lyrics: I would never claim to be no Ray Benzinoan 83 year old fake PachinoSo how can he hold me over some balconywithout throwin his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift mePlease dont, youl probably fall with meand our asses will both be historyBut then again youl'll finally get your wishcuz youl be all over the street like 50 Cent (It\u2019s funny as hell!)  Eminem vs. Mariah carey For the better part of the last decade,there was a conflict between Em and Mariah because Mariah denied her relationship with Eminem while Em disagrees with her.The story of these two taking digs at each other went on and on. Em ended it with his diss in \u201cThe warning\u201d. Notable lyrics: How many times you fly to my house, still tryin to countBetter shut your lyin mouth if you don't want Nick findin outYou probably think cause it's been so longif I had somethin on you I woulda did it by nowOh on the contrary Mary Poppins I'm mixin our studio session downand sendin it to masterin to make it loudEnough dirt on you to murder youThis is what the fu*k I do, Mariah it ever occur to youthat I still have pictures? However you prefer to doand that goes for Nick too, fa*got you think I'm scurred of you?You're gonna ruin my career you better get oneLike I'ma sit and fight with you over some slut bit*h cu*t  Eminem has dissed many celebrities,like Christina aguileraIggy azaleaBritney spearsthe list goes on and on. But those who have messed with the \u201cRAP GOD\u201d were severely bruised with words.Their careers were almost finished and that\u2019s supposed to happen when you mess with the \u201cRAP GOD\u201d.
