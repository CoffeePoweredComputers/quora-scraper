            "answer_text": "I don't believe it's possible to single out one individual as most influential. Do we choose Charles Babbage for showing that a machine could perform complex calculations? Ada Lovelace, arguably the world's first computer programmer? Do we choose George Boole for creating Boolean algebra? Alan Turing? (Too many achievements to list here but the Turing machine theory is a big one) Tommy Flowers and his team for the first digital computer? Shockley and his team for the transistor? Federico Faggin for the microprocessor? The above are just the names that I came up with off the top of my head, I'm sure there are many others I've missed who made important contributions (graphical user interfaces might be very different if not for work done by Xerox at their PARC facility for example).
