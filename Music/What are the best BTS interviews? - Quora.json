            "answer_text": "Sometimes Quora takes down answers if they have links in them, so I won\u2019t be linking them here. But they\u2019re all easily found on Youtube :) Firstly, one of my ALL TIME FAVOURITE western interviews with BTS - The Zach Sang Show interview. This was around the time of the first big Western buzz around BTS. Most Western interviews went along the lines of, \u2018wHo iS yOuR CelEbRiTY cRUsH?\u2019 (super uncomfortable for the boys and almost unwatchable). However, Zach\u2019s interview was a breath of fresh air! Zach asks meaningful questions, the boys seem very comfortable, and in general it\u2019s a very respectful and genuine interview. Zach even talks about their UNIEF endeavours, and Namjoon thanks him, saying he\u2019s the first one to mention this. Search on Youtube: \u2018BTS Backstage at the AMAs Zach Sang Show\u2019 Secondly, and these are ones I cannot recommend enough, both of the Liam McEwan interviews for J-14 Magazine. Like Zach, Liam brings genuine sincerity and thoughtfulness to his interviews, and you can see so clearly how happy the boys are in both of Liam\u2019s interviews. He has the perfect mix of humour, and more serious questions. Search on Youtube: \u2018J-14 BTS Gets Real About Their New Album\u2019Search on Youtube: \u2018J-14 BTS International Success, Music, Charity\u2019 The next one is on the other end of the scale, but still as enjoyable to watch. BTS with the Mess! Chaotic, energetic, and full of laughs. This isn\u2019t in any way a serious interview, but it\u2019s so heartwarming to watch the boys relax and laugh with the animated hosts, and even learn a new dance move with them. In particular, Tae really enjoys this one. He\u2019s almost in tears from laughing so much. Search on Youtube: \u2018Watch BTS Band Members Profess Their Love For Usher, Zedd and More!\u2019 An \u201cinterview\u201d that\u2019s completely different for the others I\u2019ve mentioned so far - a comeback interview hosted by Jungkook himself, for Blood Sweat and Tears. This is absolutely ridiculous and so fun to watch. The members keep setting each other off laughing - they test Suga\u2019s needlework, make Jin cry on demand, show off the rapline\u2019s singing abilities, and more. I don\u2019t know whether you can count this as an interview or not, but it\u2019s hilarious and definitely deserves a spot on this list. Search on Youtube: \u2018161025 The Show News BTS part 1 [ENG SUB]\u2019Search on Youtube: \u2018161025 The Show News BTS part 2 [ENG SUB]\u2019 This last one\u2019s short and sweet, but probably my favourite \u2018mainstream TV\u2019 interview that they\u2019ve done so far: The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. Jimin and Jimmy are adorable, all the members\u2019 styling is top-notch, Jimmy has great chemistry with the boys and overall, I was really impressed considering it was a mainstream interview. They managed to cover the important things in the time they had, and it was very very watchable (unlike some other interviews they\u2019re had on TV). Jimmy really made the boys feel at home. Search on Youtube: \u2018Jimmy Interviews the Biggest Boy Band on the Planet BTS\u2019 I\u2019ll add more if I think of any! ",
