            "answer_text": "I am still amateur and never take voice lessons, too, but I personally think your voice is very good! You have natural talent in singing and musical interpretation. You can sing most of the tunes with precision (only a little flat and very slightly off-tempo in certain part, but I might be wrong), and also, you can sing them with great emotion as like Adele and Amy Winehouse, but with your own musical style. This is a very good starting point. There might be not much singers that have natural talent like you have, so you have to be really proud of that (I think I might envy your good voice and tone, haha). If you haven't got the chance to afford vocal lessons yet, maybe you're interested in joining a local choir or going to karaoke with your friends. The choir will be very pleased to have you join them. Choir is also very inexpensive compared to vocal lessons. The choir members will support you, and you can learn many things from there. Karaoke is a good way to show your talent and express yourself to your friends, while also be able to ask their opinion about your voice. I, myself, find out that I have singing talent from my friend's opinion while karaokeing, and since then pursue singing as my hobby and passion. Keep singing and broaden your talent. You might be a great vocalist someday, who knows? I wish all the best for you, and good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "You have a nice voice and a good sense of musicality. Instead of just hitting notes, I can hear some decent phrasing that will only get better right there. I agree that there are a few pitchy places, but that will only be polished with training because your overall inner hearing is pretty good. I think overall this is a good start. Training will only make you a better singer, so go for it! All the best and do not listen to anybody trying to stop you - you have potential! ",
