It has been recorded subsequently by several artists, but Stick wrote it and sang it for years. Pass that bottle to me. In that same glorious year at the prelude to the 50s, a group called the Dominos recorded Sixty Minute Man\u201d about\u201dold Dan\u201d, who could \u201crock \u2018em,roll \u2018em, all night long, he\u2019s the sixty minute man\u201d. ( You did know what rock and roll meant, didn\u2019t you? No, Elvis didn\u2019t invent anything. He built on the black sound of Stickand Little Richard andChuck Berry, and blended a little Hillbilly from Earl Monroe and others, to merge with Carl Perkins rockabilly style. He never wrote a song, and he stole the knock kneed hip grinding from the dirty shag crowd that made \u201cbeach music\u201d in South Carolina. But boy, , could he sell it. He added a sneer, and an attitude, and a sexuality that nobody could match. Elvis invented Elvis, which took Rock and Roll to the masses. ",

Artists like Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Bob Wills, Bill Haley, Joe Hill Louis, and Harmonica Frank Floyd were rocking well before Elvis. As a matter of fact, Harmonica Frank Floyd was the inspiration for Sam Phillips to find another white guy who could perform black music. What Elvis brought to the table was that element of commercialism. Sister Rosetta Tharpe was a gospel performer. Can\u2019t serve both God and Mammon. Bob Wills, Bill Haley and Harmonica Frank Floyd were all older folks. Kids aren\u2019t gonna buy a record that looks like their dad made it. And Joe Hill Louis the world just plain wasn\u2019t ready for. Elvis had the looks, he had the voice and he fit the role that Sam Phillips needed at that exact moment. And what the Rock N\u2019 Roll movement needed at that exact moment. ",

Bill Haley did it before him but Bill Haley looked like this\u2026  Haley was a massive success in the UK up until the point where toured. Most artists increase their appeal when they do concerts but Haley killed his fanbase when he showed up. When the fans saw Haley and his band and realised that they were older, overweight and not very sexy, they turned off their music. He had a string of top ten hits in the UK before he toured but none afterwards. Elvis added sex appeal to rock and roll and created the rock star. ",
