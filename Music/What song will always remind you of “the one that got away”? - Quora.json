            "answer_text": "OYG! I've got dozens in probably every genre. I'll try to be brief considering that you only asked for one. Right off the bat, Even Now by Barry Manilow, but my roots usually run country. I've almost gotten swept away in the Whiskey River by Willie Nelson (live version). She Used to Love Me a Lot by David Allen Coe knows the heartache of seeing her walk away. While I'm still in Outlaw mode, I feel that Waylon's Wurlitzer Prize definitely deserves honorable mention as well as Merle Haggard's Looking For a Place to Fall Apart. I don't know why, but I've always favored male singers and I feel that I need to add some women. There's nothing worse than losing your man and knowing that \u201cShe's\u201d Got You, while you're stuck with all the baubles as reminders, Patsy Cline knew that feeling. Bonnie Riatt's I Can't Make You Love Me is another good one. But like I said, I'm more into male singers. There are a few by Randy Travis, Old 8x10 and a bit more upbeat, Is it Still Over?, Old Habits by Hank Jr., Don Williams taught me that Some Broken Hearts Never Mend, while the Eagles made me worry about Wasted Time and being a Victim of Love. Mark Wills came out (of seemingly nowhere to me) with a few songs that made me feel like I grew up with him. The most popular is 19Something but that doesn't apply here, What Hurts The Most does. To be thatclose, but then BAM, it's over. There's a song from the 70s called What's Forever For by Michael Martin Murphy that pondered why people bother to fall in love in the first place if it's only going to end in heartache. It's a little sappy, but it's still a beautiful song. Speaking of sappy but great, the late great George Michael imagined that if his lover had only turned A Different Corner and they'd never met, \u201cwould you care\u2026.\u201d and in very eloquent and clever wording George showed us the shame of Kissing A Fool. For some happier songs on the same subject. Ronnie Milsap's I Wouldn't Have Missed It For The World. Bob Seger Trying to Live My Life Without You (live), Merle's I think I'll Just Stay Here and Drink and the ever popular I Keep Forgetting (We're Not in Love Anymore) by Michael McDonald. I'll leave you with the saddest song in Rock &Roll history. Love Hurts by Nazareth. It says it all. I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201c It\u2019s different for girls \u201c Joe Jackson.  Nearly 40 years after the fact, I am still unable to listen to any Joe Jackson, this particular track, not even as a cover version. When the knife cuts you that deep, the wounds never heals, the pain never stops and it bleeds for the rest of your life. We may sit glued to watch \u201c The Walking Dead\u201d never realizing we are in fact the walking wounded. ",
