It doesn\u2019t make sense for her to wear this, especially since rollin rollin was a very cute and upbeat song.   I honestly don\u2019t even know why she chose this song, I mean, she knows English. But, like many of us, she probably just didn\u2019t pay close attention to the lyrics   For these, idk if she chose to wear this outfit, but, I hate to think that older men are looking at her in this. ik that she isn\u2019t the only idol that goes through this, and it breaks my heart to think that there are younger idols who are being sexualized.

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re looking for some real creepy stuff, this ain\u2019t it lol but:  The girl holding the tissue is AOA\u2019s Jimin, and the one checking on her is AOA\u2019s Mina. I feel it\u2019s disturbing because despite Mina having such a kind heart towards Jimin (even if we were just shown this particular moment), Jimin bullied Mina for 10 years to the point Mina considered suicide. There are countless pictures and videos showing how Jimin mistreated Mina over the years, but the way Mina is just a caring girl with a kind heart is so\u2026 I love her. Again, this ain\u2019t some deep stuff you gotta decipher, but anyway, support Mina :) Edit: So a comment below by D. Jasmine told me that Mina had actually recently attempted suicide, but was rushed to the hospital. I remember reading an article that said she had posted questionable pictures on Instagram and that\u2019s what made them check on her. ",
