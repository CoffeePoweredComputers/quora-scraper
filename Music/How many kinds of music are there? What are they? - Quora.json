            "answer_text": "Seems to me there\u2019s only two types of music: good and bad. Regardless of genre, music must appeal to the senses and the emotions in some way. If it doesn\u2019t succeed, then for you it is bad. However, and it\u2019s a big \u2018however\u2019, we are not all made the same way in terms of our emotional responses (I know, I\u2019m stating the obvious) so what appeals to one person may not appeal to another. For myself, popular music must possess a good melody or at least have words that express feeling*. There have been masters of this kind of thing over the last century, for a few examples Rodgers and Hart, Rodgers and Hammerstein, Irving Berlin, George and Ira Gershwin, Cole porter, Burt Bacharach and Hal David. Then there\u2019s the performer who can lift what might with the average singer become a mediocre song and turn it into a classic. An example of this is \u2018That\u2019s All\u2019, as sung by Frank Sinatra. I\u2019ve read somewhere or other that this song was considered to be one of the finest ever written, yet if you ignore the singer\u2019s performance and listen to the melody, there\u2019s very little of that other than a simple repeated phrase. Yet I\u2019d agree - with the right singer, it is a great song. Performance can sometimes be all. Whether you like brass bands, country music, all and any form of classical music from string quartet to full orchestra, from soprano to choir, from jazz ensemble to big band, from rock to ballad, you will know when you hear something you like and for you, that will be good. I like some of all these genres. *Even if sung in a language you do not understand, like \u2018In Trutina\u2019 with words of ancient Latin. Pure magic. ",
