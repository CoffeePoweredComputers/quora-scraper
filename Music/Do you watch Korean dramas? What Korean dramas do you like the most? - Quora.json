            "answer_text": "A Korean Drama Addict here. I\u2019ve been addicted to Kdrama since 2014. I could go to lectures because I wanted to use the school WiFi to download a Kdrama, but not to listen to what the lecturer has. I can say it affected my academic life a bit, but I\u2019ve never regretted. I want to make something clear, You can\u2019t out-watch me when it comes to kdrama. I\u2019ve watched over 300. Amazingly, I don\u2019t delete them. So as we speak, about 80% of them are still on my PC. I\u2019ll give you my favorite Kdrama in the following Categories: Historical Korean DramasKorean Dramas about Foreign Invasion of KoreaModern, Action, Revenge Korean DramaCrime and Investigative KdramaBadass Korean Dramas (both action and non-action badass)Con Artists, Players, Scams, and Robinhood-like Korean DramasUpcoming Korean Dramas I\u2019m waiting forThese are just my favorite ones in each category. Historical Kdramas. I\u2019ve watched many historical Kdramas and there are 3 that catch my heart, at least for now: Jumong. (I\u2019ve watch this drama over and over, about 7 times now) This drama is about the founding of the Gogryeo Kingdom. It was my first kdrama, and since then, I\u2019ve never watched a historical drama that has the suspense, betrayal, life, lessons, and beauty of this drama. The continuation of this movie, which is Kingdom of the Winds, is equally good. 2. Emperor of the Sea (Sea god)  After my obsession with Jumong, and especially the main Character, Song Il Gook, I decided to search for more of his dramas, and then I chanced on this. It\u2019s another great historical drama that I\u2019ll always watch again. 3. Six Flying Dragons  Focusing on Lee Bang Won, the young prince, Six Flying Dragons tells the story of the foundation of the Joseon Dynasty in Korea and ambitions, success and conflicts of several real and fictional people. This is a piece that I love as well. Others historical dramas I can\u2019t forget: Lee SanEmpress KiGu Family BookDong YiShine or Go CrazyTree With Deep RootYou might be a great Kdrama addict as well, but if you\u2019ve not watched Jumong, I entreat you to go back to the drawing table. Think you\u2019ve watched more historical drama more than me? No, from the Scholar who walks the night to Jewel in the palace, historical dramas don\u2019t skip me. I\u2019ve not watched a few of them though. Foreign Invasion of Korean Dramas Koreans have nice dramas covering the time the country was invaded by Japan, especially. I\u2019m going to summarize these dramas before I list them. These dramas are about the foreign invasion of Korean and how a group of Koreans came together to fight for the freedom of their people. Those that caught my eye in this category: Bridal Mask 2. Mr. Sunshine  3. Inspiring Generation  4. Different Dreams (Still airing)  Others Foreign Invasion dramas I can\u2019t ignore: Chicago TypewriterFreedom Fighter Lee Hoe YoungCapital Scandal (2007)Modern, Action, and Revenge This category is about modern movies, revenge, and some action. It\u2019s a genre that I seem to have created myself, and I love watching dramas in this category. It\u2019s my second best genre after historical dramas. With this category, I\u2019ll love to hear more suggestion from other people about the best movies, because it\u2019s broad and there are many that I haven\u2019t watched. Also, I usually like those with a dose of action and plot. Some memorable ones in this category are: A Man Called God This drama is like City Hunter, but has action-packed and tech-prowess scenese than city hunter. And as I said earlier, I\u2019m obsessed with dramas where Song Il Gook is the main character. 2. City Hunter  3. Heartless City  4. Descendants of the sun  5. The K2  6. Iris 1& 2  7. Athena: Goddess of War  8. Healer  9. Kill It  10. Look Out  Others I can\u2019t ignore in this category Money FlowerTwo WeeksTime Between Dog and WolfThe Fugitive: Plan BMoorim SchoolGhostSignalTunnelMy Beautiful BrideAre You HumanCrime & Investigative - My Favorites Gap DongCriminal MindsMissing Noir MSpecial Affairs Team TenVoice 1, 2, & 3Children of a lesser godI hear your voiceI Remember you (Hello Monster)Cheo YongInvestigation CoupleRoom No. 9Children of NobodyThe Last EmpressGhost/PhantomHidden IdentityWantedBadass Kdramas that I love I\u2019ve not watched a lot of movies in this category, so anyone can suggest nice badass kdrama that\u2019s not here. I think the characters in these dramas were badass in some way or the other. Bad GuysBad Guys: City Of EvilThree DaysStrong Girl Boon SoonWhisper (non-action badass)Lawless Lawyer (one of my best)Stranger (non-action badass)Neighborhood HeroCon Artists, Player, Scams, Robinhood-like Kdrama. This category is about kdramas on scams and players. (no historical is added here). Some of my favorites in this category are: The Player38 Task ForceSwitch: Change the WorldLegend of the Blue Sea (part con artist, part supernatural)Upcoming Korean Dramas I\u2019m Waiting For Some of these korean dramas are still airing or about to finish, and with the trailers I\u2019ve watched, I think they\u2019ll be good: The Nokdu Flower -(Historical)Vagabond - thriller, action, crimeArthdal Chronicles (some characters from Descendants of the sun) - historicalSearch: WWW (I\u2019m waiting for this because the main lead for Kill It is also here.Aide -(political)If you\u2019re aware of any upcoming action or crime korean drama, i\u2019ll love to know. Thanks So, the reason is, you will not see a lot of romance in this list because I\u2019m not a die-hard fan of romance kdramas. However, I\u2019ve watched some that I\u2019m really proud of. Any other kdrama suggestion in the action, crime, love/romance (if the story is good), I would love to hear from all of you. Thanks. ",

            "answer_text": "I actually started watching K-drama\u2019s in the \u201890\u2019s when I lived in South Korea. I started watching them again about 8 years ago. The first one that I watched was called Foxy Lady and it set the pattern for how I watch many K-dramas - I don\u2019t finish them. Foxy Lady was my introduction to what, I assume, is the acting out of the fantasies of Korean women. First, education and careers are super important in South Korea. So, the lead characters in kd\u2019s are often under-educated and under-employed. Didn\u2019t go to college? Have a low-paying job? Don\u2019t worry, you can still marry a chaebol. (This didn\u2019t happen in Foxy Lady) Second, women are under a lot of pressure to make the right marriage. So, in the dramas they often make what I consider to be the wrong choice when it comes to choosing the man for them. In Foxy Lady the lead chose a man many years her junior over a doctor who loved her. And yes, I get the whole romance of the thing\u2026I guess I am just too pragmatic. However, I also hate when the lead chooses a man who is a total jerk over an awesome and nice man. This happened in Pretty Man and in Shining Inheritance, a kd that I highly recommend you *never* watch, and a lot of other dramas. Third, young men leave for two years to do mandatory military service. I assume this is really hard on relationships. So, to flip this harsh reality, the lead in kd\u2019s sometimes leaves for two years. And I hate this. I find it completely unnecessary. If I could remember the names of some of the Kd\u2019s this happened in, I\u2019d be ranting a bit more. It happened in Coffee Prince, where at least it basically made sense with the storyline. This leads me to another thing that I don\u2019t like about Kd\u2019s. Terrible endings! I know that I am being unrealistic. I mean, it would really be boring if every rom-com ended with the couple getting married. But that is what I want. I want to see them happy. I want to know that everything worked out well. I don\u2019t want to be left guessing like in Marry Him if You Dare. I just watched My Beautiful Gong Shim, and I might recommend it if it didn\u2019t end with a two year separation (reduced to 1) and a ridiculous \u201cI couldn\u2019t find a moment to call you the entire time I was in the US, but I still love you and let\u2019s get married.\u201d ARGH! But really, most kd\u2019s I don\u2019t even finish. I\u2019ve learned to push through the choosing the wrong guy thing - for the most part. (I will forever be crushed that the shy girl ended up with the FlowerBoy Next Door instead of the super-nice artist.) But the boredom often kills the show for me. So many shows get boring in the middle\u2026I have no idea if the boredom carries on through the end because I just give up. I was so looking forward to watching Big and Gong Yoo did a great job acting in it\u2026but the boredom killed me halfway through. (However, I must say that while Gong Yoo did a great job acting like a teenage boy\u2026he didn\u2019t act anything like the teenage boy he was supposed to be portraying.) Anyway, this was a long way to say that I am very picky and if I finished a drama it should be at least good enough to watch. Here are my recommendations: Coffee Prince - the second drama that I watched and the first that I finished. I absolutely love this drama and have re-watched it countless times. While it includes some of the things that I complained of above, it does not fit the mold of a typical k-drama. I cannot recommend it highly enough.Secret Garden - this one is also great. I recommend watching it without reading about it first, to preserve the surprise element.The History of the Salaryman - I never see this on other lists and that makes me sad. It isn\u2019t a rom-com. It is a comedy about an underdog. It just love it and, like Coffee Prince and Secret Garden, have watched it many times.Those are my top three and I recommend that everyone watch them. The following are K-dramas that I finished and like well enough to recommend: 4. My Love From the Stars* 5. Oh My Ghostess 6. Master\u2019s Sun 7. Cheese in the Trap* 8. Good Doctor 9. Pinocchio 10. Tomorrow\u2019s Cantabile\u2026maybe 11. Pasta 12. It\u2019s Okay, That\u2019s Love 13. Greatest Love* 14. Seoulmate* 15. A Gentleman\u2019s Dignity 16. 49 Days 17. Queen In-Hyun\u2019s Man/The Princess\u2019s Man* I starred the ones that I particularly like. ",

            "answer_text": "A biiiigg YES! I love watching Korean dramas. I enjoy watching all types of Kdramas. And the best part is that most of the kdramas have a tint of various genres in it making them all the more lovable. So here are my top 5 kdramas. Strong girl do bong soon- Well this is my all time favorite drama. It's a story about a \"SUPERPOWER GIRL \u2764\ufe0f\" who has magic in her genes. It has the perfect blend of comedy, romance, drama, action, fiction as well as thrill. The star cast is amazing & with leads as Park Bo-Young, Park Hyung-sik & Ji soo. The witty character & flawless acting of Bong soon (Park bo-young) will keep you hooked while Park Hyung-sik is definitely a sight to sore eyes\ud83d\ude0d. It has got an amazing story line as well. So you will definitely not be disappointed.. 2.Descendants of the sun: This story revolves around the struggles faced by a doctor ( Song hye-kyo) & soldier( Song Joong-ki) who are not able to be together due to their busy jobs & different ideals. However destiny (here the script writer \ud83d\ude09) has its own ways & means to bring 2 lovers together. It is mostly a love story but does have a lot of action comedy & drama. The story, second leads, supporting cast, OST have also done an excellent job in keeping the audience engaged. Caution: You might fall in love with either Doctor Kang (Song hye-kyo) or Yoo Si Jin( Song Joong-ki) so please put a seat belt on your hearts\ud83d\ude09  3.Weight lifting fairy Kim Bok-Joo: This overall looks like an average romantic comedy drama however deals with a number of sensitive topics in the most light hearted way that we never talk about. Like remember the first heartbreak your friends told you was not worth crying over but you still did, or about the craziest things you did just to have a glimpse of that one person ( who was never yours to begin with), how sometimes your loved ones genuine concern seems to bother you the most, the joy of just having friends & family, the fear of losing it all, being left out. It's all in here. It's a heart warming drama that will leave you smiling.  4.Doctors: This is that one rare drama that made me cry in almost every single episode. It is one top notch medical drama with great scenes of surgeries & operations. Had I seen this before my 10th I would have surely joined a medical college\ud83d\ude1b. The plot portrays the story of a rebellious teen Hye Jeong who mends her ways of living when shown love & affection by her grandma & teacher. This is one drama layered with multiple stories nicely woven into it. It is nicely packed with a bad ass heroine, warm corny hero \ud83d\ude0d, vicious villain & adorable second leads. It is an emotional medical drama with elements of comedy & romance.  5.Suspicious Partner: As the name suggests the female lead is a suspect of a high profile murder case.( It's not a spoiler). It is a very underrated drama but has an amazing plot that involves murder, mystery, crime,suspense, romance, comedy,heartbreak..... You can find it aaaalllll in this. It is filled with a number of twists & turn that will keep you hooked throughout the drama.  ",

            "answer_text": "I would be happy to! Allow me to offer up my Top 5 All-time favorite Korean Dramas. About two years ago I accidentally stumbled upon my first Korean series while struggling with a bout of depression (literally unable to get get out of bed). I\u2019m not sure exactly what it is that made this particular show such a hit for me, especially considering how critical I can get about film (huge movie buff). But I digress. I can only stress that the titles not be a source of judgement when reading this as the translations likely play a huge role in how corny they can sound:  Title: Playful Kiss (Mischievous Kiss) Year: 2015 Seasons (#): 1 Episodes (#): 16 Episode Length: 60 min Plot: This Dramedy tells a tale of the slow-bubbling romance between a sunny student and her popular classmate.  TV Series Trailer (YouTube) | Season 1 Apart from how unbelievably beautiful Ha Ni (Jung So Min) is, the dynamic between herself and classmate Seung Jo (Kim Hyun Joong) was perfect. Nothing can be cause for ruining the potential of a show then when the leads can\u2019t quite click together. But that is not the case here. The episodes are just over an hour long which makes one season more than enough to satisfy any binge watching junkies out there. As of today, the show is still available via the streaming giants so be sure to check it out. There is one final thing to be mentioned regarding this show\u2026 and that is not to be deterred by the various remakes that are out there. Japan and Taiwan among others have had success with their own takes on the book, but none of them compare to the Korean version in my opinion. This particular series will always be the absolute #1 favorite to me.  This next one came in as a close #2 for me was this next one which interestingly has been the ONLY series I\u2019ve revisited in order to watch all the way through once more. The leads had great chemistry, Title: My Love From the Star Year: 2013 Seasons (#): 3 Episodes (#): 21 Episode Length: 60 min Plot: Do Min-Joon is an alien who landed on Earth 400 years ago during the Joseon Dynasty period. He possesses a near perfect appearance and enhanced physical abilities involving his vision, hearing and speed. Do Min-Joon has held a cynical view regarding human beings\u2026 until he falls for actress Cheon Song-Yi.  TV Series Trailer (YouTube) | Season 1 - Episode 1 Jeon Ji Hyeon made this one what it was in my opinion. There is a particular scene which remains with me to this day. It was just a brief 10 second part where she mocks the American language and apologizes for whatever reason by saying \u201cSorrry\u201d as she breaks out of Korean for just a moment. She completely pulls off the hugely popular actress/idol role and manages to be quite hilarious throughout.  This next one came in as a close #2 for me was this next one which interestingly has been the ONLY series I\u2019ve revisited in order to watch all the way through once more. The leads had great chemistry, Title: Good Doctor Year: 2013 Seasons (#): 2 Episodes (#): 20 Episode Length: 60 min Plot: A young man named Park Shi-On (Joo Won) has Savant Syndrome which manifests through developmental issues. As an adult, Park attains a highly acclaimed Surgeon residency. Dr. Shi-On struggles to communicate effectively despite being one of the hottest prospects for his amazing ability to diagnose pediatric patients in a far more accurate and timely manner than any of his superiors are accustomed to.  TV Series Trailer (YouTube) | Season 1 The performance given by Joo Won as a mentally disabled person is all the reason you should need to watch this one. I am telling you this is one you should not pass up. It didn\u2019t hurt that the show picks up fairly quickly as you find yourself hooked just after viewing the first 20 minutes of episode 1.  OK I know that this was supposed to be my \u201cTop 3\u2033 but I simply could not leave you without being made aware of just one last show. Probably the most drama-oriented of the bunch, and also the series on my list with the strongest chemistry between leads. And yes, it\u2019s another doctor show. But also well worth a watch. Title: Emergency Couple Year: 2014 Seasons (#): 3 Episodes (#): 21 Episode Length: 60 min Plot: It would be best to just trust me with this one, as the plot for Emergency Couple is probably the most dynamic of all my choices. Just know that it follows Jin-Hee (Song Ji-Hyo) and Chang-Min (Choi Jin-Hyuk), recently divorced and unknowingly about to cross paths once again.  TV Series Trailer (YouTube) | Season 1 \u2014 Episode 1 I will reiterate how this is one you really just need to watch and appreciate. The viewing experience will be at its finest if you go in for the most part unaware of the plot. The performances by Song Ji-Hyo and Choi Jin-Hyuk were probably #2 if I had to rank this list in such a way. I had seen Choi in a previous show called Gu Family Book (which also might be worth a look) where he essentially played a villain-type role that was rather impressive.  Last but not least is this little gem. Title: It\u2019s OK, That\u2019s Love Year: 2014 Seasons (#): 2 Episodes (#): 16 Episode Length: 60 min Plot: Jang Jae-Yeol (Jo In Sung) is a best-selling author who accidentallly falls for Ji Hae-Soo (Kong Hyo-Jin), a Clinical Psychiatrist. The only problem is that Ji Hae doesn\u2019t want to start dating him!  TV Series Trailer (YouTube) | Season 1 This one has it all. A solid plot with plenty of mystery, great chemistry between the leads and even a few twists throughout. Slightly off topic, but I could not and still cannot get over how attractive Kong Hyo-Jin is. I\u2019d give anything for a chance to take her out. A beautiful, strong minded woman possessing enormous acting talent. This one also probably had the strongest supporting cast with my favorite secondary performance of all time by Lee Gwang Soo as Park Soo Gwang. His role on this show was undoubtably a breakout performance that has led to an entirely original new series currently being made for him to play the lead on. The soundtrack for this one is also particularly noteworthy, as I\u2019ve added much of it onto my phone since. ",

            "answer_text": "The Best Korean Drama Series I've watched so far would be: Boys Over Flowers (a Korean remake of Boys Before lowers Japanese drama) Plot: A poor girl named Geum Jan Di saves a boy who was about to fall of the roof of a mega school named Shinhwa High. When she saves him, she was given the honor to attend the rich school. Than there\u2019s Gu Jun Pyo who is the legitimate owner of that school and everything his father owns and names Shinhwa. He unexpectedly falls in love with Geum Jan Di as she is not like every other girls. Also Gu Jun Pyo has elite friends who are rich as well, combined together they are called \u201cFlower four\u201d as they are all four really good looking boys. This drama will always be my favorite forever. Perfect drama to watch. Has comedy, romance, thriller, action and many other moments. 2) Heirs  Plot: A rich guy called Kim Tan who\u2019s mother is a mistress lives in America since he was little by his Step brother Kim Won. Kim tan fell in love with Cha Eun Sang the first time he met her in America. The girl Cha Eun Sang went to America to find her older sister who hasn\u2019t been contacting her and her mother since she was there. The girl was the sole reason why Kim Tan came back to Korea. This drama is worth it because you get to see Lee Min Ho\u2019s incredible acting and cuteness. Lee Min Ho also sang one of the OST songs in this drama. 3) Fated to love you  Plot: An ordinary soft woman named Jang Na-Ra accidentally drank a beer like bottle which unknowingly contains a strong medicine for making a person lose consciousness and to get pregnant easily. Without knowing it, she accidentally goes to a different hotel room which the main guy named Jang Hyuk is sleeping. Jang Hyuk who was already drowsy from getting drunk due to his broken heart, his girlfriend caused him, they both slept together. Next morning they knew what they did unconsciously and decided to part ways but as fate would have it they met again and in a different circumstance this time. The girl is pregnant with Jang Hyuk\u2019s child. Jang Hyuk is the owner of a large company. This drama is worth watching, it has the most hilarious moments, as well as really sad moments which you\u2019ll 100% cry. It also has the most cute, lovable moments in which you\u2019ll just want to ship them. 4) My Lovely Girl  Plot: Lee Hyun-wook (Rain) is the CEO of a talent agency that scouts and trains idols. He is a brilliant composer-producer who appears cold and indifferent on the outside but is sensitive and kind-hearted. Hyun-wook lives in great difficulty as he is unable to let go of his ex-girlfriend who died in an accident he witnessed first hand 3 years previously. His ex-girlfriend's sister, Yoon Se-na (Krystal), moves to Seoul in order to pursue her music-composing career and meets Hyun-wook who helps her achieve it. Hyun-wook replaces his father (Park Yeong-gyu) as the president of ANA Entertainment, bringing him challenges and conflicts in his career as a president, with trainees, company promotions, his love life and Se-na. In the midst of healing each other through music, they fall in love. I personally love this drama because Krystal is in it. She doesn\u2019t come in a lot of drama\u2019s but when she does i\u2019m there to watch it. 5) She was pretty  Plot:When Ji Sung Joon was young he was fat and ugly while the girl Kim Hye Jin was pretty on the inside and out, they were both friends in their young days but then Ji Sung Joon had to leave for America and Hye Jin was left behind to remember her good friend. Then years passed they grew into adults, Park Seo Joon became a diligent director and also became fit and handsome while Hye Jin was the complete opposite. This drama is so good. Amazing plot. Those are my top 5 dramas I've watched and would recommend.Happy Watching!!",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s focus with some of the best kdramas of the recent decade. I\u2019m quite picky when it comes to watching KDramas, so it\u2019s indeed something when it merits my praise.  6. The Producers (2015) This is a first of its kind in the Korean drama genres. It features the lives of producer-directors in the Korean entertainment industry, particularly in the variety department. This story focuses on the life of Baek Seung Chan (Kim Soo Hyun), a rookie PD who enters the world of variety shows. This drama also topbills Gong Hyo Jin (from The Master\u2019s Sun), IU (from Dream High), and Cha Tae Hyun (from My Sassy Girl). This is very sure to give you a good laugh. Nonetheless, it has a well developed plot which is well distributed throughout the story.  Plus, you get to see a very cute competitive Baek Seung Chan in this story!  5. The Innocent Man (2012) A guy who was once willingly devoted to do anything for his loved one got the taste of betrayal in the worst way possible after serving years in jail for the crime he took instead of her. He then sets off for his round of revenge. Okay, this one really had me like WTF every end of the episode, because this was no ordinary Cinderella story. The revenge plots are deep, and though the plot devices are too much of a clich\u00e9, it kind of worked here. The twists are also shockingly good! For the record, there was no other villain in any korean drama I have watched that I hated more than her (Han Jae Hee played by Park Si Yeon)  It actually means she acted so well the viewers probably hated her so much during those times this show was aired. As the story unfolds, you get to understand her though, that you begin to doubt yourself whether you should really not hate her, or you should just hate her even more. This series stars Song Joong Ki, Park Si Yeon, and Moon Chae Won.  4. Healer (2014\u20132015) Healer, an infamous night courier, comes across a request from a client searching for this \u201cchild\u201d. It turns out that this child, the client, and Healer himself share a common past. For a korean drama series, this is heaping with loads of action and romance! Every episode will take you to the edge of your seat with the twists and developments. The musical score is just too perfect, too!  Another thing to look forward to is the chemistry between Ji Chang Wook and Park Min Young, the two lead stars of this series. This will leave every fangirl speechless and breathless after.  3. Remember: War of the Son (2015\u20132016) Seo Jin Woo, a high school student, suffers from an ultra rare mental condition called hyperthymesia, which allows him to vividly remember anything from his past to the smallest detail. His father, then suffering from amnesia, was framed of murder, which compels him to study law and become an attorney to clear his father\u2019s name. This drama has a lot of feels. You really would feel sorry for the lead (Yoo Seung Ho as Seo Jin Woo) given the circumstances and the obstacles that prevent him from getting justice. It kind of depicts the kind of corrupt society that we do not wish to happen in our lives. Sure, by his looks alone, a massive fanbase must have grown for this series.  But wouldn\u2019t you feel sorry for him if he passionately cries like this?  This drama also stars Park Min Young. Warning: Don\u2019t get too indulged you might regret feeling the Last Episode Separation Syndrome.  2. Descendants of the Sun (2016) A doctor and a soldier perform duties that are very opposite with each other. Will this obstacle stop them from growing in love with each other, amidst a disaster that draws them closer? I was very skeptical to watch this at first, but as soon as I hopped in, the ride was just awesome. True, the plot wasn\u2019t really a superhuman fictional type, but it was something that captured the audience\u2019s attention. Why so? Because it was something that was amazing. One that takes life for a nationalistic reason, and another that values life above everything else. The dilemma worked effectively. It was also one of those frw dramas that did not require the clich\u00e9d tird party characters. This drama also showcases some of the best action stunts! Topbilled by Song Joong Ki And Song Hye Kyo, along with Jin Goo and Kim Ji Won, this 2016 hit is definitely worth a try!  1. You Who Came from the Stars This is definitely my number 1. A haughty toplist actress Cheon Song Yi (Jun Ji Hyun) meets and falls in love with an alien (Kim Soo Hyun) who has been on Earth for the past 400 years.  Jun Ji Hyun slays it. She is the romcom goddess! There was never an episode where she failed to make me laugh! Aside from the romance (which was aso too awesome to handle), the comedy was just phenomenal for a kdrama. Not to mention that Kim Soo Hyun\u2019s acting was very commendable in this drama. The plot was very ell presentedtoo! I couldn\u2019t ask for more in this drama. Well, I haven\u2019t really watched a lot of Kdramas, but in my opinion, of all those that I\u2019ve watched, these are the best. Edit: Okay, so let me just add some recent dramas I have watched, since I have made this answer prior to watching those.  W: Two Worlds (2016) Imagine falling in love with someone you literally can\u2019t reach\u2026 i.e. a fictional character. Well, bookworms and otakus can relate so well to that. But what if the tables turn and it goes the other way around? Now, it\u2019s the fictional character falling in love with the realmone. Jus how coll and exciting is that? You wouldn\u2019t get enough with this extraordinary love story with a mysterious twist! Who wouldn\u2019t love that?  Topbilled by Hallyu king Lee Jong Suk and Dong Yi herself Han Hyo Joo, this is not your ordinary comic kdrama, nor is it another \u201cmanga-turned-drama\u201d story (I\u2019m sorry for the pun, for those who understand). Any kdrama fanatic would say its plot is one-of-a-kind; being fast paced, not too overly dramatic, but can still be very effective at catching people\u2019s hearts at crucial plot points. It is also way effective in making the viewers engage at the tip of their seats without making them bored. The twists are jaw dropping, \u2018nuff said. I really wouldn\u2019t want to say more as spoiling the tiniest bit of the story would really change the way you would see the story.  Lately, the lineup of kdramas has been so phenomenal it is so hard to choose what to watch. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I do watch Korean dramas and I just love it. I started watching it during my college years and it still continues. I would say, it is the best healer. I watch some of it repeatedly and it has never failed to soothe my soul. I loved some dramas to the core. I have watched many English series too but Korean dramas have always been my priority. Let me rank them according to my liking! 1. Gentlemen\u2019s Dignity - I went through some of the answers to this question but I don\u2019t understand why nobody mentioned this. This is the best drama I have ever seen. It is the story about four friends who are in their 40\u2019s still trying to grow up. They are all so childish in their behavior which is so adorable. Jang Dong-Gun has nailed it. Music was the best. It is so addictive. 2. My girlfriend is a Gumiho - This is a fantasy series. A Nine-tailed fox which was trapped in a painting is been released by the hero and she follows him everywhere. Since she is so naive, the hero helps her. Later they fall in love with each other. Shin Min-ah is the best cast and I don\u2019t think anyone can replace her. 3. Strong women Do Bong Soon - This one is a fantasy series and one of the best. The female lead is blessed with strongness. But the power is also cursed that she can use it only for doing good to people. If she uses it against innocent, then she will lose the power. I loved the way the hero gets all shy when she flirts with him. I also loved a character Oh Dong-Byung who is a transgender who loves the hero. The scenes were hilarious. I would list the other series which I liked. 4. Master's Sun 5. You are beautiful 6. Secret Garden 7. Boys over Flowers 8. To the Beautiful you 9. Playful Kisses 10. 49 days 11. Oh my ghost 12. My princess 13. My love from another star There are some series which I liked but i totally forgot their name. ",

            "answer_text": "I suggest: If We Were A Season This is one of my faves of all time! And I would never get tired of watching it again and again. They were childhood friends and secretly admired each other. But they stopped being friends for a while. Until an incident came, linking them back together.They never admitted their feelings to each other. Yes, it does seem clich\u00e9 at first but as you dig deeper and watch, you\u2019ll feel anger, emptiness, and sadness for the two. It\u2019s bittersweet! The ending will make you whimper in tears. Just come back and thank me when you\u2019re done ;) I\u2019ll give you a hint of the story: [Hye rim dislikes movies that end with a kiss. Because it seems like it\u2019s already their ending. She prefers hugs because it means there\u2019s more to come. And it isn\u2019t really the end.]  2. Good Doctor  Man, this-This was really- >.< (ugh. I can\u2019t even explain the pain I felt!)It had me crying for hours! Shion is an autistic savant who became a pediatrician and tries to prove himself in the face of conflict with patients and peers. A lot of people underestimated him because of his condition when he was a total genius. Good Doctor is a very heartwarming drama that highlights one man's road to achieve his dream. I never thought that I would be drawn to this drama. I felt like I didn\u2019t want to watch it because it was of medical. But as I\u2019ve stayed and understood the situation, every episode left deeper scars and pain. 3. A Werewolf Boy  I never thought I would love this as well! To be honest, I am NOT a fan of werewolf stories and films. I ran out of kdramas to watch and stumbled on this and thought maybe I could give it a try. At first, I was like, okay, yeah, so what, then? yep, he\u2019s half-werewolf, what\u2019s new? But as soon as it ends it totally left me-(ya know already!)  4. Clean With Passion For Now  There\u2019s this CEO who\u2019s germophobic. Even the littlest speck of dust would make him faint if he sees it. And there\u2019s also this girl who\u2019s very messy and always untidy. She\u2019s desperate for work but none accepts her. She had no choice but to work for a cleaning service - which was owned by that germophobic guy. Her father worked for a cleaning company also but was stopped FOR A REASON (find it out yourself). So, Oh-sol had to keep it a secret to her father. But an unexpected romance blooms and- (I don\u2019t wanna spoilll haha). If you liked this kind of drama well, you have to watch the next one! (number 5) 5. I Am Not A Robot I love this drama a lot! It\u2019s all in one! The chemistry\u2019s there, the music, their dialogues, the plot... It was in fact, AMAZING!  In which, a girl named Jia had an affair with an inventor but they split up due to- (Nah. Find that yourself also). This inventor made up a human-robot that looks a lot like Jia, named, Aji 3. Jia becomes entangled in a strange love triangle after pretending to be a robot that looks exactly like her to a person who has an allergy to human contact. But\u2026 what will happen if Mingyu finds out that he\u2019s been with a real person the whole time? The robot that he patted with his bare hands? The robot that he held? The robot that made him feel crazy because he thinks he\u2019s in love with that stupid robot? WATCH TO FIND OUT MORE :)))  If you\u2019re finding for a kdrama that has it all like this one, ya better watch the next one too! (number 6) 6. Goblin Of course, this one is also my favorite.This drama made me feel all sorts of emotions! Although some doesn\u2019t like it since it\u2019s about powers and non-existent things.. But if you\u2019re like me then you would totally love this! ALL. IN. ONE.  Goblin is a fantasy romance about a modern-day goblin who seeks to end his cursed immortal life and needs a human bride to do so. His life then becomes intertwined with a grim reaper who is unable to remember his past. But when the goblin finally finds his bride, he suddenly realizes he wants to live and be with her. Goblin is an epic tale with a story that spans centuries. It was quite an interesting ride filled with some amazing characters, talented actors, and a fresh and unique story woven beautifully throughout each episode. Visually, Goblin is absolutely stunning. And so much detail went into setting up the shots and individual scenes. It was all done very artistically. The drama also filmed several scenes in Canada that featured some breathtaking scenery.  The thing I love about this is, apart from the romantic scenes that literally hit me, it has a lot of funny and thrilling scenes! Like I\u2019ve said: ALL IN ONE!It will make you smile, laugh, cry, annoyed, then suddenly, you\u2019ll just feel chills around your body. 6. Strong Woman Do Bong-SoonThe picture tells it all! Well not really all.. there\u2019s so much to discover and for you, to unfold. This is also one of my faves <3 WHO WOULD\u2019VE THOUGHT A GIRL THIS SMALL COULD CARRY A\u2014    Do Bong-Soon was born with superhuman strength\u2014a gift that\u2019s passed down to all the women in her family tree. Her dream is to create a video game with her as the main character, which is why she is ecstatic about landing a job as the CEO\u2019s bodyguard at Ainsoft, a popular gaming company. CEO Ahn Min-Hyuk has been receiving anonymous threats because he\u2019s next in line to take over his father\u2019s other company. Meanwhile, there has been a series of kidnappings in Bong-Soon\u2019s neighborhood. One of the lead investigators is Bong-Soon\u2019s childhood friend, Guk-Doo who she is secretly in love with. Eventually, all three join forces to solve these crimes, and their relationships shift. VOTE FOR MORE KDRAMA SUGGESTIONS! I STILL HAVE A LOT IN MIND! ",

            "answer_text": "\u2079(It's gonna be super long since I want to pretend like I am a professional writer XD so bear with me, please. If you don't want to read either the description or spoilers (I might slip accidentally) you can simply scroll to see the pictures ^_^) I'll be listing 15-20 dramas which I love the most. I can't shorten the list more as the mentioned ones have touched my heart in a different way and I can never forget the story and characters. They aren't in particular order. \u2606 Chicago Typewriter:-  The story is about a famous writer who receives an old typewriter and his fan girl who actually became his anti-fan because of his stuck up, ungrateful attitude. It involves an interesting character, the ghost who acts like a ghost writer because male lead is suffering from writer's block. The only twist, the story of freedom fighters he wrote is real and he and both the main couple are related to each other in their past lives. I initially didn't see the drama because I thought it's a period drama that will become super dark and ignored it for a year. My bad. The ghost and the male lead has this whole new level of bromance where ghost always pull tricks on him. The relationship between male and female lead is sweet and bitter but they manage to work it out while understanding and healing each other. I also liked how they even showed the troubles those freedom fighters, specially the main characters go through with no guarantee of making it out alive. Those feelings still hit me hard. Also, this drama is the one who made the OSTs playing in the background more powerful. Cinematography and aesthetics were perfect.  \u2606 Hotel Del Luna:-  It's a horror based rom-com drama filled with fantasy stuffs everywhere. The story is about a woman who is the CEO of a hotel \u2018Del Luna\u2019 who serves dead people before they head to the afterlife. She's stuck in our realm but this changes when she appoints a human manager. I have a special thing for reincarnation or previous life stories, I guess. Yes, our female lead is also stuck in the past because she had been betrayed but it's the human manager who eases her guilt and pain and she finally goes to afterlife. Though what I like about this is not only the leads but also the relationship and bonding between the main and supporting characters. Everyone has a story and everyone contributes to the story. They also solve the grudges of dead souls so every episode deals with their tear jerking stories as well. Everything is eye-pleasing here from aesthetics to costumes to OSTs which fits well the situation the characters face and will make you cry. It really feels like a fantasy story though it's not jump scare kind of horror. The drama discusses the death in a bit lighter way but it's worth a shot. I did dropped this one in middle before picking up again and I am glad I did.  \u2606 Sky Castle:-  Where to start with this drama? This is one of the best dramas out there which falls in satire, dark comedy genre. This is about four elite families living in high class society called \u2018Sky Castle'. It shows what great length parents go through to get their kids get admitted to one of the top universities, from hiring tutors illegally to pressuring their own kids and ignoring their mental health and controlling them. This drama also shows the pain of the kids who go through the cut throat competition of academics, with their will power, dreams, teenage years being crushed upon by their parents expectations. I like the premise so much. Despite not going through this myself but as an Indian, I know this leads to mental issues and suicide among school kids and college students. The plot is tightly written that kept me on edge every time because I was so worried about the kids and felt so bad for them. The OSTs only added more fear in my mind (whenever it played, I knew something's bad gonna happen) as I watched the story took sharp, mind numbing turns. What I also liked on the drama is, it also shows the side of adults and their perception too and give their characters the chance to redeem. Overall, I would say, I never was bored in it for a second and every character is memorable.  \u2606 Mystic Pop-up bar:-  This short 12 episode drama has been recently aired in May-June 2020 and falls under fantasy drama with reincarnation and death theme (I know my choice in drama isn't that diverse). The elements are similar to Hotel Del Luna with the female lead trying to resolve the grudges but in this, she does it for living people by going in their dreams. She is stuck on earth for 500 years and has to complete the deadline of resolving 100 thousand people in a month. She with her partner who is an officer of after life police teams up with a guy who has psychic powers to complete her target. It is very light-hearted, funny drama and it actually shows the after life world a lot more times, in a very creative way The trio is very interesting to watch as they do hilarious things during their grudge solving missions. They all have a very warm and amazing dynamic and I kept watching it just for them. The writing is sleek and story moves smoothly with all the dots of the puzzle connected well. Though the story was predictable, I had fun watching it and even though the drama is not anything extraordinary but I'll watch it again for characters, acting, story and comedy.  \u2606 Circle:-  Circle is the first true sci-fi drama produced in Korea (they do make sci-fi dramas but this drama takes the whole cake for being the true one). This 12 episode drama is actually divided into two parts i.e. it shows two different stories. First part is of 2017 which follows a college student who investigates the mysterious death in his campus while the second part is about a detective in 2037 who goes to \u2018Smart Earth' (a crime-free city made separately for people who can afford living there) to investigate kidnapping case. What I like about this is, it's totally unpredict9able. It's filled with alien technology, advanced human technology, hi-tech gadgets, illegal experiments, murders, mystery and an alien too. This drama uses the \u2018Human Memory' as the center of the drama and shows how our memory makes us the individuals we are and how we are nothing without it. It explores the idea of \u2018No memory, No emotions, No pain' very well. One other thing that kept me hooked and made it memorable are the characters themselves. They made me laugh and cry for them, especially the longing and yearning of brothers was too much for me to handle. It was a perfect drama for me however it ends with an open ending so I low key wish a sequel. ;)  \u2606 Signal:-  Signal is a story about a criminal profiler from Cold case department in 2017 who finds an old walkie talkie which connects him to another detective from the past i.e. 1997. Using this, both of them try to solve the case they have in their hands and this changing the past and present. This drama is one of the best dramas in kdrama history written so smartly and uses the time travel theme efficiently without a single loophole in the plot. I was never bored, not at all. Every case they solve teaches the characters something while they deal with their own personal life regrets and internal conflicts. I was amazed every time new twist used to come in the story. The big expected twist was, they were connected from the past but in a very interesting way. Obviously it doesn't have the romance plot too (well, there's a bit of it but it never came true so\u2026) but it's not the problem here. You won't even notice that. You will only notice the acting which is first class and would cry for them as they go through the pain themselves. I did and I cried for the dead big brother of 2017 detective for whom he became the detective (to prove his innocence).  \u2606 Prison Playbook:-  Prison Playbook is a story about a star baseball player who gets convicted after he assaults a guy, who tries to rape his sister, ends up in coma (I know, the laws of Korea seems to be messed up in these kdramas). He goes to prison for a year and the drama follows him and shows how his life changes as he meets different people with different backgrounds and different personalities. It is a bit lengthy (20 episodes, each episode is 1.5 hours) but it didn't stop me to kept watching it because this drama showed me, it's not necessary to have jaw-dropping turns in the story to watch a drama and make it successful. It might be a bit odd to hear I saw prisoners doing mundane, everyday things in the entire drama but it's the main charm of the drama. The beauty of this drama lies in the characters themselves. Every character is freshly engraved in my memory. All have their own back story and it showed their struggles, how they fail and how they overcome after trying again and again in their life. Like normal human beings. I lived their lives with them. The OSTs just add extra charm to it (I don't hear many OSTs but I ended up downloading this drama's because it made me do so).  \u2606 Angry Mom:-  Angry Mom is another family based funny drama that I love and I end up watching it's short clips again and again. This drama is about a mom who was a rule breaker and used to get into street fights when she was 18. Now when she saw her own child getting bullied and being beaten up in school, she goes to her school posing as a high schooler as authorities doesn't take actions. This one shows and tackles the serious issues like bullying, delinquent students, school corruption by mixing it with comedy. It might seem weird to many but to me, it is the only relief and I was willing to watch it. Mom would go around with her bold and fearless attitude and tries to find evidences to get her daughter justice. It not only ensured unexpected hilarious events and situations but also make other students to not create more problems and change for the better. Though, at the end, I didn't get to see the romance (it was one sided but for the first time, I regretted to not have any), it was worth my time as I laughed so much all the time and became the part of the mom and daughter's journey. Though it also shows how corruption is deeply rooted in the schools and how they might prioritize reputation of the institution above student's life and might be busy laundering money for own personal gain.  \u2606 Are you human too?:-  Are you human too? is a romantic-comedy drama with a robot theme. The story is about a rich 3rd generation chaebol who gets into accident while on his search for her mother and falls into coma. Her mother, who is a scientist, replaces him with her own developed human like robot whose design is based on her son so that he could protect her son's place in his grandfather's company. I love this drama to bits and have already watched it 3 times (I don't repeat a drama once I finish it. There are only 3 dramas I re-watched again.). I have seen people who can't watch it because of the love story between a human and a non-human and I understand it all too well. It's almost impossible but then love has different definitions for everyone and there are different kind of love. I find it beautiful because it is not bound to body attraction and the love and care female lead show for the male lead have a unique effect on his ever upgrading artificial intelligence. I felt so proud to watch a smart robot, who doesn't know a thing about cruelty of humans and their complex nature, learns and develop on his own and changes everyone's lives around him at the end of the drama. The story is simple but the characters make it special and breathe life to the drama. The acting is simply superb (specially the male lead who switches from jerk human to kind robot in an instant), the cinematography is beautiful, story flows beautifully and OSTs are a blessing.  \u2606 The Cursed:-  The Cursed is a horror, supernatural mystery thriller which tells the story about the reporter who is trying to dig deep into an IT company for its suspicious activities. During this, she met a high school kid who can cast curse (basically kill the person) through her supernatural powers. She offers to help her as both of them find the CEO of the same IT company being involved in murders and shamanism. I love this. It is spooky not enough to haunt me in night (I can't watch horror movies at all but I can't tel for others). It's not that unpredictable but what I really liked about it is, how fast paced and smartly written this drama was. I don't think there are many horror dramas which has evil spirits trying to kill the entire country while trying to spread throughout the world. The entire plot surrounds this single purpose and I got to see the real fight between evil spirit and the curse caster. The cast is simply superb and the atmosphere throughout the drama gives off the dark, serious, doomed atmosphere.  \u2606 Your honor:-  Your honor is a comedy, court room drama with a simple romantic plot at the side. It is about two twin brothers, one is a judge and the other is a petty criminal. The judge got kidnapped one day and his brother replaces him under strange circumstances and becomes the judge. This drama is a full package of romance, mystery thriller, court room drama, bad relationship with brother and less caring mother and cool OSTs. I love how this drama showed the role of a judge I never ever thought about. How he is important and how he holds the power to either save or destroy the victim's family. It deals with good cases, though not every case gets justice (of course the criminal male lead is here for money too in the start) as the male lead changes from greedy to considerate. The female lead plays a big role in his change as a good, supporting trainee under him and I love her for that. She isn't over the top and is sweet and understanding equally. This drama also has its own hilarious moments and the male lead (Yoo Shi Yoon) just nails the dual role.  \u2606 Life on Mars:-  The story is about a forensic expert who trusts evidences and the data he collects over anything else. When the girl he likes goes missing after he accidentally releases him, he meets with the accident during his search and ends up in the past as a detective. Now, he tries to get back to the present while solving the cases that he and his new team faces everyday. Honestly, this drama is slow and has a depressing and serious kind of tone throughout the story. You might not be interested in this story at first. But that's where you're gonna miss it. I liked how detailed everyday life of the past was shown. Everyone acted so well, especially Jung Kyung Ho and Park Sung Woong clearly portrayed the characters well. I could feel the tension of the detective and can feeling of urgency and \u2018everything is at stake\u2019 kept swirling in my brain. The bonding was strong and family-like, I would cry if anything happens to anyone of them. The ending morale of the case they come up with forces you to think out of the box. This drama blurs the line of reality and imagination and forces you to draw your own conclusion of what's right and what's wrong at the end.  \u2606 Moments at 18:-  This slice of life drama is one of the sweetest thing you would ever come across. This drama is about a new transfer student Joon Woo who meets with the girl Soobin on his first day to school. He is a quiet kid who appears like he doesn't care about anyone and lives like there's no tomorrow but he is just a normal kid who earns his own keep and has a troubled family and life. Slowly, he opens up with Soobin, who is understanding and caring and gives him a chance despite what others say. As they fall in love, we see all ups and down of what a normal 18 year old faces in his or her life. I love the character of Joon Woo and Soobin, actually I love all the characters, whether they are good or bad. It's a well-written drama with simple storyline. It has no extra drama or cliche scenes but it feels real. Though I couldn't relate to the life these kids had (I have no life), I still loved how simple, sweet and realistic it looked. The bullying, discrimination and struggles Joon Woo faces as he runs multiple part time jobs, I learned to thank what I already have. Even though Soobin has everything, she knew how to be grateful and considerate. She knew how to stand for right and wrong without being arrogant and I learned this from her. You can even learn something from Hwi-Young, the negative character of the drama who is actually the result of bad parenting, who at the end learns bullying is wrong and it's okay to loose and not come first. I am sure you'll gonna fall in love with everyone on board.  \u2606 Crash Landing on You:-  Crash Landing on You is a story about a businesswoman who while paragliding get stuck in the storm and unfortunately ends up landing in North Korea. There, she is found out by a North Korean soldier. He along with his team helps her to hide and takes the charge to take her safely to South Korea. It's a romantic comedy and honestly, I am glad I watched it. It has everything from beautiful shots to costumes. The actors potrayed their roles amazingly with Hyun Bin stealing the show with his gentleman and kind behaviour and Ye Jin potraying the lady who is strong, independent, street smart and equally compassionate and kind. It was amazing to see them grow together and understand each other world by literally living in it. The team and its members had this strong bond and were like a family to each other and they helped our leading couple equally. I also loved the second lead couple (and I guess everyone who watched it loved them as well). Every other side characters were written well and had their own story to tell. I was never bored. The lives of North korean might not be potrayed accurately but it was still quite real. It was interesting to see villages to the politics that goes in there. OSTs once again, was beautiful.  \u2606 High School, Love on!:-  The story is about an death angel Seulbi, who after accidentally saving a human 18 year old student Woohyun, ends up becoming a human herself. She ends up living with Woohyun, as his grandmother accepts her into the family because she doesn't remember anything and saved his grandson's life. Now, despite it's flaws (by others, I don't see flaws because I enjoy it more), I really love how the story progresses and how the characters who dislike and fight each other, ends up bonding together and find a way to live their lives. Since it has fantasy elements, you are gonna see problems related to Seulbi's powers too. The writers really blended in the fantasy elements to the problems and things high schooler faces like death of a family member, loneliness, trust in friendship and teenage puppy love. The OST's are beautiful, actors are pretty good (especially Kim Sae Ron), they have lot of comedy scenes and some real family problems and overall pretty cool school life scenes which are enough to remind you of your school days.  \u2606 Hwayugi/ A Korean Odyssey:-  The story is about a monkey God who is trapped and tricks a little psychic girl into releasing him from the prison. The little girl, who thought he would protect him from ghosts when he calls his name, grows up without remembering his name. Fate makes them meet again and after many ups and downs, they fall in love again. When it comes to fantasy and adventure rom-com that involves mystical creatures like Gods and demons, this drama is the best for me. It involves everything- a bull, a monkey, a pig, a zombie, a dog, a ghost, a dragon too. Every episode is filled with adventure/mystery and your couple solving them while they work on their own feelings for each other. But this was not the only memorable thing for me. It has tons of comedy scenes plus it has variety of characters and their interactions with each other is what I lived for. I loved everyone of them. The story is balanced with fantasy, adventure, bromance, fight, romance and comedy. I wouldn't talk more in depth because I might give out the entire story in order to explain what I loved more about it.  \u2606 Bing goo:-  Bing goo is actually a 2 episodes long drama which is about a man (Kim Jung Hyun) who is kind and compassionate and has a girl who loved him and he loved her to death. However, by unexplained phenomenon, he gets transported from 1979 to the present day and meets a girl who looks like the girlfriend of his best friend. She helps him to find the girl he loves while adjusting to the current world. This drama is short but it had me in tears. I rarely cry a river in dramas and this kdrama was the first to do so. It doesn't have a sad ending but I was so attached to the main lead, I feared he doesn't have a sad ending. This drama is short and yet it knows what to focus on. It's not a sci-fi or fantasy drama but a romance drama which beautifully potrays the unconditional love. Our leading man is kind and understanding and this changed the people around him too. But what I loved about this drama is the dedication and commitment he had for the only girl he loved in his life. He might appear like a fool but to me, he is someone who can even sacrifice himself for the happiness of his love, without any conditions. That's the reason he tried to understand her when he met her again. Now, I won't reveal much because it's already a short drama.  \u2606 My Holo love:-  This 12 episode drama ventures into science fiction and includes artificial intelligence along with being a romance drama. The story revolves around a woman who is lonely (because she has insecurities due to her face-blindness and doesn't socialize) and wishes for an emotional support. One day, she finds a pair of glasses in her bag and surprisingly after wearing it, she is greeted by a human looking like male AI that can be seen only through the glasses. The story is not complicated. It is simple and felt more real to me. What I like about this drama is how beautifully it incorporates the artificial intelligence theme to the human life. The characters in the drama including the leading man (Yoon Hyun Min), leading lady (Ko Sung Hee) have a very detailed characterisation and they are written and presented well. The Holo (also played by Yoon Hyun Min) is the person who helps them confront their insecurities, regrets and fears of the past. I prefer calling him a person because he feels and behaves more like a human than an actual human does. Not only this, I really like how main lead and female lead grows out of their shell they made and manages to live the life on their own terms, in the end. Other supporting characters are equally simple and good though the main focus is on our couple.  Image credit:- Pinterest ",

            "answer_text": "Do I watch Korean Dramas? Of course I do!!! I can practically stay in my room all day because I'm watching a Korean Drama. I'm pretty much addicted and I don't want to be saved. (Of course, I have a level of control. Don't mind my exaggeration up there!!!) Now let's get to the list. There's no ranking in this list. I just mention whatever comes to mind first. There are some dramas that will come like no. 4, 5 or even in the special mentions that I personally like more than the ones in no. 1, so please remember that there's no ranking. Starting with Historical Dramas: Yi San also known as Lee San, Wind of the Palace Starring Lee Seo Jin as King Jeongjo(Yi San) and Han Ji Min as Seong Song Yeon. This drama shows the importance and strength of love, loyalty and friendship. From his friendship with two non-royals, Song Yeon(whom he later falls in love with) and Park Dae Su(who becomes his most trusted soldier) to his loyalty to his subjects. San is a king who likes to go incognito and mingle with his subjects. He is a king who loves practicing martial arts with his soldiers and hates it when others risk their life for his. This drama displays a true King who is completely loyal to his subjects and at the same time is in a struggle as it is hard for him to be with the one he loves. Trust me, if you get emotional easily, there's no way you won't end up with a bit of tears while watching this. From romance, to action to mystery, it has it all. 2. Empress Ki  Starring Ha Ji Won as Ki Seungyang, Jon Jin Moo as Wang Yu and Ji Chang-Wook as Toghon Tem\u00fcr Seungyang is a low class woman born in Goryeo but after going through different struggles, near-death experiences, losing her first love and so on(I don't want to drop too much spoilers) she manages to make her way to the top and becomes the Empress of the Yuan Dynasty. This woman is a perfect description for a strong and independent woman. Beauty, brains and brawn, this woman has it all. 3. Dae Jang Geum  Starring Lee Young-Ae as Jang Geum, Ji Jin Hee as Min Jeong Ho, Hong Ri-Na as Choi Geum Young and so on This drama is about an orphaned girl who from a kitchen maid and then a royal cook becomes the greatest physician and the first female royal physician in the Joseon Dynasty. From accidentally being the cause of her parents death, burying her mother with her own hands, surviving by herself, finding her way into the palace, becoming a kitchen maid and being betrayed by her best friend, Jang Geum goes through a lot right from the beginning. The poster looks boring, I know, but give it a chance. Personally, I think it's worth watching. 4. Gu Family Book  Starring Lee Seungi as Choi Kang Chi, Bae Suzy as Dam Yeo Wool This drama is one that keeps you interested right from the beginning, that is, if you're interested in historical drama mixed with fantasy, action, suspense and romance. It centers on a half human, half gumiho, Choi Kang Chi who finds out the truth of his birth and goes in search of the Gu family book that holds the secrets to becoming human. Of course, the drama that precedes his birth is something that you should definitely watch (I don't want to drop any spoilers). Give this drama a chance, it's definitely worth it. Special mentions: Shine or go crazyMoon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo(I love this particular one. This is a MUST watch!!!)Mirror of the witchThe Moon Embracing the SunJumong (If you haven't watched this, you better start with this. This is where the beginning of your journey with Kdramas should start from, that is, if you're into historical dramas)Hwarang: The Poet Warrior YouthFaith also known as the Great Doctor as well as the most underrated drama Lee Min Ho has ever starred in.Arang and the Magistrate: Lee Joon Gi and Shin Min-A did a great job with this dramaThe Scholar who walks the nightLove in the moonlight, also known as Moonlight drawn by cloudsThe Princess' Man: Forget the name, this drama is amazing!!!The King's Daughter, also known as Su Baekyhang(Another MUST watch!!!)Warrior Baek Dong SooDong YiSix Flying DragonsThis is as much as I can remember, for now... Now to the dramas set in mostly modern times: You're all Surrounded Starring Lee Seung Gi as Eun Dae Gu/Kim Ji Young, Cha Seung Won as Seo Pan Seok, Go Ara as Uh Soo Sun, Ahn Jae Hyun as Park Tae -Il, Park Jung Min as Ji Gook This rom-action-com centres on five rookie detectives and their leader who work together to solve an 11-year old case. The case involves a missing boy whose mother was murdered. Unknown to them, this missing boy is in their midst and the murderer is very well known and close to them. The drama also centres on friendship, loyalty, trust and finding one's dreams. It's honestly an amazing drama with romance and comedy here and there to lighten the dark aura of the plot. 2. Goblin/Guardian: The Lonely and Great God  Starring Gong Yoo as Kim Shin, Kim Go Eun as Ji Eun Tak, Lee Dong Wook as The Grim Reaper/Wang Yeo, Yoo In-na as Kim Sun I have only four words for you, GO AND WATCH THIS!!! 3. The Beauty Inside  Starring Seo Hyun Jin as Han Se Gye, Lee Min Ki as Seo Do Jae, Ahn Jae Hyun as Ryu Eun Ho, Lee Da Hee as Kang Sa Ra This drama centres on a famous actress and an airline director who both suffer from very weird cases. The actress, Han Se Gye turns into a different person at a certain period every month and lives like that for a week while the airline director, Seo Do Jae suffers from prosopagnia(face blindness). In other words, he can't recognize people's faces. Both of them struggle with keeping their cases a secret while trying to figure what love means to each of them. We also see Ryu Eun Ho, a friend of Se Gye and a very charming young man who is determined to become a priest but this determination begins to fall when he meets Kang Sa Ra, Seo Do Jae's half sister. It's a very interesting drama and I highly recommend it. 4. Birth of a Beauty  Starring Han Ye Seul as Sara, Joo Sang Wook as Han Tae Hee, Jung Gyu Woon as Lee Kang Joon, Wang Ji Hye as Gyo Chae Yeon Sa Geum Ran (Ha Jae Sook) is a woman married to Lee Kang Joon, who has spent the past 7 years in the US doing business. Because she is \u2018fat' and \u2018embarrassing\u2019 to be around, she is treated terribly by her mother-in-law and sisters-in-law. However, this kindhearted woman still takes care of the whole family. Her husband returns with a mistress, Gyo Chae Yeon, a popular broadcast announcer, and decides to get a divorce. After several things happen, Sa Geum Ran gets involved in an accident that almost costs her her life. She survives and gets plastic surgery from head to toe and returns as South Korea's beauty. Several things take place, she encounters Han Tae Hee, a genius, or so he calls himself, with a sort of mysterious past and a journey of finding her self worth, true love and revenge begins. At first, the drama may seem to body shame women who don't fit to society's standards but dive deeper and you'll see that it's actually sending a message on the importance of self-worth. Special mentions: AthenaGood Doctor(There's even an American drama based on this. It goes by the same name as well).City Hunter, another underrated Lee Min Ho dramaYong Pal, also known as Gang DoctorShopping King LouieOh My VenusMy ID is a Gangnam BeautyYou're Beautiful (Old but gold. I love this drama!!!)Blood (Not a huge fan of the ending but it was a good drama)Strong Woman Do Bong Soon (Another must watch drama)Cinderella and the Four NightsUncontrollably FondHotel Del Luna (A must watch as well!!!)My Girlfriend is a GumihoVagabondMy Secret TerriusThere's also the dramas that Lee Min Ho has acted in, Boys Over Flowers, Legend of the Blue Sea, The Heirs (Not a huge fan of The Heirs but it's still interesting), and so on. In summary, I can't pick the drama that I like the most. They're all amazing. If you haven't watched any drama on this list, you better go and do so. ",

            "answer_text": "Oooh this is hard. I don't have favourites but I will list the ones that stood out and remained in my memory most in random orders. 1. Warrior Baek Dong-soo  It's an amazing story about brotherhood and friendship. Struggles, honour, betrayals and bonds. Amazing acting. Played by Ji Chang-wook  as Baek Dong-soo & Yoo Seung-ho  as Yeo Un. Their bromance in the story is amazing. They're polar opposites and the child actors who played them as when they were younger aced their characters as well.  2. I Remember You  It's about serial killers and two brothers separated from a young age. Both brothers are geniuses: one is a lawyer and the other is a criminal consultant/lecturer who also doesn't remember his brother due to the trauma that caused their separation. The drama centers around the mystery of how and why the brothers got separated and the murders that are linked to both of them. The drama is amazing and well thought out as it explores the mind of psychopaths and how they think and why they do what they do. Played by Seo In-guk as Lee Hyun and Park Bo-gum as Jung Sun-ho. I especially liked D.O from EXO's acting skills. He potrayed his character amazingly.  3. Healer  A night courier whose recent job got him entangled in a web of mystery and deceit which was linked to his and a tabloid journalist's pasts. Together, they uncover the truth about their history. Played by Ji Chang-wook as Seo Jung-hoo, Park Min-young as Chae Young-shin and Yoo Ji-tae as Kim Moon-ho. 4. Remember: War of the Son  A boy who has Hyperthymesia, a condition which allows him to have perfect memory and remember everything. His father, who has Alzheimer's, was wrongfully convicted of a murder to which he vowed to prove his father innocence by studying to become a lawyer. He was successful in becoming a lawyer, however, his attempts and work to prove his father's innocence isn't easy as the psychopathic criminal is wealthy and with connection. But his worst obstacle is his deteriorating memory. Played by Yoo Seung-ho as Seo Jin-woo, Park Min-young as Lee In-ah, Nam Goong Min as Nam Gyu-man and Park Sung-woong as Park Dong-ho. 5. You Don't Know Women  Amazing, amazing story. Really. This is one of the first kdramas I've ever watched as it was on tv and after all the years, it still remains as one of the best. Sadly, it's very hard to find online and I haven't found it. If anyone knows where to watch it, please let me know. It's about a lady who, after finding out about her husband's affair and being divorced, she discovered that she is pregnant. The story centers on how she got back on her feet after the mental abuse from her mother in law during her marriage and the emotional pain of being left for a prettier and younger woman. After years passed, she now has a stable career as a business woman and caring for her son alone. A handsome young man enters her life and courted her. It all became twisted however, when she found out the man is the CEO of her ex husband's company. Played by Kim Ji-ho as Lee Min-jung and Go Se-won as Park Moo-hyuk. 6. Descendants of the Sun  The on-screen couple who became couples in real life. A mix of romance, action and comedy, it's a great drama that deserves the attention it got. I actually checked this one out because I was curious to why so many people raved about it and I understood why they did. That's all for my list. There are many more dramas that is great too but this are the ones I can remember at the moment! ",

            "answer_text": "this list is based on my personal opinion and so you may or may not agree with it in no particular order\u2026 1.She was pretty A romantic comedy about two past acquaintances who meet again after they've gone through a reversal of fortunes and appearances, set in the backdrop of a fashion magazine's publishing office. this drama is undoubtedly one of the best ever made in 2015 and if you are a person who loves this typical everyday kind of romance, this is a perfect watch!  starring Hwang Jung Eum and Park Seo Joon with the lead roles supported by equally strong characters played by (super junior\u2019s) Choi Siwon and Min Ha Ri\u2026..this drama is a must watch! 2.Healer A decades-old incident involving a group of friends who ran an illegal broadcasting station brings together three different people\u2014an illegal mercenary with the codename \"Healer\" who happens to possess top-notch fighting skills, a reporter from a second-rate tabloid news website , and a famous journalist at a major broadcast station In trying to uncover the truth from that 1992 incident, they grow into real, honest reporters, and deal with the conflict between the truth and fate. this drama is by far my favorite action/thrileer kdrama i have watched and it is perfect in every aspect!  starring ji chang wook , park min young and yoo ji tae this drama was considered the best for 2014\u20132015 by kdrama fans all over the world! 3.W-two worlds its a love story of a surgeon who lives in the human world . she gets dragged into the world of a manhwa( korean comic)from time to time and develops a romantic relationship with the lead character/protagonist of the comic.  starring Lee Jong Suk and Han Hyoo Joo in the lead roles this drama is filled with twists and exciting action sequences as well as perfect romantic scenes which leaves you begging for more! my favorite drama for 2016 as of now! 4.Kill Me Heal Me Cha Do Hyun is a third-generation business heir who developed dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality disorder) in the aftermath of several life-threatening traumatic events. He tries to regain control over his life with the help of Oh Ri Jin, a first-year psychiatric resident who helps him secretly. But Ri Jin\u2019s twin brother, Oh Ri On , is a writer who is determined to uncover the unscrupulous lives of the rich and starts following Do Hyun around. Can Do Hyun take control over his condition before one of his seven personalities takes control over him instead? to the best of my knowledge this is the best psychological/romantic kdrama ever made and it covers a wide range of societal behavior and the dark side of rich families/(chaebol families)  starring Hwang Jung Eum, Ji Sung and Park Seo Joon this drama is an emotional roller coaster!. P.S Ji Sung has done a remarkable job portraying 7 different roles( the various personalities) much to an extent that you would not even realise its just one person. 5.Oh My Venus A personal trainer who suffers from an injury is hired by an overweight woman to help her with health issues. As they spend some time together, they fall in love and learn to deal with their problems. this is by far one of the most star studded cast in a kdrama which i have to say is visually perfect with the cast comprising of Shin Mina and So Ji Sub who are undoubtedly the best looking actors in kdrama world.  6.Hwarang: the beginning although this drama has not yet aired and will only air by late december 2016 i know this is gonna be on my list of my all time favorites as the cast comprises of all my favorite actors including two of my biases in kpop the cast consists of Park Seo joon in the lead with (ZE:A\u2019s)Park Hyunsik , SHINee\u2019s Choi minho and Kim Taehyung( more commonly known as V from BTS) this drama is going to be perfect The drama revolves around a group of youths who grow through passion and love in Seorabeol, the capital of the kingdom of Silla (during Silla dynasty)  SPECIAL MENTIONS:-you should watch these as well!

            "answer_text": "(The list is not in a particular order. I really enjoyed watching all these dramas wait no Dots is my bias and erm She was pretty is close to my heart too.) Descendents of the Sun This one is so effing amazing. It will literally keep you hooked up pretty much till the last episode. The storyline is pretty good. The characters are good. Omg Song Joong ki is love Song Joong ki is life. I finished this drama in two days. I cried and then laughed and then cried again. Did I mention it has a badass plotline? Okay I started writing a lil insight of this story but I don\u2019t know I just can\u2019t- dunno how to explain without unknowingly throw a spoiler into it. I hate it when someone accidently tells the spoiler like the other day my friend was like \u2018\u2026Anne Hathaway dies in the end but you have to watch the movie!\u2019 (oops) like what. My other friend was like wtf dude. Do yourself a favour and go watch the drama now like right now You can read the rest of the list later. She was pretty This is the most hilarious drama ever! I died laughing like a million times! It is a bit cliche tho but c\u2019mon korean dramas are supposed to be cliche psh. We live for cliche dramas Anywho,so yeah. Go watch it. Suspisious partner Plotline: typical korean drama plotline Lead guy: hot (JCW *sobs sobs* I\u2019m gonna miss him) Clicheness level: 101% Wait what else you want to see in a korean drama? Oh and it is thriller too. You gotta watch it. Boys over flower Oh this was my first ever korean drama! It is a bit overrated tho but if you love watching korean dramas and haven\u2019t watched it yet then you have to watch it! It has 4 good looking guys,a love triangle, lots of lovey-dovey stuff and an evil mother! Grab some popcorn and watch it! Heirs If you loved Boys over flowers then you will definitely love this drama. This drama stars Lee Min Hoo too! I thought it was way too melodramatic but i enjoyed it. Cheese in the trap This one is really good. I personally didn\u2019t like the male lead actor. Instead I fell for the second lead male actor. It is about friendship and college life. It stars some of the famous korean actors. I don\u2019t know why it is a bit under-rated tho \u2019cause hell i watched the whole thing in two days! Goblin  It is a beautiful beautiful drama. The plotline is amazing. You\u2019d love it! The ost(soundtrack) is pretty good too. Watch it! You\u2019re beautiful The story is about a girl who has a twin brother who is one of the member of a very famous band. He is suddenly sent to the U.S for some stuff I don\u2019t remember so now his manager asks his twin sister to pretend to be him for a few months. The other band members are 3 cute guys. Nobody knows about her identity except the manager. She faces loads of funny situations which were pretty hilarious to watch. Watch it! Big I don\u2019t know why this drama is way toooo underrated. I mean for crying out loud it casts Gong Yoo! It has soul-exchanging thing and loads of cliche moments. The female lead actress is pretty dumb but Gong Yoo\u2019s cuteness balances it thank god. It was a good watch. If you\u2019re a hardcore k-drama fan and havent yet watch this drama then girl, I recommend it to you. While you were sleeping Ah the most recent one. I don\u2019tlike Lee Jong-suk idk why. But I liked this drama. I watched this after watching Big \u2019cause it had Suzy Bae in it too.I haven\u2019t watch the whole thing yet. But I\u2019d really like to recommend it! Noble, My love Boy, this is one good drama. It is a short drama like one episode if of 15 minutes ,you can finish it in a day and I must mention it is very cute! You\u2019re gonna die after watching all those cute moments! (image source: google) Edit 1 : Go Back CoupleA love so beautiful(C-drama)With you (C-drama)My Huckleberry Friends (With you Spin off)Edit 2 : When we were young (2018) (C-drama) : I couldn\u2019t get enough of ALSB and With you, so I thought of giving it a try. It was good. But it mainly focuses on the youth so I was ahem I was about to give a spoiler XD And it has an open ending so fingers crossed I hope there will be a season 2 in future.",

            "answer_text": "Boys over flowersIf you are into romantic flicks, you'll love it. It stars Goo-Hye-Seon as Guem-Jan-Di.  Lee-min-ho as Gu-jun-pyo, seems he was born for this role.  and heart throbbing Kim-hyun-joong.  Plot: Boys over Flowers\u201d nails the assignment, more or less. Feisty, unfashionable dry cleaner\u2019s daughter Jan-Di (Gu Hye-Seon) clashes with the rich bullies at a fancy private high school, leading to violent face-offs between the young woman and the whole school. But opposites typically attract in these stories, and to everyone\u2019s surprise, she becomes unlikely girlfriend to the group\u2019s condescending ringleader, Gu Jun-Pyo (Lee Min-Ho). 2. Something in the Rain  This series will melt your heart. The amazing acting of Jung Hae In and Son Ye-jin and the chemistry speaks volumes to the emotional pull. I, as a viewer am experiencing. Both the main leads are doing such a wonderful job with their body language that you can virtually interpret their thoughts and emotions. It may seem effortless but I am sure this takes an immense amount of skill as well as the ability to trust in one's acting partner to lead as well as be lead into a wonderful mix of the push and pull of relationships. I find myself smiling like a silly fool. It also touches upon a lot of controversial topics like mistreatment/sexual abuse of women at their workplace and in general, romance between an older woman and a younger man, unhealthy/obsessive relationships, mother pressuring their children to only care about the background of people they hang out with and how they can benefit them, negative view on those without parents, on those who pursue an artistic career. Main leads are absolutely adorable together, have amazing chemistry and make you die from happiness while watching them interact.  ",

            "answer_text": "there are many best kdrama as far as I have watched till now. Instead of best korean drama, I want to share my favorite kdrama in 2015. Here they are : 1. Healer. Starring Ji Chang Wook and Park Min Young, the plot is interesting. I always like this kind of drama because it will make me more curious about next episode. And dont forget Ji Chang Wook is awesome in this drama, like Lee Min Ho in City Hunter :D  2. Pinnochio. This drama starring Lee Jong Suk and Park Shin Hye. This is another kdrama with great story. Lee Jong Suk became a reporter to find out what happens back then in his family who accused wrongly in society because of a reporter, Park Shin Hye mother. It will make you think \"is it really happens to media industries in reality?\" something like that.  3. Kill Me Heal Me. Ji Sung, Hwang Jung Eum, and Park Seo Joon did a great job in this drama. Ji Sung, has 7 different personalities and meet Hwang Jung Eum who is a doctor and become Ji sung private doctor. This drama make Ji Sung get a Daesang Award from MBC Drama Award 2015. Try to watch it and you'll love it!  4. Ex-girlfriend Club. You know Song Ji Hyo? If you watch running man you sure know her. I love her acting in Goong, Crime Squads, Emergency couple, and now Ex-girlfriend Club. I think she match well with all of her co-star, include Byun Yo Han. The story is unique and also Byun Yo Han's smile is cute, I love his smile.   5. Producer. Great actor and actress are here in this drama! Kim So Hyun, Cha Tae Hyun, Gong Hyo Jin, and IU are all my favorite. At first, I watch this drama because of them but I really like the story of this drama. They are awesome. Kim So Hyun get Daesang Award at KBS Drama Award thanks to Producers.  6. Sassy Go go aka Cheer Up!. Wanna see fresh drama with high school concept? Watch Sassy Go Go. Lee Won Geun (those cute smile :D), Jung Eun Ji, Ji Soo, Chae Soo Bin are all young actor actress with great acting. Although story bit flat but it kind of refreshing to watch this drama thanks to all cast.  7. Yong Pal. Joo Won always make drama he is starring to be number one spot beat other television. And it always great acting of him as a doctor who make an errand to pay his debt. Actually I didnt think Kim Tae will do great in this drama as I watched her performance in Jang Ok Jung, that disappoint me. But dont judge her before you watch this drama, you will completely change your opinion like me. I like her acting as a strong woman not a weak girl. This drama make Joo won also get Daesang at SBS Drama Award.   8. Oh My Ghostess. Jo Jung Suk and Park Bo Young have a great chemistry in this drama, and I just love them. The ghost, Kim Seul Gi, is great too. Im Joo Hwan is in this drama too so I exited to watch. It is rarely to see mix concept between cooking and ghost like in this drama but it become one of my favorite drama in 2015. I just watched this drama in 2 days :D  9. Second Time Twenty Years Old. TvN as a cable television have a great kdrama in 2015. Many drama that produced by it have good response and have good story too. In this drama, Choi Ji Woo, Lee Sang Yoon have good chemistry as a friend and as first love person. I love Lee Sang Yoon and his dimples and of course his acting, Choi Ji Woo always have great acting and I just like her. This drama will tell you many lesson in real life.  10. She Was Pretty. The last of my favorite list is She Was Pretty. After acted as brother-sister in Kill Me Heal Me, Park Seo Joon and Hwang Jung Eum pairing again as a lover in this drama! this is a romantic comedy drama that will make you laughing in each episode. I like all of the cast, the story, and their acting.  Hope you'll like it, and try to watch! :) ",

Second is Falling for Soon Jung ( also known as Falling for Innocence). Most posts I have seen suggest Boys Over Flowers. Watched it and really overall did not like it. I am sure people will complain about that comment. The girl\u2019s family was annoying and she was stupid for staying with the rich jerk. Much better I think if she had chosen the second lead. While the acting was good, otherwise I would not have such a strong opinion about the show, the whole story line just did not sit well with me. There is of course Descendents of the Sun, Full House, anything written by the Hong sisters,ex. Master\u2019s Sun And Greatest Love. Anything with these actors or actresses; So Jib Sub: The Master\u2019s Sun, O My Venus, I\u2019m Sorry I Love You Lee Dong Wook,: Blade Man, Goblin Great and Lonely God Jung Kyoung Ho: Heartless City, Falling for Innocence Cha Seung Woo: You\u2019re Surrounded! Man on High Heels Jung Il Woo: Cinerella and Four Knights, High End Crush, Gong Hyo Jin: The Master\u2019s Sun, Greatest Love Seo In Guk : Shopping King Louis, I Remember You, The Master\u2019s Sun Gong Yoo: Coffee Prince, Goblin Great and Lonely Goblin, Train To Busan Jang Geun Suk: You\u2019re Beautiful, The Happy Life Ha Ji Won: Secret Garden, King 2 Hearts Sung Hoon: O My Venus, My Secret Romance Kim So Yeon: Dr. Champ, Falling For Innocence, Iris Rain: Full House, R2B (Return To Base) These are just a few of what I have watched. Sometimes the acting is a little over top but I don\u2019t mind that. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to stir the pot by including some Kdramas that tend to be underrated and overshadowed by some of the more popular titles. The following may seem like an eclectic mix of recommendations, but if you\u2019re looking for quality storytelling and acting, all of these are a must-watch. 1. Ruler of Your Own World (melodrama) -- For those in the mood to be moved and inspired, watch this. An ex-convict seeks redemption after he is released from prison. The story may sound dark and heavy, but it\u2019s packed with enough hope and humor to keep you hooked. It\u2019ll make a person want to shake their fist at the world, Scarlett O\u2019Hara style, and vow to face tomorrow a stronger and better person.http://www.dramafever.com/drama/530/1/Ruler_of_Your_Own_World/ 2. Soulmate (romantic comedy) -- Not the typical Kdrama rom-com. This series elevates the genre into a hilarious and witty commentary on modern relationships. At turns laugh-out-loud, poignant, and insightful. http://www.dramafever.com/drama/20/1/Soulmate/ 3. Sign (crime drama) -- Even if crime dramas are not your thing, give Sign a chance. It offers a rare and honest glimpse into the corrupt reality of South Korea\u2019s political institutions, and it features a stellar cast. Best of all, Sign provides unexpected moments of romance and comedy that really balances out the suspense.http://www.dramafever.com/drama/3904/1/Sign/ 4. Sandglass (melodrama) -- Although Sandglass is considered to be the godmother of all Kdramas, it is not your prototypical, easily-digestible Kdrama in that it offers a glimpse into a very painful moment in South Korea's modern history. Still, its brilliant casting and storytelling made it an instant classic -- over 50% of Korea tuned into watch the series finale. It's an epic with great historical resonance. http://www.dramafever.com/drama/115/1/Sandglass/ There are plenty more quality Korean dramas that shatter the misconception that Kdramas are shallow, emotionally heavy-handed vehicles for pretty actors and actresses. See for yourself at DramaFever, a free video streaming website that offers Korean dramas for free (www.dramafever.com). ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I really can\u2019t answer with just one. I\u2019ll give you a choice: Signal. OMG. The out and out best time tweaker (not really time travel) that I\u2019ve EVER seen, including various great Star Trek episodes (I am a Trekkie) & a couple intense Doctor Who ones (Whovian as well). Consequences of changing the past - so well done! Nothing grandiose, world-shattering - just real cases (the Hwaseong serial murders in SK) that has never been solved, coupled with the Miryang gang rape case - or a facsimile thereof) with a lot of \u2018what if\u2019s that made complete sense. The premise is similar to the film Frequency (ie a young policeman in the present picks up an old walkie-talkie & finds himself in communication w/a detective from the 1980s) - but the plot! You think, oh the two saved someone - then find out the consequences to the future - it\u2019s like a maze. Ursula LeGuin\u2019s Lathe of Heaven comes to mind. Misaeng. The Office married to Dilbert, with an endearing cast of young interns, and done quite realistically. Funny, heartbreaking, maddening and scathing. Anyone who\u2019s worked in a cubicle factory like this recognized the culture immediately. Adapted from a manhwa which is equally awesome. Mother. Just ended. Nominated for a Cannes Award (the entry for SK - 9 other international entries). Adapted from an excellent Jdrama of the same name. Lee Bo Young deserves every award available for her performance here. Lee Hye Young - amazing - I cried buckets. The child actress - Heo Yool - loved that child. The story overtly addresses child abuse, but also what it means to be a mother to a child. Just Between Lovers. A drama that walked a fine line between makjang & romance, managing to transcend both. There\u2019s a love story here, between two damaged souls who\u2019ve survived a horrific mass accident (mall collapse), but how that accident affected everyone involved even peripherally weaves through the story, demanding attention. Healer. Just drama crack. Perfect performances, compelling storyline, and the BEST, most angst-free loveline I\u2019ve ever seen in a KDrama (out of the 300+ I\u2019ve watched). Ji Chang Wook OMG This is the one drama I\u2019ve watched multiple times. Ahjumma rules! EDIT & UPDATE: My Mister. A great character study, and interesting look at the life of an architect with a complicated family life and a close circle of friends. He\u2019s seen thru the eyes of a young girl, who struggles to take care of her ailing grandmother by taking any jobs she can - she\u2019s a temp at the architectural firm & is hired by someone at the company to find dirt on our lead guy. She taps his phone & can hear all his interactions with everyone - which gives her an insight into his character. GREAT drama. Dear My Friends. Just a charming, moving, realistic look at a group of friends who\u2019ve known each other since grade school and are now moving into old age. Lovely drama. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes I definitely do . So it comes as no surprise that I have watched too many of them to count, making it all the more difficult to choose my favourite. It is like a kid in a candy store kind of situation . I just love all of them . I believe kdrama in recent times have become so popular because of the fact that it caters to a wide range of audiences with its various genres. So I'll try listing out the ones that I believe has the right mix of everything. 1st : GOBLIN  No other drama has come close to making feel things like this one did . Although I was apprehensive initially as it was supposed to be having shades of fantasy weaved in to it I still went ahead to watch it as I curious to watch the older Gong Yoo in a drama after having watched him in another favorite of mine - Coffee Prince. There is only one word to describe the drama right from the very 1st episode until the very last - magical !! There is enough humor to make you laugh your heart out that you forget for a moment that it has a gut wrenching story line as well. You laugh one moment, you cry one moment and then you start rooting for the characters as they grow on you . Not many villains to hate , but plenty of characters to love and to cheer on. With a beautiful and scenic screenplay, your eyes will thank you for the feast and your heart for the bliss !!! 2. SUSPICIOUS PARTNER   Another rib tickling drama loaded with Scense and sensibility ! Beautiful people on screen , an engaging storyline with a villain who scares the crap out of you along with scenes so relatable that it almost looks like it was ripped off from your life !! Do watch it if you need one hell of ride of complete entertainment!!! ",

OK coming to point, Here is the list of my favourite korean series 1 BOYS OVER FLOWER. It's the first series I watched and it's my all time favorite .Its best suited series for teenagers and it's the best series to kick start .Its a story of 4 rich boys and a stupid girl. My god, those boys are really breath taking. (you might get huge crush on any one of those 4 boys) .I can just give one line story that it's all about love triangles with few other extra story added to it. It has a great story line ,but at some point you might get bored, I suggest you to forward those) . Overall ,it's really cool drama and deserves number 1 position. 2.My love from another star. It's a romantic comedy movie with a beautiful story line.Its suited people of all ages. It's a about man from another planet who lands up on earth and lives their for about decades together and then what when he meets a famous heroine and many more stories. At first it might be boring but when you catch the flow, you will surely like it. It's adds some visuals effects along with switch between present and past . It's just wow, the acting of leads looks natural and make you feel that you are just part of story. I would like to keep in 2nd position Just for its long story line( but their Is no unwanted story within it) . 3) Master\u2019s sun It's a mixture of Horror and romance .if you have fear of ghosts like me, then you better skip first episode. It's damn scary for people who rarely watch horror scenes.(may be because of visual effects) .but then episode go smoothly along with ghost being not scary. It's fun to watch it. The story is all about girl who is able to see ghost after an accident when she herself is scared of those. But then actor acts like sheild who protects her from ghost attacks .cause when she holds him, the ghosts disappears .Its has best story within it, and I suggest you to watch it because everything within it is just perfect. The romance, horror or comedy doesn't make you bore and makes you just see the episodes all again. I would like to keep in 3rd position because of its first 2 scary episodes(ha ha ha). 4) Healer It's a action romantic series.the chemistry between leads is eyecatching .The main reason why I liked it the series is because ahjumma,she is one of the main character making you fall with series. The acting, plot and narration is just perfect.i suggest you to watch it as well . 5) Legend of blue sea What can be more than watching your favourite stars together.yaa,it stares one of the lead from boys over flowers (Lee min ho) and actress from my love from another star. LOBS has different plot than other series. It's about Mermaid (yaa, it is) .It includes past life story as well. Its unique and beautiful .The story is very clean and planned ,and has power to make you believe that mermaid exists. It's just Perfect but at certain point it's boring. 6) 49 days It's a beautiful story and 49 days is not just random number, it has a deep story connected. It's has story filled mystery, suspense, romance, souls and scheduler .series is filled with emotions and makes you get connected to it as well. It's about girl who mets with an accident and turns into soul. And story continues from their. I don't want to reveal anything cause it worth watching. 6) Goblin It's an romantic story with lots of things added to it. It's basically about a warrior who turns into goblin after his death and cursed that only goblin bride can remove the sword (confused?!) ,It's worth watching it than me saying the plot. The visual effects is very good and it complete the story .Its one of my favourite story. 7) Pinocchio It's a very serious drama with a deep story. If you are teenager than it might be slight boring for you.i think the storyline of Pinocchio is quite different and it's all about reporters. 8) Goong It's well suited for teenagers, its bit royal involving prince ,princess etc. It has beautiful story .i found it bit lengthy . 9) Coffee prince It's a romantic comedy series ,it has a beautiful story line and makes you enjoy very bit of it. It's a about girl lying that she is man and Joins a coffee shop where her boss falls in love with her and then what happens when he realizes that she is girl. 10) heartstrings Its yet another teenage love story. Its has good story with a smooth narration. I don't know why I like, but it's my favourite. Everything in it makes me to watch it again and again .It is musical romantic story ,where male lead is a western music student and heroine is traditional music student . It is love hate story which is narrated beautiful. 11) my girlfriend is a gumiho ,rooftop prince, k2,city hunter,personal taste,you are beautiful. These series are also good . That's the end of series. In case if you are planning to watch Korean movie ,I have listed out 3 movies I liked personally My little bride, baby and me and my sassy girl . ",

            "answer_text": "Currently, I have 3 dramas and in no particular order. Healer This drama is one of those rare dramas that is not disliked by many people because everything about this drama is absolutely lovable. Amazing leads, superb acting and laudable story- this drama has everything. Oh, and Ji Chang-wook is a delight to watch as he plays this role with all his efforts, making him the star in this drama. Every character has a story and every story is interconnected. It\u2019s a win-win in its genre.  Secret Garden I absolutely love this drama. And there are just 100 reasons for me to love it. The first and foremost reason has to be Hyun Bin- he, his role, his acting, his looks, his voice and his dimples- the way he plays both the arrogant CEO Kim Joo-won and the stuntwoman Gil Ra-im (after the souls are interchanged) is a delight. But, Ha Ji-won is no less. She was an amazing counterpart and the way she plays the role of Gil Ra-im with such prowess was amazing. Supporting actors too were really strong-headed There\u2019s everything in this drama- comedy, fantasy, emotions, some really good scenes and amazing OST.  My Love From Another Star Save the best for the last! There\u2019s absolutely no doubt that the way this story is written is much more interesting than many other movies or serials (American and British shows included). It\u2019s an alien-Hallyu actress love story, set between the past and present, with the alien Do Min-joon falling in love with the adult version of the lookalike of his first love of 17th century! He uses his powers of teleporting and stopping time in some of the most interesting ways. Again, all the characters are interwoven among each other. This short description itself sounds so interesting that no one could skip this drama. Jun Ji-hyun is the most amazing actress in my dictionary after watching her in this drama. She is simply the best. ",

            "answer_text": "Gonna use one from my previous answer cause I wanna share it to the world or the universe rather that I\u2019m confidently inlove with these dramas. Note: this is not in chronological order but Goblin is my best choise for spot no. 1 It\u2019s okay, that\u2019s love.  I\u2019ve watched it\u2019s okay, that\u2019s love and it was totally a must watched, it triggers my interest on psychology although it takes psychological illness quite exaggerated that sometimes it\u2019s cringy already. It\u2019s still is fine plus the main actress with Jo Insung in it, it was a total win win, as they portray their part so well I almost believe them. Goblin  Goblin is the best for all time kdrama, although I\u2019m the only one who keeps on pushing that one cause my friends and family don\u2019t even want to watch it no matter how I promote it to them. I remembered rewatching goblin for like over and over for 3 months. That winter, the wind blows.  It\u2019s not because of Zo Insung but practically I start watching this because of him haha.Zo Insung and Song Hyekyo in one 1 drama. What can you ask for? The plot is basic yet you\u2019ll never know what will happen next. It will make you want to watch episode after episode until you realize you just end it all. If you\u2019re tired of clique and light kdrama , you need to watch this ASAP. Chicago Typewriter  It\u2019s an unfortunate love from the past ( from the war days in Korea) that was given a chance to met again today. It will make you think of how much suffering our ancestors have to go through just to have the freedom that we have today, that they even have to give up their love ones just for that freedom. This was worth a try I promise. But if you\u2019re feeling low and needs some happy pill\u2026 The best hit  It makes me crack up for days of watching it. Your typical clique and light kdrama with a twist. Try it and thank me later. Wink. ",

The characters are one of my favorites, their interactions are ones I really like. Especially those between the main couple, holy shit, the chemistry! They dated in real life which shows when you look at their scenes together, the way they look at each other is so fucking adorable, oh my god.   goalsgoalsgoals Also, a plus is that the main is really attractive. He\u2019s a swimmer in this, take a look:  Nam Joo Hyuk, bless you. His character is also very charming, he appears cold and like he doesn\u2019t really care (to Bok Joo, at least), but when he\u2019s actually a very sweet and caring person. He\u2019s my type of man, said every girl watching the drama. Ooooh, let\u2019s not forget my babe Lee Sung Kyung, she\u2019s very boyish in this and is always seen wearing loose fitting, comfy clothes. What with being a weightlifter and all. But her cute lil face does not go unnoticed, not by these eyes!  She\u2019s so pretty, god bless. All in all, it\u2019s a 9/10. Happy ending guarnteed. Watch if you wanna feel blessed by the god himself, especially after watching something heartbreaking like Scarlet Heart: Ryeo and Unconditionally Fond. They\u2019ll make you cry. Don\u2019t do it. Save yourself\u2026 Do it. They\u2019re worth it. ANYWAYS! I\u2019ll leave you with one last cute gif to lure you in, have a good day ;)  ",

Tempted / The great seducer This is such a dark drama and it was my first kdrama I watched. Woo do hwan is soooo amazing in this. I loved his character. 2. Itaewon Class  This is my ultimate favourite kdrama I've ever watched till now. I've watched this drama 2 times now. You can tell by this how good this must be. Park seo joon is love \u2764\ufe0f although this wasn't my first drama of him. The plot line, actors, OST all are sooo good. I can't find a flaw in this. 3. Melting me softly  This was my first ji chang wook oppa kdrama. I started this drama when it was on air and loved it. This is a good watch 4. Cheese in the trap  Park hae jin \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d I just watched this drama for him and his beautiful smile \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01 soooo cutee. Although overall it's a good drama. 2nd lead syndrome is sooo high in this. I feel bad for him \ud83d\ude14 5. What's wrong with secretary kim?  Well this was my first park seo joon drama I started when the lockdown occurred. This is soooo good. I guess his every drama is soo good. I love this. Every drama of his has interesting plot line and his aura is there as well \ud83d\ude02 6. Suspicious Partner  Another ji chang wook drama. It's a good one time watch. Nam ji Hyun and ji chang wook chemistry is lit in this \u2728 7. Fight for my way  This is such a cutee drama. Kim ji won and park seo joon are soo amazing in this. This is a perfect rom com +friendship drama. I can watch this so many times butstill won't get over with it. 8. She was pretty  Sorry not sorry. Park seo joon oppa is love \u2764\ufe0f I binge watch his all works after itaewon class. This is another one. This is a old drama of his but it is really nice. It is loaded with comedy done by 2nd male lead for whom I felt sooo bad at last and I cried. But still this is really good. That's it. \ud83d\udc9c ",

I have watched around 40 korean dramas by now and 1 chinese drama out of which the supernatural kdrama happens to be my favorite genre. For my top favorote kdramas, I suggest, Pinnochio .

Those dramas are super good with highly talented and handsome actors and actresses, and I adore all the comedy scenes coming up now and then.

So, Korean dramas I like the most: Dr. Stranger (Lee Jong-suk\u2019s acting is so good!)Pinocchio (Lee Jong-suk is so adorable!)W (Leeee... :3) By now, you might have guessed that Lee Jong-suk is my favorite actor.

            "answer_text": "I wouldn't recommend typical popular k dramas like Boys Over Flowers, The Heirs, Winter Sonata, etc. K dramas keep improving year after year. 1. Beautiful Gong Shim - the wittiest drama I've ever seen. Minah portrays a cute, clumsy artist wannabe who rents out her house in hopes of saving enough money to study in Italy, and she meets no other than An Dan Tae, a lawyer for the poor. The drama is full of funny moments, with a touch of mystery that makes it more than just a shallow rom-com. 2. The King of Drama - centred in the South Korean film industry, it tells of a formerly ruthless PD and a scriptwriter who come together to revive his career. His ex-girlfriend and now a huge star also happens to be playing the first female lead in the drama within a drama. Plenty of oppourtunity for kisses, nostalgia, and scheming. 3. Please Come Back Ahjussi - Rain Bi stars in this slightly melodramatic drama on two guys who get a chance to come back to life in new bodies and fix their regrets. A touching drama that will invoke tears, laughter, and surprise. 4. Doctors - currently airing! Park Shin Hye makes a great gangster-turned-doctor who is trying to solve the death of her grandmother, who died during surgery. She meets her teacher again, who this time is vying for her love. Hard to explain but really good!Written Jul 25 \u00b7 Taken from my answer to a similar question. I've also written answers for good makjang drama recommendations and the best Korean movies. ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re into rom com, pls check out my answer herePreetanjali Ray's answer to What are the best Korean dramas? In addition to the above list, you can also check out the following dramas:1. \u2018Suspicious Partner\u2019 and \u2018Fight For My Way\u2019 - Would highly recommend it. One of the best of the recent times. 2. Falling for Innocence- Someone recommended this to me and I loved it. And trust me, it\u2019s pretty good. Very different storyline with amazing cast. 3. Healer- Must watch. No others words. Ji Chang Wook at his best. Even better than in K2(<-another good drama) or Suspicious Partner. 4. Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Ju- It\u2019s just so cute! The couple is adorable and Nam Joo-Hyuk is simply amazing. (Was very disappointed after watching him in \u2018Bride of the Water God\u2019 :(( ) 5. Master\u2019s Sun- I must say the storyline is really unconventional which revolves around a girl who can see ghosts and her saviour who can help her get rid of them, but eventually they go around helping ghosts with the problems of their past life. It really is a delight to watch and So Ji- Sub is so funny. 6. Oh My Ghostess- Another show based on the ghost concept, with Park Bo Young and Jo Jung Suk, though the plot is entirely different. The story is very well written and will keep you glued until you finish. 7. It\u2019s Okay, It\u2019s Love- I love this show for it\u2019s amazing OST. Though, it has a good story and all, but I just cannot get over the OST. It\u2019s simply one of the best. 8. School 2017- Though I haven\u2019t watched the previous seasons of the School Series, but I really liked this one. It\u2019s still ongoing but it\u2019s pretty interesting to watch the story unfold.

            "answer_text": "I started watching K-dramas in 2015 and haven\u2019t had a day with out them since. Seriously, even when I travel, I find a way to stream a K-drama or two. Depending on your taste, you should do a bit of research to start with. I started with a historical and loved the East/West mythology mashup, the clothing, and intro into Korean heaven. Moon Embracing the Sun had lavish costumes and a touch of fantasy along with great actors. It hooked me. Then I went with a tried and true contemporary, Secret Garden. All dramas are character based, have an overall theme, and contain some type of romance with arias similar to an opera. I\u2019ve watched so many at this point I can\u2019t remember all of them. However, a few do come to mind. For RomComs: I\u2019d go with Again, Oh Hae Young. It has an amazing cast and a touch of fantasy. Oh My Venus hooked my husband and he watched several K-dramas with me, afterwards. For contemporary Drama/Fantasy, I\u2019d definitely watch Goblin, Great and Lonely God. Fabulous cast, great interaction between male leads and a terrific ending. For real Drama, I\u2019d pick up Call Me Mother, but be warned, it will pluck your emotions down to the core. My Mister is another drama and it deals with several contemporary Korean issues from finances to the changing face of family. Also, SkyCastle, an international hit, deals with educational competition and the lengths families will go to obtain admission to high-end universities. There are also drama sites on the Internet where fans discuss favorites. Check them out. K-dramas should come with a warning label: Highly Addictive. Enjoy ",

            "answer_text": "I'm going to list a few which I've actually watched. 1. Orange marmalade:  Set in a fantasy world where humans and vampires coexist, the latter have evolved and no longer rely on human blood as food. Still, they are feared and discriminated by society, causing many of them to hide their true nature and live as \"normal\" citizens, or else become outcasts. [Okay, don't say it's cliche. This stuff is really different than twilight and Evernight{Book Series by Claudia Grey (female vampire)}, you should watch it once.] 2. I'm sorry, I love you:  Cha Moo-hyuk is a small-time scam artist working the streets of Australia. He was abandoned by his parents as a child and he was adopted by a couple in Australia.[2] Unfortunately, he was mistreated by his foster parents and thus roams the streets, cheating tourists out of their money when they are lost. It is through one of these scams that he bumps into Song Eun-chae. 3. Autumn in my heart:  The story begins with toddler, Yoon Joon-suh accidentally causing the switch of his sister and another baby when he drops the name cards on the two babies' cribs in the hospital's baby room. A nurse who comes in puts the name cards back incorrectly. 4. Emperor of the sea:  Jang Bogo (Choi Soo-jong) rises from a lowly slave to the military commander of the sea during the Unified Silla Dynasty. Along the way, he battles pirates, and engages in a heated rivalry with Madam Jami (Chae Shi-ra), a Silla noble who squares off against Jang Bogo for trade rights in the South Sea. Yeom Jang (Song Il-gook), Jang Bogo's charismatic comrade, supports Jang in his ascension to become the \"Emperor of the Sea.\" But Yeom Jang competes with Jang Bogo for the love of Lady Jung-hwa (Soo Ae). 5. Sassy Girl (or Delightful Girl):  Chun-hyang is smart and sassy and becomes involved with good looking Mong-ryong. His first love Chae-rin enters the picture. An older man, Hak-do, pursues her. Will they find their way back to each other? And many more. These are the ones I've watched myself. Good ones thought ",

            "answer_text": "My love from star My first k- drama was rich man poor woman but still I haven't watched all of it's episode, this one was second and I wasn't able to stop myself watching it. It has comedy, romance, suspense and the combination is great. It is also translated in many languages including hindi. (Hamesha) hindi version's name. The Queen of the ring I was just watching it because of Ahn hyo-seop, lead actor, I really kinda like the way he gets into his character. but it also has a great motivating story, And there are only 6 episodes. After watching it Ahn hyo-seop is my favorite actor! It has some flavor of humor too. My Id is gangnam beauty Like the previous one, this one too deals about anxiety people have because of looks. It is having a good lesson with happy ending and is fun watching this is story of college students. Sweet revenge/ Revenge note (1,2) Story of high school students, even though these stories are very basic but made beautifully. I am a teenager and I loved it. It does not have much romance like it feels by reading title. I literally had vibes of 13 reasons why but Hannah Baker was helpless and this girl gets an app (God knows from were) which takes revenge for her. Thirty but still seventeen After watching Ahn hyo-seop in queen of ring I went for this one, again he is amazing (playing role of sweet, kind, energetic teenager) but not as a lead role. Story is very basic, but sometimes makes viewer sad, like how our small wrong decisions can destroy others life. Top management If you are interested how k-pop bands are made, and how everything works, this one is best, beautifully embedded in a story. Abyss Crime investigating story with some magical twist, loving it as I am still not able to watch all episodes. A teen (1,2) Available on YouTube most trending highschool drama with friendship, exams pressure etc. Strong women Do Bong Soon Ever wanted female character more stronger then Male lead character? Check it out. Package of action, comedy, romance. Weightlifting fairy kim bok joo Comedy, college life! Dr Kim (season 2) By now you have already got a idea that I really like Ahn hyo-seop's work so another great medical drama. Boys over flowers I don't know why this k drama is so popular. But the songs are really great, plus you will get attachments to the characters. The side love story is way more better then what's going on with main leads. You will fall for second male lead. I have seen 2 other ( Witch's love, that man oh soo) but there ending was not at all good, so I would not recommend to watch them. ",

Now I know the first episode is always the boring episode cause of course it is starting of a drama so if you already feel bored or eh this is not really good, an advice is WATCH THE FIRST 3 EPISODES and then decide for yourself. Well enough for now, to list some of my favorites (and you should try them out too): The Legend of the Blue SeaWAre You Human?Sky CastleDescendants of the SunExtraordinary You (this drama be a little cliche tho but trust me, at the end its good)VagabondSuspicious Partner And I think thats it, I do have WHOLE lot of the others but these are some few that I really liked!

            "answer_text": "The best Korean drama I've ever come across was a series called Iris.  I came across it a while after I came across its add on series ATHENA--something I stumbled upon by accident because I was looking up Choi Si Won from the new Taiwanese drama of the popular manga series Skip Beat.   The thing about Iris was that it was so well made that 99% of the time, you forgot it was a drama.  The show plays a lot like American shows like Nikita or 24.  It has long drawn out setups and lots of talking, coupled with extreme and sometimes bone chilling action.  Unlike American shows where we ignore the effects of say... what a car blowing up right next to you would do to you, this show doesn't.  The fighting is incredibly good and the story is too.  The budget for this drama was over 20 billion won ($17mil U.S.).  They brought in people from other nations to speak their native languages, and traveled to other countries to shoot.  They also made an add on drama to the series called: Athena: Goddess of War.     Another bonus is that the cast in both shows are not only all excellent actors, but they have the looks too.  You won't be sitting there wishing you were watching Boys Over Flowers instead...  And for anyone who's into the romance aspect of dramas, this show won't leave you out in the cold.  It has plenty of romantic drama mixed in to keep you happy.  For anyone who enjoys action thrillers and Korean dramas, these two are a must see. ",

            "answer_text": "Dramabeans.com is a great resource for recaps (http://www.dramabeans.com/category/k-drama), reviews (http://www.dramabeans.com/category/drama-reviews), and ratings (http://www.dramabeans.com/about/ratings) of a ton of dramas. I would recommend checking out the ratings section for a quick overview of the good, the bad, and the meh. As for my personal favorites, aside from the ones already mentioned, I would also add: My Name is Kim Sam SoonClassic k-drama and what started it all for me. Hilarious comedy with great (and now well-known) cast members. Sometimes referred to as the Korean \"Bridget Jones Diary\". On-Air (2008)Another classic in my opinion, and one of my favorite OST's. Explores the private and professional lives of those in TV drama production. Good writing with lots of meta, romantic, and comedic moments throughout. Another great (and well-known) cast. City HunterOne of the best dramas this year. An action thriller with a quest for revenge/justice (think Monte Cristo) as the driving plot point. Love the two leads and their chemistry - they're a couple in real life now! Was pretty happy with the writing throughout the run of the series. Dream HighFilled with k-pop stars so not the greatest acting in the world but sincere efforts all around. Has singing, dancing, and decent character growth. Another favorite OST of mine. Park Jin Young (CEO of JYP Entertainment) is surprisingly and wonderfully entertaining in his role. The Man Who Can't Get MarriedA fun comedy with a quirky but eventually loveable male lead. Secondary characters and storylines are pretty enjoyable as well. ",

            "answer_text": "These are my favorite: Descendants of the SunGenre: Drama, Romance A soldier\u2019s and a doctor\u2019s second chance at love (in Uruk). This is a must. It has a right to be so famous. I loved the idea of what it meant to be a \u201cdescendant of the sun\u201d (although it\u2019s not clearly stated in the drama). The love between a man who lives to kill and a woman who lives to save people and their chemistry makes this drama my favorite. Age of YouthGenre: Slice of Life, Suspense, Comedy Five college girls live in a dorm. They all have different life situations and personalities. This drama had bad ratings but some of the best reviews I had ever seen, so I watched it. I will never regret that decision. Every girl from the dorm is unique and relatable from the introverted to the girl that can see ghosts. A really great drama if you like slice of life. Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok JooGenre: Slice of Life, Romance, Comedy Kim Bok Joo is a weightlifter that experiences love for the first time. This will bring a lot of problems and new experiences that will change her life. Another hidden gem. This cute college couple will change your life. It takes subjects such as insecurities, traumas, abandonment, goals and career struggles and completely shakes you. Goblin, the Lonely and Great GodGenre: Supernatural, Comedy, Romance A goblin lives for 900 years looking for a wife. He finally founds her, a high schooler that was supposed to die at the womb, but he starts to question if he wants to die. After a turn of events, he ends up living with a grim reaper. Although there were some points were I was just annoyed (there\u2019s a limit to my pity) by the girl, it is amazing. The Grim Reaper and Goblin relationship is the best thing to ever happen in Korean dramas. The plot twists and the funny moments will hook you up until the end. My Love From Another StarGenre: Supernatural, Romance An alien has three months left in Earth when he finds himself mixed up with an actress and a psychopath killer. A classic. Frankly, I liked her more in this drama than in The Legend of the Blue Sea. It\u2019s a perfect mix of comedy, supernatural and suspense. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Other dramas worth mentioning: Coffee Prince (gender bender must)Pinocchio (mainly because it\u2019s one of the main reasons I chose to major in Journalism)You\u2019re All Surrounded(the best police drama out there)Let\u2019s Fight Ghost (cutest dynamic duo ever)City Hunter (my first kdrama)To Be Continued (Just.

            "answer_text": "If you love the plot of poor girl meeting rich boy as a child, then separated by the injustice of class-differences; or the perfect couple threatened when one almost dies or becomes blind; or when one gets hit by a car, suffers memory loss, then regains it after the lover has moved on; or like stories about a physically deformed person... k-dramas are for you!  get lots of tissues. my favs... 1.  Winter Sonata.  Classic love story  2.  Surgeon Bong Dal Hee.  i'm not sure if it's too medical for non-medical people, but they give explanations of medical terms :)  Dramatic love.   3. Full House .  Rain is cute. Romantic comedy   4.  Jewel in the Palace (Da-jang-kum) I haven't seen this, but everyone seems to love it.  Historical piece  if you want more info, http://koreanfilm.org/tvdramas/index.htm  has a good listing, though I've not seen many of these.  I'm taking an abstinence-only approach to k-dramas at the moment. a great sites for k-dramas: www.dramafever.com and www.soompi.com There was one I liked - a perfect couple, got in a car accident, woman became blind, left her lover since she wanted him to have a better life, then they ran into each other years later and he gave her his eyes. What was the name of that one? ",

            "answer_text": "I got addicted to k dramas last year and till now I watch them everyday. There are already many which I have seen. But the best which i have seen many times already and are very popular are: My love from another star- It stars Kim Soo Hyun and Jun Ji Hyun. The leads are perfect in looks and their chemistry is also perfect. If you want a drama with Fantasy, Romance, a bit of comedy, good cast and interesting story, then this is for you.Personal taste- It stars Lee Min Ho and Son Ye-jin. It is not that popular. But I would recommend it if you need a drama which has comedy, romance and which does not go overboard. It will not let you down. And it's small i.e only 16 EPs. I love it. It's my fav. So give it a try first. It's the best here in this list according to me.Legend of the blue sea- It stars LMH and Jun Ji Hyun. It is a must watch. It has everything like a bit of past and present fusion, comedy, romance and the concept is also totally new. The main female lead is also a mermaid here. Once you start you will love it and not regret it for sure.City hunter- Again it's a LMH drama. It stars LMH and Park Min Young. It's action packed. At first I thought action thing is not for me and seeing the synopsis I was disappointed. But the drama is totally different. Give it a try if you like LMH. It's a must if you are just new to k dramas. Try it now.Noble my love- It stars Sung Hoon and Kim Jae Kyung. Although it's not my fav, still I recommend it bcoz it was my first K-drama. And it's the reason I kept looking for more and more dramas later on. It is short so I feel you will like it even more.Playful kiss- It stars Kim Hyun Joong and Jung So Min. It is a story in high school set up. If you are tired of watching the dramas where a rich guy falls for a poor girl, this one's for you. Here the main female lead is in love with the main male lead from the beginning. It might not look good, but look for the synopsis and trailer and I am sure you would love it. And also the female lead is so cute her acting will force you to stick to the drama till the very end.Boys over flowers- It stars Lee Min Ho and Ku Hye Sun. It's a drama of 2009 but still is among the very bests even now. I did not want to watch it bcoz it's pretty long 25 EPs. But if you want a high school theme and handsome and rich guys, a beautiful female lead and the main male lead to be arrogant types then this is for you. You might have heard about it already, it's so popular.Sassy go go or Cheer up- It stars Lee Won Kuen and Jung Eun Ji.It's a mini drama i.e 12 eps series, so I saw it. The chemistry b/w the male and female lead is perfect. Although the female lead is not that pretty according to me, the male lead,his smile will keep you sticking to the drama till the very end.You are beautiful- It stars Jang Keun -Suk and Park Shin Hye. It's all music. The male lead, his facial expressions kept me go through the drama till the very end. There are two others male lead who collaborate very well with the story. Park Shin Hye is all cute and innocent having a double role here which does not show much till the end.These are the ones I have already seen and I have tried to arrange them in the order I like. These are must watch if you are new to k-dramas. Even if you are not, try these they will not disappoint you. Faith.Fated to love you.Heirs.Innocent guy or nice man.Full house.First shop of coffee prince.Goong or princess hours.My princess.Oh my lady.These are also good. I have seen all of them. I have seen many others but these are the best by far now. Descendants of the sun.My girlfriend is a gumiho.Sungkyunkwan Scandal.Moon embracing the sun.Dream high and Dream high 2.Pinocchio.These are the ones of which i have already read the synopsis and loved it. I will be watching them soon. So you too give it a try. They are among the most populars right now. DOTS (first one) is among the recents, I have seen some eps. Watch it if you have not yet started.

They are amazing actors and the chemistry was so beautiful to watch. Infact, all the characters were casted perfectly. I enjoyed the transition and intermingling of past and present. The book shown in the drama was so well presented that I did end up reading the book. Plus, the factual or analyzing anecdotes made the drama more enjoyable for me. I love smart, witty and humorous dramas and this certainly fit the criteria for me. I highly reccomend it to everyone. It is a drama so well executed that I constantly watch it over and over again. The second drama that I enjoyed immensely is \u201cOh my Venus\u201d. I have to admit that I wanted to watchthe drama because of the main actor. He is so Hot! However, its the story that captivated me. It was the first drama that I watched while it was on air so I anxiously waited every week for its english subtitled uploads. Each character left an impact for me. Heck, it motivated me to work out and take better care of myself. The plot line are weaved into the main story so wonderfully. Its an emotional, beautiful, and funny drama - a must watch for all Korean dramas lovers. Though, I love and watch many K-dramas, these two made a lasting impact for me. ",

I was really into all the school dramas from both Japan and Korea bc I thought it was so cool to see comraderie in their classes and schools, such an opposite in western schools, compared to my own experiences, which I hated. School dramas were like an ideal school life for me lol. But now that I'm older, I find myself more into serious, real life topics like serious relationships, family, work, and slice of life. I like shows not just for the hype, but generally, long-time drama fans can pick up on good quality. So I actually do watch for well-produced shows with good acting and well-paced stories.

            "answer_text": "I never watch Korean dramas, but I do watch some shows occasionally. I\u2019ve already answered to a very similar question, so I will post a portion of it here. Original link: Jangwon Suh's answer to What are some of the best Korean variety shows? This is the best variety show in Korea in my opinion: \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\ud68c\ub2f4 (Non-Summit) - A talk-variety show where people from countries around the globe who can talk in Korean discuss about various subjects and ideas. It was a very fresh new concept to the Korean variety show business. I really like the show. Key Members: Yoo Se-yoon, Jeon Hyun-moo, Seong Shi-gyung, and many non-Korean panels Some other notable best shows are: \uc18d\uc0ac\uc815 \uc300\ub871 - A human psychology debate show where they talk about human\u2019s various psychological behaviors by giving real life experiments. A Korean legend of the Metal music genre, Shin Hae-cheol, appeared at the first episode of \uc18d\uc0ac\uc815 \uc300\ub871 and soon passed away due to medical malpractice. Sad. \uc370\uc804 - A politics debate show, but it tries to speak for both right-wings and left-wings and keep the debate entertaining and light to approach to the general public. \ub9d0\ud558\ub294 \ub300\ub85c - A reality talk show where guests go out to the streets, gather up citizens and talk about their lives. \uc5b4\uca4c\ub2e4 \uc5b4\ub978 - A lecture-and-debate show where people with expertise stand in front of a small audience, give out lectures, and have debates. It\u2019s similar to TED, but is longer, and interacts with the audience. Really fun. Unfortunately, all four of these shows do not seem to be introduced to non-Korean viewers. They don\u2019t even have a proper English name for it. If your Korean is good enough, you should definitely try watching these. ",

DESCENDANTS OF THE SUN For a beginner of Kdrama , this would be perfect as it has too many shades ; two entirely different professions . The best thing about this drama is it never dissappoints you, and it has a vast range of emotions. 2. MY LOVE FROM OTHER STAR  I just loved this drama , it has 21 episodes and you will get comedy , a beautiful love story and a perfect blend of excitement . To my surprise it never went boring in any of the episode like any other drama . The acting of lead actors will left you in a sate of wow, they acted so naturally. One thing which may remain in your mind after completing this drama is what has happened after the final episode to the lead character ? 3. HEALER  As i am a big fan of JI CHANG WOOK(main lead actor) , to watch him in this drama is a blessing to me. For those who love action- romantic theme, this is a good one to watch. And you can also fall in love with wook after watching him in this one. 4. It\u2019s okay that\u2019s love  After watching this drama you will surely learn some psychological tips . Every other person in real life is suffering from some type of problems and this drama can give you you why actually this happens to us. Good comedy, romance, this drama\u2019s ost are the gem. 5. Jealousy incarnate  The theme itself is so much exciting , that you would love to watch the scenes again and again to just get the feel again. These are my top 5 till now , hope to see much more good KDRAMA in the future. My favorite one - My love from other star ",

            "answer_text": "I got into watching them because of a friend-cum-spiritual mentor of mine who lived and watched them in Singapore. Based on her recommendations I watched a few of them. Loved almost all of them Love from a Star - Is my most favorite. I\u2019ve watched this twice. Love the way reincarnation, history, social evolution of humanity, human darkness and an alien are all weaved together. These are individually heavy concepts but the way the writer(s) have weaved them effortlessly and kept the characters very fragile, very human is astounding. It is simply high quality writing. And I love the portrayal by the actors. Both of them are so \u201cnatural\u201d and in the skin of their characters\u2026I cannot imagine how creatively rewarding this entire series must be for all of them.Good Doctor - This series blew my mind on how a special needs person who is a genius at medicine yet lacks basic social skills even struggles to get accepted and qualified as a doctor. The first episode itself is so riveting and intense that it hooks you straight on. Again the characters are so well etched out. Bringing out the aspect of the man who opposes the main character and how his opposition actually is a blessing is the way life itself works and I was humbled by how it is brought about so subtly and cleanly.Ex-Girlfriends Club - Though story-wise there isn\u2019t too much happening, but what I liked is that the main character of a man with many ex-girlfriends who are not ready to leave him, is shown very well. There is a human side to a man who tries to be a \u201crescuer\u201d to these women who seek their identity through him and not ready to let him go.So far so good :) ",

There's a major mack story, which focuses on Eun Dae Gu (I think that's his name), and his traumatic past. It's super goodI can hear your voice - again it's a crime one, but it's more about lawyers than detectives. There's a character played my Lee Jong Suk, and he can read people's thoughts. He helps the lawyers win their cases and at the same time, put the man who murdered his dad, back into prisonMoorim school - this one is about 2 young boys who go to this elite martial arts school. Hongbin from the kpop group Vixx, plays an heir to a chinese business and becomes friends with a kpop idol who has chi power (he basically has cool powers)Blood - blood is about a top surgeon who is also secretly a vampire. He finds out more about himself, and how to control his thirst for blood. At the same time, there's this sort of war between good vampires and bad vampires. The show features a roller-coaster of emotions so prepare yourselfThe great doctor - this one a little repetitive but it's enjoyable nonetheless. It's set in the Goryeo dynasty, and is about a female doctor from present time, who gets dragged into the dynasty to save a dying queen. There she meets a famous, strong general (played by Lee Min Ho) and falls in love. Time is tough for her however, as the people believe that she is a doctor sent from \u201cheaven\u201d. Many people try to take her but she just wants to go back to present timeThese are my top 5. Please watch. They're fabulous ",

            "answer_text": "I can't believe no one has mentioned Playful/Mischevious kiss!   It's not the best, I agree. It's sweet and very relaxing. If you're a regular girl/gay guy, I guarantee you'll love it(Did I lose the straight guy demographic there?). I always say, watch the pilot and a couple more episodes; it's a very small investment. Give playful kiss a try. It's very popular, yes, unrealistic, but if you want hard-hitting facts you might as well watch a documentary.  The story goes like this. A handsome guy with high IQ is loved by a girl with moderate looks and grades. She's innocent (mostly stupid, but so adorably stupid, I see why one wouldn't want to watch that, I don't judge people who watch reality tv, besides, this is much better, I swear). The show focuses on how her love blossoms and how things go for her. I don't want to give too much away.  After reading this answer, if you went on Viki.com and watched atleast two episodes of Playful kiss you would've really added a few smiles to your life. Just try it, okay? If high school romances are a no-no for you, I suggest watching My love from the star.   It's about a human-looking alien who lives on earth for 400 years waiting for his next trip back home and 3 months before his departure falls in love with a human woman. There's alot of story here. Not alot of over the top melodrama. You'll thank me :) ",

            "answer_text": "Look at your description and not being a fan of popular high school dramas like Boys over Flowers, Dream High and School 2013, also suggests that your interests lean more towards that genre and you prefer high-shool, campus sort of rom-coms over action and thrillers. As some of the previous answers have already mentioned, my best pick for you would be Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo. It is a fun rom-com in a campus setting with only 16 episodes. There are no rich guy-poor girl romancing, but more of a real life feel. The chemistry between the two leads are so real, that the couple is dating in real life as well.  My next pick for you is Moonlights Drawn Clouds. It has a historical setting, but not the typical rigid, boring sageuk drama. This also a fun rom-com with an adorable young couple. It also has cross dressing which makes it more interesting. With 18 episodes.  Sungkyunkwan Scandal is another similar drama where the main female lead cross dresses. The setting is in the historical Sungkyunkwan Educational Institutes for boys that belong to the elite. This is also an interesting historical romantic comedy. Worth the watch for 20 episodes.

If at all anything is close to the romantic scenes of K2H2, DDLJ, Veer Zaara, it is a Korean love series. It takes you back to that era of good movies( though illogical;)). Below are my few favourites and they have been ranked in the same order. Oh my Venus \u2014 One of the cutest series I have watched in the recent times. Smooth effortless acting of the stars. Not a great but an engaging plotline. If you haven't watched any Korean series till date, pls start with this.Crash Landing on You \u2014 Excellent plot series which engages you till the very end. Super handsome and beautiful characters. You will get to know the two sides of Korea \u2014 South and North.Something in the Rain \u2014 A very mature series. Korean culture when it comes to marriage is very similar to Indian culture. You will go through a lot of ups and downs during the series and can compare the harassment one has to go through a conservative set up when it comes to involvement of parents in their child's life even after they being independent and in their thirties.Doctor Stranger \u2014 A very different and confusing yet very engaging and thriller series. Super handsome actor. None of this is possible in the real world yet you will be glued to this one till the very end.One Spring Night \u2014 Again a very mature series. Though it becomes slow at times but then I loved the way the writer has done characterisation of the main lead actress. She has been shown mentally very strong and I loved the way she handles her hurdles without losing her calm.I have watched many many more series but penned down the top 5 for me till now. Any more recommendations required, do let me know:) Would be happy to help ",

That's why it's called drama, I guess. There are k dramas which are deep or gives you a reality check, it depends on the drama you watch.  Some of my favourite dramas are Goblin, Scarlet Heart Ryeo: Moon lovers, Tunnel, Itewon Class,Descendents of the sun, Weightlifting fairy Kim Bok Joo and the list goes on. They are really creative and pretty addictive I can say. Ciao. ",

As I know those languages. When I returned to India, I missed watching it with her more than anything. And suddenly remembered some of my friends talking highly of \u201cwinter sonata\u201d - during my stay in Malaysia for about a decade. So I casually searched for Korean dramas and \u201cEmpress Ki\u201d looked interesting. Thus began my Korean drama addiction. It seems unstoppable now. Empress Ki - OMG it was so good. Words are not enough to describe, but frankly I didn\u2019t notice Ji Chang-wook so much there. On the whole it was fantastic.Moon embracing the sun.- it was interesting and fast, and now I wanted more of history and period dramas.Saimdang - this took me one level higher and I began learning about history and about the currency printed with her photo and even tried to paint like her- didn\u2019t succeed ofcourse.Suspicious partner - I became a huge huge fan of Ji Chang- wook. He is so good. His smile and the way he occupies the screen is awesome.Healer - was fantastic. Superb.The K2 - again with JCW. Now a big fan and keep looking for more of his dramas.More to come\u2026 ",

First up, we have Descendants of the Kim, which was a smash hit when it came out in North Korea and features everyone\u2019s favourite father and son, Kim Jong-Il and Kim Jong Un!!!  Next, we have My Comrade from the North, which like our nuclear program and ICBMs, were made with help from China.  And last but not least, give it up for GAME OF KIMS!!!!! This TV show has had a 9001% rating for every season that has been released, however some Western bourgeoisie scum accuse our great TV show of having sex scenes.   And there you have it. The best Korean TV drama series, in my opinion. P.S. In my opinion While You Were Sleeping and Descendants of the Sun are among the best.

Im very fond of Sherlock Holmes (especially the one portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch) so I relished watching this. It's unpredictable. I didn't like it at first but as the story unfolds itself, I started to like it. When I was watching this, I was so obsessed with this that when my parents told me to sleep, i sneakily got my mother\u2019s phone and used all her data just for me to be able to watch it and hid under a ton of blankets and pillows. Though i didn\u2019t like the ending that much. Definitely 9/10.  Suspicious Partner I laughed so hard at the first episodes and its so cutee. Kinda clich\u00e9 but i still recommend this! 8.5/10  Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo One of the most overrated kdramas of all time here in the Philippines. It\u2019s worth the binge watch because the couple are so adorable! Kim Bok Joo ain\u2019t your typical girl :)) 9/10  Oh My Venus Oh yess!!! I love love love this. For all those people who are trying find motivation to lose weight or achieve their goals, watch Kang Joo- Eun. This drama makes me kiliggg (giddy / makes me have butterflies in my stomach) 8.9/10 ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the answer request User-11309324426999237415. I will try to recommend some dramas that have not being mentioned mostly in other answers, but totally worth to watch. Pinocchio (2015) starring Lee Jong Suk and Park Shin Hye. This is a romantic comedy that has a journalism polt which makes it interesting. Plus the bond between the main couple is excellent which makes them one of the best loved pairs. 2. If you prefer medical dramas such as Doctor Crush, I suggest you to watch Yong-Pal (2015) starring Joo Won and Kim Tae Hee. You will find a rich girl-poor guy drama with sort of thriller aspect as the romance develops.  3. I am surprised to see no one has mentioned the 2016 mega hit Descendant of the Sun starring Song Hye Kyo and Song Joong Ki. It is indeed a beautiful romance between a doctor and an Army Captain. A must watch. You will get a movie feel.  4. I\u2019ll also suggest one of the currently airing dramas Chicago Typewriter staring Yoo Ah In, Im Soo Jun and Hp Kyung Pyo. If you into reading and writing this will be a perfect fit, that shares story of writer and his previous life in 1930s. The cinematography is very impressive as well.  5. Finally, I can\u2019t help but mention one of the best romantic comedies of all time Weight Lifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo starring Lee Sung Kyun and Nam Joo Hyuk. A romance in a sports university between a national weightlifter and a swimmer.  ",

But in my opinion, the most popular are not always the best ones! Here\u2019s my favorites: Reply series (Reply 1997, Reply 1994, and Reply 1988. I highly recommend all of them but for a new Kdrama fan, I think Reply 1988 (2015) will be the best one, it\u2019s very heartwarming)Misaeng: Incomplete Life (2014) A lot of great quotes about life and very realistic. I love rewatching itSignal (2016) Best time travelling K-drama everrr.Coffee Prince (2008) This is one of the dramas that contributes in Hallyu wave (altho not that big) which means it has that typical Korean drama vibes, but this one is definitely one of my fav.Another Oh Hae Young (2016) one of the best romantic comedy in Kdrama. I really love the female lead, great acting and very relatable character for women I guess.Here\u2019s more that worth mentioning: Goong (2006),Goblin (2016), Healer (2014),Fight For My Way (2017), Discovery Of Romance (2014), I can't think of anything else at the moment, I hope you do watch from my list because they\u2019re really good.

At the first mostly I prefer the romance comedy as I'm new to Kdramas so don't know about marvellous categories of Korean Serials\u2026 But after some time mostly I prefer other dramas related to detective and law like Judge vs Judge and Defendent and many more beautiful dramas in which actor perform very well and you don't even realise that all this is just in air. And yeah as If someone knows korea and knows about their history. So I want to add that I really love the historical dramas of Korea.

It is head and shoulders above any other drama I've had the chance to follow under many an aspect: Photography-wiseSoundtrack-wiseDialogue-wiseEmotion-wiseActing-wise (just go through the names casted and it will be no surprise once you start watching) As per creativity and original plot, I do believe both this and W - Two Worlds are to be mentioned first and there is an on-going battle for the title, as both are genius with no bloomers (or bloopers, depending on your area) nor inaccuracies. The actress for the female lead (Han Hyo-Joo) and the actor playing her father (Kim Eui-Sung) are simply top-notch.  Cinematographically speaking, Beautiful World is work-of-art impressive, and both the acting and the way the plot develops are impeccable. For reference, this is my personal second to favourite right after the first I've mentioned, as genius and mind-blowing as the afore-mentioned W may be. Cho Yeo-Jeong (in the picture below) is in this as one of the most important characters, so you probably know what level of good acting to expect.  ",

Ofcourse boys over flowers is always there in the list but you can also watch the Japanese version of this \"hana yori dango\" for it has detailed emotion but if you prefer k-drama only then go ahead   5. heart strings is another romantic story that you can opt for.

Here are my suggestions for dramas light on the romance: White Christmas (2011)  An 8-episode, thriller/suspense drama which asks the question: Are monsters born or made? There\u2019s mystery, murder and an introspection on motives and what makes people do what they do. Signal (2016)  A detective enlists the help of a profiler from the future in order to solve prevent crimes. One of the highest rating cable shows ever, this one\u2019s very well paced, intelligently written and interestingly shot. Jealousy Incarnate (2016)  Now, I know you said no romanc-ey kdramas, but hear me out. This one\u2019s not your ordinary romcom. While the premise is a look into how jealousy turns into love, this 24-episode drama tackles other issues such as cancer, friendship and office politics in a quirky, fun and thoughtful fashion. With the writing great and the direction chockful of symbolisms, this one\u2019s a must watch. Enjoy! ",

The Casts are Park Seo-joon , Go-Ara, Park Hyung Sik, Choi min ho. ( Not mentioning all the casts ) It is a periodic drama set in the Kingdom of Silla. The story is about a group of elite, handsome and charming men who joins together to form a community called \u201cHwarang\u201d. The main focus of this elite group is to develop unity and respect for each other and to fight against the 'bone rank system'. The bone rank system was considered to be the reason why common men in the country couldn't live a peaceful life. And Hwarang is said to be considered as the future of Silla. Another beautiful part is the bromance between park Seo-joon and Park Hyung Sik. Another cute bromance is seen between Choi min ho - do ji han. It is a beautiful story and the drama is a visual treat too. ",

Technology has really improved\u2026 Legend of the Blue Sea (scenes filmed in Spain, and because the female lead\u2019s a mermaid, you get a lot of scenes under the ocean..  and because there are historical scenes, you get lots of lovely nature scenes. Beautiful camerawork. Just beautiful!)  Descendants of the Sun (just look at this scenery! Filmed in Greece.)   Goblin (has scenes in Quebec- maybe not as stunning as Greece or Spain, but still gorgeous in its own right. And awesome camerawork/CGI due to superpowers of the goblin and the grim reaper xD)   I also think Queen Inhyun\u2019s Man was very beautiful- not quite as modern, yet it was just a very beautiful drama.  W-Two Worlds (technically it\u2019s all Seoul, but the camerawork/CGI is impressive. Also, he\u2019s a webtoon character, and the webtoon art is great xD)  ",

Kim Shin becomes Dokkaebi (Goblin), possessing an immortal life. At first he thinks that he is blessed, but he realizes that he is cursed. Closer to the present day, Kim Shin has waited 900 years for a human bride to end his immortal life. One night, he saves a dying pregnant woman (Park Hee-Von) who is destined to die. Meanwhile, the Grim Reaper (Lee Dong-Wook) is unable to find the dead pregnant woman. The woman gives birth to a baby girl named Ji Eun-Tak (later played by Kim Go-Eun). 9 years later, Ji Eun-Tak lives with her mother and is able to see ghosts. One night, her mother suddenly dies. On that night, she meets the Grim Reaper. In the present day, Ji Eun-Tak is a high school student. She still sees ghosts and hears their whisper of \u201cDokkaebi\u2019s bride.\u201d She now lives with her aunt\u2019s family, but she is mistreated by them. On her birthday, Ji Eun-Tak sits by the sea with a lighted birthday cake. At that time, Kim Shin suddenly appears in front of her. Kim Shin does not know why, but he can hear her voice and appears in front of her against his will. Coincidentally, Kim Shin lives with the Grim Reaper at the same house. Now, Kim Shin appears in front of her against his will, whenever she turns off the lights. One day, Ji Eun-Tak tells him that he is Dokkaebi and she is his bride. ",

Another successful one like it is \u201cSuspicious Partner\u201d, which is even cuter because the two leads are actually together irl! And for ur fix of \u201cFlower boys\u201d (has all the current fave actors in it) I recommend Hwarang, a historical drama/romance. ",

However, there is one particular drama that far exceeded my expectations. Nara\u2019s Rain (\ube44\uc758 \ub098\ub77c)  It\u2019s sweet, not over-the-top like other dramas, and very well written. The cinematography and pacing are also on-point - you would probably still understand the story without any dialogue. It\u2019s just beautiful. I\u2019m not crazy about Korean romance dramas either, but I was pleased to find that this wasn\u2019t one of them. I highly recommend it. Here\u2019s the whole movie (provided by KBS with subtitles).  ",

I think its written perfectly and some dialogues of the scheduler leave you thinking. 2)Goong aka Princess Hours  To start with i am a big Yoon Eun Hye fan, so the star cast and the storyline which involves Princes, palace, and royalty made it a must watch for me.There were many instances where u actually laugh out loud, it has the regular square love story (i named it so because 4 characters are involved), but the sets, actors, light moments make it a good watch. 3)City Hunter  Its LEE MIN HO, and there is mind-blowing action, and cute romance, Lots of sentiment, a dash of comedy,twists and turns in the plot and whole lot of style.There you go,Complete Entertainer.

Strong Woman Do Bong Soon  The only thing I can say is, if you haven't watched this, trust me you are missing the best show of your life. 2. School2015  I loved the storyline of this drama. Also Kim So Hyun's acting in it is exceptionally good. 3. Noble, My Love  It's a web series. I must say, it's the best web series I've seen so far. 4. The K2  This show is related to politics to a great extent. But damn! Ji Chang Wook, in a black suit, as a bodyguard defines \u2018perfection\u2019. 5 Bride Of The Century  According to me, this show quite underrated. I never heard about this show and was quite amazed after finishing it. I always prefer shows where the leads look forward to marriage rather than just dating. So all more reasons to find it appealing. Edit: One must really watch Weight Lifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo. It\u2019s of the best drama I've seen so far. Tbh I never planned to watch this show cause well I thought it might not reach my expectations but boy was I wrong? It was far beyond my expectations. ",

What they feel. The list is on going what they can make you feel and understand. I personally connect with them so much and i feel you will too. So, what are you waiting for.

Plus, hot alien! Goblin- This was a masterpiece, not only in terms of story and plot but also the cinematography and music! It's also in the fantasy genre like the previous drama and does it complete justice. Decendents of the Sun- The plot and the romance were so well intertwined that nothing ever seemed forced. Totally recommended! Oh My Venus- This was a simple romantic comedy K-Drama and Shin Min Ah is a delight to watch! It's okay, that's love- This drama is a slightly more thought provoking drama but just as entertaining. The psychological aspect never seemed too intense and gave just the right amount of feels. Watch this for the chemistry between the leads and the beautiful way mental health is showcased. ",

The story as a whole is covered in sixteen some episodes , what I liked about this drama is the transformation of Do Bong Soon ..she indeed has immense physical strength but throughout the series she also goes to being strong willed as well. Also , the chemistry between lead pairs doesn't seem made up .. though a bit cheesy at times but it adds up quite naturally to the flow :) 2) Faith /The Great Doctor  This drama is about a modern-day plastic surgeon (Kim Hee-sun in picture ) who is kidnapped and travels back in time to the Goreyo period, 700 years in the past . If I were to pick one Lee Min Ho's drama , unarguably it would be this one. Picture credits: From Google ",

The biggest positives of watching a Korean drama is that they will teach you values and manners which only your parents or someone elder can teach. All the Korean dramas are good though, but here are my favourites: Descendants of the sun (all- time favourite <3 )Scarlet Heart Ryeo: Moon Lovers ( Incarnation concept )High society ( I have learned a lot of good things from this drama)Five Enough ( Teaches a lot of things about families)Jugglers ( A fun drama to watch)",

Conflict ensues after Ka Suo reluctantly ascends to the throne as his lover, Li Luo, and his brother go missing. Ka Suo also accidentally discovers an evil presence lurking in the Ice Tribe's holy shrine. He and his companions enter the mysterious shrine, and defeat head of the shrine, Lady Yuan Ji, only to find out that she has been plotting a conspiracy against him. Ka Suo also experiences hardships in trying to find his lover and brother, not knowing that his brother has lost all of his memories and has become the Fire Prince under his mother's command. A war between the two tribes commences once again, with the two brothers pitted against each other. ",
