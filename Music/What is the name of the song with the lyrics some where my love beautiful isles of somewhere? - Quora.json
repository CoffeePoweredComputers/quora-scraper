            "answer_text": "I wonder if you have two song lyrics mixed up with each other. There is a song called \u201cSomewhere, My Love\u201d that was based on the main theme song in the movie Dr. Zhivago (\u201cLara\u2019s Theme\u201d), and there is a hymn called \u201cBeautiful Isle of Somewhere.\u201d I\u2019m not aware of any song with all those lyrics together, but you could always write a new one! \u201cSomewhere, My Love (Lara\u2019s Theme)\u201d  \u201cBeautiful Isle of Somewhere\u201d  ",
