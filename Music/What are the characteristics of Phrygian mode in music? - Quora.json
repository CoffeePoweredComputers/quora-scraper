            "answer_text": "Locrian and Phrygyan modes have triad B-D-F accordingly in most importaht tonic chord. and in second in importance dominant chord. It is remarkable that Locrean mode is considered as almost unusable in music and Phrygian one as most dark. There is interesting article \" Everything You Need to Know About Phrygian\"( see \"< https://arthurfoxmusic.com/phrygian-mode/) It says about > \"THE INNER GRAVITY OF PHRYGIAN \" and its darkness. How is it possible to explain? Triad B-D-F is very dissonant. In order to avoid unpleasant sound it it is possible to weaken either note B or note F. Nevertheless chord notes have function to support melody and therefore the melody's change to accordingly notes would be less supported. Besides fifth of note B is note F# which is absent in natural diatonic scales and therefore the melody's leap from note B on fifth interval isn't supported. If note B would be weakened then : -by Locrean mode tonic triad's B note wouldn't support tonic B melody notes what is undesired; -by Phrygian mode dominant triad's B note wouldn't support dominant B melody notes what is undesired as well. If note F would be weakened then : -by Phrygian mode melody's notes in interval from D up to G wouldn't be supported and by it note A would be supported thank to its fifth distance from triad's note D; -by Locrian mode melody's notes in the bigger interval from D up to A wouldn't be supported because of absence in it of note on fifth interval from note D what's even worse. In the case of Phrgian mode music practice got a way out by using of deep dissonant bass line which can provide music's smoothness by gaps in the melody what, however, is suitable for dark music. ",

            "answer_text": "The Phrygian mode is a natural minor scale with a flatted second degree. In the modern diatonic system it is the third mode of the major scale. It was one of the 8 modes from the system used in Gregorian chant, where it always went E F G A B C D E (there were no keys in those days).  It\u2019s also common in folk music from the Mediterranean and the Middle East, so it tends to sound \u201ceastern\u201d to western ears, listen to the beginning of this for example:  In modern pop and electronic music, particularly hip hop, trap, dubstep, techno, grime and bassline/bass house, it\u2019s used ubiquitously to create a slightly threatening and unnerving \u201cgangsta\u201d feel.   In all of the above examples the flat second leads down to the tonic, rather than the more usual natural seventh leading up. The \u201cthreatening\u201d feel in electronic music and hip hop is quite often achieved by emphasising the tritone between the fifth and the flat second. In folk and electronic music (but not in chant), the third degree can be raised by a semitone - this creates the fifth mode of harmonic minor, sometimes called \u201cphrygian dominant\u201d and can create an ambiguous tonic chord (major or minor) or an even more eastern feel by emphasising the augmented second between the flat second degree and the major third. Folk song example (thanks to Ethan Hein - found this on your blog!)  And an electronic one:  The triads you get from each degree of the Phrygian mode are minor on the 1st, 4th and 7th degrees, major on the 2nd, 3rd and 6th degrees, and diminished on the 5th degree. If you raise the 3rd to a major third, then you get major triads on the 1st and 2nd degrees, minor triads on the 4th and 7th degrees, diminished triads on the 3rd and 5th degrees and an augmented triad on the 6th degree.  Chord progressions in Phrygian seldom stray far from the tonic, usually involving the bII chord (often with the I in the bass, creating bIIMaj7), the bvii7 chord and the iv / iv7 chord. The iv chord with or without the seventh can resolve to the i chord in a plagal cadence, but an upward and inward resolution from the bvii7 is probably more usual. As the v chord is diminished, making a perfect cadence is difficult without borrowing a V7 chord from the parallel Ionian.  ",
