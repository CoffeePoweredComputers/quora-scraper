            "answer_text": "When I first read this question, I wasn\u2019t even going to bother to answer it because I was so sure someone would have already nominated the girl I had in mind. Helen Shapiro. Right from when she started recording at about the age of fourteen, she sang with a voice that was so deep, a lot of radio listeners at the time thought they were listening to someone called Allen Shapiro! She had a string of hit records in the early 60\u2019s and once toured the UK with the Beatles booked as a support act. Unfortunately, her career was over run by the bands of the emerging Beat Boom and she went back to her first musical love - jazz.  ",

            "answer_text": "Well, nobody's mentioned Nina Hagen yet. In case you are unfamiliar with her, she is a German singer and actress who has been active since the 1970's. She is best known for her highly excentric blend of punk rock and opera, although she is definitely not limited to this rather unique style. The following youtube video demonstrates Nina Hagen's Vocal Range over her career, which it claims to be G#1 through B7.  Even in the early 80's she could produce some amazingly low tones--try \"Born In Xixax\" or \"Smack Jack\" off the \"Nunsexmonkrock\" album. But her main singing voice (she has so many) in the later part of her career has definitely dropped in pitch to fully qualify her as having a deep voice--try \"Personal Jesus\" off the album by the same name, or \"Seemann\" from the \"In My World\" album, or \"Serenade In Blue\" from \"Irgendwo Auf Der Welt\".
