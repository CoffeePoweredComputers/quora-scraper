            "answer_text": "As earlier answers suggest the top few percent make big money. The rest of us I would suggest are experiencing and industry where wages are going down or remaining static. There are a few reasons for this. In the good old days, 20 years ago, I was paid an hourly rate, the amount isn\u2019t important\u2026 but it was good money by today\u2019s standards. Dj\u2019s were pretty rare and Vynil records cost a lot of money to buy, a12\u2033 inch import could set you back as much as \u00a310 even as long as 20 years ago. So there was a small pool of people actually djing. Most who broke into clubs were pretty good but the raw material eg records were expensive therefore wages were pretty good. Fast forward to the 21st Century and the cost of music has come down considerably. Assuming you pay for your music as little a 99 pence a track. Big difference from \u00a310! The other problem is digital djing. I don\u2019t knock it I use it myself\u2026 it\u2019s far easier to carry a pen drive with music than record bags\u2026. The problem in a nutshell is you can learn to Dj in 5 minutes with software or the sync button. This ease of learning doesn\u2019t filter out the ones who are not very good\u2026 in the days of Vynil it took months if not years before you could play in a club or bar and by process of natural selection people who weren\u2019t very good fell by the wayside. So as a consequence, the not very good. In an attempt to get a paying gig will often offer to work for free or play in return for drinks. Which in turn is preventing the dj\u2019s who are good from earning a living wage. In central London right now\u2026 if you were starting out as a new Dj you would be lucky if you received \u00a3100 for a 7hour set. At the turn of the century a 6 hour set would pay you anything from \u00a3120 to \u00a3250. There is no DJ union that I know of so this is a position that is unlikely to change. Wannabes are destroying the industry. I consider it a privilege to play in any venue, the fact I\u2019m paid to do it is a bonus, I\u2019m lucky in that I have a full time job that pays well\u2026 however, when you look at the cost of transport, parking, food and purchasing equipment and music. There really isn\u2019t much left from the money that we are paid. We can stop this. Stop illegal downloads of music. Stop playing for free or offering to play for drinks\u2026 even you want to be dj\u2019s\u2026 just don\u2019t do it. If your going to be in the industry earn your right to be here like all of us had to. We formed a union or organisation that campaigned for better conditions. Trust me 6 hours on your feet with no toilet fag or food Break is not for everyone. I will get off my soap box now ",

            "answer_text": "Wait, what? Which DJs are you talking about here? The top 0,0001%? Yes, they make money, and it is no different from any other entertainer, they fill up venues and generate revenues for producers and promoters. Why shouldn't they get big bucks? But this question is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay off considering the activity of DJing as a whole (even if you consider only professional DJs). I personally know about 100 DJs (about half of them really good) who cannot even makes end meet, and all of them have other jobs to support themselves. It is very very very common for DJs not getting paid at all to play at parties or festivals. I suggest you change your question because it is assuming something incredibly false. ",
