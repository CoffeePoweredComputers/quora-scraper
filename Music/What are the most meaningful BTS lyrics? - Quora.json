            "answer_text": "My favorites at the moment are the lyrics of Spring Day, Mikrokosmos, Fake Love, Lights, Not Today, Epiphany, BST, and DOPE. Spring Day - Friendship That\u2019s Growing Apart Over Time (and my go-to sad song haha) Spring Day effectively conveyed the feeling of pain of a friendship growing apart and the longingness to be together again. I always feel a slight tug in my heart whenever I watch the MV. This is truly the queen of BTs songs. What struck me the most was Yoongi's parts: \u201cIs it you who changed (Is it you who changed)Or is it me (Or is it me)?I hate this moment, this time flowing byWe are changed you knowJust like everyone you know\u201d \u201cYes I hate you, you left meBut I never stopped thinking about you, not even a dayHonestly, I miss you, but I\u2019ll erase you'Cause it hurts less than to blame you\u201d  Mikrokosmos and Light - Belongingness and Expressing Yourself I personally like these songs because it makes you feel \u201caccepted\u201d and \u201cincluded\u201d especially when you feel like just an \u201cinsignificant\u201d and \u201cunworthy\u201d member of the society. Or when you just feel \u201calone\u201d/\u201dlonely\u201d. Also, Lights also added the message of acknowledging your existence and expressing your true self. In Mikrokosmos, these are my favorite lines: \u201cOne light is ambitionSome light is rebellionPeople's lightsAll are preciousThis dark night (Don't be lonely)Like stars (We shine)Don't disappear\n'Cause you're a big existenceLet us shine\u201d And in Lights: \u201cBut it's okay sometimesTo show weaknessIt's okay to be youDon't lie to yourself anymore\u201d  Fake Love - Superficial Love and Losing Your True Self in the Process Honestly, I\u2019m not quite a fan of this song, but I can\u2019t ignore the lyrics. The whole song is perfectly written and you can feel the emotions in each line. It\u2019s very relevant now especially in people who always try to hide their \u201cunacceptable\u201d part of themselves to fit the ideal mold of what a lover should be. My favorite part would be: \u201cI wanna be a good man, just for you\nI gave the world, just for you\nI changed everything, just for you\nBut I don't know me, Who are you?The forest just for us, you weren\u2019t there\nThe route I took, I forgotI even became quite unsure of who I wasTry babbling into the mirror, who the hell are you?\u201d  Not Today - Anthem of Society\u2019s Underdogs This song is a motivational song for those who feel like the society\u2019s being unfair to them, or those who are ridiculed, judged, and did not fit society\u2019s standards. Not my favorite beats, but the lyrics are so good and will make you feel empowered. My favorite lines would be: \u201cIf you can\u2019t fly, then runToday we will surviveIf you can\u2019t run, then walkToday we will surviveIf you can\u2019t walk, then crawlEven if you have to crawl, gear upAim your gun! Ready! Fire!\u201d  Epiphany - Realization to Love Yourself First Jin\u2019s solo song has a very special place in my heart, because the message of the song is so meaningful. In a relationship, you try to be the best version of yourself all the time, to the point that you have to put on some masks (like in Fake Love) to achieve acceptance from others, which creates an internal conflict with yourself. As the title suggests, Epiphany is a song about the realization that one should accept their own self first - flaws and all - and that realizing the beauty of it. It\u2019s only when you start to love yourself you begin to genuinely love others. My favorite lines would be: \u201cI\u2019m shaking and afraid but I keep going forwardI\u2019m meeting the real you, hidden in the stormWhy did I want to hide my precious self like this?What was I so afraid of?Why did I hide my true self? I\u2019m the one I should love in this worldShining me, precious soul of mineI finally realized so I love meNot so perfect but so beautifulI'm the one I should love\u201d  Blood, Sweat, and Tears - Temptations and Intense Desires There\u2019s a whole video analyzing this song + MV + literary references like Demian; The dark elegant concept of the MV + lyrics + musical arrangement makes this song the most superior song of BTS in my opinion. Truly the KING. You can actually interpret this song in many ways, but basically it\u2019s about your deepest and darkest desires and your quest to do what it takes to either resist or failing to resist and want more. (It could be love, forbidden love, fame, success, money, you name it). the MV is another level though, it\u2019s about dealing with the bad and good side of yourself (the analysis is a must watch!) As for BTS, it may be their craving to be acknowledged, known, and be accepted. They work 500% in everything they do and I admire them for that. The DOPE song is also a raw message by BTS to their judgers and how they work their asses off to achieve their dreams. In BST, almost the whole song is my favorite, but I\u2019ll put some lines as well: \u201cKiss me on the lipsA secret just between the two of usDeeply poisoned by the jail of youI cannot worship anyone but you and I knewThe grail was poisoned but I drank it anyway My blood, sweat, and tearsMy cold breath tooTake it all away I want it more, more, more, moreI want it more, more, more, more, more\u201d    Okay I\u2019m really sleepy. I guess that\u2019s all, goodnight. ",
