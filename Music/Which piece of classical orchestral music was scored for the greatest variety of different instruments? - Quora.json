            "answer_text": "There are all kinds of weird pieces out there that call for thousands of performers. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever find the record holder. What orchestral piece demands the largest number of musicians? In terms of mainstream repertoire, you would have to look at a modern work that uses a huge percussion section, since that would allow for the greatest variety of individual instruments. Turangal\u00eela-Symphonie - Wikipedia The Rite of Spring - Wikipedia Turangalila slightly beats out Rite of Spring in terms of variety. Here\u2019s a piece by the film composer Alex North, which is even huger: Film Music CD Reviews- March 2001 3 Fl (doubling picc, alto fl, bass fl) 3 Ob (doubling eng horn, baritone oboe or heckelphone) 3 Cl (doubling Eb cl, A cl,bass cl contrabass cl) 3 Bsn (doubling contrabass) 4 Horns 4 Trumpets 4 Trombones 1 Baritone Horn 1 Tuba 1 Harp Keyboards (piano, celesta, harpsichord, tack piano) Timpani (10 kettedrums) Xylophone, glockenspiel, vibraphone, marimba, snare,cymbals, bass drum, tambourine Gourd, maracas, conga, 6 tunable toms, 2 steel drums,  Chromatic series of cowbells, crotales, lou-jons, boo-bams, log drums Not exactly part of the mainstream repertoire, though. If you keep searching, you\u2019ll always find something bigger. ",

            "answer_text": "My initial response was to suggest Ravel\u2019s Bolero as it adds Eb clarinet, Soprano & Tenor Saxes & Celeste to the \u2018standard\u2019 orchestra. Then I thought of some of Mahler\u2019s & Bruckner\u2019 symphonies as well as some extreme avante garde material such as Poulenc and had to suggest doing some Google research on the scores of these others. Vaughan Williams, for example, used a wind machine in his wonderful 7th Symphony! Good hunting. ",
