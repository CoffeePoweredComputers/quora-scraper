            "answer_text": "Well, this is almost a misnomer, as most rock songs considered \u201cClassic\u201d are usually very popular so underrated, hmmm.. If we look at \u201cClassic Rock\u201d albums there are some songs that are sometimes overlooked. Simon & Garfunkel - \u201cSong For the Asking\u201d from the Bridge Over Troubled Water LP ( 1970) Beautiful!  Deep Purple\u2019s \u201cBloodsucker\u201d from In Rock ( 1970), a seminal metal track with a great riff! Killer!  YES- \u201cA Venture\u201d - Overlooked track with a great and unique groove. sitting in between \u201cI\u2019ve Seen All Good People\u201d and \u201cPerpetual Change\u201d on The Yes Album This is an extended version - Chris Squier\u2019s bass has never sounded stronger.  Jethro Tull\u2019s Aqualung LP (1971) had a few tracks played yo death, but if you had the album there are two little ditties that are really lovely little segue ways. \u201cWondering Aloud\u201d  \u201cSlipstream\u201d  David Bowie\u2019s Ziggy Stardust ( 1972) album\u2019s deep tracks are great. The one that stands out for me is \u201cStar\u201d ,which is his take on how things may turn out for him should he become one. Interesting lyrics and very catchy!  On Rush\u2019s 2112 ( 1976) , there are a couple of nice songs on side two, \u201c A Passage To Bankok\u201d, and \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d. \u201cA Passage To Bangkok\u201d, Live 1978  \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d Studio Version.  The Clash\u2019s- London Calling LP has so many great songs ad covers so many bases, that some of the tracks seem a bit underplayed/ overlooked. I particularly the dark humor of \u201cThe Right Profile\u201d which comments on actor Montgomery Clift\u2019s misfortunes in a bad car accident. The horn section is particularly good, as the lyric always comes back to \u201cHe sure looks funny\u201d and then \u201c It\u2019s NOT funny\u201d - \u201cThat\u2019s Mongomery Clift honey!\u201d The other track is called \u201cKoka Kola\u201d, another humorous take on the prevalence of cocaine and doesn\u2019t condone nor condemn it\u2019s use, which is the brilliance of the song. Great! Monty:  Koka Kola - Live at the US Festival., 1983. Killer!  ",

            "answer_text": "Several by standout artists: Cowboy Song by Thin Lizzy: On an album that included the much played Boys Are Back in Town and Jailbreak.  My Babe by Foghat: Overshadowed by Slow Ride and Fool for the City.  Nobody\u2019s Fault by Aerosmith: On the album Rocks, which is considered by some to be the finest hard rock album of all time.  And while we are on Aerosmith.. Lord of the Thighs by Aerosmith: Get Your Wings may be their most underrated album, and this may be the best song on that album.  Skateaway by Dire Straits : I could easily be convinced to include Tunnel of Love here too, but a vastly underrated Dire Straits album.  Celebration Day by Led Zeppelin: Led Zeppelin III is an undervalued album, and this song is the most underrated, although it was frequently played on tour. I especially like the way it segues from the previous track, Friends.  Brighton Rock by Queen: Sometimes dismissed as only a vehicle to showcase Brian May\u2019s guitar playing, which it is, but it is also so much more.  I could probably come up with a few dozen more, but this is a decent start\u2026 ",
