            "answer_text": "Isn\u2019t night life usually for adults? The usual number of bars, restaurants, etc. Compared to NYC, Tokyo\u2019s live music scene is more expensive, generally with some good music available, but you have to pay for it, with some shows wanting to include dinner for 4000\u201310,000 Yen. There are also movie theaters, though they are a bit expensive, though discounts for students, women, and couples are sometimes available. Depending on your budget, nights out can be relatively cheap or really expensive if you prefer 5 star hotel bars or bars in the ritzier areas in town. Be careful as some bars and restaurants still include otoshi charges (sometimes labled as table/snack charges) where restaurants give you a small expensive snack to help the restaurant or bar make more money. That and higher end places will also tack on a 10\u201315% service charge in addition to the current 10% sales tax. ",
