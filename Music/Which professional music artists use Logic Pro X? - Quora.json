            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know exactly everyone person but I can say for sure that J cole does. I would also say that most professional music artists who use Logic will be those who produce music, make beats, and write songs. This is because Logic is a superb tool for quickly sketching music ideas on the fly and turning them into finished records with ease. I would say the majority of music professionals that use DAWs to create music, use Logic pro at some point in the arensal of production tools and its almost a given if their are running Mac. Pro tools is still considered the standard here in the U.S. but not abroad. ",

            "answer_text": "I used to be based out of a large and prestigious studio complex in London comprising around 70+ project studios; the majority of the occupants were/are top engineers/producers/writers/artists. I won\u2019t name names out of professional courtesy, but Logic is definitely the DAW of choice these days for artists/producers particularly in the \u2018Top 40\u2019 pop sector. Pro Tools tends to be favoured more heavily by creatives whose roles are more technical; for instance editors, mixers and mastering engineers. Logic is now, in my opinion, the industry standard (at least when it comes to writing and production use). ",
