            "answer_text": "I think to answer this question, which is ultimately a matter of opinion, in order to leave as little room for ambiguities as possible, we must first define \"Signature Song\". A signature song is the one song (or, in some cases, one of a few songs) that a popular and well-established recording artist or band is most closely identified with or best known for. For many artists, with many major hits in their careers, it can be difficult to choose a single song that defines them: I am thinking here of The Beatles, Michael Jackson, Madonna, or even Mariah Carey. But in some cases of artists with multiple hits, one of them is so massive that it is definitely associated with them indivisibly: Tony Bennet (\"I Left My Hear in San Francisco\", Aretha Franklin (\"Respect\"), The Police ( \"Every Breath You Take\"), or Backstreet Boys (\"I Want It That Way\"). Returning to the question, and the group that concerns us, it is true that The Turtles had several successes, including their version of Bob Dylan's song \"It Ain't Me Babe\", which reached the Billboard Top Ten in the late summer of 1965 as well as \"Let Me Be,\" \"You Baby,\" \"Grim Reaper of Love\", \"Can I Get to Know You Better\", \"You Know What I Mean\" and \"She's My Girl\". But \"Happy Together\", a song that had been rejected by countless performers before they decided to record it, became their biggest hit and as such it is for me their signature song. The song replaced the Beatles '\"Penny Lane\" at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in the spring of 1967 and it is The Turtles' only No. 1, remaining in the top position for three weeks. \"She'd Rather Be with Me\" may be the runner up to \"Happy Together\" in my book for their signature song, but it is a distant second.
