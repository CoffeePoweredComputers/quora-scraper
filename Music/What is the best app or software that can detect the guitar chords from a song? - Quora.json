            "answer_text": "You can figure out the chords by simply knowing that for most songs (or a good part of most songs) all the root/bass notes are either 1, 3, or 5 note intervals BELOW the melodic notes played on the main down beats. You can easily hear in your head when the melodic and root notes are the same (note interval of 1) when playing a familiar song. When they are not the same, you\u2019ve narrowed the options down to 3 or 5 note intervals below the melodic note. The last melodic and bass note (or tonic note) of the song are usually the same. The basic chords are typically the root note followed by the notes at 3 (or 10) and 5 note intervals ABOVE each root note. For more details, see later half of my other Quora posting. ",

As far as I've tested out(android for now) there are dedicated chord testers and detectors but their accuracy is about 40-70%. In a while I'll edit the answer with the best one(for android again) ",
