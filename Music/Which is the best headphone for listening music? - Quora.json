            "answer_text": "Like any consumer product, with headphones a lot of what you are paying for isn\u2019t actually the headphones. Most headphones are made in some factory in the far east for next to nothing, and what you pay for is the cost of transporting them, storing them, marketing them, getting them reviewed, getting well know people to be seen using them, and so on and so on. So to get the \u201cbest\u201d headphones you need to get away from consumer items. Have you ever watched a band play live, and seen the things they have in their ears? Those are called \u201cin ear monitors\u201d and they sound fantastic. Like really fantastic. The reason why they sound so good is they are very much a boutique product, they are very expensive and they are designed for the most discerning ears. Let me tell you about my pair of them.  See how they have the initials DS on them? Those are my initials. Every pair of these headphones is custom made to fit EXACTLY the ear canal of the customer. Before you have a set made for you, you have to go to an audiologist, and have \u201cimpressions\u201d made. This is when they inject wax into your ears to find the exact shape of your ear canal. Then, once this wax is set, you remove it (which is a weird and slightly painful experience) and send them to the manufacturer. There are a few companies that do this, but Ultimate Ears and JH Audio are the two that are probably most used at the top end these days. Mine are a set of JH 11s. JH11 PRO Each one has 4 speaker drivers in it. 2 for low, one for mid and one for top, as well as a 3 way passive crossover to make this possible. Also, as they are made to my specific ears, they are a perfect fit and block out more outside noise than a pair of foam ear plugs. What you have is a pair of Audio microscopes. I can hear things with these that I can\u2019t even notice on top of the range studio monitors. There is sometimes TOO MUCH detail. When working with Audio on them you can become obsessed with tiny details that you simply can\u2019t hear on any other listening system. If you want the best quality headphones money can buy, get a pair of these. These aren\u2019t even top of the range, there is a JH13 above it, but they are even more expensive, and I have been told it\u2019s a case of diminishing returns, and not really worth the extra. I can\u2019t vouch for this personally though as I\u2019ve never had a pair made. They are expensive though. To get the impressions made, send them to the US, have them manufactured, shipped back, and pay the import taxes on them was close to \u00a31000GBP. But if what you want is the best pair of headphones you will ever hear, forget about consumer brands and get a pair of these. ",

            "answer_text": "You have specifically asked about headphones, not earphones or in-ear monitors. If you\u2019re willing to get custom in-ear monitors, others (notably Dave Samwell) have provided information about that. The best of them can cost several thousand dollars but they\u2019re worth it if you like that type of device. Most people do; a minority vehemently don\u2019t. Now, to your question as stated: As for headphones, I have several preferences and that, preferences, is exactly what all this is about. Depending on the electronics used to drive the headphones and depending on your favorite type(s) of music, only your ears can make the choice. The \u201cbest\u201d are generally open-back \u2018phones where the design lets out the music to be heard by people near you and also lets in environmental noise. I spend time in noisy environments so those aren\u2019t suitable for me. See what I did there? I removed consideration of an entire class of \u2018phones, open-backs, because of my personal preference for sound isolation. While I could cite various name brands and models (and I will, in a moment), the way to find the best for you is to first decide on a basic style/design. Closed back \u2018phones if you need isolation,Open back \u2018phones if you don\u2019t,On-ear if you like that design and find it comfortable,Around-the-ear if you find that more comfy (I know I do.),Basic other comfort considerations that can only be determined by putting them on your head for a while,Durability for the intended use (If you need portability, they need to be surprisingly durable.), andAny other factors you deem relevant (This includes price, a factor I\u2019m ignoring since you asked about \u201cbest\u201d).Note that \u201csound quality\u201d is not listed above. That\u2019s because there\u2019s no use falling in love with the sound of a set that are completely unsuitable for your physical environment. For example, there are wonderful-sounding \u2018phones out there that are designed to be left at your desk and only used there. Attempting to travel with them would result in them getting broken the second time you tried to stuff them into a suitcase. With the above basic design criteria in mind, you should be able to read the literature and come up with a short list, consisting most likely of the top-level \u2018phones from: Audeze,HiFiMan,Focal,JPS Labs,Sennheiser,Stax,Sony,Mr. Speakers,Audioquest,Ultrasone,Abyss,oBravo,Sonoma, orsome brand that has slipped my mind.Note: The price of entry starts at about USD$1500 and goes up past USD$10,000. Now, this is the critical part. When you\u2019re spending that much money on \u2018phones, you\u2019d be stupid to not listen to them first. Just putting them on your head and listening to one favorite song will make the differences between them manifestly obvious. How so? There will be very expensive \u2018phones that you won\u2019t use because of the fit.There will be very expensive \u2018phones that, for some reason you can\u2019t articulate, just don\u2019t sound right to you. (Trust your gut and your ears and forget them.)There will also be less expensive \u2018phones you\u2019ll love because they are comfortable and sound great.You must try before you buy. That means going to: CanJam in the U.S.,Rocky Mountain Audio Fest in the U.S.,Axpona in the U.S,Munich High End in Europe,some other show I don\u2019t know about,a local audiophile meet-up where people come to show off their toys, ora well-stocked local dealer who has a variety to test. Such dealers are virtually non-existent but if you have one near you, use that resource.Listen to everything on your short list and make a decision. It won\u2019t be terribly difficult if you\u2019ve done a good job of narrowing down your short list by design criteria and don\u2019t get distracted by something that doesn\u2019t meet your real-world environmental needs. Personally, I live in an environment where I may have to close out external sound sources and I certainly don\u2019t want to share my music with anyone nearby. With those criteria in mind, I chose the Sony MDR-Z1R for its incredibly clarity. After tentatively making a choice, however, you really should test it with various headphone amps to make sure that the combination truly works. That, however, is beyond the scope of the question. PS - If anyone tries to sell you some Beats by Dr. Dre by telling you they are \u201chigh end\u201d or \u201chigh quality\u201d or \u201cexcellent sound\u201d, you\u2019re dealing with a rip-off artist. Beats are fine if you want to ridiculously over-pay for a style that impresses tween-age girls. If you want real music, though, stay far away from those awful things. ",
