            "answer_text": "I saw Copeland play live with the very brief reunited Police Tour. I never saw Bonham live, or even later Led Zep lineup. I am a fan of both but have to upset Bonham worshippers by pointing out that the majority of Zep songs are played at mid tempo in 4/4 time. I can only base my opinion of Bonham's live playing by watching DVD Song Remains the Same\u2026not ideal. I don't like it all that much. I prefer the playing of Brian Downey on Thin Lizzy Live and Dangerous and Bill Ward of Black Sabbath along with Ian Paice of Deep Purple for their less predictable drum style. Copeland to me is a more interesting style of player, far less predictable than Bonham, total control with more diverse dynamics , highly syncopated rhythms and colourful style. I have to say that seeing him live was confirmation of my belief that he well deserves his legendary drummers favourite status, sorry Mr. Bonham, you may have hit harder but you would have struggled to fill Stewarts place and I think Sting would tell you thanks, but no Thanks, I will keep Copeland haha!

            "answer_text": "I am comfortable with liking both of them equally because they are not from the same genre. John Bonham is is from the 1960s and Copeland is from the 1970s and beyond. Consider this, Bonham helped to pioneer early and middle Rock, along with his contemporaries, Baker, Moon, Starr, Watts, and other. Copeland and other percussionists fine tuned what they had learned from those legendary rock pioneers. There. Now everyone deserves a round of applause! Best regards, ",
