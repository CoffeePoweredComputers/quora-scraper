            "answer_text": "India's larger population is interested in music from films. As Indian movies generally have 5-6 or more songs there was no requirement of separate music industry in India. Movies have mass reach in India from metro cities to small villages. Songs have been integral part of Indian movies from the very start and this could be the reason most of our famous musicians are well known figures from film industries. Contrast to Indian cinema, western cinema do not generally have songs in movies. Thus a separate music industry evolved successfully. The acts had freedom for their songs and experimented with music leading to diversified music and genre.A separate music industry in India is also there but it is limited to some regional singers and doesnot have the mass reach. Also, Pop culture and individual albums never really worked out in India although there were many successful solo acts as Shaan, Sonu Nigam, Falguni Pathak, Lucky Ali, Alisa Chinoy etc during 90s and start of 2000s.Recently we have seen rise of many individual acts such as Mika, Honey Singh, Badshah. They are mainly from Punjabi music industry which always encouraged solo acts and have given us many good singers as Daler Mehandi, Gurdas Maan etc. Another reason for not so successful music industry could be lack of interest and fear of experiments from music labels for solo acts. This could be due to the fact that cd and audio sales in India is really low and people prefer songs from movie mainly. If indian people start buying and supporting Individual acts and bands, the music industry will automatically grow. Till then, jai ho Bollywood! ",

            "answer_text": "Because people in India generally want free music. They download it from pirates websites illegally. To have a good domestic music industry, there should be enough money, for money there should be sales. Very few people buy music CD\u2019s and albums. However also sometimes these albums are costly like 300\u2013400 Rs which I think no one wants to spend on a 10 song CD, where higher class people being exceptional. So it is both ways, people are enjoying Bollywood music which is now getting corrupted by western dance music. Also nowadays people listen to \u2018music\u2019 and not \u2018songs\u2019! If it has a good beat or a catchy tune then it's an instant hit. Many factors have affected and have affecting and will keep on affecting the dream of having India\u2019s own separate domestic music industry. ",
