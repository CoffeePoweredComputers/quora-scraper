            "answer_text": "Angus Young didn\u2019t write them. His late brother Malcolm did. Malcolm was the prime architect of AC/DC\u2019s sound. Angus was the stunt guitarist who could turn on the pyrotechnics, when called for, but Malcolm was the one who devised those riffs, which is why his early death is a real loss to music, even if he hadn\u2019t come up with any classic ones in a while. How did he come up with them? He\u2019s dead now and can\u2019t tell us, and even while he was alive, he was never very articulate about the songwriting process. Still, he did drop a few hints. In a 1992 interview, asked about the band\u2019s early songs, he said this: \u2018Live Wire\u2019 and \u2018It\u2019s A Long Way To The Top\u2019 came together almost immediately in the studio. When we played live in those days, we used to jam a lot on stage because we were so short of original material. We used to play \u2018Jumpin\u2019 Jack Flash\u2019 and put in 15 minutes of bullshit so we could fill up a 40-minute set. And the riffs for \u2018Live Wire\u2019 and \u2018It\u2019s A Long Way To The Top\u2019 came out of those jams. Back then we never went into the studio with anything more than a riff. In fact, we thought a riff was a song. We really didn\u2019t know any better. By the time of Let There Be Rock, they had become somewhat more disciplined: Now this was a steamer! I suppose we were getting a bit more serious and we wanted to get a rawer sound and cut out those commercial choruses like \u2018T.N.T.\u2019. We knew exactly what we wanted, which were three really strong live tracks to flesh out the set. \u2018Whole Lotta Rosie\u2019 was on that album, wasn\u2019t it? We knew it was going to be a sure\u2011fire winner, and \u2018Bad Boy Boogie\u2019 and \u2018Let There Be Rock\u2019 were the other two we felt would go the distance on stage. Those three overshadow most of the other songs on the album and ended up in the live set for years after. In a 2003 interview he was a little more open: How did what we know as the AC/DC sound come to be? We sort of, from the get-go, I said it was a rock 'n' roll band. We're gonna play rock 'n' roll. That's how we went, and that's how it's evolved. I was still playing guitar like a piano to get a vibe of a Little Richard song, so it was things like that, playing rhythm around where the rhythm came from on the record, but with two guitars. I'd listen to a song and say, \"Hang on, I like that piano thing,\" so I'd play the guitar like that and get the vibe from it, and it just evolved from the get-go. It was pretty obvious what to do; You don't think about rock 'n' roll, you just do it. How did you and Angus develop as a guitar tandem? From the get-go, I was wise enough to say, \"Well, I'm playing rhythm 'cause Angus could really soar with the leads.\" I used to mess around a little bit with lead at the time but not much; Angus, he was just so much better, he just went for it and it was brilliant. My place was sitting with rhythm, and I love rhythm. I've always loved it. There is no magical formula for writing good riffs. You play around until you get one that works. Malcolm Young\u2019s great idea was to play as little as possible, and let silence do a lot of the work. ",
