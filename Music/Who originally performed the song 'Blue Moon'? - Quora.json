            "answer_text": "\"Blue Moon\" is a classic tune written by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart in 1934, and has become a standard ballad style song.. It may be the first instance of the familiar \"50\u2019s progression\" in a popular song. The '50s progression is a progression and turnaround used in Western pop music. The progression, represented in typical Roman numeral analysis, is: I\u2013vi\u2013IV\u2013V. For example, in C major: C\u2013Am\u2013F\u2013G. As the name implies, it was common in the 1950s and early 1960s and is particularly associated with Doo-op and Be-bop. ",
