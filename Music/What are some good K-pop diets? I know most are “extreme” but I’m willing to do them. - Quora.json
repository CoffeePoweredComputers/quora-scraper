            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t call any idol or celebrity diet of any kind effective, unless it\u2019s something recommended by a doctor. I myself am on a strict diet of bland foods because of my UC. Now I\u2019m sure you mean what diets have helped idols lose weight the fastest, there\u2019s been a lot. But again, I wouldn\u2019t recommend trying any of them. First, TOP from BIGBANG pretty much starved himself to be accepted into YG. Yes he\u2019s a beautiful skinny legend now, but I didn\u2019t see him as fat, just a lil chubby. Second, Xiumin of EXO also was rumored to have done a diet. He said he didn\u2019t want to starve himself so his diet was to keep eating but in a healthy way. He said it can hurt your body no to eat. A genius: Kim Min-seok. Third, IU had something like a fruit for breakfast, veggie for lunch, and some kind of protein thing for dinner. (could be incorrect about his one and probably am). Fourth, 4minute was said to always be eating chicken breast and sweet potatoes while exercising early in the morning. The group was constantly under pressure for their weight, especially Hyuna. If I\u2019m not wrong, Hyuna started up the honey thighs trend in Korea. Fifth, Suzy from Miss A did something similar to IU. Potato, boiled chicken breast, then milk for dinner. She lost around 20kg in three or four months I believe. Sixth, and last, Changmin of 2AM. He was said to have weighed almost 100kg before his diet plan. His was one of the smartest I\u2019ve seen. It took some time but he did, obviously, lose the weight. He said he ate most of his food in the morning with multi vitamins and he worked out regularly. Considering what idols go through daily with all the training and schedules, his seems the safest I\u2019ve come across. As someone with a past eating disorder, I don\u2019t encourage losing weight like idols have. Your body can have issues if you just suddenly stop your usual routine. Introducing new and healthier foods is best and asking a doctor for advice. Always be safe. ~J ",

            "answer_text": "So I myself have tried some of these diets and they are extreme and I don\u2019t recommend you do them but here you go. THE WATERMELON DIET This one is a little popular in the industry and is used by Park Bom (who has a lot of methods to lose weight). How it works is for a few days or a week or maybe if your willing to go really extreme, three weeks, you only eat watermelon. Watermelon is low in calories and is 70% water and has a lot of nutrients. You can only drink water and work out everyday I recommend dancing or running for workouts or cardio. You shouldn\u2019t snack on anything and you shouldn\u2019t eat anything after 7:30pm. If you workout and stick to it you lose 2\u20133 k.g in around a weeks. THE LETTUCE DIET Another one used by Park Bom and 2NE1. They used this for a week maybe two to slim down before comebacks and lost 3 k.g Like the Watermelon diet you can only eat Lettuce and drink water. Lettuce is good for you and tricks your stomach into thinking it is full. You will have to workout obviously I normally do dancing and running. It makes you lose weight around 3 k.g in a week or two. THE PAPER CUP DIET I haven\u2019t actually tried this one but I have seen it. It is very popular and used by lots of idols mainly female. It works by getting a paper cup I think and filling it with something to eat. Nothing unhealthy mostly fruits and nuts. And for a whole week you have to only eat that and do intense workouts. Even if you do it for around three days you will lose a few pounds and a lot of weight. THE 1,000 CALORIE DIET This one isn\u2019t really that extreme but does help to lose weight and is a more easy diet and I think is used by SNSD. Basically you can eat anything (you can eat unhealthy stuff but it\u2019s better if you don\u2019t) that is 1,000 calories. It must be 1,000 calories on the dot nothing more maybe a little less but nothing more. You also have to do intense workouts you lose a few pounds in a few days. THE WATER DIET Now this is the most extreme one I\u2019ve seen it\u2019s basically starving yourself. You can only drink water for a week, no food. It was used by a Boy Group it makes you lose so much weight but is unhealthy. It\u2019s baiscally a water fast. I have done it for 3 days and let me say you lose weight and it clears acne. However you tend to overeat and everything comes back. You shouldn\u2019t really work out but you will lose so much weight if you do, if you try this and do work out then don\u2019t do intense working out. ",
