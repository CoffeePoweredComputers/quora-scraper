Justin Bieber is the only Artist who has 5 song more than 1B views on YouTube and the second artist to have 3 songs more than 1B plays on Spotify. Really he is one of the most famous and successful Artist. Well according to me his best song list should be like this \u2022 Sorry Justin uploaded his carrier's biggest hit song Sorry in 22nd October 2015 on his official YouTube channel and became 6th most viewed video on YouTube with approximately 2.9 B views at current time.  \u2022 Baby A song from his carrier's first album My World called Baby. Justin did collab with Ludacris for making this song more special. This song changed Justin's carrier and became one of the best pop star in world.  \u2022 Despacito Remix Despacito by Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi featuring Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber is one of the best song ever in history. the song spent 16 weeks at No1 on chart of Billboard Hot 100 tying Maria Carey's and Boyz II Men's \u201c One Sweet day \u201d for most week spent at No. 1 .
