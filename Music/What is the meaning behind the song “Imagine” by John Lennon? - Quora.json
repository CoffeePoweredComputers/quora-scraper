            "answer_text": "This song is one of the most widely misunderstood songs in modern times, although that misunderstanding is understandable. :) The opening lines are: Imagine there\u2019s no Heaven, it\u2019s easy if you try, No Hell below us, above us only sky\u2026 If you take these lines at face value, they sound like a direct attack on what Christians, and many Jews and Muslims, believe. Therefore, it struck a number of people as an Atheist Anthem, disparaging all religion. In truth, it is not that. Imagine does not reject God as such, or Jesus or Mohammed for that matter; Imagine tries to persuade us to be on guard against the things that divide and separate us. The real, lasting concepts in religion\u2014the things that Jesus and Buddha actually taught\u2014ought to bring us together, in Lennon\u2019s view, not be a cause for war. When religions give us reasons to hate each other or fight each other, they become toxic to the human race. The same thing, in Lennon\u2019s mind, can be said about the political entities (countries and nations) that separate us, along with the borders that politicians and military leaders draw up. In the spirit of Imagine, we might ask: Who drew up these borders, anyway? Who is to say that one group of people have the God-given right to live on one side of a wall\u2026 and another group does not have that right? Are we not all members of the same species? In the end, Imagine is about envisioning a world in which more things bring us together than separate us. Lennon tells us that we may not seem to live in such a world now\u2026 but by picturing it, we might begin to bring it into existence. ",

To be fair he had recently bought Tittenhurst Park mansion and the upkeep was quite pricey.So, whilst its meant that every boring hippy with an acoustic guitar could virtue signal their self-righteousness (or as McCartney sang at the time \u2018preaching back\u2019) as he hinted at in interviews \u201cIts about me\u2026. again!\u201d.
