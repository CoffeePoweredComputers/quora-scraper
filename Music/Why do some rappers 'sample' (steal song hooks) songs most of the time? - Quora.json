            "answer_text": "I am not in the music industry and don't claim to be. Songs have been remade through the years, and lots of times people don't even realize it. Come on feel the noise by Slade was remade by Quiet Riot and most did not know that As a classic example. However, I dont buy the \u201c\"sampling is more creative than coming up with your own music\u201d arguement. When people remake songs they either do it to honor the original musician or do it for money. Several up and coming musicians have remade a song as their first hit to get popular and then start to make their own music. That is for money. I don't think all sampling is simply not being creative, but I do think it's done for money knowing the song will appeal to different types of culture. I do not consider those that sample creative no matter how many of those that do it claim it is. I am not saying it\u2019s easy and it doesn't take talent. But creative? No. Of course those who sample will claim it is creative, but they would not admit it is not. Either out of arrogance or self preservation. Either they come up with the idea to sample and then alter the words and other parts or come up with the lyrics and try and come up with a rythm and melody or beat and can not come up with one, so they then say let's sample this old song Bc we can not come up with our own. Either way I see no creativity. Do I see talent? Yes of course. But please do not insult us and say it's more creative to take an old song and use it rather than come up with your own. Perhaps it helps those that sample sleep better at night if they convince them selves it's creative. It's not just hip hop that has done this but for the past decade hip hop has used older songs more than any other genre. The reputation is not unwarranted. That may not be PC to say but I think it's simply true. I do not mean to sound harsh but I am simply not a fan of remakes unless it is done out of respect or to honor an artist. I do not see a lot of hip hop honoring old 80\u2019s songs, I see it as cashing in on money and an opportunity. That is perfectly ok, just do not call it anything other than what it is. ",

            "answer_text": "My answer will not be popular, but I will say it anyway. Hip-hop was born from a world of poverty. Many young adults in the ghettos of Chicago, New York, and other cities had an innate desire to express themselves and their situation, as human nature asks of so many of us. However, because of their plight, they could not afford instruments, or the lessons required to master them. So instead, they did what anyone does when there is a lack of resources: They improvised. Great teacher, philosopher, and rapper KRS-ONE said that it is the knowledge of not-knowing that caused a great knowing, and this was the catalyst for a great movement in Hip-hop.  They took their parents' old records and brought a microphone and started poetically expressing their plight and life over the rhythms in the records, thus creating Rhythm And Poetry (r.a.p.).  Now, while the technology to create and produce music organically and originally is now ubiquitous, the essence of the movement stays so true, and permeates even now.  In the eyes of a rather Euro-centric America, it looks like a lack of creativity. But in reality, it is ultimate creativity, to invent something new out of spare and broken parts. ",
