            "answer_text": "Pinpointing the first song in any musical genre can be a fool's game. Jim Dawson and Steve Propes wrote the book What Was the First Rock 'N' Roll Record? and came up with 50 different answers. So, the idea that you're going to find consensus on what the first heavy metal song was is probably not going to happen. But that doesn't mean I won't have fun trying! The earliest use of the term \"heavy metal\" in relation to music was the 1967 album Hapshash And The Coloured Coat Featuring The Human Host And The Heavy Metal Kids by the avant-garde British psychedelic poster art collective, Hapshash and the Coloured Coat. Hapshash and the Coloured Coat were non-musicians, but they enlisted the help of an actual group they dubbed The Human Host and the Heavy Metal Kids. The Human Host and the Heavy Metal Kids later evolved into a psychedelic band called Art, which later became the band Spooky Tooth. (As for why a record company would award a recording contract to a bunch of psychedelic poster artists, well... the drugs were probably really good back then.) Anyhow, the music isn't exactly \"heavy metal\" by modern-day standards, but it's a missing link between hippie drum circle chanting and early 1970s German progressive rock that can be enjoyably clangy, noisy, and loud if not exactly \"metal.\" Here's their recording of \"Empire of the Sun,\" where they go crazy for about 15 minutes.  Another early usage of \"heavy metal\" in a musical context was the music publishing company, Heavy Metal Music Inc., which was established by The Fugs circa 1968, probably after the Fugs left ESP-Disk Records because they were getting underpaid on royalties. Hapshash and the Fugs probably both borrowed \"heavy metal\" from the writer William S. Burroughs, who used the term in his 1962 novel The Ticket That Exploded to refer to a type of drug that was more addictive than heroin. In the novel, Burroughs wrote, \"What we call opium or junk was a very much diluted form of heavy metal addiction.\" Another 1960s psychedelic band, Soft Machine, named themselves after another novel in the same trilogy as The Ticket That Exploded, so there were definitely hippies at the time who knew about Burroughs and his references to \"heavy metal.\" As for the Fugs themselves, they never really called their music \"metal,\" heavy or otherwise. The Fugs' music could get loud, but they were largely amateur non-musicians who came from the New York Beat poetry scene. So they could certainly get loud, but it wasn't clear if they were loud by accident or on purpose. Anyhow, here's an early Fugs song \"Kill for Peace.\" I suppose you could call it \"protopunk\" or \"protometal,\" but I don't know if you could call it heavy metal.  According to the Etymology section of Wikipedia's entry on \"heavy metal,\" the first reference to \"heavy metal\" in a music review was applied to the album A Long Time Comin' by the rock group The Electric Flag. Rock critic Barry Gifford (who later got more famous collaborating on screenplays with David Lynch) said of the album, \"This is the new soul music, the synthesis of white blues and heavy metal rock.\" Unfortunately, the Electric Flag almost definitely wouldn't be called \"metal\" by current standards. They're a band doing blues guitar riffs with a backup horn section, but definitely not \"metal\" since most heavy metal bands aren't as R&B-based or as reliant on horns.  In January 1968, the band Iron Butterfly released the album Heavy. It's notable because it's one of the first times a band referred to themselves as \"heavy,\" although the band did not call themselves \"metal.\" On the other hand, they did name themselves after iron, which is a kind of metal. Certainly, the name Iron Butterfly is a great metaphor for a hard rock band, a metaphor which conveys how music can be \"hard\" like metal yet move like a butterfly. Iron Butterfly is certainly \"harder\" by current standards than Hapshash & the Coloured Coat, the Fugs, or the Electric Flag, but still a little too dependent on Doors-like keyboard sounds to be too \"metal.\" (Also in 1968, Steppenwolf sang about \"heavy metal thunder\" in Born To Be Wild, as David Durham has already mentioned.)  One rock critic notable for popularizing the term \"heavy metal\" was Mike Saunders, often nicknamed \"Metal Mike\" Saunders, because of his coverage of early 1970s metal and also his stint as a vocalist for the punk band Angry Samoans. According to Wikipedia, the first time Saunders used the term \"heavy metal,\" he used the term pejoratively to describe the UK band Humble Pie as a \"a noisy, unmelodic, heavy metal-leaden shit-rock band.\" The next time Saunders used the term \"heavy metal,\" he used it as a compliment to describe the album Kingdom Come by the band Sir Lord Baltimore. One of the tracks on the album, \"Lady of Fire,\" was borrowed by Deep Purple for their song \"Woman from Tokyo,\" so you can definitely say we have a definitely heavy metal pedigree here. So, if we were going to point to the first band that was both called \"heavy metal\" and might still be called \"heavy metal\" by today's standards, I'd go with Sir Lord Baltimore. If they were good enough for Deep Purple to rip off, that's good enough for me.  On the other hand, you could try to pinpoint the first heavy metal record by looking for earliest record ever to be classified as \"heavy metal,\" even though it wasn't classified as \"metal\" when it was made. If you look at the Oxford English Dictionary historical etymology on \"heavy metal,\" the earliest reference they have to \"heavy metal\" as music comes from a 1973 issue of the rock magazine Crawdaddy, which refers to the bands Black Sabbath and Black Oak Arkansas as heavy metal. Since Sir Lord Baltimore's Kingdom Come came out in December 1970 and Black Sabbath's self-titled debut came out in February 1970, that means Sabbath easily takes precedence over Sir Lord Baltimore, although Sir Lord Baltimore probably don't get as much as credit as they deserve for being the heavy metal pioneers they were. But that isn't the only entry the Oxford English Dictionary has on \"heavy metal.\" The dictionary also cites a 1975 book on the Beatles, which describes a Beatles song as \"heavy metal,\" but ironically, it applies that distinction to \"Hey Bulldog,\" not \"Helter Skelter.\" Interestingly, \"Hey Bulldog\" wasn't released until the 1969 Yellow Submarine soundtrack, but it was recorded back in February 1968, several months before the September 1968 recording of \"Helter Skelter.\" So perhaps \"Helter Skelter\" is not even the Beatles' first \"heavy metal\" song? Musicologist Allan Kozinn even called the Beatles song by George Harrison, \"It's All Too Much,\" as \"proto-heavy metal,\" but \"It's All Too Much\" was recorded in May 1967, although it wasn't released until appearing with \"Hey Bulldog\" on the Yellow Submarine soundtrack in 1969. So, if you really wanted to push it, you could say that \"Helter Skelter\" was the Beatles' third \"heavy metal\" song, but that claim leans very heavily on quite a few technicalities. Then there's the whole controversy over whether Led Zeppelin was \"heavy metal.\" I certainly remember Led Zep being labeled as \"heavy metal\" during my youth, and lots of \"metalheads\" love them, but there are heavy metal purists out there who are quite insistent that Led Zeppelin is not metal, but Black Sabbath most definitely is. (See Why are Led Zeppelin not considered heavy metal by a lot of people? and Is Led Zeppelin a heavy metal band? for some message board debates about the topic.) I think the basis for the distinction is that Led Zeppelin, while they can play very \"heavy,\" are extremely rooted in blues and folk music forms. Black Sabbath, by contrast, plays primarily in minor keys, uses \"down-tuned\" guitars like most heavy metal bands do, and makes heavy use of the \"devil's tritone,\" which makes them sound more \"evil\" than Zeppelin. On the other hand, some say Led Zeppelin is more metal, because at least Jimmy Page really dabbled in Satanism, while Black Sabbath were just posers pretending to be Satanists. All I can say is, if this argument breaks out in a dive bar, I'll be wisely heading for the exits. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Because genre names are \"soft\" terms that change over time, should only be considered as rough guidelines, and of which rarely two people agree upon an exhaustive definition. Furthemore, while it is true that \"Helter Skelter\" - even by today's standards - might be considered a proto-heavy metal tune, it is still predated by, for example \"You Really Got Me\" (The Kinks) and \"My Generation\" (The Who). And again: Some might agree that one of these is the first heavy metal tune; others might not. If you'd wanna argue that \"Helter Skelter\" is, indeed, the first heavy metal tune, you could play it back-to-back with later heavy metal tunes and point out the similarities to support your cause. But, in turn, other people could point out the differences. None of you would be able to definitely prove anything, other than what the term \"heavy metal\" meant to you, respectively. While I do think that musical labels are not only natural, but indeed also necessary in that they define and isolate an auditive movement from other stuff that objectively sounds different, I equally find that genre definitions tend to have different meanings from one person to another. And this is especially true in the metal community, since authenticism here is a hugely important factor of measurement. Personally, I'd consider the first true heavy metal tune to be \"The Ripper\" by Judas Priest. Because at this point, all of those tidbits and appendixes from other genres, like blues, jazz, folk and psychedelic rock of the late 60's/turn of the 70's are done away with. And what is left is pure, straightforward, hard-hitting, riff-based heavy metal. This is when the term \"heavy metal\" started to make sense. ",
