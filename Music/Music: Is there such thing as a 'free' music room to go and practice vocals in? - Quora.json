            "answer_text": "When I was in college, the church I attended was down the street from where I lived. The minister of the church gave me a key to the church and permitted me to practice there pretty much whenever I wanted (sometimes this was very late at night). Do you have any sort of similar connection that might be of help to you in this? If you have a college with a music department near you, it may be worth checking to see what its policy is regarding non-students practicing in the rooms there. You might be pleasantly surprised to find that the school's rules are broad enough to allow you a space (usually due to the college's policies on interaction with the community more broadly: they feel this freedom of use is \"giving back\").

            "answer_text": "Daniel Landis is onto something good. Churches, youth/recreation/nonprofit organization centers, schools (of any educational level), warehouses, squats, underground music consortia, parking lots that don't call the cops on you, public amphitheaters (including ones in secluded or outdoorsy areas), approved busking locations, some rooftops or cellars, and various other places can offer you free room and accommodations. You need to discuss your parameters and their availability and requirements.  Sometimes you can gain access by contributing to whatever is going on, instead of being a random stranger trying to get free time at their facility. Some music/instrument stores or locations where people offer music and vocal lessons may have rooms that are periodically available for walk-in use, but the conditions may not be ideal and you will not necessarily have the same level of freedom as using a public stage or church room or whatnot. Talk to musicians in your area, and contact all the locations within your area of mobility that might offer these kinds of opportunities. ",
