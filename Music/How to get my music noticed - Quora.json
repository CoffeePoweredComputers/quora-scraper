            "answer_text": "If you want your music to be noticed, you first need to upload your music to the corresponding platform. I would recommend Spotify as a music platform. The number of users is large and the audience is wide. According to Spotify's big data research, music that gets more views and plays is more likely to be noticed by people. In the early stage, we can use the \u0391io-S\u0442ream-\u0412o\u0442 to quickly increase views and plays. It can be used to automatically play music, automatically like, comment on music, and follow music. It allows you to manage multiple Spotify accounts. You can use one account to search for users who are interested in your music and use another account to send them private messages. Allows you to increase views and plays in a short time. Only after the data is good can you attract more people to listen to your music.  ",

It seems that SoundCloud has some sort of algorithm for showing people new music that fits their categories if other people are listening to it, so the views tend to increase exponentially for a short period of time, then die out until you post it on social media again.
