            "answer_text": "No, Tidal is a Premium music streaming subscription service. Tidal has two tiers: Premium and HiFi. The price for each tier depends on whether you qualify for one of Tidal\u2019s discounts. There is no free subscription level, but Tidal offers a 30-day free trial for new subscribers, and for a limited time, you can get a whole six months for just $4, and that goes for the HiFi tier, too. The Premium plan gives you unlimited ad-free music across multiple devices as well as access to exclusive live Tidal X events. You can create new playlists, import your existing playlists, and download songs and videos for offline listening/viewing. The HiFi subscription gives you all of the same features as Premium, but with lossless CD quality for all tracks streamed using FLAC 16bit/44.1kHz, and access to the hi-res, Tidal Masters recordings. It\u2019s also the tier that offers a limited selection of Sony 360 Reality Audio and Dolby Atmos Music tracks (more on these formats later). An individual Tidal subscription, regardless of plan, lets you stream music to one device at a time (online mode); however, up to five devices can be used in offline mode simultaneously. Family plans give you a total of six user accounts.

            "answer_text": "No, Tidal does not offer free plan. If you want free music, go to Spotify. Tidal\u2019s two subscription plans - Tidal Premium and Tidal HiFi cost $9.99 and $19.99 respectively with a 30-day free trial. You can give it a try before deciding which service you want to subscribe to. I am a two-year Tidal HiFi subscribers. Besides some buggy integrations with some devices or receivers (which can mostly be solved by Audfree Tidal converter), I am pretty satisfied with audio quality especially with those Master tracks. It is some money well spent for me. ",
