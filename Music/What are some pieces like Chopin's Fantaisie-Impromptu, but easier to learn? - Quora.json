            "answer_text": "Fantasie impromptu is actually not as hard as some imagine. It fits very well under the hand, and the outer sections are virtually identical until the end, so there's not too much to learn. The main difficulty is fitting three against four, yet here again if you say 1 2and 3and 4, you'll be surprised how quickly both hands can be integrated together. You ask about similar but easier pieces - but that really depends on how much easier! You might look at some of Einaudi's mood pieces from his Le Onde and I Giorni. They are around lower intermediate standard, and very popular. ",

            "answer_text": "You learn every piece of music exactly the same way. You start from nothing, learn the notes and rhythms, consult with a teacher on the interpretation of the score, practice for muscle memory, and study the score for understanding. If you want to play Fantasie-Impromptu - learn it. I went against my teacher\u2019s advice and started on some very difficult literature very early - Fantasie-Impromptu was one, but also the Beethoven Pathetique, which I could play beginning to end by age 9, Schubert impromptus, Schumann\u2019s Fantasiestucke and Kinderszenen, Liszt Hungarian Rhapsodies. Was it easy? No, but I didn't mind. Did I play them well? Not then. I\u2019d like to think I do now, 25 years later. But I still remember how hard I worked then. ",
