            "answer_text": "The voice is mainly a product of your vocal cords but it's projection is also dependent on the chest movement, nasal cavity and the tongue. The nose does have a part to play in the way the voice is expressed. The nasal twang in some singers' voices maybe are related to narrow noses. The sinuses around the nasal cavity provide the voice with resonance. A simple way to know the effects of the nose in your voice is to just close your nostrils with your fingers and sing your favourite song. Some studies have shown that rhinoplasties can change voice to have more of a nasal quality or have loss of resonance. This maybe due to narrowing of the nasal cavity and damage to the sinuses respectively. These studies have been disputed by many plastic surgeons who have operated on professional singers. Truely trained professional singing is more of chest, throat and tongue than the nose. So the effects of rhinoplasties on trained singers are minimal at best. Moreover a good nose job will not reduce internal space in the nasal cavity.  In any case, a rhinoplasty is unlikely to improve voice quality but may actually risk losing the pre-surgical voice quality. ",

            "answer_text": "Rhinoplasty could affect the resonance of the voice. However, that is only one aspect of what makes a voice sound the way it does. Other aspects include the size of both the singer and the vocal folds, the health of the voice, the breath flow, the shape of the vocal tract, and the command of the range (amongst other things).  For a visual way to think about it, take instruments. String instruments, for example, have a basic shape and the strings lie the same way. However, each string instrument can be a different size (such as a violin to a cello), the strings can have a different thickness, and the quality of the materials to make the instrument can change its sound. Changing one element wouldn't change the whole instrument, or even the type of instrument.  So while rhinoplasty could, theoretically, alter your vocal resonance, it wouldn't alter it so drastically to turn a normal voice into a miraculous voice. The best way to improve the quality of someone's voice would be through technical training provided by a qualified voice teacher.  ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it sure could affect your voice. Changing the airflow through your nose by doing a Septoplasty could very well change the nasal quality of your voice, changing its quality and character. The mere fact of having a surgery and intubation tube placed between your vocal cords could also change your voice. IMHO, you should have a medic alert bracelet that says use LMA, not endotracheal tube for intubation and you should ask for this if you decide to have your Rhinoplasty. I have done Rhinoplasty on singers over my 20 + year career but I would never promise them that their voice may not be affected. If it helps you, it never did to any extent but it is a possibility.
