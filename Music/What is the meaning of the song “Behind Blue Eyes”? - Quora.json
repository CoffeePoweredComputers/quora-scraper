            "answer_text": "It\u2019s about the loneliness of success. It was originally written for a character in Tommy, then edited out and had a proposed use in the shelved Lifehouse project. I believe that it is supposed to be about the character\u2019s feeling about power and the feeling of separation that power creates between him and other people. Of course, like most songs, there is probably something a little autobiographical about it. The blue eyed Townsend did feel isolated from the band, and from his fans. The idea of the song is that other people make statements about what someone famous may be feeling, but can\u2019t actually get into their head and see through their eyes. Hence, no one knowns what it\u2019s like to like to be the bad man, to be the sad man, behind blue eyes. He\u2019s describing himself as he\u2019s seen and as he is. I don\u2019t think Townsend is one life\u2019s naturally happy people. There is an idea that rich and succesful people should be happy because of it, but he is saying in this song that his life has troubles like everyone else\u2019s but others don\u2019t understand him.
