            "answer_text": "Your motivation(s) for learning likely drive the answers to your questions. Are you looking to entertain yourself? Others, too? Do you with to play with others? What kind of music do you like? Are you looking for an intellectual challenge? Are your friends also musicians and this helps you to socially bond? Would you like to entertain piano as a possible occupation or career path? Etc. Etc. These are just sample drill down questions on getting a better grasp on your motive. Once you understand your own goals and intentions, you can begin to answer some of the downstream questions as you prepare to learn and pursue piano ownership. Regardless of your motives, I would posit these guidelines: This is really challenging stuff. Unless you have learned another instrument, music theory (understanding music \u201con paper\u201d but not playing an instrument, or are just innately super-gifted, this will be tough. You must have patience and be determined, unwilling to let the difficulty of learning dissuade you.You will even make yourself cringe as you begin. I hate to say it, but you are likely going to sound really bad at first. And the music you will be playing will be infantile in complexity. Persevere through this initial phase which could last many months or even a year.Be a \u201cSteady Eddie\u201d. Structure time to learn. How much time and frequency depends on your goals, motives and spare time so I will not dictate what this should be other than to say that you should be spending some time at least 5 out of 7 days of the week doing some kind of practice. Frequency is often more important than duration, at least that has been my experience. In other words, you may get more out of practicing 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week than practicing 2.5 hours one day a week. Similarly you may get more out of practicing 30 minutes twice a day than practicing an hour at one stretch every day.Keep the prize in front of you. Listen to good piano music. Figure out what your stretch goals are musically and if there are any particular artists, songs, genres, etc. that appeal to you, keep listening to these. Knowing that you may not be able to play like this right away, continuing to listening should provide a font of inspiration when you are otherwise weary.Your next big decisions will be around learning method and an instrument. I would heartily recommend that, whether you want to be self-taught or have an instructor, to learn to read music and learn some basic theory. Yes, there are many good or great musicians that never learned how to read (Erroll Garner first comes to mind), but they are the rarity and how do we know these pianists would not have been even better had they learned these rudiments. If you are a very skilled self-learner (and hopefully you know at this point in life if you are), you may be able to get some method books and scout around YouTube, Patreon, etc. for instructional tips. If this is not you, get a teacher. Unless you are able to naturally learn this way you will become discouraged. Even if you start out this way, I would recommend lessons at some point in time. I started out by teaching myself theory, how to read and play music, and the most basic technique. Nonetheless, eventually getting a teacher was a great accelerant. The thing is, you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know, and a good or excellent teacher does. Often the best way in evaluating teacher is not to hear clips of them playing, but to hear their students. Of course, reviews are great. Understand that many good teachers are looking for some kind of commitment to lessons, so don\u2019t be taken aback by that if they do. If you are serious and are willing to pay for instruction, don\u2019t haggle or make a decision based on nickels and dimes. Most often, a teacher\u2019s published rates are \u201cthe\u201d rates. Perhaps you might be able to strike a deal if you pre-pay for a set of lessons but otherwise accept the rates as they are. If the difference between a so-so teacher (as best you can understand based on reviews, referrals, student clips, etc.) and a good or excellent teacher is small change, then level up. You won\u2019t regret it. Do your best to communicate to your teacher in lessons what is going on in your practice life, where you struggle, etc. High visibility into your inner workings will give your teacher valuable insights to make you a better player. Sometimes a good, or even great teacher is not a good fit. Give yourself 3\u20136 months at least to find this out. Lastly, you wondering about buying a piano. If your goal is to be proficient and especially if you are going to learn classical, avoid a spring action electronic keyboard at all costs! It\u2019s only if you want to doodle around a little bit with more contemporary electronics-based music that a non-weighted action keyboard is tolerable. If you are yet unsure how long-term this would be you might consider a rental of an instrument or keyboard. Though many schooled pianists might advise against getting a weighted keyboard instead of piano, there are certain setting in which this is a pretty good option. This is the case where you have really limited space, or you could potentially find yourself in a contentious situation with a neighbor or family member because you are practicing so much that it is creating tension owing to their low tolerance of your beautiful music. With an electronic keyboard you are able to either control the volume or put on headphones and practice whenever and for how long you want. This is also not a bad option, in my opinion, because many of these keyboards produce a rather realistic sound of a higher quality piano. If I were starting out again and had limited funds, this is the route I would go. In shopping for a weighted keyboard, I might try a dealership that sells both good or premium grand pianos as well as the keyboards and play lots of notes on the regular piano first and then compare to the keyboard, looking for a good approximation of resistance, depth of note depression, etc. If you stick with it and up your game, you may want to save up for a baby grand or grand piano at some point in time, which opens a whole \u2018nother huge topic. Let us know when you\u2019re ready and good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "I think you need to know WHY. Playing piano is hard and takes a lot of dedicated practice daily over a long period of time (10 years to a lifetime). If you don\u2019t feel a strong pull to do it, you will soon give up, having spent time and money. If you have that strong pull, I think the second thing you need to think about is what piano. You are going to want to practice daily, maybe not disturb other people, yet have an instrument you enjoy playing. Personally - just starting out you will find that it will take between 1 and 2 years, maybe slightly longer to develop feelings in your fingers. I have been recommending people buy the cheapest digitial piano they can find with proper weighted key action with a view to replacing it in that sort of 1 to 2 year timeframe (I always suggest a Yamaha P45 as its the cheapest quality piano that I can find). Give yourself time to learn what you need, what is a nice to have and what is a gimmick that hasn\u2019t the value the marketing people suggest it has. Use the time to try other pianos, particularly acoustic pianos. If able just go to piano shops and try them out Recognize and budget for the fact that you are going to need a teacher. Depending on you age start off at between 30 minutes to 45 minutes a week (young children can\u2019t concentrate for more that 30 minutes - adults can so longer). Once you get better an hour a week is probably the right amount (in 2017 I started with an hour a fortnight, but very quickly changed that to an hour a week - and that is were it has stayed). Finally make time in your life for an hour of practice 6 days out of every 7 for most weeks. Your teacher should teach you how to practice efficiently in that time, but you are going to be prepared to set aside that time to give it your full concentration. ",
