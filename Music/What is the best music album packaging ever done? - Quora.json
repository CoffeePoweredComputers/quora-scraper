            "answer_text": "My favorites would be albums by Tool. Tool's packaging has twice been nominated for the Best Recording Packaging Grammy for 2006's Aenima and 2006's 10,000 Days, with the latter winning the 2007 Grammy.   All of their album art has been overseen by the guitarist, Adam Jones, and is usually done in concert with another artist.  Alex Grey, Cam de Leon and Chet Czar have all contributed art to Tool's album artwork.   I would include pictures but it really wouldn't do the packaging any justice.   The first two albums, Opiate and Undertow were interesting but the third album, Aenima, is where the packaging concept really took off.  It included a lenticular jewel case that would animate several of the pictures in the insert.  The next album, Lateralus, included an insert that is \"translucent and flips open to reveal the different layers of the human body. Disguised in the brain matter on the final layer is the word \"God\". (wikipedia) Finally, 10,000 Days:  The compact disc packaging for 10,000 Days consists of a thick cardboard-bound booklet partly covered by a flap holding a pair of stereoscopic eyeglasses, which can be used to view a series of images inside (including, for the first time since Undertow, an individual portrait of each band member). Viewed with the glasses, the artwork produces an illusion of depth and three-dimensionality. Alex Grey, who created a majority of the album art for Lateralus and its accompanying video \"Parabola\", reprised his role for 10,000 Days. The CD face itself is decorated with stylized eyes, arranged in a seemingly logarithmic spiral toward the center (adapted from a previous Alex Grey painting, \"Net of Being\").   Other favorites would be The Downward Spiral and The Fragile (nine inch nails) and limited edition of Kid A (Radiohead). ",

            "answer_text": "I was somewhat surprised to learn from the wikipedia page that Thick as a Brick was actually a spoof of concept albums.   It is definitely the concept of concept album taken to an extreme, and I find it quite enjoyable to listen to. The concept/conceit here is that TaaB is the text of an epic poem, written by a little boy, and set to music by the group Jethro Tull. The text is a rumination on being an old mind in a young body et cetera. The music is remarkable for being a single track, which fades out and back in when you flip the LP. The packaging is brilliant: if you open the cover, you find a whole newspaper of the fictional town of St Cleve, where the young poet, Gerald Bostock, lives. The paper is full of nonsense items that will keep you occupied way longer than the running time of the album. And of course there is the text of the poem, as well as a news item that Jethro Tull will set the poem to music. ",
