            "answer_text": "My cousin, born in 1984, is a huge fan of J-pop so I can shortly comment on it. 1: Average Japanese have problems with their legs and heights. Their legs tend to be not so straight and they are not as tall as Korean. This will make the idol industry much difficult to appeal to the audiences overseas in terms of impression and sexuality, in contrast with Korean idols. This may make some J idols be contained by certain styles like \u201cKawayi/cute girls\u201d than be \u201csexy women\u201d.  K-pop idols on the left vs J-pop idols on the right. 2: Average Japanese have more structural facial features than average Korean who tend to have the flatter faces. The latter would get more advantages in term of plastic surgery like drawing something in a white paper. This makes K idols more \u201cindustrial\u201d and who hence look more \u201chomogenous\u201d to always catch the attention of the core fans. But J idols sometimes look like the \u201cUnited Nations\u201d that the fans may be more casual to love specific features of the idols than overall appreciating J idols. Once their favorite J idol is gone, the fans may lose interest on J-pop.     It\u2019s clear to see that J idols are more \u201cdiverse\u201d and unique due to their structural faces against the \u201chomogenous\u201d K idols. This is a big problem to J pop industry. Again, we can introduce the US here to see how J idols may be perceived by Asian audiences.  This is an American idol drama based on Japanese anime. Due to \u201cdiversity\u201d, it is hard to send messages to the audiences.    But if you look at the adaptation to the same anime, you have to acknowledge that Japanese, Korean and Chinese versions, doesn't matter if you like it or not, will send a clear message to the fans for the \u201cbeauty standard\u201d and the impression. With this regard, Jpop to overseas Asian music fans is like the American drama here. 3: While inheriting most of the merits of J-pop, K-pop is more international and trending. K-pop basically developed from J-pop. For example, the idol industry, slavery contracts of idols, strict management on idols, group performance, \u201cindustrial productions\u201d of idols every year, the hierarchy in the company, insertion of English in every song are all from Japan. But unlike J-pop that still largely adopt Japanese features such as the teeth fashion and \u201cKawayi\u201d genre, K-pop largely studied from the US with its music genres and make K-pop idols appeal to international audiences by more sexual and straightforward marketing of idols. 4: Japanese market is too developed against the Korean market. J-pop doesn\u2019t have a strong motivation to explore the overseas market, while Kpop has to. 5: True music fans overseas barely listen to K-pop because when they refer to K-pop, they would think about the idols than the real \u201cmusicians\u201d. But since there isn\u2019t a remarkable difference between Korean and others other than the idol industry, K-pop\u2019s influence overseas only exists in term idols. As for J-pop, it does, however, have more influences than K-pop with regards to the true musicians. Their overseas fans range from 18 years old all the way to 60 for decades\u2019 influences.      Many Chinese in the 80s have already listened to J-pop music like this which will leave them a strong impression. But K-pop so far, since it entered China in 2000, seems to lose their fan base quickly almost every five years after the fans \u201cgrow up\u201d. TVXQ and Super Junior were popular in my generation. But I barely hear anyone who would still listen to K-pop anymore after we graduated from high school. But most of the ex-classmates always seem to know a few Japanese singers and play their songs in the car, since they are interested in music than just \u201cidols\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Before I answered this, I will say that I agree with Ekaterina Louise Kishimoto and Jessica Kim on their assessment, but however there still a lot of detail they didn\u2019t include. I think I can answered this question given that I did enough research on Japan\u2019s music industry. It sad but true that J-pop is not as globally well-known as K-pop. It comes down to accessibility, and also the fact that J-pop\u2019s international fandom is not as united as K-pop fandom. There was a time when J-pop\u2019s international fandom was bigger then K-pop: Are most K-pop fans \"old\" J-pop fans? - Random Remember when a lot Jpop fans were in denial when Kpop was rising in 2000s? - Random International K-Pop fandom 2016 reminds me of Jpop fandom in 2006 - Random J-Pop/Showbiz Male Idol Fan Girls are the WORSE... - The ADRICULOUS Life But somewhere after 2009, J-pop\u2019s international fandom started to mysteriously decline and I can\u2019t explain why that happened. But at the same time, K-pop\u2019s international fandom started to rise and look where we are now. I even seen on some online forum people are asking \u201cwhat happened to J-pop\u2019s international fandom, why did it decline?\u201d, as evidenced here: If K-pop fans are widely accepted in the society, why J-pop fans aren't Where did the j-pop community go? What happened to Jpop community? Why is there a lack of Jpop fans internationally compared to Kpop? - Random Now as I said it comes down to accessibility, compared to K-pop, J-pop\u2019s PV has a lot of restriction and region blocking: Japanese Entertainment 101: Accessibility Answerman - Why is it so tough to buy Japanese digital media downloads? Of course I've tried J-pop! I got to visit Tokyo to cover a concert there, it was amazing! I wish J-pop didn't have so many restrictions tho https://t.co/i94Bz3DnLI\u2014 Jeff Benjamin (@Jeff__Benjamin) June 14, 2017\n Even on Itunes and Spotify, J-pop are hard to find and not every J-pop music are on there for international audiences. Also Itunes in the US don\u2019t have a J-pop category like K-pop has gotten. So that makes it harder for J-pop to get a wider and diverse audiences. It\u2019s no wonder why AKB48 may never get the same type of international popularity on the same level as Girls Generation, Twice, or Blackpink. It\u2019s the same reason why none of Johnny\u2019s boy groups like Johnny\u2019s West won\u2019t get the same type of global recognition like BTS, EXO, or GOT7. The same reason why Namie Amuro, Miliyah Kato, or any Japanese solo singer won\u2019t get any form of popularity in the west compared to lesser well-known K-pop solo singers like Sunmi, Hyuna, Chungha, or Somi. Those name alone can get more international audiences then any J-pop solo act. If you were to put Namie Amuro against Somi in a popularity contest, Somi would win no matter what because K-pop is more well-known in the west then J-pop. Speaking of popularity contest, I\u2019ve mentioned that J-pop\u2019s international fandom is not as united as K-pop\u2019s international fandom, I mean go read this article from AramaJapan and I\u2019ll quote: I\u2019ve noticed here and on other sites people saying that they have no plan to vote for Dempagumi.inc because they don\u2019t like them and / or because they give Japanese music a bad image. But shouldn\u2019t this be something Japanese music fans rally behind? I mean, KPop fans do this all the time. They\u2019ll vote for an act they\u2019re not a fan of simply to further the KPop cause. This is how Big Bang won Best Worldwide Act at the 2011 MTV EMA. This is how Girls\u2019 Generation won Best Music Video at the YouTube Music Awards in 2013. I mean this is true. K-pop fandom is united compared to J-pop. When K-pop MV got blocked on Youtube, K-pop fans in the west raised hell like in the case of Cube artists: K-Pop Fans Raise Hell After Popular Videos Get Blocked on YouTube and BTS: BTS Fans Outraged at Universal Music Group Due To Alleged Unfair Copyright Claims I didn\u2019t see J-pop fans in the west doing the same type of \u201chell-raising\u201d when J-pop MVs got blocked on Youtube, so why didn\u2019t J-pop fandom learn anything from K-pop fanbases? Let me also quote this from the same AramaJapan\u2019s article: I don\u2019t see Japanese music fans doing this. We won\u2019t vote for an act simply because they\u2019re Japanese. But should we change our thinking? Or should we just keep doing what we\u2019re doing? Is voting for something, even though you don\u2019t like it, a good way to further the pushing of Japanese music internationally? People often talk about how Japanese music fans internationally aren\u2019t unified, since there are so many kinds of Japanese music that we consume. What do an Ayumi Hamasaki fan and an ONE OK ROCK fan have in common besides them both being Japanese? What do a Sakanaction fan and an AKB48 fan have in common besides them both being Japanese? But should we get over this thinking? One thing that we\u2019ve tried to do with Arama! Japan since our relaunch from LiveJournal is to be more mindful of the various style of Japanese music, in effort to create more unity. When there is more unity, you learn more things and get different perspectives. Now regarding the part I highlighted in bold and italic, it\u2019s true that Japanese music has diversity, but so does Korean music too!!! I don\u2019t understand how being an AKB48 fans doesn\u2019t prevent you from liking other genre in Japanese music. I\u2019ve seen K-pop branching out to other genre in Korean music like trot and K-rock. Don\u2019t believe me look at this as evidence: K-Indie Now Rides The Hallyu Wave, Gets Wind To Sail Overseas Best of Both Worlds : Korean Pop and Korean Indie | Korean Indie When K-Drama Meets Korean Indie | Korean Indie Dynamic Duo has said it on a interview that K-pop helped their music become more known, and I\u2019ll quote: Kpopstarz: Korean music has been gaining popularity in the United States within recent years. What do you think contributes to the growing international success of Korean hip-hop? Choiza: Starting with idol groups, the physical appearance of the idols, created a synergistic effect in which fans are really thrilled to see how everything is put together so well. Gaeko: These fans start from the idol groups, then become interested in other genres other than K-Pop. That includes K-Hip-Hop and all that good stuff. Choiza: We are shocked by the audience, every time we appear at an event like this one. When we recently went to Europe for our concert, in Paris, we noticed that it wasn't just Korean-French people attending. It was the actual local French people who came to see us. We were really shocked to see the audience composition, demographic. So you see, if K-pop help K hip hop like Dynamic Duo get a lot of western fans, then J-pop should\u2019ve helped unite J-pop and J-rock fandom not divide them. So I don\u2019t understand this divide in J-music fandom when K-pop and K-music fandom are united. Also there seem to be a double standard on how people view J-pop and K-pop, I\u2019ll cite this person\u2019s post from this article:  So yes, people look at AKB48 and similar girl group from Japan like Morning Musume, and C-ute they don\u2019t get accepted by the same people that accepted K-pop despite K-pop having similar concept like WJSN/Cosmic Girls, IOI, Gugudan, Oh My Girl, Momoland\u2026 \u2018Mega\u2019 is new buzzword in K-pop scenehttps://t.co/hG40CED87h#Mega #Kpop #CosmicGirls #NeoCultureTechnology #\uc6b0\uc8fc\uc18c\ub140 pic.twitter.com/KRZlh7OGmE\u2014 Kpop Herald (@Kpop_Herald) February 17, 2016\n I mean go watch Produce 101\u2019s Pick Me video:  and look at AKB48:  A lot of non-K-pop fans chose Produce 101 over AKB48 despite performance and concept being similar. I talked to J-pop fans and they told me \u201cAKB48 is too big to be accepted in the west\u201d, and I asked these same J-pop fans: \u201cThen how did their Korean counterpart like Produce 101 which became IOI, and other big K-pop girl group like WJSN/Cosmic Girls, Oh My Girl got accepted in the west? How did NCT, EXO, Super Junior, and Seventeen got a worldwide audiences despite the huge number of members in the group?\u201d Those same J-pop fans that I asked them that question, they didn\u2019t know and stood silent when I asked them that question. It\u2019s not only girl group, some J-pop fans wonder why older boy group like Super Junior, TVXQ, Shinhwa was able to attract younger K-pop fanbases while older famous J-pop boy groups like Arashi and KAT-TUN couldn\u2019t get the same western audiences that accepted the older K-pop boy group. So it does make one person (like me) wonder why is this certain K-pop group get accepted by western audiences but when J-pop did something similar a few years ago, they don\u2019t get the same type of attention in the west like K-pop has gotten. When I look at people who compared the weirdness factor between J-pop and K-pop, they seem to accept and lean toward K-pop over J-pop. I mean we all know J-pop is weird, but so does K-pop. I mean 2 of Big Bang\u2019s MVs are weird even weirder then any J-pop video we\u2019ve seen:   Girls Generation had a very weird video and that video help them won an award in 2013:   PSY\u2019s Gangnam Style became famous in the west because it was weird. I\u2019ve seen other K-pop MVs that are outright weird:  Crayon Pop ended up touring with Lady Gaga in the US because of this video.   The last 2 video are weird K-pop MVs, and yet they get more western audiences then any weird J-pop MVs. Yet when J-pop does this, they don\u2019t get accepted from the same audiences, so I don\u2019t understand why there is a double standard reception for J-pop and K-pop despite the weird factor being similar. So yes, it doesn\u2019t make sense for J-pop to be less popular then K-pop despite similarity between the 2. As I said, it all comes down to accessibility, and how people view J-pop. This is probably the reason why you will never see J-pop winning awards in the US like their K-pop counterpart, I just saw this today: Congratulations #BTSArmy! You guys are the #BestFanArmy winner #iHeartAwards2018 pic.twitter.com/hhYbaMZUeC\u2014 iHeartRadio (@iHeartRadio) March 12, 2018\n Another big congratulations to @BTS_twt for winning #BestBoyBand at #iHeartAwards2018! This was another really tough battle with lots of excellent nominees. Congrats to everyone who fought for their favorites. @iHeartRadio pic.twitter.com/uW8cF07DgR\u2014 Jeff Benjamin (@Jeff__Benjamin) March 12, 2018\n Don\u2019t expect J-pop to make a leap like that in the US the same way BTS and K-pop are doing. I hope these help. More information: Why Are J-pop global fandom not sharing the same passion like K-pop fandom? Are J-pop fandom not united like K-pop fandom? Why some K-pop fans act so rudely toward J-pop fans and J-pop? ",
