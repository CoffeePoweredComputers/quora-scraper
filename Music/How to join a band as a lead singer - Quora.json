            "answer_text": "Determine what type of music you want to be a singer for, and go to local places where small bands might perform; say a bar, or any small venue. Enjoy the music and search for band that either doesn't have a singer or has a bad one. Talk to this band and make a connection with them. Don't immediately ask to be in the band. You need to be genuine about your friendship before you ask to join something that they built. Post an ad on craigslist, seems corny but I've found lots of random people for random things simply browsing craigslist. Ask any friends or family you have if they know any bands in ____ genre. Try to get their info, listen to their music, and make the connection. Are you young? Good looking? They are not necessary, but it'll help when making those new connections. First impressions carry, so remember that. I guess joining/ creating a band is not going to be the easiest thing to do, but it will be easier than keeping those band mates and being on the same page with them. Think about this\u2026. What do I have to offer to this band. How can I help them? Be sure not to come across condescending or rude because it's likely the band will just assume you're another person trying to hop on their success train. Be valuable and know your worth, and don't stress about it. Keep practicing your vocals and be the best at your craft. Who knows, maybe someone will approach you to join their band. ",

            "answer_text": "Aaaah! Million Dollar question. Few things. Do you sing as of now?Have you ever sang on stage?Do you think you have stage presence and not just a good voice?If not, then start today. Get to a point where you hit the right notes. Best way is to pick a few songs, use the lyrics then karaoke videos on YouTube. Once youre confident, ask around for people to jam with, as performing with a band is very different than singing a song when you can read the lyrics and get visual cues on when to start the next line. You'll need to build an ear for these cues, even a seconds delay can make you sound totally out of sync. Once you've practiced enough, head out and look for bands that need vocalists,be prepared for a lot of rejection and to start small. With that you can then look to bands with bigger audiences. It's hard, but if you're passionate about it, you'll figure your way around it Best of luck! ",
