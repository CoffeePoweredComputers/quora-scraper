            "answer_text": "I usually don\u2019t answer questions that hundreds of people answered before, but I couldn\u2019t help this one. I scanned through as many as I could and yet did not find any of these songs on the list. I did see lots of Rush (we\u2019re going to miss you, Neil Peart), classical music (I could have sworn the question asked for songs, not symphonies) and movie music (just ask yourself, would you like that music if you didn\u2019t like Lord of the Rings or Star Wars?) So without I chose songs that were written by musicians who mostly wrote songs. I\u2019m not sure they\u2019re the greatest, but I really like them.  Europa (Earth's Cry Heaven's Smile) - Santana I\u2019m rather shocked this didn\u2019t make it. This song is from Carlos Santana\u2019s first album after Greg Rolie left to form the band Journey called Amigos. The album is also known because he reduced the Latin influence and went for a more jazz sound.  Masoko Tanga - The Police This is the last song from their first album. I know what you\u2019re thinking, Sting is singing. While some sites actually list lyrics, my untrained ears don\u2019t hear any words that make sense. This is a jam, just something to fill time and sounded good enough to put on the album.  Chitlins Con Carne - Stevie Ray Vaughan This is an instrumental from Vaughan\u2019s last album before his untimely death. He wanted to push in a jazz direction so he channeled a song written by guitarist Kenny Burell. The title translates into \u201cPork with Pork?\u201d Whatever. By the way, music fans, songs without words are also known as instrumentals. ",
