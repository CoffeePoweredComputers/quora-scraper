            "answer_text": "Questions like these are fun little puzzles. There are of course many different ways to modulate from any key to any other key, each evoking different feelings. Here's one nice route from E major to C major I found improvising at the piano earlier: E maj | any E major chord progression here | A maj | D min9 G7 | C maj The modulation happens going from A maj to D min9. The 1st and 5th from A maj, A and E, become the 5th and 9th of D min9, respectively. The idea behind this modulation can be used to modulate to any key, but not all of them will sound smooth. It depends how many notes are shared between the IV chord of the original key, and the ii chord of the target key. Here's another interesting route. This one is a kind of double modulation, with the idea being to use a slight variant of the nice bVI - bVII - I \u201cDuck Tales Theme\u201d approach to the target key instead of the usual V - I approach. E maj | G# min | F min7 Bb7 | C maj This gets to C major by first sort of modulating to Eb major without actually using an Eb tonic chord. Why Eb major? Because its relative minor, C minor, is the parallel minor of the key we're really aiming at, C major. So it sounds very structured and purposeful. I guess I should add that these are only theoretical suggestions, and only the composer of a piece of music can decide what sounds are appropriate to use. But that should go without saying. ",

            "answer_text": "So, the reason its not as satisfying, is the tertiary relationship between the keys. How seamless do you want the transition? Dm - D7 - E would be easy. The note you need to make the E feel good is D#. Second to that would be A resolving to G#. In general, a triumphant, Ta-Da! modulation requires movement by 5ths, which is what they teach in most music schools. Ear musicians are more like to move by scale degree, and use chords outside the key. (bVI, bII, v, iv, etc). Hollywood, Gospel and prog rock guys would do that via either the D#, the A\u2192G#, OR a F\u2192E. By using a common tone modulation. (try going from Ab major to C major) That will not confuse your audience (as long as they have seen a movie scored by John Williams), it will be cause for comment from traditional harmony folks. Do you see any chords that are related? Me neither. C Dm Em G Am Bo E F#m G#m A B C#m D#0 The next most likely route would be the V of either key\u2026. V of C: G Am Bm C D Em F#o V of E: B C#m D#m E F# G#m A#0 Other Routes would use the IV - I relationship\u2026 But I think you really just need to make the bass walk up in measure 4 include a D#. Call it a G+, or go G\u2192G+\u2192B TL;DR: you need to move so far around the circle of fifths that it'd be easier to go across the circle of fifths, and the best way to do that is to use non-diatonic chords like diminished or augmented.
