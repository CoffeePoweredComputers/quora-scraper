            "answer_text": "MAMA is held by Mnet which is a Korean music channel owned by CJ E&M . You must have come across this name quite often . When it comes to popularity MAMA is the biggest award out there . AAA has fallen down in past few years . Every year at least one big artist doesn't attend AAA . On the other hand almost every artist wants to be the part of MAMA although this year has been an exception due to SM and YG entertainment's issues with Mnet . YG artists didn't attend last year too . MAMA and MMA are the first two Kpop award shows that most of the new fans come to know about before GMA or SMA . Melon music awards ( MMA ) and Gaon Music awards (GMA) are probably more relevant since they are more strict with artists' performance in their respective charts while also calculating their album and digital sales . MAMA reaches out to wider audience as they give almost equal preference to international fans' votes . MMA voting is only for Koreans . GMA and SMA are also really popular award shows . Although I would say Korean Music Awards ( KMA ) is the most prestigious award show . It doesn't care about artists' votes , sales and popularity . It's decisions are stricty affected by music critics . Musician of the Year is the Daesang that they give to the Worthy artist irrespective of his/her popularity . It was only in KMA 2018 held in February when a Kpop group was awarded with this daesang . The group was BTS . They also do not hesitate to honor an artist who deserves the award but doesn't attend . So when it comes to popularity and impact on the audience I'll say MAMA and MMA are the biggest but if you only consider music then I'll say it's KMA . If an artist wins at MAMA or MMA then it means he/she is releasing amazing music and is currently a trending artist across the Kpop world and if a Kpop artist wins at KMA that means his/her music is good enough to compete even with non Kpop artists who release tremendous music ",

            "answer_text": "I would say in all honesty that it would be a different award show. A KPop group would more than likely feel proud if they won at the GDA\u2019s (Golden Disc Awards) or GCMA\u2019s (Gaon Chart Music Awards). The reason you ask, well it\u2019s really quite simple. These awards shows don\u2019t have fan voting. So unlike other award shows, these shows have panels and do it off sales for the year, but no fan votes. The GCMA\u2019s have fan voting for one award, it\u2019s a popularity award. MAMA, AAA and SMA all use fan votes to help decide who wins the award, along with a panel and sales, overall, they\u2019re more like a popularity contest. As well as that, MAMA has had some controversies with who won awards, and MNet isn\u2019t the most reliable net work. So from my point of view, if I was an idol, I would want to win at the GDA\u2019s or the GCMA\u2019s simply because I would feel that rather than being acknowledged for my popularity, I\u2019m being acknowledged for the music and work that I put out and that is all a true artist wants from their career, even if it\u2019s only from one person.
