            "answer_text": "Serato DJ's latest Pro and Lite software updates have been in public beta for a couple of months, but today those final versions go live. Included with these updates are the addition of SoundCloud and Tidal streaming services right from your library, which is a big step forward for expanding your repertoire on-the-fly. Tidal streaming also comes with the new Serato DJ update, but as DigitalDJTips notes, you can't currently select this with SoundCloud enabled at the same time. They also mention that Tidal playlist management is supported locally within Serato. These streams can be more beneficial to Sell digital downloads online. SoundCloud's unique roster of artists, pre-release content and selection of new producers listing homegrown tracks makes it a great service for staying on the bleeding edge of what's out there. When SoundCloud is selected in settings and you've signed in, you'll see a folder in your library with all of your existing playlists. Unfortunately, you'll need to use the app to manage them, since Serato doesn't support it locally.  DJ\u2019s music collection is his or her currency: music is, after all, what you\u2019re sharing during a DJ set, and the tunes that you drop form a huge part of your creative expression. Streaming music is a convenient way to consume music, but there\u2019s still nothing like owning a collection of music that you curate, organize, and revisit time and time again. ",
