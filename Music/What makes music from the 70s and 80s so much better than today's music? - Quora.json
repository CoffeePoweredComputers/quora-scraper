            "answer_text": "If we are talking about rock and roll, in my opinion there are lots of reasons: 1. Back in the seventies artists played their music on real instruments. Singers were accompanied by real musicians on real instruments. These artists could and did pour their soul into their music. Today too much of recorded music is developed using computer driven equipment that removes the artist from his music and indeed removes the soul from the music and sterilizes it. An electronic drum track or bass line will never replace the man behind the drums or the bass except as a boring line repeated over and over again ad nauseum. 2. The music business was not driven by the marketing departments of the music industry in those days. Artists developed much of their own work and individual styles and if they were lucky, they got \u201cdiscovered.\u201d Record companies were less afraid to take a chance on a new artist. Some of them resulted in one hit wonders, but a few had music that was accepted with enough popularity by listeners to make them stars. Today\u2019s commercial music is created in the marketing departments of the music industry based on \u201cdata\u201d gathered as to what will sell. As an example, when was the last time you heard a female singer sing anything other than ballads? Same for most male artists and in fact there is so little difference between artists in the commercial music of these days it is hard to tell them apart. This goes back to 2010, but have a listen to Supergirly\u2019s Britani Spears parody: SuperGirly_-_Britney_Spears_parody.flv Also, when did you last hear a current-day song about anything other than love. 3. The demise of vinyl 45 single was a contributing factor as well. In earlier days it was comparatively cheap to record and press a pair of songs (often not even by the same artist) on a 45. If the record was a success then the music company could invest the necessary capital to develop the artist's first album. If the single flopped, well, nothing ventured, nothing gained. 4. Until recently, it was much more difficult to break into the music industry if your music was anything other than that which fit into the marketing template of the music company you were trying to impress. It has always been difficult to \"make it\" in any artistic endeavour, but until recently if you were \"different\" you pretty well had zero chance. Your chances today also improve by how well you look in the video that your music will appear in. Fat ugly people need not apply. Musicians today must be more like models that musicians. Fortunately, this may be changing with the advent of streaming music sites, Youtube and the like. Unknown artists can post music to any number of streaming sites and see what happens. Any number of off-formula artists have been making a decent living selling as independents. 5. Music of the seventies was individualistic and unique. Artists were much freer to explore different directions within their music. Compare early Beatles music with later ones. Look at how people like Eric Clapton evolved over the years. Look at The Grateful Dead. The range of their music is astounding. Original songs and covers crossed musical borders that are pretty well walls in those days. Today music must fit the formula or it will never even get into the recording studio, much less get air time. 6. Much of modern music, such as rap, is as bankrupt as modern art. I will agree that rap is poetry. Some of it is good poetry, but simply reciting poetry with the hip-hop chant to a background of a monotonous drum and bass track is not music any more than throwing a can of paint at a canvas and calling it art is. Fortunately not all of today\u2019s music is bad. But a lot of it is. Maybe it is one of the reasons that my millennial daughter and her husband choose a 1967 Moody Blues song as there first dance song at their wedding. ",

            "answer_text": "It has more to do with the age of the listener than anything else. Think about this subjectively, if you will: music speaks to you about your generation, and most of the music that connects with someone of a certain age also speaks to others of the same age. So, for example, a 16-year old today might not get the symbolism of \u2018putting on my boogie shoes\u2019 but might understand \u2018getting turnt in da club.\u2019 Musicians of a certain era grow with their audience, and thus, are part of the same cultural touchstones, and are able to speak to listeners of those touchstones. A funk act from the 70\u2019s talking about Watergate or the Civil Rights Movement isn\u2019t going to resonate with kids concerned with Black Lives Matter or Trump. Again, different contexts. That doesn\u2019t mean younger people don\u2019t seek out older music - plenty of them do. It also doesn\u2019t mean that older people don\u2019t still look for newer music to enjoy - plenty of them (myself included) do just that. Anyone who tells you music from the 60\u2019s, 70\u2019s, 80\u2019s is better \u2018because people today don\u2019t write real songs\u2019 or just says something like \u2018today\u2019s music sucks\u2019 is only saying that because that person no longer understands the context. Anyone who flat-out proclaims \u2018oh x and y and z suck it was so much better when I was young and in charge of stuff\u2019, is a person you should avoid at all costs. When listening to music, the most important thing is to keep an open mind. Like it, or don\u2019t like it, but I guarantee you, you\u2019ll find something from 2018 that you love, and you\u2019ll find something from 1988 you\u2019ll also love. These may essentially be the same songs, only written from a difference of 30 years of altered perceptions. ",

You had party music for party people. You had blacks Hispanics and whites singing about togetherness. But most of all you had all these singing groups singing about love songs, even solo artist was singing love songs. Remembet smokey Robinson, the dells. Blue magic delfonics , ray goodman and brown, formerly the moments frankie valley captain and taneal Bee Gee's I get metion everybody. But I'm not gonna leave out areatha or Donna summers. But you get the picture. It was all about love EWF. earth wind fire. These days some of the lyrics are to the music is very nasty. I think the entire music industry is corrupt and sadistic along with motion picture industry. I've seen rhe change in some entertainers and their music. I hardly listen to music anymore except for a very few recording. And the music i listen to does not come from the top entertainers of today. Anyway thats my two cent , im not looking for approval from anyone . this is just my opinion. ",

I believe music from the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s was \u201cbetter\u201d because there was more use of live instrumentation and artists were more adventurous sonically. There were more unique voices and more experimentation with different chord changes, progressions, and bridges. Music was also a lot more melodic back then too and the use of melody makes for good music. Also, the songwriting was much more meaningful. Nowadays, it\u2019s more about how \u201ccatchy\u201d a song is versus what the lyrics actually say. ",

For one thing, a lot more people actually _wrote their own songs._ Now, most of the hit songs are either by Max Martin or Lukascz Gottwald. And poetry seems to have gone out of style. So there a lot less lyrical variety as well. They're also compressed to death, with the result that human drummers are made to sound like machines rather than vice versa. And there's much less in the way of dynamics or phrasing. With all of those factors, much-of-a-muchness is not the least bit a surprising result. ",

Record companies also gave artists time and resources to develop. Radio was also a big deal with playlists as opposed to audiences choosing music with streaming it meant a greater variety of music was available for listening. ",

Van Halen , ZZ Top and Michael Jackson worked with MTV because they were already good musically and were able to get videos together ( in the case of MJ a lot of money went into the videos ). As time went on being on MTV was important for sales / exposure so that was a priority over musicality. Hence Milli Vanilli . Granted the same guy behind them was also behind Boney M back in the 70s. What can not be argued is the total lack of song writing and must have albums now compared to the 70s and 80s. Who are the equivalents of Lennon McCartney, Carole King, Becker - Fagen , Frey- Henley , Jagger - Richards etc?? What albums in the last 20 years were must haves like Rumors or Tapestry or Dark Side of the Moon? What artist that started in the mid nineties will have a library of material that will can compare to Led Zeppelin, The Who or The Rolling Stones? The current generation does not value what we valued in the 70s and 80s. ",

As I plod through my 20s, I\u2019ve noticed a strange phenomenon: The music I loved as a teenager means more to me than ever\u2014but with each passing year, the new songs on the radio sound like noisy nonsense. On an objective level, I know this makes no sense. I cannot seriously assert that Ludacris\u2019 \u201cRollout\u201d is artistically superior to Katy Perry\u2019s \u201cRoar,\u201d yet I treasure every second of the former and reject the latter as yelping pablum. If I listen to the Top 10 hits of 2013, I get a headache. If I listen to the Top 10 hits of 2003, I get happy. Why do the songs I heard when I was teenager sound sweeter than anything I listen to as an adult? I\u2019m happy to report that my own failures of discernment as a music critic may not be entirely to blame. In recent years, psychologists and neuroscientists have confirmed that these songs hold disproportionate power over our emotions. And researchers have uncovered evidence that suggests our brains bind us to the music we heard as teenagers more tightly than anything we\u2019ll hear as adults\u2014a connection that doesn\u2019t weaken as we age. Musical nostalgia, in other words, isn\u2019t just a cultural phenomenon: It\u2019s a neuronic command. And no matter how sophisticated our tastes might otherwise grow to be, our brains may stay jammed on those songs we obsessed over during the high drama of adolescence. ",

The \u201880s didn\u2019t have anything new to offer. Who can even remember Flock of Seagulls or George Michael ? Music today is alright. Pretty good as a matter of fact. Depends on what you like. ",

I was born in the early 80\u2019s and music was always a part of my childhood and my parents listened to a lot of 60\u2019s , 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s music.

Of course the music from those years sounds better to you, because they were years of discovery and limited responsibility, and that music was the sound track to the best years of your life. Never mind, you\u2019ve still got the albums. ",
