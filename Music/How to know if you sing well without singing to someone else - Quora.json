            "answer_text": "Never let \u201csomeone else\u201d tell you if you can sing well. If you don\u2019t know that you sing well because that\u2019s what your ears tell you, why do you sing at all? Either you doubt your own ears\u2026which is very possible, or you just want someone else to think you sing well, too\u2026and that\u2019s normal. So, what you need then is an objective opinion on your voice. So record yourself, (download a tuning app to check to see if your pitches are correct) and let someone hear the recording who doesn\u2019t know you, or doesn\u2019t know that it is you singing. They will give you their honest opinion. If it is negative, don\u2019t take it personally, ask them what exactly they didn\u2019t like and let them tell you what you need to work on. ",

            "answer_text": "One way is to pick a song you know well or have at least heard a dozen times. Then sing along with the song as it plays on a \u201cgood\u201d music system. Try to listen to yourself as you sing along. If you sing well, there will be a sort of synchronous and melodious \u2026 over all outcome. If you are out of synch with the singer, try and synchronize as much as you can. Are you able to match the peaks and the troughs of the singer well? In spite of your best efforts if you find yourself straining to match the highs and the lows, you are not a good singer. ",
