            "answer_text": "Some composers define an era (Handel for the Baroque, W.A. Mozart for the Classical, Brahms for the Romantic); others defy strict classification (Beethoven has decidedly Classical moments, especially his early works, while the Eroica Symphony pretty much establishes the beginning of Romantic era). The labels we throw on to a composer\u2019s work are quite arbitrary. That said, Chris\u2019 answer is very sensible and is the common view of the elder Mozart. ",
