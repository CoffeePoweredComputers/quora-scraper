            "answer_text": "I'm very concerned about it.  On one hand, it's becoming so automated, in the sense that mechanical, repetitive patterns and electronic effects mimic the physical automation all around us. Where you can almost see the trees and rivers and sky and clouds in Beethoven or Mozart - or the human angst and spiritual epiphanies in Mahler, there is no comparable expression of naturalism in modern music (correct me if I'm wrong.) And yet we are all still human and capable of such things, aren't we? Another trend is anti-harmonic.  That is, the harmonic sophistication in popular music which reached its zenith (for me) in the early and middle work of Stevie Wonder, (not to mention the Great American Songbook) has been reduced to chant-like chordal repetitiveness and simplification in rap and hip-hop and everywhere else. Then there's the lack of poetic greatness we see in Dylan or Leonard Cohen, Lennon, Bowie, the sophisticated humor of Fagan and Becker, etc.  (Correct me please, because I don't listen to the new stuff much!) As for symphonic music, I consider the orchestra basically an antiquated form (which is OK) because the sonic experience of it has become subservient, on a psychological level, to another art form: the cinema.  I can still be transfixed by a Prokofiev piano concerto, but that's like reading Dostoevsky. It's a wonderful walk through another era of human experience.  (Coltrane on the other hand still produces a solid present-day affect.) I believe, however, that great music comes from great eras and times of social turmoil. Great artists will arise, unquestionably. Maybe there's someone I simply don't know about now. But I deeply hope that the artificiality of music I hear around me is not the future.  It's not about technology. BB King and Jimi Hendrix took an electric instrument and humanized it to express contemporary feelings. Let's see what happens. Addeddum: I've been writing as if there's only Western music. All around the world there's probably great music burgeoning out of other societies where, in fact, greater social turmoil and aspirations for freedom exist! ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s really not possible to say. In 1900 I doubt anyone would have predicted The Beatles or Pink Floyd. In the 1960s it\u2019s highly unlikely anyone would have foreseen Aphex Twin and Autechre. While there will always be music that has an easily traceable evolution while maintaining its own unique style there will also be music which seems so alien to what came before that only those who listen to it extensively and have a knowledge of much of the in between will be able to make any connection. I don\u2019t believe any music is truly doing something which 100% has never been done before but sometimes tracing the path that artists took to get there can be difficult. The one thing I can say with confidence is that whatever it is there will be some that is uninspired and much that is truly creative and interesting. Whether I (or you) would like it is unknown. But I am sure that the age of creativity in music is far from over and likely never will end. ",
