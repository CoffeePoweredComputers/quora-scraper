            "answer_text": "Hearing music when there is no music is not normal. However, having a song \u2018stuck in your head\u2019 is normal. And that usually seems like you are hearing the song, as the tune or lyrics run through the mind. But it\u2019s a different sensation than hearing music that isn\u2019t really there. I\u2019ve never heard music that wasn\u2019t there, but I have heard voices. When I hear a song in my head it isn\u2019t loud and doesn\u2019t seem to come from anywhere. It also tends to get stuck on a certain spot and play a certain bit over and over like a broken record. It\u2019s muted and doesn\u2019t interfere with other things I am actually hearing. When I have heard voices, it seems like it came from somewhere in the room. It sounded like it was to the left or right of me, or in another room. In one instance I almost felt the breath of someone whispering to me on my ear. But no one was there. A hallucination tends to make it seem like things are happening outside of yourself, even though it\u2019s all in your head. For the record, I am not schizophrenic, so I can not say what it is like for people who are schizophrenic. I have just had sleep deprivation induced hallucinations, which are very brief and I am fully aware they are not real. At any rate, hallucinations are not normal. And one should see a doctor about it as soon as possible. ",
