I don\u2019t know if I spelled that right, but I don\u2019t really care. Because your question got me thinking about that beautiful sound. So right now I have to go listen to The Inner Light. It was written by George and it\u2019s beautiful. ",

I believe it is a close relative of the veena, but this latter instrument may be somewhat less versatile (but experts please correct me if this is not so). On the grounds of POTENTIAL, therefore, I will suggest the sitar, and this is certainly the instrument best known in the West. ",

            "answer_text": "Santoor. Its natural tone is vibrational as it is produced by a stroke on the string. The stroke itself is made by a special stick that is balanced on three fingers. The strings are many allowing some intermediate notes easily possible. Thus the sound produced has three variables distance of the strike, pressure applied by the fingers (which can vary within a single note) and which string (and where on its whole length) is struck. It traditionally comes from Kashmir, India and reportedly very difficult to tune as well as to play. ",
