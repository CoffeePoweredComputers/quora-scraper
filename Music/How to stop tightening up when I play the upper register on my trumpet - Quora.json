            "answer_text": "When you\u2019re playing scales, drop the back of your tongue like you\u2019re yawning or swallowing an entire orange. It\u2019s all in the tongue and how it adds/decreases tension to the other muscles of your face. And with the tongue, you can get it out of the way or use to force it more air so you\u2019re not pressing so hard on those high notes. Like circular breathing, but not\u2026 Also exercises like da-da, ta-ta, da-da, ta-ta, da-ta, ta-da, ta-ga, ta-da-ga, ta-da-ga etc. I think may help. The other part is changing the tension against the mouthpiece. It\u2019s easier to demonstrate in a larger size instrument, but explore playing to the top and to the bottom of the mouth piece. You may find that with your anatomy, it might be easier to change the angle of the trumpet to your face for the high notes. ",

            "answer_text": "(A2A) Playing high notes is complicated. Try this: You need lots of air: a solid column, created by sitting (or standing) up straight, with no tension in your shoulders. A strong column of air will help you do that 2-octave scale without changing your chops partway up.start low, with high chops. By that, I mean prep for high chops, then place the mouthpiece on your chops and play a low (not pedal) C. If you can\u2019t get a note out, take the mouthpiece off, and prep again, but with the chops being a little less \u201chigh.\u201d Find the best \u201chigh chops\u201d that will let you play a good low C. Later, when doing pedals, you might need to relax again and find a good setup for the wider range.by \u201chigh chops,\u201d I mean prep with the lips pressing together (not too hard!) and in towards the center, but also curling back towards the teeth slightly. This PETE thing trains that action, and no, I don\u2019t work for them. P.E.T.E. - Personal Embouchure Training ExerciserUse the C to C two-octave scale as a way of training your chops to stay mostly the same as you go up. What changes is the amount of air you have to push through your chops, and the firmness of the lip-to-lip pressure (and backwards curl) that you have to increase slightly as you play higher and reduce the size of the vibration area. As you push more air, the air will try to separate your lips, so your job is to keep them together.I really avoid pressing the horn harder into the chops, and try to keep the mental image of the guy blowing high notes into a horn hanging on a string (no pressure). Was that Maynard? I don\u2019t know. Anyway, I see the chops setup as existing largely independently of any horn-to-chops pressure.The inside-the-embouchure means of dealing with the higher notes is different at each register. I\u2019ve found that the tongue only comes into play at the top of the staff and above, but your mileage may vary.above high C, every change inside your mouth just gets finer and finer. You might be overdoing the tightness, so maybe you need to learn how to control the firmness in finer increments.my mental image is of a tiny invisible sphere in the center of the lips vibrating, and as I go higher, I make the sphere smaller in three dimensions, eventually pushing it slightly forward with the tongue above high C. It\u2019s just an image that helps me set up.That\u2019s all I got, it works for me right now, and hope some of it makes sense. Good luck! ",
