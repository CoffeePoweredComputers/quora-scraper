They like all the members equally and even though you have a BIAS (liking a member more but you still like the other members) that's ok you're still considered a blink but you only like 3/2/1 member then your not a blink. Blinks who like all the members (even with a bias) are called true blinks! here there are two blinks- international and Korean. this not only for blackpink but for all the kpop groups in general. ",
