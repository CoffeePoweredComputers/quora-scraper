            "answer_text": "Types of Drum Brakes:- 1. Leading/Trailing Shoe type: Leading shoe is the one that is present in the direction of rotation of drum .The one on other side is trailing shoe. The leading shoe is dragged into the friction surface of the drum for achieving braking force. Trailing shoe is dragged away from friction surface, thus not contributing in the braking. It is equally effective in forward and reverse braking. Generally used in rear wheels of passenger automobiles.  2. Twin leading shoe: there are two leading shoes. One shoe has self-servo effect. So it provides maximum braking force as both shoes provide friction to the drum. Used in Trucks and other commercial vehicles.  3. Duo Servo: Duo-servo type drum brakes are an improved version of twin leading construction, where two brake shoes are linked. When a primary side leading shoe is pressed against the drum by the wheel cylinder, the force that makes it rotate together with the drum wedges the secondary side leading shoe into the drum to achieve braking action. It is used in commercial vehicles requiring large braking forces.  ",
