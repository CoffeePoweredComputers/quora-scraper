            "answer_text": "It depends on how good their performance is during their trainee years. They have intense training in rap, vocals and dance. If their performance and ability is high enough, they will be added into the debut team. Usually, the company will find trainees that are good in all aspects, or trainees that excels in one specific position. Within the debut group, the members are also separated into Main and Lead rappers, dancers and vocalists. Usually, the main vocalist is in charge of high notes and most singing parts. The lead vocalist usually sings the parts before the main vocalist or opens up the song (from what I see personally). They can have similar vocal abilities, but it\u2019s about the tone color and other means. For main rappers, they usually have the major part of the rap in the songs. Lead rappers will also rap in the song, but probably their skills and flows aren\u2019t as good as the main rapper. Sometimes they won\u2019t have a rap part, depending on the genre of the song. For main dancers, they usually have the best dance skills / performances on stage. I find most main dancers with a decent stage presence as well. They are usually the centre during dance breaks or have solo dance parts in the choreo. The lead dancer also dance pretty decently but probably not as performative than the main dancer. They also stand pretty front during dance breaks. Centre is chosen by the company. I find most centres pretty good in every aspect, and they are in charge of leading the choreo during choruses, and you can find them always standing near the middle. A member can have multiple positions, depending on their role and ability in the group. Take Taeyong from NCT as an example. He is the Leader, Main Rapper, Main Dancer, Sub Vocalist, Visual, Center at the same time. So, these positions depend on the performances of the members during predebut. That\u2019s it. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on the standards of the company, i\u2019ll only talk about vocals since it\u2019s the most i\u2019m interested at. Like i said it also depends on the standards of the company. 90% of SM main vocalists were already above average-proficient when they debuted. Also followed by their good scouting system. Lead vocalists have to be at least average or so. While other companies choose their main vocalist based on the tone of their voice or the notes that they hit (most high notes are probably strained and underdeveloped). Sometimes main vocalists are just there for the sake of having one, same for the lead as well. I wanted to be more detailed about it but i\u2019ll just keep it short for now. ",
