            "answer_text": "The Beatles recorded thirteen studio albums, if we count Yellow Submarine (half of it is soundtrack music for the film, by George Martin) and Magical Mystery Tour (released an an EP in the UK and double EP in the US - the latter version being how it's released nowadays) as full albums:  Please Please Me (1963)With The Beatles (1963)A Hard Day's Night (1964)Beatles For Sale (1964)Help! (1965)Rubber Soul (1965)Revolver (1966)Sgt. Pepper (1967)Magical Mystery Tour (1967)The Beatles (1968)Yellow Submarine (1968)Abbey Road (1969)Let It Be (1970)Two more points: It's incredible to note that in 1964 and 1965, The Beatles wrote, recorded and released two studio albums and two singles (with a proper b-side), made a film, and toured extensively. Can't imagine anyone working like that nowadays.Their US label Capitol diced and sliced their early albums, giving an average nine tracks to the UK's twelve to squeeze more cash out the Beatle moneypit, with Sgt Pepper the first to be identically released. Since the albums' release on CD in 1988, the albums have reverted to the UK versions.",
