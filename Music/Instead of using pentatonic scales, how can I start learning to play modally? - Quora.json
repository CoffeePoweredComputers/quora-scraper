            "answer_text": "Start by playing G Mixolydian. Its the same notes as C Major / A minor, however G will be the prominent note and F will be the Mixolydian note. The note that gives it the mixolydian sound not the G major sound. Noodle around letting your open 3rd string drone on like a pedal. Get that mixolydian sound in your ears. Just as we have scale patterns for our guitar, we have patterns for modes. So, use your knowledge of the scale of C major and all the patterns you know on your guitar in C Major, and play the mixolydian mode instead. Welcome to modes. ",
