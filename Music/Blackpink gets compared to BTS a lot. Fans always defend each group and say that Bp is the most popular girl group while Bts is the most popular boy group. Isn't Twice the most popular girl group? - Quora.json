            "answer_text": "Nope blackpink is popular, a year ago you could argue that no blackpink is less popular in Korea and Twice more popular. Blackpink is more popular internationally. Not anymore. But real facts based on ranks in the recent band reputation ranks or individual ranks, blackpink ranks much higher than in the past. Lots of things can be said that no it because of promotions and other groups don't have as much, the fact that a promotion can beat boy groups such as Bts speaks for itself. Now Twice I may not be totally keep track of them, but what I do know is the members are becoming less talked about Sana of course with her beauty is making waves in Korea. But remember when they all used to be at least in top 10 in brand ranks. Now we look at billboard for Korea, or billboard 200. I will use billboard 200 Twice has entered the billboard 200 well done girls, with more and more. Blackpink let's not go there to long.(They have entered highest is 13 with Ice cream) Now where do they end up in music charts in Korea. Both groups did well but surprisingly Blackpink did extra well I was shocked and confused lol. How you like that ultimately can be Soty and the album Aoty in terms of sales or charting even influence Blackpink wins with just Ice cream and How you like that. Now this is something I want to say you can't compare Korea to international, international is everywhere besides Korea. And even if blackpink isn't popular in country a member probably is. Looking at tweets I jugbe from there. The president of South Korea has mentioned Lisa to be the link to China, Korea and Thailand, that is huge, because people agree. She honestly came a long way I think even Korea can't deny her power. The members individually popularity could beat twice as a group in popularity. In conclusion Blackpink is the revolution. ",

            "answer_text": "Nope. Sorry to disappoint you but TWICE isn't a popular girl group worldwide. Being popular doesn't directly means that the group is successful or the best. TWICE is actually more popular in Japan and South Korea. By more popular I mean that most of their fans are crowded in these countries. But, TWICE isn't really popular in US or other countries like BTS or BP is. In SK, they are the #1 gg right now. Even, BP has worldwide popularity than them, but TWICE holds the position. And TWICE is actually more successful than BP. Promotion also plays an important role. If you look closely, JYP never focused on promoting TWICE in Western Music Market like they are doing with ITZY. Whereas, YG and BH(though never clearly said) wanted to promote them in Western Market when they saw a rise in their international fandom. Preference is another part. Some people don't prefer cute concepts. I was sceptical that I would even like cute concepts. But, TWICE changed my view. BP's girl crush concept actually looked normal to me and I used to cringe at TWICE's cute concepts. I would think that being cute is actually what dumb girls do. (SORRY TWICE\ud83d\ude2d, I LOVE YOU) So, ignorance among some people is also a reason why TWICE doesn't garner worldwide popularity like BP and BTS. But, as I said earlier popularity only means external validation. Just look at BTS. Were they really popular up till 2015? They actually blew up when Wings dropped. Before 2015, they were actually titled as Nugu group. Just imagine you were one of their fans who knew them at that time. You felt the same that they should be more popular, their music is so good, they rightfully deserve their awards even what bs the antis spread about them. I am not trying to undermine any group. When we like a group, which is somewhat less popular than the other group we feel like it should replace the top spot held by the other group. We feel like it is because of the popular group which is why our bias group is overshadowed. Let's take GFRIEND. They are less popular than Twice and BP. I love GFRIEND for their music. I used to feel they should at least make a space in top 3 gg. But did it happen? No. Now GFRIEND's contract is ending in 2021. I don't really care about their popularity now. I think Song of Sirens (their latest album) should have deserved more than it got. Still, I like them, and don't consider popularity a hindrance to not love them. I love them for their musical element which sets them apart from top popular GG's.  Smaller Quorans have less exposure than popular Quorans. Some smaller Quorans with less followers have really nice and informative answers but get less upvotes and views. But they don't really stop writing at all. It's the similar case. So being less popular doesn't automatically means less capabilities. It's just that they have less exposure than popular groups. But the people who stan them love and support them like any other group. Even less in number but they are basically the loyal ones. ",
