            "answer_text": "Are ignition coils interchangeable? Absolutely not. And what kind of ignition coil are you specifically referring to? Automotive? Small engine? So to limit the answer I will only mention the old \u2018soda can\u2019 style automotive ignition coils. Some were designed to work on 10 volts instead of 12 volts due to the lower voltage during starting. There is a ballast resistor to lower the voltage during normal operation that is bypassed during the starting. Other ignition coils of a similar size and shape were designed for electronic ignition with a CDI (Capacitive Discharge Ignition) system that is designed for 12 volts and does not use a ballast resistor. Currently most all automotive ignition coils are application-specific and are not interchangeable from one manufacturer to another. If you are asking about a different type or use of an ignition coil then repost the question with the specifics. 12\u201331\u20132019. ",
