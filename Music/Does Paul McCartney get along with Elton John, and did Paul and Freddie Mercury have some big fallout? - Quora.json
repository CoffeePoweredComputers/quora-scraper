            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know about Paul and Elton but another answer made me curious about Paul and Freddie. How could I have not known about this? Paul wanted to do a duet with Freddie sometime between Live Aid (\u201885) when they got to know each other better and 1987 when Paul finally recorded it alone because Freddie was too busy? Can\u2019t imagine Freddie missing a chance to work with Paul! Maybe that\u2019s where the question about a falling out comes from. But this is not mentioned in ANY of the biographies I\u2019ve read on Freddie. Does anyone have any source for this outside of Wikipedia? An interview with Paul, perhaps? Please comment. This is from Wikipedia: \u201cOriginally it was intended that this song would be a duet between McCartney and Freddie Mercury. The two had known each other only casually: Mercury was a fan of Buddy Holly and would occasionally attend McCartney's Holly inspired events over the years. However, they became friends properly following socializing that took place after Live Aid. McCartney (who had a lot of sympathy for Mercury due to the press stalking him for stories about his health) wrote the song with Mercury in mind. Mercury however was inundated with work, both solo and with Queen, and McCartney continued the project without him. However McCartney's pitch, phrasing and key on the finished track are all very similar to the guide vocal demo he created for Mercury when he was attached to the project. Linda McCartney revealed that Paul was devastated by Mercury's death when she appeared alone on British TV a few days after Mercury died. The track was recorded at Hog Hill Studio on March 11 and 12, 1987 with overdubs added in Abbey Road in July.\u201d [2] Many have complained that during the finale sing-a-long of Live Aid Bono and Paul froze Freddie out not letting him share the mic but if you look closely the mic was stretched to the max during part of the song and even Paul had to turn toward Bono to sing into it. Also, Paul puts his arm around Freddie\u2019s waist at the end. Just wanted to throw this in because of the angst on social media. Lol. Here\u2019s the song.  Updated to include a drawing that Freddie did as a teenager of Paul McCartney who he looked up to.  ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know if Paul McCartney got along with Elton John. But I will take a jab at this question anyhow. I think that yes, he did. Elton got on well with just about all of the Beatles, including John whom he got on well with the most, because that relationship has been documented. I don\u2019t know about the second half of the question, though. Freddie Mercury was a leading member of Queen. Paul may or may not have had somewhat of a distant acquaintanceship with him. I never got that far into McCartney\u2019s social life outside of his own inner circle of friends and acquaintances. ",
