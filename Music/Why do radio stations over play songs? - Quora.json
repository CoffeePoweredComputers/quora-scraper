            "answer_text": "The primary reason is that the less popular and/or familiar a song is, the more likely it is that you will tune away. Thus radio programmers try to limit the number of unfamiliar and unpopular pieces of music aired. This is true across every radio format, although the particulars will differ from station to station and from format to format. For much of my career, I have overseen and conducted research music research for radio stations I have been associated with, and for over 30 years, the patterns have been relatively consistent. For stations playing mostly current music, there might be only a couple dozen songs that are truly popular among a majority of listeners in any given week. For stations playing mostly older music (which I'll define arbitrarily as music at least a year old or older), there might be a few hundred titles that are popular and familiar enough to be reliable. What we want to try to insure is that when you tune in, you are more likely than not to find something you know and, at least to some extent, like. And we want to make sure that if we do play something you don't know that it's surrounded by songs you do know. We also know that tolerance for repetition tends to increase if the songs in question are popular. There is a story told about Todd Storz, one of the pioneers of music programming. It is said that Storz and his friends were drinking in a bar sometime back in the 1950s and noticed that people tended to play the same songs on the jukebox over and over again, giving Storz the insight that for many people, repetition of songs is a positive, not a negative, at least for awhile. Eventually, however, many songs lose their appeal as people get tired of them. So we not only keep track of familiarity and popularity, but also what we in the biz call \"burn,\" the percentage of potential audience members who are tired of hearing the song. In the end, most current songs eventually end up being retired. When was the last time you heard, say, \"The Macarena\" on any station? Some return at lower rotations after their run at the top. That happens with many, if not most big hits. Some seem to never get old to most people, at least as long as their most devoted partisans remain in the station's target demographic. For example, I have never seen a music research test of male classic rock fans who came of age in the 1970s or early 1980s in which \"Sweet Home Alabama\" was not in the top 10%, even though it's been played gazillions of times since it came out in 1974. \"Sweet Home Alabama\" will eventually leave the Classic Rock format, but only after a couple of generations of rock listeners age out of the format's target demo.

            "answer_text": "commercial radio stations (those that sell advertising) want the largest possible listening audience at any given time. there are (at least) two (major) schools of thought for how to do that. (1) have the largest possible number of people tune in for a while (cume or \u201ccumelative\u201d audience), even if that while is relatively short periods of time, or (2) have a smaller audience but keep them tuned in longer. (higher \u201cAQH\u201d or Average Quarter Hour). Those subscribing to theory 1, cume building, tend to go with the theory that at any given time they should be playing the very best song possible so if someone tunes in with no particular station or mood in mind most likely they will love the song that is on right now and stay tuned to hear the whole song and others like it that follow. Those subscribing to theory 2, AQH building, tend to go with the theory that a lot of people are tired of the same old songs being repeated so they still want popular songs but tend to go a little deeper down the charts so more people will say \u201coh wow! I love that song but haven\u2019t heard it in a while. 3. Of course, stations tend to blend the two theories, with the first in times of shorter listening such as drive times in the car to and from work, and the second during the office hours (promoting \u201cno repeat\u201d workdays and the like) and in the evening. Many successful radio stations, particularly in larger cities with bigger budgets, do audience research about listener opinions. Some hire research organizations to do \u201cauditorium testing\u201d where song excerpts are played and listeners write down (or sometimes push buttons 1\u20135 for don\u2019t like on to really like a lot) and song scores are tabulated. You would be surprised that if you quantitatively track song sales or downloads, the top 5\u201310 songs sell many, many times more songs than perhaps #20\u201330 on the charts, which may be thousands of times more copies sold than an oldie or greatest hits compilation. Also, if 20\u201330 second excerpts of 200\u2013300 songs are tested, at least half will not get good \u201cI like it\u201d scores. Some stations replace or augment \u201cauditorium tests\u201d (sometimes also done in small meeting rooms in malls or non-meal times in restaurants) with call-out telephone research. The particular people chosen can impact results, depending on if a researched person likes the station or the type of music, so usually qualifications are placed and people who hate rock or country or rap or oldies would not be tested by a station that is going to play that type of music.
