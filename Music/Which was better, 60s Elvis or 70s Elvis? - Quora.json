            "answer_text": "Music wise it was probably the \u201850\u2019s and \u201860\u2019s. With the early 70\u2019s being his best of that decade. Not quite as good from \u201874\u2019 - \u201877 because the drugs had really taken a hold of his life by then. He made great music up until his death in 1977, but 1956\u20131973 was his best work. The \u201860\u2019s were strange because he had to do all those movies that Colonel Parker contracted him into up till 1968. So he did a lot of subpar silly songs for those movies. When he could have been concentrating on top notch songs during the \u201860\u2019s. Then Colonel Parker had him do that Las Vegas residency for years. Elvis should have NEVER signed with that clown of a manager to run his career. He took 50% of everything Elvis made. Elvis was the biggest star on the planet at that time, he should have been a little patient and signed with a manager for 10\u201315%. He was such a good southern boy, he was raised to follow through with a deal no matter what the cost. Sadly the grind of his schedule cost him his life at 42 because of using drugs to help cope with it. And Colonel Parker was well aware of the drug problem, but he only cared about the bottom line-MONEY! He has so many great songs, but everyone reading this should listen to \u201cAnything that\u2019s part of you\u201d. His voice is so perfect in that song. Another one that gives me chills is his version of \u201cAmerican Trilogy\u201d from the Hawaii 1973 special. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A. Looking at things strictly in terms of chart history, 60s Elvis was better. Elvis Presley\u2019s released 29 albums between 1960 and 1969. Of these, 14 of them were in the top ten for Billboard\u2019s top 200 albums charts, including 4 times in the #1 position. In contrast to this, between 1970 and 1976, Elvis released 42 albums of which only one, 1973\u2019s Aloha from Hawaii via Satellite, made the top 10, but impressively at the number one position. The bulk of Elvis\u2019s new albums during this time was live recordings and reissues. Clearly Elvis\u2019s more creative days were behind him throughout the 1970s and up until his 1977 passing. All Billboard chart data for this answer was referenced from List of Elvis Presley hit albums - Wikipedia (Note: Although Elvis released his last studio album, Moody Blue, in the year 1977, I am deliberately omitting this from consideration since sales of this album were likely bolstered owing to his death. In fairness, however, I will note that the title track for this album was a number one single on the country music chart about five months prior to Elvis\u2019s death later in the year) ",
