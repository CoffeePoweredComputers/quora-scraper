            "answer_text": "Hmmm\u2026 I never really gave it much thought. Let\u2019s see, what would be the soundtrack to describe good ol\u2019 Razz: Alice Cooper - Your Own Worst EnemyI guess the title alone describes me pretty good, the lyrics are full of examples how the main character sabotages his own life. I guess you could call that song my inofficial hymn.Queen - Fat Bottomed GirlsNot only does this song a good job to describe the type of woman I am, but also the type of woman I like.Steel Panther - Fuck Everybody / Alice Cooper - It\u2019s The Little ThingsYeah, sometimes this world just drives me mad.The Clash - I\u2019m not downI've been through a lot in my life but there\u2019s always something that keeps me from staying down for too long, even if it\u2019s mostly just that I just don\u2019t want to grant all those assholes the satisfaction of winning.Babymetal - Gimme ChocolateWhat can I say? I just like candy.Alice Cooper - Might As Well Be On MarsThe story of my whole love life. People I like just can\u2019t see me.The Darkness - Last Of Our KindThis is how I often feel when people talk about movies, music and other stuff and most of the ones I like are from times before I was even born.The Darkness - Heavy Metal LoverI mean, there\u2019s not much in this playlist that doesn\u2019t feature at least some more or less heavily distorted guitars, is there?",
