            "answer_text": "Generally symphonies have numbers not names, since in the main (at least during the classical and early romantic eras) they are abstract rather than programmatic pieces of music. But for various reasons certain symphonies are given names or subtitles by the composer or the publisher, or come into common use after comments and reviews, etc. Today, three of Beethoven's 9 symphonies are commonly given names: the 3rd Eroica or \"heroic\" symphony, the 6th Pastorale symphony and the 9th Choral symphony.  The reasons for these names are simply that the 3rd is \"heroic\" in nature and Beethoven was going to dedicate it to Napoleon before the latter decided to call himself Emperor and invade other countries, the 6th is full of the pastoral sounds of the countryside, and the 9th has voices in the last movement. Other Beethoven symphonies are sometimes given names, but their usage is less common. Perhaps it is no coincidence that symphonies with names tend to be more popular than those without names (though not always), although cause & effect are not clear! ",

Those are the \"Eroica\" (3rd Symphony), the \"Pastorale\" (6th Symphony) and the \"Choral\" Symphony, the 9th.The \"Apotheosis of Dance\" name was given by Richard Wagner when talking about Beethoven's 7th Symphony, because of its rhythmic qualities. \"The Little Symphony\" was an affectionate name Beethoven gave to his 8th Symphony (\"my little symphony in F\") when comparing it to his 6th, since both symphonies were written in the key of F Major (and are the only two that share a key).
