            "answer_text": "Oh boy, I feel like I'm going to get a lot of hate for this post. As a disclaimer, all these celebrities are much better looking than I am and I'm sure most are lovely people. Aishwarya Rai, Actor  Before joining Quora I never once heard of Aishwarya. Almost everytime I am on Quora I see her photo pop up as \u2018the most beautiful woman.\u2019 She's certainly pretty and unique looking but I would say she looks a bit strange. To be honest I think a huge part of why she's hailed as beautiful in India is because of her blue eyes and pale skin. Alexandra Daddario, Actor  I definitely think she's pretty and from interviews she seems like a nice person. I have seen and heard so many men gush over her and I don't understand why. She's definitely prettier than the average girl but I think a lot of men are very focused on her bright, blue eyes. Like Alexandra I also have dark hair, pale skin and blue eyes but I'm nowhere near as pretty. Kylie Jenner, Reality TV Star  I think Kylie was much prettier before all the surgeries. She is very good at posing for photos and she knows her angles but candid shots betray her. I am the same age as her but the surgeries have made her look at least ten years older than me. I feel sad that someone so young would get lip fillers, cheek fillers and a brow lift. The surgeries to her body also make her look out of proportion. Her face and body look good on Instagram but strange anywhere else. Tom Hiddleston, Actor  He seems like a nice guy but I don't see why a lot of girls are attracted to him. Cara Delevigne, Model  I've never understood the obsession with Cara. She has a very unique face but I don't understand the hype. My best friend is obsessed with her and told me Cara Delevigne is the only woman she'd go lesbian for. Benedict Cumberbatch, Actor  Again, nice guy but I find him a bit freaky looking. In case you're wondering, my celebrity doppelganger is actor Felicity Jones:  I look a lot like her except I don't have a fringe and my eyes are blue. My hair is a darker shade of brown. I like to wear it up because it bothers me when it's in my face. I'm definitely more attracted to people with tanned, olive and dark skin with brown or black eyes. It's very difficult to find colours that don't wash you out when you're so pale. I also think that darker skin shows muscle tone better, making you look more toned and athletic. ",

My own wife thinks he\u2019s cute.  If by \u201ccute\u201d she means \u201cthe man looks like Javier Bardem and Jared Leto got high on angel dust and made a baby out of recycled tattoo ink, raw sewage, and the shattered anti-capitalist dreams of every hipster in Glendale,\u201d then yes, he\u2019s cute. To me, the guy looks like every dorkwad I ever went to high school with. His nose and his chin are the same length. His eyes are too large for his face, and sunk so far back into his skull that he\u2019d put a Neanderthal to shame. His eyebrows are thicker than a werewolf\u2019s fingers, and about the same shape. His toad-like mouth is curled up into this idiotic little grin, the kind that R. Lee Ermey chokes off of Gomer Pyle\u2019s face in Full Metal Jacket. And let\u2019s not even talk about that freaking fivehead. Christ, the man\u2019s flashing more cranium-skin than Mohandas K. Gandhi. Without a beard, he looks like a douchebag.  With a beard, he looks like a bum.  With a beard and sunglasses, he\u2019s fairly passable.  Without a beard and sunglasses, I just want to put him in a headlock and noogie him until I drill through his skull and put him out of my misery.  Ack! Begone, you greasy-haired, wall-eyed hobbit wannabe! ",
