            "answer_text": "Your mom probably knows the grade itself is not that important. She\u2019s likely worried that her kid isn\u2019t learning the bigger lesson of work ethic. When we have jobs, there are a lot of times that we work on a small task that doesn\u2019t seem very important at the time. If we don\u2019t do that small task once, no big deal. Make it up. When we start ignoring the small tasks over and over, they start to pile up and become a problem. There would be no problem if the tasks were handled. Sometimes, when we get used to ignoring the smaller tasks, it becomes harder to do the bigger tasks. When we mess up on a bigger task, our coworkers won\u2019t trust us as much. We won\u2019t be offered as many opportunities. In some cases, we might get fired. So how do you say you\u2019re sorry? Actions speak louder than words. If a smoker tells you they\u2019re going to quit smoking, and buys a pack three days later, do you trust their word or their actions? The only way to apologize from the bottom of your heart is to take action and finish your schoolwork :) ",

            "answer_text": "A little bad grade now and then doesn't matter too much . The teacher who is organised , will give a syllabus at the start of the class , and some assignments are weighted more than others . And there will be assignments along the way to get to the larger more important assignments . The actual grade is not as important as whether you are learning the material . Often , the way we learn is by making mistakes . Maybe you need to study a bit more . If you are falling behind in class , there usually are free tutoring services from other more advanced students , and you may be access those by asking your teacher , a school academic counselor , or the school library staff . Just tell your mom that you got a bad grade , and you are trying to find out if you can get some tutoring , and ask for her help and encouragement . ",
