            "answer_text": "Since you are moving into an apartment, the last choice for you should be a grand piano. I would suggest you to get a digital piano rather than an acoustic one, because a digital piano is more portable than a real piano and therefore can be transported with ease into your apartment . (I am not sure how big the space of your apartment is, but I assume that it would be much harder to move a grand piano into your place). You may not have time to practice during daytime, so the volume control features of a digital piano would definitely be appealing to you. Practice without worrying about disturbing your neighbors! As you and playback features of a digital piano would also be helpful , since it allows you to identify the mistakes you have made. \u2022 Yamaha is one of my favorite brands. They make beautiful digital pianos and offer a variety of price values. You can choose from CLP or CVP series, CLP allows you to Experience the sound, keyboard touch and pedal feel of a grand piano and provides you the Essential features for practicing traditional piano music, and CVP allows you to be the band leader or orchestra conductor for full ensemble performance. I guess CLP line would fit you more. Here is the website of the Clavinova piano line: Clavinova - Digital Pianos - Yamaha - Other European Countries ",

            "answer_text": "According to your budget (high to low)you should consider the following:\u2014 If you are completely into music you can consider buying the Grand Piano which is damn expensive and requires maintenance every 6\u20137 months. This is a good but only if you need to perform in concerts or are making videos. Next I'd say you could go in for a Baby Grand piano, which is just as beautiful and loud and is affordable too but you still need to keep up with the maintenance costs.( Every 6 months) If you're thinking small you could consider a vertical grand piano which is next down the ladder if cost and also takes up less space and can be placed along a wall. You're gonna have to inquired about the maintenance as I am not waste of it. Ideal for those who are accustomed to play the piano but are not into concerts and musical events. The one I consider best for pianists is an electronic grand piano which is quite affordable and almost as absolutely awesome as a grand piano. It has weighted keys and sound almost identical to that iof the grand.Go in for that Yamaha Clavinova series. I got the very same piano and I love it. Hope this helps Cheers ",
