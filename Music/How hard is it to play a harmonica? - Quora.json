            "answer_text": "The learning curve for the harmonica is pretty interesting. Compared to many other instruments it starts pretty easy, but then suddenly ramps up quite a bit. Everyone who can breathe can get a sound out of the harmonica. And the sounds they are getting will probably be in the key of the harmonica. It\u2019s hard to play a wrong note that way. However, playing the right note, without playing unintended notes \u2026 that\u2019s a different matter. Playing single notes takes a bit of practice. Still, not all that hard. Then, you learn to play in different positions. That\u2019s essential for playing blues or minor songs. Suddenly there are notes you really need to avoid. Then, you need to learn bending draw notes on the lower end of the harmonica, and blow notes on the higher end. That gives you some notes outside of the standard major scale of the harmonica. This is tricky, since the technique that works best will for you will depend on the shape of your mouth and tongue. Also, a teacher cannot just show you the inside of their mouth while they are playing. Then, learning to play fast without running out of breath, learning chords and octave splits, \u2026 The main thing about the harmonica is that it gives you a lot of limitations on notes you can play, and on notes you can play together. Not all combinations of two notes can be played at the same time, but some can. That means that you\u2019ll need to understand some music theory, so you can figure out how to make up for what you cannot do without it sounding bad. It\u2019s a fascinating instrument. One of the key things that make the harmonica easier to learn: you can carry one with you at all times. I do. I always have a few harmonicas in my pocket. When waiting for the bus, or waiting for friends to arrive, I can just sit down and get 5 minutes of practice. Try doing that with a piano! ",

            "answer_text": "Learning the harmonica is pretty fun and interesting. I've been able to play the harmonica for over a year now and took me about 1/2 year to catch on to the instrument. It is fairly easy and sounds awesome. I recommend getting a A flat or a B flat. These have absolutely the best sound.Now I'm playing the guitar and the harmonica at the same time which is a bit trickier. First you have to learn both of them separate, and then slowly start to learn them together which is HARD. You must keep in mind the the further you go right on the mouthpiece, the higher the sound will go. Yes the harmonica is an easy instrument to play if you get the hang of it, just like any other. My sister just does not get the hang of playing the harmonica and is not yet able to play it, but already practiced very hard and I tried to give her lessons but she just does not follow me. This instrument is hard to Master, and has a lovely curve to it. Some people say that they need more air for some songs and cannot play that song, but as for me, I don't have that problem. I hope this answers your question and wish you many days+years of true success. Learning and playing the harmonica is not hard, intact it's fairly easy. ",
