            "answer_text": "I had promised myself I would not answer another Beatles question on here, because of the shear anger I feel, both for questions and answers. Yet if I do not, a huge part of my musical beliefs will disappear to bloody stupidity. Firstly, what does better mean? John Lennon used a guitar to express his musical and lyrical ideas, as an artist used a pencil, paint brush, sculpture a chisel. Does anyone ask who was better at using a pencil? George was part of the Band to put another guitar part in, to animate, help those ideas. Each got paid according to their work, creating Songs, is regarded as the most important work, as it is not COPYING other people's work. Very few musicians can ever say they wrote as a partnership, 220 best collection of songs, still without equal, in the history of music. George Harrison could not say that, nor Ringo, nor George Martin, only Lennon and McCartney can, which is why we still love the Beatles. For me, John was more experimental than McCartney. As a songwriter, he made great original music that simply cannot be explained. Lennon's answer was simple, he knew nothing about music, so it was a blank piece of paper. Yes, he listened, but to be quite frank, I wish he hadn't, because his own head produced better stuff than anyone else, could ever write. I am also a great Dylan fan, and Dylan will go down as the greatest songwriter, because of the length of time he has been writing. McCartney will be better remembered in the partnership for the same reason, but McCartney never wrote as well later as he did in the Beatles. Now, trying to be nice and polite, to the question: John and George's collective guitar sound was special, because it was that which carried the sound of the Beatles making them special. Often, one mic was placed between the two amps of each guitarist, to use only one track, because recording studios were in their infancy. Keith Richards, of the Rolling Stones, said George's guitar sound was \"thin\" and has said he should be very angry with George Martin for not making more of his sound. If anyone has earned the right to talk about guitar sounds, then Keith Richards has. I, alone, could write a book about just that, never mind anything else, because I've devoted more time to that than anything else in my life. John might have a definite idea of his part, sometimes George was fresh to the song, so could add better ideas. It was collective, because each was paid by contract and Laws of Copyright, to do just that, and no more. I just watched a documentary on Cream, with Ginger Baker, Jack Bruce, and Eric Clapton. Nothing got them so angry as who got paid for what. Jack Bruce and a lyricist, Pete Brown, had the copyright. Now where does the bassist and lyric writer get the most money, and Clapton and Ginger Baker get just part performance, except in Cream? However, they got paid for what they did, and that was made clear to them at the time. Do not think they didn't know or understand. No matter how they complain, every musician knows this. When the Beatles broke up, George was twenty-seven, still very young. Even so, he had a wealth of songs \"in the can\". Lennon and McCartney cannot be Session Guitarists, because they didn't know enough to do that, George and Ringo could sit in with most Bands, and do their job. So many fans and a few stupid musicians, still cannot understand, how two of the best Song Writers of ALL TIME, could not do what George and Ringo did. Well can you read a book? YES, but can you write a book? EEERRRRR, NO! They are entirely different skill sets. Writing New Music, stuff no one has ever done, is as rare as Rocking Horse SHIT. Copying, or doing in the style of\u2026, is piss easy, anyone can if they can coordinate, as musicians must. Most of the answers on here about the Beatles, are by people who could no more write an original song, as flap their arms and fly. I have, can, and do. To put your head in that group of people, is very rare, few can. If you love the Beatles, and want to appreciate them on an intellectual level, then for lyrics, study Carl Gustave Jung on Archetypes, as Lady Madonna, Paperback writer, Eleanor Rigby, even Sergeant Peppers, are all modern archetypes, (and loads more). Try making up one yourself, and your appreciation of Beatle lyrics will grow. If you want to appreciate Beatle Music, other than just enjoy listening to them, then get a guitar and slowly follow what they did. I'm not saying play their songs, just strum, and pick out the melody slowly, nothing I write, or anyone can write, will fill you with more AWE, than that. ",

            "answer_text": "George Harrison was a better guitarist. I'll go in depth why, but first let's give John Lennon an honorable mention. That \"something\" guitar riff in the beginning of I Want to Hold Your Hand is legendary and unforgettable. John Lennon uses a complex and unique playing style for his rhythm part in this song. Playing on a Rickenbacker 325c58, those chords gave the Rickenbacker a reputable name. I absolutely love the rhythm part for this song. It sounds so unique and just so cool.  Listening to just the rhythm part alone makes you realize that John Lennon was quite talented on the guitar. John's mother first taught John to play guitar using banjo chords. Which is understandable because the Beatles' song, All My Loving has banjo chords for both rhythm and lead. Such a beautiful song. Again, John plays his first Rickenbacker but the style of his playing is different. John uses a technique called Triplet Strumming. A very hard technique to learn in my opinion. John rapidly strums his guitar up and down repeatedly throughout most of the song. I've been playing guitar for 12 years and still can't really do that\u2026 Back on board, John was taught some chords from his mother. It was Paul and George that taught John the rest of the guitar, and he went on to learn from there. John was very underrated when it came to the guitar. And he displayed his potential in many songs we love today. Now, without further-a-do\u2026 George Harrison.  Why do I think he was the best guitarist in the Beatles? Well, his music explains it alone. Till There Was You was the first Beatles song to include a classical nylon string guitar. Played by George Harrison. For this song, George played a 1950 Jos\u00e9 Ramirez De-Estudio Classical Guitar. Are you familiar with the solo in that song? George wrote it and it sounds so beautiful. Another great song is You're Gonna Lose That Girl. The solo in that song was played by George and it is so emotional. As he harmonizes \"You're Gonna Lose That Girl,\" his guitar solo cries just that. It sounds so fitting.  George not only knew how write a good guitar solo. He knew how to twist your emotions with the sound of any guitar he picked up. And that's what matters in a true guitarist. It's not about shredding, ya know? Rest In Peace, Mr. Lennon and Mr. Harrison. :(  ",
