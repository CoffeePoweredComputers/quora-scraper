Let\u2019s face it, Young is a great song writer and singer, but he ain\u2019t that great of a guitar player. But he does what any good person does. He knew that if he couldn\u2019t be a great player, he could have one of the coolest tones ever while writing some of the best songs ever written. That can make up for a lack of talent. That and having his own style, which I still think is more important these days then chops. So, is Neil Young a good guitar player, no. But that\u2019s also what makes him great. ",

In fact many are hooks for a tune. For a comparison of leads, check this link out, and wait for Neil\u2019s turn on guitar - I think he blows everyone away, including McGuinn, Clapton, et al. Neil\u2019s lead plays behind the video collage at the end.  ",

I like his solos on the whole, he does not try to be slick, and he uses natural valve distortion to very good effect, something like \u2018Cortez the Killer\u2019 is very melodic, whereas \u2018Down by the River\u2019 develops into a crazed energetic marathon. You can always tell it is a Neil Young solo, he has his own \u2018voice\u2019 with guitar, and that is a sign of a natural musician. I don\u2019t love all his solos, but then again, he probably says the same about mine :) ",

Learning the \u201czen of guitar playing\u201d requires you not to make every song a vehicle for endless riffing and mindless copies of other recorded guitar solos. Neil uses the guitar to speak to you depending on the song and what his subject is about, so on electric he exhibits anger, frustration and cynicism while on acoustic he exhibits beauty, nostalgia and the nature of love. To find all this in one player was both a gift and an inspiration to me while I was frustrating myself trying to sound like everyone else BUT myself. ",
