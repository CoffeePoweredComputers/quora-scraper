            "answer_text": "my dear, original music doesn't exist. since the time of the masters Leonen and Perotin (XII century) the music is all made of copying and modification of the existing, with imperceptible innovations that led us to Strawinsky, Stockhause, Berio, etc etc. To enter this glorious tour, my friend, the only way is to study composition and conducting in a Conservatory of Music for ten years. If you talk to me about pop music the road will be enormously easier but I can't advise you. ",

            "answer_text": "Personally I wouldn't worry about making original music other than it being your own work. Everyone gets influenced by everyone so it is extremely difficult to come up with something new if that's what you are trying to accomplish. Again I wouldn't worry about it. Just make whatever comes from your heart and people will like it ",
