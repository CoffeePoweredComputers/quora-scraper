            "answer_text": "Dear Pieter,I started playing when I was 3-1/2 years old, and my mother decided that I was going to be a great concert pianist. If she had left me alone to follow my diverse interests (like building things, anthropology, archeology, race-car driving, gardening), and allowed the piano to be just ONE of my interests, there's a good chance that I would have gone on to be a professional pianist. (One of my interests at University was to be an accompanist like Gerald Moore; but that \"wasn't good enough\" for my fame-obsessed stage-mother.) I practiced six to eight hours a day from age twelve onward, (up from four-to-five earlier on), I was home-schooled because playing the piano that much really didn't leave time for anything else. (Fortunately, the University had classes for foreign students which covered topics like History and German, and my parents had an extensive library, so I still matured into a relatively well-educated person.) However, given the limitations of being a child, there were many, many pieces I wanted to play which I was neither physiologically nor psychologically mature enough to tackle. For instance, I had to fight my professor tooth and nail to get him to allow me to play the Sonata Opus 111 by Beethoven when I was 16; he said nobody should be playing a work like that until they were at least 30. Other composers (Liszt, Scriabin, and Brahms come to mind) were quite untouchable for a female of small stature. What I'm trying to say is, if you are truly interested in becoming an artist of any kind (whether it's a musician, an actor, a painter, a writer), it's o.k. to start in your teens, as long as you are passionate enough to devote a significant part of your day, every day, to practice. (Think of the thousands of hours put in by young tennis players, football or ice-hockey players, golfers, swimmers, ice-skaters -- you get the idea.) The advantage (for a pianist) of starting seriously in your teens is that your hands are (presumably) big enough to grasp large chords, your feet can touch the pedals without extensions, and your muscles are developed enough to endure hours on end of practice. You probably also have a better attention-spam and more focus than a child. (Keep in mind that I'm NOT referencing \"child-prodigies\" as any sort of comparison point.) Now, as to becoming a \"concert pianist.\" That is a very lofty goal, one not achieved by many. For every Horowitz, Serkin, Richter, Argerich, or Zimerman, there are thousands of would-be pianists who spend their adult lives teaching the piano, or accompanying choirs, or acting as studio musicians. It takes a lot of luck, training, and access to great teachers to become a professional concert pianist. All that being said, if you are passionate about this goal, I'd say \"go for it.\" Just be a bit more sensible than my mother allowed me to be, and study something \"useful\" along the way (like perhaps chemistry, or computer programming, or accounting, or math) so that you can make a comfortable living when you grow up, in case your dream-career doesn't work out. Good Luck! ",

            "answer_text": "There are probably a lot of factors that contribute to success as concert musician, one of which is being at the right place at the right time. There probably exists people who are playing the violin as well as Perlman does as we speak, and the world may never know their name. That being said, you certainly can still achieve the degree of skill possessed by a concert pianist. Let me give a personal anecdote! 9 months ago, at the age of 14 1/2, I started taking violin lessons. Even before then, I knew that I wanted to make a living as a musician. I had been introduced to the violin at the agency of 9 through my district's music program, and had been playing absolutely no formal training for 5 years. Did this give me an edge? Maybe. I can't really say\u2026 but all I know is that my first teacher called me a beginner when I first walked into her studio. Even though I was playing as a first violinist in my school's orchestra, I still had to work from the ground up. As someone who had gained a passionate love for classical music early on, I tried and tried to play my favorite (difficult) violin concertos\u2026 but to no avail. I was desperate for a musical outlet, but without proper technique, I was just a caged bird. 9 months ago, I could not: -Hold my violin and bow properly -Control my bow or perform any bow strokes -Control my vibrato -Play a 2-octave major scale -Practice correctly -Read music I was lucky enough to find an excellent violin teacher who had experience with students like me! She was able to fix all of those issues, teaching me the foundations of the violin. Once I knew how to, I got serious about practicing. It was ugly at first\u2026 I had to practice bowing on open strings just so that I could gain fundamental bow control. Even though I have perfect pitch, my scales were so grossly out of tune because I lacked muscle memory of finger patterns. But, as I did that every day, I became more comfortable playing, and began to branch out to more advanced techniques. Now, I am able to play 3-octave scales fluently, perform various bow strokes, and best of all, express my musical ideas with a decent tone. You can do it! It doesn't matter how musically talented you think you are. The only talent you need is persistence. Nothing will ever come immediately, but if you do it consistently, constantly paying attention to what you can imrpove, it will come! On a side note, I'd like to debunk the idea that you need to be at a certain level at a certain time. You have your entire life to become the pianist you want to be! No one is a consummate musician straight out of music college. My violin teacher's husband, also a violin teacher, doesn't even hold a degree in violin performance. He had to gain his skills after college, but if he told me he had a degree from Julliard, I would have believed him. There are many roads that lead to the same destination; sometimes, you just have to take the scenic route. ",

            "answer_text": "Here is one definition of \u201cconcert pianist\u201d: A pianist who tours the world playing concerti with orchestras and giving piano recitals, all alone, in recital halls, drawing a decent audience. This would be the top level of \u201cconcert pianist\u201d but I don\u2019t know another definition of it. I personally have not heard of a concert pianist who began playing piano at the age of 15 or more. That doesn\u2019t mean one does not exist. One of the characteristics you might notice about very talented musicians is that they get really good when they are really young. You can read biographies/resumes of some of the young excellent pianists who are currently doing the concert tour, and I think you will find that they made their \u201cconcert\u201d debut when they were very young - 6 to 12 years of age, in many cases. This means that they had a decent size repertoire and the chops to play some of the most difficult pieces in the piano concerto reperoire well under the age of 25. Most started seriously studying the piano at age 6 or younger. It cannot be said what YOU, yourself, can do starting at age 15. It can only be said what age other famous pianists have begun studying.

            "answer_text": "There are many factors that come into play regarding starting the piano later in life. When you ask if you can become a concert pianist, it\u2019s important to identify exactly what you mean by that. Only a tiny number of concert level pianists in the world ever carve out a career playing classical concerts as soloists in recitals and with orchestras. Most end up teaching and doing other types of work in order to make a living if they monetize their piano skills at all. However, if your primary concern is becoming a high level player of classical repertoire on the piano, there are instances where people who start late in life achieve a high degree of proficiency at the instrument. A great deal depends upon the exposure you have had to music in your life. If you have played another instrument or have sung a great deal, this will certainly help enormously in developing your affinity for the musical language as well as a degree of dexterity depending upon the instrument you have experience with. Even just listening to music a great deal over many years offers tremendous advantage over someone coming into studying the piano with no previous exposure to classical music whatsoever. Here is an article and video which covers this subject in more depth for you: Can you Be Too Old to Start Music Lessons?  ",

            "answer_text": "Becoming a concert pianist, as in forging a full-time concert career? It depends, really. To achieve such a goal, you need daily practice, up to 5 hours a day minimum. In addition, you need a good teacher. Not just any teacher, but a professor at a music conservatory or a university. Or a reputable private teacher whose students win prestigious competitions and get admitted into famous schools. You need to build an excellent technique and a large repertoire, both of which take a long time. But honestly, making a full-time performance career is rather difficult, and most conservatory grads do not succeed in such a goal. Some teach and accompany, but many also leave music and go into other fields, such as law, science, and medicine. ",

The answer is simple: add up the hours. Do you have the time? You don\u2019t indicate why you want to become a concert pianist: fame? Glory? Global adoration? If what draws you to the piano is any of these reasons, stop right there. You might be better off getting a piano and some lessons and simply learn to love music. You might even end up liking the piano. ",
