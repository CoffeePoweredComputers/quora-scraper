            "answer_text": "Tough call to make. Depending on how you look at it. Here's 3 best forms for creating money: 1. If you look at what type of communication generates the most revenue worldwide, then the best form of communication is generic marketing brainwashing that stalks you everywhere you click and tries to create a wanting for things you don't need. Billions of dollars of online ad revenue, TV and print adds. 2. A similarity successful form of communication is writing about what people desire in a way that makes them hope and believe that it could come true, even though they know it's probably (99.9%) not going to happen. Thinks like an article on how you can generate 20x you income using just these simple funnel building steps or things of that nature. 3. Another success is making poignant problem statements that resonate in real life timescales. Things people instantly feel to be a true depictions of problems they already have observed or felt themselves. Donald Trump is really great at this. There's a show on Netflix showing an interview with him concerning his divorce from his first wife. He says something to the extent that if a wife is constantly on a husbands back about not being around and working hard and providing for the family and building a business, that husband will have a much harder time accomplishing those goals. Now who wouldn't agree with that. Enter the second piece of this formula - add and outrageous statement as a solution. So where most people would answer with 'we should do therapy or take a vacation together', he says dump the wife as fast as you can. Where most politicians who also recognize immigration as a border problem would say 'we need to find a political solution', he says build a wall. 4. A very effective way of talking to people is doing it military style - the Bottom Line Up Front or BLUF method. You've seen this in movies. A four star general is briefing the president and his entourage. He sums up what happened and provides options in less than 90 seconds. 5. If you're not selling soda, cars, smartphones or other consumer goods and not running for president or planning combat operations, the best form of communication is story. A narrative. A conflict between a hero and a villain battling it out with uncertain outcomes. Now a story needs to fit the format. This is hard to do. But important. For instance a book and a screenplay will have the same story but told in different length and with different tools available in the print and film worlds. So do your best to understand the format and adapt your story to its universe. \u2014 Regardless if you brainwash people to buy something or tell them a story. Remember that old wisdom - people don't remember what you said but how you said it. ",

            "answer_text": "If by communication you mean verbal communication, I am comfortable both with talking and writing. But I prefer talking. For some reason, I tend to impress people and engage their attention far more when I talk my ideas and opinions, rather than say, typing an application, affidavit, blog post or an email - even when I try to say the same thing in both mediums.  Even since I got into law, I found the writing forms a bulk of the communication in bureaucracies AND most of your 'practice' as a junior lawyer - hence I realised I'd have to develop my writing skills or perish. However, despite my fairly good typing skills - writing out things feels dry, contrite and impersonal - I don't get the 'feel' of communicating something when I can't see or hear the other person AND hence, don't get the 'drive' to be as alive, as witty and passionate when I 'talk' using typed/written words.  I can't represent things by gestures, facial expressions and tones when typing. I can't do dramatic pauses or alter the flow of speech for 'effect'. When I try to pull a sarcastic undertone, it goes missed online. Typing emoticons to compensate feels really weird, even if I manage to find the 'correct' one to express how I feel when I say something. The slowness of typed communication as opposed to the fluidity of speech gets my thoughts all muddled and clunky. Hence, I'd devolve to very clinical, dry and logical drivel - the way I'd write an LLM exam paper. Hence, my foray into online discussion forums like Quora and my blog - I have to learn how to express myself better in written communication. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on the objective For structured arguments with factual citations on complex and sensitive issues, written word is my preference. When speaking about a topic, I\u2019m liable to go off on tangents, repeat myself, use excessive hyperbole to make a point when it\u2019s not necessary, phrase something incorrectly and sound like an asshole, stutter, repeat myself, and forget the specific references that I can use to back up my argument (\u201cI remember reading once somewhere that this is a thing because numbers that are there.\u201d) When writing, I can reread my statement multiple times before sending it out to ensure that it conveys exactly what I want it to, and I have the time to look up the exact numbers or the quote I\u2019m referencing, plus fact/context check the other person\u2019s argument. I can also employ eloquent literary techniques in the execution of my explanation for flashy effect that the spoken word prohibits the practice of without prior planning. For interpersonal and social communication, however, I prefer talking face to face. What I gain in structure and planning in the written word, I lose in intonation, emphasis, and over the top hand gesturing. As is well known in the internet community, sarcasm doesn\u2019t translate into text very well. I also find that stuttering, fumbling, and repetition, while detrimental to a measured debate and removed when writing, add something to social interactions when face to face. It\u2019s also far easier to have engaging conversations because the other party can interject, question, and react to what you say as it\u2019s happening. For example, if you\u2019re telling a story of questionable appropriateness for the audience and/or situation, you can cut it off when the other person seems uneasy, instead of just emailing them a raunchy essay. Plus, when communicating by text, the other party doesn\u2019t get to hear my charming voice. ",

            "answer_text": "My speech cannot match with my speed of thinking, which is also why I sometimes clutter while speaking, or speak too fast to catch up with the speed of my thoughts. Well, It's kind of under control right now, but still.And yes, direct interaction tires people out and I am able to convey my thoughts better by writing because it gives me the option to think a lot while 'saying' things, which I usually like to do. I usually contradict myself many a times while saying something. I would be saying something and some other part of my brain would be wondering if what I said is actually true. It's like...philosophizing every moment about everything I say, which is why I always prefer to write about what I have to say. Also because it provides a log, so you can read whatever the person said as many times as you wish to.And also, as Leonard Kim pointed out, nobody knows if you haven't showered the whole week or if you're in your boxers, so!

Other words - the wrong ones - leap into their places unbidden and unwelcome. They tumble out of my mouth because something has to come out; people are waiting. \u201cI will have that project completed by Thursday,\u201d I tell my boss. \u201cJust waiting to receive the\u2026the\u2026the\u2026masturbation results.\u201d Very weird look from boss. My career is over. I will go crawl into a desk drawer now. An hour later - Crap, I meant maturation results. Yeah, that was it. The phone is even worse than talking to someone in person. There are no facial expressions or body language to interpret, so it\u2019s like I\u2019m only getting a quarter of the communication that\u2019s going on. Torture. When I can write out my thoughts, I have time to chase down those elusive, tricksy little words until I triumphantly capture them and line them up neatly on the screen or page. No squirming, now. Stand up straight. Hey, you - get back here! Before hitting \u2018Send\u2019 I can reread, proofread, edit, rephrase, delete, expound, tweak, and obsess. And that\u2019s just for a casual email to a friend. Language is so nuanced, so complex - I don\u2019t understand how anyone can sort through the millions of words that bounce around, plucking exactly the right ones from the ether and stringing them together in coherent sentences at will. It\u2019s like a superpower. One I don\u2019t have. So I will keep poking away at my keyboard and scrawling with my cheap ink pens, because that is how the words and I find each other. ",

            "answer_text": "1. Travelling in public transport and roaming about alone trying to reach destinations has taught me that a SMILE can do more wonders than anything. When you need a favour from a stranger or ease out a tense situation like interviews, a smile always works. (Worked for me)Some will keep a straight face while some will return a curious, questioning look but that shouldn't discourage you from smiling. But make sure it isn't a plastic smile or a wide grin from ear-to-ear. Keep it genuine and simple. Even when somebody is disagreeing with you, smiling at them makes them more obliged to listen to you. 2. Whenever you are asked a question in an interview or presentation, don't answer immediately just to look like you know everything. You may end up fumbling and stuttering. Take a pause, nod and buy yourself that time to process your thoughts to present it in a more coherent manner.Anyway because you're nervous, you assume the silence to be longer than it really is. 3. Never fold your arms when you are listening or speaking to an authority, a superior or are in formal situations. It is a sign of blocking behaviour and you may come across as under-confident, nervous or defensive. 4. While interacting with your friends and informal acquaintances, addressing them with their name and a light touch on their arm will make you more likeable to them. But know when to do it so as to not come across as a creep :D 5. (And my favourite) A lot of people can't differentiate between knowledge or brilliance and confidence. So, if you act like you know what you're doing, others will tend to believe that too and rally around. ",

            "answer_text": "I prefer written, because it gives me time to formulate my thoughts. I can go back and re-read both what I wrote and the response(s). It minimizes (though it doesn't eliminate) my obsessing over every nuance. I spend less time wondering if I'm mis-remembering the look on her face or the hesitation just before he answered. I can read precisely what was written and be content. The main exception to this is my inner circle, which I prefer to spend time with in-person, though this becomes a catch-22. I'm more comfortable with written communication because it gives me time to process whatever I want to say. My words can come out as I intend, rather than pouring out of me in an incomprehensible mess. In-person doesn't generally allow such pauses in response time, though my inner circle has learned not to be offended by my silence. I feel pressured to respond before I'm comfortable and often fear that I've said the wrong thing or miscommunicated something important. ... but with my inner circle, even though I fear being misunderstood (or, worse, feeling inarticulate), I prefer in-person because it gives me an opportunity to communicate what words cannot. With them (and no one else), I prefer hugs, an arm around their shoulder, or resting my head on their shoulder. I don't need words, I need physical presence of someone who cares. That matters (to me) a whole lot more than words generally do. ",

SEND CLEAR AND CONSISTENT MESSAGES Both Sender and Receivers send Messages \u2013 the Sender as the initiator, the Receiver in the feedback loop. Both need to send Messages that are clear and consistent. The way the Message is developed and presented is extremely important in creating effective communication. Anyone who sends a Message should: Tip #4: Select the appropriate words. Tip #5: Use supportive nonverbal cues. Tip #6: Choose the right method. Tip #7: Consider diversity factors. Each of these tips will help you send clear, consistent Messages. ACTIVELY SEEK TO UNDERSTAND Typically, the burden for effective communication has been placed on the Sender. The person accepts the responsibility and assumes that the Receiver, if intelligent enough, will understand the Message, and if not, will just need to be told again and again until he or she catches on. Effective communication relies on the active participation of the Receiver. The Receiver must have self-awareness and involvement in order to participate fully in the communication process. The Receiver should actively seek to understand the Sender\u2019s message. To do this, the Receiver must: Tip #8: Recognize perceptual influences. Tip #9: Use effective listening skills. Tip#10: Prevent Misunderstanding. Clearly, this is not a passive role.

            "answer_text": "The best method of communication involves: Face to face communication. It\u2019s much easier to express the meaning behind the communication when people can be in each other\u2019s presence and interact.Reciprocal. Communication is an exchange of information. It is best when it is two way and both sender and receiver have the opportunity to clarify what has been said until there is mutual understanding.Kind. Kindness is a way of showing respect. It is assuming the best in others and treating them that way.Honest. When you tell the truth, a person is in a better position to respond fully. Withholding information and/or not being truthful will cause a person to respond to the wrong communication.Straightforward. When you are indirect, people have to guess at what you really mean and some people are bad at guessing. They may either miss what you are \u201chinting\u201d at or guess wrong.Communication is a bit of a miracle when you think about it. One person must get an idea that\u2019s in his/her head into the head of the other person without any misinterpretation. We can use the 5 senses to accomplish this, part of which is our use of words and the way they are communicated. There are so many possibilities for miscommunication. Yet everyday, we are more likely to be successful than unsuccessful, especially when we use the 5 tips I outlines above. ",

But then there is the method of communication I LOVE irrespective of people. I love to write letters, post picture postcards, feel excited to see envelopes in my mailbox.  Wherever I visit, I make a point to buy picture postcards and write letters. To parents, sister, cousins, friends. As a child, I used to have 'pen-friends' and they were strictly letters. No emails or phones.  Some recent envelopes:  Nothing beats a 'good-luck' message than the one designed by a close friend! You can keep it with you and remind yourself of the good luck of having them.   On my birthday, I got a booklet of wishes! Believe me that was one hell of a gesture!  I get Rakhis, through mail.  And one of my most prized possessions, a friend painted a Pattachitra and sent me!  Dhannyawaad! :) ",

You can tell so much about person just by their eye contact, facial expressions and involuntary giveaways (such as blinking when lying, scratching the chin in disbelief or an averted gaze).I work in an open kitchen so I get to study Human behavior all day long. You know when a girls really into a guy when she sits forward, plays with her hair and gazes longingly into his eyes. Time and time again I see the guy ignore the signs and get out his phone. I feed off these behavioral clues, rarely have I come across someone I can't read. But. Actual communication with words? I'm rubbish at that. Can't do it. One of my worst nightmares is being stuck in a room with someone I don't know. I go quiet, I stare at the wall. My heartbeat quickens. Panic sets in. Ugh. I am much better at communicating through text. I have spent fifteen years honing my skills at chatting to people in text based environments. I'm pretty good at inflection through emoticons. There's no need for an immediate response (even if it's just a few seconds to reply). I can use elaborate expressions to imply intellect :) Overall, think of me as the strong silent type. ",

I call and text my wife while at work since she both like touching in regularly with each other. I also like the ease of use of email, Instant Messaging, and writing here on Quora. It helps to easily communicate one's ideas or at work to work on deliverables. However the phone is a great help at work especially when working with someone in a different office to be clear on important items I like to think of face to face, phone,   Text, Instant Messaging, email, and Quora as all tools in a toolbox where I am comfortable using each one, it just depends on the situation.

            "answer_text": "Action. They say actions speak louder than words, and it's one of the most accurate clich\u00e9s. A kind word can make someone's day, a kind action can make someone's week. They say three little words are meaningful, but cooking someone's favourite meal, or giving them a hug on a bad day, or even just the way you look at them will say \u2018I love you\u2019 more clearly, more beautifully, and more honestly than any words ever could. If a picture is worth a thousand, then an action is worth a million. Words may echo but actions reverberate through years and lifetimes. History is built upon the actions of people, and words without actions have proven futile. Words may define a nation but actions will create it. Think upon the most powerful things people have ever told you, and the most powerful things people have ever done for you, or to you. Words have limits, they can be confused, mispoken, misinterpreted. They elude many, and can be hard to remember. They're fickle, and don't stick. They can be twisted, or used to lie. The most important things can always be said without them, so they serve a logistical purpose at most. Actions are honest, straightforward, and pure. ",

But as far as what I prefer, as a 20-something year old that doesn\u2019t have her nose in her phone all day, these are my preferred methods and why: Email: Truly the modern day letter. It can be professional or casual, and nowadays you can get notifications for them so they are read and answered speedily. Texting: Only for short communication like, \u201cI\u2019m here\u201d or \u201cwhen do you want to get together?\u201d Longer conversations can easily get misconstrued through text, as sarcasm and teasing can often be misinterpreted. Meeting in person: Definitely my favorite. Gesture, personality, and facial expressions make a big difference in a relationship with a person. Snapchat: I do love Snapchat for speaking with long distance loved ones. Much like a text, but we can see each others faces and hear our voices. And they aren\u2019t saved to your phone so only you and the other person knows what was sent between each other. Instagram: Kind of ideal for those friends you never see but you like to keep tabs on each other. Of course it\u2019s useful for other things, but as far as interpersonal communication goes, it\u2019s the least representative of each other\u2019s emotions and well-being. ",

Also, for some reason I have trouble controlling the volume and tone of my voice, so that gets awkward. Digital communication also opens up the opportunity to use shorthand and slang that doesn't work in real life. Something exciting happened? ASJFJKHDKFKDJUDIEBJDKDKFJ Something funny happened? Lolol! (It's so hard to laugh in a way that isn't embarrassing). Also, there's no chance of me being able to hear the person I\u2019m talking to because of a noisy environment, or because I zoned out, or because they tried to talk to me while I had headphones in. It's much easier to read and listen to music than it is to speak and listen to music. ",

You can use this pointers wherever you want. Be it while shopping at vegetables market or while buying a new car. I'm sure every point mentioned above will add bonus points to your communication. Let's see an example I observed while halted at signal while riding. I was on bike riding back to office and was halted at a signal. Two autorikshaws were adjacent to me were present. One to my right side and others to my left. We were at the signal for merely 30 seconds. Out of these 30 seconds the two rickshaw driver shared a lot of information between them without uttering a word. Let's see how. Once they stopped, first autorikshaw driver saw other autorikshaw beside his. Now to initiate the conversation first driver used proper communication channel as mentioned in first point I.e he honked two times that got other drivers attention including mine. USE OF PROPER COMMUNICATION CHANNEL. - DONENow, as we were on signal stop for few seconds both knows how much time they had to talk and share thoughts. It leads them to communicate in short i.e. first one raises his hands till forehead to mark a sign of first conversation intilisation in very short time. Second driver acknowledged the conversation by doing the same thing , i.e. raising his hands till forehead. Now the real communication begins First driver indicates to other a left sided pointed hand gesture i.e. to tell him that his going to ride left side area from the next circle. Other driver acknowledged and point hands to straight direction which was acknowledged as going to straight forward area from the next circle. First driver then pointed his hands to the mobile device held on the panel of his autorikshaw handle. Which was acknowledged as a sign that he is having a hailing ride from a taxi app. Other driver acknowledged it with pointing his hands to his mobile device held on the panel of his autorikshaw handle. Which means he is also having a ride from taxi app. Then again second driver pointed his fingers to him to show an \u2018O\u2019 as to indicate Ola taxi service app he is using now. Upon receiving O indication from second driver the first driver acknowledged and showed him V gesture mark with his hands. I.e. to indicate that he is using uber riding taxi app. So both driver acknowledged each other's actions acknowledged them and also responded. Thus communication happened in a clear, short and complete manner . I hope you got my points. ",

Looking back now, he was not mean, not a bully, just regularly annoying 9 years old jokester. He was petty, he loved making fun of his friends especially the girls. These little girls did not want to confront my little brother or talk to him, so they talked to the meek older sister. The sister was so annoyed by the whole thing and just could not figure out how best to tell the story. At the time, I knew I will never say it out loud to my mother, so I decided to write down a note about my little brother. I wrote how he was at school, what these girls said to me about him. I don\u2019t even remember my mother\u2019s reaction. Until now, whenever I\u2019m angry I often lose words if I try to talk it out loud. If I try to tell someone my concern, the story did not go from A-Z but usually took a turn and go round and round. So I wrote it down, not unlike a diary, but I also not discipline about it. As I\u2019m writing this, I realized I prefer writing when I\u2019m angry. ",

Some things are better discussed face-to-face, and I'll certainly prefer that mode of communication. If your audience is vast and heterogeneous, and you must communicate to such vast people simultaneously,t the face-to-face mode wouldn't work. Then you consider the radio,tv, social media bla bla bla etc.So I think the question needs more classification on the nature of communication you intend to; for a precise answer. Note that there is no communication without response. When you have access to talk to people, and they can't do same to you, you only passed information. For communication to be complete, they're must be a response. ",

Western Union was great until everyone stopped sending telegrams and even I was born after the pony express.

This maybe the reason you end of liking music of different cultures and era . In music your lingual barrier ceases to exist unlike writing and speaking.You can listen music from different timelines and roughly judge ,what the people of that period were going through. Music can cater to your emotional needs as well.Lets say you are feeling extremely low,you can listen to some \"blues\" or if you feeling a big groovy then listen to some 80's rock band.Music is a language embedded in your soul.

I\u2019m good at squiggles, I guess. So I have two favourite ways of communicating: a) I like having a captive audience (like in an auditorium-type situation), and I have the stage. I freaking love that. I love the feeling of captivating an audience and taking them with me on a conceptual journey. This is the primary reason I love teaching adults, which is what I do for a living about half of my time. I love painting pictures with words, using weird analogies and humour. I love the vibe of a captivated audience. b) It\u2019s kind of linked to the above: I also love communicating by written word. So anything ranging from e-Mails explaining something complex, to handbooks, to writing novels. In spite of my inability to draw, I am a very visual person (used to work as a photographer). So my texts, both written and spoken, tend to be visual, and I like to paint pictures with words. ",

Body Language - It is the type of nonverbal communication, in which your physical behavior like your gesture, the way of talking, your facial expressions are expressing or conveying important information. Your body language will pass your message faster and better. Always use simple words in communication - Use simple words that can be easily understood. If the words are easy to understand then it is very easy to communicate otherwise it is very difficult to understand as well communicate. Simple language is very helpful in communication. ",

A face-to-face or telephone call followed up with an email/letter that covers discussed and agreed/disagreed areas is key in a business and issues management setting. A phone call to a friend going through a difficult time (a face-to-face visit is best) followed up with a personal note also works wonders. ",

Annoying answer, I know. I guess in our situation it would be better to discuss this through another medium, like having a telephone conversation, in which I could ask you for your specific goals for your communication, how you define \u201cbest\u201d, or simply to give me some examples for different situations we could discuss. I don't know if this would be the best method, but definitely a better method. A very different example is the communication needs I have right now selling an old refrigerator. I want to communicate with as many people as possible who live no further than 100 km away who are interested to give me money for it and then pick it up. The best method to reach and communicate with this audience is eBay. That's why you can find the fridge there. I'm also answering questions people have. It's very efficient and easy, which serves or purpose. I'm also organising a workshop for 20 people this week. To communicate with the participants and the client organising it, email is the best method to let them know the details, offer a channel to get in touch with me if they have questions and make sure everyone is in the loop. You get the idea, there is no best method, just different methods for different purposes. ",

Fix it. To fix it as efficiently as possible, do not repeat or rephrase. Instead, interrupt the flow of conversation with an apology. Share with them what you expected to see in the way of response. Let them know that it's fine that you didn't get that response. Let them know that however, because you did get a different response, that you want to make sure that you're not missing something. Then ask them to complete the picture for you by asking them, why did they respond that way? In most cases you will find that the words you were using meant something different.

But how do you know you have the receiving person with you and glued to your idea?

This is expressed well in culture. Tribal cultures where the spoken word is dominant, tend to have close social and personal relationships. It wasn\u2019t until the written word arose that science and formal education began \u2014 because research and factual information could be stored and could be extended based on previous learning. So\u2026 there is no \u201cbest\u201d form of communication. The answer depends on how you wish to interact. ",

Flicks of the eye, curls of the lips, even depths and lengths of breathing all tell you things about what characters think, feel, and are about to do, and they are all based on those of actual human beings. Every move we make, so long as it is not involuntary, gives us insight into what a person is thinking and feeling inside, and that can lead to not only understanding a person, but predicting their behavior. Perfect examples of this are the performances of actors that run contradictory to their own nature: Neither Jake Gyllenhall nor Heath Ledger were homosexual, however their performances in Brokeback Mountain were stellar and believable. Ian McKellen has both played a Nazi in Apt Pupil and a Holocaust survivor in X-Men. When you watch the way they move, talk, speak, and behave, you gain insight into their characters. Thus, everything that we do gives away information that is a form of communication to those wise enough to understand the language. ",
