            "answer_text": "Not all Producer's necessary use software at all as some are completely hands off while some are hands on. The primary role of a Producer is to supervise and direct the record making process of a song to its final mix stage. Sean Diddy Combs and Rick Rubin are hands off Record Producer's that oversees the recording process calling the shots as they aren't necessary the guy that program beats. They work along side a pro-tools engineer in the control that controls the recording sessions like most producer's in the recording industry. Some Recording Engineers and Mix Engineers are Record Producer's such as Jimmy Douglas, Chris Lord-Alge and Syvila Massy. They obviously use Pro-Tools and many times with a Hybrid Mixing setup with the use of analog outboard gear or an SSL or Neve console. Hands onProducer's that program beats and arranges the music can use just about any DAW or keyboard they can find of their choice. I'm a hands on Producer since I rely on myself to arrange the music and do all the programming as I use Presonus Studio One for that as well as recording vocals. How ever when I go to another studio other than my own, I act as just Producer overseeing the recording process working along side a pro-tools engineer directing behind the mixing console. ",

            "answer_text": "Music is created with instruments and modern music production softwares can act as those instruments, if real instruments aren\u2019t available. However, they are merely tools for the producers that are working with them. There are many softwares in the market that are widely used and the choice is usually based on what the user/producer is most comfortable with. Softwares that are used to \u2018create\u2019 music are generally called DAWs, an acronym for Digital Audio Workstations. They are mere tools that help the producer produce his work and not the be-all and end-all of the process of music production. Some of the most popular DAWs are (in no particular order) Logic Pro by Apple, Pro Tools by Avid, Reason by Propellerhead, Live by Ableton, Cubase by Steinberg, and the list goes on. Several new DAWs keep popping up often and several that aren\u2019t in this list are also popular. These DAWs have the capability of generating sounds, recording external sounds, mixing and even mastering. However, using them needs training, and expertise is gained with experience. ",
