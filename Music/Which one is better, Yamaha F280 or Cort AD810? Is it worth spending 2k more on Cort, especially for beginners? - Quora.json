            "answer_text": "The AD810 is far better than the F280. It has mahogany back and sides which is way better than the toonwood (Toona ciliata) back and sides used on the F280. The toonwood (Toona ciliata) used on F280 isn't even anywhere as good as the red meranti used on F310, forget about even comparing it to the mahogany used on AD810. The top on the Cort AD810 is made of spruce which has far better projection than the toonwood top on the F280. Due to these reasons the F280 sounds muddy and lifeless compared to the AD810. So, if you want a decent quality guitar made with decent quality body woods then get the AD810. If you just want a cheap guitar then go for the F280. ",
