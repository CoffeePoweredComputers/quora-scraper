            "answer_text": "Apples and Oranges, considering that Napoleon wasn\u2019t an admiral and Nelson wasn\u2019t a field marshall. Napoleon outlived his mojo and between 1810\u20131814 he gave away all he had gained, with some real stinker exercise of bad options. Nelson was at his prime before Napoleon came to the Imperial Throne and his greatest and last battle at Trafalgar cost him his life. Napoleon was a brilliant soldier, but he reached too far and brought ruin to his Empire. Nelson was a brilliant, aggressive field officer who depended on the solid craftsmanship of his Royal Navy to bludgeon his opponents with column attacks instead of line on line exchanges. His style worked and he rests in undisputed glory. ",
