            "answer_text": "I was a party/wedding DJ and a restaurant DJ.  You obviously play to your audience. For weddings I would ask the bride and groom for any special songs and then get a playlist ready for all ages. Class Reunions would be fun because I would bring music from those high school years. The restaurant let me play what I want but I was responsible for keeping people in the bar so you have to play what they like to hear. Wish I had Mp3\u2019s and computer when I was DJ\u2019ing! Would be so easy now! ",

I can\u2019t get into legal, other than to say depending on the nature of the gig, there may be performance licensing involved. As for the audience, you should keep in mind you\u2019re DJing as a service. You should be aware of the audience and their expectations. What can be played for a group of friends at a party or rave might not work at a local bar or nightclub. Your role as a DJ is to understand and meet those differences. ",
