            "answer_text": "Uhh\u2026 I\u2019m confused by this question. What do you mean sealed and unsealed albums? Do you mean will they send you albums that haven\u2019t been resold yet? Am I misunderstanding? Unless you\u2019re talking about reselling your own personal albums/ items, that you already bought then it\u2019s going to be very hard to get permission to sell sealed copies of albums. Companies and major retailers usually have contracts with suppliers and they get written permission to sell it on their platforms. Unless you ask the company and the suppliers that\u2019s making the albums, that you want to become a seller for sealed albums then you can\u2019t do that. If you\u2019re buying albums from the retailers and reselling them, then you can do that. But they won\u2019t send you sealed copies of albums to sell unless you have a written agreement with them. Please let me know, if I interrupted this right. ",
