            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A Why has KPOP become more westernized? I\u2019m honestly not the one to ask, but I can give my opinion. Look at the population of the USA (~325 Million people in 2017 (likely more if you were to consider \u2018undocumented immigrants\u2019 aka, illegals.) Look at the Population of South Korea (~51\u201352 Million in 2016) Now, obviously the USA isn\u2019t all of \u2018western culture\u2019, but needless to say it\u2019s a sizeable chunk of it. Add in other \u2018western\u2019 or English speaking nations, and that adds even more. Western culture, especially for music is something of a juggernaut in this respect. All countries artists have tours, many of those artists don\u2019t get out of their own countries, or perhaps off their land-masses/Continents. This is an important distinction, as Jpop, Kpop and Cpop artists have been known to work with each other, because of tight location. Thanks to the internet, people in various nations can now easily find music from those other nations easily. But the bulk of world-wide content (say like YouTube), tends to still be US-based, and hence the majority tends to also be US-content. Some would argue that \u2018if you can make it in the US music industry, you\u2019ve made it\u2019. If you take those views, then it would tend to point to trying to shift one\u2019s own music style to fit with the belief (erroneous or not) that music similar to that style, will do better than one\u2019s own style. (apologies if this seems to wander as to the point). ",
