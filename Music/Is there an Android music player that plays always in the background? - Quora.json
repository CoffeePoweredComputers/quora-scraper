            "answer_text": "Yes, there are lots of music player app which plays in the background but the one which I like the most is Audio Junction - Music Player . Its a material design music player and nice and clean UI and It has almost every feature which is required in best music player app. It also has sleep time in it , so you can pause the music after the certain period of time. It has so many color options , you can customize the music player according to your need . It also support Dolby Atmos, you will get the best sound output. and the best part it downlaods all the album arts or artists or songs if it doesnt have from Last.fm. So according to me Audio Junction is one of the best music player app of 2018. ",

            "answer_text": "With most free streaming music players you wouldn\u2019t be able to listen to music in the background because almost all of them are built on YouTube and on Android, Google doesn\u2019t allow that. However, there are some streaming music players that can do this. Check this player out: Rythme Unlimited Music Free: Songs in Background - Apps on Google Play. I recently found it and really like it. ",
