            "answer_text": "Yes, and no. Yes, because some of the songwriters who write songs for superstars are relatively unknown, and in some cases, these people are ghost writers - people who are hired by these artists and/or their producers to make music for them but are required to keep it a secret. No, because you have to be someone in the industry or community for anyone to pick up your work. Granted, you can be a nobody in the industry, a greenhorn songwriter for example, but you are a songwriter and it\u2019s your job, so you\u2019re still someone in the industry. By \u201cnobody,\u201d I mean something like an absolutely random fan or an aspiring songwriter who hasn\u2019t even published a single piece of work. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, absolutely. THE EASY PART - is getting material to an artist (or their manager, or a publisher, or a label etc). Every one those people is online usually with a website and a twitter. They aren\u2019t hiding. Establishing a relationship takes a little tact, but is not difficult. THE HARD PART - is writing a song that will impress them. ",

It\u2019s an extremely difficult path to find, but it can be found if you have the talent, persistence, and luck. If you\u2019re serious about pursuing it, make sure you learn the craft and the business. ",
