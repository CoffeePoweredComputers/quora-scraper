            "answer_text": "20th Century Noise Hard bop music is sometimes referred to as funky jazz. Back in the late 1950s, there was a movement away from austere sound of cool jazz. Musicians wanted to be more \u2022\u201cAfro-centric.\u201d This new style featured long stretches of melody over the same chord and used rock, soul, and R & B in its rhythm sections, \u00e0 la Ray Charles. One of the first tunes that appeared in this styles is \u201cMoanin\u2019\u201d by Art Blakey & the Jazz Messengers.  Another that really defines the style is \u201cThe Sidewinder\u201d by Lee Morgan.  While funky jazz, or hard bop, was a fresh take on jazz, it was and still is derided by many jazz purists. These tunes definitely predated James Brown. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm inclined to say Dave Bartholomew and Professor Longhair were the first composers to think along funk lines.  They were both pioneers in the New Orleans sound that really kick-started the funk movement with 1950s R&B.  Give a listen to two 1949 songs: \"Carnival Day (Bartholomew) and \"Mardi Gras In New Orleans\" (Longhair).  One of those two or both could be considered the first funk recordings. ",
