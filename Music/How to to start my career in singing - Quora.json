            "answer_text": "First thing is this: Think of it as a business. Do not think about anything else. Your talent, your skills, your dreams, your goals, your fans, admirers, fans, blah blah blah. All that stuff comes easy, pretty much on it\u2019s own, because that\u2019s the stuff everyone sees and, they wrongly believe that\u2019s all there is to it. Nope. Wrong. It\u2019s the surface. The thing that makes it happen, the \u201cguts\u201d that you don\u2019t see under the surface is the business. I\u2019m not talking about \u201cbusiness\u201d in terms of the gazillions of $. That\u2019s not the point. The point is if you don\u2019t have a grasp of how business works - ANY business - then you will taken for a ride. Would you get inside a stranger\u2019s car? Of course not. If you were \u201cdrunk\u201d with popularity, accolades and sweet talk and drinks and party, then you would be more easily saying yes to the car ride. It\u2019s the same with the \u201csuccess\u201d you make in your new vocalist career. Don\u2019t wait for the surface stuff to happen before you \u201cget serious\u201d about the business side of it. You don\u2019t want to get into that \u201cstranger\u2019s car\u201d of a career and think it\u2019s all safe just because you\u2019ve been assured by all the surface stuff. Here\u2019s some resources. I don\u2019t know about the actual product that Leah Harnett delivers but I\u2019ve been reading a lot of her offers by the emails I signed up to get and they all indicate she will deliver a very level-headed business side of things, including promo. The message is \u201cIt\u2019s like an investment. Money in money out and here\u2019s how to make it happen and monitor it.\u201d Here\u2019s the latest link I got: https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiMjQzMjY3NiIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNzYyODg3NDY3OCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZXZlbnRzLmdlbm5kaS5jb20vYXV0by1yZWdpc3Rlcj93ZWJpY29kZT0xZmJmZDk5ZDUzXHUwMDI2bWVtYmVyaWQ9MTY5MTA1MTM5MjM4NDQ5NjczXHUwMDI2Zmlyc3RuYW1lPVx1MDAyNmVtYWlsPTU1NjM0Mi50MkBnbWFpbC5jb21cdTAwMjZzY2hlZHVsZT0xXHUwMDI2X19zPWVmZWlvaGNjN2pjY3o2eXZicXN2In0 For vocal technique, I like Ken Tamplin. Great guy. Down to earth. Has the chops. Ken Tamplin Vocal Academy - Learn How To Sing Better Online Also, he made some business related errors of judgment and got jettisoned from the industry. If that didn\u2019t happen then he would have been in the same level as REO Speedwagon, Foreigner, Boston etc. If you look at his website you\u2019ll likely find a bit of the bio on that. Not gonna wish you luck because success ( \u201cluck, chance, fate\u201d ) only comes to those who are prepared. ",

            "answer_text": "Thats a tough one considering I don\u2019t know where you are starting. Lets assume you sing in the choir or karaoke or something. Beware if you are going on the recommendation of people at karaoke that you are really good. You had sure better be because the competition s fierce out there. Lets assume that you are really good. You are still in competition with college voice majors and drama majors. You can take a trip to Nashville and find people standing on the street corners singing their arses off. These statements are not made to discourage you but to let you know what you are going to encounter. You better have some thick skin when you are starting out and even after you score some gigs. Funny thing about the public. If you are performing for them they feel they have to right to walk right up and tell you why they don\u2019t like you. If you are a little heavy they think it is their god given right to point it out/ I have been performing for so long I don\u2019t pay attention to any of it which means I don\u2019t listen to the compliments either. That being said you need to make some demo tapes. Video and audio and some good head shots. It gonna cost some bucks but the better the quality the better the chance you will have of getting some gigs. Remember the old saying dress for the job you want to get. You need to have promo that says I am professional before you are professional. Be objective. Get some opinions of people other than your friends and relatives. After you get the promo up to speed take them around to some talent agents that handle voice overs or if you are shooting for live performances agents that handle that sort of gig. You must have an objective and apply your promo in the right places. There are also online booking agents ( Gigmasters and Gigsalad ) that will book you for a price. Everyone want to to specalize in something in order to market you. Wedding Singer, Jingle singer, impersonator singer, nightclub singer, gospel singer, country singer, pop singer, heavy metal singer. In order to compete you must narrow down your marketing options. If you are bitten by the performance bug there is nothing you can do but go with the flow. Get your promo together and start knocking on doors. ",

            "answer_text": "Singing is a very rich field that will shower anyone who wants to pursue it with a lot of opportunities. But, it is important that the starting phase of your career is something that you can put up on your portfolio. For this, you will need things like a great agent who can hook you up with clients that have a great name in the music industry. Not only this will cost a great amount of money but also with all the modernization and use of internet, music producers always look for talent on online listings. Thus, for someone who is already in an online listing will have a better chance of getting the job rather than someone who has just created a posting last day.  But, with their being so many platforms and portals for musicians these days, it has become hard as to choose the right one to look out for job. This is something where DOODEO comes in. It is one of the best market place for singers and musicians as the listings on their website are classified and also verified for proper clientele. Thus, for a client, this is nothing but the best place to look for new talent and so, being in the listings will improve your chances of having a job. Some of the things that you should remember in the starting phase of your career are: Being Up-to-date: Make sure that your profile is up to date. This will get you a better chance in a hiring as they will see that you are active and serious for your passionCheck regularly: It is important to check the listings regularly for jobsStart with low Pay scale: In you beginner days, do not head for fortune, start with taking jobs and focus on building your name in the industry.Thanks!

I am not talking about picking a few cords here and there. I mean play it so that people want more. Do people cry from emotion when you sing? Do people get up and dance even when there is no dance floor? When you sing, do people ask for requests? When you're done singing and playing or just singing are people waiting at the door to tell you how good you sing? Have you had some lessons? Are people climbing all over themselves to sing with you because you sound so good and they think if they sing with you they'll sound good too? Do you have one or two outfits that make you pop? Do you have a following? People who show up because you're going to sing there. Give me something to work with. What do you have to offer? ",

This can help you to improve more.  To start, you can join a group or create if you can. Start some small band performance. This will help you to gain confidence. When I started doing this, people came to know about me and i got offers to perform at different places.  All the best! ",
