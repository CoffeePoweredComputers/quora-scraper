            "answer_text": "At one time there were CD Recorders that were produced for consumer use. In order for certain of these to be used, they required \u201cAudio CD\u2019s\u201d. Because of the perceived loss of revenue from CD duplication, these recorders used the \u201cAudio CD\u201d which had a short encryption which allowed the CD to be recorded and these CD\u2019s had paid an amount of money to copyright management such as BMI and ASCAP to reimburse the losses. A regular recordable CD (CDR) would work in computers and Professional CD recorders such as the HHB or top line TASCAM models. They would not work in the Marantz or TEAC versions of those recorders. \u201cAudio\u201d CD\u2019s became a moot point with the general use of the computer CD burner which did not need the encryption band and would work with any CDR. There is no difference in the sound when played back either CD. ",
