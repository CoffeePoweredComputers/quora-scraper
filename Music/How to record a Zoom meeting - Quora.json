            "answer_text": "It depends on your position at the Zoom meeting. If you are the host starting the meeting from the Zoom app, then you can simply press the Record button. If you\u2019re an attendee, you need to get permission from the host after that you can record the meeting. However, even you have the right to record meetings there are still device limits. What worse is that many third-party recorders are unable to capture Zoom audio during recording extremely for Mac users, which is a headache for me. Fortunately, I\u2019ve solved this problem by using RecMaster which is really efficient and workable. Hope this answer helpful for you. ",
