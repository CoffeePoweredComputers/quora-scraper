            "answer_text": "Consider that KCon LA & NY have both gotten progressively larger each year since the first started in 2012 in LA, with attendance of 20,000. In 2018 94,000 people attended KCon LA and 50,000 came to KCon NY - I expect both records to be broken in 2019. BTS has become the biggest boy group in the world. That includes the US. They sold out their stadium tour here so quickly they added another date for each (the Rose Bowl, Soldier\u2019s Field, & the Metlife stadiums). They had the largest grossing tour this year - not KPop, just in GENERAL. The number of KPop groups coming over here to tour has just quadrupled - when I first started listening to KPop hardly anyone came and when they did it was to the West Coast. I remember SS501 going to Vegas and being startled. Now? I\u2019ve gone to 7 concerts on the East Coast (Atlanta has become a KPop destination - hallelujah!) this year, and could have gone to over twice that many. If I included the whole country, I\u2019d have been able to go to a KPop concert every 2 weeks without catching a duplicate. Possibly more. Next year? Bet it will be every week. KPop groups are showing up on TV shows (not just BTS - Monsta X, Black Pink, Red Velvet, & NCT all were guest stars on talk shows), are collaborating with American artists (back in the day, GDragon and Missie Elliot did a duet - nowadays all sorts of artists want a collab with BTS. Monsta X have collaborated with French Montana, Gallant & the Chainsmokers). SM (largest South Korean music/entertainment company) has just announced a \u2018super group\u2019 specifically created from their top male artists, at the request of Capitol Records - to tour in the US. When I say top, I mean SHINee & EXO - OMG. Taemin, Kai and Baekhyun! along with Taeyong, TEN, Mark & Lucas (all four in NTC). The DANCING will be outstanding! Good LORD! So yeah, a certain segment of the American populace (ie teenage girls) have found and embraced KPop in this country. Along with some of their mothers and grandmothers LOL There are fanboys too! ",
