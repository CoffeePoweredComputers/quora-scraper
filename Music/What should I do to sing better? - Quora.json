            "answer_text": "Very succinctly, \u201cgood singing technique\u201d is probably best defined as maximum vocal power and beauty with minimal effort. By \u201ceffort\u201d I\u2019m talking about pressure on the vocal cords. Producing good, strong vocal sound (power) is going to have to come from somewhere. Most people (wrongly) do this by straining the vocal cords. This is an option, to be sure, but not in any way can I recommend it as a good one, not when you have a a whole body full of muscles attached to your breathing apparatus that can supply that power. Once you\u2019ve properly engaged your body into producing the raw power, it really is just a matter of training your voice to manage how that power is directed. The analogy I like to use is that of a car: the voice is the transmission, not the engine. That\u2019s your diaphragm (abdominal muscles). Many people use their intercostal (rib) muscles in their singing, just as they do in their regular breathing and speaking (you know, those two vocal enterprises that really don\u2019t need any skill). But to really \u201cthrow\u201d the voice against the back of a large hall, you\u2019ve got to find a way to \u201cdrive\u201d the tone. This isn\u2019t done (healthfully) by straining the vocal cords; it\u2019s done by driving the breath from deep in the body. I promise you, if you do this right, it will make substantial and notable difference. Back to the car analogy: most people \u201cdrive\u201d their voices in first gear. By this I mean that they sing in one register, usually the chest register. When they get to high notes, they just push their voices harder. DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB. That is NOT how the voice was designed, and just like driving a car in first gear all the time, it will bring your singing career to an early and spectacular end. The muscles in the larynx (voice box; our \u201ctransmission\u201d) are designed to offer various \u201cmodes\u201d (think \u201cgears\u201d) of operation to create differentials in how the breath power is used. Smooth transition between these modes of operation is a learned skill: it\u2019s not easy, it usually takes a long time to master, but it will save your voice for the rest of your life. Once you know how to balance your voice (manage the \u201cgear changes\u201d) over the consistent breath (gradually press on the gas pedal), your technique will cause your voice to work much more efficiently, powerfully, and more easily managed\u2014so you can pay attention to making art instead of just sound.

            "answer_text": "A lot of people will suggest lessons, practice, exercises and blah blah. I\u2019ll go in the other direction. FIND A REASON TO SING. Too many singers think all they need is technique and they fail to cultivate heart and soul. I have heard many skilled and trained singers who bore me and all I hear is their technique. I\u2019ve also heard untrained singers with many vocal flaws who inspire me. Why? Because they have something to sing about. Janis Joplin is one. Although, alcohol and drugs helped give her her confidence. Where can you find something to sing about? Go feed the hungry, clothe the naked, heal the sick, comfort the dying, visit the imprisoned, march in a protest, have a baby, find something that makes you angry, sad, happy, hopeful, inspired . . . then sing about it. That alone is worth more than five years of lessons. Most of the world\u2019s greatest artists (not mere professionals) were people ostracized, lonely, abandoned, different, despised . . . they had something to sing about. It is often the least of us who become the best. When you have something to sing about, you can let your technique go and just communicate your deepest self. If you sing for fame and fortune, you most likely will never find it. But, know that it is in you and waiting to burst out. Chances are you have technique and lessons standing in your way, stifling your Kaddosh or mountain top experience. Kaddosh (From an article I wrote) So, the first part of the Canon is the Kaddosh. It is the opportunity for you to enter into the holy. The cleric says \"Lift up your hearts\" and our response is \"We lift them up unto the Lord.\" But do we? This little segment of prayer goes by very fast and there isn't much time to \"enter into the Holy.\" When you enter a baseball stadium there are a few thousand people there and it is noisy. You can probably feel the excitement and energy of the crowd around and within you almost immediately. Energy begets energy and soon you are unmitigated in your participation. You can easily let go and get caught up in the excitement. Just like when Isaiah entered into heaven in his dream, there were thousands of angels there singing. What is holy and sacred to you that gives you a special feeling or a high? Was it being present at the birth of your child? Scaling the summit of some great mountain and taking in the view? Could it be holding the hand of a loved one as they pass away? Is it like watching the sunset with someone you adore? Whatever it is, you need to know it and practice it so when your cleric invites you to lift your heart into a holy place, you can do it. To further augment this action of your mind, heart and soul, consider lifting your hands a little as you say \"We lift them up unto the Lord.\" ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with Bob Huber. Listening to many genres and singers gives you an idea of what you like. Also you learn how to sing by listening (and watching performances). And I personally think many of the today\u2019s singers (and some older ones) are more about the glitz, dances and dancing and the exciting music than about singing. If you can, get someone who can sing to listen to you and give you some tips. Proper singing classes is better but short of money and/or time may not allow this. Careful with this as not everyone has a good ear to hear your issues and many musicians (like I was when I was younger) are overly critical and may not give constructive criticism. Practice\u2026 practice\u2026 practice. But don\u2019t strain your voice. If you can\u2019t hit the note, don\u2019t try too hard. Ask a vocal trainer to help you with those. A strained voice can become a damaged voice if you are not careful. Practice the use of your \u201cstomach\u201d to breathe. Practice to ensure you don\u2019t exhaust your breathe before the end of the line (of music). Perform. First in front of your friends and people who have a ear for music. Ask for constructive criticism - and don\u2019t get angry with them. Even if you have no interest in performing, still let others comment on your singing technique. If you are, after this perform. Volunteer to perform in small events or karaoke nights. I have an issue with karaoke - most singers push up their reverb to the maximum, making their voice sound better than it is. If you want to learn how it sounds turn the reverb to a minimum so that you can hear how it really sounds. I think you should record yourself - but beware - you may not like how the recording sounds. I didn\u2019t. In fact, I hated how my voice sounded when it was played back to me. All the best in your journey on the way to learning the joys of singing! ",

            "answer_text": "Well this topic question is being changed but I will answer it for you. Comes near/dear to my heart. First realize that - that nervousness is something I LOVE! It shows vulnerability and man does it emote. Do not be so quick to get rid of it IMHO. Here\u2019s what you do\u2026 Find a place where no one else can hear you. (animals are a good sounding board by the way) Then find your MOST favorite song ever. Work on one part of the song that fits your voice the best. Try to listening to yourself by cupping you hands on your ears\u2026 ala the BeeGees. Find a place with hard surfaces/tiles so you can better hear the echo. spend time getting that one passage down having fun and experimenting with the inflections. Next try to sing it in your 3 voices. with a finger on your chest bone sing so only that bones is vibrating real good\u2026 then try to dial into the notes the best you can (this is the lower register - see if you like it) Next do the same with your throat - so that vibrates\u2026 (middle register) and finally your head/temple (high register). Learn about MASK singing (ala Diana Ross) squashing/flattening your mouth/lips pushing the air upwards towards your nose/nasal cavity. Next get a cheap mic like a $20 AKG 8000dm. (used is ok) and an interface like a used focusrite solo or behringer (about $50) - and download a free PC recording program - Audacity or a pro one like Reaper Cockos Native Reaper. Record your voice\u2026 and see where the notes you are singing\u2026 with all the different type voices\u2026 then use a graphic analyzer and zero in on what you like - try adding echo reverb or double-track-delay to hone in more. As you find a vocal sound that YOU like - start emulating that and keep practicing. Pursue getting a part of the song where you like it. Then start tweaking the arrangement to better FIT your voice. If there is no song that really fits you voice THEN write one! it is a fun journey anyone can sing\u2026 get comfortable so that you like what you do\u2026 you are inspired by what you are working on. If it still does not sound good enough for you try different genres (rap/jazz/talk singing/pop/rock/metal etc) - add some instruments to compliment you voice - try autotune - try other mics try karaoki - there are endless ways to reach your goal - I believe everybody can sing - just find your sweetspot / wheelhouse\u2026 and work with that. The destination is the journey soon you will have something you are proud of\u2026 go for it! tc ",

            "answer_text": "Keep in mind that not everyone has a naturally \u201cpretty\u201d singing voice. But, everyone can improve their singing (and their health) by remembering these things: \u2022 Breathe with your diaphragm. Your shoulders should not be moving when you inhale this way. Instead of your chest, your stomach should be moving up and down. Practice this for a few minutes and take long deep breaths. \u2022 Find out your vocal range and type. This will help you know what you are more comfortable with. For men: bass sings low, baritone sings middle, tenor sings high. For women and kids: alto sings low, mezzo sings middle, soprano sings high. \u2022 Sing more! Sing every single day so you get more practice. Make sure you warm up so you don't strain your voice. Sing scales, sing DEH songs, whatever floats your boat! \u2022 Don't try too hard or too much. Many people, usually females, love to sing high notes. In my school choir, all the girls are very competitive about how the sopranos are \u201cbetter\u201d than the mezzos or altos. This is a common misconception. Don't strain your voice trying to hit high notes. Try some low notes for a change. You may not be a woman, but remember: it takes a real woman to sing like a man! \u2022 Become active! Join your town\u2019s choir. Audition for a musical. Even karaoke night can be considered experience. I have been in 11 musicals. I participate in my college\u2019s drama club, choir and advanced ensemble. You won't get anywhere without taking the first step. \u2022 Last but not least, I want to talk about voice lessons. I'm no voice coach, but I can tell you right now, my voice lessons changed me for life. Music is so much more than it was to me before. I now have a larger range. I now know how to breathe correctly. There are so many precious things you can learn from voice lessons. Hopefully this was helpful! Never Stop Singing! (: ",

            "answer_text": "Hello, I\u2019ve been singing in bands for approximately 2 years but have also been singing for about 15 years. Vocal lessons are a good start to learn how to sing, and I would highly recommend them for you if you want to improve your voice. However, for the majority of my personal singing career, I have not had much vocal training. Despite my experience and the fact that singing is one of my deepest passions that doesn\u2019t mean nobody has ever said I personally sucked, I\u2019ve been told that I do indeed suck. When I first started out singing in a small class band many years ago. A woman told me I ruined one of her favourite songs ever, this was the only time someone has ever criticised my singing voice though. I still remember it but I don\u2019t take it as a negative, because people many years later have shown nothing but support for me. The woman that criticised me was just one girl who heard me singing from another room and has not seen me perform since. So it really doesn\u2019t matter to me now. The ultimate takeaway is that it doesn\u2019t matter how good you are people will always hate your voice especially if the song you sing is one of their own personal favourites. My best advice for you is to listen to songs that you like, and sing along with them. Listen to how the singer sings them and try your best to replicate what you here, this takes years of practice and there may be many new vocal techniques you learn along the way that might take some time to acquire but it\u2019s like learning any instrument. It just takes practice, as far as weather or not you are a bad singer, I would need to here what your voice sounds like in order to make a judgement. However, you do not have to be Freddie Mercury in order to be a good singer, James Hetfield and Dave Mustaine are two of the most successful vocalists in metal music but they do not have what one would consider amazing singing voices. As long as you can sing in time and stay on pitch you can be a successful vocalist. Another thing that will significantly improve peoples view of your singing is confidence, and stage presence even if you don\u2019t sing very well if you have confidence and move and perform in amazing ways, many people will not even comment on your vocal quality because they are so taken a back by your performing ability. This has been my personal experience anyway, I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Learn proper techniques and what not to do.  It is preferable to learn from a teacher who has trained ears and will listen to you and give you immediate feedback, to help you discern what you are doing that is good for your voice and ways you may be damaging your voice. Besides taking care of yourself (sleep well, eat right, get exercise so you are reasonably aerobically fit), there are specific things you can do to protect your voice.  Don't yell or scream.  Keep hydrated, don't wait until you're thirsty to drink; by that time you are already dehydrated.  Don't over-practice.  Rest when your voice needs it.  For a beginner, half an hour, even split in 15 minute sessions or less, up to a maximum of an hour and a half, is more than enough.  The goal is not to practice more, but to practice correctly.   Your voice is a musical instrument that uses lots of tiny and big muscles, many of which you are unaware of.  To sing well requires vocal coordinations of some tiny muscles around your vocal folds, moving the (pharyngeal) flap that you can't see that makes you sound nasal or not, lifting your soft palate to make room for airflow, and very good control over the breath.  For that, you need to relax and let the air in, and squeeze that air all out at an even pace even after you've expelled most of it.  To develop the muscle memory of doing it correctly, your body needs proper practice, repetition. I've written plenty of posts on singing tips - and there are others on Quora with experience with singing and know more than I do.  I would recommend that you read and check out the information available online, and find a really good teacher.  Learn the science behind the voice and the terminology.  Focus on hearing the difference in the voices of others - good vocal teachers should be excellent at producing the sounds for you so that you can discern the differences when they do it, and then they can give you exercises to trick your voice into also doing the right things.  With time, you can train your ears to also discern the difference.  As an example, I have always had a tendency toward a nasal voice.  You should easily hear the difference between pinching your nose and speaking, vs not pinching your nose, but there is also a way to maneuver the pharyngeal flap to lessen nasal sounding vowels, even though some consonants require some nasal sound.  I can now much more easily discern when I'm doing one and not the other, and I can move that flap at will now that I am 1. aware of it and 2. have practice controlling it.  Just as you can train other muscles of your body, you can train the muscles that alter your voice. Recognize that you have your own voice.  There is no need to mimic others' vocal instruments.  You will have a natural timbre, tone, and it's the best thing to learn to love your own voice, both in your head, and recorded (which may not sound like yourself at first, until you are used to it).  You may not be able to sing all kinds of music, be as loud as you'd like, or sing styles that don't suit your voice.  Sure, you can karaoke, transpose if you want, or just sing along anyway, and sometimes, that's okay. But, for regular singing and performing, don't sing things that are not intended for you.  I love to sing songs by male voices, but I'm a mezzo-soprano with a maximum possible range of D3-E6, and it's not all usable; that's only what I can trill. I can sing an F3/E3 but it's at the breathy end.  The D3 is a hit or miss even if I'm warmed up, it's not really usable.  I'm probably okay up to a B5.  C6, maybe D6, if I'm warmed up and having a good vocal day.  E6 needed for Phantom of the Opera? :( nope.  No way, never.  All this means that I can sing Phantom of the Opera but not that last note, and when I sing songs sung by kpop tenors, I am doomed to have to transpose for anything lower than an E3/D3, even on a good day.  I can, however, enjoy self-karaoke to most of the rest of such songs, and just blow air at those low notes. ;)  It gets too much into vocal fry, so my teacher has recommend I limit it.  Instead, I look for songs in a female range that I can practice with, and just don't sing the notes that aren't meant for me when I sing along with pop tenors. Don't worry about perfection.  Music is all about expression.  If you get your message across and feel it emanate from you, that's more important.  Things like pitch and rhythm are critical if you're performing, but it's okay to mess up when you're learning.  Don't take it too seriously, and don't screw around with your voice, either.  You'll honor yourself best by singing things that make you happy and that suit you. ",

            "answer_text": "I will talk practically first, then come at the question from a different angle. Practically first. If you feel that your voice could improve, then you need to do exercises to improve the voice. Everyone can make their singing voice better. What you need to develop is the support system around your voice. Singing comes from your core and the more control you have of that, the more control you have over your voice. This can then influence the texture, tone and power of your voice. Your singing will feel more enjoyable because you will be able to do more. Vocal exercises do not take long to do and if you look on google you will find some there. They key is consistency. The more you practice the exercises, the better your voice will be. Alan Watts the english philosopher says that the only reason that someone should do anything is because they enjoy doing it. Now wanting to improve is fine, but doing it on the back of a judgement about yourself \u2018I am bad, i must improve\u2019 is not the best place to come from. You should (and I hope you do) come from a place of enjoyment with your singing regardless of whether you believe your voice is good or bad. I went through a period of judging my voice all the time and it sucked all the joy out of singing for me. It became something to measure rather than something to do for the fun of it. If you are reading this thinking that you are not enjoying your singing, then that is where you need to get to first. Let go of all the judgements of how a singing voice should sound and just be yourself. That freedom alone will improve the quality of your singing as well. All the best singers that go down as the greats were unique. Some of them weren\u2019t technically the best, but they were expressing themselves so authentically, that people responded powerfully to it. Be yourself, enjoy the process, and find some vocal exercises to help improve your control range and power. Hope this helps ",

            "answer_text": "Singing is a learned skill and everyone can improve with the help of a well-trained instructor. You can learn to hear and then sing the right note, to sustain notes longer, to sing louder, to expand your range, to avoid hissing and other habits that annoy listeners. Singing is a physical skill like throwing a football, hitting a ping pong ball or dancing. Learning a physical skill takes practice, repetition and feedback from someone who already knows the skill\u2014you can\u2019t learn to sing just by reading a book. Like other physical skills, there are specific physical techniques needed to get the most from your voice. Have you ever seen someone throw a ball awkwardly, the ball flying off in an unpredictable direction without much force and then seen another person hurl a missile precisely targeted? The second person isn\u2019t necessarily stronger, but they do have every muscle in their body working in coordination. That second person wasn\u2019t born knowing how to throw precisely\u2014they learned a technique and practiced it until it was second nature. Singing is similar. The method for improvement is practice guided by an experienced voice teacher. An experienced teacher is important\u2014we could play ping pong for years and not improve much because we will not spontaneously adopt the techniques needed to hit with great force and spin. But add a skilled teacher and our ping pong can transform in only weeks. A skilled singing instructor can also help you make major improvements quickly. Currently your singing is a work in progress so while you practice you won\u2019t be perfect. To improve, you must practice even though you are imperfect and to do that, you must tolerate your imperfection. Improvement starts with not judging your skills. When judging (and finding yourself lacking), you get discouraged and afraid to try new things. My suggestions are: Accept you are a work in progress and that is OK.Find an experienced voice teacher and follow their instructions; do every exercise they suggest daily.Perform a 1-month experiment to see how much you can improve. Record yourself now, then after 1-month of lessons and diligent practice, record the same song. then take an objective look at how much your singing has changed.You are not anyone else, so what some other person can do doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is whether you are getting 20% of your best or 90%. Take some lessons, do some practice and maintain tunnel vision on improving your technique. You may be shocked how much better you become. Good luck and best wishes! ",

Now as you've chosen a good song this task will be damn easy. Now try singing it without the instrumental background. Singing along to the video will also help you. Listen to the original song a couple of times and try to sing exactly the same. Practice a lot and gather up some trustworthy audience who could give u good feedback. Record your voice. After weeks,you'll yourself notice the difference. Try it in karaoke mode and make variations. You can even record your voice like 1st time after a week after a month and such to track your progress Good luck ",

It's time we claim our bold and audacious selves.It's time to celebrate our fearlessness. As we do, we can begin to think of ourselves as bold people who are sometimes fearless instead of fear-filled people who try to be bold.Polyphonic singing\u200e (1 C, 13 P) i think you should try polyphonic or Vocal percussion\u200e .people want new things,something different from that of rihanna and Michael Jackson. don\u2019t ever underrate your angelic given spirit of singing ,to round it all i also think all styles or method are good but you just need to be courageous and more of a stylist.listen to that within you i believe you know what best for you.She\u2019s such a talented singer!\u201d they all say.\u201cI wish I could sing like that, but I can\u2019t carry a tune to save my life.singing is a skill-set, just like any other. And it CAN be learned.And while certain rare individuals might naturally sound amazing on their own\u2026 Finding Your Style The #1 reason mediocre singers staymediocre is\u2026They never really develop their own sense of identity and style.For example\u2026think of the contestants on singing shows like Mtn project fame or The Voice\u2026Towards the end of those competitions\u2026It\u2019s fair to say that all finalists meet the standard minimum qualifications of \u201cgood singers\u201d, right?And certain other rare individuals might always sound awful no matter what\u2026The vast majority of us will sing terribly when we first try\u2026but then get better by practising. At least, that\u2019s how it should work in theory.Develop a Bad-ass Attitude, Unlike drummers, bassists, and guitarists\u2026When you as a singer\u2026stand up on stage\u2026and open your mouth\u2026There\u2019s literally nothing for you to hide behind.The audience will know exactly who you are, and how you are feeling at any given moment\u2026Because they will see it in your eyes, on your face, and in your body language\u2026and most importantly, they will feel it in your voice.So if you don\u2019t honestly feel with 100% certainty (at least while you\u2019re on-stage) that you are the maddest motherfucker on the planet\u2026It won\u2019t matter how \u201ctechnically perfect\u201d your performance do you develop that confidence?Well, while there are many ways to trick yourself into being delusionally self-confident\u2026As we all know from the first few episodes of every mtn project fame\u2026delusional self-confidence is even worse than uncertainty.So the MUCH better option is to simply become objectively self-confident, by actually getting good at what you\u2019re doing.So for the remainder of this article, competence is what we will focus on.Just remember to keep in mind though, that without confidence as well, everything else is worthless.Got it? Up next\u2026ance has been up to that point, because all they will remember is the smell your fear and self-http://doubt.so encourage yourself you never can tell the extent of gifts you have in you.

            "answer_text": "There are several ways to train the voice.: Get a good voice coach. He/She will give you some exercises to be done every day.Sing in a choir with a good voice coach and practice at home with the same exercises. But note: This is good for the choir-sound, probably not  or a growing solo voice.For me as a professional it is possible to invent my one exercises on the base of experiences with my voice teachers.In my opinion it is necessary to separate warming up,  learning a new technique and studying a piece of music. Each of this subjects are essential. Here I can only give some hints, because the relation to a good and matching voice trainer is very important to succeed. Warming up  Do some exercises to combine your breathing-in  with the posture-muscles of your body. This will have the effect of a natural support. Activating the breathing -in-muscles is necessary. After every breath sing immediately a short phrase in a third or a fifth range. and keep going. To get an effect every exercise has to be repeated at least 3 times.Combine  forming the vowels first with breathing in + phrase then with breathing out +phrase.Use rounded vowels first (o,u). They support the resonance.High tones  need more open vowels than lower ones.Beginners have to start with  middle-high notes singing the scales downwards to prevent  pitch-regulation  with using air pressure. If you want to reach higher notes, you have to get softer and softer, because for the chords it is very similar to sing high notes and piano notes.Keep going! Don't control too much! Just do the exercise! Learning the technique is completely different: Guidance of a trainer is needed.The trainer is not only for giving orders to you but to guide your concentration and your attention to the important aspects. Be aware of what your body is actually doing. Hear what effect the exercise has on  your sound.Never start with complicated tasks. For example: Getting louder or softer is an intermediate skill. So it is with high and loud phrases with text.Awareness -> Hearing -> Controlling ->Awareness...Studying the music is completely different as well: Never mix up warm-up and studying the musicWhen you want to start with a piece warming up has to be done. Be certain about the style in which the music is written. Some styles need a special technique.Even most professional musicians need help learning the score with a r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur. Alert: If you had a good training, don't get confused with some of  his advices . Try to find out what he/she wants to achieve and  use the technique, you have learned.A  r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur is not a coach. He only can introduce you to the music score. Everything else is your business including reading your part.",

            "answer_text": "Practice is the key. I will share my experience. I love singing and you'll find me singing almost at all times. Initially, I used to sing songs only in a particular range, because I knew my voice didn't have the reach. However, over the years, I've started trying out songs beyond my reach and I've begun to feel more confident about that. So the point I'm trying to make is, you need to continue practicing and pushing your limits. Never restrict yourself. Over a period of time, you'll realise your voice opens up better than it used to, and you can figure out how to sing some songs in your own way. A few tips that can make your voice better and constant (without cracks) are : Sing in your original voice. I've tried many ways of singing, sometimes changing the voice is fine, but always sing in your original voiceI know this is said a lot, but no matter how many times one should say it, it's not enough. Avoid oily food. Strictly avoid. This includes any kind of deep fried food.Whenever you're about to sing or are singing, have some warm water. It prevents your voice from crackingDon't be nervous. In the beginning, it will be difficult. As time goes by, you'll realise very few people understand the tiny flaws you think you make. So break your own chains and sing freely, literally like no one's watching(listening)Always remember this, people will judge you too harshly. So go easy on yourself and how you find your voice and how far you've come, that is something for you to cherish. Enjoy singing! ",

            "answer_text": "Question asked: How can I have a more powerful singing voice? I assume it is not already as powerful as it can be. Of course there are some physiological fearures that benefit some people when it comes to voice (power). We have to have healthy lungs and well functioning mucous membranes. But the size of the lungs/vital capacity has little to say. We should have an erect posture and a good balance, our breathing should be full - including the whole torso - and make us wider at the waist. Take a breath of well being and contentment. This also opens up your resonance spaces of your throat (as well as lowers the larynx/voice box). It is paramount to keep the resonance spaces open - which begins with the full breath and is supported by larger muscles at waist level. Tune your vowels by adjusting your organs of articulation (tongue, jaw, lips etc.) for the optimal timbre - in accordance with the pitch. With training this tuning becomes automatically established at onset of the tone - thus being gentler on the vocal folds. No more compression should be produced than needed. Don't push, force or strain the voice in persuit of loud sound - we have to follow its nature as an acoustic wind instrument - and obey its resonances. We have to be familiar with the registers and how to negotiate them to achieve access to our entire range. All this technical training should be done with a well experienced singing teacher. Best of luck. ",

            "answer_text": "These are some that I use even though I am not in a band anymore I still want to keep my voice in good shape; 1. Tongue Twisters At first glance, practicing tongue twisters may not seem like an especially useful exercise, but they can help to improve enunciation of song lyrics. Practice the tongue twisters below until you get the hang of them: Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppersA peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper pickedIf Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppersWhere\u2019s the peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked? You know New York, you need New York, you know you need unique New York How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?He would chuck, he would, as much as he could, and chuck as much woodAs a woodchuck would if a woodchuck could chuck wood. Around the rugged rock the ragged rascal ran. 2. Laugh\u2014 From the Gut It\u2019s no joke; singing from the throat can damage your voice and produce a harsh or nasally sound. Instead, you should aim to sing from your diaphragm, or from your gut. Adopting this singing technique will also help you hit those tough high notes, increasing your vocal range. One great way to learn how to do this is by laughing (seriously!). Let out a series of Ha-Ha-Ha\u2019s, ensuring the sound comes from deep within your gut\u2014the louder the better! This will strengthen your abdominal muscles, improving your ability to sing with proper support. 3. Ear Training When you play a given chord on a guitar or piano that hasn\u2019t been tuned, the sound produced is like nails on a chalkboard. Listening to someone sing out of tune is similarly cringe worthy. Fortunately, ear training exercises can help us recognize when we\u2019re singing out of tune. All you need to begin ear training is some basic knowledge of musical scales. A scale is a sequence of notes that fall within the same pitch. For example, the C major scale is C\u2013D\u2013E\u2013F\u2013G\u2013A\u2013B\u2013[C] (with the second C in brackets to indicate that it is an octave higher than the first C). In the image below, the C major note (white key) on the far left is an octave lower than the C note in the middle. Start by playing a C-chord on guitar or piano in an octave within your vocal range (i.e. that you can easily hit without straining your voice), listening carefully. Now play the chord again, this time singing the note at the same time. If you\u2019re singing in tune, your voice and the instrumental chord will complement each other, meshing together to produce an appealing sound. Move on to the next chord in the scale, continuing until you\u2019re able to sing each of the notes in the correct pitch. Once you\u2019ve mastered that, try playing and singing the notes out of order. Work your way up to higher and lower octaves (e.g. to the outer ends of your piano keys or the frets of your guitar), challenging the limits of your vocal range. 4. Singing With Vibrato Vibrato is a technique that will leave you with a polished, professional sound; an extra \u201csomething\u201d that will leave an impression on your audience and show off your singing proficiency. Commonly used by winning contestants on shows like American Idol and The Voice, vibrato refers to rapid, repetitive changes in pitch (\u201coscillations\u201d) that make for a richer, warmer sounding voice. This technique allows singers to showcase the level of control and precision they have over their vocal chords and diaphragmatic breathing. Vibrato is usually used at the end of a sung phrase, subtly emphasizing the voice. Similar to guitar or drum solos, too much vibrato detracts from your performance, and can be tedious for your audience to sit through. Contrary to popular belief, it isn\u2019t something you add to your voice, but rather something that comes naturally with experienced singing as you strengthen and gain control over your muscles. It should never sound forced. The most important thing to remember when trying to develop vibrato is the mind-body connection. If you\u2019re employing the proper posture and breathing techniques described above, vibrato will come with practice. Hints and Tips: Keep your vocal cords hydrated\u2014be sure to drink lots of fluids throughout the day! Minimize tea, coffee, and alcohol consumption. Caffeine and alcohol dry out the vocal cords, and can make your voice sound raspy and coarse. Gradually work your way up to vocally demanding songs. While it may be tempting to start with Whitney Houston, pushing your limits without proper training will strain your vocal cords. You wouldn\u2019t take up weightlifting and try to bench press 250 lbs. on the first day, right? Singing is the same in that respect; patience is rewarded.

            "answer_text": "Singing is an talent that comes with a lot of training. Yes, some are naturally gifted with it. But, one needs to practice to sustain it or learn this special art. Some of the tips would be: First thing first. Singing is basically how we use our breath from the abdomen to move through the diaphragm and hit the vocal box in the throat which comes out as sound. Breathing is most important part here. So, learn some breathing exercises and do it regularly.2. Know your pitch. Any song comprises of multiple notes from low to high. Pitch is something the tone at which these notes are hit. It varies from person to person. So, take up a simple song and just hum it. By hummimg, your brain automatically finds the pitch of the song. If you are a beginner, do not attempt to choke your throat especially singing the high pitch notes. Initially chose songs that does not have much pitch variation. Once get the art of it, you can always increase your range of singing. 3. Singing can be done by combination of using your head voice, chest voice depending on what you sing. But focus that when you sing, you don't sound too nasal. I sometimes didn realise that in my singing, it was more of nasal sound. If you want to identify how much nasal you are singing, follow this small exercise. Keep your index finger near to your nose. Sing a song. While you sing, gently try to tap any one nasal opening not allowing your breath to come out from your nose. Continue to do the same as you sing. Now, if you were singing too nasal, you would sound a funny way. Else, if you are singing from abdomen, it will have no impact on your singing. 4. Similarly you can discuss more as singing is deep ocean you will continue to learn once you begin. But, I would like to highlight one last basic entity for singing. That\u2019s practice. Whether you are a beginner or a singer already, one needs to practice continously. Singing gives you a great amount of satisfaction and joy and boosts your confidence. So encourage you to give it a try and be passionate about it. You will enjoy.:) Hope this helps in some way. ",

            "answer_text": "AT THE A END OF THE ANSWER WE HAVE A AMAZING OFFER!!!! 1. The \u201cInstant Vocal Fix\u201d This is a quick trick that makes you sound better instantly. Say A-E-I-O-U (watch your jaw movement in the mirror). Did your jaw close on any of the vowels? Chances are your jaw closed on the E and the U \u2013 and most likely on others too, if not all of them. Take your first two fingers and pull your jaw down 2 inches (or even better \u2013 use a plastic bottle cap or a cork (wine) to prop your jaw open). And speak the vowels again. And repeat again (we\u2019re trying to re-program muscle memory \u2013 so the more the better). Now sing the vowels on one pitch. A-E-I-O-U. Your goal is to keep your jaw open (long not wide) without closing for all of your vowels. Repeat until you can do it. Now sing a phrase of one of your songs \u2013 and make sure your jaw opens to the same position on all of your vowels. You have to practice this a bunch before it becomes natural \u2013 but the more you do, the sooner this new movement is programmed into your muscle memory. And, you might be one of those lucky ones who notice the improvement in the sound right away (it will sound louder and more resonant with less vocal strain). If you don\u2019t \u2013 don\u2019t sweat it \u2013 you will. It just takes a little practice. (You might have some unwanted tension in your neck, jaw and throat muscles \u2013 try loosening them up and try it again.) The next time you perform open your jaw more on your vowels \u2014 it\u2019s a quick trick that makes you sound better instantly! 2. \u201cThink down\u201d for High Notes The next time you sing an ascending vocal scale or you sing a high note, try thinking of the way an elevator works. A heavy weight is attached to a pulley and as the weight pulls down, the elevator actually goes up to the higher floors. So, the highest floor is reached when the weight is the heaviest. Similarly, you should think down for your high notes or think of adding weight (resistance) to your highest notes. 3. More Power without Strain Who doesn\u2019t want more power without strain? This is a simple technique to apply and a bit easier than the one above. All you have to do is to keep your chin pointed slightly down and your pectorals slightly flexed (well sometimes it\u2019s a lot flexed) when you go for more power. Most singers reach forward or lift their chin up to sing with more power. While it may temporarily work, it causes vocal problems. Tipping your chin down not only works better and saves your voice \u2013 it actually SOUNDS better! Stand in front of the good \u2018ol mirror. Sing an Ah scale up and down in one phrase (1-2-3-4-3-2-1). Press your chin slightly in (point your chin towards the floor) \u2014 usually only 1\u201d or so. Don\u2019t let your head bob up as you raise the pitch. Keep it firmly in place. Go all the way up the scale of your voice keeping this position. Notice how your chin wants to move up as you raise your pitch. Keep it planted. This will give you more power and control and eliminate strain. Practice it until it becomes natural! 4. How to Get Natural Vibrato In Your Voice Here\u2019s a quick tip to get your vibrato working. Stand in front of a mirror; press on your chest with both hands, then, raise your chest higher than normal. Take a breath in and then exhale, but don\u2019t drop your chest. Sing one note and hold it as long as possible with your chest raised. Press on your chest halfway through the note (press kind of hard and raise your chest to meet the pressure). Relax the back of your neck and keep your jaw open as you\u2019re singing \u201cahhh.\u201d Imagine the air spinning around in your mouth while keeping your chin tucked down a bit and your chest raised. Keep in mind, overuse of vibrato is not a good thing in contemporary singing (pop, rock, and R&B). At the same time, no vibrato is also not a good thing. So, try ending phrases with straight tone, then into a little bit of vibrato. The bottom line is to do what\u2019s best for you. 5. HearFones\u00ae A good vocal tone is not established by singing loudly, it\u2019s established at medium volume. Good tone happens when vocal folds are strong enough to have a good closure but not touch. Releasing too much air creates a \u201cbreathy\u201d tone and releasing too little air creates a \u201cnasal\u201d tone. Unless you\u2019re really going for breathy or nasal as a stylistic choice, somewhere right in between the two is a perfect balance. HearFones\u00ae allow you to really hear yourself and work on your tone at medium volumes.

            "answer_text": "Best: study with a teacher with academic credentials. But if you cannot, see the introductory text below. ABCs of Singing There\u2019s an easy way to think about voice culture: the ABCs of Singing. The same things apply to the speaking voice. A is for Alignment. For singing, stand with feet a few cm. apart, NOT exactly parallel, with weight slightly forward on the balls of the feet. Feel a sense of energy in your feet and legs. Keep knees flexible, not tight. Raise your hands far, far above your head, and then allow them to descend and rest easily at your sides. Let your back be straight, even if you are seated for Indian music. Imagine there is a silver thread from the base of your spine out the top of your head that allows your body to float up, up, up. Allow the ribs to expand like an opening umbrella. It is never static or tight, but flexible and dynamic. As you practice, come back to these points, and refresh your alignment/posture. B is for Breathing. Exercise: \u201cBreathe through a straw,\u201d inhale through puckered lips. Immediately hiss out LOUDLY, with great energy from the middle of the body (abdominal area). Feel how this increases energy in the breath. Maintain alignment - don\u2019t allow the upper body to collapse as you exhale. Return to this exercise a few times as you practice. As you sing, breathe LOW in the body, and imagine you have a tire inner tube around your middle; fill it up and lean into it. Always think \u201cup.\u201d C is for Coordination. Importantly, as you go higher, let the voice get lighter and brighter - don\u2019t use a lot of pressure. But, allow the ribs to rise a little, and allow the energy from the middle of the body to increase a little. Don\u2019t yell or scream - instead, slightly increase breath energy and expand your posture to make the sound a little higher or louder. Exercise: easily repeat one note with a breath between then sustain and crescendo diminuendo - get louder and softer [ a, a, a, a\u2014\u2014\u2014- ] . Repeat the exercise on higher note, several times. This is a very basic start. To really improve your singing voice, get a teacher with academic credentials in voice teaching. ",

Perhaps you join in at your local on the karaoke, or just sing in the shower, theres something here for everyone. Why not pick up a few singing and performing tips from our free guides, or browse the above tabs to see our large range of backing tracks, sheet music, song books, equipment and accessories. Source: 5 Secrets To Make Your Voice Sound Better \u2013 Talz Mag \u2013 Medium The human voice is one of the most fragile instruments, and is incredibly difficult to master. If you want to learn how to sing well, its going to be a long battle, but here are some great singing tips to help you avoid some common pitfalls. Breath from the diaphragm. You really need to control the air that youre expelling when you sing, and breathing from the diaphragm gives you more control to do this. Breath in so that you feel your stomach moving gently outwards when you inhale.2. Practice your scales. Yes they can be boring, but they really will exercise your singing muscles and help strengthen your voice and extend your range. They will also help your sense of pitch.3. Dont strain your voice. Warm up before you start and dont try to sing too loud or too high as you might damage your vocal cords. Take it slow and steady and youll sing well in no time. Keep your practice time to an hour or so a day, then move up if you feel like it. If you ever feel like your voice is straining, or if you feel soreness or pain, stop right away.4. Seek out peoples opinion. Learning to sing well takes a long time, and during this time you may hear peoples comments about your voice. Use their comments constructively and if there is something you can improve on, try to work on the problem.5. Make recordings of yourself. This is the best way to hear your problems, because you can separate yourself from your voice and listen to what other people hear. You may not like the sound of your voice at first, but keep at it; youll improve vastly, and youll start to notice stuff you like about your voice and really expand on those things.6. Talk to established singers. Most of them will be happy to give you some tips and exercises that helped them out, and any time you need to ask for directions, the best idea is to ask the person thats already at your destination.7. Eat and drink well. Eat healthy and drink plenty of water. Dont do anything that will affect your voice and prevent you from singing well. Caffeine isnt particularly good for you, as is anything that causes mucous build-up like dairy products (drinking milk before singing is a particular bad choice). Dont smoke or drink too much alcohol as this can really affect your singing voice.8. Sing for the style. If youre singing country, listen to country singers. If youre singing rock, listen to rock singers, etc. Notice things that are the same in each style and emulate those. Be careful, however, to keep your voice unique, and not to simply copy another singers voice. Allow your personality and your voice to come out in your music.",

            "answer_text": "You asked for some singing tips, right! I\u2019m not quite a professional singer but i do sing , so i looked up some really helpful singing tips from a veteran vocal coach. I\u2019ve tried it myself and it really works. Cari\u2019s Top 5 Singing Tips 1. The \u201cinstant fix\u201dThis is a quick trick that makes you sound better instantly, so I call it the \u201cInstant Fix.\u201d Say A-E-I-O-U (watch your jaw movement in the mirror). Did your jaw close on any of the vowels? Chances are your jaw closed on the \u201cE\u201d and the \u201cU\u201d \u2013 and most likely on others too, if not all of them. Take your first two fingers and pull your jaw down two inches \u2013 or even better, use a plastic bottle cap or a wine cork to prop your jaw open. Now speak the vowels again. And repeat again (we\u2019re trying to re-program muscle memory \u2013 so the more the better). Now sing the vowels on one pitch. A-E-I-O-U. Your goal is to keep your jaw open (long not wide) without closing for all of your vowels. Repeat until you can do it. Now sing a phrase of one of your songs \u2013 and make sure your jaw opens to the same position on all of your vowels. You have to practice this a bunch before it becomes natural \u2013 but the more you do, the sooner this new movement is programmed into your muscle memory. And you might be one of those lucky ones who notice the improvement in the sound right away (it will sound louder and more resonant with less vocal strain). If you don\u2019t, don\u2019t sweat it, you will. It just takes a little practice. You might have some unwanted tension in your neck, jaw and throat muscles \u2013 try loosening them up and try it again. The next time you perform open your jaw more on your vowels, it\u2019s one of my quick singing tips that makes you sound better instantly! 2. \u201cThink down\u201d for high notesWhen you sing a scale, try thinking of the way an elevator works: a heavy weight is attached to a pulley, and as the weight pulls down, the elevator goes up to the higher floors. So, the highest floor is reached when the weight is the heaviest. Similarly, you should use the most \u201cweight\u201d on your highest notes. 3. More power without strainWho doesn\u2019t want more power without strain? This is one of those simple singing tips that\u2019s easy to apply \u2013 easier than the one above. All you have to do is to keep your chin pointed slightly down and your pectoral muscles slightly flexed (sometimes it\u2019s a lot flexed) when you go for more power. Most singers reach forward or lift their chin up to sing with more power. While it may temporarily work, it causes vocal problems. Tipping your chin down not only works better and saves your voice, it actually SOUNDS better! Stand in front of the good \u2018ol mirror. Sing an \u201cah\u201d scale up and down in one phrase (1-2-3-4-3-2-1). Press your chin slightly in (point your chin towards the floor), usually only 1 inch or so. Don\u2019t let your head bob up as you raise pitch \u2013 keep it firmly in place. Go all the way up the scale of your voice keeping this position. Notice how the chin wants to move up as you raise pitch. Keep it planted. This will give you more power and control and eliminate strain. Practice it until it becomes natural! 4. VibratoHere\u2019s a quick tip to get your vibrato working. Stand in front of a mirror; press on your chest with both hands, then raise your chest higher than normal. Take a breath in and then exhale, but don\u2019t drop your chest. Sing one note and hold it as long as possible with your chest raised. Press on your chest halfway through the note (press kind of hard and raise your chest to meet the pressure). Relax the back of your neck and keep your jaw open as you\u2019re singing \u201cahhh.\u201d Imagine the air spinning around in your mouth while keeping your chin tucked down a bit and your chest raised. Keep in mind, overuse of vibrato is not a good thing in contemporary singing (pop, rock and R&B). At the same time, no vibrato is also not a good thing. So, try ending phrases with straight tone, then into a little bit of vibrato. The bottom line is to do what\u2019s best for you. 5. HearFones\u00aeA good vocal tone is not established by singing loudly, it\u2019s established at medium volume. Good tone happens when vocal folds are strong enough to have a good closure but not touch. Releasing too much air creates a \u201cbreathy\u201d tone and releasing too little air creates a \u201cnasal\u201d tone. Unless you\u2019re really going for breathy or nasal as a stylistic choice, somewhere right in between the two is the perfect balance. HearFones\u00ae allow you to really hear yourself and work on your tone at medium volumes. Happy Singing! Hope that helped. ",

            "answer_text": "One. Open your mouth and go for it. Two. Until they sort out whole body transplants then you are going to work with what you\u2019ve got. Three. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve got until it\u2019s thoroughly tested, so to dis your voice at this stage is premature. The human voice, even yours, is THE most valuable musical instrument you can ever own. Forget Vintage Fender, Stradivarius, Steinway, and the rest. So, the question. Depending what you've got under your chin depends what you can eventually sing. A typical human non musical voice has maybe an octave, most have less. You probably have about half an octave. Most ametuer choirs barely scrape two octaves from bass through to soprano. And they get by. That means in non technical terms, that you are going to run out of voice before you run out of song if you don\u2019t choose notes that suit. That is why an instrumentalist like me will ask what key you have. Proper musos will define by their operatic voices. But that\u2019s in your future. So, here\u2019s the thing, I was banned from singing at school. Banned from singing by my good lady wife for 25 years. Then we saw a band with a worse singer than me. She turned to me and said \u2018he\u2019s a worse singer than you are.\u2019 He was. And that was a couple of years ago. It\u2019s no Rags to riches story but I\u2019m happy with what I\u2019ve got, and what I\u2019ve got keeps getting better and broarder as I practice and get more lessons. I have been extremely lucky to join an open to all comers choir. The entrance criteria is basically \u2018are you human?\u2019 The standard we get to is frankly astonishing. The places we play, the cash that we raise for charity. The place we take at the pivotal points in peoples lives. Unbelievable. Maybe a choir isn\u2019t your first choice. So treat it like school. Look up \u2018Sing Me Merseyside\u2019 to see the Choir I\u2019m learning with or if you get access to the BBC look up \u2018Gareth Malone and the Military Wives\u2019 I\u2019ll answer the implied question of \u2018How to choose a choir.\u2019 First, they take anyone. First, the choirmaster plays keys/ piano at the front of the choir at the practices. First, the choirmaster plays keys at the practices. Second, the choirmaster plays keys live at performances. See the point there? Live keyboards. Avoid any choir with backing tapes. That\u2019s harsh, but fair. Why? Because the choirmaster can ping out your note, stop and start part way through words and break every note down into something you can emulate. Tapes can\u2019t. Basically you need a really, really good musician to teach choir. A genius willing to go back to kindergarten. If you cannot get to a place where there are people to teach you, and follow a route like mine, then it\u2019s going to be apps or the internet. There are a lot of apps out there to teach voice. But the learning needs some education beforehand so that may not work. You mention only voice, have you ever played an instrument? Learning an instrument teaches your brain about tone. That is a vital step on the road to vocals. Plus, you won\u2019t end up such a diva if you play as well as sing. But do not be silent. Do not give up. Do not forget to enjoy every note. ",

            "answer_text": "I will answer this from a singer\u2019s perspective. More than anything else, stress harms the voice. So the first thing i\u2019ll recommend is that you ensure you defuse your body of stress. Best ways to do this are: 1. To rest well. If you do not have an adequate amount of sleep, it tells quite easily on the voice. A 6 - 7 hours sleep is usually recommended as the adequate amount per day, but more importantly sleep early, at least before midnight. In fact, the best remedy for a worn out voice is to simply rest. 2. To exercise regularly. You have to understand that singing is both physiological (physical well-being) and psychological (emotional well-being), and physical exercises go a long way in improving these aspects. You emerge with a stronger tone and timbre over time. 3. To keep yourself well hydrated. Doctors recommend at least 8 glasses of water per day. Do not wait until the day of performance to drown yourself in gallons of water, start observing this everyday. Other things I will recommend are: To sign up for vocal classes. There are lots of techniques for maintaining the voice, and it\u2019s usually helpful to have an experienced teacher take you through them on a practical level, and also provide feedback on your improvement. There are also tons of videos on Youtube on the voice, you can always learn a thing or two there.To do vocal warm up exercises before your actual performance. Lip rolls (pushing air through your closed lips to make them flutter and sound like a motorboat), humming, breathing etc. are super helpful. You can find demonstrations of these on Youtube.To pay attention to what goes into your body. Smoking and alcohol consumption (lots of it) are not advisable if you want to maintain a good voice.These are just a few pointers I think should help you (they help me). Remember, as a singer or broadcaster or public speaker or anyone who needs to use the voice professionally, you\u2019re like an athlete, and you need to practice these habits consistently on a daily basis. Then, you will hear and feel your voice improve over time. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Practice makes man perfect. Anything can be perfect with the help of continuous practice and handwork. Singing can also become better with practice and if uh want to join any class for that then go ahead. It will really help you a lot. Other options are also available like if u know the basics of singing or u know any instrument especially piano or Casio or harmonium then u can sing along with any of these instruments. It not only makes your singing perfect and better but also u can find your scale on different songs so that whenever u get a chance to sing a song in public with the background music then you don't need to give your time in deciding your scale and you can easily start your song with good confidence as well. One more thing which can be helpful to make singing better is to listen to songs and after listening, try to sing as similar as possible to that singer in terms of \u2018sur\u2019 and \u2018taal\u2019. But make sure that you are not singing along with listening songs because it is not a right way to learn any song. And many people do so but it is not correct. You first listen to the song and learn it then try to sing in your original pitch and scale by following the \u2018sur\u2019 and \u2018taal\u2019. Because copying the singer's voice or scale or pitch, can spoil ur originality of singing or your unique style of singing. So just follow their \u2018sur\u2019 and \u2018taal\u2019 and sing in your original voice and scale and pitch. When you sing in your own style then you will find your genre of singing and your comfortable pitch and scale for the particular song as well. ",

Here is what I want you to know, read it and think about you Favorite Musician and you will notice it. 1 - Don\u2019t sing with your nose, this will make it sound ugly with many vocals. It\u2019s to rare that it sound good. 2 - Control your feelings when you sing. It\u2019s like an actor who is playing a role in a movie that he have to express his love to his girl. Face expression is not enough, so he have to change his voice and sound like a person who is really in love with his girl but (in the real life) not in the movie only. simply live the moment when you sign and feel the lyrics as it\u2019s really happening with you. and slowly you will be able to connect your feelings with the songs. 4 - Sing different styles, and I don\u2019t mean like Rock, Hiphop or Jazz\u2026etc. shifting music styles is helpful but you need to learn to change the feelings too, Like being very sad Like ( Spies for Coldplay) or whatever happy song you know. Finally\u2026..Here is what i suggest: Get an Instrument, Like a piano or a guitar, Play one note, and imitate this note. Did you notice what i said? Imitate the note. sing in the same way, same feeling of that note. you will feel that you are singing it exactly like as the note you play, the same tone. repeat it for like 30 times, then move to another note, repeat the same process. then try note 1 and 2. and repeat them like (A,B then A,B and so on). and that\u2019s just an opinion, It may be wrong for many people but it worked with me. Hopefully it will help. ",

            "answer_text": "First you need to figure out what your natural range is. When my son tries to sing popular music, he sounds *awful* - but he is the mainstay in the bass section of our choir. And I know a woman who thought for years that she couldn\u2019t sing, because she couldn\u2019t sing soprano - but she\u2019s got a beautiful tenor voice. So experiment a little with vocal range, singing do-re-mi at a variety of pitches until you get to the point where you\u2019re straining to reach the upper registers. Then STOP. You don\u2019t want to damage your voice permanently. Then see how well you can reproduce your favorite kind of music. Can you sing it back note for note? If not, work with it until you can. Then I would find a chorus of some sort. Church choirs are the easiest to find, and not too awfully picky. See what the director can teach you, in terms of sight-reading and choral diction (hint: you don\u2019t pronounce sung words the same way as spoken words). Community choruses are actually quite a bit pickier, in terms of their expectations of singers, but if the idea of a church choir really frosts you, give the community chorus a shot. They might be willing to work with you. The idea is not just to improve your singing, but to improve your overall awareness of vocal music. Choral singing teaches you to focus your attention on your own part, while still listening to the other parts for things like cues (when to come in on your part). The emphasis on choral diction teaches you to appreciate precision in the spoken word as well as the sung word. And of course, the fun of singing with other like-minded persons is unbeatable. ",

            "answer_text": "Keep in mind that not everyone has a naturally \"pretty\" singing voice. But, everyone can improve their singing (and their health) by remembering these things: Breathe with your diaphragm. Your shoulders should not be moving when you inhale this way. Instead of your chest, your stomach should be moving up and down. Practice this for a few minutes and take long deep breaths. Find out your vocal range and type. This will help you know what you are more comfortable with. For men: bass sings low, baritone sings middle, tenor sings high. For women and kids: alto sings low, mezzo sings middle, soprano sings high. Sing more! Sing every single day so you get more practice. Make sure you warm up so you don't strain your voice. Sing scales, sing DEH songs, whatever floats your boat! Don't try too hard or too much. Many people, usually females, love to sing high notes. In my school choir, all the girls are very competitive about how the sopranos are \"better\" than the mezzos or altos. This is a common misconception. Don't strain your voice trying to hit high notes. Try some low notes for a change. You may not be a woman, but remember: it takes a real woman to sing like a man! Become active! Join your town's choir. Audition for a musical. Even karaoke night can be considered experience. I have been in 11 musicals. I participate in my college's drama club, choir and advanced ensemble. You won't get anywhere without taking the first step. Last but not least, I want to talk about voice lessons. I'm no voice coach, but I can tell you right now, my voice lessons changed me for life. Music is so much more than it was to me before. I now have a larger range. I now know how to breathe correctly. There are so many precious things you can learn from voice lessons. Hopefully this was helpful! Never Stop Singing! (: Source: How Can I Sing Well? If you\u2019re trying to really make something out of your voice (whether for fun or to make a living) there\u2019s a difference in learning properly and getting random tips scattered around the internet. That difference is generally friends and family smiling faintly and people actually WANTING to hear you sing.

            "answer_text": "Make sure you have a solid foundation for breath control, diction, posture, and expressivity in your voice. Find a good voice teacher to help you achieve these goals who can assess your voice properly. Lessons should be tailored to meet your individual strengths and weaknesses in your voice. Try to keep a journal to make note of what specifically you are having trouble with in your voice and the sensations you experience when the sound works and doesn't work. Write down these observations in an almost scientific way and then try out some techniques recommended by your voice teacher to rectify bad habits. Note if there is or isn't a difference. Use a recording device so you have a point of reference. Read up on the anatomy of the voice, because it is an instrument and needs to be understood mechanically before it can be controlled and before you can develop educated theories about your own voice and how it may be improved upon. If you are going to practice, practice and practice some more as the previous poster stated please do it in short intervals. No more than 20 mins at a time. Since you are still learning and developing proper technique, any more could harm your voice. Mental practice (imagining the sound and sensations you want) is just as effective so use this to your advantage. Practice proper breath control (abdominal breathing) and posture throughout the day, not just when you practice, so that it becomes habit. This is only scratching the surface of voice - you really need a teacher to guide you and help with your unique vocal needs. ",

You want your words to really mean well and when you sing sing well. The reason why your voice doesn't leave your throat is because you are not focusing your voice to go somewhere. Practise to project your voice about 7 ft away from where you are at. Practise projecting to a large area, a small area, and a small point.(a person\u2026 an a4 paper and a small dot) Practise makes permanence. What you need to do is to stop doing the old things and get to do the new things. The new things are the good and proper techniques Practise breathing as well, my mom and I have genes that prevent us from projecting well. She talks loud at home because the walls of our home is small but when she is outside she speaks soft. Even when she sings. Though she sings well she is hardly heard for her voice. 2 things, projection will change how your voice come out. Breathing will change the tone and the strength of your voice. Practise singing while smiling and you will realise the tone of your voice will change. You will sound happier and better. This will affect your own perception of your voice as you continue to sing.

I may be a professional singer, but there are MANY genres of music out there that I would sound TERRIBLE in. Not only just starting to practice singing along with music you like, I would seek out what sounds like a good fit for your voice. So much of what is a good or a bad singing voice has to do with aesthetics. It\u2019s all very subjective. If you ENJOY singing, don\u2019t let anybody stop you!!! Just like anything worthwhile, a great deal of effort and determination will go a long way. Set reasonable goals, be with other like minded people, and get some people to hear you so you can get honest feedback. Not EVERY style of music requires the commitment of studying with a voice teacher, especially since that is a crap shoot. Some teachers want you to sound a certain way, and it is very hard to determine who is a good or not so good teacher by yourself. If you can get a good recommendation from someone else you trust, I would go with that. Be clear with the teacher what your goals are - and what they are NOT. Most of all: ENJOY THE PROCESS! ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I sing myself, but I am not a trained singer and I don\u2019t intend to sing in a playback way. But what advises I have got as well as well as the researches I have conducted to improve my voice, I will share those with you: Training: A lot of people have advised me to get classical training. I was not interested in the same school of thoughts, as well as I did not really have the time for it, when I started (I was more into self-learning the guitar). But I think, its a gem of an advice and a training is stepping stone as well as a foundation to improve your voice for singing.Practice: Yes, Practice. That is the key to anything you want to perfect. All art need time to practice and further time to polish. So always try to practice as much as you can, and practice with the right techniques (I guess the training part solves the right technique thing).Vocal Warm-up- Yes right. Like you warm-up your body before sports and exercising, your vocal chords also need to be warmed up before singing. So learn about warming-up your vocal chords before practicing and performing. It usually consists of making some weird noises and expression to relax your vocal chords, neck, face, jaw and other muscles. Try with warm-up and without warm-up singing. You will find a difference in smoothness.Taking care of your throat: Well, like all body parts, you need to take care of your throat and voice. Save your throat from the cough and cold, don\u2019t eat or drink things which are not good for your throat health (Alcohol for example), avoid smoking (I was a chain smoker, it affected my voice).Further, you can get in touch with vocal coaches, who actually train you for overall singing, not just teach you techniques of singing. But if you can afford one. Till then use this and the internet. hope this helps!! Thanks for the A2A Jeet Mak . ",

            "answer_text": "These answers are good. Let's be more technical. It would be difficult to tell how you can become a better singer without first assessing your singing technique, listening to the overall tone and fervor of your voice, and knowing what register you've got. However, I can't stress enough how important it is to have a correct singing technique. This will help you further maximize your singing voice, so you may enjoy singing for a very long time.  To sound better, and hear results in your singing voice, you must first learn how your voice works and where in your voice you will locate what you're singing. To become a better singer, there is no cutting corners. Practice daily warm-ups, singing scales. Do them in A,E,I,O,U, and vary the intervals. You can find these warm-ups easily on YouTube.  Another way to become a better singer is NOT to exceed what your anatomy can't resist. This means you will never sing something that's either too high or too low from your natural range. Putting stress on the larynx will only do damage over time. Whitney Houston was a great example of this, although she sounded great, she didn't have the correct singing technique and commonly sang with what's called a High Larynx. This is one of the things you MUST avoid, at all times. With a lot of practice and dedication, you'll be rocking the karaoke! Good luck on your musical journey with your voice! ",

You should probably drink a hot cup of water before singing, especially in the morning. Don't expect to be able to sing well in the morning either. Don't try to sing only in your comfortable vocal range, challenge yourself. Sing the same song in an alto voice, then a soprano. I like to have \"projects\". I'll work on a couple songs until I can sing them almost perfectly. Vocal coaches really aren't needed to be good at singing. Try to talk as much as you can during the day, it works your voice. If you're struggling with a song or hate how it sounds when you sing it, plug your ears and belt it out. It doesn't take YEARS to become a good singer, it just takes a lot of effort. If you stop singing for a week, be prepared to build up your voice again. If you stop singing for a month, be really prepared to build your voice up. Don't sing breathy, you should feel strong vibrations in your throat when you sing. You can practice singing breathy once you're exceptionally good at regular singing. DON'T STOP SINGING! Literally, don't take a break for a few months. ",

            "answer_text": "One of the unique aspects of voice, unlike any other instrument, is that you can't accurately hear what you sound like. You can record yourself and listen back to it, but you still won't necessarily know what needs to change or how to accomplish that. You really need a skilled vocal teacher for that. No one else is going to give you good information on how you are doing and what and how you need to change. It\u2019s kind of like when someone asks \u201cDo these jeans make me look fat?\u201d No one in their right mind is going to answer that question honestly (unless you look just great, but how would you really know). For that kind of honest assessment, you need a good teacher. I\u2019ve been working with a great teacher in Denver for the last year and a half, Adrienne Osborn of Performance High. I guess I always thought I was maybe a good singer, but she has taken me so far beyond anything I could do when I started, I am amazed. Though we have not really worked specifically on increasing my range, I have increased it by at least an octive. The accuracy and power of my singing is way beyond what I could do when I started. I can't guarantee you will have the same results in working with a voice teacher, but I know for myself that I could have never gotten to this point without my teacher. I have to say also, it is really cool to be able to sing almost anything. You may have to adjust the key or alter a song slightly, but it's very liberating to be able to sing all kinds of songs that you never imagined you could sing! It's almost like having a super power! Good luck on your journey and don't get discouraged. It takes time and lots of practice. Like developing any mussel, you have to work it. ",

I can only speak for myself when I say that I never did like my singing voice in the 1990\u2019s, but wanted to improve. I practiced my songs over and over because my own songs were written in keys that I could work with (I don\u2019t have a wide range, so I need to stay in my safe zone). When I drive, I listen to backing tracks and sing over them (while others listen to music, I practice singing). I also match my voice to melodies I pick out on my guitar. There was a particular song I wrote in 1993 that I could never sing properly, so I practiced that one with newer backing tracks for the past 3 years while driving and I can finally hit the notes with an acceptable margin of error, and I look forward to finally making a recording of it. Otherwise, I feel confident singing most songs I write. Here are some examples, but bear in mind I did not use any auto-tune on my voice, so the flaws you hear are just an example of my capability\u2026.but, I have improved a lot over the years by just practicing over and over again:   ",

Then I saw a man who charges twenty times what a voice teacher charges, and I was (needless to say) very glad I did. A good teacher can, in a few minutes, analyze your present way of singing and offer both short-range and long-range ways to improve your voice.   They will get into the basic mechanics of singing, of how your lips, tongue, throat, larynx and all the muscles of your body work together to make beautiful sound happen; they know about diction - how to pronounce your words so that your audience can both understand them and feel the emotional power.  Even if you do \"pop\" and the teacher is classical (or the other way around), they can usually help you a lot.  They will also broaden your horizons into understanding of all sort of music, and challenge you with ideas you hadn't thought of. ",

            "answer_text": "Hey there! Singing is an activity, probably every human would have tried atleast once in their life, regardless of how they sing. Some become celebrities, some learn singing/vocal skills, some sing for themselves, and some restrict them to bathroom singing.  Did you know, that all humans are gifted with the exact same vocal skills, and the only thing differentiating them from one another, is the amount of PRACTICE? Surprised, aren't you? So was I when I read this. And this is a proven fact! Nobody is 'gifted' with a beautiful voice, It depends on you how you wanna nurture this voice, to make it sound gifted! [JUST WANNA ADD - the quality or the pitch of our voices maybe different, based on our genetics and hormones, but the baseline of vocal capabilities are almost the same for all] When I read this, (about a few years back) I was awe struck. I couldn't believe it. Were they actually telling me, that 9 years of my Hindustani classical training had almost become a waste because I stopped practicing since I had to join Med school? (Since cracking the entrance is no joke, and it consumes most of your time and your optimum teen years :'( ) I was shattered! Totally destroyed. And I know what you are gonna say, There is always time for something, you are really passionate about! And I am not disagreeing at all!!! I just regretted it, that's all I am saying. Anyway from that day on, I promised myself, that I would practice atleast 2\u20133 days a week. I was more passionate about western vocals than Indian vocals \u2014\u2014 so I did, what I was taught in my 1 month western vocals training. Some of the few vocal excercises included singing the octaves in a progressive manner, using your stomach\u2014to sing in a deeper voice, breathing excercises, approximating your lips, and pushing air out from inside such that they vibrate and singing octaves in that manner etc.--------- I guess you get the drill. You can find any of these vocal excercises on YouTube these days. It ain't that difficult! Anyway, I practiced and I practiced, and then I got some oppurunities to sing in my college, and then was chosen for intercollege competitions, (which I didn't win initially), but with more practice, I gained more confidence, and I started winning. Here are a few pictures, you can see how I have progressed, and I'm sure you can see the difference in my confidence!      I have a YouTube channel now. I may not have a ton of subscribers on it, but I sure as hell am proud of what I was and what I have become. Wanna know why? Because I know PRACTICE is what has brought me here, and I know if I can manage to give a little more time each day, I can be much better than what I am right now. It's just a matter of time, and sincerity! Just have faith in yourself and your hard work, and you will surely get there! I just wanna conclude with this last picture of mine, where I won the competition :)  Take care and keep those vocal cords vibrating! \ud83c\udf08\u2665\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "Think about what you want to improve, hear how you want to sound like, and sing that way. More seriously, though, if you are serious about it, get a teacher. That said, possibly the best teacher I had to some extent advocated things not far from my first sentence. Harold Hill\u2019s think system has a surprising amount of validity. Lilian used to say, you shouldn\u2019t listen to yourself, but you should hear what you want to sound like before you sing. It was a great relief to get back to the artistry than can be lacking in more mechanical approaches. I vividly remember listening to another student of another teacher, who was pleased to have finally mastered proper breathing, but realising that though she sounded like she had had lessons, she didn\u2019t sound good. If you sound somewhat good already, get a teacher who will build on that and be suspicious of one that tells you that you are doing it all wrong - even though at some level there will be truth in that. Oh and if a teacher tells you that you will never progress unless you go to his pet kind of psychotherapy, run away very fast, especially if all his other students are doing it. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to be a bit of a black sheep. DO copy others, but NOT when you perform, unless you\u2019re supposed to be imitating someone. Trying to sing like your favorite singers (without pushing in an attempt to go beyond your range) is a fun way to improve your own style and uniqueness. I guarantee you about 99.9999% of professional singers have done this despite what their teachers told them. Now, onto the actual technique. Making it sound powerful (and protecting your voice from damage). Get a full body mirror and stand to the side. You want to put one hand on your chest, and one on your stomach. Puff out your chest as much as you can without being goofy. Drop your shoulders too. Now inhale. Only your bottom hand should move. Exhale. Only your bottom hand should move. Repeat. Making it sound pretty. Yawn. Or the next time you yawn, pay attention to what the roof of your mouth does. Try to recreate that. If that is difficult, open your mouth two fingers wide, keep your fingers in there, and try saying \u201cYada, yada, yada\u201d without biting your fingers off. You feel that pressure in the back of your mouth? Do that every time you sing. It\u2019ll help you stay on pitch and it will open up your resonance. Making it sound prettier. Say sing, now say sinnnnnnngggggggg. The \u201cng\u201d sound is the key to opening up the nasal cavity. Sing a note on \u201cng\u201d and feel your face with your hand, you should be letting air go through your nose, not blocking it off from your nose. You should feel vibrations in your face, at least in your nose. Try and keep this vibration in your face even when you aren\u2019t singing \u201cng\u201d. Well, that about wraps it up. Anyone else?

            "answer_text": "If you are a complete beginner and want to learn to sing by yourself then you can start by singing the scales for one octave up and down to train your voice to be in tune. Then start doing variations. For example: Start by singing the notes C D E F G A B C and then back again C B A G F E D C then do the variations like C D E..D E F\u2026E F G\u2026F G A\u2026G A B\u2026A B C\u2026and back again. There are many other variations like C D E C D E D E C D C E D E D C\u2026 and continue in this pattern. Another one is C D C E D E C D F E\u2026 and continue the pattern. These will make your voice stable and train it to be in tune. Use the piano or any such instrument to make sure your voice is at the correct pitch and not lower or higher than the required note. Sing these variations in a slow speed and gradually increase the speed. You will become more comfortable as you practice. You can also make some variations of your own. For the beginning you can do this. This will not only make your voice stable but also will help you in doing vocal runs as your speed increases. Make sure you sing with the correct technique. Imagine as if you are singing with whole body and not just your throat. Feel the vibrations in your whole body. The feeling should be relaxing and not at all strained while singing. There are many more things that I cannot explain in writing though. You can watch YouTube\u200b videos on the channel of Felicia Ricci. She explains really well and has got numerous tutorials on singing. You can learn other technical aspects about singing in that channel. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "When looking to improve your singing voice, many general tips should be followed that can help more or less anyone get a bit of extra quality from every note they attempt to hit. What, though, are some of the most useful tips to help improve singing quality & consistency? Thinking Down A classic tip for improving your vocal quality as a singer is to pay attention when singing high notes. When you try to hit a high note, try and think of it that your voice is supposed to go down when you hit a high note. Basically, when you think of hitting a high note, think of it as adding extra weight to something \u2013 like an elevator, the weight is heaviest when the elevator reaches the top. The more resistance you can add to your voice when hitting those high notes, the better. Adding Power Another useful tip is to add power without straining the body. Try and keep your chin pointed down the way and your pecks a touch flexed this allows you to create a natural shape to help boost vocal power. If you want a more natural vibration in your sound, then push down on your chest with both hand and then raise your chest higher than you would normally. This helps as it allows you to take in a deep, thick breath without the chest sagging. Do this, hold a single note, and do so with the chest raised out \u2013 you should notice a big difference, especially if you push-down on your chest half-way through the notes elongation.

When you make a recording make sure to listen to it afterwards and pay attention to your own voice do you sound out a pitch do you enunciate your words properly? do certain words come up pronounced strange? The process of training your own voice takes a long time but you can do it what you were looking out for is to make sure that your own voice doesn't bother you when you hear it. if it annoys you, you need to change your voice need to change the way you sing until when you can listen to your voice and not be bothered by it and you'll know that you're singing pretty good it'll take everyday 4 the better part of two or three years to do this. heres a clip of me. i trained my voice back in 2007 -2010 and ive been a lead singer since 2011 .

            "answer_text": "As a singer and a musician who has been taught to sing and taught others to sing, here are my top tips: Breathe correctly. Think of the air bypassing your lungs and getting pulled down into your abdomen. If your stomach expands when you breathe in, you\u2019re doing it correctly. This helps to support the notes and gives you a nice, full sound.When learning a song, look at the notes. This seems like a no-brainer, but it\u2019s not something singers always do. I once had a young student who was really struggling with a solo. She also played piano, so I knew she could read music. I told her to think of her voice like a musical instrument, and to read the notes as she sang. The change was almost instantaneous. That one tip helped her tremendously, and she was easily able to hit notes she\u2019d struggled with before.Hear the next note in your head before you sing it. This one kind of goes along with #2, but it is a little trickier to master. But if you can do it, it really helps. It physiologically primes your vocal chords to sing the next note in tune.Once you know the song, feel it. As you\u2019re learning a song, it\u2019s very important to focus on technique and precision, but once you\u2019ve practiced it and you know it, let expression take over. Let those crescendos and decrescendos come, let your voice crack\u2014 take the music out of the drivers seat and let your emotions do the talking. An imperfect solo sung with feeling will beat a perfectly sung emotionless solo every single time.",

            "answer_text": "You should probably go to a very tough and well qualified teacher and have at least one lesson. He/she can tell you whether you\u2019ve got any issues that may prevent you from becoming a good singer. That\u2019s pretty important because there\u2019s nothing more tragic than a deluded singer who\u2019s destined to be mediocre at best. You can\u2019t trust anyone you know. They\u2019ll either pamper you with compliments or cut you down for fun (or because they\u2019re jealous). So start with an objective person who knows what they\u2019re talking about. If you have the voice, a good teacher can make you an able singer. Great singers have something special that can\u2019t be taught, but learning the techniques will at least give you a foundation. The exception, of course, is rock. I\u2019m not saying you don\u2019t have to be able to sing, but attitude and personality goes a long way in rock, punk, metal etc, and you usually know if you\u2019re a good enough singer because the band will simply get rid of you if you\u2019re not up to standard.

When you practice, you need to take it even farther than usual.",

Your body should not be tilted to one side or the other. Make sure your head isn't tipped back or forwards.Learn to breathe from your diaphragm. Correct breathing is one of the most important things when singing. When you breathe, make sure you are taking air from your diaphragm instead of your chest. This means when you breathe in, your abdomen will expand instead of your chest. When you sing, you will push down on the diaphragm when you ascend a scale and release when you come back down the scale.Supporting your voice with the diaphragm is one of the keys to singing. To practice, place a hand on your stomach and inhale through your nose. Your abdomen should expand and jut out when you breathe in. Your chest should not move out or up. As you exhale, push down and contract the abdominal muscles. It should feel like doing a sit up. Repeat until this is natural when you are singing.3. Open your vowels: One quick way to improve your singing is to open your vowels. This is called open throat technique. To achieve this, start by saying \"ah\" or \"uh.\" Elongate your mouth without widening it. You want to separate your tongue from your soft palette and keep them separated while you sing. Your tongue should be against your bottom jaw. This gives you better quality. Try saying A-E-I-O-U. Your jaw should not close on any of those. If you can't keep your jaw down, use your fingers to pull it down. Keep repeating the vowels until you can say them with your mouth open.Sing the vowels. Keep the jaw open while you sing them like you did while saying them. Then sing a phrase and open the jaw when you sing each vowel.This will probably take some practice to achieve, but it will help improve the quality of your singing.By doing this you can start to grow your voice.4. Tilt your chin down: When you are singing higher notes and trying to get power, keep your chin pointed down. Your head has a tendency to move up as you sing higher notes, which can cause problems to your vocal chords. Singing while focusing on keeping the chin down helps give your voice more power and control. 5. Extend your vocal range. First, you must find your vocal range. After you have done that, you can begin to increase your vocal range. To do this, you must have proper technique. You must have non-airy vowels and proper resonance in your voice before you try to extend your vocal range. To extend your vocal range, do it a half-step or full step at a time. Practice with short scales and get comfortable singing that new note properly before trying to push your voice any higher or lower.Taking lessons from a vocal coach is the safest, most effective way of increasing your range.",

            "answer_text": "It is important to identify your sound and not try to sound like anyone else, learn to love your instrument. While there are some things that you can change, there are many which are you and should not be changed. There are several aspects of the voice that can change the color and the beauty of the sound, the timber, brightness, raspiness and color.  Timber. besides your natural timbre, some vibrato and added support on sustained tones will make the voice richer. Try to vocalise on a single note with a clear vowel while slowly increasing and diminishing the tone. It is important that you breath deeply to support the sound.  Raspiness. listen to some trumpet players until you are able to hear the change in sound based on if any air is \"leaking\".Think about this with your vocal chords, if the sound is escaping your voice will sound raspy.  It is important to work with someone that could help you clean up the sound of your voice by keeping your vocal chords closed around the sound and providing just the right air support. Brightness. darker sounds are more classic, brighter sounds are often less trained. The shape of your vowels and your posture will influence your sound, the position of your chin and shape of your mouth. Good luck ",

            "answer_text": "You are - and always will be - your own worst critic. So keep in mind, you may not be as bad as you think you are. But if you are as bad as you think you are, and you are serious about getting better, the first step should be lessons from a vocal coach. Check their references and testimonials from former students. If you don\u2019t want to pay for lessons, you can join a community or church choir. They will take you, and might help you improve. My tips for getting better on your own: Ensure you support your tone. Breathe deep, and when you sing, your diaphragm (abdominal muscles that push the air out) should be contracted and solid; not to force the air out, but to steady the airflow. A solid foundation will always improve the quality, for both vocal and wind instruments. Yes, your singing voice is an instrument, just like a trumpet, saxophone, or flute. Treat it as such: Warm up before practicing/performing. Sing long tones to practice holding pitches. Practice scales, intervals, etudes. Work the fundamentals, polish them. Musicians call it \u201cwoodshed-ing\u201d, and it pays off. Good luck! ",

The Simple and most efficient tip for a better voice is to understand your tonal nature (shruthi) and build your voice on that. Once you understand the comfort zone of your tonal range, practice several days on the same, you\u2019ll be able to feel the improvement in your tonal clarity. And once you get that confidence, practice on upper and lower ranges to make your tone/timber more flexible. Follow this and people (why people/others?? because we will not like our own voice that easily..) will start like your voice. Remember\u2026 the timber/tone of Hariharan\u2019s (smooth and silky) and Kailash Kher\u2019s (raw and powerful) voice is extremely different\u2026 but both are wonderful singers despite this\u2026 Love, Aswin.

If you are singing lieder, or choral stuff - you need a teacher, but if your are a budding singer guitarist or singing in front of a band, just understand that some of the most famous and regarded singers were never that great at singing anyway. However, especially in the folk, Americana, blues and country genres got highly regards because they are/were great story tellers. I suggest that you go to a few \u201copen mics\u201d or folk or whatever where you might see a number of eager amateurs and/or semi-pros and critically evaluate which ones bore you and which ones catch and hold your attention. When you sing - you sing not for yourself but primarily of your audience. Singing lyrics whether yours or a cover of someone else\u2019s song is far more than singing in tune - it is telling a story convincingly so that your audience can hear you clearly and are captivated by your words. It IS essential to learn how to breathe - lots of stars you see on TV or whatever haven\u2019t learnt that - your voice is a wind instrument (I\u2019ll compare it to bagpipes) and you need to \u201cfill your airbag properly which means learning to fill the bottom of your lungs which few people do unless they are entirely puffed out. This is a simple technique - and NOT a difficult thing - people talk about your diaphragm and they are right. Learn about this. This is a don\u2019t! DON\u2019T try to sing like your hero! Pinch their song if you want, but sing it as if it was YOUR story, and you are telling your story with conviction. Another don't - Don\u2019t think that you have to sing the song in the key you heard it. Find the key that enables you to sing the highest and the lowest notes in the melody easily. Yet another don\u2019t - don\u2019t sing too fast a tempo, you\u2019ll trip over the syllables. Last don\u2019t - Many untrained amateurs hear and want to sing songs with great melodies - remember that the more melodic - the more difficult it is to sing, that why the crooners were such artists. Take some time to look listen to people like Johnny Mathis, Sarah Vaughn and more recent singers like Michael Buble, Adele, Jamie Cullen, Diana Krall and Norah Jones. I\u2019d also recommend listening to people with less than perfect voices who also get though to large and appreciative audiences due to their storytelling abilities : Johnny Cash, Kris Kristofferson. Willie Nelson, and Guy Clark:  ",

Vocal fry is always relaxed and crackly, very effortless. 127% of your focus should be on keeping the crackle feeling as you sing your vowel. Of course when you sing, the crackling will eventually be substituted with a clear note. However, the vibrating & resonating effect of the crackling needs to be alive under the note.

If so, I can't help, I'm useless at that. If it's timing and phrasing, practice with a metronome, then listen to Willie Nelson and Frank Sinatra, and notice how they enhance the emotional impact by straying from the beat. Better pitch control? Practice with drone tones, and spend more attention on listening rather than on making the sound. Better dynamics, or emotional impact? Read the lyrics, meditate on the lyrics, their meaning and the emotions. Remember that an effective singer is, essentially, an actor. You're trying to bring those words to LIFE. Don't recite them, FEEL them. I don't know what kind of music moves you, but if you like country or bluegrass, I'd urge you to dig into the catalogs of John Duffey and Emmylou Harris. Both were/are masters of using breath control, timbre control and vibrato/tremolo in the service of the story in the song; despite the fact that Emmylou has some of the worst diction ever to grace a slab of vinyl.

Well, by correct practice I mean practising in the right direction, practising the right kind of things etc. Correct practise is only possible if you practice from right source as well as experiment with yourself is also important. If you want to sing better first thing is that you should maintain your vocal. So, it is important to do warm up exercises for your vocal cords before singing songs. Warming up will help you to make your vocal ready for singing. So, do atleast one or two warm up exercises before you start singing songs.  Next, is that you should listen to great singers and try to understand their style and technique of singing. Try to observe and learn from their songs. It is a great way which will help you to learn so many things and you will surely see development in your singing.  Also you can record your voice and listen to it, this will help you to point out the mistakes that you are making in your singing and not to repeat them in future. So, record your song, and do listen it carefully and correct your mistakes. This is one of the great ways to improve your singing. ",

            "answer_text": "Every morning, do this- here in India we say it as \u201c \u2018Sa\u2019 ka riyaz\u201d. What we do in that is take a musical note(change everyday) sing it as either 'saaaa' or 'aaaa', basically sustain the as much as u can. Take deep breath, say 'saaaa' in particular note, until that breath is over(don't force your breath, make it naturaly): this exercise helps you have control on your voice, have sustainability, & after some exercise, your voice won't shake.Vocal runs: sing \u2018Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Nee Sa' or \u2018Do Re Mi Fa Sow La Ti Do'\u2026 sing it from slow to fast\u2026. Sing it in different combinations. This helps you avoid singing in off tune, & help you sing in tune. & Also helps to sing vocal runs.After those two exercise, take a particular classic song, wether it be Indian, or Western. Listen to it, listen to it in very detailed manner, every Melody, every runs, vibrato, every ups & downs, everything\u2026 listen to them very clearly few times\u2026 then start singing it, start comparing yourself to it, be honest & see where you have to work on. Practice those parts, start slowly first, then gradually increase the pace. Change the song everytime you think u have completed the previous one.Do this daily, at least a full year to get very good hold on it. Many people take years to become perfect, it all depends on the interest of learning, how much time you give to it, & your commitment on it. Good Luck I Hope my answer has helped you. Thank you ",

            "answer_text": "To make your voice sound better for singing, there are several ways that you can do, which include as follows:  Learn the correct breathing technique from the diaphragm and not the shallow one from the chest. This will allow you to have better support for your pitch as well as a good tone quality. Never place your voice on the throat while singing. This will not only affect your tone quality but also ruin your vocal cords in the long run due to excessive unnecessary strain. Do not sing songs that are way beyond your vocal range if you have not had the adequate technique to do so yet. If you have to, either replace the key or change the arrangement to fit your voice altogether. Do not do Michael Bolton or Whitney Houston if you have not learnt the required technique to sing their songs, which are often very physically challenging. Drink plenty of water because hydrating your vocal cords is extremely important. However, try to avoid cold water before any important performances such as a concert or a big gig since it can tense up your vocal cord muscles a little. Know the lyrics that you are singing well. In this way, you will be able to relate to them more and will not sound like your average karaoke singer.",

            "answer_text": "Breath with your diaphragm, pulling and pushing your lungs from below your stomach. Once you\u2019ve got that down, practice circular breathing by inhaling through your nostrils as you exhale from your mouth. You might not master this, but practicing improves your all around breathing skills. Practice making the loudest sound you can using the least breath; this will beef up your chords. For higher notes, try broadcasting through your nose as well, and avoid tilting your head backwards. This is a good cheat, but it takes a heavy toll on your chords. If you write your own lyrics, constantly speak them aloud. You want to flow: meter, cadence, phrasing. Watch for accents or consonants that hitch or stop in a line, and look for alternatives. Having a thesaurus at hand is a good idea, and some formal study of poetry is even better. Reciting Shakespeare is incredibly helpful too; that iambic pentameter is fucking brilliant. You don\u2019t even need to know what the words mean as long as you pronounce them correctly. That old English is actually much easier to understand when you hear it in context. If you\u2019re covering someone else\u2019s material, try doing an impersonation while you\u2019re learning the words, then switch to your natural voice. If you haven\u2019t fully developed it yet, try impersonating someone who sounds totally different than the original singer. If your plan is to be a front(wo)man, unencumbered by an instrument, keep your visual appeal in mind. You don\u2019t necessarily have to dance per se, but you should try to incorporate some movement into your performance. This will in turn require practicing such movement, as it will affect your breathing and delivery. I did it for twenty years, post-punk-metal-rock & roll hollering on key sorta style. I started when I was 15 (playing live and all that) and being self-taught amidst pubescent was okay, since it actually altered my physical shape (great big mouth, the torso of a 6\u20192\u201d man on the legs of a 5\u20198\u201d one) and made breathing & such second nature. Any older and some amount of formal training would be prudent, I believe. Oh yeah, no amount of practice can prepare you for what happens in a recording studio. Unless of course that\u2019s where you practice! I won\u2019t offer up advice on that, since I always kinda hated it and never felt like it was quite right in the end. That\u2019s when you find out things like your big-ass boot lips are incapable of making a \u2018P\u2019 or a \u2018B\u2019 sound without \u2018popping\u2019, which spikes the level and blurs the immediately following syllables. Hope I\u2019ve shaken some tasty acorns from my tree of knowledge, and happy hollering! ",

But what you should practice? Breathing. Proper breathing equal good singing. While you are singing you should use your diaphragm. The diaphragm is an important muscle that helps you breathe in and out. If you want to train this muscle just lay on your back and breath. Laying on your back forces your diaphragm to work.Pitch training. First of all, you have to sing on a good pitch. To improve that skill you can play a scale on a piano and sing single notes. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t have a piano, you can download a piano app on your mobile device. If you can\u2019t play you can just press random keys and imitate sounds by your voice. That exercise will help you to always hit the right note while you are singing. Listen to yourself and ask yourself a question '' Am I sound right?'Warm up. You can do all that professional vocal warmups exercises like \u2018\u2019lip trills\u2019\u2019 or tongue trills. But you can sing a few of your favorite songs and it will warm you too.",

Also, you can share vocal exercises.Be open to criticism.Join choirs, school choruses, or singing groups to be around other singers so you can learn.Try singing along to a song you like and keep practicing until you get it.If you keep feeling like you're out of breath, try exercising your diaphragm and lungs. This will make them stronger, allowing you to sing longer without breaths.If you're nervous, close your eyes and imagine you're singing by yourself - sing like nobody is there.Try adjusting your pitch if it just doesn't seem right.

If you are in school ,hence the age thought, by all means try out for choir if you are not already singing there. Also at any age join a local church choir. Look around for the one that has a bonafide choir director. Volunteer directors are wonderful dedicated but some do not have a background in voice, just a strong love of music. Look in your are to see if there are any choral singing groups. Now I am not pushing choir on you, but experience is a great teacher so singing more and with others is a good step. If you are an adult, I would also suggest a vocal coach. Look to your local colleges and universities and you will likely find someone that teaches. The voice is an instrument and must be developed with practice and guidance like any oither instrument. Best wishes! ",

Background: it appears beneficial, though not crucial, to come from a musical background, both for a potentially inherited advantage (\u2018nature\u2019) but definitely by being surrounded by music growing up (\u2018nurture\u2019). Preparation (\u2018building the vocal instrument\u2019): vocal technique needs to be optimised by practicing efficiently, preferably under instruction from a reputable, effective singing teacher/vocal coach to know what & how to practice with the view to developing a robust, agile, responsive instrument. [1] A great singer also needs to keenly understand how music works, how the singing role fits in the larger music contexts they\u2019ll be operating in and to develop creativity, musical taste & finesse. Performance (\u2018playing the vocal instrument\u2019): singing & performing regularly, preferably in a range of contexts for versatility, builds skill & craft over time. I would also add that it\u2019s important to keep the reasons why we sing at the forefront of our minds. The singers with the greatest impact & longevity are those who seek/sought to be true to themselves, to share something honest & substantial, to uplift & inspire and not simply serve the ego.

To answer in more depth, there are a couple of ways to look at it\u2026 Have you ever listened to a digital representation of \u2018singing\u2019? I can plug a song into my notation software and assign a \u2018voice\u2019 sound to it, and while the sampling makes the voice sound quite good by itself, when I hit play and the software plays every note and rhythm correctly it still sounds terrible. Why? Because machines don\u2019t have a soul and soul is what makes singing so beautiful. Even the best, most accomplished singers on the planet are not perfect. But the little imperfections are what make their voices unique. Small errors may be undetectable to the untrained ear, and end up making each performance a totally unique experience. The \u201cperfect\u201d performance you may be trying to emulate is definitely not perfect. There is always room for growth as an artist, always room for improving your skill as a singer, no matter how good you are. This is why the most accomplished singers still work with a vocal coach even when they\u2019re at the top of their game. I have been singing for over 30 years, and teaching voice for nearly 20, I sing professionally as both a soloist and in ensembles and I am FAR from perfect. But the point is, you don\u2019t have to be, and can\u2019t be\u2026 perfection is an impossible standard to hold oneself to in any field. Instead of worrying about trying to be perfect, focus on improvement. Find a coach with whom you really click. Someone who \u2018gets\u2019 you and who speaks your musical language. It may take a few tries to find the right person, but it is well worth the effort. Then sing, sing, sing! Take every opportunity you are offered. Sing different genres. Go outside your comfort zone. Then, when people pay you compliments on your singing take them to heart. Allow their kind words to build up your confidence, to give you the strength to keep working and continue growing, but don\u2019t let yourself become complacent or egotistic. Remember that no matter how many people tell you you\u2019re great, there is always going to be someone better. Strive to get better yourself and work your tail off. But let go of \u201cperfect\u201d it\u2019s just an illusion anyway. ",

Everywhere. I became good at it by singing regularly, singing songs that I enjoyed singing (all from rhythm games because, well, I don\u2019t really enjoy modern music). Also, record yourself to keep track of your progress. This, I never did, but I learnt my lesson. One day, (well today actually) I recorded my singing to Kat Penkin\u2019s Fight Another Day and braced myself to listen. It was a pleasant surprise! My voice was no longer shaking, and the notes were clear and in tune. For me, that is a miracle. For my sister, it\u2019s a cinch. (No, I am not sharing that recording\u2026yet.) My singing is not the best in the world. But now it actually sounds good. To be honest, I never heard my voice changing. But comparing two recordings\u2026 oh wow.

            "answer_text": "I suggest you question yourself further, starting with the basic one - \u201cWhy do I want to train my voice\u201d. Maybe there will be more than one answer. If so, then take time, to experience several different forms of voice training - there are many. And they are not only for singing, which you do not specify, so I assume you fundamental wish is to train your voice as a source of sound. And that is a great place to start from, though not so easy to find a teacher who is not working within the frame of a given cultural approach, or method, or tradition\u2026. From developing the accepted, expected, required kind of sound and range for a particular form of singing (like that of a particular religion, or folk tradition) to that of an actor in one of the many forms and styles of theatre that exist in the world. The training I experienced with Roy Hart, 40 years ago was uniquely that. It became known, but us members of his group of students, as simply THE HUMAN VOICE, in all its colours, ranges, textures and complexity! The more specialised uses of the voice, such as in choral singing, within one of the classical ranges, such as Baritone or Contralto, are just one of many specialised uses. It is true that some individuals are gifted with a beautiful vocal quality in one of those narrow ranges, and it is a legitimate decision to work within. My conclusion then, is to find a teacher who has explored his/her own voice/s from a Roy Hart Teacher, or 2nd and 3rd generation teacher, as most of the original ones have passed on. Go to goggle search and see what comes up! I wish you well in your research. ",

If you cannot do that, because of location, research teachers online and find a teacher with a very good reputation who is willing to give you lessons over Skype. If you can't afford voice lessons, try looking for a teacher who will let you take 15, 30, or 45 minute lessons at a discount (rather than a full hour each week). Or go once every two weeks. Or go once a month. Once you have a teacher, make sure to ask them to give you exercises that you can do on your own. Then do them. Every day, if you can. If you simply want to learn to sing in tune, try joining a local choir. Most churches have choirs that anyone can join, and the other singers will be glad to help you. Don't rely on YouTube videos or online voice teachers to learn how to sing. You can really damage your voice that way; you need a qualified teacher to listen to your voice and identify any bad habits! ",

Open your mouth and make an \u2018ng\u2019 sound, it should sound a bit like a hum. When you do this, you exercise your vocal chords and throat without using them in the sense of singing a normal \u2018ah\u2019 always do your scales first with the \u2018ng\u2019 sound first. And to prepare myself I like to do octave jumps with the \u2018ng\u2019 sound. This helps me a lot to get ready to hit notes at the top of my range without struggle and to make them sound more clear. My vocal instructor also has a variety of scales using different vowel sounds and different numbers of syllables. For example we start with two syllables and an \u2018ah\u2019 sound and an \u2018oh\u2019 sound, then three syllables with an \u2018ee\u2019 sound and an \u2018aa\u2019 sound. Then so on. And he has me tighten my chest and diaphragm and hold it to work it before I sing. We do this EVERY TIME and it really helps. Just some tips! ",

            "answer_text": "\"Ah Music, Better than any magic we do here\" - Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter Series. Music however it is, is divine and considered to be wonderful Practice makes a man perfect! I will share my experiences with you.   First I take this forum to thank all my guru's who have shaped me into who I am. I have only learnt music to quench my thirst of a new hobby! \"Endaro Mahanubhavulu, Andariki Vandanamulu\" (There are many great people, I bow down in reverence to all of them, - Pancharatna Kriti, Saint Thyagaraja) Any music can be only produced if you are comfortable with the lyrics of the song. I make it a habit to write the notation and the song itself (yes, using a pen and a book). It makes you retain much of the song.Next start with the meaning the lyricist of the song is trying to convey. Most of the times, the song comes out best if you understand the meaning of the song and modify your voice accordingly.Make it a point to listen to as much music as you can and start guessing the notation so that the notation sticks in your brain.Practice hard on the basics and you will see that the harder you practice the basics the better you will get. Since most of Indian Music is available on CD's/ on the net, you can download and listen to the intricacies involved in the particular song that are expounded beautifully by many exponents. Practicing along with the recordings is a great way of learning.More edits on their way if I remember something else. Till then Happy Singing! ",

For now, I'm assuming two things. First that you're interested in pop music. And second is that for you- Bad means not a sweet/sexy/whatever-you-want voice: Since it is your natural voice, you can't do much about it. You can try using various voice modulations. But i recommend you stick to your natural voice. Try finding a style that suits you. There have been singers with not so good voices but have had great careers.Bad means you don't know how to sing: Well that isn't even a problem! Like any skill, singing can be learnt. Start today!

Record yourself and try to identify problems that you can work on. For example, if your pitch isn\u2019t great, you can work on that specifically. Likewise, if it is power or control or decent phrasing that is somewhat lacking, or all three, you can work on those things. Sometimes people have bad technique that they need to get rid of, like a strange, unnatural vibrato or way too much breathiness. If this is the case, then it is important to have a teacher or someone who knows what they are talking about to point this out to you and help you overcome it. Simply practicing a lot more with severely flawed technique will get you nowhere and may actually be counterproductive. ",

            "answer_text": "To learn anything well, you must have an excellent instructor and be a devoted student. It is, of course, easier to learn when you are younger. Generally speaking, you don\u2019t have as many obligations ( full time job , family to support, college etc. ) as when you get older. Also your range diminishes as a function of aging; if you can sing high now, in a natural voice, take lessons and do your vocal exercises daily. That being said, take a song or two that you love and practice them whenever you can. Record them and listen to them intently as you play them back. Take notes on what needs improving and make sure you work on it. Listen to your earlier recordings and compare them to your latest recordings every few weeks. You\u2019ll be amazed what lessons, practice time and diligence will do to improve your singing. Last, but most important, after you do all of the mechanics listed above, learn songs you love and make them yours. Practice them with and without accompaniment. Most popular songs are available as karaoke on internet streaming music services. If you do all of this, and love it while doing it, you may never become a Frank Sinatra or whoever you idolize as a singer. That\u2019s not important anyway. The whole point is be the best YOU that you can be! That goes for every facet of your life, including singing. ",

The reasons I say this is: Our ears differentiate notes in any composition (Any system or genre of music) whether reproduced through our vocal cord or an instrument based on a specific sound frequency. For e.g. 440 MHz is the note C. As long as you hit the right frequency, no matter how your voice is, you would sound exactly same!We are all gifted with different texture and a unique voice which is our single most advantage and differentiator. No one else can replicate your individual voice texture. So it preserves your individuality!There are numerous examples of highly acclaimed and revered musicians who were known for their unique voice. Who knows - you could become world renowned for the very same voice that are looking at changing right now!I am sharing a link to some very well known vocalists who are also my favourites and were often mocked for their voice which indeed they converted into their biggest strengths ever. MD Ramanathan - He was someone who redefined the concept of shruti in carnatic classical music as he had a very base vocal tone which was considered unpleasing during his times. This very quality of his voice later went on to become his single largest advantage towards his journey in the history of Indian Classical Music as the \u201cMusician\u2019s Musician\u201d. M. D. Ramanathan - WikipediaSSI - Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer - Considered the great Bhisma of Carnatic Classical Music, he is another carnatic vocalist who was not blessed with an attractive voice, but with his practise and constant efforts redefined the meaning of music once and for all. Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer - WikipediaLou Reed: His half talking, half singing drawl with the Velvet Underground created a new rock templateFlorence Foster Jenkins, Bob Dylan and many othersWhat I mean to say is, look at what is it that you have got and work on your strengths to make it your individual identity and style. What you go, no one else has! ",

There are no \u201cbad\u201d voices. You may not have a voice that society is going to exhault, but who cares? Sing anyway. Join a community choir, or if you attend church, a church choir. Seek out some vocal lessons. Start listening to all generes of music and listen to all the different vocal styles. Maybe pop music isn't where your voice naturally fits. Maybe you have more of a blues sound. There are also some training courses for understand how the voice produces sound and then manipulating the vocal folds to create different kinds of sounds. The one I am most familar with is Estill voices training. Listen and sing, rinse and repeat. Everyone can sing. ",

Tom Waits, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan and others I could mention would not stand out as \u201camazing singers\u201d technically, but they are beloved just the same. Mark King of Level 42 and Morrissey when he was with The Smiths and his earlier solo material are personal favorites of mine. Neither are technical powerhouse singers, but they work well for their material and fanbase. On another topic, can you \u201ctrain\u201d your voice to be better or more accurate? In some rare cases, no, but most people can, and by practicing and recording yourself and critiquing yourself you can learn to sing better. Even with that, think about the material you want to perform and if your voice and emotive quality will enhance or diminish from it. You won\u2019t know until you try :). ",

You can develop your voice to be a good singer by doing practice and learning the real music, a classical music. Consistent practice will give you the results. And it is not necessary that every person with a good voice can be a good singer. Even most successful singers in the film industries also need to practice.

A great deal of sheet music can be purchased on the internet that can be transposed. If you can figure out the right key for the song and find it in a transposable database, then you are halfway there. I also feel that if you really want to improve, then you should buy a digital voice recorder and listen back to it on your computer. I use a Zoom H2, and it has done wonders for me. ",

Nobody would say, objectively, that Tom Waits, Bob Dylan or Bruce Springsteen have gorgeous voices. What they do have (beyond tremendous songwriting talent) are voices that work with the music that they do perform. Janis Joplin didn\u2019t have a great voice. She had a powerful, distinctive one, but it was also harsh and not objectively \u201cpleasant\u201d. However, it was perfect for the bluesy rock that she performed. Find your niche. Whatever the quality of your voice, find the music you love, love performing and can do justice to. Sing with conviction and you can make it work. That\u2019s not to say that you can\u2019t take vocal lessons to improve. Nothing says you can\u2019t learn techniques and skill. It may never give you an objectively \u201cgorgeous\u201d voice to listen to, but it may well help you do justice to the voice you have and make it work. ",

Everything should be done in moderation some more so than others such as, if you\u2019re wanting to work on your whistle voice register or vocal fry then this is recommended to do a small percentage of the time as it\u2019s not used as much and won\u2019t necessarily help with overall vocal technique which is a lot more important. So I say, experiment with your voice and see what feels good and comfortable nothing that is causing you to feel tight and sore as that is a very quick way of knowing to try something else. Also, singing a variety of genres of songs such as classical, pop and so on to begin with as that will help with building your range. ",

It is the sharpening process as much as you do proper riyaaz as much better your singing would be proportionally . Do Aaroh Avroh everyday to better your range. Do sing Alankars these are some essential and very effective things to improve your singing.Do prefer Tanpura and Harmonium for Riyaz : Tanpura is the best instrument for Riyaaz if you don\u2019t have a Tanpura don\u2019t worry there are so many amazing appps on playstore available for those who cant afford or dont know how to play a tanpura :) And Harmonium is also an amazing Instrument for daily Riyaaz.Dont Be Impatient: you have to keep some patience good things take time to happen and you just cant expect to become a master in a week or a month but yeah if you are doing things right mentioned above then for sure within a month you can see the changes and improvement in your singing.So these are few very basic and essential things one should follow even if you are not learning from any music academy these things and youtube will definitely help you to sing better :) Good Luck ",

When you get better at singing you gain much better control over your voice and breath allowing you to improve your range and tone. For specific things, try to open you stance and place your feet shoulder width apart and then clench the muscles in your lower stomach to stabilize your breath. Next open the back of your throat like you do when you have a cold at the doctors. Finally, lift the muscles in your face to open your nasal cavity and channel your sound there while still singing out of your mouth. Do the first two first and once you have those down, move on to the third. With these few tips you should improve your sound a lot but it will take both time and practice, there is no silver bullet that improves your voice overnight. ",

Yes, people sometimes focus a little too much into the technicalities of singing. Others, simply enjoy , e.g, bathroom singers (me being one myself). So my suggestion to you, would be to go visit a singing coach near you, a proper reputed one. Go visit a proper Western or Classical singing coach. They will be able to educate you how to train your vocals more! My biggest, largest, deepest advice is.To simply ENJOY singing. Having a voice and being able to just sing, is one of the blessings a human could have. No matter how technically good you sound. You need and should enjoy it. It\u2019s not about the technicals. It\u2019s all about the Soul. Cheers! ",

It doesn\u2019t matter how well you sing that note, if it is wrong if will clash with the other notes in the chord and it will sound bad. Singing in tune is crucial! 5. Pick songs that are in your vocal range. Go for notes that you know you can hit. Do simple songs really well rather than more difficult songs that contain notes you might not be able to reach. 6. Sing like yourself, not like the recording artist. Your unique voice is what makes you stand out. Just sing like you and don\u2019t try to copy someone else. ",

If you already have one and you feel like you have reached the limits of your improvements then it may be time to find a better one. If you are going for rock or pop, I would search out a teacher who is conversant and capable but can still show you some traditional technique, even bel canto. You will learn habits around breathing and relaxation even if your ultimate goal is to sing with vocal fry on the low-mid end and use your pharyngeal cavity to hit those amazingly high notes. You will find that these abilities come with less effort and strain. Consequently, your vocal health is much more likely to resist afflictions with nodes or irreparable vocal chord damage. Not knowing your level, I\u2019m assuming a student or still in the learning phase and not a full-time pro. But if you were a pro, an occasional lesson won\u2019t hurt either. There\u2019s nothing like a second professional opinion to give you ideas on advancing your skills. I wish you luck in all of your vocal endeavors. Warren Peterson ",

Th air should go in there, and you will feel your core working. Feel this muscle every time you breathe. Lastly, make sure it is a 100% breath. Don't breath short of your maximum. Practice sirens to improve your space. I really don't know how to explain it, as it'd be better shown, but imagine eating a hot french fry. You immediately rapidly breathe in air, because it'll help cool it down. This can help open up your space. You don't want your high notes to sound screechy. Know basic theory. This can help  improve your sightseeing, so you're actually doing it rather than memorizing the notes. If it's plan memorization, you're bound to go flat or sharp in some places. Find an online piano if you don't have one, read the music, so you get the exact pitch. Do exercises to relieve tension, especially in the mouth and neck. Tension often leads to going sharp on pitches, and you should always be relaxed when singing. Control your pitch from your mind, not your throat. Imagine your voice going away from you, and don't keep it in your throat. Let it go! Hope this helps! ",

There are lots of online resources or books in libraries on this subject which will give you a good insight into how the voice operates. Self-Analyse Once you have some ground level knowledge, then you should work out which areas you\u2019d like to personally improve: Is it your breathing? Your tone quality? Your resonance? Your vocal range? Once you\u2019ve established what areas of your voice you\u2019d like to work on, again do as much research as you can so you don\u2019t get conflicting messages and practise a little every day until these things become a natural habit. Find a Good Teacher Once you have more of an idea what you\u2019re doing, you can then engage the services of a good teacher or coach to help you get to the next level. Sure you can get a teacher right from the start, but it\u2019s a costly way of doing things when you can find out a lot of stuff for yourself with some work. At the end of the day, if you\u2019re not prepared to put in lots of ground work of your own, then you\u2019ll never reach your full potential with your voice. It\u2019s a long journey, not an instant fix, but the most rewarding thing ever if you\u2019re prepared to work hard. Good luck with your journey! ",

I can attest that YouTube is NOT the place to go for this. Those short 5 minute clips on different techniques offer a clue but not enough guidance for a safely learned technique. My advice is poke around the local theatre and music groups for someone with an education or professional experience in this stuff. Credibility is the first step on this one. Then, take up some lessons with them. That\u2019s the best and fastest way I know of for improving. If unavailable, look for some well reviewed books. I am not much of a book person so I can\u2019t help there but maybe someone else can comment a few. Best of luck! ",

There are so many ways to improve your singing depending on what you want to accomplish. Do you want to sing in tune better, have a better tone, sing songs with more emotion, have more vocal range, sing louder/stronger, sing without tiring etc. Or all of those? But all those questions have one answer: vocal training with a teacher. Yes, even someone like myself who sells at at-home vocal course recommends personal instruction. While at-home courses do work, they are limited in the fact that to truly progress as a \u201csinger\u201d you need immediate personal feedback. Also, personal coaching can zero in on a specific problem immediately to solve a problem that has come up. Personal coaching also allows you to work on song delivery. A second set of impartial ears is the key to truly learning. Look me up at: http://www.rpmvocalstudio.com I teach people all over the planet via Skype.Kevin Richards ",

            "answer_text": "As well as finding a good coach, as mentioned by others, do vocal exercises when you can. One I find good for improving voice strength and range is this: Find one of the notes in the lower to middle part of your vocal range, which will be note 1. Go up in the scale, adding an extra note each time, i.e. 1, 1\u20132\u20131, 1\u20132\u20133\u20132\u20131, 1\u20132\u20133\u20134\u20133\u20132\u20131 etc. Once you reach 8, start again, but from a higher note. This can help to increase your vocal range upwards when repeated over time, and can strengthen your voice. If you\u2019re looking to expand your vocal range downwards, do the same, but start in the middle-high section of your range and work backwards, i.e. 8, 8\u20137\u20138, 8\u20137\u20136\u20137\u20138 etc. Like before, stop at 1, then lower the starting note. *I can attach a link to an example of this if needed.* ",

It is possible to practice and work at it enough to sing on key and work on your breath control to improve it that way, but you will have to work ten times harder than someone who is naturally gifted with a great singing voice. There are people who believe anyone can sing, they just have to learn to, but it\u2019s not always about being on key or hitting the right note, I have a kind of weak and odd tone to my voice, and honestly it\u2019s not so much I wanted to sing as I wanted to be a naturally gifted singer. I don\u2019t want it enough to work at it. People can take voice lessons, and improve, but someone who is naturally gifted with a good voice will probably sound better even after all the practice. I\u2019m not exactly sure, but it seems to me it\u2019s just not for everyone. But if you want to work at it, you can sing well enough to not sound awful. ",

Listen listen listen to how your voice, the notes you are singing, blend, equalize, harmonize with another voice.

Just being able to do that voice lessons can help. A good Coach can help you with breathing techniques, vocal techniques, and teach you how to use your diaphragm. This brings out as much richness and range as possible. Some people are just simply born with the talent. A good metaphor example.A boxing coach is the artist and to never be a great boxer but he has the vision.He knows how to train the fighter. The boxer becomes his canvas. The picture then comes clear after the event is over. The same can be said for someone who is naturally a great singer.

            "answer_text": "My initial advice: Learn vocal therapy techniques to keep your voice in good shape, especially if you are going to be imitating your favorite singers. Resonant voice placement techniques and other gentle vocal exercises can keep your voice strengthened and in good shape, even before you go to release your first note. Some lip trills, and some gentle humming are great to start with.  Push up on either side of your cheeks with your fingers, and feel your lips get looser and release tension. This will allow you to relax your larynx. Now just hum lightly while allowing the air to make your lips bubble in a b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b sound. Take this up and down in pitch once you get used to it. That\u2019s a good first step in having a healthier voice, as well as sounding better. If you have a piano, you should do some trills and try to match pitch with the piano, as that\u2019ll help your pitch. If you\u2019re gonna imitate your favorite singers, remember not to push too hard. Imitation is good to learn new stylistic techniques, but what works in a healthy way for Ariana Grande might not work amazingly for you.

Although pure vowels, low breath support and correct air flow is used in all styles, different styles take different techniques. Belting, mixing registers, use of space, use of the false vocal chords, etc. would indicate the singing method you should use. The best thing is to find a teacher well trained in the bel canto method first to get a solid foundation, and then when you decide in what direction you want to go with your voice, work with a person who knows that style. A great teacher will specialize in one style but should know many methods and how to teach many styles. ",

I\u2019m sure as I can be that you\u2019re not delusional, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with you. But your own impression of your own voice might be faulty - sometimes we don\u2019t hear the voice in the same way from \u201cinside\u201d as it sounds outside. You have to learn not just to produce the voice well, but to monitor it within the body, understand and memorise the sounds it makes, and regulate those sounds as you sing. If you\u2019re mis-hearing (this really does happen) then you need an external assessor to help you focus your hearing properly. You don\u2019t have to enter three decades of voice training. Just get a teacher for a few lessons and they will put you on the right track. ",

Your voice won't grow and develop unless you have confidence it will go somewhere. Although you know you might not be able to hit a note, go for it anyways to expand your range.Don't overdo it. There's a point where your voice is going to get tired, and when that happens you have to give it a break. You don't want to break your voice!Hope I helped!",

Practice daily for limited period of time and then go on increasing your hours. There are many apps in play store which help to get the perfect scale and tune. Practice on them. You can get karaoke apps. They prove to be really interesting. If you can't get high notes, scream them out. At first it will seem bad, for both you and people around you, but you'll get it eventually. Try and get command on your vocals. Be calm and remember \u2018practice makes man perfect\u2019 :) ",

Becoming better, for me, was a journey that took 10 years. I coached myself to sing songs or scales that I play on my cello and eventually started to sing some of my favourite songs. Start by listening. Listen to cover artists or groups such as Pentatonix. Pay attention to they melodies and understand how a song works - e.g how Pentatonix uses the baritone notes to add to songs with really high notes. Then, choose one of your favourite songs which has a relaxed change of notes - e.g Falling in Love - Kina Grannis. Keep singing, matching notes and hum tunes. Record yourself and listen. Even now, I cannot hit notes on some songs such as Gold by Kiiara. Basically, everytime you can, sing, hum and tap a beat out. It\u2019s always music. ",

And you\u2019re not an athlete, right (well, haha, maybe you are\u2026)? Same with your voice: Of course you can train, tune in, purify, expand, and free your voice, even if you\u2019re not an accomplished singer. Your voice is unique and you can sound as powerful, beautiful, and free as you feel. That\u2019s where it starts. How are you feeling? Clear out any past habits or patterns that are in the way of you either believing you can sing, or taking steps to take lessons or watch youtubes, or even just getting up and SING. I have three free videos on my site that start very simply, very holistically. It\u2019s the best place to start, because you\u2019re not just a pair of vocal folds, as some may have you believe. You\u2019re an entire micro cosmos, waiting to express itself! Enjoy! ",

Think of your strengths and weaknesses. Focus on those weaknesses more but be sure to stay sharp with your strengths. Find a balance between gradually improving those weaknesses while maintaining your strengths. Some methods that may help you sing better are pointing your chin at your chest while singing, think of an elevator for low-high notes, and practice A-E-I-O-U until it feels natural. Keep your chin planted while pointing while singing. Be sure you practice A-E-I-O-U with your mouth not opened widely. Think up for low notes with less weight, and high for high notes with more weight. ",

As other people have said already, the best way to develop your singing skills is by taking voice lessons from a good vocal coach or following a singing program to learn the basics for singing. You need to learn breath support, placement, pitch, projection, and a whole bunch of things that will make your singing easier, better, and safer. Learning all of those things takes time and effort so those are the two things you can bring to the table to improve your skills. If you want to learn on your own time, check out The Four Pillars of Singing as it teaches healthy singing technique from the ground up (it focuses on contemporary singing so it is especially useful if what you\u2019re trying to sing is contemporary and not classical music). Best of luck and whatever you do just keep singing! ",

Contrary to the other response tone deafness isn't the only problem. I know a lot of people that aren't tone deaf who can't sing. For some regardless of how much coaching and practice they get it doesn't help much. They have other issues such as a very limited range or some just have unpleasant voices. This is why more information or hearing your voice is important to truly answer your question. If you have any of these issues chances are you will never be a good singer. Most if not all really good singers have always had some natural ability to start with. Even as a child I could sing so developing my voice was fairly easy. ",

When I was on co-op during school this is exactly what I did, and I found that my teacher pointed out many things I would not have known to look for. For instance, the way you use the muscles in your face (cheeks, lower lip) and how you can think about pronouncing certain syllables can help your projection and tone. Sing songs you like, practice, have fun, and that will be beautiful. ",

I\u2019ve even recorded an album with a group. Don\u2019t be too hard on yourself. I did have voice instruction in college, but still never thought I was that good. Just a little advice; if you want to know if you have a good voice, or if your voice can be trained, pay for 1 vocal lesson at a music store, school, or studio, and get an honest assessment. If you\u2019re still in school, arrange a time after school to audition for the choir teacher. See what they think. Then go from there. ",

You want to weed out any tension; if your body is tense, your singing will be tense. I think of my body as a battery - you only have so much energy to use and what you're trying to do is be really efficient with how you spend it. For example, you've had a stressful day at work and your shoulders are tight. No point is using energy keeping your shoulders tight when that's going to impede your progress as a singer by adversely affecting your breathing. If you would like some guidance I have a free intro course http://bit.ly/FreeSingingCourse. Many thanks Jayne ",

Singing lessons, with the right teacher, can be useful in learning these techniques and bringing them into your singing sessions. One tip i can give is to place your forefinger and second finger gently onto your throat as you sing. Try to \u2018feel\u2019 the way you are vibrating and allow yourself to experience your voice internally through vibration. Although this sounds a bit \u2018woo woo\u2019 it\u2019s actually about connecting to yourself, and so your inner voice. ",

There are some muscles underneath your chin. Muscles that will kill the singing process if they are engaged! These are called the diagrastic muscles..... To feel these muscles for yourself, place your thumb underneath your chin, and press gently on the skin. Now, swallow for me. Make some noise if you like.... .....Can you feel how tight those muscles felt when you swallow? These muscles are bad news for singing, and with incorrect technique, will almost always become tight. When this happens, they will restrict your singing range, effect the quality of your tone, and most likely, become quite sore! The Secret To Star Singing This video shows how to lessen that stress. All these seemingly little things, are key to improving your voice. ",

But there are some ways to make it easier and more fun. Don\u2019t try to practice for many hours a day. You will lose focus, motivation and hate every minute of it. But instead of torturing yourself, set small goals and if you practice, practice deliberately. If you have trouble with that, maybe use a tool or a program. There is so much stuff for that on the internet. Sometimes you have to pay a lot of money, but some pages don\u2019t require sign up or a subscription. One of these platforms is Flowra on Sing songs | Flowra. It offers the original songs and cover versions of every listed song in their database. You can choose a whole song or just one single line, because it has synced lyrics to every song. The special thing about that platform is that it lets you loop your selected lines over and over again. Until it is perfect. And THAT is how you will get better. Practice deliberately. Practice regularly. And practice with fun I hope my answer was a bit of a help for you. ",

I was only able to do those because we had one that visited my school to give lessons for cheap, they are normally very expensive. But if you can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to pay for that, then the best way to improve on your own time is to work on relaxing your voice and controlling your breath. When I say relaxing your voice I mean releasing tension in the muscles of your neck, throat, shoulders, and face while you sing, and breath control refers mainly to breathing with your diaphragm. Proper breathing for singers involves breathing deeply and feeling your diaphragm inflate your chest cavity, without heaving up your shoulders the way many people do when they breathe. These things can be difficult to do for a beginner who can\u2019t always tell the difference, so one way you can help with this is by actually making different recordings of yourself singing and/or looking in the mirror while you practice and try to improve your technique. This can also help with your pitch-sense, which is most easily improved by simply practicing a lot and learning to better \u201cfeel\u201d being right on the pitch. ",

Even choirs with directors who aren\u2019t trained in vocal technique are going to provide feedback in the form of other voices, regular practice, and the opportunity to hear good singers. A skilled director will teach you everything from how to warm up your voice, to how to read music, to how to control and blend your voice with others. If you\u2019re already in a choir and want to improve, there are many options. One option is to take voice lessons. Another is to practice ear training or learn to read music by studying another instrument such as piano. Additionally, breath control is generally considered to be the foundation of singing, so learning a skill like yoga or meditation can be useful. ",

In my experience (and I have played a lot of music in my days) the main thing that makes a good singer is actually NOT how well she/he hits the tone even though that helps of course. No, the main thing to practise and become really good at when it comes to singing is actually rhytm. To hit and end the tone exactly when you should. Listen to any singer you think is ok/good and then switch to someone you think is great and I believe you will find that what separates the two are the rhytm in their singing. Unfortuneatly this is in my experience also the hardest thing to master when it comes to singing. Good luck ",

Singing from just the voice ain\u2019t gonna help you improve your singing. Hence I list down few major pointers which will work as a mantra towards better singing. Practice everyday or simply stated in terms of music- Riyaz everyday.To improve your pitch, voice modulation and better grip at your vocal chords do sargam riyaz.To make your vocal sound more prominent with accurate power, try singing from your stomach and not your vocal chords(easier said than done as it requires absolute discipline and dedication to practice and master it).Last but not the least, sing from your heart and bring out the best in you.These were simple tips as there are no easy ways to learn singing. It took me a lot of efforts to reach the level I am in as a passionate singer myself so I was able to relate to the query. And as the saying goes- Practice is the key to success. Cheerios!!! ",

Practicing lower notes will make your voice bassy. Of course, practice is the most important thing. Once you have got it, he should give some teaching og basic Raaga like yaman. After learning its notation, he will teach you Chota Khyal or the base point. I can see that you are from India. You might have heard Abhi na jao chhodkar (translation dont leave me and go) by Rafi and Asha. If you wany to sing this song, you should understand Raaga Yaman. Your voice will be good after practice. Please feel free to ask me further if you want to. Best of luck. ",

So straight forward, here are some of my wisdoms- Read books aloud. This really helps. It helps you to find the inner voice or the way your accent gives out otherwise.The most important one is, when you sing don't keep that singer's voice stuck on your head. If you do that, you'd just be imitating the lead's voice. Instead, clear your mind, and sing. Bet you have heard people saying \u201cSing from your voice\", well this is it. And when you do so, you won't be afraid to take on ANY NOTES!last one, practice. And if its possible always have a warm up of your voice before singing in front of a crowd.That's it. Youtube's advices are all just time taking. And you will never keep any point of what you saw on videos. Technical words are just there to confuse you. Second point is the best one. Try. You'd be amaze to discover how your VOICE actually sounds like. Happy Practice! ",

He helped me improve my singing voice. If you don't want to use a vocal coach or can't afford there are YouTube videos on vocal training.

If your throat starts to hurt, you're doing it wrong! Don't push it. Allow the sound to freely come out. As soon as you start closing your jaw you get problems. ",

Thereafter we should look or an experienced vocal teacher, having our teacher correct us, and continue to record ourselves, and listen to how we are singing. When trying to sing a song, we should attempt to record our voice with the original singer on one track, and duplicate to start. Thereafter we may add our own. A singing course and vocal teacher will teach breathing, lip trills, lip rolls, and how to balance air, and mouth position. All in all, the best way is to ask someone for help. We should start with what is easiest first, and expand on that. ",

Here\u2019s the logic behind \u2013 answer these questions: Do you have vocal cords?Are you able to make sound with your vocal cords? If you answered yes to the two above questions, then you can sing. Right? Well, maybe. If you are truly tone deaf, then chances are you can\u2019t sing. Amusia, the technical term for tone deafness, is a perceptual problem. Someone who is tone deaf is unable to carry a simple tune or pick out differences in pitch. But does that mean if you can\u2019t hear or match slight variations in pitch then you are tone deaf? No, certainly not! Scientists are still in disagreement where to draw the dividing line between a lack of training or even exposure to music and Amusia. So if you are able to very basically distinguish high pitches from lower ones you are probably not tone deaf. The same goes for being born deaf \u2013 if you can\u2019t hear then you probably can\u2019t sing (although there is research out there that suggests this is changing). Practice makes perfect so keep practicing to sing better and better. ",

There are other characteristics too, but those are more related to presentation. My overarching guide point is intonation.  I can help singers color up their act and work on embellishment.

Singing is an art that is studied like any other musical instrument and therefore, if I understand the meaning of your question, in seriously understood singing there is no self-study. If you still are in your late twenties, you will have to look for a good singing teacher (there are few good, most bad or very bad) or, better, to enroll in the singing course in a music conservatory. This requires years and years of study of singing, of related musical subjects (solfeggio, history of music, harmony, poetic and dramatic literature, acting, piano, etc etc). First of all you will need to have a good starting voice otherwise nothing to do.

People take music lessons all the time for an instrument - your voice is also an instrument. I think it is possible yet quite difficult to get good without lessons; generally it will go much faster with lessons - and a knowledgeable instructor will give you continuous and constant feedback; not to mention he or she will guide you in a regimented way in how to sing, how to improve, and how to rehearse. If you can\u2019t get the lessons, I recommend searching for free ones on the internet (youtube, etc.), and continue to record yourself to track your progress. Wish you the best whatever route you take! ",

Here is some of what I do to train with one of my go to warmups that helps warming up your vocal cords, engage articulation, voice placement, and breath support. First I set it with breath and place my hands on my lower stomach area and breathe into my hands making sure my chest doesn\u2019t rise up. It helps to do this laying down. Then I inhale through my nose and release on the exhale through my teeth like making an \u201cssss\u201d sound slowly and with resistance, for about up to 30 seconds on the out breath. I do at least 10 of these a day. Also, I do a glide from low to high and high to low on lip rolls and tongue trills (rolling my lips and then my tongue from a low tone to a high tone and then stretching from high to low) Here are a stack of positions (consonant and vowel stacks) you can try by singing the in a row on a low note and then repeating the words in a row going higher to the next note (do this with all the stacks): Bah, Buh, Beh, Bee, Boo, Bum Gah, Guh, Geh, Gee, Goo, Gum Nah, Nuh, Neh, Nee, New, Num Mah, Muh, Meh, Mee, Moo, Mum Zach, Zuh, Zeb, Zee, Zeb, Zum I hope my share was understandable and you were able to give it a try. After the warmups, try singing some of your favorite songs. Nyla  ",

Of course it is a matter of taste-some people may prefer the singing of Enya for example, or Pavarotti- others may prefer Taylor Swift. In general though, it is when a person sings \"in tune\" and with no strain in the voice- Janis Jopin did not have a \"beautiful\" voice, nor did Bob Dylan, but they were called singers nonetheless.

I\u2019ve heard that I might be an alto (can be soprano) I\u2019m scared to sing loudly and use power so I tend to use falsetto. The fear can sometimes be when I\u2019m talking normally as well. I love vocalists and that\u2019s all I listen to. Skilled artists and powerful songs is my jam. I just wish that I could be like one of them and I just want to know how I can get better.

Putting emotions, pronouncing correctly, learning to breathe correctly, modulating the voice, exercising your body, following a healthy routine are some vital essences you can implement after you learn to sing.

            "answer_text": "There are two kinds of voices that are ugly. And both of them have found their way into pro recordings. First there are most of today\u2019s singers. Terrible voices. Because they cannot carry a tune, sing in pitch for crap! They got picked, usually, for a \u201clooks\u201d, not their voice. And there is a TON of electronic magic going on in their recording/processing, and their live performance singing. Pitch correct has become a tool they use so people think they\u2019re singing to pitch. They are not. If you ever heard most of today\u2019s pop singers perform without pitch correct, you\u2019d be amazed at how poorly they sound! But the music producers literally spend $thousands$ to get them to sound . . . questionable good. Then there is the voice that doesn\u2019t have a pleasant sound. But the person with that voice knows how to use it properly, and gets the job done. Take Joe Cocker for example. Extremely talented musician! But his voice was gruff, harsh, and his articulation was often times almost so bad his lyrics were sometimes unrecognizable. But he was extremely talented, had a ton of emotion that he could express vocally. And as a result, he was incredibly popular, and recorded many albums, and had many hit records. The differences between the 1st example and Joe are . . . he knew what he was doing, and he was very talented! ",
