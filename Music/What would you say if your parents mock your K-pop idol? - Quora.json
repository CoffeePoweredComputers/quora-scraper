            "answer_text": "My parents don't like K-pop idols at all. When I first got into K-pop, they along with my sister would make fun of me for admiring them. I used to fight and argue a lot with them on this matter but as time passed by I've stopped bothering and this turned out to be a wonderful solution. I still do ask my parents to respect them as they're humans too and wearing makeup and hailing from East Asia wouldn't make them any different from us. My parents have started disrespecting them less now, as they know that I won't really respond to what they're saying about them. Our parents don't get bothered when we listen to other genres of music, or when we talk about other musicians but they start raging when we specifically talk about K-pop. I don't think they should do that as they're also working hard to provide entertainment like everyone else in this field. ",

It makes them all akward, like if I was saying a joke about someone dying. Or just don\u2019t say anything at all, look at them slower blinking your eyes and leave. ",
