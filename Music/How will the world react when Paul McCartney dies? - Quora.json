            "answer_text": "Hmmm.... this is a difficult one to answer. It's easy to say that the reaction to McCartney's death will be similar to the out pouring of grief surrounding the deaths of performers like Michael Jackson, Prince and Elvis but all those performers have something in common which McCartney (hopefully) does not.  They all died suddenly and unexpectedly. Sir Paul is now in his seventies and will likely live another decade or two.  Thus when he eventually does pass away it will be more than likely of natural causes and his death won't be totally unexpected. Thus I see it as being more like when Frank Sinatra passed away back in 1998.  Mourning world wide and his music will become very popular again for a time but it won't have the shock factor that the afore mentioned deaths had. But of course all this is conjecture. You see the first members of the \"rock n'roll generation\" are now reaching old age and we really haven't experienced what is it like when someone whose career really represented \"youth\" dies of old age. One thing we do know for sure. A new generation will be exposed to the magical music that he helped create as part of the greatest band in history.   ",

            "answer_text": "It depends upon how he dies. If it is after a \"brief illness\" then there will be a short period of tribute, followed by the world quickly moving on to other things. After all, we've all witnessed McCartney's lengthy slide into mediocrity and irrelevance since the late 1970s and watched the toll that it has taken upon the man and his music. The longer that he lives the less relevant he'll become as future generations become less and less enamored with the Beatles and their music. If he overdoses, is murdered or dies in an accident then, ironically, his reputation will be \"rehabilitated.\" Gone will be the Paul McCartney who croaks terribly mediocre version of new songs as well as who can now barely sing the classics which made him wealthy and world famous. The public will be treated with the life and times of the \"heroic\" Paul McCartney who helped to found the Beatles, who acted like a stabilizing \"rock\" when the group disintegrated, who then resurrected his career with Wings and who bravely overcame the death of his wife, Linda Eastman. At this point, how the world reacts depends completely upon how Paul McCartney shuffles off this mortal coil. ",
