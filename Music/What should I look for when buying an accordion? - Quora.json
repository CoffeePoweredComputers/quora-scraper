            "answer_text": "Well, it depends on a few factors. To start with, are you an accomplished accordion player of any sort? I\u2019m assuming \u201cNo\u201d to begin with for the first part. There are several types of accordions, and what is available may depend on what part of the world you live, and specifically what type of music you intend to play. (I\u2019ll ignore concertinas, because those are another issue entirely, even if very similar.) There are three major types of accordions you will tend to encounter: Piano Accordions, Button Accordions, and a \u201cBayan Accordion\u201d, a Russian chromatic button accordion. For the latter, unless you\u2019re in Russia, or some Eastern European countries, those will be harder to find, and possibly more difficult to learn. We\u2019ll deal with the first two. The Piano Accordion, is exactly what it sounds like. The treble keys, played with the right hand, look like a piano keyboard. The keys are thinner than an actual piano keyboard, however. The bass portion, in a typical PA, referred to as \u201c120 button bass.\u201d \u2026because there are 120 buttons. I wouldn\u2019t purchase much fewer than 120 buttons, though there are ones with 12, or 24 buttons. True, you might not play all of them, but once you understand the layout, you\u2019ll easily understand the bass portion. (Circle of 5ths, and most buttons have chords: Major, Minor, 7th, Diminished). The Button Accordion, of which there are several variants, tend to be used in either Irish music, or Mexican music. The Irish button accordion will be diatonic, and have a different note on push and pull. (It\u2019s as if you put a harmonica to bellows and buttons.) The Mexican Button Accordion is very similar, but the treble has a different layout. You may be able to try out this kind of button accordion at a Guitar Center. They usually won\u2019t have a full complement of bass buttons, and the playing tends to be limited to certain keys. C, D, or G, depending. For some Irish music, this isn\u2019t a problem. Whether it\u2019s a piano accordion (same note push/pull) or button accordion (different note push/pull) understand that this will affect how you learn the instrument. Depending on the music you intend to play, or how much of a musician you are, this could be either frustrating (can\u2019t do accidentals you want) or mind blowing (remembering which directions to push the bellows.) An accomplished musician should, in my opinion, look into a piano accordion, as there will be fewer limitations. Opinions may vary. \u2014\u2014- Back to what to look for? If you\u2019re set on a particular type of accordion, and you walk into a store or find one for sale, you\u2019ll want to see if it will FIT with you. Adjust the shoulder straps, see how the weight feels. If it\u2019s too heavy, it might not be for you. Then slowly pull the bellows out with the left hand, while holding down some buttons. NEVER PULL THE BELLOWS without holding down either the air button, or some notes. This will place strain on the bellows, though it can be useful to gently pull just to make sure there are no holes in the bellows. Each note has at 2 reeds per button (chord buttons excepting, of course). For piano accordions, they may have banks of buttons selected by other selection buttons above the keyboard. They\u2019ll often have a little circle with dots inside to indicate which banks are selected. These \u201cstops\u201d can dramatically change the sound of the treble side, and the more banks you have to choose from the better! Select a single bank, and from the bottom of the keyboard move up, test each note on push and pull. You want to make sure that each individual reed sounds on each note, so select each bank, and do that for each note. The bass side will be similar, different reed in and out, testing each root note, and then listening to each chord. You won\u2019t need to use a tuner, though for individual notes it can be interesting to see if it\u2019s in tune. (Start with the button on the left that has a divot or jewel, depending. That note will be \u201cC\u201d.) Beyond that if there are issues with the accordion, you can take it to an accordion tuner to have it fixed. The reeds are usually mounted in metal reed holders, affixed to small boxes inside with a beeswax/resin mixture. Tuning accordion reeds is a challenge, and a real art. NOT SOMETHING FOR THE AMATUER. For a complete tuning, it could be several hundred dollars, if not a thousand or so. If a few reeds are out of tune, maybe just a few hundred. Each reed will also have a plastic or leather \u201cvalve\u201d, so that air from the wrong direction doesn\u2019t pass through. Depending on the age of the instrument, these may need to be replaced and could be costly. Beware if purchasing a used accordion, especially if it\u2019s \u201cvintage\u201d. If you can, make sure you have a chance to hold it, and play it, before making that decision. Or take a friend who knows accordions with you. A three or more bank accordion with 120 button bass could be an expensive purchase too, so best of luck in getting one at a good price. But for an accomplished accordion player, well worth the investment! Good luck! ",
