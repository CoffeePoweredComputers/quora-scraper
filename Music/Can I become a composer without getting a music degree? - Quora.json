            "answer_text": "This question caught my eye because I too was a student at UW Seattle who had a lot of music trapped in my head. I will share my personal experience if it helps you. I graduated in 2012, so hopefully this information is still relevant. I seriously considered being a music major back then. I had a talent for composition and knew a lot of music theory growing up. My dad has a master\u2019s in music theory, my mom has a bachelor\u2019s in music education, my older brother has a master\u2019s in composition, and my cousin got her degree in viola performance. They all told me the same thing. Don\u2019t major in music. It\u2019s incredibly difficult to make it as a music major, especially in today\u2019s job market, and very few people do make it. So I decided (with no regrets by the way) to major in mathematics instead, but I still wanted to learn composition, like you, without being a music major. There are some classes in the music department at the UW that are open to non-majors (though they are intended for people that are planning to major in music, but they will let you in), and some classes (300 level and above) are strictly restricted to majors only. The orchestration classes you mentioned are restricted to majors only unfortunately. Typically only majors get to work with professors one-on-one, but you could try to befriend one and see if they will work with you. The most helpful classes I took that assisted with composition was the 200-level music theory sequence. I highly recommend it. If you don\u2019t know any music theory, if I recall there is a 100-level intro class you can take that will get you started in that direction. They have some 200-level composition classes as well, but the content of those courses is largely determined by the instructor. I was very disappointed in those when I took them. You see, I was primarily interested in composing video game soundtracks, which is tonal music, and the entire department seemed to be only interested in atonal composition. It was actually quite frustrating because the professors at the UW were all quite dismissive of anything I wrote that was tonal. I later learned that there are other departments on campus that offer classes that teach more relevant skills for video game composition, such as how to work with modern synthesizers and so forth. So I guess my advice would be that you don\u2019t need to major in music, but by not majoring in music, you will miss out on some composition skills such as orchestration. You can study those independently though. Take the 200-level music theory sequence. If you want to learn to write atonal music, you may enjoy the 200-level composition classes as well. Depending on specifically what kind of music you want to write, there may be other classes you can take as well. ",

            "answer_text": "I am a mechanical engineer and had an interest in music as a kid. At age 30 I started taking group music lessons for about one year. I then switched to private lessons with a teacher that would teach me whatever music I was interested. After about six months of private lessons I started playing around and with my teachers help wrote my first song. I played in church and soon found that after playing a song for awhile I would come up with unique instrumentals or rhythm patterns. I wrote a few more songs and recorded with a cassette. Many songs became instrumentals recorded with my teacher. I still have the same teacher going on 37 years and have been playing for 39 years. About ten years ago I joined a Christian Rock Band and one of the guitar players wrote a few songs. Pretty soon we went from learning traditional Christian Music to writing music and recorded an entire CD, titled Step Into His Sonlight. I wrote four songs and the rhythm guitar player wrote eight songs. We started a second CD and the lead guitar player also started writing songs. At first we worried we would run out of music ideas but that did not happen. Unfortunately the band broke up as people got better jobs and moved away. I still write music and maintain contact with the other guitar player writer in the band. I do not have a music degree and can barely read music. Yes I know what notes are on the Treble Clef but I do not know where all these notes are on the neck of the guitar. My natural ability to create instrumentals with the guitar really pissed off many church group leaders with music degrees who could not play an instrument very well. People with creative ability gravitate to writing with little direction. If you want to write music start with a three or four chord progression, write some words and melody. You will find some words fit in a poem but will not fit the melody and trial and error you change words, add, delete and then you have a song. Then you will start to play around with an intro instrumental, or transition instrumental into the refrain. You will find well this four/four strumming does not work with the melody so maybe you add an upbeat or add a note to a chord based on the melody. Sometimes a melody note will clash with the chord because it is one half step from a chord note, guess what you do not play that note or find away to finger that one note a half step up/down to match your melody. Last you need to have someone help you write such that you have the correct number of beats in every measure. Try it you will like it! ",

            "answer_text": "I hope that you want to compose a lot of music; not that you want people to admire you because you\u2019re a composer. You don\u2019t need formal training to compose music: you just need to know how to play an instrument, preferably keyboard. And you need to listen to a lot of music. And you need to know enough theory to be able to put your stuff on a page. Off you go. (Formal training is great, though, in that it often speeds up the learning process, allows you to make industry contacts, and exposes you to new examples of the art that you might not have considered. And you might get a credential.) Do you want to make complex, interesting music? Learn all about theory and how it applies to multiple genres. Learn the history of those genres, so you can speak intelligently about them and let them inform your work. Ah, but you want to make a living as a composer? That\u2019s different. You need to convince people to pay you for your compositions.You need to compose music that they will pay money for.They need to respect you as a composer.Important people need to respect you.You need to be able to hold an intelligent conversation about music with those people to gain credibility.You need credibility with the people who will pay you.You need to create some music that you might not like very much, but it pays the bills.The more legit the genre (e.g. classical, orchestra) the more legit the credentials required. That is, a degree. Or you could be famous and rich, like Sting or somebody.But if you just want to have a day job and compose for, say, a community orchestra or church in your spare time, no, you don\u2019t need a degree. Join the group, get to know the members, then ask them what they might need in terms of new music, and start writing it. ",

As is typical with university, it's best to start out at the bottom and work your way up. Your first conversation with the comp prof will probably consist of you explaining why you want to take the course, and showing them what you know. Like a job interview, sell yourself. If you are totally new to composition and theory, you can always start by going online to musictheory.net. They have courses ranging from absolute beginner to the more advanced things, and has a really nice format for learning. It also wouldn't hurt to get to know some of the Con kids and have them give you some tips as well. Oh, and as your actual question: you CAN become a composer without finishing your degree. Hans Zimmer did it, I've done it (just nowhere near Hans\u2019 level of awesome), you can do it. ",

Still, it counts: I created melodies that (as far as I know) did not exist before. I have no degree in music. I am learning music theory on my own, and I started doing so after I composed my first few tunes. I am hoping it will help me add chord progressions to the tunes, and allow me to compose music in different genres. So, in short: yes, you can. The music degree will definitely help, but isn\u2019t necessary. Taking available classes would help. ",

You won't get credit hours for it but that doesn't seem to be your goal anyway. You could always ask a grad student to give you private lessons. They're always hard up for cash. There are a lot of music tutorials on YouTube but most are trying to sell you something. If you're really a self starter, everything you need to know is available in books. One course I strongly suggest you take, if possible, is ear training and sight singing (solfeggio). This is where you train yourself to hear and repeat the intervals and harmony that you hear in your head. These are skills you will use for your entire musical life. Get started on the right foot and the rest will be so much more fluid and natural. ",
