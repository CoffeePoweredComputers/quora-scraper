            "answer_text": "Rainbows are visions, but only illusions, and rainbows have nothing to hide. We look up and see something magnificent. A huge splash of color and hope, it's after a period of dark, cold rain.  And yet, rainbows are not tangible -- you can't hold the rainbow, you can only behold it. Could you imagine what it must be like to see a rainbow for the first time? Do you remember? Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection, the lovers, dreamers, and me. You probably don't remember the first time you saw a rainbow, but you probably do look up when someone says \"Hey, look, there's a huge rainbow in the sky.\" Much like dreams, hope, love, and beauty, it's an intangible, but glorious vision. Its the beauty in the world that we can see. It's all the colors that are refracted from the colorless light. It's like all the sounds that are emitted from the soundless breath of a singer, a dreamer, a lover, and me. What a great topic to write songs about. There should be many more songs about rainbow, colors, dreams, illusions, visions, hope, and love.   What's on the other side is not a question. It's a statement. \"What\" is on the other side of the rainbow. Look at the other side and you will see the great \"what\" that begins our speculation. ",
