            "answer_text": "While I don\u2019t listen to either very often, I can still tell that Nicki Minaj\u2019s lyrics are leagues above Cardi B\u2019s. To back this up, let\u2019s have a look at some of the lyrics from \u201cMotorsport\u201d, a song they both feature on with the Migos. I\u2019m not a fan of either, so I\u2019ll keep this unbiased. And I know some people have mentioned ghostwriters, but with nothing officially confirmed, I\u2019m writing this answer under the assumption these are their own verses. Here are the opening lines to Cardi\u2019s verse:  Pretty self explanatory lyrics, not much to them. The rhymes are pretty simplistic as well, but still work. There\u2019s not too much to dissect about these bars. Now, let\u2019s take a look at Nicki\u2019s.  At a glance, these lyrics definitely look like they have a bit more substance to them. If you give them a read, you may be able to catch the bits of wordplay. The rhyming isn\u2019t the most impressive (Rhyming \u201cmouth\u201d with \u201cmouth\u201d) but overall, this verse is already more interesting than Cardi\u2019s.  These are Cardi\u2019s next lyrics. In here, she\u2019s discussing her relationship with Offset, one of the members of the Migos. As you can see, these lyrics convey her message quite bluntly. I mean, one line ends with \u201cset off\u201d and the other ends with \u201cOffset on\u201d\u2026 that\u2019s about the most interesting thing here. Again, not much to dissect.  Compared to the bars from Cardi, these lines are definitely more intriguing. The \u201csmoke with me/laced blunt\u201d line was nice. Again, there\u2019s not too much to the rhymes, but then again Cardi B doesn\u2019t have that much to her\u2019s either.  Here\u2019s Cardi B\u2019s next contribution. To be honest, the \u201cSame lips\u201d lines were the most interesting thing in this verse so far. She hasn\u2019t really said anything too incredible that would make me want to come back for another listen.  On the other hand, here there are definitely a few things to dissect. Boosie has a signature fade but people also \u201ccatching a fade\u201d by challenging Nicki. The rapper Lil Uzi Vert has a line about all his friends being dead, but an Uzi is also referring to a type of gun. Ricky and Lucy are characters from \u201cI Love Lucy\u201d. The last line is pretty self explanatory, but everything else are nice little double entendres.  Some more of Cardi\u2019s verse here. Again, not too much here. Everything\u2019s self-explanatory and doesn\u2019t offer too much substance. The \u201cCatfishing\u201d line is the closest we get to a real dissectible and it\u2019s not that complicated.  From Nicki Minaj\u2019s verse, we have something a bit more interesting. I won\u2019t waste too much time dissecting this, but the \u201cOffice worker\u201d bar is really nice and the \u201cLoose leaf\u201d line is good as well. Nothing much is said on the rest of this section, but it\u2019s still beating out Cardi.  Wrapping up Cardi B\u2019s verse, we have these bars. For people who don\u2019t speak Spanish, the last line is \u201cGive me more gasoline\u201d, as far Google translate knows. There\u2019s not too much to say here. This verse as a whole was kinda simplistic. Let\u2019s go ahead and move on to Nicki\u2019s conclusion.  I\u2019m not going too much time on these bars, but there is some nice wordplay, double entendres and the like. Once again, not much to say about the rhymes, but all in all, this is a pretty solid finish. So, overall, I think Nicki Minaj definitely outperformed Cardi B here. If you look at both verses as a whole, neither really say anything. They don\u2019t have too much of a focus here. Nicki just said nothing in a more interesting way. I don\u2019t think either of them are top tier lyricists by any means, but if we\u2019re comparing them, Nicki Minaj for sure. Again, I\u2019m not a fan of either of them. I\u2019m judging purely off of what I\u2019ve heard and my dissection of this song. Remember this is all opinion as well, you\u2019re free to like whoever you want, regardless of their lyrical talent. ",

            "answer_text": "This seems so very obvious to me to be honest I almost feel silly for answering but not trying to make you feel bad or anything like that there is no such thing as a bad question. My answer: Nikki Minaj %100. I don't particularly enjoy cardi B as an artist\u2026.or a stripper\u2026..I think she's a fake nikki knock off and that fact I jus said this publicity will pry have dire consequences becuz A DJ should not say such things about a artist who is currently killing it but nikki and cardi are in two diff classes. Cardi should not be mentioned in the same way nikki is im pretty sure cardi is Nikki's son\u2026.I mean step son. Nikki nikki nikki more talent in her mfing left thumb and or right butt cheek. ",
