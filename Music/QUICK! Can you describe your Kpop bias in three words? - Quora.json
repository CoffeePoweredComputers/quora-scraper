            "answer_text": "QUICK! Can you describe your Kpop bias in three words? Hello Hello! I am once again back with another answer, I apologize for not posting anything in a while. Even though I am writing this answer now, I\u2019m still not back fully from my short break due to work! Although, I will try my best to still post answers every now and then. Now, back to the question! If you know me, you probably know who my ultimate KPOP bias is. If you don\u2019t though, I\u2019ll just tell you that it\u2019s the girl in my profile picture- Eunha from GFRIEND. The most precious human being ever to exist! If I were to describe her in 3 words, that would probably be.   ADORABLE \u2014 Okay, if Eunha was your ultimate bias and you didn\u2019t put adorable as one of the words that describes her the best. I would have actually thrown hands at you. I mean seriously, look at this girl! She literally has adorable written all over her, how can you not call her adorable? Do you really have the guts to say no to this face? LOVING \u2014 Don\u2019t get me wrong! All the GFRIEND members are loving, but I particularly find Eunha that most affectionate out of all of them. This girl even cried on stage because she felt bad for BUDDY\u2019s who got told last minute that the fan sign won\u2019t continue due to COVID. Whenever she sees little children coming to their fan sign events, she pulls off that precious look in her eyes that seems almost like a proud mother looking into their child. She even cried for a child who\u2019s father cared more about his car than his son, when his son got into a bicycle accident. Do you know why she cried for the son that she didn\u2019t even know personally? It\u2019s because she knows what it feels like to be given so many medications. Eunha at just 7 years old, suffered from a rare type of cancer (Langerhans). She had to get a whole load of vaccines and medication, and so did the child. Loving really is one of the best words to describe her. TALENTED \u2014 Eunha is very versatile. Starting with being the lead vocalist of GFRIEND to being a master at archery, she can do basically anything. Even though Eunha isn\u2019t the main vocalist, she\u2019s the member who currently has the most collaborations and OST\u2019s out of her group. Eunha can pull off any concept, I mean if you ask her to do a sexy more mature concept. She can do it in 2 seconds flat. If you ask her to do a cute concept, she\u2019ll be ready as soon as someone tells her. That\u2019s one of the main reasons why she got the lead vocalist role, because she deserves it. Unfortunately, even though she\u2019s great with singing, dancing and archery. She\u2019s not as good with running. Those little legs of hers can\u2019t take her that far but that\u2019s okay! Since, having fun is all that matters whether you win or lose! your typical eunha enthusiast, \u2014 sammie <3 ",

            "answer_text": "My ultimate bias is rm of bts   He is so many things that I both respect and adore but three words, ima try lol WISE- he is a person who even though he is reserved, he really knows how to talk to ppl. He is extremely mature and can handle a situation so great ,even if he is winging it all, and is in distress,namjoon handles things very well and under control. He can give incredible advice and seems like if u tell him something, he wont lecture u,but would still be honest, blunt of he has to be and yet understanding and very passive. If I could choose another word for him, I would choose passive. He loves to learn and is honestly just a someone I can imagine will give u nothing but comfortable or peaceful vibes if u were sit down with him. All the members seem to help him alot but also look up to him even the older members. He is very wise.   2. HUMBLE- this man is so humble its incredible. All of bts are humble tbh. He likes to spend his money and buy high brands or collections, but this man is the type to appreciate anything. He will lower himself to help others. He would disregard his own talents or victories and would rather focus on complimenting or building up someone else's efforts.     3) HUMAN- namjoon is someone I genuinely look up to in a level that isnt a fan looking up to their idol but rather me,just a regular person, feeling motivated, inspired yet never intimidated by another person,Namjoon. He is so relatable,so easy to understand. He doesnt make me feel uncomfortable, he can be dorky, he gets shy ,he cringes at himself,he breaks things, he makes mistakes. He also makes millions, has endorsements, is a genius, multitalented and handsome, and leads the current most successful musical group. He can seem so far away but I genuinely can relate to him and take bits of what I know from him and use it to understand myself and life as much as i can. By \u2018bits\" I mean his advice. He never builds himself to be this untouchable celebrity, but just a regular guy who happens to be living life how he wants to and that's what I love. He is human and while he can be complex, he isnt unrealistic.           Rm is a great leader and so respectable to me. I cant see him as a god or anything intimidating, rm showed himself to be incredible yet very down to earth and chill. And I respect that. Hope u all enjoyed this as much as I enjoyed writing this about him\ud83d\ude0a ",
