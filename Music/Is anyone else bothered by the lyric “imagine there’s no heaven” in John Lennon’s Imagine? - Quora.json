            "answer_text": "Seems like a deliberately provactive question, but what the hey, I got some time. \u201cImagine there\u2019s no heaven\u2026\u201d is a sliver of the total of the song, and is easily offensive when taken out of context, as this question does. When John says, \u201cImagine there\u2019s no heaven\u2026No hell below us\u2026.Imagine all the people living for today.\u201d - he\u2019s simply, or maybe not so simply, saying imagine no afterlife, neither heaven nor hell, as a barometer of your behaviour. Rather, live in the now, let your morality be decided from within, not determined by some outside source. Let your heaven and hell be here now- don\u2019t live for tomorrow, a day that never comes, live for today, which is now. \u201cImagine there\u2019s no countries\u2026Nothing to kill or die for. And no religion too. Imagine all the people living life in peace.\u201d Mostly I\u2019ve noticed that when Westerners hear the word \u201creligion\u201d, there\u2019s a tendency to assume \u201cChristianity\u201d, and very few things are as offensive to Westerners as that anyone would dare question Christianity\u2019s dogmatic foundations and the validity and veracity of its various claims to power and \u201csuperiority\u201d above all other human spiritual narratives and practices. While John, in this verse, is referring to this particular Western quagmire, he\u2019s also referring to world religions in general, and those things that we are told we must be \u201creligious\u201d about, countries, flags, armies, police force, sports teams, gangs \u2014 anywhere that our allegience, our loyalty is required, regardless of our own personal assessment of the situation may be, by force and intimidation if necessary. John is saying imagine no sides, imagine no lines, imagine no borders, imagine no divide. Imagine all the people being different without fighting about it, difference without conflict, living in peace. \u201cImagine no possessions\u2026no need for greed or hunger. Imagine all the people sharing all the world. This verse is often cast as some kind of \u201ccommunist manifesto\u201d, \u201cGodless communism\u201d being a scourge second only to Nazis to Westerners, and especially in the US narrative, where having Nazi tendencies seems to be becoming more and more acceptable and respectable. He\u2019s actually saying imagine disabusing ourselves of the notion that ownership, and the obssession some display with ownership, in its many manifestations, is not that most fundamental basis of our interaction with one another. There is more than enough, an abundance, for all the people to share. What of a system, call it what you will, that emphasizes abundance, and allows us to share that abundance with one and all? \u201cYou may say I\u2019m a dreamer, but I\u2019m not the only one. I hope someday you will join us, and the world will be as one.\u201d You may scoff at John and his naivete, but rest assured he is not alone in imagining such an Earth, and Universe, into existence. So whatever you may think, and however you may insult, we look forward to the day when you\u2019ll join our efforts and existence to be good and better in the world now, and we can share our abundance and differences and beauty with each other in love and harmony. Far-fetched to some for sure, but there are also some of us who hold these dreams close to our hearts and live them everyday the best that we can. And we are making progress, getting closer and closer\u2026. \u201cDifference does not require conflict. Harmony requires difference. I rejoice in our differences! LOVE ALL the people.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "I think it is very important to consider the line in the context of the (full) lyrics and understand the intent behind the overall message put forward in the song. I always felt there were two sides to John. He was a bit of a scallywag, a radical, somebody who seemed to enjoy the shock value his comments would have on some people. Then there was the serious side. He appeared to be a deep thinker, somebody who was not afraid to question traditional values, morals and beliefs, and I think he had an analytical and explorative mind. John was a young man during the 60s when the Vietnam War took place, young people were being victimized for promoting peace, racial tension and violence was at serious levels and the world was on edge because of the cold war happening between the US and Soviet Union. This very obviously had an impact on John who thought deeply about the reasons why the world was as it was and what the solutions might be. His subsequent views on love and peace are well documented. For me Imagine was intended to promote \u2018thought\u2019. For example, \u201cImagine there\u2019s no heaven\u201d. I suspect the average Christian would initially respond to that by feeling in ways ranging from ill at ease to panic. But if we could settle ourselves down and objectively consider if the world would be better or worse, some important insights may emerge. As an example, if there were no heaven or afterlife, would so many suicide bombers be killing people around the world? Would people willingly sacrifice their life in the name of their religion if there was no heaven or paradise to ascend to afterwards? I am very confident that John asked such questions. He also asked, what if there were no countries, religion or possessions, that instead we were all one brotherhood of man. Would that improve the world? Yep, imagining there is no heaven is unnerving and even scary. But mankind is scary too. We are the products of our belief systems and John knew that. I think he recognized that our future and destiny requires us to care more about each other and work out how to do that. Peace alone is not the answer. He tried to help us see that the world\u2019s problems are complex and some of the reasons why are suggested in the song. As I stated, Imagine was intended to promote \u2018thought\u2019. I believe John really cared and he wanted us to care too. It\u2019s bothering - yes, but why! ",
