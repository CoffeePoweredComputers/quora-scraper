            "answer_text": "Lets start with Unblack Metal For Christians, it is our job to spread God\u2019s word, using any means necessary. If I remember correctly, it was Antestor who started the Christian Unblack Genre as a means to combat the Anti-Christ ways of the real Black Metal bands, like Mayhem or Gorgoroth. Anyways, Unblack Metal is very interesting and a really good way to reach out to a group of people who like Black Metal and can not find any Christian groups that share their taste in music. Here are some good Christian Unblack Metal bands- AntestorCrimson MoonlightSlechtvalkHordeNow for Christian/White Metal White Metal, or Christian Metal as it is more commonly known, is the most common and most widespread form of \u201cJesus Metal\u201d. Most White Metal bands come from the Americas, usually more kid/teen friendly than Unblack Metal. You\u2019ll also find that White Metal also has a more singable tune since the aimed target group will probably be young teens who have that burning urge to sing. Here are some of the most notable White Metal Bands- SkilletRedDemon HunterThousand Foot KrutchIf you listened to each song from the Unblack and then White list, then you will know the sound difference. The Unblack Metal generally has a more guttural and screaming sound than the White Metal. But remember, metal is metal, no matter what the genre or spirituality is. ",

            "answer_text": "From my understanding, unblack and white are the same... a 'genre' with Christian themes and black metal styled riffing. The 'goal' of white/unblack is to be the opposite of black metal while still sounding the same ; turning the devil's music against him, or some such silliness. Christan metal can encompass any metal genre or subgenre that has Christian themes whether its \"white/unblack\" or Christian grindcore. ",
