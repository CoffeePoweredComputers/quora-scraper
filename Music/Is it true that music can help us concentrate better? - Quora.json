            "answer_text": "Apparently, none of the people prior to me have been reading the question, carefully. As proof, I will answer this question with some Mozart playing softly. There now what was the question? Ah, yes. That's right. Is it really possible to stay focus on your studies, with music playing in the background? Well, let me first say, that it depends. The music you play is the factor, in this instance. Let me explain. If, for example, you play some AC/DC, and try to do your homework, instead of doing what you were trying to do, homework in this case, you will be singing along to either Brian Johnson, or Bon Scott. Or trying to figure out which of the two it is to whom you are listening. On the opposite hand is your are listening to, say, Rockmanonoff, and are doing calculus, you are statistically more likely to understand and grasp the concept. The key is the frequency. Classical music of a specific age, makes for great listening for the simple fact that your body responds to it once manner consistent to the frequency outpit of the music played. AC/DC, while indeed a great band to listen to, when at a party, is not a great idea, while attempting to grasp the concept of, say, relativity. Einstein played violin, as he let his mind wonder. Now, while it's had been fairly recently disproven, it was a brilliant theory, nonetheless. It even was said that Ben Franklin played his violin while trying to write the initial stage of the Declaration of Independence. ",

            "answer_text": "My concentration is absolutely destroyed by music. I remember getting fired from a cleaning job because I had just bought a new album and the songs were bouncing around inside my head. It slowed me down so much and made me constantly aware of how much I hated my job. If I have music on in the background while I am reading I will often notice that I have just been turning pages for the last couple of minutes without actually taking any of the words in. I notice a massive difference when playing snooker too: in perfect silence I can quite happily knock in 50 breaks - put some music on and I'm back to potting a red and a colour then missing (if I'm lucky). It's the same for other \"think-y\" things like chess. It affects my ability to catch a ball as it takes me out of the moment and influences the timing of my actions too. I'm quite good at blocking out visuals (I tend to listen to TV programmes rather than watching them) but I can't ignore things I hear no matter how much I want to. I think that's why people turn the music down to park their car. I remember my teachers at school telling me that they'd heard listening to Mozart and Bach made it easier to do your homework. That was only true of my music homework. At all other times the best environment for me to concentrate in is absolute silence. I always suspected they'd never really spent much time considering what concentration actually is. [maybe they always put music on in the background when they worked through those kind of thoughts and that limited the depth of their thinking?] Music can be good for relaxation and focus/meditation. It's great for running to and exercising. It's great for happy times and sad times. Music can be motivating and inspirational. There are so many great uses for music. For anything that requires concentration, music is like that guy who shouts random numbers into your ear while you're trying to count: really not helpful. ",
