            "answer_text": "So many good answers here already. But I think a lot of this depends on what you mean by \"make you think.\" While so many rap and hip hop artists out there have lyrics (and music) that is interesting, I have yet to find an album that is as challenging as Dead Prez's debut, Let's Get Free. On it, Dead Prez aggressively--at times militantly--critiques American culture as a whole. From the self-critical take down of the hip-hop industry (\"Hip-Hop\" the only track remotely radio-friendly), to the scathing indictment of the institutions of education (\"They Schools\"), to the challenges to dominant sexual culture (\"Mind Sex\", the only gettin-it-on song to feature chess), to advocating vegetarianism (\"Be Healthy\"), to true identity (\"I'm A African\"), to championing violent revolution (\"Police State\"). Their analysis is damning, their viewpoint is uncompromising, and their solutions are deeply unsettling. To call the album a manifesto might be underselling it. At times embarrasingly naive, relentlessly existential, and always, always challenging to everything you believe, I always turn to Dead Prez when I want to be shaken out of my confidence that I know the right answers and am living the right way. Even when I wind up back where I started, I feel wiser for having been so challenged. When you listen to this album you cannot just groove to the beats, you must accept or reject, and so you always think. ",

            "answer_text": "One man can change the world by Big Sean is one rap song that actually makes me contemplate what we humans are actually doing. The song relays ideas of the hard times the black community in the US were having. The meaning of the lyrics and phrases in the song are really deep and will definitely make you doubt yourself. I'm sure if you listen to it you'll be asking yourself what you can do to change the world. ",
