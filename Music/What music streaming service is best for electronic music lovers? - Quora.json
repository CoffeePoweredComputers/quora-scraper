            "answer_text": "SoundCloud (okay if you want to listen to something popular, otherwise, it\u2019s very difficult to navigate), Mixcloud (mixes from any kind of DJs, typically also popular music), PromoDJ (DJ mixes and independent artists, you can find something new, but pretty hard to navigate), Tuneself (independent artists, unlikely you find there something popular, but lots of good undiscovered music), Digitally Imported (ton of channels, just pick the genre you like - popular (mostly) and less popular music). There are some not bad channels on SomaFM (independent artists mainly, I think). A lot depends on what kind of electronic music you listen to specifically. It\u2019s pretty diverse music - from noise and ambient through electro house and psychedelic trance to hardcore gabba\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Spotify! I\u2019ve been surprised over and over again by the width and depth of Spotify\u2019s catalog of music. From old favorite house tracks from the 90s to small label new releases, many of them find their way onto Spotify. Once you\u2019ve built up a bit of a profile for the app to learn your preferences, by liking tracks and following artists, Spotify\u2019s music recommendation algorithms get really good at their job, and build fantastic playlists for you. Opening up my \u201cDiscovery Weekly\u201d playlist, which is refreshed every Monday, is always a treat. Not to mention the \u201cRelease Radar\u201d playlist with exclusively new releases, and the various daily mixes that suit various moods and genres. As for live mixes, SoundCloud is still my go-to. And Digitally Imported should get a mention, because they are the OG of electronic music streaming. ",
