The word \"Parties\" throws up a lot of images we all have, of the ones we attended, grew up having, etc. This is NOT anything to do with those. Celebrity Parties in the 60's varied very much, in London, with musicians we know as household names. At these Parties, George Harrison once went to, because he knew his wife, Pattie Boyd and Eric Clapton was there. When George was leaving, he asked her in the garden, where the three was, George said: \"are you leaving with him, or me\"? \"You of course\", said Pattie Boyd. You can see, much of musical history is here. She, Pattie Boyd inspired \"Something\" by George Harrison, and \"Layla\", by Eric Clapton. At one of these Parties was Justin Haywood, of the Moody Blues, and Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull. Ian Anderson decided to take up the flute, because he said, at these Parties, he realised he couldn't ever play as well as the guitarists, he saw at these Parties. Including Dylan, Donavan, and friends. In one corner George was with a guitar, as was Justin Haywood, Justin knew a Beatle Song, George didn't, he only knew his part of the song. Lots of Fans think the finished product, is those Artists, far from it. Imagine Justin Haywood teaching George Harrison, a Beatle song! When I met Jem Finer at a Heineken Festival in Nottingham, he showed me a newly restore Banjo, the neck had been restored at \u00a31,000, and a drunk Irishman was adjusting the Truss Rod, Jem took it off him, and said: \"I'll do that\". I asked him if he could play it, he said ONLY the parts he plays for the Pogues. In other words, he's not really a Banjo Player. This is the way musicians work, they only do that, that they do. I believe Justin Haywood, and The Moody Blues, was started at one of these Parties, and John Lennon would be at some, and know many more musicians, than we think they knew, and know how they started at Parties. Hendrix would drop in, any of the Stones, any of the Beatles. If a bomb went off at one of these Parties, the whole of 60's music would have been stopped dead. That's why the 60's was so special, there was cross fertilisation. Many, Many, years later, Ian Anderson asked Justin Haywood, \"why didn't you ask me to play in your Band, when you got a Flutist in\"? Justin Haywood replied: \"I didn't think you'd be interested, why didn't you say\"? You see, now would you have made that connection? ",

I'm sure he had heard their music but generally in less that group was exceptional in some way I doubt he carried less about them. He may have thought their music was okay but that's about it. Having lived back then I know I wasn't all that interested in them. ",
