            "answer_text": "It\u2019s gotta be the intro to the very first song, the mind-blowing start to RUNNING WITH THE DEVIL. The song was always a gem, but the famous intro was a crazy creation that had input from producer Ted Templeman, KISS star Gene Simmons as well as the band. Check out the original version WITHOUT the legendary intro.  Good, but not the punch to the gut intro the first song on a debut album deserves. So they experimented with an unusual sound to punch it up. The legendary noise at the beginning of the finished, masterpiece version is a collection of car horns. The horns were taken from the band\u2019s own cars, including Alex\u2019s Opel, Eddie\u2019s Volvo, a Mercedes Benz and a Volkswagen. The horns were mounted in a box and powered by two car batteries, with a foot switch to turn them on and off. The same idea was first used during the band\u2019s club sets and appeared on the Gene Simmons Demo on House of Pain, sounding after each verse. On the demo the horns also acted as a segue to Runnin\u2019 with the Devil. When they got into the studio with master producer Ted Templeman, he reworked those horned to create a sound like an alien spaceship landing on Earth, much in the way the band was about to unleash a sound alien to rock before 1978. Listen to the incredible power of this insane sound, and how it screamed look at me as the greatest debut album in history launched into the 1st track of the record.  After the crazy horns run, they stop\u2026and the song goes stark to the killer, ominous bass of Michael Anthony, followed by the pounding drums of Alex, then the incendiary guitar of Eddie, and finally the banshee wail of Diamond Dave. Each of the payers gets a quick moment to shine as it all explodes into the track. SO INCREDIBLE!!! ",
