But for a time his Aunt Mimi, whom he lived with, felt it was better for John to be more distant from his mother and they had little contact for some years. Upon reestablishing contact he was a regular around their house, but not as close as your average sibling. With the premature passing of their mother (Julia Lennon dies) when they were still kids there would have been less reason for them to bond, but his sisters would see him often and babysit John\u2019s son. John moved away from Liverpool as he became successful, using some of his money to buy them a house but seeing them less . John then moved to America for the last ten years of his life. They never saw him again but retained a relationship over the phone. It is unlikely he had any relationship with his brothers as they were born to his distant father when he was already an adult. To make things worse he fell out with his father (John Lennon sees his father Alf for the final time) and moved to a different country when the boys would have been very young. Alf died only a few years later and John was murdered a few years after that, never returning to his home. Since his sisters and 17 year old son, born before his brothers, remembers very little contact with him over these years, it is reasonable to assume that John had barely any contact with his brothers if any. Here is a very detailed interview with his sister Julia. She may not have had the closest of relationships with her brother but more than the their siblings and a very personal take on John.  ",

            "answer_text": "John didn\u2019t have any full blood siblings but had three half sisters from his mother Julia - Victoria, who was the result of an affair Julia had with a young soldier while John\u2019s father Alfred was away working as a merchant seaman during WW II. She was given up for adoption, even though Alfred returned and was willing to raise her as his own. She was renamed Ingrid and adopted by a Norweigan couple. Later, after Alfred again disappeared for a while, Julia took up with a man named Bobby Dykins, with whom she had two more daughters, Julia and Jackie. Even though Julia and Bobby never married, John had a close relationship with his little sisters, who were tweens when Beatlemania hit. Sadly John never got to meet his other sister Victoria/Ingrid before he died but years later Julia and Jackie were finally able to find and be reunited with their sister. John also had two much younger half brothers, David and Robert Lennon, from his dad Alfred\u2019s subsequent marriage to a younger woman named Pauline. John never met or had a relationship with his brothers, who were younger than their nephew Julian. John was basically a stranger to them so neither man has ever spoken about him or done interviews about him as far as I know. ",
