            "answer_text": "I only really listened to J-pop when I was much younger so I probably don\u2019t have the best judgement on up to date J-pop music but from when I did listen, comparing that to K-pop of that time (around 2009ish) and the K-pop of today, it\u2019s safe to say that they are totally different. The countries may be next to eachother however they exert such difference in their music and the morals behind their music (meaning the way Japanese and Koreans view their idols and what they see an idol\u2019s purpose as) I can\u2019t say which one is better or worse because that\u2019s too subjective but I can do my best to compare them. K-pop is definitely a lot more mainstream in the ears of a Westerner. J-pop don\u2019t take as much of a musical influence from Western music in comparison to K-pop, which gives J-pop a much more distinct sound. What I mean is, even if they both sang in English, a Westerner would be able to guess which one was a Japanese composition. J-pop still focuses their idols on being \u2018kawaii\u2019 or cute with a touch of sexiness, not changing this image or taking any inspirations from Western pop whereas K-pop have much more Western-influenced concepts in most concepts, not all though depending on the company and their vision, for example, BTS\u2019s CEO Hitman Bang explains he got a lot of his visions for music videos and concept storylines from animes and books, which is more of a Japanese-Korean concept in comparison to the normal Western-Korean concepts. In conclusion, depending on whether you like that distinct sound of the J-pop genre or a more Western influenced sound from K-pop (with exceptions) will depend on which one you prefer. ",

            "answer_text": "As a person who grew up around j-pop but moved to kpop afterwards, I\u2019m gonna say kpop here are the main reasons why, at least for the songs that I\u2019ve heard, Kpop has more English words than Jpop which is an advantage attracting more people, not only Koreans, the choreography is more complicated and \u2018different\u2019, a lot of the Jpop songs don\u2019t have a choreography, I think it\u2019s a tie when it comes to vocals, Music videos are more good than Jpop songs mv, Kpop music is a lot trendier, most of the popular Jpop artists I see are usually perform songs from an anime, solo artists in Jpop and kpop are less famous but merely Jpop, IU is pretty famous, Sunmi, Chungha, Rain who\u2019s also one of the most popular male artist/actor in Asia, Dean, Crush etc. Also, J-pop never pushed itself towards the Western industry (other than anime) as much as kpop died, they barely even tried to. Also, both of them have really influenced the modern-day culture (mostly fashion & trends). Also both are very similar when you look at it. And There\u2019s also a different topic that discusses why kpop fans are different from Jpop fans and why the Music videos are better than Jpop music video. ",

Super\u2605Dragon is a pop/rock group so their music is somewhat rougher than most kpop groups, as for Taemin's songs they're good. At the end I have to say k-pop, because I haven't listened to j-pop as much, it's mainly rock. ",
