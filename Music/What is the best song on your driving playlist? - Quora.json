            "answer_text": "\u2018The Tourist\u2019 the last track on Ok Computer by Radiohead. I\u2019m not a fan of driving. For someone who easily gets distracted by the things around him, something that demands your fixed attention for an extended period of time is bound to be troublesome. Contributing to this problem is the fact I live in the 4th largest city in the U.S, a city where it is absolutely essential to know how to drive. Now, if you\u2019re like me, you probably know that the likelihood you come across a reckless driver is quite high. You\u2019ve come to learn how to tolerate them, since that\u2019s really the only thing you can do. Yet sometimes, for inexplicable reasons, there are moments where your temper gets the best of you. You start asking yourself how in the hell some people can drive the way they do and be ok with it. Here in comes the song. In it, Thom Yorke sings about how its best to just take things slow. This point is emphasized by his wailing of \u201cHey Man! Slow Down!\u2019\u201d in the chorus, followed by the more condemnatory \u201cIdiot Slow Down!\u201d to close it out. When I witness someone doing something ridiculous on the road, I make an effort to repeat that line from the song. It gives me a satisfying sense of resolution, which helps keep my temper under control. ",
