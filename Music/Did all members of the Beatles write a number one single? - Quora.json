            "answer_text": "WOW, so much misinformation here, how about some facts (this is for their career not just during their time with the Beatles): After The Beatles broke up in 1970, each band member began successful solo careers. George Harrison would be the first to score a No. 1 hit (\u201cMy Sweet Lord\u201d) in 1970. Next up would be Paul McCartney with \u201cUncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\u201d in 1971. However, Ringo beat the great John Lennon to the punch. In 1973, Ringo hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 with \u201cPhotograph,\u201d a tune he wrote with Harrison and recorded with his solo band. Just two months later (January of \u201974), Ringo made it back to the top of the charts with his rendition of \u201cYou\u2019re 16.\u201d Lennon didn\u2019t make it there until November of that year, when \u201cWhatever Gets You Through the Night\u201d hit No. 1. Ringo nearly made it to No. 1 with The Beatles with \u201cYellow Submarine\u201d reached #2 but, as the saying goes, sometimes you need to do it yourself to make sure it\u2019s done right. Now if you limit it to JUST their time as Beatles then I am sure all their #1 hits were by Lennon/McCartney except George Harrison managed to just barely get one in with \u201cSomething\u201d which made #1 off their last album recorded \u201cAbbey Road\u201d (yes I know \u201cLet It Be\u201d came after that but was actually recorded BEFORE \u201cAbby Road\u201d but was released late to coincide with the release of the film by the same name) ",
