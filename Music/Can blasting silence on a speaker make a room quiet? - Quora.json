            "answer_text": "In spite of the Simon and Garfunkel song, there is no such thing as the sound of silence. Zero sound energy is zero sound energy. You could multiply silence by multiples of a million, but a million times zero still equals zero. That said, if you have a microphone and specialized software, you can essentially invert the phase of a waveform and as long as it's the same amplitude, this will essentially cancel out the previous noise. This is, in a dramatically over simplified way of describing it, how noise cancelling headphones work. They work best with repetitive, steady sounds in the same frequency and amplitude, such as traffic or jet engine noise. They don't work as well with occasional sounds like people talking or somebody banging on something with a hammer. ",

            "answer_text": "Everything has a polar opposite. In my theories - yes you can. Hot has cold - light has dark (hey make a darklight) - also - sound travels though pressure in the air. If you have 2 identical sound pressures meet each other (sound) then they cancel other out. In the orient they made a sound mimicker acoustic treatment. Where a sound hits a membrane and in turn pushes a ball on a string and it returns hitting the membrane at the same frequency of the sound. It is not total sound cancellation but it is a good dampener. ",

            "answer_text": "Sound is vibration in the air at an audible frequency or frequencies. Silence means no audible vibrations or no sound. Since sound is a vibration there is no way to blast silence. The phrase \u201dblasting silence\u201d is meaningless. You can make a small area silent by inverting the ambient sound and sending it out at the same level. That's how noise-canceling headsets work. That's not the same as \u201dblasting silence\u201d. ",
