I can understand how pleasant it used to be for a new learner to make a program run with no error as I started learning c++ just a year before. But you can make it more good by displaying these 2 numbers as- cout<<\u201d\\nTwo numbers you entered are- \u201c<<a<<\u201d and \u201c<<b; Then perform sum operation. Then display sum as- cout<<\u201d\\nSum of \u201c<<a<<\u201d and \u201d<<b<<\u201d is \u201c<<c; Corrections are heartily welcomed. Thank you. ",
