            "answer_text": "Different types of music have a profound effect on tension, mood, and mental state. There have been studies conducted by various universities to try and construct a psychological profile before and after listening to particular types and styles of music. With Heavy Metal/Grunge music, there was a significant increases in hostility, sadness, tension, and fatigue, and significant reductions were evident in caring, relaxation, mental clarity.   In contrast, after listening to the earthly/natural sounds, there was a significant increases in caring, relaxation, mental clarity, and vigor and a significant decreases in hostility, fatigue, sadness, and tension.   The interesting thing was the mixed results for modern and classical music. Feeling shifts among subjects were observed with all types of music. Basically from what I could understand, possibly there wasn\u2019t enough data or a control group of some kind. And yes you can have a control group for this type of research.  Earthy/Natural sounds were the most effective in increasing positive feelings and decreasing negative feelings. There was also some minor trending with modern music which could suggest it could be useful in the treatment of tension, mental distraction, and negative moods.  The overall interesting fact was, that in all the different material I have read and the results from the research was that\u2026..in about 93% of all cases\u2026\u2026the subjects felt better whenever they heard music and sound\u2026\u2026regardless of the type of music\u2026\u2026so when your feeling down\u2026..listen to music!!

            "answer_text": "Listening to music is a primary tool in therapy for almost everything. Because listening to music brings together several parts of your brain it can be used to improve calming down and focusing a person or more thoroughly distributing information in their brain. Although it seems unlikely that the phenomenon is isolated with respect to children and classical music there is an abundance of information available that indicates that how well a child integrates tasks mentally is improved by listening to classical music. Classical music and intelligence are not the only two things that matter though, and there is a lot more music out there doing a lot of good in a lot of ways, so I try to enjoy as much of many genres as possible.
