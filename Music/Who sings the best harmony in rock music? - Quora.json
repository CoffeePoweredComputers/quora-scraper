            "answer_text": "I agree with many of the bands mentioned, particularly CSNY, the Beach Boys, the Beatles, Queen, Fleetwood Mac, the Four Seasons, R.E.M.  I\u2019ll add a few no one seems to have put out there: Elton John\u2019s classic 70s band (some examples: \u201cSomeone Saved My Life Tonight,\u201d \u201cMona Lisas and Mad Hatters,\u201d and the aptly named \u201cHarmony,\u201d which has some of my favorite backup vocal work).  Pink Floyd\u2019s Gilmour and Wright were great, particularly on early 70s stuff like \u201cEchoes,\u201d \u201cBurning Bridges,\u201d and \u201cWot's . . . Uh The Deal.\u201d  And, though not conventional or what would be ordinarily be thought of as pretty, Jagger and Richards at the Rolling Stones\u2019 peak were amazing. Apart, their voices were somewhat flawed, but together they were perfect\u2014so perfect, it\u2019s hard to fathom either of them singing with anyone else. \u201cWild Horses,\u201d \u201cBrown Sugar,\u201d \u201cHonky Tonk Women,\u201d \u201cBeast of Burden,\u201d \u201cJumpin' Jack Flash,\u201d \u201cLet it Loose,\u201d and especially \u201cMemory Motel\u201d are  examples that spring to mind, but really any time those two voices came together it was special. (Note, most of the songs I mentioned are rockers, and it\u2019s a lot harder to find good harmony on rockers than on ballads.) ",

            "answer_text": "A few quick suggestions: WAR, the Beatles, the Beach Boys, R.E.M., Supremes, Earth, Wind and Fire, Yes, CSN&Y, Temptations, Martha and the Vandellas, the Shangri-Las, Chicago, Kinks, Everly Brothers, Isley Brothers, Foreigner, Yardbirds, Duran Duran, the Byrds, the Four Seasons, Depeche Mode, and the Osmonds. Elton John's peak band (on Goodbye Yellow Brick Road) did great harmony work. A lot of great singers (Whitney, Mariah, Mary J.) started out as backing singers. You can make jokes about that if you want, but I think the experience is a great way to build and solidify musicianship. I think we're in an interesting period where a lot of eccentric indy artists are harmonizing with themselves with gorgeous in-studio results - Glasser and Austra come to mind. Kate Bush and Meredith Monk are kind of the matron saints there. ",
