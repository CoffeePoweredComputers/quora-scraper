            "answer_text": "The best definition of a mixtape is \"an album released without authorization from a record company.\" Because they are almost always built on unauthorized samples of other songs, they are technically illegal: the law does not distinguish the production and sale of these CD's from the production and sale of bootleg commercial CD's. For this reason, the majority of mixtapes are released online, though some (Lil Wayne's 2006 Dedication 2 springs to mind[1]) have grown popular enough to be sold in Best Buy. (Record labels have also retroactively released authorized versions of mixtapes, as Drake's insanely popular So Far Gone (2009) was.)  Rappers often collaborate with DJ's and producers on their mixtapes, whereas current rap albums are rarely produced by only one person (even Kanye, who rose to fame as a producer before making it as a rapper, lets others fill in for him). They're also far easier to record and produce: since all you need is a rapper and an instrumental of a popular song, it is possible to record a staggering amount of music. This, when done properly, can have a measurable effect on a rapper's career: Lil Wayne released some of his most critically acclaimed work during an unprecedented deluge of mixtapes from 2004-2008. Others, such as Gucci Mane and Gorilla Zoe (the latter released 28 mixtapes in 28 days), have followed in his footsteps. Though they allow established rappers to stay current and connect to their audience, mixtapes also help artists rise to prominence: Drake, Kid Cudi, and Wiz Khalifa all attracted major-label attention thanks to solid mixtape buzz.
