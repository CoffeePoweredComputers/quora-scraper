            "answer_text": "Great question, I see no one gave you an accurate answer though. Read below Before I explain why Eminem dissed Lil Wayne, first I\u2019ll have to give you some details about Wayne\u2019s rap career. From 2005\u20132010, Wayne was the biggest rapper in the world. His main buzz started with the release of his album Tha Carter II in 2005. Prior to the release of the album, Wayne released a single called \u201cFireman\u201d to promote the album. Tha Carter II went platinum in 6 weeks. Fast forward to 2006, Wayne released \u201cDedication 2\u201d, which is a mixtape. If you google \u201cTop 50 mixtapes of the millennium\u201d, an article by Pitchfork will pop up. Pitchfork has \u201cDedication 2\u201d as number 6 on their greatest mixtapes. Fast forward to 2007, Wayne released yet another free mixtape titled \u201cDa Drought 3\u201d. Da Drought 3 is regarded as the greatest mixtape of all time by many, Pitchfork has it at #1. At this time, Wayne was calling himself \u201cThe Greatest Rapper alive\u201d and he was proving it by being consistent and rapping on other rappers beats better than themselves. His wordplay and flow was untouchable. Obviously calling yourself the greatest rapper would rub other rappers the wrong way and make them want to diss you. Back then, if Lil Wayne remixed your song it wasn\u2019t your song anymore and that\u2019s what his mixtapes consisted of, him rapping on other rappers beats. In the midst of releasing all these free mixtapes that anyone could listen to without paying, Wayne was on darn near every song on the radio. Almost every musical artist was featuring him to the point to where every time you turned on the radio, you heard Wayne. No rapper has done that many features within that amount of time. Now also in 2007, rapper 50 cent did an interview with Funk Masterflex where he asked 50 cent how he felt about Lil Wayne appearing on so many songs. 50 cent basically called Wayne a \u201crap whore\u201d for doing songs with any and everybody. The same year MTV named Wayne as #1 for their \u201cHottest MCs in the game\u201d list and 50 cent had something negative to say about that as well. 50 cent proceeded to diss Wayne in a song called \u201cpart time lover\u201d where he said \u201cI\u2019ll kiss you like Lil Wayne kisses Birdman\u201d. At the end of 2007, Wayne released a legendary song called \u201cGossip\u201d where he addresses all his haters but he doesn\u2019t specifically mention names. A year later a Wayne song called \u201cLouisianimal\u201d was leaked where Wayne dissed 50 cent by saying \u201cI\u2019m all about a dollar, Fuck 2 quarters, bitch I pour syrup in that vitamin water\u201d. ( 2 quarters is 50 cent obviously and vitamin water was 50 cents product). Wayne also dissed 50 in a song called \u201cLet\u2019s talk money\u201d with Pimp C where he said, \u201cThat nigga Pimp called me before he left this bitch; Told me keep doin\u2019 ya thing and don\u2019t tell 50 shit\u201d In that line, Wayne uses wordplay on 50 cents name and the 5\u20130 slang term which means police officer, basically calling 50 a rat. Pimp C died before this song was released and Wayne is saying Pimp C told him not to respond to 50 and just keep getting money. In 2008, Wayne released his biggest album, Tha Carter 3. It sold a million copies and went triple platinum. In the midst of all this, 50 cent was constantly dissing Wayne. This was a method of promotion for 50 cent. But Wayne stopped responding to 50 cent. Around 2008 is also when Wayne first reached out to Eminem to do a song together but Eminem didn\u2019t respond. Most likely because 50 cent and Eminem are very close friends, so how would he look doing a song with 50 cents enemy? Fast forward to 2009, 50 cent appeared on another radio show where they asked him about Wayne and 50 said \u201cWayne is a talented artist, you can\u2019t take that away from him, but if you put him a battle situation my consistency will break his neck\u201d. Now to the diss song in question, Eminem did a song with Pink in 2010 called \u201cWon\u2019t back down\u201d where he disses Wayne. It was off of his album \u201cThe Recovery\u201d so the song was probably recorded in early 2009. The line goes, \u201cLil Wayne slurps syrup til he burps and smokes purp does a word search gets circles rapped around him\u201d. Now also in 2010, Eminem appeared on Big Boy radio where Eminem reflected on a time when he was in a dark place and was jealous of Lil Wayne and Kanye West because of how popular they were and he wanted to do a diss song on them. But he said that dissing Wayne at the time would be \u201ccareer suicide\u201d for Eminem, himself. He was reflecting about a time years prior to 2010. Fast forward to 2011, Eminem did an interview with SiriusXM where he said \u201cLil Wayne is a dope rapper\u201d. Conclusion: Eminem dissed Lil Wayne because of his competitiveness and jealousy of how big Wayne was at the time. ",

            "answer_text": "Em said he considered dissing Wayne but felt he was just being a jealous hater so he didn't. Some speculate em took his chance to diss Wayne in Wayne's own song Drop the world but this is not true. There seems to be some confusion about a line that I believe was purely coincidental. Wayne had to approve ems verse to be in HIS song on HIS album so do you really think Wayne wud be like oh your dissing me on my own song that's great yeah lets go ahead and do that? Em and Wayne are on good terms and any line that makes people think em was dissing Wayne is pure coincidence. Em has never said that shot was aimed at lil Wayne. In short, Eminem has never disssd lil Wayne in any song period. If I tryed I could find many lil Wayne Lines in various songs that could seem like he was dissing Eminem but that would not mean lil Wayne dissed em either. If anything I'd bet they included that line just to make people wonder. if Eminem really wanted to diss lil Wayne it wud not be a secret he would make the diss very obvious and he would claim it. People create whatever they wana \"think\". I wont even go into the way people \"think\" em dissed Wayne but the \"diss\"people are referring to would be em replying to waynes verse in \"Forever\" on drop the world. If that's a diss it's the most subtle and weak diss Ive ever heard and em isn't known to be very subtle when he's dissing somebody. ",
