            "answer_text": "Just about all the Pre-Classical composers of the so-called Baroque Age of European Culture who almost everybody hasn't heard of. I've been singing in church and military choirs since about 1978 and have asked many fellow choir members, some of which are or have been professional musicians and have asked just about all the choir directors and accompaniests, instrumentalists and cantors who have all been, or are, or studying to be professional musicians if they like George Phillip Telemann or Jean Philipe Rameau and out of the approximately 200 singers, directors, accompaniests, cantors, and instrumentalists I have asked over a period of 40 years only one choir director and only one cantor has even heard of these two famous Baroque Music composers who are ranked in greatness on the greatness lists just below Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frederick Handel. So what this means to me is that the music schools are not doing their job in acquainting their music students with as many composers of the Baroque Period as possible besides Couperin, Vivaldi, Alessandro Scarlatti, Bach and Handel. So every other Baroque era composer has been made into not only a musician's musician but into a musician's, musician's musician or even a musician's, musician's, musician's musician. These then unknown composers by even other musicians are known only by musicologists. They are musicologists musicians. These musicologists musicians have written music that is vastly superior to most of the non-classical music being written today. The Baroque style is a superior style to the music style that gradually evolved after 1760 AD and became the overwhelmingly dominant style by 1780 AD and supplanted the Baroque Contrapuntal style which though most music historians insist that Johann Sebastian Bach exhausted all the potentialities of Baroque style and that is the reason why the simpler Classical chord-melody style that is still with us today in all the styles and genres of music supplanted the more complicated Baroque Contrapuntal style this is absolutely and incontrovertibly wrong. The simpler Classical chord-melody style was adopted because of money at the gate. It happened because of the chance for improved monetary gain. The simpler chord-melody style attracted more illiterate, mob-like people to the concerts who wanted secular stimulation. This happened around 1760 AD and was a cultural revolutionary prelude to the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror that cut tens of thousands of innocent people's heads off and wanted to destroy all the great medieval Cathedrals and reduce them to rubble for use as building supplies to build cheap housing for the rabble, the maddened illiterate mob. The ultimate result of this paranoid madness was Hitler's Holocaust of the Jews, the people of the Old Testament. Some other examples of great sounding and playing and liking and being a fan of musicologist's musicians are: Francesco Foggia, William Child, Thomas Mace, Abraham van den Kerckhoven, and Isabella Leonarda. I don't understand why people aren't flocking to the Baroque Era and constantly listening to all these Musicologist's Musicians that even professional Classical musicians have never heard of and seemingly never want to hear of and will even go out of their way not to hear of them. Other composers from the middle Baroque period are Constantin Christian Dedekind, Francesco Antonio Urio, and Carl Rosier. The middle Baroque period is when many of the mature Baroque musical forms were evolved so that the music always sounds up to date. Before the middle Baroque period the music can sound antiquated, but then again, Gregorian Chant sounds great and that predates middle Baroque by 600 years. By the late Baroque period( those composers born 1650 and after) the forms, instruments and virtuosity were well established and the composers could go on to write and perform the most glorious music ever written and improvised on. Improvisation was required in the Baroque period. If a musician could not improvise they were not really considered full musicians, in fact the ability to improvise was a pre-requisite to wanting to be and being a musician. We will never be able to hear the improvisations of the best improvisers of the Baroque period since nothing was recorded because the recording technology was not invented yet. What we can hope for is for Hiromi Uehara, to one by one pick several compositions by each of the composers she picks and improvise on their written works. Hiromi Uehara of Japan has been described as the Jazz pianist of the century. She is indescribable and brings tears to the eyes. She is so good and loves Music so much. She could not only bring the Baroque Composers to improvisational life and re-birth she could take the traditional musical heritage of every country in the world, lets say written from 1850 AD to 1925 AD, and do her thing with it; her incomparable rhythmic, melodic, and harmonic insane creativity; marvelous creativity, unparalleled creativity, unequaled creativity; her knowledgeable, masterful, command of all the musical idioms that have ever been invented. She must be the equal of the ever praised Baroque improvisers and the great improvisers of the Classical period and the Romantic period, before Classical Music got stultified by an avoidance of improvisation which is the origin and lifeblood of Music. Some of the composers of the late Baroque period that almost nobody, including musicians, have ever heard of are: Johann Krieger, Vincent Lubeck, Johann Casper Ferdinand Fischer, Giuseppe Ottavio Pitoni, Andre Campra, Nicolas Siret, Jean-Fery Rebel, Johann Christoph Pepusch, and Louis de Caix d'Hervelois. Culture repeats itself as new inventions are created out of that which went before. The academic disciplines, the Arts and Sciences, are not grouped together simply for simplicity and convenience; they are necessarily related to and influence one another. Scientific discoveries and new technologies created to enable scientific discoveries to continue to be made should find positive repercussions in the artistic division of the Arts and Sciences. Specific Arts whose practictioners arrogantly ignore and even treat with hostility, scientific research, discoveries, and groundbreaking scientific technology, are revealing themselves as very dissatisfied individuals who escaped into the world of the arts to specifically escape from the real world. These individuals will be among those who are drug users, excessive cane sugar addicts, tobacco users, excessive alcohol users, excessive caffeine users, trans-fats users, and excessive saturated fat users. Those individuals who are taking in these substances on a daily basis make themselves unable to appreciate the awesome latest discoveries in the scientific disciplines of Nutrition- Environmental Science(air and water quality), geology- earth science-planetary science, Astronomy-Botany-Chemistry, Physics-Mathematics-Zoology. Musicians should realize that it is important for them to realize it is important News that scientists have within the last two weeks said that there is enough water and oxygen on Mars that Sponges could be living in underground salty lakes all over, that is under, the Martian Surface, just waiting to be discovered by Earthly probes. Hiromi Uehara, by her emotions and the way she plays and improvises seems to be aware of everything that is happening in contemporary science. This is what makes the Baroque composers so great. In that age the Arts and Sciences were developing together and they all were excited by the discoveries in all the other fields. Nobody isolated themselves and considered themselves more important than all the practictioners in other fields based merely on the field they were in. Most of these awesome individuals knew each other and they sensed that the 17th century they lived in was a very important beginning for the Human Race. That is why the Improvisations in those days were absolutely phenomenal although we cannot hear any of it unless Hiromi Uehara devotes some time in Improvisationally exploring many of these composers she chooses. Hiromi might be the first great Improviser to mark the beginning of the 2nd great Golden Age of Improvisation, the Baroque Age being the 1st. Her compositions and improvisations will musically herald the discoveries in our Solar System and beyond our Solar System and the great technological inventions necessary to make those discoveries possible.
