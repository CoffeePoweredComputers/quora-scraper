            "answer_text": "There are several times you should avoid vibrato: If it\u2019s music by a living composer, if that composer says not to use vibrato, one should avoid it if physically possible, which it might not always be.If it\u2019s music that requires microtonal adjustments. Vibrato can obscure those, assuming you can do them in the first place.Any music from a period where the primary tuning system is based on pure intervals, because the vibrato will break those up. This includes the Middle Ages, where pure perfect fifths reigned, and the Renaissance and early Baroque eras, where pure major thirds and all they entailed prevailed.In music that is very dissonant, particularly not on the notes that are dissonant.On weak syllables.",

            "answer_text": "In most early music, vibrato is completely out of place. To sing the music of Victoria, Palestrina, and Allegri with vibrato is stylistically wrong. It's also wrong for certain avant-garde pieces. Jazz and popular artists sometimes sing without vibrato to create a mood of disillusionment, langor, sensuality, or world-weariness. Leonard Cohen and Astrud Gilberto are two examples. And some choral music can be better without vibrato, which blurs the musical lines.    ",

            "answer_text": "There is no hard and fast rule about use of vibrato. The classical voice is defined by vibrato of a quarter tone either side of the note Apart from that, vibrato has been used as an expressive device over the years, one must learn to control it and not let it control you. Some older recordings are ruined (to the modern ear) by excessive and continuous use of vibrato. Good luck. ",
