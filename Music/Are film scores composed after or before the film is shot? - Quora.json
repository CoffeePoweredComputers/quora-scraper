            "answer_text": "Generally most movies are composed after the shoot, though some director-composer collaborations will \u2018build\u2019 the score as they make the film (composing to locked sequences). I gather John Ottman has done this with Bryan (X-MEN/THE USUAL SUSPECTS) Singer, especially as he\u2019s also Maestro Singer\u2019s editor too, and I believe Hans Zimmer\u2019s music to CRIMSON TIDE for Tony Scott was done this way too.  Sometimes, as others have said, the composer will be asked to write a musical piece well beforehand, like this \u2013 280. JOHN BARRY - Romance for Guitar and Orchestra from DEADFALL (1968) by James McLean on Quora Instrumentalists' Club The great John Barry wrote this for the movie DEADFALL in 1968 (THE ROMANCE FOR GUITAR AND ORCHESTRA) \u2013 he\u2019s also the conductor you see here too!  Another example was \u2013 171. MICHAEL KAMEN \u2013 An American Symphony (from MR. HOLLAND\u2019S OPUS) (1995) by James McLean on Quora Instrumentalists' Club AN AMERICAN SYMPHONY, composed by the loveable Michael Kamen in 1995 for MR. HOLLAND\u2019S OPUS.  A little symphony that\u2019s big fun!  But, as to doing the scores beforehand, Germany\u2019s Tom Tykwer (RUN LOLA RUN, THE INTERNATIONAL, CLOUD ATLAS) does this, with his usual collaborators Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heil, and edits his tracks to fit. Here\u2019s the Sextet from CLOUD ATLAS \u2013    As you may know, Maestro Tykwer co-directed CLOUD ATLAS with the Wachowskis, who were so suitably impressed at his way of working on the score that they\u2019ve decided that this is how the music will be done on all their films in future, starting with this one \u2013     \u2013 courtesy of Oscar-winner Michael Giacchino.  So looking forward to it! Soooo, as others have said, it varies quite a bit, but generally it\u2019s after the film is shot.  Still, I hope this answer proves that there\u2019s more than one way to skin a cat! (sorry Chris B!) ",

            "answer_text": "The two answers above are not wrong but miss a powerful instance where the picture is cut to the music (so the music is composed first).  Often a director wants to use a particular piece of music and wants that music to drive the picture.  In this case an edit of the music is brought into post production where the film's editor cuts the scene to the music. S/he will pay particular attention to the tempo of the music and may try to match particular climaxes in the music. That way, as the music builds, so does the scene.  It doesn't have to be popular music either such as what Martin Scorsese is known for. It could just be that the film's producer wants the music to drive the scene so s/he has the composer write the score first and once s/he approves it has the editor cut the music. Keep an eye/ear out for it.  It is very powerful.  Enjoy!Stuart RidgwayComposer Pyramid Digital Productions, Inc. http://pyramidmusic.com ",

            "answer_text": "Usually the music is recorded after the film so that the music can fit precisely to the scenes shot. Therefore you can as a musician generally see the scenes as you record, albeit out of running order.  A famous instance was ET where apparently Steven Spielberg told John Williams he would fit the film to the score he wrote for the flying scene (the chase and build up to the bike flying). Therefore that's one of my favourite pieces of film music as John Williams had creative license to create an amazing few minutes without worrying about the music fitting to the film. ",
