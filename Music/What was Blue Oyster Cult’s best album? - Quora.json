            "answer_text": "Blue Oyster Cult is such a great band, totally underrated with interesting lyrics, fluid guitar leads and multiple vocalists. I think their best studio album is Secret Treaties. It was their third album, and every song is solid. It contains no real radio hits like Don't Fear the Reaper or Burning for You, but it does have influential classics like Career of Evil, Astronomy, Flaming Telepaths and Dominance and Submission. This album put everything together for BOC, awesome songs, mystery and solid production. Agents of Fortune was the next album and through Reaper, elevated them to stardom, but Treaties was the springboard. Check it out- as well as their other material their catalog is deep and satisfying. ",

            "answer_text": "Since I\u2019m going to see them tommorrow night in Louisville, Ky I\u2019ll weigh in. BOC are known to be an especially good live band and have almost as many live releases as they do studio recordings. Of their studio work I think Secret Treaties squeaks by Tyranny & Mutation for top honors. It\u2019s a coherent experience that comes across as almost a concept album. Hard rockers Dominance & Submission and Harvester of Eyes nestle nicely with ethereal tracks like Astronomy and Subhuman. Not a throwaway track on the album. For live work the general consensus is Some Enchanted Evening, which was re-released in 2007 in an expanded format. If you don\u2019t like this album you won\u2019t like them. My personal favorite though is On Your Feet or on Your Knees. ",
