            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re looking to become a better listener, there are several things you can try. I learned a great deal from taking an Active Listening course that was part of a Counselling program at a local college - it was a REALLY good decision. It\u2019s helped me in numerous areas of my life both personally and professionally. Next time, when you find yourself listening to a friend about their day or perhaps a grievance, practice the following: Don\u2019t give advice. (And especially don\u2019t think of things as they talk!)Hear what they say, consider their perspective and what they might have felt. Never AssumeIt may seem obvious but never assume you know how a person is feeling. It\u2019s tempting to say, \u201cYou must have been so angry\u201d or \u201cWow - that\u2019s humiliating.\u201d Instead, use phrases like, \u201cit seems like\u201d, or \u201cit sounds as if\u201d. You may be surprised at what else is going on for that person and they will feel more inclined to share with you (because you don\u2019t cut them off). Allow some silenceIn my experience, I\u2019ve found that we often think we need to \u201cfill the gaps\u201d during periods of silence. In these moments, we are likely going to offer advice or start talking about our on experiences. Instead, I offer to try and allow some silence. STAY PRESENT (ie. don\u2019t start thinking about your weekend plans or what to say next). The person may need some time to process and often things will come up and they\u2019ll start talking again. Ask Open-Ended QuestionsIf there\u2019s a VERY long silence or it seems like the person is feeling shut-down or unsure, ask an open-ended question. This means they cannot answer the question with a simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cnow\u201d. For example, \u201cWhat did you feel after you heard the news?\u201d is open-ended, versus \u201cWere you angry?\u201d (closed question). Hope that helps! ",
