Actually, they had to answer this question in one interview - who is the better guitarist and who is the handsome one. Kruspe joked: \u201cI\u00b4ll take the handsome.\u201d To which Landers laughed.

            "answer_text": "Rammstein is unusual for a metal band, in that their music doesn't rely on guitar-solos. Its like they have a line-up with two rythm-guitarists. However, its Richard Z. Kruspe who plays the few solos they have. Conventional wisdom therefore makes him the better guitarist. ",
