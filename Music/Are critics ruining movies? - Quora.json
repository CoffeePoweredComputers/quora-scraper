            "answer_text": "No. Audiences are just crybabies. Here\u2019s why: I love trash movies. I love them. I\u2019m not talking big productions with bad reviews like Batman vs Superman bad. No, I\u2019m talking Sharknado, Two Headed Shark Attack, Lavalantula, Mega Shark vs Crocosaurus bad. How bad, you ask? This bad.  Why is this important? Because at no point will I ever dare call them good movies and I agree with the critics that love trashing these films. They\u2019re atrocious as both films and projects, but the fact that they\u2019re bad, and that critics agree that they\u2019re bad, doesn\u2019t make my enjoyment any less real. For some bizarre, unexplainable reason, people nowadays seem to believe that critics not liking a movie means audiences who liked them are wrong. They need critics to tell them \u201cyes this movie is good\u201d in order to enjoy it guilt free, or else, they\u2019ll say the critics are wrong or are \u201cruining movies\u201d. I\u2019ve spoken about this before when talking about Venom (which I enjoyed), but movie critics don\u2019t usually take into consideration audience enjoyment when reviewing a film. Acting, direction, photography, score, editing, writing, sound design, music, etc. All of these elements and more come together to create a project. Some movies are amazing in each and every one of these aspects, yet can be very boring for the regular moviegoer. I studied film and I remember falling asleep in more than one superb film, simply because I just didn\u2019t care about the subject. I could recognize that the film was amazing and would drool over certain aspects of the filmmaking process, yet I\u2019d end up drifting off during the movie because there wasn\u2019t enough happening for my personal taste. Likewise, I can recognize each and every flaw of the trash movies I enjoy watching, yet I like watching them nevertheless because I like dumb movies. Of course I notice the weird continuity errors, the unrealistic dialogue, the bad stock footage and, you know, the stupidity of it all. I don\u2019t care one bit. They\u2019re not good, they\u2019ll never be good films and they\u2019ve never aspired to be good films. They\u2019re just dumb movies for dumb fun. The fact that movie experts can all agree that those movies are awful matters not. I like them. Period. So no, critics aren\u2019t ruining movies. Audiences just want to be told the movies they like are good, regardless of quality, and will throw a fit if critics \u2018make them\u2019 feel bad about their movie preferences. \u2013\u2013\u2013 As for movie critics criticizing a movie and studios being afraid that the criticism will cause the movie to underperform? Good. If a film is shitty enough that it tanks after the first weekend, then it should tank after the first weekend. It\u2019s not some conspiracy. It\u2019s just audiences reacting to a genuinely bad and boring film. There have been huge blockbusters with very bad reviews and enormous audiences, so critics have very little sway on what people want to watch or not. ",

            "answer_text": "No. For one thing, people are generally more likely to take the word of someone they actually know as to whether a movie is worth seeing or not than the word of someone who gets paid to write professional reviews; and for another thing, social media holds the biggest impact in spreading opinions about a movie than anything else nowadays anyway. Take Bohemian Rhapsody, for example: it wasn\u2019t trashed by critics but they all complained that it was cliched, formulaic and generally a mediocre film. It\u2019s still playing at my local cinema three months after its release (which has only happened before with Star Wars movies and Avengers: Infinity War), pulls in the second largest audience of any film on any given day (right behind Mary Poppins Returns) and pretty much everyone leaves with a smile on their face. The thing is, critics naturally sit through a frankly ridiculous number of movies, some good, most average and quite a few bad so naturally they will have a different view a lot of the time than the general public who really only go to see a movie a few times a year. That\u2019s not to say critics are redundant - there have been lots of now classic films that bombed or didn\u2019t do so well on release thanks to negative critical reception impacting audiences - or that they should never be taken seriously - there are plenty of times when opinions overlap, after all - but I think most people learn that it\u2019s best to form their own opinions on a movie either from someone they personally know who knows what kind of movie they\u2019ll enjoy, or just from seeing it themselves.

            "answer_text": "There have been movie critics for about as long as there have been movies, and there is very little correlation between a film\u2019s reviews and its box office, in that there are many critically panned films that do well at the box office and many critically praised films that do poorly. The main impact critics have on films is that they can get the word out about good films that do not have good marketing campaigns behind them. ",
