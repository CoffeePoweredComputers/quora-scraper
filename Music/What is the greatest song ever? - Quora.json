            "answer_text": "Ok, so just for you to know, I couldn\u2019t really do a list of the greatest songs ever because not a lot of songs that I listen could be identified as some of the \u201cgreatest\u201d due to critical acclaim, and also due to the music and lyrics, and I mean due to everything on these the songs. The songs on this list are not even equal to for example Stairway to Heaven or all that stuff, but I think they still are good and they mean something to me. I just find that they\u2019re really well made, or really creative, or I mean, I\u2019ll explain for each song. By the way, if you have songs to propose to me, I\u2019m taking them, because I\u2019m only 14 and I don\u2019t know a lot of songs. D\u00e9filer - StromaeSo just that you know, I\u2019m French, so this is a French song, BUT STAY, it\u2019s the only French one on the list, because I almost only listen to English songs. So I think that this song is really particular because it has this kind of pop vibe but in a more alternative way. The guy is probably the greatest French artist from the decade, and he has had a huge success with his last studio album. It was really crazy. But then he retired because it was too much success, and it was too overwhelming for him. And that\u2019s the first single he has released since his retirement. So in France, this was a pretty huge success. He\u2019s not planning on coming back, this was just the main theme for his fashion show thingy (he has a clothing brand). So the song is eight minutes long, and it talks about social media having control of us these days, and how image is getting sadly more and more important. He also talks in the middle about his depression that he had, when he didn\u2019t know why he kept doing music if he didn\u2019t like it, and it\u2019s kind of a bunch of statements that make you think about what you want to do and achieve and, are you comfortable with your current situation and all this. So some lyrics are pretty deep and make you think a lot, which is one of the biggest points of the song. And also the music is so special. He has three breaks where he changes totally the music in the song, and honestly, it goes totally in an incredible way. The transitions between the themes are impressive, really, and the middle theme is the best.  2. Kevin\u2019s Heart - J. Cole Ok, so I guess some of you probably already know this song. It was the biggest success of rapper J. Cole\u2019s last album; KOD. It has a really relaxing vibe, and it\u2019s really a good song to listen to when you feel a bit sad or tired. It talks about humorist Kevin Heart\u2019s feelings, and about how he had a relationship with another woman while married. It\u2019s a really well-written song, with nice bars and all that, (as always coming from J. Cole) and it talks really well about how Kevin felt when his wife and the media (basically the whole world) learned about his cheating. And the music behind is just so well found for the lyrics, there\u2019s this kind of mellow piano that plays this soft music in the background, that really makes you just want to relax, and the percussions are just so well-found. The music is kind of a mix between jazz and trap. It\u2019s just perfect.  3. Harder Better Faster Stronger - Daft Punk Ok so you all probably already know this song, for those who don\u2019t, it\u2019s probably the best Daft Punk song. It\u2019s a remix from a song called \u201cCola Bottle Shake Baby\u201d (I think) but it has really nothing to do with the original. It\u2019s an electronic kind of song, with just a robot voice singing the title of the song over and over again and one of the greatest electro beats playing behind, with two breaks and theme changes in the song. The end is arguably the best part because you can just hear the voice getting kind of cut when it\u2019s about to say something like for example: ha-er bet-er fa-er -ong-. I mean, I guess you see what I\u2019m talking about and it\u2019s almost like an instrument that\u2019s playing a solo. The song is just electro music, and it was a really game-changing song for alternative electro when it came out.  4. Batman - Jaden Ok so this one might surprise you a lot, but I actually think it\u2019s a good song. Ok, so we all agree Jaden has been doing shitty music for the last year, but his debut studio album \u201cSYRE\u201d was kind of creative, at least we can give it that. It had a few \u201cbangers\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d songs, but I think that this one, with \u201cIcon\u201d, is the one that stands out the most. Just because of the production. The theme behind is so well found, just these simple notes playing this sad melody, and the percussion and all the other sounds are just amazing. The lyrics aren\u2019t that great, though he has some lines in it. But in general, just a really good song to listen to when feeling kind of sad or angry. The music behind is really amazing, it\u2019s what makes the song an arguably great song. By the way, his singing at the end is dope.  5. XO Tour Llif3 - Lil Uzi Vert So this is a banger. A massive hit. We all know it. But honestly, it deserves it. Yes, I am talking about a mumble rap song, but trust me, it\u2019s not a usual mumble rap song. First, let\u2019s talk about the production behind it. It\u2019s totally crazy, this kind of tragic melody behind, extra sad melody we could call it, is just perfect, the sound of this instrument is amazing, the bass is really catchy and smashing, and I mean, everything is perfect. And now the lyrics. These are a bit less perfect than the music itself, but they still fit it. His voice is totally amazing, his singing is great, fits perfectly the song, and the chorus, although no one can refer to it, is strangely catchy. The lyrics basically talk about a usual break-up situation (and a traumatic one, really) but it really is perfect for the song. Just the best song to listen to when feeling extremely sad, or angry.  6. Nowadays (feat. Landon Cube) - Lil Skies So this song is one of the first songs from almost mumble rapper Lil Skies, but honestly, it\u2019s his best one since he has begun rapping. It has such a relaxing vibe that\u2019s with it, and it really makes you feel that California/West Side vibe. It\u2019s a summer hit, but besides it, everything\u2019s awesome. The piano with the melody is just so catchy and relaxing, and the percussions and bass behind it, although quite simple, fit it just the right way. Landon\u2019s lyrics on it are not that great, but his singing is, and Lil Skies\u2019s lyrics are both great and well sung. He\u2019s basically just talking about some young twenty-year-old shit that any new kind of emo/mumble rapper would say these days, but he says it in such a way\u2026 it\u2019s really relaxing. And the singing makes everything.  7. Sweet Child O\u2019 Mine - Guns N\u2019 Roses So although I don\u2019t find the main theme really attracting and catchy, I must admit it\u2019s cool. I mean the lyrics are ok, the singing\u2019s great, and the melody is well found but not really catchy, nothing more. The thing that really makes the song one of the best songs of Guns N\u2019 Roses is the guitar solo. The guitar solo is really long, and to be honest, it\u2019s really amazing. One of the best guitar solos of all time (that I\u2019ve heard at least). The notes are just perfect where they are, and I mean that\u2019s just it. It\u2019s funny how just a solo can make a song totally different. I mean this solo, goddamn, you don\u2019t hear a lot of solos like this one I can guarantee you.  8. Souk Eye - Gorillaz Ok, so one of the most underrated Gorillaz songs of all time. It\u2019s my favorite song of all time to listen to when feeling melancholic, or sad, or kind of happy, or just tired. The music behind is just mind-blowing, I mean honestly, it\u2019s so beautiful. Just listen to the guitar melody and you\u2019ll understand. The music just grows and grows during the song, until the end when it\u2019s really the apogee. And the lyrics, although a bit mumbled, are really relaxing. I mean his voice is one of the best voices there exists right now, so special and deep. He\u2019s just talking about his love for Los Angeles I think, or maybe a girl I didn\u2019t look into them that much. But the singing just fits the song perfectly. It\u2019s like an instrument.  9. Do I Wanna Know? I hope you all already know this song because otherwise, you\u2019re missing out. One of the best songs of Arctic Monkeys for certain, almost at the level of some songs of their debut studio album. The guitar melody behind and the way it evolves along the song is just so amazing. His lyrics are so well found for the song, honestly, and nothing more to say about it. It\u2019s just a really cool rock song to listen to.  10. The Real Slim Shady - Eminem Ok, so you all already know the melody and stuff, really one of the best classics of hip-hop, no need to further explain. Dope melody, dope lyrics, everything. I just wanted to remind some people that it\u2019s still here.  So this was my top 10, and then these are just the other songs of my Top 50 if it interests you. No description under them, it would be too long to write. 11. Carmen - Stromae  12. Rap God - Eminem  13. Feel Good Inc. - Gorillaz  14. Killing Strangers - Marilyn Manson  15.

            "answer_text": "What makes a great song? It\u2019s a big question, to me, the lyrics of the song are equally important as the chorus, structure and melody. It's a very subjective thing, different people like different parts of a song. If i was to pick out some of the greatest songs I've ever heard then my list will have different songs than what you generally find on such lists. Hallelujah- Jeff Buckley. Leonardo Cohen's pure poetry sung by Jeff Buckley with all the anguish in his heart, Hallelujah is a song whose theme touch on love, sex, religion, longing and regret from the past. Some piece of lyrics from the song- \u201cYour faith was strong but you needed proofYou saw her bathing on the roofHer beauty and the moonlight overthrew herShe tied you to a kitchen chairShe broke your throne, and she cut your hairAnd from your lips she drew the Hallelujah\u201d Maybe there's a God aboveBut all I ever learned from loveWas how to shoot at someone who outdrew youIt's no complaint you hear tonightIt's not some pilgrim who's seen the lightIt's a cold and it's a lonely Hallelujah 2. Here comes the Sun- The Beatles.  George Harrison wrote this in Eric Clapton's garden using one of Clapton's acoustic guitars. Here comes the sun reflects on a depressive episode that we all can leave behind and look at the brighter clear future that lays ahead. It is a song about being happy, the type of song you would want to hear when you let go of all the things holding you back and walk on the path of awakening. Harrison's guitar playing makes the lyrics even memorable. Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winterLittle darling, it feels like years since it's been hereHere comes the sunHere comes the sun, and I sayIt's all right Little darling, the smiles returning to the facesLittle darling, it seems like years since it's been hereHere comes the sunHere comes the sun, and I sayIt's all right 3. All Along the Watchtower- Jimmy Hendrix.  Bob Dylan's lyrical masterpiece accompanied by Jimi Hendrix's out of the world guitar playing and vocals. All Along the watchtower was a part of Jimi Hendrix's electric ladyland album. Hendrix while starting with All Along the Watchtower said \u201cAll those people who don't like Bob Dylan's songs should read his lyrics. They are filled with the joys and sadness of life. I am as Dylan, none of us can sing normally. Sometimes, I play Dylan's songs and they are so much like me that it seems to me that I wrote them\u201d Jimi Hendrix's version of the song had a larger impact than what Bob Dylan's original song could have and it went on to became the best cover song ever made in history.
