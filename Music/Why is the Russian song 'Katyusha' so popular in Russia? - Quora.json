            "answer_text": "The premise of the question is wrong. Katyusha isn\u2019t popular in Russia, it\u2019s popular in the whole world. See Daniel Ptashny's answer to What popular songs have been translated into the most number of languages? Besides for being a beautiful song with beautiful words, I think the message of the song is a very powerful one and one that speaks to many people. It\u2019s a message of hope and sacrifice, of love and a deep sense of mission. For contrast, let\u2019s examine two other songs with similar content: Erika in German, and another one of my favorites - Smuglyanka. A soldiers morale will definitely go up when he remembers his Erika back at home, but it\u2019s more of a personal thing. Besides for the fact that this song is lacking her side, she encouraging him; in addition when he\u2019s thinking about Erika it\u2019s only about her. The mission is important, but only as secondary to her; or maybe even only for her, to protect her. The mission in itself is of secondary importance, if at all. These aren\u2019t the words of the song, but it\u2019s the feeling I get out of it. Smuglyanka is the polar opposite. Here, the Smuglyanka is reprimanding the boy for flirting while he should be with the Partisans at the front. Sort of like saying \u201cno more monkey business, get to work\u201d. Although joyous, it does have a damn serious message. The thing is, it doesn\u2019t seem like the boy really gets it, he\u2019s a bit reluctant. This is reflected - in my understanding - in the lines \u201c\u0412 \u0442\u043e\u043c \u043e\u0431\u0438\u0434\u0443 \u044f \u0443\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043b, \u0427\u0442\u043e \u0441 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430\u201d (\u201cI was hurt that she didn\u2019t invite me to come with her\u201d). All in all, it\u2019s a powerful song, but it ain\u2019t Katyusha. This starts off joyous, as both are on their posts and happy with it. I don\u2019t mean that each is happy where they are, Katyusha is also happy that the warrior is holding his post, the fact that they\u2019re far away doesn\u2019t affect their feelings for one another one bit. In fact, it only makes it greater; not in a sense of longing, but more in a sense of pride. How goes the last line? \u201c\u041f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043e\u043d \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044e \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0443\u044e, \u0430 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u044c \u041a\u0430\u0442\u044e\u0448\u0430 \u0441\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0435\u0442\u201d (\u201clet him guard the motherland, and I will guard the love). To sum it up, the other two songs are about longing (which may be a boost of morale or may be a disturbance, but that isn\u2019t the point). But Katyusha talks about mutual sense of responsibility. I also tend to get the feeling that Katyusha has a subtle message of hope the other ones are lacking, but I can\u2019t pinpoint where exactly. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually, the song \u201cKatyusha\u201d was written before the World War II, but it became very popular during the war and it is now viewed as a \u201cfolk song\u201d. It is a beautiful song with a simple upbeat tune. The tune is easy to sing, even for children. For example, my son, who is ten years old, learned it a few years ago and can still sing a few verses. The author of the lyrics Mikhail Isakovskiy (\u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0418\u0441\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439) also wrote many other still popular songs, like \u201cOi, tsvetet kalina\u201d (\u041e\u0439, \u0446\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430\u201d), and \u201cKakim ty byl, takim ostalsya\u201d(\u041a\u0430\u043a\u0438\u043c \u0442\u044b \u0431\u044b\u043b, \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u043c \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0441\u044f). Th composer, Matvej Blunter (\u041c\u0430\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0439 \u0418\u0441\u0430\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0411\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440) is well know for his war-time marches, but he is also the author of some romances, like Zhdi menya\u201d ( \u0416\u0434\u0438 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f), \u201cV gorodskom sadu igraet\u201d (\u0412 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0430\u0434\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0442). This last one was my grandmothers\u2019s favourite. There are lots of great songs written about (or during) the war. Many of them are still popular because they are just that good. And catchy. I am quite sure that not-quite-sober company of youngsters that sang \u201cKatyusha\u201d under my window did it without thinking about war or weapons. ",
