            "answer_text": "Wizkid used to be the shit! I still remember when his Superstar album came out, and till now I dance and sing along to every single song on it. It never fails to hype me up. Every song there is fire.  And then Ayo came out, and although it was a bit loose in its relation to his rap abilities in Superstar, I still liked it. Ojuelegba is still one of my top songs from him. Now his music has gotten so diluted that I don't even know what his newest album is called. Something about the other side? Ugh. I just don't care. Since his explosion in the international public eye, he has succumbed to the pop music pressure and hardly ever raps any more. I mean his latest song with Drake Closer was basically just him saying \u201cuhhh, yeah, uhhh yeah, uhhh, Yeah, baby come closer\u201d. What the fuck is that? Is it supposed to be music? I accept that many people won't agree with me, and I'm happy for him for making it big and working globally. It's more money afterall. But I miss the old Wizzy. The one who was a bit more raw. In contrast, I have never, and probably will never, get Davido. Like, does he even have albums? I'm seriously asking. ",

They both have hit songs, they\u2019ve both won awards. Oh, they both are fathers. I mean\u2026 But they have different background which I believe molded them into how they handle life. Some will say Davido is more generous, some will say wizkid is more calm headed. These things added to their music makes them who they are. IMO, as long as the beat is banging, I\u2019m dancing. ",
