            "answer_text": "it was one done by my band back in 1967 the Greensleeves it was across of Folk, Rock and Surf all roll into one group\u2026 we were recording a demo tape to take it to radio station to see if we could play at their local rock show..all we had was an old reel to reel tape player that had two mics a right channel and a left channel\u2026we were fuckin with it and trying to place the mics in the right place to get the right sounds.after about 40 minutes or so we began to play we did a couple of takes and found the right sound and the right piece to turn in to the radio station..one of the band singers took the tape home and was going to cut the tape down to the right size the station needed to hear for consideration to play on their Rock Show and Dance on a Saturday Night\u2026.well he cut down all right to about 45 seconds ..blank tape with some sound like a guitar dropping, my drum sticks hitting the rim of the snare and shit like that\u2026it seems like that his Mom was cleaning up after him and mix up the tapes and he grab the wrong tape not knowing that his Mom mix them up..I dont know why he didnt throw away the crap and just kept our recorded tape we could have been famous and have been Rock Stars\u2026\u2026.we never did get to play at the Rock Show right after that I broke my right foot in a big skiing accident and could not play the drums the Greensleeves broke up..the tape went missing and I never did get to be a Rock Star..we should be listed as the shortest song ever it was recored about 2 seconds worth of crap\u2026.thats my 2 cents ",

            "answer_text": "The best short song l know is by the Dead Kennedy's but there is a one second single by another band which is in the Guinness Book of Records. \u201cYou Suffer\" is a song by the British grindcore band Napalm Death, from their debut album, Scum. It is precisely 1.316 seconds long and has four words. The song has since been recognized by Guinness World Records as the shortest ever recorded.  One of the better short songs l know is \u201cShort Songs\u201d by the Dead Kennedy's which lasts barely 20 seconds and was recorded live at the Deaf Club & first featured on a live multi-artist compilation.  While \u201cYou Suffer\" is more of a novelty, on some days \u201cShort Songs\" has everything you could possibly want in a song. It features on the well named compilation round-up \u201cGive Me Convenience or Give Me Death\". ",
