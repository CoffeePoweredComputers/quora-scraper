            "answer_text": "Apparently a lot of music fans. I count at least 30 companies in 2019 selling CD players from about $200 USD to over $10,000 and several of those offer more than one model. I don\u2019t think there are nearly as many different makers of DVD players these days. People still enjoy collecting a physical CD, plus they know the recording will be on their shelf without worrying that a streaming company may lose the rights to some artists. ",

            "answer_text": "One could, but there are smarter options nowadays. Any laptop can play a CD. The problem is that the sound output from the laptop\u2019s own digital to audio converter (DAC) is usually miserable. The solution is to use a DAC attached to the USB port of the laptop. The Audioquest Dragonfly is one such extremely portable equipment which though not cheap is a more affordable option to buying a high end CD player. Other important additional investment should go into quality - laptop to pre-amplifier to amplifier to speaker connections and room acoustics. ",
