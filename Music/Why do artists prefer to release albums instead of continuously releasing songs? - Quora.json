            "answer_text": "Probably because they want you to hear their work--all of it and not just that one single you like. In the days of LPs and cassettes, you had to sit through songs you didn't like much in order to get to the songs you did. For example, when The Rolling Stones released Let It Bleed, I had it on cassette. I liked the song Monkey Man and not much else. But to get to Monkey Man, I usually listened or sat through the other songs on the album. Over time I came to like those other songs and it became my favorite album. It also changed my taste in music.  Now with the ability to shuffle or just buy only the songs you like, for better or worse, the art of the album is in decline. ",

            "answer_text": "There are some good points being made on this thread. I\u2019ve read and listened to a ton of interviews over the years. My understanding is that many of the old school musicians, like Garth Brooks, look at the entire album as being a one piece of art that was meant to experienced together. An entire story. In my opinion it is more advantageous to release songs by the single these days. You can always can compile them in an album down the road. I go into much more detail on why releasing singles is the way to go on my blog. Feel free to read it if you\u2019d like. 4 Reasons You Should Release Your Music By The Single (And How To Do It) ",
