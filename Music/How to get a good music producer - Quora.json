            "answer_text": "First develop a really great marketable set of musical skills. This would be songwriting, arranging, and playing if possible at least two or three instruments. If you can do this well then you will have a good chance of finding a producer. Songwriting is very, very important. You should practice writing at least one song per week. Keep a book of your lyrics and your music if even you singing and playing an acoustic guitar on our computers videocam. It is great practice to do this consistently even if this is all you can afford. It is a tool that you already have. It is great to see your performance and can give you an idea how you come across on stage. If you already have demos and other items such as a press kit then consider approaching some local producers and call some local studios. Managers can also help you sometimes with production or finding a producer. Networking at open stages is also a great idea. You never know who might be in the audience. The opportunity to network with other artists is very helpful, Furthermore, you can always ask a local artist whose sound you like and admire if they might consider working with you. Expect to pay your producer. The fees for a local producer will be much less than an national producer. In general you should expect to pay approximately $20 to $100 per hour depending on the credits of the producer and if they have hit credits. It may be even more if you wanted to work with the big names. I would suggest that regardless of what you decide to do that you do save some money for your sessions to pay the producer. This fee will be outside of the studio cost. I think that your best bet is to find someone local and somewhat established to help you. This type of person will be up-and-coming and more willing to give you a break. Be sure to listen to music they have produced in the past. Don't be afraid to approach anyone. Just ask. Good luck. I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions. ",

            "answer_text": "This all depends on what your ideas of a producer is. There are producers whom only work on their own, perhaps with a few collaborators. Then there are ones who work with various bands/musicians. At some point many people out there obtained a DAW (digital audio workstation) software and started producing music under their favorite music genre, calling themselves a producer. Many of these persons never had any formal music training or attended technology classes relating to the music technology field such as Electronic Music Engineer. or Recording Engineer. Some one who is trained with or have sessions in Mastering and understand the elements of mixing and arranging. A good producer will have the skills to mix down a track, hence working with many band projects, this person could be doubled as arranger. This would be on a professional realm. There are many out there that make, create a few good musical works and claim the title of producer but not really a true producer. Under this guise, if you make music, you yourself could be a producer. As myself, I am a musician, but I have published 10 albums on my own and have worked with a large array of artists behind the scenes. Most of the time, the producer is never really spotlighted, perhaps credited in the metadata of the digital file or the credits of a album or song, Some would do an entire album and others would do just one track. Depending on what the artist wants to do. the artist makes the music, the producer gets it recorded. The idea, that a musician is published, is the borderline determination to call themself a producer. If you are looking for a producer whom would be a middle man, look for who is very knowledgeable with A&R, consulting , mastering professionals, publishers, SEO, and many different lines of engineering professionals to produce a record. then you would have to connect in places like MediaBase, BMI and Ascap and also certain colleges that have department based on Production or all aspects of Music Engineering. Having a list of other services to vehicle your album, single to the right market However, if you are just looking, for example, you have lyrics and you are a singer and want a musician to perform the music, which would be lot more inexpensive, then there are many guys who can import your recorded lyrics into their DAW and create a music track. Some have small or medium studios where you can go and record your singing, or as I do at times, have singers and telecommute, sending files via internet. Your question is low on description, if this is what you want, then there are a vast amount of musicians online such as soundcloud, bandcamp, reverbnation or even on craigslist. Over all the title of Producer is almost a out dated, before digital technology a band or musician had to have a team member with their band who actually did the recording,,such as the band leader of sorts, he/she was the person who took all the elements of the band and got them to reel to reel or took their music to certain avenues kind of like a lobbyist would take issues to the floor, he was sort of a vehicle to put the band out to the A&R. Today we have digital recording which eliminates all most of all the other technology and the internet replaces all the avenues that a producer would have needed, to vehicle his band project to the appropriate label and venue connections. I coin the title of producer because have under my belt my albums and have worked with many other band/musicians as the guy who composed their musical tracks and have sent pieces and parts of music measures riffs, drums, instrumental parts, to other musicians such as professional singers or even contracts with cinema working on movie scores. I act sort of like a label, having my own band project and then rostering several bands/acts, which I work behind the scenes, using many parts of technology, synthesizers, drums, keyboard elements. Getting their tracks to mixed stem files to send to mastering, but I have started mastering my own brand bands that I roster and publish their tracks/albums, then I get royalties from their music sales. Since I am also a musician, I then, dont call myself a label. This is a example of how many in the business are doing it today. There are many different ways producers can break down their forte, some could be a full musician, like a composer, you give them lyrics he gives you a full rendered music piece for professional sales, or he can make multifaceted parts for movies and cinema or make/compose music loops for loops.midi sales companies or making beats for people who require drum and percussion, to working with more traditional music like working with a marching band, symphony, orchestra. There are many expanded ways this can go. You would have to have what you want listed and detailed to get a more concise idea across, because there are many different types of producers and there are many who call them self a producer yet never have put anything on the market. If its to do your lyrics and you want professional, you should look for a producer with several albums or tracks online, on sites like iTunes, these guys will know how to properly assign the right *meta data and get you the upc, irsc codes and get your music properly affiliated with BMI or ASCAP. metadata is the information coded into a digital file. Which itunes requires this, a cover art piece and upc, irsc codes and stipulate the quality of the recording, deem the material to legitimatize, clearing any copy rights and coded to the proper advisories if necessary, like adult or pg. if a guy doesn't know this, like you need to send a wav/aff file, not a mp3, then you may want to look at some one else. These would be the basic things a producer would need to know to make your music into a marketable item.",

            "answer_text": "If you have a recording contract that would not be a problem, presuming you have not you would either have to go the local route or internet. The local route may be more practical depending on your genre of music, simple check out the local studios and listen to their demos. Talk to local musicians to see if they recommend anyone, be aware though you will probably have to pay unless the producer is willing to cut a deal. As for the internet you can check out some pro producers on sites like \u201cSoundbetter\u201d, again you will have to pay but you can check out there work via the site\u2026 ",
