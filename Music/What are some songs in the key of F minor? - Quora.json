I\u2019ll do a blend of songs and classical pieces: Aerosmith - \u201cDream On\u201d (already mentioned, but too good not to be mentioned again) Tchaikovsky - Symphony No. 4 (ditto) Dream Theater - \u201cThe Root of All Evil\u201d and \u201cOctavarium\u201d Led Zeppelin - \u201cWhen the Levee Breaks\u201d (kind of a modally ambivalent blend of Major/minor) Can\u2019t think of much else right now, f minor\u2019s not a very common main key of many musical works, although it can be used in passing and in certain parts of a piece quite often. Just thought of another: Dream Theater - \u201cIn the Name of God\u201d ",
