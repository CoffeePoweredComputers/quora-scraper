            "answer_text": "I would imagine there are two reasons: one, the vast homeless population, and two, the fact that policies of the city have been homeless-friendly to the point of talking about \u201cexcusing\u201d shoplifting based on the fact that people need things, and if they don\u2019t have money, then they just have to take them. Yes, that\u2019s really what has been talked about. So clearly, this is becoming a very unfriendly town to your average retailer. What with the lockdown restrictions piled on top of the city\u2019s leniency toward the homeless and vagrant population, it would have to be pure hell to be a retailer in the SF area right about now. So, they\u2019re leaving. I probably would too. ",
