            "answer_text": "As a beginner I would suggest you the children's classics by Satyajit Ray (Indian Bengali filmmaker)-. Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne (1969) and Heerak Rajar Deshe (1980), the latter being a personal favorite. Every Bengali I know probably started watching movies with them. I found most of them on YouTube, so don't worry about availability.       Followed by the Ray's Detective pieces- The two Feluda movies and the one with Uttam Kumar as Byomkesh Bakshi. Joi Baba Felunath (1979)   Sonar Kella (1974)   Chiriyakhana (1967)   For more mature content, you should definitely check out the The Apu Trilogy as User has mentioned, Charulata (1964), Devi (1960) , Aranyer Din Ratri (1970) and Agantuk (1991). You would find the cinematography of these movies is comparable if not better than many recent commercial Bollywood movies, specially of Charulata (Ray himself admitted in an interview that it is the one with least number of flaws among his films). The only complain you may have is the low pace which is almost Ray's signature. But, once you make peace with the pace, you'll find them to be remarkably revelating.        Among the recent movies apart from the ones already mentioned in other answers , Bhooter Bhabishyat (2012), Autograph (2010), Phoring (2013) ,The Endless Wait (2009), are definitely worth watching.

I'd do the same and for that precise reason, will keep it out from my list as it's already the most recommended suggestion. That's a staple diet for anybody intersted in Bengali cinema :-) I'll recommend some relatively recent ones, in no particular order: Herbert (2006)Shubho Mahurat (2003)Dahan (1998)The Clay Bird (2002)Phoring (2013)House of Memories (2000)36 Chowringhee Lane (1981)Bakita Byaktigato (2013)Shabdo (2013)Apur Panchali (2014)A Short Story (2014)Shob Charitro Kalponik (2009)The Lady of the House (2000)Teen Yaari Katha (2012)Labour of Love (2014)I'm tempted to put in Bhooter Bhabishyat (2012) but it's quite difficult to get this film in its entirety without being aware of the multiple Bengali subtexts that layer the film.",
