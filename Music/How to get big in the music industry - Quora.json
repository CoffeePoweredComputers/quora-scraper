            "answer_text": "You know, it is actually easier than you think, but you may have to do stuff that you dont want to do. The entertainment business is a continuous power play between producers, shareholders and entertainers. As an entertainer you have to appease everyone, not just the audience. Most of the time its being there at the right time and place. and then being willing to do the gig. It could start simply by doing some small time tracks for someone else in the studio. Maybe they want you to sing an example of how you think a song should be, and then the real vocalist will take over. you get a few dollars and none of the credit. But eventually you will end up getting in with a crowed who are all trying to rise to the top and you will have a better chance than you did before. Its all about hard work, dedication and not causing any problems. over the last 20 years, talent has been steadily coming in second to all this. but it certainly stands out if you have it. Play the local scene, meet people and develop relationships to build from. the more your name gets around the more the higher-ups are willing to listen to you. And do your best not to re-invent the wheel. you need fresh new material all the time. The more time you dedicating to writing new songs, the better. ",
