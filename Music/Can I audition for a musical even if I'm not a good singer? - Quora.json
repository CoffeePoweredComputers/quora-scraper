            "answer_text": "YES! Look at some of the character actors in musicals, usually the \u201cfriend\u201d of the star or some other fairly substantial role but is very comedic. Ado Annie in Oklahoma is an example. The stepsisters in Cinderella are another. Just know what you are trying out FOR and sing an appropriate song for the role (not from the musical you are auditioning for, but similar in range). These are parts that require great acting skills and usually a medium amount of vocal chops. ",

( They just humiliate you in front of everybody else! ) \u201cYou just pick your self up, dust your self off and start all over again\"! I think most \u201cBroadway\u201d actors stink as singers! Who knows, you might make it big! ( If not after multiple rejections you might think about getting some lessons? Just a thought. ) ",

My long experience in music education has confirmed my belief that everyone can sing. You may not Met Opera or Broadway material, but you can sing! Any music experience you can gain by being in a musical will only benefit your voice. On the other hand, If, indeed, you cannot sing there are many ways to participate in a stage production without singing. I would strongly encourage you to audition or express an interest in working on the tech end of the production. Good luck to you . . . er . . . BREAK A LEG! ",

However, I would say that in the last 10 years or so it\u2019s begun to be much more difficult for those who can\u2019t sing or dance to get cast in musicals. It used to be the case that for \u201ccharacter\u201d parts, acting ability was more important - you could \u201cact\u201d your way through a song in character. The character was more important than the song. That is less the case now. More and more, producers want trained singers and dancers. That doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t audition - being challenged is good for you, and any audition is an opportunity to do your job. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure. As long as you're not trying for a role that requires a singer play it, being able to sing clearly with good pitch and adequate volume should be enough. As someone else has said, there are often non-singing roles. But unless you're thinking of auditioning for a professional show, a good clear voice that can carry a tune should be fine for chorus. If you're worried at all, you could go for a couple of voice lessons just to have a good ear listen and offer suggestions. Good luck! ",
