            "answer_text": "F major has only one flat, and that flat is Bb. With this scale we can build 7 modes which all sound different but use the same notes. For example, if we use the notes of F major, but start and end on the note D, we end up playing a D minor scale. D minor is the relative minor of F Major. Think of it as a set of rules for which notes are allowed. We can do this starting and ending on any two notes that are available in that scale. For example: F-F is F Major (or F Ionian) = F G A Bb C D E F G-G is G Dorian = G A Bb C D E F G (notice how it\u2019s the same notes as F major) A-A is A Phrygian Bb-Bb is Bb Lydian C-C is C Mixolydian D-D is D Minor (or D Aeolian) E-E is E Locrian ",
