            "answer_text": "I personally like Eddie\u2019s playing, tone, and songwriting, way better than Steve. However, Steve has better technical chops, along with being a better educated musician. Steve attended Berklee college of music in Boston, and one of the first things he did after was join Frank Zappa\u2019s band which is no joke. You need to be able to read music charts up and down in Franks band with all of the quirkiness and musical odd times going on. My favorite work by Steve Vai is his 2 albums that he did with David Lee Roth. I think Dave, along with their producer Ted Templeman really got the best out of him, because most of his solo work doesn\u2019t come close to being that good or that rockin\u2019. One of the things that makes his work with Dave so good, is Dave and producer Ted Templeman brought the spirit of Van Halen with them to Dave\u2019s solo albums, and solo band to the point that they were more classic Van Halen than the then current incarnation of VH with Sammy Hagar. They wanted a guitarist who could give Eddie Van Halen a serious run for his money. They definitely achieved that with the 2 Dave solo albums that Steve\u2019s on. Steve came close and occasionally surpassed Eddie in overall greatness of music for those few years, but Eddie is by far my favorite of the 2 in overall musical work in the last 40 years. ",

            "answer_text": "I hate these \u201cwho's better\u201d questions when it comes to performing arts. All of our favorite guitar players have their specialties that they are known for. I think in regards to this question though, most would agree that Steve Vai is on a different level as a 'player'. I think he took the guitar pretty much as far as you can take it. Our earlier guitar God's like Jimi, Clapton, Beck, Page took the basics and pushed them as far as they could be pushed. Then guys like Eddie and Randy expanded on that with speed and scales. Once guys like Vai, Satriani, Yngwie, and George Lynch just to name a few came along, they took it even further. Vai I think might be the top dog. With his use of scales, modes, knowledge of music and the fretboard, his tone, control and command of the instrument, he has demonstrated from his days with Zappa that he his a true virtuoso in every sense of the word. Eddie? He's just a great guitar player, songwriter, and influential. But I think Vai, as a guiarist is on a different level. Just one wannabe\u2019s opinion. ",
