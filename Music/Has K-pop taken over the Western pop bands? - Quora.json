            "answer_text": "No, it has not taken over western pop bands. Has it become significantly popular? Yes. However, \u201ctaking over\u201d something that is super mainstream requires more than just popularity. Kpop is trendy right now, but are Kpop groups/artists household names? Are radio stations, restaurants, etc. playing their songs all the time? Kpop comes with an intense stan culture, so that means many Kpop fans are not just fans, they\u2019re stans. They devote a good chunk of their time to their favorite group/artist. Now add to that a high influx of Kpop stans. It\u2019s quite a deadly combo. For example, every day we see at least one twitter trend related to Kpop. It\u2019s not that everyone is tweeting about that topic; it\u2019s just that the same fans are tweeting about it multiple times, giving an illusion of the topic being an actual trend, when it is a trending topic only within the Kpop circle. Same goes for the inflated YouTube views on every Kpop MV, as a result of mass-streaming. We cannot consider these views organic (in other words, it has not been watched by a diverse population; the fandom is the one watching it over and over to increase views). As of now, I think BTS is the only Kpop group that has some recognition outside the Kpop circle, although I would not consider them \u201cmainstream\u201d or a household name (if you know what I mean). They have a lot of fans, but if we were to pull out the percentages, ratios, and stuff, I guess it would not be much in comparison to western artists who have been around for ages (still an achievement for BTS though). Will it take over western pop bands in the future? Most likely not. It might become slightly more popular in the next few years, or die down. Although Kpop is fun for those who\u2019re into it (cute idols, colorful MVs, great performances, catchy tunes), it\u2019s not very unique in my opinion (it\u2019s essentially pop music in Korean language). It appeals to a certain group of people, but I doubt it will become any bigger than this. Unlike traditional Korean music, which has its own unique sound, Kpop is pretty much like western pop music but with intense choreos. So even if people get past the language barrier, I doubt it will stand the test of time. Anyway as of now, barring a few casual fans, Kpop stans are generally very active (and intense) on social media and make their presence known. But that\u2019s about it. ",

            "answer_text": "Well Little Mix is still going strong in the UK and parts of Europe! But I understand what you\u2019re asking. The K-pop groups do a lot of similar things - though some key elements are different - and appeal to similar demographics, and right now there\u2019s more activity around them in North America than their western counterparts. Still I would not say they \u201ctook over\u201d because they entered a relatively empty market. One Direction and Fifth Harmony went on hiatus years before BTS, Blackpink and friends really started surging here and they were not really replaced. I do wonder how the K-pop groups would have fared if that didn\u2019t happen. Anecdotally a decent chunk of the US BTS fanbase seems to be Directioners who wanted a big active group to stan. I\u2019m curious to see where it all goes in the future. US popular music has moved heavily towards hip-hop and an indie/DIY vibe and groups like BROCKHAMPTON that are farther from the K-pop group lane are what has been hot the last few years. The major labels are eyeing the success the K-pop groups have had though, and have debuted boy groups like PRETTYMUCH, Why Don\u2019t We, and In Real Life and girl groups like Four of Diamonds. These groups haven\u2019t gotten all that much traction yet, but they\u2019re still being well supported, and if they don\u2019t take off I\u2019m sure the labels will try again. If K-pop keeps surging, they might even start trying collaborative projects with K-pop companies. Produce 101 USA? It\u2019s more likely than you think. ",

            "answer_text": "I personally think K-pop is a completely different genre. The music, concept and choreography is very different than that of the western pop bands. Although the recent hype around it has made it , become mainstream , but I think K-pop has always had a distinct culture to it, that makes it quite distinguishable. I don\u2019t think a particular music culture can take over some other culture, since, they cannot be compared. Bands like Maroon 5 , 1 Direction and 5 seconds of Summer are still very relevant and popular around the world.The rising popularity of K-pop bands , might have taken a hit on these bands , but that would not be treated as taking over someone\u2019s position.The music industry all over the world, has enough space for all kinds of music and so do the audience. Hope this helps :) ",

You see Korean is a non phonetic language and the only language that I have wanted to learn and have never been able to. If more kpop was in English or even Spanish then it could have become much bigger than it is currently, but alas it has become stagnant as far as I know. e ",
