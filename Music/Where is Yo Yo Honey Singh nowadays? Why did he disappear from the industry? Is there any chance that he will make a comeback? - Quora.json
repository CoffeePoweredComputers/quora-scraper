            "answer_text": "Yeah, no one even noticed that today is honey Singh' birthday, happy 35th birthday yo yo. Coming to the question where was he since last year? After watching this image people say that see what he has become after success. His last hit album was dheere dheere in 2015,and he appeared in movie Zorawar in 2016 which was obviously flop.Rumours were that honey Singh could not digest success and like others he was star of few days but why?He answered that question that he was taking treatment of bipolar mood disorder- it is psychological illness in which patients develops maniac(hyper excitability) and depressed episodes\u200b. Because of which he started taking excessive alcohol and he had to take treatment for the same. He changed 4 doctors for his illness and took treatment for 18 months.He was known for his rap but his work perceived his image as vulgar and violent and few FIR and PIL are also admitted against him because of controversies of song balatkari.And about his come back I would say that this is industry and they just need someone in other's place and Badshah and Raftaar are doing best in absence of honey Singh.so, it is not impossible to come back but hard enough according to his current status but he can if he comes up with something new and special ( I don't know what special he has done till date except lungi dance and Angrezi beat).So let's see what happens.
