            "answer_text": "As someone who\u2019s watched up to like 40-something minutes of the third episode, I think I\u2019m qualified enough to answer this? However, once I finish it I\u2019ll edit this answer and let you know if I\u2019ve changed my stance or not. Anyways, as for answering the question, I don\u2019t get any weird vibes from them. At one point I got weird vibes from Jay and Hyesung but yeah. I think K is pretty nice and actually understands the teamwork concept. I think Seon is kind of exclusive to some of the contestants but not because he\u2019s trying to be mean or doesn\u2019t like them but I think he just has some people he prefers to stick with. ",
