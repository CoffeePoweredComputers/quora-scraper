            "answer_text": "The specific reason is that the recording engineer wants them to\u2026 because it is \u201cartistically pleasing\u201d. Most musical instruments don\u2019t actually have a volume control\u2026 so they sound different when played more quietly\u2026 and you cannot simply play them more and more quietly until the sound stops. In some musical compositions, the music itself does get gradually quieter, because the score calls for the individual instruments to be played that way, or because the piece has various instruments drop out at different times. In most recordings, the fade is simply applied by the engineer who does the mixing turning the volume control gradually down to zero at the end\u2026 and a lot of mixing consoles and software have a feature that will do so smoothly and automatically when you select it. When you\u2019re specifically talking about live recordings, done in front of live audiences, the audience will often continue to clap for a long time, and nobody really wants to listen to a recording that contains several minutes of audience clapping between each song. There are also several reasons why you would want a quiet gap between songs (basically so each song has \u201ca beginning\u201d and \u201can end\u201d\u2026 and you don\u2019t have \u201cone big block of music\u201d). Therefore, in live recordings, it is common to apply a \u201cfade in\u201d before the music starts, and a \u201cfade out\u201d after the music stops, individually for each \u201crack\u201d or \u201csong\u201d\u2026 the basic reason to do gradual fades is simply that abrupt stops and starts sound odd and interrupt the flow of the listening experience.

            "answer_text": "Recorded songs don\u2019t all fade out at the end. Many of them just end. The fade is there to give the audio impression of the song going on forever. Or, more practically, because the musicians couldn\u2019t think of a good ending. Live music ends because when you\u2019re playing music, well, you have to stop playing at some point, and it\u2019s good to do so in a clear way, so as to cue the audience\u2019s reaction. However, I have known improvisations to fade into silence. In fact, in free improvisation, it\u2019s almost the default setting, especially when at least one of the improvisers is less than skilled; it just gets quieter and quieter and more and more people drop out, until it becomes apparent that the music is over. However, if you can an end a free improvisation on a sharp, decisive note, that\u2019s often considered a good thing. This usually only happens when players are really listening to and communicating with each other, though, which happens less often than you might think. ",
