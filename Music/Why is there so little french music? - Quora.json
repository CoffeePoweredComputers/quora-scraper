            "answer_text": "It\u2019s like you\u2019re asking why is there so few people who speak French. You need to have a base to compare it to. Comparing French music to English, of course. Because English is a lot more popular than French. English speaking countries (The U.S, U.K, Australia, NZ, etc\u2026) are a lot more popular than French speaking countries (France, part of Canada, some other countries in Africa that I don\u2019t know for certain). Even music bands in non-English-speaking countries prefer to write songs in English so that they can boost their popularity. Meanwhile, only artists in France and some in Canada would compose French music. Last but not least, music is about taste, not quantity and that\u2019s not something we can compare. ",

There are also brilliant classic French musicians & music: The classic folk song \u00c0 La Claire Fontaine; the brilliant artist Charles Trenet. Edith Pilaf. Jacques Brel. If if you think there\u2019s a lack of good French music, you simply haven't been looking hard enough. ",
