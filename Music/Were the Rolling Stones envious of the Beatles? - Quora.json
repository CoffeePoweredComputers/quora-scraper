            "answer_text": "I think it went both ways. The Stones were definitely envious of the Beatles in the early days, but by the time of Let it Be, there was envy at least on Lennon's part as evinced by Dig a Pony. At least that's how it sounds to me. Otherwise, why mention them at all. When the Beatles were coming apart , the Stones were just reaching their full potential. I think Lennon must have been fully aware of that, and that it provoked some jealousy. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that there was definitely a rivalry, probably friendly, in the sixties, culminating with The Stones album \u201cHer Satanic Majesty\u2019s Request.\u201d That album was unlike anything The Stones had done before or has since, and was their response to \u201cSgt. Peppers.\u201d They were the top two British Bands of the time of the British Invasion, despite some rumblings from \u201cThe Who;\u201d with The Stones being marketed, and aligned with the darker side and a Blues background, and The Beatles in the opposite corner, being more upbeat, and pop driven.
