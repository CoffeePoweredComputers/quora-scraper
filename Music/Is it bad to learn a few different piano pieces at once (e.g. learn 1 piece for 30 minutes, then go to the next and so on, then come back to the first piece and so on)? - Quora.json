            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad if you\u2019re enjoying yourself and you find this way of playing fulfilling. I guess it depends on your aim as a player. If you want to really master a piece to a professional performance standard, you really need sustained focus on one piece for a long time. And there\u2019s a sense in which the longer you concentrate on one thing, the more likely you are to improve it. If you chop and change between pieces, there\u2019s a danger that you stop practising at precisely the spot at which the work is becoming difficult - because it\u2019s easier to start doing something else or switch to another piece than it is to dig deeper into the problems that present themselves from examining the details of the piece you\u2019re working on. But like I say, are you happy working this way? Are you achieving what you want? Then it\u2019s fine. ",

            "answer_text": "I offer my answer not in order to give a general rule, but rather to encourage some people of my own age (68 years now). Since 3 years ago, when I went to retirement, I practice piano for around 3 hours each day, in chunks of 45 minutes. After 45 minutes I am totally exhausted and have to rest for one hour. I have a goal to play all Beethoven sonatas in public and until now I have coped with 16 sonatas. (Some difficult ones, but the most difficult ones are still missing.)Sometimes I play other pieces for my own amusement but I was not really practising them until 6 months ago. At that time I found incidentally a piano teacher who is really doing me good. (Pianist and composer) So now I am practicing several pieces at the same time: Beethoven, Bach, Brahms, Schubert. and some smaller compositions for add-ons. It is very useful for getting general ability and command over your hands. I also play scales and Chopin for exercises. Therefore my example may not serve everybody but I can assure you that it keeps me very much alive and the recitals are rewarding. ",
