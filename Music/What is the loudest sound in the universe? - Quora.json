            "answer_text": "An old coworker of mine had a sportbike of some sort with no muffler at all, and was showing it off doing some revving to 12,000 rpm in the parking lot. It was a lot louder than I expected and it hurt my ears without covering them. I\u2019ve also been around lots of different types of gunfire. An AR-15 with a really good muzzle brake generates a ton of concussion to the sides and behind the shooter. A deer rifle is louder but the blast is mostly directed away. The loudest gun I\u2019ve ever come across was a Mosin Nagant with its barrel cut down to just 17 inches. It generated huge fireballs and was loud enough to feel the noise hit your teeth, which no other gun had done to me before. I\u2019ve blown up binary exploding targets up to two pounds at once which weren\u2019t as loud. The loudest thing I\u2019ve ever experienced however was not a gun, but was two heavily modified pickup trucks racing inside a tunnel. I was following them on the highway in my miata with the top down, and all three of us slowed down to about 40 and entered the tunnel at the same time. The two trucks ahead of me went pedal-down and the noise level was hard to describe. It went from loud, to \u201cfuzzy\u201d sounding, to feeling it in your chest, to feeling it in your teeth like the 17\u2033 Nagant, to a new strange feeling, a tingly sensation on any exposed skin. Arms, fingers, and face all felt like when you sit wrong for an hour and your foot falls asleep. But as soon as the trucks let off, and the noise subsided, the feeling was gone. I don\u2019t know what kind of trucks they were other than huge newer pickups. They were debadged and back then I didn\u2019t know as much about trucks as I do now. I don\u2019t recall ever smelling any diesel exhaust or seeing smoke, so I\u2019m inclined to believe they were running some sort of giant turbo or supercharged gasoline engines. In any case they both were lifted super cabs and both were way faster than my car. Edit: Since initially writing this I\u2019ve experienced another extremely loud thing: jet fighters at an airshow. This was specifically a pair of F16\u2019s doing a full afterburner takeoff and vertical climb. I also saw F35\u2019s but the F16\u2019s were a bit louder. They make a spectacular amount of noise especially given the considerable distance between the planes and the spectators. But at that viewing distance they still weren\u2019t as loud as those two pickups in the tunnel. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, everyone is going to say there is no sound in space because sound waves need air or gas or water or some medium to conduct the waves . But if you mean shock waves, the largest would have been the Big Bang itself. Next would be the collision or \u2018merger \u2018 of two Supermassive Black Holes which are said to release their energy ( a small percentage of their total mass ) in gravitational waves - a huge ripple in space itself moving at the speed of light but net speed slightly faster because it is bending space as it moves ) . Next would probably be the Supernovae of the early stars which were probably very large and short lived . Then, Supernovae of the largest stars of \u2018modern era \u2018 up to 250 to 300 times the mass of the Sun. And Kilonovae ( Kilonovas ) resulting from two Neutron Stars orbiting each other and eventually colliding might beat many Supernovae in shock wave . Then other things as we go far far far lower on the list like the Volcano Krakatoa and 4th of July Fireworks haha\u2026. Loudest sounds the Earth has experienced since complex \u2018Life \u2018 existed were probably the KT Meteorite Impact which wiped out the Dinosaurs and the Krakatoa Volcano Eruption . Did I miss any other large ones on modern Earth ? Czar Bomba (Russian 55 megaton Nuclear Bomb )\u2026 I prefaced the Answer with the obvious lack of sound due to nothing to conduct sound across space but there are shock waves and of course there is enough gas and particles around Stars very close ",
