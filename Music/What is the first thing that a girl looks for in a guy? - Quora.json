It says LOOKS FOR. Time to put in a technically-correct snarky answer from an unexpected direction then. ANSWER: If the girl isn\u2019t blind, then obviously the first thing she LOOKS for is LOOKS! Because if you\u2019re LOOKING for something you have to be able to SEE it! \u2026Huh, that\u2019s NOT actually me being too literal. Interesting. Well, aesthetics are serious business, more so today than ever before considering online dating is all about swiping on photos. If a woman feels like she has more than a few thousand choices, she\u2019s not going to pay attention outside the top ten or so. Put a bunch of girls together with different preferences and you\u2019ll get maybe the top 100 men covered out of a few thousand. The days of actually getting to know someone as friends and then deciding \u201cI\u2019d like to spend my life (or at least a lot of it) with this person\u201d based on an informed decision are gone. Instead, we have endless chasing of butterflies, fear of missing out, and obsession with always aiming for something better. Fortunately, this means all the rest of us men can reorient our life goals and, if we are capable enough, aim for self-actualization instead of being tied down fulfilling the more basic needs of a family. Women are much more prolific consumers than men, so by keeping men single, this reduces the amount of income which can be spent on consumption (so long as the millions of men living alone keep away from OnlyFans or the likes). we\u2019ll also pollute the environment less. Isn\u2019t it wonderful? EDIT: Obviously there are plenty of exceptions, but it only takes a few percentage points to help protect the environment better. And modern \u201crelationships\u201d already have over 40% meeting online, so\u2026 Tinder is helping save the planet. EDIT 2: In case it\u2019s not obvious, if the question was \u201cwhat do women want in/from men\u201d I\u2019d leave it be because everyone else answered well enough. I\u2019d say reliability, honesty, industriousness, diligence, not being an idiot with money, and enough looks to not be embarrassing to be seen with according to society. ",

            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t answer for all women, but this is a basic (what I look for) standard: Kind - if the first impression I have of you isn\u2019t kind or respectful, you probably don\u2019t have a good chance with me.Trustworthy - if I\u2019ve seen you in a relationship where you\u2019re cheating, the relationship probably won't start off very trusting (or start at all).Equal - in a relationship, no one should make all the decisions (in my opinion) i.e., you buy the movie tickets, I\u2019ll buy the concession snacks, etc.Intelligent (this may be just me) - Do I have to explain this one?Willing to put in the work - I want you to \u201ctry\u201d in the relationship. if you aren\u2019t feeling it, just tell me, don\u2019t drag it out.Communicative - TALK TO ME. If you don\u2019t want to talk or are unavailable at the moment, don\u2019t leave me on read, just tell me you can\u2019t talk at the moment (respectfully)Confidant (in the relationship) - don\u2019t get jealous if a guy starts talking to me in front of you, I can take care of myself, and if I need help, i\u2019ll tell you.Good Listener - I\u2019ll do the same, just be someone I can talk toSense of Humor - I can laugh at almost anything with someone I enjoy being around, just don\u2019t be offensive and it\u2019s fineGenuinely caring - WANTS to spend time with me and my family, and considers them family. Also just cares for peoples well being (not right away necessarily, but idk\u2026)If anyone gets butthurt over this for some reason, I\u2019m sorry. But these shouldn\u2019t be difficult expectations. Anyone who is a decent human would have at least 9/10 of these. Be a good person, and don\u2019t treat your S/O like shit. (I guess that\u2019s \u2190 what I look for in a guy) ",
