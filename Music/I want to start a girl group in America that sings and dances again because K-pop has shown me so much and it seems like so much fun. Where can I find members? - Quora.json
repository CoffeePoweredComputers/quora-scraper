You could probably get the biggest following and the largest amount of people to try out by promoting it throughout social media. I would recommend maybe getting a separate email and different accounts for this new group you would start.Locally. You never know who around you would be into k-pop, you could put flyers up or around your town promoting auditions.Calling around. You could call around for some of your friends and look for members that way. Start by asking your friends or even asking them if they know anyone that is talented in singing/dancing/rapping then go off from there.Goodluck ! ",
