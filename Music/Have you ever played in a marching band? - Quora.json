            "answer_text": "Growing up, we had a piano in the house, and like many kids, I took piano lessons as a young boy but never really pursued it. But at least I learned to read music. In 9th grade, the band director came up to me in study hall one day and asked if I would be interested in joining the junior high band. Apparently they were short on trombone players, and needed another chair. I had never played a brass instrument, so of course this also entailed me taking music lessons, from the same band director (small school). I eventually got good enough to play in the band and in public concerts. In my sophomore year in high school, a boy a year younger than myself joined the band. He was way better than me. and I got bumped from the trombone section, being last chair. I was introduced to a new instrument \u2014 the sousaphone, a type of tuba.  More lessons. The school had two kinds of sousaphones \u2014 one made of brass, which I played in concert band and pep band for basketball games, and (thankfully) a lighter one made of fiberglass, which I played in marching band. Not entirely fiberglass though, the valves and mouthpiece were still brass. All of this was taking place in a small town in Iowa. Playing in marching band meant playing at half-time for football games, in weather that was often near freezing near the end of the season. It would be so cold your lips could stick to the metal like the flagpole scene in \u201cA Christmas Story\u201d. So like other students playing instruments that had removable mouthpieces, I would take the mouthpiece and put in under the armpit of my jacket to keep it warm while not playing. Our biggest event was when we were invited to march down Michigan Avenue in Chicago for a holiday. This was back when there was still a daily passenger train between our small town in Iowa and Chicago. The band took up an entire coach, and we rode all night, getting on at 10 pm and arriving around 7 in the morning. We marched right past the Art Institute with its two lion statues. We stayed overnight downtown at the Drake Hotel, now a landmark. ",

            "answer_text": "I've been in 3 marching bands. In high school\u2026shortly after in a college-affiliated band, and the recruit drum and bugle corps in bootcamp. I played trumpet in the first two and mellophone in the last. At least I think they called it a mellophone\u2026they had too many trumpets and asked for some to swap\u2026so I did. ",
