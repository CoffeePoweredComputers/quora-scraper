            "answer_text": "Once you've downloaded the songs you wish to listen to offline, you can enable Offline mode by navigating to your settings, which is found on the left-hand menu. Toggle 'Offline' at the top of the settings menu and you'll then be able to listen to your downloaded songs no matter if you're connected to the internet or not. To see your discography, tap \u201cYour Library\u201d on the bottom tray of options.To sort your music by albums that you have downloaded to your device, click the \u201cAlbums\u201d tab, then swipe down to reveal a search bar. Next to that bar is a button that says \u201cFilters.\u201d Click that, then filter by \u201cDownloads.\u201d To find individual songs, which used to be conveniently nested within \u201cYour Library\u201d in a tab called \u201cSongs,\u201d you\u2019ll now need to follow several steps. First, click the \u201cPlaylists\u201d tab. Once you\u2019re there, go to the \u201cLiked Songs\u201d playlist, where all of your downloaded songs live. (All the songs that you\u2019ve downloaded are automatically \u201cliked,\u201d so it makes some sort of sense that this is where they\u2019d be found, but it\u2019s still confusing.)Once you\u2019re in the \u201cLiked Songs\u201d playlist, click the menu button near the top right of the screen to reveal some settings. Click \u201cFilter downloaded songs\u201d to only show the songs you have downloaded. Even if you turn on Spotify\u2019s \u201cOffline mode\u201d in the app settings, you\u2019ll still need to sort your music by downloads, otherwise it will display a bunch of unplayable songs.You can try an alternative way to download music from Spotify, and you can customize the output path that you want to save the downloaded Spotify music.
