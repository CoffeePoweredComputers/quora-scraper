I will list some of the most common, and a few weirdos: http://Archive.orghttp://Bandcamp.com --- TOP RECOMMENDATIONhttp://FreeMusicArchive.orghttp://Last.fmhttp://NoiseTrade.comhttp://PureVolume.comhttp://ReverbNation.comhttp://Soundcloud.com It is very, very easy to Google for more websites and for what bands are out there putting their hard work online for your enjoyment. Keep in mind that free music is most often found by non-commercial bands, and non-commercial bands most usually play non-commercial styles.  If you are just looking for \"new popular song/album X\", you might be wasting your time trying to search free archives for that kind of thing. In addition to catch-all website, there are a ton of netlabels (online music labels) that offer entire catalogues of releases for free download, including digital-only and multi-format releases.  I did not put any there because they are genre-specific, even if they span multiple kinds of music. Also, get into bands that offer entire free previews and entire albums on public hosting websites like Mediafire and 4shared.  If your music is costing you a lot of money for digital formats (which don't have the same manufacturing overhead as vinyl, for example), you are most probably being ripped off.  A person could easily live entirely on music that artists and labels offer for free. ",
