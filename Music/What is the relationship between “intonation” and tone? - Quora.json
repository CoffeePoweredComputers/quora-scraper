            "answer_text": "In music, the medium is sound, and physics tells us that sound has 4 components: pitch, intensity, duration, and timbre. Intonation refers to pitch, tone to timbre. The pitch of a sound is the measurment of how fast the air is vibrating. In western music we use standardized pitches, and we name them using letters. By international agreement in the early 20th century, the note A above middle C is 440 Hz (Hertz, the international measurement of vibrations per second). \u201cIntonation\u201d usually means whether musicians are playing in tune or not\u2014if in an ensemble, is everyone playing 440 Hz fopr A aabove middle C, and are all the other notes in the proper mathematical ratio (an octave interval, for example, has the higher pitch vibrating exactly twice as fast as the lower one\u2014so that the A an octave above A = 440 will bbe at 880). It also might refer to a musician whose instrument is not in tune with itself\u2014the guitarist whose G string is a bit low, or the singer who the judges on \u201cThe Voice\u201d say is \u201cpitchy\u201d. Tone, or timbre, or tone color, is the distinctive mix of overtones that gives an instrument a distinctive sound. Flutes sound like other flutes becaause their overtones are rather soft, oboes sound so rich and sensyous because their overtones are rather prominent. Overall, the tone of an instrument (played in traditiional ways) will be recognizable no matter what its intonation is. ",

            "answer_text": "Each discipline has its own usages, so since I got this in a language space I'll give you a linguistic answer. Tone refers to the distinctive use of pitch to change meaning. Yoruba has three tones, called low, mid, and high. The syllable wa with low tone means \u201cexist in a place,\u201d with mid it means \u201c our/us, \u201c and with high it means \u201ccome.\u201d There are many such sets. Tone does not mean pitch. It's pitch relative to the tones around it and to the pitch range of the speaker. Intonation refers to how pitch contours are used in phrases and sentences to show meaning, like question intonation vs. declarative intonation. These are strictly linguistic definitions. ",
