            "answer_text": "If you want to know why Trump is going to be impeached with only Democrat support. Follow the money. When he drains the swamp, he removes the ways that Dems and some Republicans get rich while they are in office. Biden and son are just one small example. So Trump, who needs no money, becomes prez and already knows where the money is coming from in most cases. Its our foreign aid programs. Our tax dollars go to corrupt nations who return much of it in whatever format works to the politicians who send it to them. Meanwhile their country gets nothing and the leaders get 50% or so and Biden or some other American politician or the Democrat party itself is given millions in - used to be- before Trump-untraceable kick backs.Trump has spilled the beans regarding the big honey pot used by each party in an effort to save taxpayers money and of course make him a hero.It probably seemed like a good plan once he was prez. I guaranfreakintee you that the Dems see impeachment as something they will blame on the soon to be gone far left wing of their party and every politician up there wants things to go back to those good old honey pot days. Cats out of the bag though so they are all scrambling behind the scenes trying to find a what they hope will be high ground after what they hope is a short high tide. What they obviously do nort want to see is the American public wising up to the real truth. The next election could be very very interesting. impeachment or not. ",

Everyone knows of Bill and Hillary charging copious amounts to speak at various banks. The two have earned an estimated total of $153 million from 729 different speeches averaging $210,795 for each one. It's also said that President George W. Bush has earned $15 million for speeches charging an average of $100,000\u2013175,000 per. Secondly is books. Most notable, President Obama has gotten around $2.5 million from book royalties. Also, Hillary Clinton is has received $5 million in book royalties. Although, there's not tons of ways to get rich while in office. Play your cards right, and you'll be a millionaire in no time when you get out. Sources: $153 million in Bill and Hillary Clinton speaking fees, documented On talk circuit, George W.

You want less money in politics? You\u2019ll never accomplish that through legislation. You have to reduce the scope of the Federal government to a point to where the economic returns don\u2019t justify the investment in influence. Devolve power to the states, away from the Federal government. Switzerland has 26 cantons. Their central government is very weak, with limited power. The real power rests in the cantons. Because of this, special interest group lobbying is virtually non-existent in Switzerland. It simply isn\u2019t economically feasible. As a result, politics there is local. This is how these United States were supposed to operate. ",
