            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not so much how many octaves, etc. It\u2019s more of a range thing. Tuning is specific to strings; we do not adjust open string tunings as guitarists do [i.e. - there\u2019s no \u2018drop D\u2019 or \u2018Open A\u2019 or \u2018Ostrich tuning\u2019 in string playing] Viola notes ranges from C, the lowest open string, to A, way up on the A string. [This varies according to how high a player\u2019s fingers can reach and still sound good.] Viola can be played within a 4 octave range and even higher notes can be played as fingered harmonics. ",
