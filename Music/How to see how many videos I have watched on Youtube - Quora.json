I\u2019d love to know personally, but it\u2019s not possible. Edit, 8th September 2018: This may not answer your question, and this is hella late, but Youtube (at least on Android) just added a feature where you can see how many hours you've watched Youtube, with timeframes going back to a week. You can't see how many videos, but it's still neat. ",

It is recorded in the \u2018watch history\u2019 section of the history tab located at the bottom of the channel page. This history will be available for the videos which you watched when you were logged into your YouTube account. You can also access your past videos from the browser history tab. If more than one user has access to YouTube on same PC, then this might be a problem because the browser would overlap information from different accounts and be unable to differentiate the history of one user from another, unless they sign in strictly from their respective accounts.
