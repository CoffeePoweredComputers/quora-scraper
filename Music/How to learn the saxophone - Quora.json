            "answer_text": "I'm a relatively new saxophonist, but I learned from a combination of YouTube, a really helpful beginner\u2019s book, and just messing around with it. \u201cWhat does this key do? What sound does it make when I press the metal thing? Do I have to use all these buttons?\u201d are questions I asked myself. The saxophone is an intricate, delicate piece of metal and leather that demands many specificities of both you and the instrument. I won't go into too much detail about teaching the instrument to you, but I know what can: \u2022YouTube: There\u2019s hundreds of free videos you can watch demonstrating the basics of the saxophone, and they really helped me. \u2022Books: Music books, like the weird \u201cStandard of Excellence\u201d ones that are $15 on Amazon are a great deal of help reading music and identifying notes. They also go lightly into fingering, which is very weird getting used to with this instrument. \u2022Yourself: Just purely looking at the instrument, feeling around with how it works and getting comfortable with it really helps you start off. Adjusting the neck strap or moving the reed a little or tightening/loosening the ligature gets you to know how the saxophone works and how you can make it make noise. Lastly, if you're just starting out, don't make a purchase until you know you are willing to invest your time and money. These things are moderately expensive once you go up in the ranks. I own a Mendini alto saxophone I got from Amazon and it is of pretty good quality for the $200 I paid for it. Those Yamaha professional-grade ones go into $600 or even $700. So, I hope that helped. Trust me, the saxophone is a really cool noise maker. If you're dedicated into learning it, just make sure that you start out slow, then work your way up in difficulty. ",

            "answer_text": "My #1 tip: Join sax forums. I'm a 13 year old student, who can outplay some high schoolers, without a single lesson. Experiment. I join SOTW, and my sax playing became much better, in a couple days. Get a GOOD SAX, good reeds, a decent mp, and play. A lot. A bundy 1 or 2 for a really cheap person, and a vintage sax if you can afford it. They are around a grand, for a Buescher big B, or something similar. A box of Rico royals, or vandoran, or something similar. Get somethin, like 2.5 hardness, and a decent mp, like a Yamaha 4c. Play all you can, get a book, and do all you can. Happy sax playin! ",
