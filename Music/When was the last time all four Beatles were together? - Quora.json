            "answer_text": "The Beatles finished Abbey Road on August 20, 1969. That\u2019s the last time all 4 were in the studio together. August 22, 1969 was the last time all 4 gathered for a photo shoot. It was at Lennon\u2019s Tittenhurst Park estate. The last time all 4 were together is not known as of this date in 2019. Most historians say that it was between September 15\u201319, 1969 due to many business meetings at Apple. September 20, 1969 was the day that The Beatles signed the new royalty contract with Capitol Records negotiated by Beatles manager, Allen Klein. Harrison missed this meeting\u2026going to visit his sick mother. George signed later. This was also the day that John Lennon told the others that he was leaving The Beatles. McCartney & Klein told Lennon that telling the press his decision would be harmful for business. John agreed to keep the news quiet. P\u2026G\u2026& R would call each other during the fall & winter and wonder if John would change his mind. Around this time\u2026Paul started working on his first solo album,\u201dMcCartney\u201d. Upon the release Paul told the press that The Beatles were basically over on April 10, 1970. During the 1970\u2019s they would get together in 2\u2019s and 3\u2019s for recording on different Beatles solo albums and Lennon hung out with Paul & Ringo at his beach house in Santa Monica in March/April 1974. As far as we know..all 4 were together for the last time between Sept.15\u201319, 1969 at the Apple office in London. ",

            "answer_text": "There is some dispute about this. Their last day in the studio together was Aug. 20 1969, when they recorded overdubs for I Want You (She's So Heavy). On Aug. 22 they did a photo shoot at Lennon's home at Tittenhurst Park, their final group photos. Several later meetings where they discussed business and later their breakup did not have all of them in one place. A promotional film for Something was shot October-ish, but the members appear with their wives, never together. Some sessions for Let It Be were done in 1970, but Lennon did not participate. They met in twos and threes at various concerts and parties over the next decade, and all contributed to Ringo's 1973 album, but again never all at once. Even their final legal dissolution was done remotely. A few sources claim otherwise, but there is no definitive proof of all four ever assembling after that photo session on Aug. 22 1969. ",

You could stretch it and say November 23, 1995 as that's when the Anthology was done with Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Ritchie Starkey, and John Lennon appearing posthumously. Three flesh and blood Beatles with one in spirit. I like to feel that they were together for that.    ",

But actually August 22nd, 1969 was the final date as they posed for the photo shoot at Tittenhurst Park \u2014 which is the known date for the photo shoot. I believe the misconception that arises when people say August 20th is due to the fact that it was the last time they were all in the studio together. But August 22nd was the last known time they were all together, ever. ",

Its said Lennon and McCartney eventually made up and got back in touch shortly before Lennon was murdered in 1980. However, as a foursome, don't think they were ever all seen together since 1969. Paul, George and Ringo did get together to record the Beatles Anthology in the late 80s, early 90s, about 10 years after Lennon's death. ",
