If you mean you would like to edit digital audio on a computer from a voice recorder or something like that, a good choice is Audacity, which you can get for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux. You can get it here: Audacity\u00ae. It's free. If you mean can you do this on a mobile phone or tablet, then search for \u2018audio editor\u2019 on your App Store. ",
