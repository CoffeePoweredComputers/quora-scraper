            "answer_text": "It really depends on what you mean by individual song. If you mean digital download of a song like say Fake Love or Boy With Love, it would be around 0.99 cents? Or well that\u2019s the last price I remembered buying \u201cFake Love\u201d on iTunes. If you mean buying a physical CD (single) of each song, there isn\u2019t such thing as a physical CD with one song, AT LEAST NOT for BTS or any Kpop album. They release songs in bulks/albums. With that said if an album typically costs $18 to $24 (not including shipping) and assuming 80% of that price goes to all the physical goods in an album such as a photobook, CD, photocard, poster, and more extra goods. $24 \u00d7 80% = $19.20 $4.20 \u00f7 (number of songs in an album) = cost of each song. If say their latest album (Map of Persona) has 7 songs, and costs $20.58 in amazon, shipping not included we can find the actual cost of each song in this particular album as follows: The album has the following goods (or at least the one I had, had these): Folded posterPhotobookStandard random photocardFilm1 Large photo w/ a signature2 extra random photocard/lomo cardThe Notes Mini BookletCDFor an album with a lot of items, $20.58 is pretty cheap and worth it. If say we are being practical and in a perfect world were we allocate the percentage of cost based on how much each item was to manufacture, 80 or even 90% of the album cost goes to the physical goods itself (because I know you can get a cheap CD in stores for like $4 or $5, and all those goods should make it very expensive with printing and buying all those materials) the projected cost of those 7 songs is as follows: $20.58 \u00d7 90% = $18.52 \u2014 Album cost (song costs not included, assuming 90% of the album cost goes to the actual production of the album) 20.58 - 18.52 = 2.06 \u2014 7 songs 2.06 \u00f7 7 songs = 0.29 per song $0.29 per song!! When you think about it in this way the individual songs are pretty cheap, cheaper than normal, and unlike other albums this has more goods. Definitely worth buying a physical album. Now say because we live in an economy driven world and a more realistic cost per song is $0.99 (digitally in iTunes or wherever). If the latest album songs are 0.99 each: $0.99 \u00d7 7 songs = $6.93 is the total cost of 7 songs $20.58 - 6.93 = $13.65 $13.65 is the cost of all the other items in the album without the cost of each song) $13.65 \u00f7 $20.58 = 66.326 or 66% 66% of the album goes to the cost of making the physical album itself! Now to answer the question at hand, I suppose the individual songs, if you\u2019ll be buying them digitally, theres a high chance each song is at the standard price $0.99 to $1.99 (assuming you bought the individual songs in iTunes/Apple Music) If you\u2019re buying a physical copy/single. There isnt an individual song for purchase except the whole album. Following the math from above, we can assume that the cost of an individual song of this particular album would be $0.99 cents as a standard price in a US market, or around $0.29 if we are equally subtracting the cost of the total album from all the extra goods you pay for when buying their albums. Hope this helps! ",
