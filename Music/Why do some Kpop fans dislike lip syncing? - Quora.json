            "answer_text": "Not just fans, I think almost everyone hates lip syncing because you won\u2019t really feel the music when watching the artist doing it. When an artist has too much to do with their schedule then it is understandable that they do lip syncing once in a while, but doing it frequently will just make people especially fans to think that they are just either lazy or don\u2019t have the skill to sing which may mean that they don\u2019t deserve their acknowledgment.
