            "answer_text": "Assuming you have a straightforward pair of stereo speakers you should move them out of the corner of the room and put them on stands which put the tweeters at about the same height above the floor as your ears will be when listening. You should position the two speakers a few feet or even metres apart (further apart the further away you're going to be when listening - if you wear glasses the speakers should probably be between a third and a half of the way out from the centre of your vision to where the edge of your glasses are - works for me). The point halfway between the speakers should be close to the middle of a wall. The walls and flat reflective surfaces in your listening room should be covered by curtains or something else to deaden the sound of the room. If stereo effects aren't very impressive then your speakers are too close together. If there's a weird sort of hole in the middle then they're too far apart. Remember that your distance from the speakers when listening will influence where you want to put the speakers. Then you've got an important bit of kit called a graphic equaliser. Maybe there's one built in. Maybe you want to buy an expensive rack unit. You could just run it through your PC/Mac and do it that way. You need to use the graphic equaliser to reduce any frequencies your room resonates at. I'm sure there are YouTube videos of test tones to help you find the offending frequencies. If you're sitting pretty close to the speakers some people say you should \u201ctoe\u201d the speakers in towards each other a little so they are both pointing at you, or even a little in front of you. My thinking is that most people probably just put their speakers parallel with the wall (unless they're PC desktop speakers) so it makes sense to check my mixes on non-toed speakers. You may wish to tweak the graphic equaliser to taste if you think it sounds better with more bass or treble or both. That's cool but always try to cut the frequencies you don't want and then turn the volume up rather than directly boosting the bit you want more of. It's just less annoying to other people who might happen to have hearing which is particularly sensitive at the exact frequency you've boosted. That's the 2-speaker set up. Obviously you could add a subwoofer for some neighbour-waking bass. The only thing with them is make sure you get one which allows you to adjust the crossover frequency. You can put the subwoofer anywhere you want as bass frequencies aren't really directional to us humans. Putting it in a corner will probably get you the deepest, but least responsive effect from it. Trial and error to find the best place in your room. Test it at a normal listening level as we perceive bass and treble differently depending whether they are loud or quiet. You want the subwoofer to be noticeable but not louder than the main speakers. Doesn't need to be extremely loud as you'll get used to it whatever level you put it at. You need to adjust the crossover frequency which determines which frequencies are going to go to your stereo speakers and which will be handled by the subwoofer. things like rumbles, bass drums, bass guitars and general low pitched sounds should only be going to the sub so that the stereo speakers don't have the task of reproducing muddy low frequencies. There's nothing wrong with just setting this frequency to somewhere around about 100\u2013120 Hz but if your stereo speakers are so tiny, very very small, so small, not like American speakers, then you might want to push it up above 200 Hz to get some snare sounds into the sub. Personally I think a pair of stereo speakers which can reproduce true low frequencies sounds better than using a subwoofer but man there's a financial cost to speakers which can do that. I'm sure my brother-in-law's were 4 thousand each. Sounded amazing though. To make movies sound better you can add in surround speakers and a centre speaker but these tend to be sold as compete systems and then you're best to set it up however it says you're meant to. It'll probably come with a link to a video showing you how to do it. Normally there's lots of wires to hide. Surround sound can make your favourite music sound odd (such as the singer's reverb or random instruments jarringly jumping out into the surround speakers). If it was recorded using stereo monitors then that's probably the way it sounds best. Tl;dr: some of that might help but their position and your position is the most important thing, closely followed by EQ. Also\u2026 play good music through them of course. ",

            "answer_text": "You can considerably improve the performance, accuracy and spatial information delivery of any set of speakers with low cost construction materials. You invariably hear all kinds of reflections and resonances in an average room that conspire to muddy the audio and interfere with your music. Minimising these issues, paired with proper speaker placement, will significantly improve your listening environment and experience. This field is broadly known as \u201cRoom Acoustics\u201d. There are several \u201cproducts\u201d available that will help with this, although absorption panels and bass traps are relatively easy to construct yourself with mineral wool, some wood and hessian. It\u2019s important to mention that a completely reflectionless \u201cdead\u201d room is not a desirable trait. A little controlled liveliness and air can stop a room becoming too \u201coppressive\u201d, so it\u2019s an area where a little can go a long way. The best place to start is with some first reflection absorption and a little bit of bass trapping. The best website I\u2019ve found that goes into detail about room acoustics, with a few DIY designs is Arqen: Acoustic Design, Recording Studio Acoustics ",
