            "answer_text": "No. He was aware of Wagner, of course, but he actually didn't like what Wagner had done. Wagner professed to be telling the original legends, but he made a great many changes to them, which I think Tolkien regarded as distorting them. Tolkien invented something completely new that was inspired by the original legends. That gave him the freedom to do as he wished without changing the originals. Now that his version of the story of Kullervo from the Kalevala is about to be published, it will be interesting to see if the Finns feel as if he has done it justice. I can't quote chapter and verse, but I'm pretty sure I read about his attitude toward Wagner in a reputable biography. Maybe someone with access to better materials than I have can flesh it out. ",

In letter 229 to Allen and Unwin he responds to the notion that his Ring is derivative of Wagner's by stating, \"Both rings were round, and there the resemblance ceases.\" ",
