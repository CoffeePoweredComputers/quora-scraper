            "answer_text": "1.Youtube Ads YouTube pays him for making videos on YouTube or technically we can say that YouTube pays him money for putting ads on his videos . 2.Sponsors It is gold , you can make far more money from sponsors then you will make from YouTube videos. You just have to mention any product and give a small discription of it. That's it and the company will pay you a large money for that. 3.Affiliate I am not sure for this , as I am not watching his video for a long time . But in affiliate marketing , you just have to share affilaite links of products and then the companies pay you a small commission whenever anyone by anything (yes not only just that product but anything from that session link). I think that he also uses affilite links and makes a very good money through that. ",
