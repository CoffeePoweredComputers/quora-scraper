            "answer_text": "Very, very few. No one has an exact count of how many people were at their first concert, but we do know that way past their first performance, they only had 350 fans (Suga made each of them personalized gifts). And even when they got their first win, their fans were small enough to take them all to a movie and a dinner. Furthermore, I remember in some Behind the Scenes thing or maybe Burn the Stage a member of the rap line (most likely RM or Suga) said that performing at the Tokyo Dome? seemed surreal next to the forty, fifty fans when they debuted. This might not necessarily be 100% factually accurate, but you get the point. Hope this helps!

            "answer_text": "From 400 fans at their first showcase on June 2013 to over 57,000 ARMY at each of their two concerts in Wembley stadium on June 2019. Their smallest ever venue was 250 at LA Troubadour on July 2014 but that was to complete a mission for their reality show American Hustle Life. I truly don\u2019t know why people still try to down play and dismiss BTS\u2019s struggles and their bottom of the barrel beginnings. We are not trying to cry over it we are pointing out that hard work and believing in and following your dreams sometimes leads to unimaginable success. That is the power of the human spirit in all of us. Have hope and work hard for what you want in life.      This was only a 6,000 capacity venue. ",
