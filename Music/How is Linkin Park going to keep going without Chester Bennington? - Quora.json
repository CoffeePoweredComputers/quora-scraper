            "answer_text": "I have fond memories of listening to Linkin Park. I was just 7\u20138 years old when I started listening to LP. My brother introduced me to Linkin Park. My brother had an iPod Classic ( it was huge back then to own an Apple product :P) and he never let me use it XD The very first Linkin Park song that he let me listen to was \u201c In the End\u201d, and from then on I started exploring on my own. Linkin Park was, and will always be more than just a band. LP defined my childhood, and helped me get through my teenage years. Whenever I felt unhappy, they were there for me. It is going to be difficult for them. They should either continue or disband, but should never try and replace Chester. Chester was unique as he shared his pain through his songs. Nobody can come close to that. These guys have been together for a very long time and they should stick together, atleast for the sake of LP fans. ",
