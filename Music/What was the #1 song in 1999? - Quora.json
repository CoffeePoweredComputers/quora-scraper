For my money, the best regardless of critical ranking are the two standouts from The Flaming Lips The Soft Bulletin - Race For The Prize and Waitin\u2019 For A Superman, Bonnie Prince Billy\u2019s I See A Darkness, Eminem\u2019s My Name Is, one of the tracks on Sigur Ros\u2019 Ageatis Byrjun (I forget which, it\u2019s the one with the super heavy bass intro) and the title track to Primal Scream\u2019s Accelerator.

Hey, I was busy that year so did not cast my vote ;-\\ #2 on the list that year was TLC with \u201c No Scrubs\u201d Crap year for music that year, thus I paid little attention to most of it, but there were some astounding songs ground out that year. But another answer for another time. ",
