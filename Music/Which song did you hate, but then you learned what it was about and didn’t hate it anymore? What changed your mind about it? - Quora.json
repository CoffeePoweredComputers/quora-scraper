            "answer_text": "[Why does Quora allow the meaning of questions to be totally reversed? Whoever changed the meaning is not asking a sincere question] Which song did you hate but then you learned what is was about and didn\u2019t hate it anymore? What changed your mind about it? Simply Red are not a band l liked, Moneys too Tight too Mention was a good cover (Mick Hucknall has a great blue eyed soul voice) but little that they released afterwards interested me. Holding Back the Years was a massive hit, but l wasn\u2019t listening because of the glossy production but.. \u2026 as l discovered later Holding Back the Years has a back story, it was a song Mick Hucknall wrote when he was 17. He was inspired to write stream of conscious lyrics by an art teacher lecturing about stream of conscious art. His mother had left him when he was three and he was raised single handedly by his working class father who never remarried and tried to look out for his son from the perspective that life\u2019s circumstances gave him. Like many fathers and sons, they fought and there was, no mother and no referee. Holding back the yearsThinking of the fear I've had so longWhen somebody hearsListen to the fear that's goneStrangled by the wishes of paterHoping for the arms of materGet to me the sooner or later Holding back the tearsChance for me to escape from all I knowHolding back the tears'Cause nothing here has grownI've wasted all my tearsWasted all those yearsNothing had the chance to be goodNothing ever could, yeah I'll keep holding on x 4, so tight His mother tried to reconnect after the hit but seeing the hurt it gave his father, he discontinued and stayed loyal to the man who raised him.  Frantic Elevators - Holding Back the Years - the Miles Davis influenced trumpet solo and chorus would come later Another nice touch, he gave a co writing credit to his oldest friend Neil Moss who he\u2019d grown up and who he\u2019d written songs with in a punk band, the Frantic Elevators as they toured the UK, supported the likes of the Fall and recorded John Peel sessions. As this is an alternative rock/punk area, this is the original Frantic Elevators single version, Mick Hucknall also changed his music direction after releasing this tune and left punk behind.

            "answer_text": "Well, I don't have a song I HATE, you know, but there is a song that kinda made me look at a song a different way. It's the song from the Foo Fighters: \u201cAll my Life\u201d. At first, the lyrics I heard made me think it was some type of \u201chate\u201d song because the way the singer (Dave Grohl) screamed in the lyric part: \u201cDone, done on to the next one\u2026\u201d But one day, I was curious to search up the lyrics and so, I found out it was something more dirtier. I searched up the song story and found out that the song talks about one of Dave Grohl's desires to have oral sex\u2026.. I mean, it's my favorite Foo Fighters song but it cringes me a little every time I hear a lyric like \u201c\u2026.Over and over down on my knees. If I get any closer, and if you open up wide. And if you let me inside, on and on I've got nothing to hide, on and on I've got nothing to hide\u2026\u201d ",
