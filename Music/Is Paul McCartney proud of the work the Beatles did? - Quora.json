            "answer_text": "I would hope so. He wouldn't be where is today without them. He would not have been given carte blanche to record & release everything he has done since. I have heard him make disparaging comments about Wings, and I think they are off the cuff, and unfounded. I myself discovered him and respected his work in this period, then picked him as my favorite Beatle after the party. It was just simpler for me as a child to recognize his contributions among a group of other major talents. Heck, George was outselling him after the breakup. A living artist with such a long, ongoing career & large body of work might subconsciously be directing his attention, and the fans, to the current situation. After all, anybody who \u201ccreates\u201d is trying to top their previous work, or reinvent themselves. He\u2019s got a new record out to promote. So regardless of what he says in interviews, and there have been many lately, I\u2019ll bet deep down he\u2019s content with his old gig - just not the way it ended. He did try to keep them together -George quit first. Faced with your own mortality, there is a desire to set the record straight-or at least attempt to leave your legacy to history as you would want it. ",

            "answer_text": "How could he not be proud? Paul is a very talented guy who loved his fellow Beatles and still does. Yes, there were the inevitable conflicts, as you would have had with any creative group. Their accomplishments had an enormous impact on music and they added immensely to the music of their day. Much of it was luck and serendipitous timing, but much of it was due to four remarkably talented guys working together to make music that their fans loved. Based on recent interviews with Paul, I believe Paul would agree with all of what I wrote above. Maybe he will comment. I\u2019d love that. Thanks for your question. ",
