            "answer_text": "The Bible does tell us that when the world gets to the state, \u201cas in the days of Noah\u201d - unspeakable wickedness, then the end is near, but the world has been very bad for a long time, but now they are calling evil good, and good evil - that's a critical sign. Another thing to consider is the passage in Matthew where the desciples ask Jesus what will be the signs of the end of the age: Now as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, \u201cTell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?\u201d And Jesus answered and said to them: \u201cTake heed that no one deceives you. For many will come in My name, saying, \u2018I am the Christ,\u2019 and will deceive many. And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in divers places. All these are the beginning of sorrows. \u201cThen they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for My name\u2019s sake. And then many will be offended, will betray one another, and will hate one another. Then many false prophets will rise up and deceive many. And because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold. But he who endures to the end shall be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come. Matthew 24:3-\u202c14 NKJV He said christians will be hated. The Holy names of the Holy Trinity are the ONLY one's blasphemed by this world, no other religion is blasphemed like Christianity is. Also,there is less tolerance of Christianity, than any other religion, despite the fact that true Bible believing Christians are the most passive people on earth. The world hates God, Jesus and Christians, that is a sign that we are near the end. Earthquakes in diverse place means many, in different places, the earthquakes you hear about on the news are only a tiny fraction of whats really happening, just go to volcano watch or any seismic measuring website, and you'll be shocked, the world is experiencing between 80 and 100 earthquakes A DAY. Also we are deffinately experiencing more pestilences /plagues/diseases than ever before, we are already in the time Jesus described as The Beginning of Sorrows. Also, God says, \u201cIn the last days, I will pour out my spirit upon mankind and your young men and old men will have dreams and visions, and your daughters will prophesy. That seems to be happening. But remember, no man, nor angels nor anyone knows the time, only God knows. ",

            "answer_text": "Not necessarily. It\u2019s more that, your preacher does not know for certain what the future holds, that is knowledge reserved for only God. Yes, Jesus could return at any minute, any second. But none of us know what minute, what second. None of us know what day, what hour, what year, what century. Your preacher is not lying with that statement, he\u2019s just providing far too narrow a claim. Even if he\u2019s been studying Revelation with mad fervor, still he would not know, still, he could only guess. The Bible does say Jesus is coming soon, but do you know where it says that? Revelation. The book of the end times, of what is to come, of what the future holds. Jesus will be coming soon after the events of Revelation are in motion. Studying the book of Revelation, focusing on the end of time, is not remotely as important as some would think. Such a fervid study only distracts from what matters now. Spreading the gospel, spreading salvation. Jesus won\u2019t come at all when any of us expect. What\u2019s the point in try to predict an unpredictable event? \u201cBut concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only.\u201d Matthew 24:36 ESV \u201cYou also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.\u201d Luke 12:40 ",
