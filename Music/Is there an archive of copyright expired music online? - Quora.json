            "answer_text": "U.S. Perspective Due to a quirk in copyright law, there are no audio recordings with expired copyright durations. None. Not even Edison\u2019s first recording. Audio recordings did not actually have copyright until a few decades ago. But when the law instituted for these media, it did not set an expiration date. Due to the process by which the law was created, it will sunset in 2064, at which point audio recordings will enter the public domain. I suspect that Open Music Archive is either not in the U.S. or is using the standard expiration dates for other media\u2014which is incorrect, but not surprising. Now sheet music is in the public domain, as per standard copyright duration. But your post said \u201crecordings\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "US perspective:  You should be aware that there are two copyrights associated with recorded music.  One copyright for the specific recording, and one for the underlying music.  They both need to be in the public domain for you to use them. Beethoven's 9th Symphony is in the public domain BUT the 1984 recording of the Berlin Philharmonic's performance is still under copyright. US Federal copyright protection for sound recordings began in 1972 so older recordings are not protected by federal copyright laws.  However, they may be protected under state law, depending on the law of the state where it was recorded. So first you need to make sure the song is in the public domain, then you need to make sure the recording is as well. ",
