            "answer_text": "Obviously anything like that is apt to be a subjective judgment; what I consider \u2018better\u2019 may not be the same as yours. A complicating factor is that often the acoustic version comes out once you have already heard the original version enough for it to be commonplace, and as such retains novelty value - so it may feel like it\u2019s \u2018better\u2019 just because of that. However, with those disclaimers in mind\u2026 there are a few. The one which most fits for me would be Radiohead\u2019s \u201cCreep\u201d. There is an acoustic version on the \u2018My Iron Lung\u2019 EP which, to me, is far more enjoyable than the original one from the \u2018Pablo Honey\u2019 album. ",
