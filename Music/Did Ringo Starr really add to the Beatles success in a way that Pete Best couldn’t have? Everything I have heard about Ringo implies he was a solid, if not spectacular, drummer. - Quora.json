            "answer_text": "Watch A Hard Day\u2019s Night. Yes, Ringo added to the Beatles success. He wasn\u2019t a \u201cgreat\u201d drummer according to the snobs, but I\u2019m not so sure that if he was an amazing drummer it would have added much to the Beatles. When it comes to instrumentation, what made the Beatles stand out was how they worked together. If they wanted a sound, they would figure out how to get it. A rock and roll band is not a symphony orchestra. Not everyone has to be \u201ctight\u201d. And shocking as it may be, popularity is paramount in a rock group. Popularity among the fans certainly, but also being popular among your band mates. And Ringo was both. This is why I suggest you watch A Hard Day\u2019s Night. Does Ringo bash? Does Ringo swing? Does Ringo roll? Maybe not, but he does the one thing that makes a successful drummer. Ringo CLICKS. He clicks with the audience, he click with his mates. They just get along so fabulously in person, on stage, and on record. He\u2019s RINGO! Remember that the Beatles are entertainers. Image, performance, personality, all these things went with the package for a group that was successful on the radio, in television, and in movies. Ringo is an enormous part of Beatlemania and the cult of the Beatles. It\u2019s a testament to his ability as a drummer that he wasn\u2019t just a funny face or stage-presence and that he always contributed to the records on every track. Except for a couple of early recordings and maybe two White Album cuts which were recorded while he was on vacation and Macca drummed on personally (competently at best), they never once had to replace him or record over his drumming with some hardened, professional conservatory-trained session player. He always delivered exactly what the others asked for. Every Beatles record has one track where he sings vocals for a reason. It was like an artist\u2019s final signature on a painting. This is a Fab FOUR record. We hereby sign (sing) together. I won\u2019t get into the politics of what being in the Beatles was like according to various sources, including the guys themselves. But I will say this, I\u2019m like 99% certain that a Beatles without Ringo Starr would probably have lasted about two records tops. There would have been no Beatlemania. There would have been no A Hard Day\u2019s Night (literally. the title is attributed to a Ringo saying) or Help! Certainly no Rubber Soul/Revolver and beyond. They probably would have started arguing during Love Me Do and broken up acrimoniously after charting with a couple of covers of 1950\u2019s staples and maybe some song foisted on them by their producer. They would have been like Gerry and The Pacemakers. They wouldn\u2019t be The Beatles. People forget that it isn\u2019t just the quality of the songwriting or the playing. WHO is just as important as what, which is why I always say that if you went back in time to 1961 and started trying to hawk all the Beatles songs as your own, you\u2019d be lucky if you were able to sell a couple in tin-pan alley and have them become minor hits for soon to be forgotten artists.

            "answer_text": "\u201cDid Ringo Starr really add to the Beatles success in a way that Pete Best couldn\u2019t have? Everything I have heard about Ringo implies he was a solid, if not spectacular, drummer.\u201d This is what comes of reading idle nonsense written by naysayers, instead of directly learning about something yourself. The only way to really understand enough to answer such a question logically, is to learn enough about music and how it is crafted, so as to be able to tell the difference between a performer who is \u201csolid, but not spectacular,\u201d and one who is a core creative artist, contributing unique and essential elements to the final product. Go and STUDY DRUMMING. Not as in trying to become a drummer yourself, that\u2019s unnecessarily expensive. Just gather up a large quantity of songs that you enjoy or don\u2019t care for all that much, by leading artists and by those who just had a song or so become hits. Then listen carefully to each drummers participation. You will find that some drummers just keep the beat, and add occasional \u201cfills\u201d as required, while others actually play an entire evolving and unique pattern of drumming, clearly designed to support the changes in the music that take place during the song. Ringo was for the Beatles, the latter kind of drummer. If you pay attention to the details, you will learn that on some of their most popular and powerful hits, that it was Ringo's drumming that lifted the song out of mundane lethargy, and made it into a genuine work of true art. The only people who assert that Ringo in the Beatles was a \u201csolid but not spectacular drummer,\u201d are the kind of limited-appreciation folks who think that what makes a drummer great, is the ability to play twice as many drums during a song as anyone else, and play twice as many beats and cymbal crashes as anyone else, whether the song warrants it or not. The truly GREAT creative musicians of any kind, are the ones who play exactly what the music most requires, including playing nothing at all, when that is what is needed. ",

            "answer_text": "To answer the question we must go to the some of the conclusions we can draw from the expert Beatles biographer Mark Lewisohn and his Tuned In biography of the pre 1964 yrs. Mark uncovered and clarified some commonly held beliefs, like Pete Best, a novice drummer with little experience was the ONLY drummer they could get to go to Germany. Ringo was in another group at the time. They barely knew of him if at all at the time. So they took Pete to Germany and he became a Beatle. For 2 yrs he played and improved, but he didn\u2019t mix well with the other 3 personalities, often going off on his off duty time while Paul George and John grew closer. Pete developed some as a drummer but the other 3 were always improving their music and became a tight band that astounded everyone when they returned home. Pete\u2019s drumming was good for informal crowds and gigs. The Beatles got several minor recording work and each time Pete was limited by the producers to basic support. The Decca tryout shows him playing basic drums but nothing impressive, and some say his timing was off. All 4 were nervous and didn\u2019t get the contract. Then EMI and George Martin came along. Martin didn\u2019t want to use Best on the drums for recording. He also said he didn\u2019t tell them to drop Best as he could play live adequately. But the 3 Beatles were always seeking out better sound and they were consistently being told Best was not the Best. By the time they met Martin they had known Ringo for years, getting along well together, and they played with Ringo as a fill in drummer a few times. The difference to the 3 musicians was astounding. The EMI recording was the last chance for Best and they decided to take Martin\u2019s refusal to use Best as just cause. The 3 decided to let him go, ordering (quite cowardly as they later made known) their manager to inform Best. Ringo was about to be available, so they asked him to join. Ironically, Ringo was also not approved by Martin as his 1st performance in the studio was off because Ringo was nervous, as the other 3 had been at Decca. But Ringo got another shot and impressed Martin enough to let him remain the drummer in the studio on all future songs. Ringo\u2019s near perfect timing and matching personality made him a great choice for drummer, and he was just what they needed \u2014 not demanding or flashy, perfect take after take, to take them the rest of the way to the top!

Everything I have heard about Ringo implies he was a solid, if not spectacular, drummer. A~~~~~~~~~ People forget that Ringo brought more to the table than perceived drumming talent. I hate to spread rumors, but the stories I\u2019ve heard about Pete was that he was a bit of a loner. After gigs, he didn\u2019t hang out with the band\u2014is one rumor, I heard. As far as personality\u2014he didn\u2019t really fit in with the others\u2014another rumor. Ringo is bright and smart and funny. Ever notice how funny the others are? This is the direct result of being smart. Ringo fit in\u2014he could joke around on equal terms\u2014with all the others. This alone\u2014barring his drumming\u2014already makes him a better fit than Pete\u2014that is\u2014IF\u2014the rumors about Pete were true. I have no idea if they are. So even if Ringo had the same drumming skill as Pete\u2014his personality alone made him a better fit for the Beatles. His agreeable personality would allow the band to remain together longer. With Pete, the band may have lasted only 3 years. This isn\u2019t a slam on Pete\u2014the point is\u2014we have no way to know. Any change in line-up has long-term effects. Drumming is just one aspect. Personality is another. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s wholly impossible to answer that question if you include Pete Best in the equation. That\u2019s because there\u2019s absolutely no way to know what Pete Best could have or would have done had he been a Beatle. For all we know he might have had an extraordinary latent talent that would have only blossomed in the creative environment that the Beatles provided. George Harrison started out in the early 60\u2019s as solid but average lead guitarist and mediocre songwriter. Yet by the end of the 60\u2019s he had become an extraordinary songwriter, and had introduced and fused Eastern music and even Eastern scales with Western pop. Both were remarkable achievements and examples of human potential becoming fully realized, or more realized, in the right environment. And in the 70\u2019s he developed a guitar style that\u2019s instantly recognizable. There\u2019s a big difference between talent or ability and latent talent or ability. That boring bald accountant in your office or the office down the street might have been an Einstein or Shakespeare or Descartes or Winston Churchill had he been in a different environment. All we can do is measure Ringo as Ringo and what he\u2019s done, which is provide the solid grounding, perfect balance and center-point of gravity that was needed for the groundbreaking innovation of the Beatles as a whole.

            "answer_text": "Being a solid drummer was the best possible thing he could have been. He was the solidest drummer of his generation. Were any of the other Beatles spectacular players? No. Let\u2019s not kid ourselves about that. They were all capable and inventive but they all understood that their role was to serve the song, not show off. The recorded evidence shows that Pete Best was both stiff and unreliable: in the version of \u2018Love Me Do\u2019 that he plays on, his lurch into twist-beat for the middle eight sounds arbitrary because it\u2019s just not that kind of song. Ringo, by contrast, maintains the same discreet backbeat throughout because he knew that there was no need to do anything else. Forget what you\u2019ve heard about Ringo and really listen to what he plays. He practically never plays the same part twice. Each song has its own drum part unique to it. That is the kind of drummer the Beatles needed: meticulous and precise. Not a show-off. If you\u2019ve never before noticed just how varied and responsive Ringo\u2019s drumming really is, I envy you. You\u2019re in for a treat. ",

            "answer_text": "IMO the success of The Beatles did not just relate to their songs, but to their personalities also. They complemented each other as musicians and very much as singers. But their personalities seemed to blend nicely. Paul was the polite pretty one, John was in your face and witty, George was reserved and mysterious, and Ringo was effervescent and funny. The Beatles\u2019 package was a mixture of musical excellence and personalities that gave the \u2018band\u2019 an appealing persona. From the accounts I have read, George, John and Paul were not all that thrilled with Pete and it is alleged they resented his appeal with the girls because of his good looks. That in itself is evidence of friction within the band and may have impacted negatively on them. From all reports Pete was a reasonable drummer. With respect to Ringo\u2019s drumming skills, I think he has been given an unfair go by so called critics over the years. He has been judged as fair - good by some, while others have applauded his drumming. During the era of The Beatles I recall comments that he was unconventional and unique in his style. Personally, I loved his drumming, especially on \u201cStrawberry Fields Forever\u201d and \u201cAll You Need Is Love\u201d. As I have mentioned elsewhere, Ringo\u2019s drumming helped some of The Beatles\u2019 memorable songs become classics IMO. I have concluded that the negative critics over the years were probably envious and jealous of Ringo and really were not good enough themselves to judge him. Our memories of Ringo will linger for decades whereas they are but a speck of dust lost in a wind that fizzled out long ago! ",

            "answer_text": "Then what you have heard about Ringo is wrong. Being self-taught and untrained, he had his own unique style - he didn't even hold the sticks properly, clenching them in his fists rather than holding them like a pencil like a trained drummer would. He didn't lock the kick drum in with the bass guitar, as a conventional drummer would. And being a left-handed drummer playing a right-handed kit, he played unconventionally, putting emphasis in places where others wouldn't because he led with his left hand, not his right. He wasn't a flashy drummer - he wasn't interested in drum solos or showing off, but he understood his job as a timekeeper, and did it well. He could keep time like a metronome. His playing was different, and gave the Beatles a unique sound that helped them stand apart from the crowd in a way that people couldn't quite put their finger on. And the band's popularity and influence was such that he pretty much pioneered rock drumming. Ringo's unconventional style became the norm. ",

            "answer_text": "Ringo definitely added to the Beatles success and they wouldn\u2019t have been nearly as good without him. He wasn\u2019t flashy or a thundering beast behind the kit. He was a long way off Keith Moon, Ginger Baker or John Bonham when it comes to dazzling stick work. But he was a metronome behind the kit. He played a perfect beat over and over again. While John and Paul, and later George, were experimenting and trying to work out how to play a song in the studio, they could rely on Ringo to give them what they wanted on the drums every time. George Martin commented once that he couldn\u2019t think of a single take that broke down because of Ringo. The others fluffed their parts but Ringo was bang on every time. He was the perfect drummer for the band. Pete Best on the other hand, just wasn\u2019t a very good drummer. He just lacked the skills that even a competent drummer requires. During the days in Hamburg, the Beatles had a habit of pounding the stage with their feet. John, Paul and George would stomp on the stage in unison which people assumed was their attempt to generate further excitement but the truth is that they were trying to get Pete back in time because he\u2019d wandered off the beat. Best was barely adequate for sloppy rock and roll played to drunken sailors in Hamburg\u2019s red light district. He was totally incapable in the studio. ",

            "answer_text": "I grew up listening to (and falling in love with) the Beatles\u2019 music played on an inexpensive, single-speaker record player. Something like this:  Given the limitations of the equipment, one could barely hear the rhythm section\u2014it was vocals and guitars to the fore, with the beat just thumping along in the background. In around 1969, a few other boys and I were assigned to clean up our school\u2019s auditorium the morning after a concert. The priest supervising our work told us we were free to listen to music, and powered up the sound system for our use. He may even have generously left a couple of Dermot O\u2019Brien or Larry Cunningham LPs for our entertainment. As soon as the priest had left, however, one of the other boys (who\u2019d had this gig before), put his copy of Sgt. Pepper\u2019s on the turntable and cranked up the volume.  Now, I had practically worn out my copy of Pepper\u2019s on the player at home, and thought that I knew every nuance on the album. Oh, the revelation of listening to Sgt. Pepper\u2019s on good sound equipment! I remember in particular my amazement at hearing the bass and drums clearly for the first time. Paul was playing these inventive counter melodies, instead of just contributing a rhythm 1\u20132\u20133 like a string bass player would. But the drums! Every part that Ringo played was different, unique to that song, and his drumming was quite melodic in places (e.g., \u201cA Day in the Life\u201d). It was not until the George Martin remasters were released by EMI in 2009 that most people could hear the Beatles in their full glory on our players at home. And once again, the rhythm section was a revelation. By that point, of course, few disputed that Paul McCartney was a really good\u2014maybe great\u2014bass guitarist. But I challenge anyone to listen to the 2009 remasters and then claim that Ringo Starr is anything less than a stellar drummer. ",

He wasn't solid, nor was he particularly consistent, 2 things that a good drummer HAS to have! As a musician myself, let me give you an idea of what happened there. I've played with more than one drummer who had NO 'foot'; I couldn't get a 'beat' from them, and that made it REALLY hard to play well! One in particular played a lot of flashy fills, but was all around the beat; of course, he thought he was God's Gift to Drummers, so you couldn't tell HIM anything\u2026 Pete Best was that kind of drummer! A friend of mine - who, sadly, died of cancer several years ago - was the kind of guy that you could set behind a drumset, give him a beer, and he'd be as happy as a clam, and play all night long! He was solid - not flashy - and could play pretty much ANYTHING! Ringo was THAT kind of drummer! Which one would YOU rather play with? The Beatles had that same choice; of course, they DEFINITELY made the RIGHT choice! ",

            "answer_text": "Pete as the other Beatles have mentioned in the past got the job because he had a set of drums. He wasn\u2019t that good. George Martin didn\u2019t ask that Pete be fired. He just told them that he was going to use a session drummer. So the Beatles or should say Brian took it upon themselves to get rid of Pete. They liked Ringo and had played with him on numerous occasions. He was the perfect fit. George Martin was impressed. In those days they didn\u2019t have click tracks or drum machines. Martin said Ringo was their click track. That\u2019s how spot on he was. Listen to \u201cBack In The USSR\u201d. A song on the White Album that was recorded after Ringo quite. It\u2019s kind o messy. Reason? All three of the other Bealtes contributed to the drums. It was a composite of all three. The song also isn\u2019t in perfect time. Kind of wonders. Yeah I would say Ringo was rock solid. If I had the money I would have Ringo and Jim Keltner playing on every song I ever recorded. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve always loved the Beatles\u2026from when I was 10 years old in 1964 to this day. But it wasn\u2019t until the last 10 or so years that I REALLY listened closely and in great detail, dissecting every musical nuance\u2026..especially Paul\u2019s bass and Ringo\u2019s drums. Keeping with the question\u2026. First, it is well agreed that Pete Best was adequate at best (no pun intended). Second, after deep listening, it is my personal opinion that Ringo was a drum genius. Yes, he was never flashy. But what he added to each song was exactly what the song needed. His fills and occasional flairs were always spot on to the song. I marvel at his contributions to some of the greatest recordings ever created. I think back to late 1963 and the first times I heard \u201cI Want to Hold Your Hand\u201d. To me, the little triplet drum flairs between the verse and chorus was as delightful as any other part of the song and still gives me goosebumps. Ringo was no less important to the whole of the Beatles than any other of the group and I truly doubt any other drummer would have compared at the time. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, Ringo was compatible with the other Beatles personality wise. His nature was upbeat, like his drumming. He added a lift and a certain creative quality to their sound . Pete Best, on the other hand, was a plodding drummer with a heavy foot. He was often off time, which was apparent in the ballads ; in Love Me Do, you can hear how he tears the song down with his attempts at an alternate rhythm . He had no feel. In the Hamburg clubs, he was probably effective on the fast rock n roll songs. They were rowdy places, and Pete could kick it into gear . He wasn\u2019t horrible. Otherwise they would have gotten rid of him sooner .The proof is that the Beatles were gaining positive attention there .He was actually popular back in Liverpool too, but from all acounts it was for his looks. In all respects, Pete Best was very acceptable as a live drummer in a provincial setting, but not on the international road map . Ringo was perfect for the Beatles. He made them ready for the world .

Ringo \u2018fit in\u2019 with the lads, and was a rock solid player and performer. His playing in 1963 thru 1965 was good, if not spectacular for simple Rock n Roll music. He put the \u2018beat\u2019 in The Beatles, and was the final link in the chain!  I saw an old talk show interview with Pete Best on TV recently. He \u2018claimed\u2019 that he was totally blindsided by the group when their manager fired him. He also said that he held no grudges and wished them well. What complete bullshit! Pete was the dark, handsome one in the early Beatles who never really fit in with the band. His \u2018teddy boy\u2019 looks didn\u2019t match once Brian Epstein entered into the picture. His playing was criticized by Producer George Martin, who insisted on using a session drummer in the studio. The writing was on the wall. ",

John, Paul and George knew it the first time Ringo ever sat in for Pete on a set he missed. What's more Ringo fit them personally quickly becoming a close friend of theirs, Pete had no inclination to be their friend. The Beatles were a tight knit band of extremely close friends save for Pete, it was one of the unique attributes of the band.

Parlophone agreed to release a single, Love Me Do, but it substituted a session musician instead of Best for the release. They were very young and handled it badly. I wish history had shown that at least one of the other three had the gumption to go and break it to Pete that they couldn\u2019t - seriously couldn\u2019t - risk continuing with a drummer whose contribution their recording company had taken off the record. I wish they\u2019d spoken to him afterwards rather than ignoring him until the Anthology recordings were released and I\u2019m glad he at least got his due for those. They behaved like asses. But did Ringo add something that Pete Best couldn\u2019t? Yes. The recording company let him on the records in a way they didn\u2019t with Pete. That\u2019s the objective fact. ",

Don\u2019t get me wrong; their music was great and something new. But what really pushed them over the top was their personalities, especially as shown in the two movies they made early on \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Might\u201d and then \u201cHelp.\u201d Ringo had the right personality to fit with the rest of the group and was a wonderful comic actor. I don\u2019t think that Pete Best could have brought any of that to the Beatles. Think of the Marx Brothers. You had Groucho, Chico, and Harpo. But there were other brothers as well and in the earliest movies there was a fourth brother joining in, Zeppo or maybe it was Gummo. But the fourth brother had no real flare for comedy and became something of an afterthought or straight man. That is what Pete Best would have been; and it would have hindered the development of the other three as personalities. Also, don\u2019t forget some of Ringo\u2019s malapropisms that led to some of their best songs, such as \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night,\u201d \u201cEight Days a Week,\u201d and \u201cTomorrow Never Knows.\u201d Ringo brought a lot more to the Beatles than just a back beat.

My ears tell me that, from the earliest recordings the Beatles made with him that he was a solid drummer who came up with a lot of very unique parts, who could play the myriad rhythms of r&b, country, rockabilly, pop, \u201cUK beat\u201d music and more. And yet all those songs have his unique stamp on them. My ears tell me that he was the BEST musician in the group, at least in 1963 (when they recorded the most songs: all those BBC songs!) doing exactly what was right for each song, yet expressing his ample personality abundantly through his drumming. You can read a million opinions. In the end its your ears who should make your decisions. Not some writer who uses mathematics to prove that one drummer is better than another. There is no wrong way to do art, especially rock music. It\u2019s not engineering. Ringo did it his way and you like it or you don\u2019t. ",

I think because he doesn\u2019t have a huge library of flashy solos he doesn\u2019t get the attention he deserves. My favorite bit of his drumming is on \u201cNowhere Man.\u201d His work is subtle and very musical. Personality wise he was by all accounts a better fit than Pete Best. He was not only the musical, but also the emotional anchor for the group. In an answer to a similar question a Quoran noted that Ringo had a special knack for picking up on the quirks and suggestions of the other three. George Martin was never really sold on Pete\u2019s ability and that probably would have meant a parade of studio musicians. The impact of that situation would be very hard to judge, although you can certainly make the argument that part of the group\u2019s greatness came from the creative juices that flowed when they were in the pressure-cooker studio environment.

He had a tendency to use triplets in his fills that somehow suggests \u2018show-biz.\u2019 This has a comic effect to me, but instead of satirizing, it just makes it good fun. ",
