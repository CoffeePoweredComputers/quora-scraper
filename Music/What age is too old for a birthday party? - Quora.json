            "answer_text": "There is no age limit to birthday parties. I enjoy getting my friends and family together not necessarily to celebrate me, but to have fun! When I was turning 17, I asked my mother if I could have a birthday party at the local skating ring. She said to me, \u201cDon\u2019t you think you are too old for a skate party\u201d? I said, \u201csome people may think that but everyone will have fun\u201d! I invited only a few close friends and while they were all teens and did not want to admit it at the time, they had a blast and even thought about having their parties there as well. When I turned 35, I decided I wanted to have a party. I told hubs that I wanted to celebrate my birthday at a bowling alley. He crinkled his nose and said, \u201cyou don\u2019t even bowl normally, but ok\u201d. We invited my sister, my mother, his dad, stepmom and stepbrother as well as the stepbrother\u2019s daughter (our step-niece). We all had pizza and a blast bowling. It was hilarious to see my mom and his dad bowling as they really got into it and were proud of their scores (I think we stopped keeping score after the first game and just enjoyed tossing the ball down the lane). Our niece who was about 12 also really enjoyed bowling (I think it was her first time ever) with her dad and grandma. It was a lot of fun. So much so that everyone thanked me for having a party there and said we should get together and bowl more often. I enjoy doing odd things randomly so my birthday is just an excuse to me. I was recently thinking about my next birthday party. I\u2019ll be 38 this year and I\u2019m thinking LaserTag. =) ",

            "answer_text": "absolutely 100% I mean this with all my heart. By the time you are dead, birthday parties should probably stop. Until then, enjoy! Now having said that, I will add that my son at age 8 decided he didn\u2019t enjoy birthday parties. He is one of those kids who is happier with one or two true friends than a dozen aquaintances, so when he said he did not want a party anymore in third grade I respected that. Instead we took his best buddy and did something extra special. He enjoyed it more and so did I to be truthful. Now he and his sister are 3 years and 30 minutes apart, exactly My oldest birthday is ten days later. They are all grown up and going there different ways. This year, my middle child, his sister turned 30. So what did I do? I planned a surprise party for the 3 of them. I told each child the party was for the other one and they had to give me the names and email addresses of their friends so that I could get in touch with them. I wound up having a huge party for the three of them at a local park. It was a thunderous success, even for the anti party kid! So much so that he asked if we could do it again next year. Enjoy your parties every year. Life\u2019s too short not to celebrate it. ",
