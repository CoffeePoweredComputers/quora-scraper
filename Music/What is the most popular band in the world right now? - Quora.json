            "answer_text": " The Beatles Now, you may be asking why The Beatles. They broke up in 1970. Well, judging from total sales and just the name, they are easily the most recognizable band of all time. Even to this day, they outsell many artists. And the fact that Paul McCartney is very relevant today, it helps. From 2000 - 2010, they're 1 Album was the best selling album of the decade. It outsold Justin Bieber, One Direction, Drake, Rihanna, etc. From 1991 - 2016, they sold more than 65 million albums. This does NOT include digital sales. Yet, their digital sales are in the millions. In 2014, a plaque was placed in JFK Airport to commemorate their 50th anniversary of coming to America.  The Beatles have broken up almost 50 years ago. Yet, they are still always talked about. Their music still selling millions every year. The 4 names of John, Paul, George, and Ringo being so recognizable. Some people may think the Beatles are overrated \"and all that rubbish.\" -George Harrison But it still doesn't change the fact that they are still so popular today. And let's not forget, their most recognizable songs\u2026 Let It Be Hey Jude Yesterday Yellow Submarine Here Comes the Sun I strongly believe The Beatles are still the most popular band/artists today. And it'll be like that for generations. ",

            "answer_text": "According to what I know about basic teenagers these days, its BTS. What the hell does \u201cBTS\u201d even mean? Oh right, Jackfilms did a video on it. I like to think it stands for Boys That Suckle. Well, anywho, based on YouTube subs, its One Direction, but they aren\u2019t together anymore, so now (and my own personal opinion), its Coldplay, with 12 million subs (And go ahead and say, Well Megan, Maroon 5 has more subs!!!!!, but I think Adam Levine has an annoyingly high voice, so they don\u2019t count. And also Penatonix has more, but to me they\u2019re just a cover band.) . But what do subscribers even mean nowadays? Sure, Pewdiepie has 60 million of them, but Jake Paul has said \u201c5 mil on Youtube been six months\u201din his amazing song It\u2019s Everyday Bro, so I\u2019ve just stopped subscribing to people. Lets see where that ranks them! It means that they have more subs than, hmm let\u2019s see\u2026.. Ricegum. Coldplay has more subs than the one and only Ricegum. The Youtuber with over 10 million subs and platinum recording artist for \u201cIt\u2019s Everynight Sis\u201d and most known for his rivalry with Jake Paul, has less subs than a world-famous alternative-rock band with over 100 million records sold worldwide and 7-time Grammy award winners? *gasp* SHOCKING! (Oh, just did a check, and turns out that Linkin Park has almost 10,000 more subs then Coldplay, so, I guess Linkin Park is the most popular band in the world. I dunno, I just know one song by Linkin Park, and that is \u201cCrawling\u201d. And also Coldplay has one song on the \u201cMemes\u201d playlist on Spotify, Linkin Park has three.) idk what i\u2019m doing because i answered the question in the first sentence. I need to get over my Coldplay addiction. I\u2019ll go listen to Drake or something now. ",
