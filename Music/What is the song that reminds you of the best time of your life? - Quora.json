            "answer_text": "Before I graduated from high school, I had already enlisted in the Army, and I was due to leave for basic training just two months after graduation. Having started school a bit younger than most of my classmates, I was still 17 at the time. Most of my friends were bust celebrating their recent graduation, spending the summer having or attending parties, while I was preparing to leave for the Army. On my last night before leaving for basic training, I met some friends who wanted to make my last night at hone memorable. The night ended up being a whirlwind of activity, meeting one group of friends and acquaintances after another, jumping in car after car, riding here and there. It\u2019s difficult to recall all that occurred that night, but one thing that still stands out is a song that was still newly released at that time, and was heard several times that night in totally separate places unconnected to each other. I first heard it in one of the first cars I rode in that night, which had an excellent stereo system. Hours later it came on a radio that was being played at one location I visited that night. Finally, after I arrived home at the end of the night and turned on my own radio, it played a final time. I didn\u2019t know it at the time, but the song would effectively become the theme song for that night and for much more. It became a sort of theme song for the entire ending of one part of my life, and the beginning of another, then unknown part of my life. I was only vaguely aware that nothing would ever be even close to the same for me. The people I knew then would go off on their own ways, many of whom I would never see or talk to again. Places that were familiar to me and commonly visited, would never be visited again by me. Even the overall tone and outlook of my life, as well as many others from that time, would soon change forever. In a way, it was the end of innocence in my life. Responsibility, commitment, obligation, and necessity would come to dominate life after that point. On that last night, I look back now knowing I really had no idea of just how much was coming to an end, or what was about to begin. On that last night, I didn\u2019t grasp the magnitude of change to come, and had no sense of how much that night would come to mean to me. For better or worse, the song heard multiple times that night takes me back to that night and to what used to be, and would never be again. The song is from the \u201cHoly Diver\u201d album by Ronnie James Dio, \u201cRainbow in the Dark\u201d.  ",

            "answer_text": "When I was a teenager, I worked hard to hone my skills compiling mix tapes full of Sad Songs to Wallow To. (Listen, breaking up with your boyfriend of three weeks is super tragic.) Even now, twenty years later, those are the songs that can instantly transport me back to those times of high angst, and if you\u2019ve ever experienced this phenomenon (and haven\u2019t we all?), you already know how much power music has to not only reflect our moods but also shape them, as well as shape our memories of certain times and places. It\u2019s in this spirit that I invite everyone to put their old mix-tape skills to work and start creating a custom collection of feel-good songs. Songs that make us smile, that remind us of good times, that can turn a bad mood on its head. Happy Songs to Get Up and Dance To. I\u2019ve listed some of my favorites below (and probably embarrassed myself in the process, but, oh well...): 1. \u201cHappy\u201d by Pharrell Williams. Just because it\u2019s an obvious choice doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a good one. This is the happiness anthem of our time. 2. \u201cSay Hey (I Love You)\u201d by Michael Franti and Spearhead. Turn it up and then go dance in the street. 3. \u201cI Gotta Feeling\u201d by the Black Eyed Peas. Queue this up when you need to get pumped, whether for a blind date or a PTA meeting. 4. \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believing\u201d by Journey. This is a classic, but anything that makes you close your eyes and sing at the top of your lungs with one fist clutched passionately to your chest will have a similar mood-boosting effect. 5. \u201cKodachrome\u201d by Paul Simon. A good reminder to live life in color. 6. \u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World\u201d by Iz Kamakawiwo\u2019ole. It\u2019s not high-energy, but it will fill you with warmth and wonder. 7. \u201cHey Ya!\u201d by OutKast. Before Taylor Swift had us all shake, shake, shaking it off (also a great pick), remember how we were all shaking it like a Polaroid picture? ",
