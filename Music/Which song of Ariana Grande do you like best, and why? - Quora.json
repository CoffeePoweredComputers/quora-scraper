            "answer_text": "Ugh this is going to be a hard one to answer! I'm going to say, In My Head Just for this response because I feel like a lot of people can relate to it and its a really catchy tune In My Head~  Ok Lets go over the lyrics \"Here's the thingYou're in love with a version of a personThat you've created in your head That you are trying to, but cannot fixUh, the only thing you can fix is yourselfI love you, this has gone on way too longEnough is enoughI'm two blocks away, I'm coming over\" We think that this was a voicemail with her tour director/bestie, Doug Middlebrook sent her. Ariana has been going though some hard times with breaking up it her ex fiance, her best friend/ex boyfriend dying, the hate growing, manchester and having to make to albums, do tours and probably more stuff we don't even know about. Painted a pictureI thought I knew you wellI got a habit of seeing what isn't there This line is about how in her head, she had made up a boy that she thought she knew everything about but how she didn\u2019t realize that she was dating a person with different struggles, but she mad up a dream man. She states that she has done this in past relationships/ this wasn\u2019t the first time. Caught in the moment Tangled up in your sheets One moment Pete and Ariana were in bed, and Pete asked to be her husband. Ariana was in so much shock that he asked her since they haven't been dating for a long time. Ariana said yes without realizing that Pete wasn\u2019t who she thought he was. When you broke my heartI said you only wanted half of me This sentence is a reference to her song better off on sweetener (And if we\u2019re being honestI\u2019d rather your body than half of your heart) Ariana claims that she felt like Pete was only with her because of \ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc4c (If u know what i mean). My imagination's too creativeThey see demonI see angel, angel (angel), angelWithout a halo, wingless angel Ariana\u2019s friends and family were glad that they broke up. Ariana felt like everyone saw pete and mac as bad people and ariana saw them as good. Mac always called ariana an angel. Falling, falling, but I never thought you'd leave meFalling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh Ariana kept losing herself and felt lost in her mind, but she never thought that Mac would die, and she thought of mac as a shoulder to lean on to. I thought you were the oneBut it was all in my headIt was all in my head (Skrrt, skrrt) This is just the basic concept of how she thought the boy she was dating was not the on in her head Yeah, look at you (You), boy, I invented youYour Gucci tennis shoes running from your issuesCardio good for the heart (good for the heart)I figure we can work it out, hmm Cardio is good for your figurative heart which is the emotion part of your heart. It helps you froget about the bad times while you do it. Im going to skip part of the song that we already went over My imagination's too creativeThey see Cain and I see Abel (Abel), Abel (Abel), AbelI know you're able, willing and able In the Bible, Cain and Abel are the sons of Adam And Eve. They both give offerings to god, but God holds Abel\u2019s animal sacrifice in high consideration than Cain's items. Cain was so angry that Cain \ud83d\udd2a Abel . Got punishes him by making him life filled with wandering. Some more Im gonna skip Wanted you to grow, but, boy, you wasn't budding Ariana is acting like she is the water, sunlight, soil, and everything that the flower needs to grow/Ariana gave everything to to the relationship but Pete wasn\u2019t growing/ He wasn\u2019t changing into who ariana hopes he would turn into. Everything you are made you everything you aren't This sentence that was from Kanye's 2007 track, Everything I am. (\u2018Cause everything I\u2019m not made me everything I am) Pete is a big fan of Kanye. Ariana most likely threw this as a diss to Pete. I dont quite know what the last line fully means, as ariana hasn't put any proof on that. ill leave them here for you to guess. I saw your potentials without seeing' credentialsMaybe that's the issue (Yeah, yeah)Said maybe that's the issue, ahCan\u2019t hold that shit against you, ahGuess I did it to myself, yeahThought you were somebody else, you As you can see, this song has so much worth and meaning that makes people feel included/not alone. Thank you. ",
