Liam is a good actor, handsome, has a good body, likes to surf, has an Australian accent, has a loving family, and has a gorgeous brother. Miley is a very good singer, can act some, has a loving family, has a dad who can sing, loves animals, has a free spirit and has a hillbilly twang when she wants. They were together off and on for ten years, got married about 9 months ago and then decided it wasn't going to work out. They split up, Liam went to Australia and went surfing and Miley went to Italy, I think, with Kaitlynn Carter and hung out on the Beach and made out. You will have to pick which one is better for you. ",
