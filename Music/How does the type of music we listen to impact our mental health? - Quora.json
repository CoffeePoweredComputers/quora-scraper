            "answer_text": "Music helps me a great deal. It helps bring emotions to the surface so that i can really feel, process and deal with them. Music has been instrumental in my being more able to identify my emotions when it comes to my BPD. When I\u2019m angry certain music helps me in expressing it, but I don\u2019t do that in an actual real sense. I\u2019m not getting hyped up on head-banging music so that I can go tell someone how angry I am. I listen to a variety of music, from opera to bands like Slipknot, each of them instrumental in keeping a balance within me both emotionally and mentally. Music has helped me in the grief of losing my husband; I feel like it\u2019s been a life saver. There is a dark side to the power of music. If a person is a one-genre type of individual it can feed an already existing emotion or state of being tremendously. I am in no way blaming music. I remember when parents were blaming Ozzy Osbourne for their children\u2019s dark and bad behavior. Sorry mom and dad, your child already had some form of disconnect. Them constantly listening to only this type of music just fed whatever was wrong with them. But it does illustrate how music can take ahold of something inside, whether a temporary thing or more permanent, like clinical depression and in my case my schizophrenia. When I\u2019m struggling with schizophrenia I tend to read way too much in the lyrics and they can feed my delusions. Often when Im psychotic I will take a break from music or listen more to what i call Italian opera. There are lyrics, but I can\u2019t understand them so there won\u2019t be reading too much into lyrical content or meaning. It\u2019s so odd to me that I woke up with question on my feed. Last night I was talking to my youngest adult son about whether the psychiatric world should explore music as part of therapy for people with BPD. So many of the people in my support groups find music helpful in the areas I talked about in the first paragraph. They have recently introduced me to Billie Eilish and that sub-genre. I have no clue as to whether these artists suffer from BPD or bipolar, but their lyrics are so spot on in how I feel, especially when Im BPD symptomatic. Again, moderation is key. You don\u2019t want to feed monsters, you want to soothe them. ",

So it is perpetually just out of reach for me at all times\u2026 so this song is a reminder of the emotional experiences eternally denied to me\u2026 relaxation, chill, no worries Easy said Bobby, easy said:  Grayson King x ",
