            "answer_text": "Ah, the music of my people. When you look for good country music, you need to look everywhere but where mainstream radio country is going. Look to the past.The 1970's and 1980's are a golden age of popular country. Not only was it popular, but it was very, very good. Solid stories, innovative songwriting, a social conscience and unique voices. Kenny Rogers - The Gambler  Look further in the pastThe surviving music from the first radio stations from the 20's and 30's is solid gold. It's beautiful, simple music The Carter Family - May the Circle Be Unbroken   Look to the genresBluegrass, African American Fiddle Music, Western Swing, Americana and gospel contain some of the most under-appreciated music in the western canon. Carolina Chocolate Drops - Cornbread and Butterbeans   Look to the fringesHank I was good. Hank II was OK, Hank Williams III just doesn't give a fuck. The resurgence of rockabilly and the dirty Americana of groups like the Drive By Truckers has created some awesome music Drive-By Truckers - Bulldozers and Dirt   Look to Canada (and other countries)Canadian country music is amazing. Two examples spring to mind right away. From my neck of the woods, Corb Lund has been ripping up the touring circuit with some really amazing tunes. Another small band, $100, has this smokey voiced singer that makes my heart melt. Corb was the bassist on one of Southern Alberta's best punk/hard rock/metal bands of the 1980's, the dearly missed Smalls Corb Lund - Student Visas   Look to the ladiesOne of the most poignant areas of country music are the people that don't fit in, the people that will never get a record deal because of their sexual orientation, their look or the topic of their music. There are many, many many unappreciated female country musicians, talented guitar players and fiddlers. Just a little bit of digging, a night or two in the local live music honkey-tonk and you'll be amazed at what is singing in your ears. Mary Gautheir - I Drink  ",

            "answer_text": "Picking one for the number one spot is is almost impossible since there are some really good country songs. I think \u201cIT\u2019S ONLY MAKE BELIEVE\u201d ranks up there at the very top so I will choose this one. Originally sang by Conway Twitty, Glen Campbell does a great job. He was a great artist! It's Only Make Believe\" is a song written by Jack Nance and American country music artist Conway Twitty, and produced by MGM Records' Jim Vienneau, released by Twitty as a single in July 1958. The single topped both U.S. [1] and the UK Singles Chart, [2] and was Twitty's only #1 single on the pop charts of either country. On a segment of Pop Goes The Country, Twitty states the single was a hit in 22 different countries and sold over 8 million copies. [3] It is believed that Twitty wrote his part of the song while sitting on a fire escape outside his hotel room, to escape the summer heat, in Hamilton, Ontario. Twitty had gone to Canada on the advice of another American singer, Rompin' Ronnie Hawkins, because Hawkins had told Twitty that Canada was the 'promised land' for music. [citation needed] Twitty recorded many subsequent versions of \"It's Only Make Believe\", including a 1970 duet with Loretta Lynn on their very first collaborative album, We Only Make Believe. Twitty joins in on the last verse in a 1988 uptempo cover by Ronnie McDowell, which was a #8 hit on the country music charts. Additionally, Twitty contributed to an alternative cover by McDowell.  ",

            "answer_text": "This should be fun I\u2019m only 24 so here are my top country songs. Jolene by Dolly Parton. Probably one of the first songs i ever heard as a small child my grandparents had all her Cassette tapes2. Lonely eyes by Chris Young. This song only came out in late 2014 i heard it in 2015 and memorized it so well. I feel like this is a song Conway Twitty would\u2019ve sang in his prime mainly cause it\u2019s about a one night stand with an attractive female that a guy meets at a bar. 3. Your man by Josh Turner. One of the best songs i can sing. 4. I see the want to in your eyes by Conway Twitty. Let\u2019s be honest Conway twitty was a freaking savage when he wrote and sang this song only he could write a song about an attractive married women wanting him. 5. Give it away by George Strait. Again Another savage song that was funny as heck to. 6. Coat of many colors by Dolly Parton. This song is sad yet beautiful and has such a great message my favorite line of song is. They didn\u2019t understand it and tried to make them see that one is only poor only if they choose to be. 7. Concrete angel by Martina Mcbride. A very sad song but one of my favorites 8. Three wooden crosses by Randy Travis. This song has such a powerful message if you listen to it correctly. 9. Where were you when the world stopped turning by Alan Jackson. A great post 9/11 message written in this song you can really feel Alan\u2019s emotions when singing it. 10. The gambler by Kenny Rogers. A fun song but has a great message as well. ",

            "answer_text": "I personally like Miranda Lamberts - Fastest Girl In TownThe history of the song Miranda Lambert\u2019s 'Fastest Girl in Town\u2019 is an energetic celebration of everything we love about this talented songwriter. It has an edgy, up-tempo vibe to it and again visits the theme of a rebel girl who loves her guns, guys and booze. Lambert co-wrote the song along with Angaleena Presley, her band mate with Pistol Annies. Apparently, 'Fastest Girl in Town\u2019 is one of Miranda\u2019s favorite tracks and she feels that it is an apt expression of her style. The song was released as a single in June 2012. It was also the third single from Lambert\u2019s album Four the Record. The song describes Miranda\u2019s relationship with her female companion as being edgy and tumultuous. They are portrayed as two rebels fleeing out in a car, constantly on the run. The final verse talks about how they are finally pulled over by a police vehicle. She charms the officer with her wily ways, and the badass girls are off on their adventure again. The song as such has been well-loved by fans and critics alike. Many were impressed by its unique musical approach that was different from the usual country style. The structure of the song has been described as four serves with two furious guitar solos in between. The absence of a bridge does not affect the song negatively in any way. One of the most famous things about the song was the appearance of female NASCAR driver Danicia Patrick in the video . In fact she plays the girl who is with Miranda during the entire video. Many critics have praised the video for its fun and creative approach. It is shot in the style of a movie with the song acting as the background music. The video starts with Miranda\u2019s name being shown in a movie marquee, before the audience is plunged into a four-minute outlaw story of these two rebels. During the story, Lambert needs a getaway driver and the best person for the job undoubtedly is Danicia Patrick herself. She is widely regarded as the most successful women\u2019s driver in history and her appearance in the video was definitely a bid treat for fans. The director of the video is Trey Fanjoy, who has also worked with Miranda in a number of other music videos. Blake Shelton also makes an appearance as Miranda\u2019s love interest. Fastest Girl in Town is definitely one of Miranda\u2019s best songs and most fans have been absolutely delighted with it. The song and video definitely go together really well. Check it out for fun and furious number.   ",

My likes, loves, and favorite country songs in are all tied up in emotions and mostly fond memories. I find it difficult to answer this because there are so many \u201cbest country songs\u201d, depending on the time period. Some of the country music I loved when I was young was because my grandparents loved country and played the songs, so that was 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s into the 1970\u2019s. Later on I liked the movies \u201cCoal Miner\u2019s Daughter\u201d and \u201cSweet Dreams\u201d so then I listened to Loretta Lynn\u2019s and Patsy Cline\u2019s music afterwards. In the 80\u2019s I liked \u201cDon\u2019t Close Your Eyes\u201d by Keith Whitley. A boyfriend of mine loved it. So then I ended up loving it. I also liked \u201cYou Never Even Called Me by My Name\u201d by David Allan Coe and \u201cFamily Tradition\u201d Hank William\u2019s Jr. I love this \u2026 Waylon Jennings - \"Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way\" [Live from Austin, TX] Oh my, forget it! I also like so many songs by Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash. How do you chose \u201cthe best\u201d when there are so many \u201cbest\u201d country songs? Right now I listen to Jamey Johnson now and Chris Stapleton. I recommend watching this because two of my boyfriends loved Outlaw Country and so I was influenced to love Outlaw Country. Is it possible to even possible to pick \u201cthe best\u201d country song? When you think of country music, who do you think of? Who comes to mind? Willie Nelson Willie Nelson - Always On My Mind (Official Music Video) I love this song by Willie Willie Nelson - Ride Me Back Home (Official Music Video) ",

I'm hoping to reach people who have a misconception of country music (i.e that it is only about getting drunk and trucks) and bring to light some amazing songs that you won't hear on the radio today or that have been forgotten as country has progressed.  Here's the link if you'd like to check it out :)  Steel Guitars to Memphis I don't know if you're looking for old country or new country (unfortunately, there is a HUGE difference between the two) but here are some of my favorite new country artists: Kacey Musgraves I already wrote a blog post about her (Fiercer Than Miranda Lambert: \"Stupid\" by Kacey Musgraves) but she's simply amazing.
