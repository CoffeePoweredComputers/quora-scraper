            "answer_text": "Beginning songwriters do it because they have not become masters of their craft. They know exactly what they mean and think they are conveying this to their listeners and making perfect sense to them when they are not. Every listener is making their own individual interpretation of the song lyric and hearing a completely different story and meaning. Only when the listeners hear, or read, a synopsis of the artist's intended meaning is the true meaning of the lyric ever revealed. Melody writers who are not smart enough, too lazy, etc., to write professional lyrics that make sense to the listener say things like == \u201cI don\u2019t give a Sh\u2026\u201d, \u201cMy lyrics are abstract,\u201d It\u2019s poetry,\u201d or whatever lame excuse they can come up with to hide their lack of ability.

            "answer_text": "Lots of different reasons for different songs and different songwriters. Some possibilities: Drugs.Songwriter is more melody/sound oriented and leaves lyrics til last/doesn't care that they don't make sense. It's about feelings/emotions not thoughts. Like word art in audio form.Songwriting is about connecting dots, allowing your mind to leap. The best songwriters can help others connect those same dots, to see the connections. Sometimes it doesn't quite come off. Sometimes songwriters don't care if everyone gets it.",
