            "answer_text": "I have very eclectic tastes, I grew up listening to my parents music, the big bands, and liked a lot of it. The Beatles came along when i was 10 years old and they changed my life, I became a musician not long after. Then there were so many genres of music to listen to on the radio, folk, standards, Rock, acid rock, pop, soul, R& B, it was a great time to be engulfed by all the sounds. As I grew , I still loved The Beatles, and other bands of that era, in 1969, I heard Chicago, Tower of Power, Three Dog Night, etc, Then one night in 1974 I went to see The Spinners, i loved their music, but when i saw them it woke something inside me, one of their singers, Phillippe Wynn, put on a show like i`ve never seen, ad libbing and dancing around like he was possessed by The Spirit, I was mesmerized as was the audience, Souls and funk became part of me that night, I`d been playing music for awhile, and immediately i tried to have our band play more of the soul and R&B. I still love the Spinners, and one pf the earlier bands I mentioned, Tower of Power became one of all time faves, along The Beatles , Three dog Night, and Average White Band, Ive gotten to hang with some the guys In T O P , and it made me an even bigger fan, they are still out there, making new music and playing , like no one else can.. If you get a chance and you Love Soul and Funk ya gotta see them , they will blow you away. ",

            "answer_text": "Right this moment? I\u2019ve got a Rabbit Junk album on my iPod that\u2019s been looping for about a month, with the occasional reprieve of NIN, Skrillex, or good ol\u2019 Pendulum (For the record, Rabbit Junk is absolutely awful, but when you\u2019re in the mood for that sort of thing, it\u2019s some the best awful music out there). Recently, though, I\u2019ve had an intense hankering to dig out the orchestral stuff I listened to in highschool: Beethoven, Bach, Greig, Schubert\u2026 who knows, if I can find some decent modern covers, dubstep or whatever, I might listen to those. I saw Captain Marvel the other day, so there\u2019s a few Garbage tracks running around in my head, I might dig out one or two of those albums (also part of my highschool era library). ",
