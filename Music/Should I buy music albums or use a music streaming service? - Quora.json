            "answer_text": "It really depends on how often the comsumer listens to music and what your preference is. If you are a \u201conce in a while\u201d listener then you will mostly be content with music videos on the internet, or the occassional single purchase on iTunes. But for people like me that breathe, eat and live music and require a theme song to even pick your nose, then streaming is great value for money. This is what i do personally. I use Spotify. However as you may know, artists do not make money on Spotify. So what i do is when there are some albums and songs that evoke strong emotions in me, i purchase them on iTunes as support for the artist. Also to note, the ONLY physical album i bought was the Adele 21 album - it was a gift to a friend. There are some comsumers that are highly principled and will argue that all music ought to be purchased. However, in reality that is sometimes not practical. If i bought every song and album i listen to, i shudder to think what my monthly expense would be. I think a blend of usage of purchasing and streaming platforms makes for a community of consumers with a sensitivity towards the hard work put in by artists to bring us the amazing works of art that bring unbounded pleasure to millions around the world.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a matter of personal choice to be honest. My own opinion is that streaming services sell individual artists & bands very, very short (given how pitifully low the \u201cper play\u201c fees per track are - even a really popular song that gets streamed regularly will only generate enough money monthly for the artist to buy a good cup of coffee!) But even I use Amazon Prime music (for the convenience and to sample new stuff ), so I can\u2019t preach too much! If you do genuinely have regard for the bands/artists you listen to though, I\u2019d say buy at least some full albums - they don\u2019t all have to be physical media (vinyl or CD) as there are plenty of good digital services out there (I use eMusic, iTunes and Amazon regularly and Google Play Music occasionally) And you don\u2019t have to buy new either - a good chunk of my physical collection has been acquired from charity shops & music fairs. But the artist did get the money from the original physical sale, so no ethical concerns there\u2026.. ",
