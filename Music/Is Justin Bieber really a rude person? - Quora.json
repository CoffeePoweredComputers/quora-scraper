            "answer_text": "No he is not. I\u2019ve seen many people say he \u201cspits\u201d on his fans. It\u2019s not true. It\u2019s a made up story by TMZ. There\u2019s no picture of him directly spitting on a fan ofc there\u2019s no video but people still choose to believe it after all these years with a side by side picture of him spitting somewhere and a random amgirl crying lmao . The power media has on people is scary He\u2019s never rude to people. Yes there are videos of him refusing to take pictures or getting mad at people for asking him pictures. They are not even his fans they stalk him all day and demand him for a picture. If a person is really a fan they would know about his 15 mins long rant on how he has anxiety and how people treat him like an Animal to get a picture mess with his mental health. He\u2019s always up for a hug and a nice talk he said that himself many times ",

When they invade on Bieber\u2019s privacy, that can tick him off, and in doing so, that is an invasion and Bieber can respond to their actions. Justin just wants privacy the same way teenagers want privacy when their parents invade in theirs. Bieber recently says \u201cPlease don\u2019t take my beliebers away from me. That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking for.\u201d If he was really a rude person, would he comment that about his beliebers? Think about it. ",
