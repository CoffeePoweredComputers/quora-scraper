            "answer_text": "Simply put: you can\u2019t. Art is totally subjective.  There are two ways of judging your art: 1, whether it has commercial appeal, and 2, whether you\u2019re satisfied with the final result.  1) Nobody can predict bestsellers. If someone could, that person would be a billionaire. Your agent or publisher has access to the same information as everyone else.  They can make judgments based on previous or projected data, but nobody really knows. That\u2019s what getting work published is difficult: you have to convince an agent or publisher that your work is low-risk with a high profit potential. This isn\u2019t easy to do, especially as a first-time or new author.  That\u2019s where social media marketing and internet following comes into play, but I won\u2019t bore you with those details. Long story short: the larger a premade audience you bring to the table, the better your chances are, because you\u2019re providing some kind of risk mitigation. Devoted fanbase = better chance of people actually buying your books.  There\u2019s a wealth of info about self-marketing your work, so check that out if you like.  2) Are you satisfied with what you\u2019ve created? Is it what you imagined it? Is it something you\u2019re proud of? Then you\u2019ve already succeeded and you have nothing further to prove to anyone. You\u2019re a success. Congratulations.  \u201cWell written\u201d is very subjective. If you asked 100 random people to read it, you\u2019d probably end up with something like this:  25% loved it 25% hated it 50% thought it was \u201cso-so\u201d  So you can see that\u2019s not much help.  Personally, I never concern myself with wondering \u201cIs this a great book?\u201d. I just do what feels right to me. I figure if I do that well and often enough, someone somewhere will like my vibe and voice and take a chance on me.  I think that\u2019s about the only solace you\u2019ll find as an artist. If you\u2019re asking people \u201cIs my novel any good?\u201d, you\u2019re pretty much wasting your time. Nobody can tell you. There\u2019s no clear demarcation between \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d, because it\u2019s highly subjective. Sometimes total crap because a bestseller while great work never sees the light of day. Try not to stress about that sort of thing. Follow your heart, never try to imitate others (especially not your heroes or influences), and give the world your voice and your message. That\u2019s about all any artist can do. Whether or not you get profits, applause, and awards is entirely out of your hands. That\u2019s up to the fickle tastes of the general public, and predicting their vagaries is impossible\u2026so don\u2019t worry about it.  JKW. Just Keep Writing.  Rob ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is, you can\u2019t. Seriously, if you\u2019ve spent hours writing things, you are always convinced it\u2019s great. The fact that you have asked this question is a brilliant sign that you are aware of your own inadequacies as an editor of your own works. That is good, believe me! The first thing you can do is read the whole thing aloud. Not in public, just to yourself. When you read aloud, all sorts of little glitches and grammatical errors will occur to you. All professional writers do this. It is important to print your work too. Don\u2019t think you can edit on a screen. On a computer, your eyes will skim read more than when you have the pages in front of you. Read aloud c arefully, and listen for where you stumble and hesitate. Those are the bits you need to work on. After that, I can recommend finding friends who are willing to read it for you. Perhaps not the whole book, but even if they read two or three chapters, they can give you an honest opinion. BUT Make sure you know what they like to read. If their highest literary aspiration is 50 Shades of Grey, and you have written a great crime novel \u2026 well, they may not be the subjective audience you need! ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s tougher than it sounds. And it\u2019s a sliding scale unless you know where the bar needs to be set. If you are good, you still might not be as good as Dickens or Twain. But since a lot of people who write well aren\u2019t as good as those people you shouldn\u2019t make that your standard. It also means that you are not just determining if the story is good but that the writing and structure are good. The problem is, amateurs are very good at telling you what you got wrong without you knowing whether they are correct or not. Some writing advice is genuine crap. I had a round of Alpha readers on my first novel just kind of hedge on getting back to me, and several of them didn\u2019t finish the novel. I took that as somewhat of a hint all by itself. (I now have a new set of friends, as the old joke goes.) But their advice was all over the place in terms of usability. They would often miss elements that I thought a sophisticated reader should pick up on, and I thought if I dumbed those down too much it would be condescending. On other parts they had the issues dead to rights. It also should be made clear to you that getting someone to alpha/beta read for you is a huge favor on their part. People are busy and how eager would you be if you had a full schedule and one of your friends asked you to take a gander at their writing? Alpha readers are pretty helpful but sadly they are not all created equal. And they\u2019ll each have their own theory as to what parts you got wrong. Some of them will have heard advice like \u201cnever end a sentence with a preposition\u201d and take you to task on that as if it were going to kill your chance of being published. (If you still think that, I recommend the article by Grammar Girl Ending a Sentence With a Preposition ) My point being, they can tell you something like that and become impossible to get further along with the critique. So, to write well you have to succeed at different levels. You have have spelling and grammar right at the lowest level, and you can use software to find that. I point people to grammarly for the basic stuff and Hemingway Editor for slightly more complex stuff. Try it out on the free level before you get too excited. But these can spot some of the garbage elements in your work. At the highest level you need a plot that works and has a satisfying end. If you\u2019ve got that then you\u2019ve got a lot. If you don\u2019t have that, then you need to fix it. For the mid-level, I like to read the thing aloud. I use another piece of software that can do that called yWriter, but there are others (I use yWriter to write the novels in so the speak-and-spell tool is right at hand). Hearing a voice speak your words is good for picking up on twisted and gnarled sections that you need to smooth out. It gives me a sense of flow, and a sense of pacing. For my part, I like to work scene by scene for some things and re-read and rewrite a lot. Once you have it to the point where you think a person would buy it off the rack if it were published, that\u2019s really when you take it to the Beta readers. Which may have to be different people than your Alpha readers just because they won\u2019t have seen the work before. After you\u2019ve fixed all the things you agree with from the Betas, then you can approach an editor (IMO, of course, as all of this is). The point being that an editor is going to throw stuff out that is substandard in many of the categories you\u2019ll have worked on. I recommend that you examine the books \u201cThe First Five Pages\u201d and \u201cThe First Fifty Pages\u201d. If you find, as most of us do, that you have weak sections of your ability to write, then identify them, work on them, and don\u2019t worry too much about them. For some, it\u2019s dialog, for others, it\u2019s description. Or too much expository writing. Or clumsy expository dialog. tl;dr\u2026. You can tell if you didn\u2019t write it well if you get a lot of your test readers yawning, confused, or angry that you wasted their time. ",
