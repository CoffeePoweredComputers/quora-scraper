            "answer_text": "Music and art share similar principles such as pattern, rhythm, balance and emphasis. Let's take rhythm for example. Rhythm in music is something you can tap your feet to. It tells you how to sway with the music. Rhythm affects art in a similar manner. If an artist uses rhythm correctly, he or she make your eyes dance from one point in the painting to another. It is how the artist wants you to see his/her work. Similarly, each tone or musical motif has certain weight that gives any song or melody it's overall balance. The artist also uses the same principle to add structure and balance the painting. Can you imagine all characters in the last supper seated in just one corner? No. It's balance that creates harmony.  The principles above apply to all forms of art, some way or the other. :) ",
