            "answer_text": "Lennon started off trying to sing like his idols, just like McCartney. But whereas McCartney could roar notes \u201cout of the top of his head\u201d, imitating Little Richard, John couldn\u2019t quite hit those same notes, but he could still belt it. Lennon, I\u2019d guess, went more for a Buddy Holly sound with his voice. You can also hear Lonnie Donegan\u2019s high voice and Elvis\u2019s croon in John\u2019s earlier Beatles vocals. I think the main vocal influence for Lennon\u2019s vocals in the early Beatle days is Tony Sheridan. The Beatles, apparently, were in awe of Sheridan when they first started playing with him and his influence, I think, can be heard in John\u2019s vocals in those early days. So, I\u2019d say from the very early days until maybe \u201865 or \u201966 John\u2019s voice was very rock and roll with the swagger and depth of Elvis and the higher, nasal qualities of Buddy Holly, Lonnie Donegan, and Tony Sheridan. After The Beatles made their way onto the American charts and invaded American shores, John was introduced to Bob Dylan. I\u2019m not positive, and maybe someone else can clarify this, but I think John had heard Dylan before he met him. John became very interested in Dylan\u2019s writing and you can hear the way John\u2019s songs start to become more personal and poetic in response to this influence. Think Norwegian Wood. John\u2019s voice also seems to shift away from the Elvis-style depth and swagger and more into the nose. His voice becomes a little more honest and has a bit more of a ragged edge to it. Of course, cigarettes, I\u2019m sure, added to this. It\u2019s during this period (Rubber Soul, Revolver) when Lennon\u2019s vocals become really interesting because he really starts to interpret the lyrics with his voice, adding that emotional connection that a lot of people talk about when they talk about Lennon\u2019s vocals. He could go back to that Rock and Roll roar with songs like Yer Blues, but his best moments are when he\u2019s very much himself. For a good example of this shift, listen to something like Please Please Me or Twist and Shout and then listen to Norwegian Wood, Julia, or even his later songs like Mother. I\u2019d suggest listening to Lennon\u2019s demo of a song called Help Me to Help Myself to really hear how honest and pure his voice could be. ",

Later Beatles we had bitter then disinterested John. John\u2019s voice was always a bit \u201crough\u201d compared to Paul. He had an edge to it. Paul\u2019s voice was softer. George\u2019s voice was a bit thin and at times weak; maybe a confidence issue. ",
