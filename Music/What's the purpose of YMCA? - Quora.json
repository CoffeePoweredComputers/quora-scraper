            "answer_text": "YMCA means Young Men\u2019s Christian Association. It is a worldwide organisation based in Geneva, Switzerland. For more info, refer to YMCA - Wikipedia. The National Council of YMCAs of India was formed in Madras on February 21, 1891 through the initiative of David McConaughy. The headquarters shifted to Calcutta in May, 1902. In 1964 it shifted to New Delhi, its present location. For more details visit [1]. There are several institutions in India set up with the help of or affiliated to National Council of YMCAs of India. The most popular one (at least on quora) is YMCA University of Science and Technology, Faridabad erstwhile YMCA Institute of Engineering, Faridabad, that was established in the year 1969, as a joint venture of the National Council of YMCAs of India, Govt of Haryana, and the Central Agencies for Development Aid, Bonn, Germany. It started as an Indo-German project with an aim to impart technical education to a developing India on German pattern. I don\u2019t think there is any interference of Germany or National Council of YMCAs in management of YMCAUST now. There are many myths about YMCA that it is a christian college (and they ask questions like Is there a Christian quota in ymca faridabad? on Quora.) ,private college, semi government college etc. But I would like to enlighten them that YMCAUST, Faridabad is a state University, with honorable Governor of Haryana as its chancellor. There are many institutes affiliated to National Council of YMCAs in New Delhi. Refer to YMCA-New Delhi. A2A! Footnotes[1] http:// http://www.ymcaindia.org/",
