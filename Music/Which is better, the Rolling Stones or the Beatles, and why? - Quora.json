            "answer_text": "It depends on the criteria you use. Musical ability The Stones are way out in front. Charlie is a much better drummer than Ringo. Darryl is better than Paul on the bass. All four guitarists in the Stones were better than the three guitarists in the Beatles (and Mick Taylor was better than almost anyone else alive at the time) and Mick Jagger is the greatest front man in rock and roll history. Innovation Nobody touches the Beatles for musical groundbreakingness (which isn't a word but I refuse to correct it). They broke new territory constantly and tore up rule books left right and centre. The Stones followed in their wake as they took music in new directions. Longevity Obviously the Stones have the edge here. The Beatles had (roughly) a decade, the Stones had five decades. And while it's clear their later albums aren't as great as their earlier ones, they're still recording good music and putting on amazing live shows. Albums The Beatles were the most consistent album band of all time. Every LP they released (I'm talking about the UK catalogue, not the US catalog which isn't nearly as good) was at worst fantastic and at best exceptional. There isn't a dud in their repertoire. The Stones on the other hand had long stretches where they released albums that just weren't worth hearing more than once. But they had a golden run for a while Beggars Banquet, Let it Bleed, Sticky Fingers and Exile on Main Street are four of the best rock and roll albums ever recorded. Nobody has ever managed to match that run of hits. Live performances The Stones have the edge again. The Beatles were good in Hamburg and the Cavern but from all reports Pete Best held them back. The Stones were really ripping up everywhere they played and making jaws drop in their early days. Once both bands became huge, the Beatles shows quickly became half-hearted affairs drowned out by audience screaming and then they stopped performing altogether. The Stones put on some of the greatest concerts rock and roll has ever seen. The Mick Taylor Era shows were just outstanding and a lucky audience in Brussells got to witness Rock's finest hour. Even fifty years after they began, the Stones are still putting on great shows and they're still a brilliant live act. Rock interpretations In their early days, both bands brought the rock and roll greats to a white audience. Both their early albums are full of Chuck Berry covers and there are lots of other crossovers between their two repertoires. Songs like Carol - let us compare both bands playing the same track. It appeared on the Stones debut album and was played by the Beatles at the BBC. Harrison can't quite nail the riff and The Beatles struggle to make the track work. The Stones absolutely nail it and produce the best version of Carol anyone has ever played ever. Songwriting. The number of hits that both bands produced is absolutely staggering. No other bands have as many outright classic hits in their catalogue as The Stones and The Beatles. It's no exaggeration to say that both acts have 100 original songs each which are just brilliant. The difference between the two is that The Beatles recorded their 100 in seven years, while the Stones have taken fifty. Which one is better? Neither. They're both great, they're both streets ahead of everyone else and they're both essential to the sound of modern music. But if you held me down and demanded I choose one or the other, I would pick The Stones mainly because of their live shows. The Beatles released some great albums, some interesting Anthology collections and two sets of BBC performances which are fun but not essential. And that's pretty much it. But the Stones have been performing for 50 years and broadcasting their shows on radio, TV and lately webcasting from time to time. As a result there are dozens and dozens of exceptional quality bootlegs from their entire career. I've got lots of great quality shows and listen to them often. The Taylor era stuff is just superb but even the later shows contain some brilliant Jagger Swagger and Richards riffage. I've got 50+ versions of Jumping Jack Flash but every one sounds fresh and new and not a single performance sounds phoned in. The Beatles and Stones could both write great songs, but only the Stones added an extra 20% of brilliance in a live setting. It just gives them the edge for me. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no answer to this one, it's the wrong question. It's like asking if Jesus is better than Mohammed. Both bands were products of the same era and in thrall to the same influences. They are the Ying and the Yang of popular music. The Beatles were working class scousers, who before those watershed years of 1962/1963, when both bands had their first hit singles, had honed their skills over many years playing together, famously in their residencies in Hamburg and the Cavern club in Liverpool. By 1963 they were already local celebrities and ready to take on the world. The Stones were from similar backgrounds, although a bit more middle class and art schooly than the Beatles. Their rise was quicker, and they followed slightly in the wake of the Beatles first couple of hit singles. But they had still paid their dues, playing the pubs and clubs of South London and the home counties. Both were influenced by being from port cities. The Stones with their proximity to London and the Beatles in Liverpool. This gave them access to imported American singles. Specifically Blues, Gospel and Rock and Roll records. They listened to the likes of Little Walter, Ma Rainey, Howlin wolf and Muddy Waters. This was absorbed on top of Rock and Roll heroes such as Elvis, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Fats Domino and Chuck Berry. Then throw in the solely British phenomenon of Skiffle, which became very popular in the late fifties, and had a DIY attitude to it, very similar to Punk 20 years later. Add the fact that Britain circa 1962 was a nation still recovering from the war, with rationing not long ended and a drab conservative hierarchy still dominant, and you have the heady brew from which the Beatles and the Stones both sprang. It's hard today to underestimate the seismic influence on popular culture of both bands. The Beatles and the Stones invented the Pop / Rock band. Drummer, bass, lead guitar, rhythm guitar, singer. This was a blueprint for what constitutes a Pop / Rock band and was laid down by the Beatles and the Stones. Heavily influenced by their Blues playing heroes, but still, not the staple make up of a chart topping artist until the Beatles and the Stones came along. They wrote their own music. Initially both bands played some covers, the Beatles more open in attribution, the Stones less so. But by the mid sixties both were writing and playing only their own music and Jagger/Richards and Lennon/McCartney had become the songwriting geniuses we know them as today. The fact they are products of such similar backgrounds and influences makes the differences in their music all the more interesting. Almost like a Darwinian tree you can trace Pop music through the Beatles and Rock music through the Stones. Lots of crossovers yes, but the Stones were heavier and darker and much more likely to frighten your Granny than the Beatles. Rhythms and attitude where what distinguished the Stones from the Beatles. This heavily influenced 70s Rock, Zeppelin and then Punk. The Beatles had tunes and melodies and were much more likely to have your Granny humming along than to a Stones record. The Beatles were likeable lads, down to earth and much like the people buying their records. Through all their experimental brilliance Lennon/McCartney never stopped writing good tunes. That's why you'll find school choirs singing Beatles songs and not Stones songs. The Beatles invented the Pop band and are the blueprint for the modern Pop band. Jagger was different. A strutting androgynous total front man. When you watch the Stones your eyes are fixed on Jagger, he plays no instrument, just him and his unique mock American, yet authentically his, voice. Richards provides the riffs and the atmosphere. The Stones are blusier than the Beatles and are the blueprint for the modern Rock band. My roundabout answer to your question is that both are two sides of the same coin. One can never be better than the other as both have an equally profound influence on popular culture. Popular music today would be radically different if the Beatles and the Stones had not existed. Saying one is better than the other is impossible. ",
