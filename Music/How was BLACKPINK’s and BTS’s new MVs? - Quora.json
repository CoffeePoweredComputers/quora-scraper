            "answer_text": "I really enjoyed blackpink new music video, like YASSSS badasss energyyyy. But bts less\u2026. It's been many years since I've been a dedicated army (meaning I knew everything there was on the internet about them, there wasn't any video or any article or anything that I didn't know or that I didn't saw) but recently I've been less committed to them because I feel like there are not as passionate as before. In the sense that when they reacted to black swan (the dance performance) they didn't know it was filmed. And sometimes I just don't feel like they connect with the music they do (sometimes) and also I was hoping bts would have talked more about the BLM movement,and when I say talk I don't mean a tweet, I mean a personal thing, I want to hear THEIR Opinion (personally frop each member). I'm scared that bts are just becoming something commercial. I still really like bts, I'm not sure if I'm obsessed/in love with them anymore tbh, but I hope things are going to change. ",
