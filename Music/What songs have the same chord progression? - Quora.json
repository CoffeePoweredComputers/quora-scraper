            "answer_text": "a number of standards in the bebop era were written based on chord changes of swing period tunes usually considered \u2018great american songbook\u2019, originating from theatrical or film scores. the songs were significantly altered otherwise, and gave the actual composer potential royalties from publishing or recording, whereas improvising over the original would have diverted those royalties to the copyright owners. it was done consciously as a cost saver. there are two jazz standards whose common basis is fairly obvious to the ear, \u2018Misty\u2019 and \u2018I want to talk about You\u2019. the latter was a regular number for the Eckstine band, who employed Sarah Vaughan when she was starting out and featured players who were becoming the vanguards of bebop, a huge mutual influence on all concerned, while \u2018Misty\u2019 later became one of Vaughan\u2019s most popular numbers.
