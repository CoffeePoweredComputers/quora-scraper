            "answer_text": "TL; DR: Seriously? If you want to toolder this, then I am sorry, but you don't have the attention span to listen to longest songs. So, go on scroll for snappy content. INTRODUCTION:Firstly, calling it a long song is misnomer and I guess it is technically correct to refer them as \"epic songs\" or something else, I'll post a question on that and edit this answer.  You might have noticed I digressed off the constraint defined i.e. song and shifted my focus to any kind of music even computer generated ones. This is because I am assuming the ask-er meant any musical composition when he meant longest songs. Here you go:   This is Dream Theater's \"The Count of Tuscany\" from the album \"Black Clouds and Silver Linings\" which is my best longest song* from Dream Theater. Also pertaining to the question, I referred to it as a long song, but long song is misnomer and it is technically correct to refer them as \"epic songs\".     You can also check out:      1. A change of seasons      2. Octavarium (23:00)      3. Home Porcupine Tree - From The Sky Moves Sideways (two parts that add up to 35 minutes).  Pink Floyd did have their fair share of epic song, off the Atom Heart Mother (23:00) Not really a song, more of an instrumental.Shine on you crazy diamond (2 parts totaling 46 mins)One of these days (21:00) etc.Jethro Tull's \"Thick as a Brick\" (40 mins)  also deserves a mention, because well it is one of my favorite..but due to my attention span (or rather the lack of it) I have only listened (i.e.completely) to it twice.Also check out \"A Passion Play\" which is another 40+ epic.Manowar's \"Achilles, Agony and Ecstasy in Eight Parts\" is 28:38 Green Carnation's  \"Light of Day, Day of Darkness\" (60:06)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longplayer\u200e : The longest piece of computer generated music created by  Jem Finer is being recorded. It has been recording for the last 11 years. It is due to end in 2999 and will restart on that date. \"The Chosen Priest and Apostle of Infinite Space\" by Bull of Heaven: More than 2 months long. They are also credited with a song that is 50 000 hours in length. But it is to be noted that Bull of Heaven does not write actual music but repeats sound effects at very slow speeds for days. But if I may have the liberty to include instrumentals then this bizarre composition by John Cage must be the longest ever:As Slow as Possible You can have a listen to it here: News - John-Cage-Orgelprojekt HalberstadtAlthough mostly it is silent.  Other honorary mentions:Mars Volta's Cassandra Gemini (33 mins)Also some symphonies by \"Beethoven\" are very long.",

            "answer_text": " Tubular Bells, by Mike Oldfield is the first to come to mind. At 48:54 it is either hypnotic or nerve racking.   Echoes by Pink Floyd off the \u2018Meddle\u2019 album was my next thought, but it only clocks in at 23:35.   Foreigner by Cat Stevens as unsettling as it is for me (having bottomed out while listening to it) came to mind next, and surprisingly lasts only 18:36.It seems I\u2019m sliding downhill.   In A Gadda Da Vida, by Iron Butterfly is next to pop up in my drug-riddled mind. Lesser still, at 17:03. (That translates to 1:30:00 on acid)   Alice\u2019s Restaurant Massacree, by Arlo Guthrie, at 18:34, is a given when considering long songs. (Considered by us old hippies, of course) Here\u2019s Arlo performing in 2005, thirty-six years after composing it.   Billy the Mountain, by Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention.The full 40:00 version recorded live at the Pauley Pavillion. This classic adventure into insanity epitomized the drug culture of my youth._____________________________________________________________________________  Mountain Jam, by The Allman Brothers Band At Fillmore East 1971.(yes, I know, another version appeared on \u2018Eat A Peach\u2019, but at 34:04 this one is a full 25 seconds longer!) These are the longest songs I can think of off the top of my head, in the order that they toppled off my head. Yes I know there are longer ones and there was music after the \u201870\u2019s, but not this kind of music. For all the generational influences this music had for me, there is one in a totally different genre which surpasses even these iconic masterpieces. When it comes to long \u2018songs\u2019 , for me the winner is:__________________________________________________________________________________  Also Sprach Zarathustra, by Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra (composer- Richard Strauss) This was not just any long-hair music, this was a symphony for the ages. I would play the record over and over until I could whistle practically the entire thing from memory. And at 32:40, that was quite a feat indeed. All other versions are inferior. Trust me. You recognize the overture from the film 2001: A Space Odyssey. The above link is a mere 5 minutes, all that you tube would give up. The mere sight of the album cover releases memories of musical bliss.  Edit: I was just reminded by Alexander Fortier of the ultimate longest song.How I could have forgotten this one is beyond me! The song that never ends.  10 hours !!! Actually 10:12:39. Have fun listening to this whole thing! ",
