            "answer_text": "While all Kpop artists are affectionate with their fans it can be argued that BTS is the most affectionate. The reason for that is that there are many ways to show affection and BTS\u2019s label doesn\u2019t keep them on a short leash. If members want to write a song for ARMYs they are free to do so. If members have some free time and want to go live, make a quick video or something to interact and show their fans something, like how they\u2019re doing or to ask how ARMYs are doing they are free to do that as well. I don\u2019t think other groups don\u2019t care as much, I just believe that the labels keep them on such a short leash. So I will say BTS definitely between these two but this doesn\u2019t mean I think BP cares any less about Blinks than BTS cares about ARMYs. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it depends really. K-pop in general is known for its surprising amount of fan interactions. BTS definitely comes across as more affectionate at fan meetings, but that could be because (often) most fans at fan meetings are female so it might be easier to be attentive to them. They can hold their hands and joke around with a lot less awkwardness than Blackpink would. They\u2019re also known to give their fans stuff like a bag or an accessory at a concert if they can. However, I\u2019ve seen a lot of Blackpink interactions with fans that are also pretty great. They bake them cookies and give them small gifts. It\u2019s hard to compare fan interactions between boy groups and girl groups. ",
