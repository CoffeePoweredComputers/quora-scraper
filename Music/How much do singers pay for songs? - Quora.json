            "answer_text": "There are multiple possible answers to this question. I am a retired folk singer. I\u2019ve recorded multiple albums, so I\u2019ve got some insight into several aspects covered in this question. When PERFORMING,. the royalties are not my problem. they are the venue\u2019s concern. They generally pay a blanket fee to ASCAP or one of the other rights organizations.They also pay a fee for \u201ccanned\u201d music. The tunes you hear in the background at your favorite watering hole are paid for out of that. For RECORDING, you purchase reproduction rights. These are based on projected sales. The same applies to streaming. Typically, these are about $0.009/copy. (That may not be accurate,. It\u2019s been a while since I did any recording, so my data may be out of date and/or inaccurate.) When someone buys the rights to record or use your original material, the rates are similar. I\u2019ve made a few bucks that way, too. If the singer is outright buying the song, that rates are flexible, and set by the composer. Often a song written by a band member is \u201cfree\u201d to the band. The writer may ask for larger piece of sales on that basis, though. This has actually broken up a few bands. I\u2019ve sold a couple of originals, too. One of them I literally gave away. I wrote a song supporting the Scottish referendum on breaking away from the UK and gave it to the SNP. I don\u2019t know that they ever did anything with it, but I did give it to them. Lest anyone get the idea that I\u2019m some kind of \u201cname,\u201d I\u2019m not. I\u2019m a small time performer that managed to make enough out of my hobby to pay for the equipment. Though I\u2019ve retired from that line, I still get some earnings, mostly from streaming. Anyone that\u2019s interested can hear my recordings. I\u201dm \u201cout there\u201d on all the usual places: Youtube, iTunes, etc. Look for DruidSong. Or, links to places where you can listen to and/or buy may stuff can be found at DruidSong (NOTE: this is not intended as a commercial plug. I\u2019m not here to sell stuff.) ",
