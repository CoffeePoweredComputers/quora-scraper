            "answer_text": "There are a lot of elements involved in becoming a good piano player. Manual dexterity is in the mix, obviously. Some people have finer motor control than others. Musical memory plays a bigger role than it gets credit for. If you remember everything that you learn, you will advance much faster than if you forget most of it, and have to repeat things many times. Exceptionally good pianists also have kick-ass memories, whatever genre they\u2019re playing in. Exceptional musicians of any type will acquire and retain music very fast. Phil Collins tells the story of getting into Genesis - he arrived while other drummers were auditioning, and he learned all of the music while floating in the backyard pool and was ready to play the music with understanding, not just a beat. It was somewhat the same for Steve Vai, who could store Zappa\u2019s complex music in memory, and then transcribe it. All professional soloists can sit there and play complex and technically difficult music for hours, purely from memory, and if they want to illustrate a musical point they will start playing snatches of practically anything they\u2019ve ever studied. Most of us struggle to commit Fur Elise reliably to memory, and neat little licks and ideas we work out are forgotten again before they\u2019re used. We forget the fingering we just worked out minutes ago, and the chord pattern evaporates as soon as we stop looking at it. Simply retaining what you just learned is huge. Then there\u2019s time. Exceptional musicians have an exceptional awareness of time. Whatever neurological clock takes care of that function is more accurate, in them. Even if you\u2019re playing more or less correctly, rhythmically, it\u2019s very different if the rhythm is in the pocket. Music comes alive in relation to time. What makes an amateur playing something quite simple and slow different from a professional, is - along with a few other things - time. The talented player\u2019s notes sound so much better because they\u2019re music not notes, and what makes them musical is the better player\u2019s subtle and confident sense of time. Then of course there\u2019s pitch sense and proprioceptive or haptic memory. I put them together, because knowing where you want to go is pitch sense, loosely speaking, and then actually getting there physically, requires exquisite feedback from your muscles and joints. Good players are accurate. Some people throw errors faster than others. Golfers say they get \u201cthe yips\u201d when some little kinesthetic sequence develops a bug, and they just can\u2019t stop slicing it, or over-hitting putts, or whatever. It\u2019s a kind of a tic, I suppose. Many people simply can\u2019t shake a shaker in rhythm for very long before they trip over themselves. They can\u2019t repeat something over and over without tics or stammers creeping in. They make random errors. So, those are some of the things that separate the musicians from the uwashed masses. Of course you can improve in this or that area with work, but depending on what you\u2019re working with, \u201cbetter\u201d still isn\u2019t necessarily that great. I have thought about all of this because I am an intriguingly bad musician, and have wondered \u201cWhy am I so bad at piano?\u201d Only it\u2019s more like 50 years. I\u2019m quite bad at chess also, which doesn\u2019t much trouble me because when you get better at chess, you just get beaten up by a better class of loser. You hit 1800, and some 2100 FM eats your lunch. You get to 2200 and some 2500 IM kicks sand in your face. You get to a fearsome 2600 and become a GM, and Hikaru Nakamura holds your face underwater and all the girls around the swimming pool laugh at you when you emerge coughing and sputtering. So I might as well just win and lose among cafeteria-level players. I feel similarly about the piano. I\u2019m not very good, but I\u2019m not competing with anyone. I am good enough to entertain and interest myself, which is quite enough. I get gradually better. I\u2019m about as good now as a 6 year old Japanese girl. If just about everyone died in some thrilling apocalypse, and a little cluster of survivors began to group together, maybe 200 people, I could well be the greatest pianist on Earth. It\u2019s all relative. So if you can work out a way to satisfy yourself musically, it doesn\u2019t so much matter how good you are. ",

            "answer_text": "I feel you on this\u2014I\u2019ve been playing for almost 20 years and I\u2019m still mediocre at best\u2014but I have to disagree with everyone who\u2019s saying you can only be good at it by being born with a natural talent for it. Some people find it easier to pick up on certain things than others, but when it comes to the level of true mastery, the person who started off as a \u201cborn natural\u201d is going to have to put in just as much work as the person who didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t have particularly agile fingers and I tend to second-guess myself, which is why I consider myself mediocre, but I absolutely do not believe that it would be impossible for me to overcome these difficulties by investing in real, high-level piano lessons with a real master who would drill me the right way, give me suggestions, and force me to let go of lazy or \u201ccheat-y\u201d habits (I probably have a bunch that are ultimately hindering my progress even though they seem easier upfront\u2014and that\u2019s the thing, I just don\u2019t have the expertise or motivation to recognize and fix them on my own). And I fully believe the same would be true for anyone else. I imagine something similar is going on for you. I probably won\u2019t end up making that investment at this point in my life, since I don\u2019t really have enough disposable income and I\u2019m okay with just playing casually for now, but if you think it would be worth it to make the investment, I highly doubt you\u2019ll find it impossible to make more progress. Lessons like that don\u2019t come cheap, though. ",
