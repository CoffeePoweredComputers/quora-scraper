            "answer_text": "That depends on what you mean by \u201cmusic theory\u201d. As a musician myself, I have noticed that laypersons (non-musicians) tend to group all musical knowledge under the \u201cmusic theory\u201d umbrella, which is not the way musicians themselves think of it. Freddie Mercury took piano lessons as a child, and played in a lot of different bands as a teen. He claimed to \u201cbarely read music\u201d but he obviously knew what chords and keys were, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have been able to compose the pieces he did, with wild modulations and tons of chords, some of which were medium complex (not just major and minor triads). Now, as for the term \u201cstudy\u201d. He probably learned the names of the notes, how to read treble and bass clef, basic rhythms, scales, keys, and chords. He probably didn\u2019t go on to advanced studies in music theory, which is how musicians think of theory. The other stuff is just basics, most musicians know this, and I doubt Freddie was an exception, even if he didn\u2019t have to read or notate much music. ",
