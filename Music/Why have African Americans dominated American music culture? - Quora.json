            "answer_text": "We haven't. People are just jealous and if they see one of us succeed they inflate the number to hundreds mentally. This twisted perception allows a person to justify denying others Black people opportunity saying the area is \u201csaturated\u201d with Black people. And, or you're looking at one or two genres only. If you look at just rap and r&b it might appear our presence is sufficient because there are SOME black people who sing in these categories. There are also many whites, latins, Asians, mixed race who succeed here as well. So Black people don't \u201c dominate\u201d. However if you look at country, Country, Blue grass, pop, rock, jazz, alternative , Rock, Punk, metal, classical, easy listening, Broadway there are NO Black people represented. Zero , zip, ziltch..okay maybe a few but far less than compared to non black Americans in R& B and rap. I would like for Black Americans to be more successful and visible across all genres of musics in America and abroad. After all, foreigners like Drake, Justin Bieber, 21 savage and k Pop are famous here. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a fairly long-winded historical answer to this question, but I\u2019ll try to keep it brief. If you consider all the forms of popular music you can think of, in other words, almost everything except Western Art Music (\u2018classic\u2019 concert music), you would see that these styles have their origins in the traumatic historical event called the slave trade. From the 16th to the 19th century, 12 million slaves were brought on ships from West Africa to North and South America and the Caribbean. Four million were brought to North America, and eight million to South America and the Caribbean. Slave traders often went to New Orleans where they traded or re-sold slaves. New Orleans already had a mixed population of Spanish, French and English, and classical musical forms were present there. Slaves intermingled with whites there and some learned to play classical instruments and music. Slave owners in the North did not permit their slaves to build instruments, but took them to church in hopes of instilling a spirit of submission in their slaves. There, the slaves heard and sang hymns. Due to the absence of instruments, slaves developed \u2018work songs\u2019 to help them complete their often repetitive tasks. The work songs had a repetitive structure about them. Many other songs were simply sad, mournful and the theme was one of loss. Out of this combination of work songs and hymns, the Blues was born. Over time, the Blues gave rise to practically all following styles in popular music: Jazz, Gospel, Rock n Roll, R&B (rhythm & blues), Funk, Soul, Motown, and others. (Hip Hop /Rap does not really have a clear Blues element in it). In South America and the Caribbean, which had been occupied predominantly by Spain and Portugal and was therefore Catholic, slaves were permitted to build instruments such as those they had used for music making in their homelands. Catholics were also more relaxed about slaves maintaining their spirituality, and soon, different mixtures of Catholicism and African tribal spirituality arose (syncretism). From this, we get all of the great Cuban and Brazilian music (Bossa Nova, Samba) based on a vast array of percussion instruments and grooves. So if you are familiar with the great guitarist Carlos Santana (Mexico) and subsequently the pop music of Camila Cabello (Cuba) and Shakira (Colombia), these are examples of the influence of South American music originally from Africa in popular music. It\u2019s ironically possible that if the slave trade hadn\u2019t occurred, the only popular music we would know is Country and Western (Irish influence) and whatever arose out of concert music, such as some broadway musicals. There is far more to answering this than what I have done but I hope it\u2019s a start for you. ",
