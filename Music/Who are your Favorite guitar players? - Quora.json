            "answer_text": "Wonderful arbitrary question! I have a number of favorites, some who influenced my formative years as a musician, some who still inspire me, and certainly some that I don\u2019t emulate but listen to and enjoy immensely. Here\u2019s a sampling, in no significant order (except that the first ones in my head are probably the \u201cmost favorite\u201d). Some are \u201cduos.\u201d Randy Rhoads (Ozzy)Steve Vai (David Lee Roth, Frank Zappa, Whitesnake, solo)Adrian Smith/Dave Murray (Iron Maiden)Synyster Gates (Brian Haner Jr - Avenged Sevenfold)Adam Dutkeiwitz (Killswitch Engage)Stevie Ray VaughnMatt Heafy/Corey Beaulieau (Trivium)Joe SatrianiJohn Petrucci (Dream Theater, mostly older stuff)Zakk Wylde (the Ozzy years - not the solo/BLS stuff so much)Frank Hannon/Tommy Skeoch (Tesla - HUGE formative influence!)Warren DeMartini (Ratt)Criss Oliva (Savatage)Nuno Bettencourt (Extreme)David Gilmour (Pink Floyd)James Hetfield (Metallica - not a Kirk fan)Marty Friedman (Megadeth)Paul Gilbert (solo and Mr. Big)Andy Timmons (solo and Danger Danger in the 90s)Mark Tremonti (Tremonti, Alter Bridge, Creed not so much)Mark Knopfler (Dire Straits, solo)Tom Keifer (Cinderella)Keith Douglas (Tora Tora)Diamond Darrell Abbott (Pantera)Richie Sambora (Bon Jovi, yeah, I said it - Richie is fantastic)George Lynch (Lynch Mob, Dokken)Michael Wilton (Queeensryche)Brad PaisleyEVHJeff Waters (Annihilator)That\u2019s a lot. Part of the reason is that if you want to be a good and relatively unique musician, you need a LOT of incluences - the more the better. ",

            "answer_text": "1- Angus/Malcolm Young In my opinion, the two greatest guitarists to have ever graced the instrument. I\u2019m personally a huge fan of Angus\u2019s style as a lead guitar player (his solos are a perfect mix of blues, rock, and Angus\u2019s electric playing style), and I doubt that there are too many people who would disagree with naming Malcolm Young as one of the best Rhythym guitarists ever. Listen to the solo in the demo version of \u201cIf you want blood\u201d and the solo in \u201cLive Wire\u201d for some of Angus\u2019s best work 2- Vivian Campbell His work on the first two Dio albums is just amazing. His tone isn't the best but the passion he plays with makes up for it in spades. I also really like how he phrases his solos. They all have a very unique mix of shredding and traditional hard rock/blues playing. Take the solo in \u201cHoly Diver\u201d for instance; It starts with a very moderately paced, bluesy lick that works up to frantic end. Very unique. 3- Marty Friedman His guitar work in Megadeth is legendary. I really like his unconventional playing style and sound and he has written some of the most recognizable solos in metal history. Tornado of Souls is probably his most recognizable, though they're all great 4- Adrian Smith Adrian and Dave Murray are one of the most famous duo\u2019s in metal history. I personally prefer Adrian\u2019s bluesy style to Dave\u2019s legato style, but regardless, Adrian is a master composer. Listen to \u201cWasted Years\u201d or his amazing solo in \u201cCaught Somewhere in Time\u201d to hear some of his best work 5- Roy Z I\u2019m going to take an unconvetional route here and go with Roy Z as my last pick. While I\u2019m no fan of his work with Tribe of Gypsies, his work on Bruce Dickinson\u2019s solo albums are some of the best riffs ever written. His style, while not particularly unique, fits well to Bruce\u2019s vocals and his composition skills are top notch. Listen to the main riffs in \u201cTyranny of Souls\u201d\u2026 Actually just listen to the albums \u201cTyranny of Souls\u201d and \u201cThe Chemical Wedding\u201d as well as the track \u201cRoad to Hell\u201d off of \u201cAccident of Birth\u201d to hear some of the finest riffs ever written-it\u2019s worth your time. Also listen to his solo on \u201cTears of the Dragon\u201d. HONORABLE MENTIONS: Randy Rhoads, Carlos Cavaso (for Metal Health and Condition: Critical), Chris DeGarmo, Warren DeMartini, Erik Turner, Brad Paisley, Phil Collen/Steve Clark, George Lynch, Glenn Tipton, Dave Mustaine, Frank Hannon ",
