            "answer_text": "I don't know about other people but i am gonna confess how i found lyrics for my first song. You can check it here:  So it's more about emotions and less about thinking what to write. I started with major chord to give it a happy feel and then i ended up with progression. While playing the chords i started to think of a friend who i had kind of breakup with. I wrote this song for her. These are the things i wanted to tell her or ask her. \u201cWas it that tough to say sorry?\u201d Signifying she chose her attitude instead of our friendship. To write something, i would suggest you to go deep into your heart and find a memory or a confession or something that's worth telling. Lyrics aren't written from hands. I am sure you will be able to write good songs from heart. ",

            "answer_text": "I can not speak for all writers. I can only say what I have noticed about songs I have heard and how I personally use that info to write the songs I would like. It starts from an idea that the sound embodies within the song. What is this sound, what does it mean to you, and how is that as a whole going to be communicated with the audience. I like to be very methodical with writing so I find metaphors and similes, alliteration, onomatopoeia, and other complex grammar to compose only ideas related to the sound. Then I take the best of each of those ideas and rework them into a track. I find a main theme and I model a chorus around it. I use sound patterns as well as word alternation and rhyme schemes to make the entirety o the track interesting. The most important thing besides the technicality of any of this, is the inspiration of the sound. Using emotion, I find what I think others are going to find emotional about the sound. Once I relate to that, I write a track! Eminem has it figured out though.  ",
