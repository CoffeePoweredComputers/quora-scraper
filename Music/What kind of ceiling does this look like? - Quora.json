            "answer_text": "You appear to have a gypsum plastered ceiling, likely over wood or expanded wire mesh lath, which was originally wallpapered over the unpainted plaster, likely several times over, and then sprayed with plaster as a popcorn ceiling, and then painted. This condition is not unusual in 19th and early 20th century homes. Eventually, fashion dictates a painted ceiling, and later the wallpaper starts to go. The popcorn texture goes on to hide the failing wallpaper. It looks like the sort of failure you have from water saturating the ceiling from above. That water, soaking the wheat paste holding the base wallpaper layer to the plaster has given way. The good news is, that if the underlying plaster is still well attached and stable, the top layers can be scraped off and the plaster repaired or overlaid with gypsum board. ",

            "answer_text": "It looks to me that the ceiling was \u201clathe and plaster\u201d which has been painted initially. Then it looks covered with lining paper and then a paper called annaglypta which is a heavy paper. It would have been painted over following installation. After a period the seal caused by the paper would have allowed the initial plaster to absorb moisture, the repetative drying out causing the cracks which would allow plaster to fall out. ",
