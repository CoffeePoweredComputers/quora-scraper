            "answer_text": "It depends on your budget. Usually licensing music for web is cheaper than acquiring the rights for TV. If you know which specific song or track you would like to use you should contact the publisher of the track directly so you get a quote for licensing.  Another way to do it is through royalty free music libraries.  Rights for licensing music for Web start as low as 30 usd per track. Also, keep in mind that even if you need a specific track that could be very expensive to license, you can also go for a \"sound alike\" track through royalty free music libraries.  Hope this helps ",

            "answer_text": "If you need a specific piece of music, something well known will require you to get in contact with an agent who can facilitate clearance for you. They will have the contacts and know who to talk to and negotiate sync rights pricing.  Alternatively, if you have a general idea of a style of music you want to use it is far simpler and cheaper to license and download a piece of music already cleared for web use such as: http://www.ambientmusicgarden.com/royalty-free/music-for-websites.html ",
