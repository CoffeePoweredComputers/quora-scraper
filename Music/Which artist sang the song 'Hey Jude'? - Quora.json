            "answer_text": "Hey Jude is a song written by BeaTle, Paul McCartney. He wrote it while on a ride to fello BeaTle, John Lennon\u2019s House. John was divorcing his wife Cynthia and Paul wrote it as a soothing message to their son, Julian. But rather than sing \u201cHey Jules,\u201d he instead chose to disguise it as \u201cHey Jude.\u201d There is a Line in the song that Paul wanted to change. \u201dThe \u2018movement\u2019 you need is on your shoulder.\u201d Saying to John, \u201cI have to change that. I meant to say \u2018mo-ment!\u2019\u201d To which John replied \u201cYou WON\u2019T, you know! That\u2019s the best line in the bloody song! And there you have it. It may have been serendipity, but it is now a line that has been famously sung for fifty years! A little trivia- A line that snuck past the censors. Toward the end of the song, in the line where Paul sings \u201cRemember\u2026 to let her under your skin. Ah\u2026\u201d Paul hit a wrong chord on the piano and said \u201cFuckin\u2019 Hell!\u201d Although they tried to bury it as best they could in the piano track, it is there and you can hear it. ",
