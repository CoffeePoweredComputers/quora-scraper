            "answer_text": "There are a number of people that EC likes and respects. He was quoted in a 1985 Guitar Player Magazine: Saying that he had begun to think Jeff Beck was the finest guitar player he had ever seen. He loved several of the great blues players from the 30\u2019s through 90\u2019s, with Big Bill Broonzy being the first to get his interest, but Robert Johnson is the one that really shook his cage. B.B King, Albert King, Freddy King, Otis Rush and Buddy Guy all had a tremendous influence on him, and he loved their playing. Eric has a tremendous friendship with Carlos Santana, and I\u2019ve read that he thinks Carlos is the most spiritual player. He stated in an interview somewhere last year that John Mayer is a master guitar player, which really blew Mayer\u2019s mind I\u2019m sure. Derek Trucks and Albert Lee are guys that have played in his band at various times, and Eric has tremendous respect for them as well. There are probably others, but those are key in his development over the years. ",

            "answer_text": "it's always been BB King and Freddie King Duane Allman along with Jimi Hendrix to an extent Jeff Beck back in the day between The Yardbirds and cream. Eric is always paid lots of compliments to many axe players. I should edit and add a few because there's been through the years he always talks about fantastic guitarists.. Stevie Ray Vaughan he spoke highly of, also in an interview not too long ago he also mentioned who was the greatest guitar player he said Prince.. and of course George H. always enjoyed each other but he didn't really talk about George as far as a fantastic guitarist but more as a friend.
