            "answer_text": "Since other people have given the obvious answer, I'm going to go the other route and assume you mean physical pain like I had. Turns out I was an incredibly anxious child growing up (family issues, always in trouble, insecurities, etc) and everything took a toll on my body. Every time I found myself in a deeply emotional place like a moving song, a friend who hurt me, or even a girl who dumped me, my heart would hurt like someone literally stabbed me. One physically painful moment that felt like something pierced my heart. Turns out it was anxiety and something I needed to work on over time. I no longer get these pains, but it's always a good reminder that if we dwell on negativity too much instead of letting things go, our bodies can seriously suffer from it. Had I been 50 and out of shape instead of 17 and healthy as can be, I'm sure my anxiety would have driven me towards a heart attack. I'm sure you're just fine, but this may be a sign that you have an issue with anxiety that needs to be dealt with. ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing is wrong with you, good music gives relief and relaxation or listening to emotional music activates some special glands which are responsible for hormone secretion. You feel some songs deeply, from the bottom of your heart because you may have special memories linked with them, they might be associated with a special event of your life or maybe they convey a deep meaning which is beautifully represented in the forms of a song and you understand it. Yes and songs make one cry, If you understand and feel them because some songs are mood relaxants yet others are responsible for effecting one\u2019s emotions (without harming) and that's just natural that you develop obsession for some song and start listening to it over and over again; more specifically because its your type, your life story or you can relate to it. So it makes you emotional as you develop special feelings for that song. ",
