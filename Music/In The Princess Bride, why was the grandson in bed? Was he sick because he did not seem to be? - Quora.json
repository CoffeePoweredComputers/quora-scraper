            "answer_text": "In the book, Goldman pretends he is telling something that actually happened to him. But it is fictional. The family he has in the book is not the family he had in real life. In the book, he remembers that when he was a child, he had a fever that is so high, he got delusional about trying to listen to some baseball game on the radio, even though he had been told there was no game that day. In the book, Goldman, as a kid, isn't interested in books, only sports. His father, an immigrant and very old country, decides to entertain his bedridden son by reading him \u201cTHE PRINCESS BRIDE,\u201d which is the kid's first introduction to romantic fantasy. This was too much backstory for a film, so they made the kid contemporary. They still wanted to keep the reader an old country immigrant, so they made him a grandfather. A father would not have been old fashioned enough at the time the film was made. But the kid is still sick Not as sick in the film as he was in the book. Read the book. The film is great, but the book is better. ",

            "answer_text": "The Grandson is sick in bed. He coughs at the start of the film. Then the Grandfather says both: \u201cHey! How\u2019s the sickie? Heh?\u201d And later, \u201cIt was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father, and today, I'm gonna read it to you.\u201d So it\u2019s heavily implied that the Grandson is sick but we\u2019re not told what illness he has. The Grandson also does cough before the Grandfather comes in, but doesn\u2019t keep coughing through the film, though to be fair that would be really distracting and might cause us to throw popcorn at the screen. In the book, there\u2019s no Grandson, just a disconnected father-son pair, so we can\u2019t rely on that to give us answers, and the screenplay doesn\u2019t tell us. There\u2019s an interesting thought here: Grief, Fathers, and The Princess Bride on whether the Father is in fact dead, and the Grandfather is attempting to help the Grandson through his grief. I don\u2019t think so, but it\u2019s an interesting thought. ",
