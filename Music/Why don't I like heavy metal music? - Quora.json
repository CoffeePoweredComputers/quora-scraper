            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a free world inside your mind. You can like any music you like, and it doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t like heavy metal. (That said, I had to work once in an office which piped in elevator music, stuff that had no substance at all, just cliches, and I hungered and thirsted for real music when I got home). But as to why. Most people\u2019s why centers on their upbringing. If (besides nursery rhymes and traditional songs) you had H/M in your house, chances are you would have deep tracks in your brain about it, and even if you went to a Polynesian island and played ukelele for ten years, the H/M would resurface the minute you heard it back in the States. Music, even crashy-bangy music, is highly organized, and it penetrates deep into your psyche, or your amygdala, or whatever you call \u201cyou.\u201d Still, every person is unique. Some people just don\u2019t like noisy music. My dad was a big-band, light-classical entertainer, so I heard lots of it - parties with friends, the ball park, etc. He also saw to it we had classical lessons, and made tapes of all sorts of music - he believed in having a wide range of interests. So I adjusted easily - UNTIL I heard 60\u2019s rock. Whanga whanga whanga whanga houn\u2019 dog, cry-in all the tahm whanga whanga whanga. About that time, I discovered Bach, and forgot about listening to the radio and its tiresome, repetitive stuff, and went for a world of color and light and rhythm, which I found in this 300-year-old music. Explanation: Genetics? Upbringing? School? or did I just simply like one kind of music, and not another? If you have a social desire to appreciate (that\u2019s what musicians call it - you can take classes in Music Appreciation in college) a certain kind of music that feels dull or obnoxious, there is a measure of listening to it a lot, and finding common ground with music you like. After graduation with a master\u2019s in classical organ performance, I became a piano teacher, which involved very simple music - and I began to appreciate simple music - the amazing thing of writing a piece that is a half-minute long and is simply gorgeous. Harder to do that writing a big piece. I also became the main musician for a country-style church - thud clap thud clap thud clap rhythm. I found the lyrics were easier to ear in their style, and enjoyed the crisp, definite harmonies, and the smiles of the people when I did their music the right way. I heard some rap music, and was turned off by the obscene, filthy lyrics - but then I heard other groups with listenable lyrics and began to appreciate the ins and outs of this strange form of poetry, and even wrote a Christmas Rap. It can be a joy get up close and personal with music, and suddenly discovering what caused somebody to write in a particular style. I still don\u2019t go for Armenian throat-singing, but the performers obviously do, and maybe some day I will. ",

            "answer_text": "You might be starting off wrong. The main misconception about metal is that it\u2019s just noise and takes no talent, while in reality, it\u2019s one of the most talent driven genres out there. Heavy Metal is also a vast genre, it doesn\u2019t only include Metallica, or those death metal bands who scream their guts out, there are a lot of \u201csofter\u201d metal bands I guess you could say if you first heard it. Since metal is super vast, I would be surprised if someone listened through every genre and never found one song they liked. When I first got into metal, I thought Death Metal was just pure garbage and had zero talent. Of course, at that time I was a glam metal fan, (hehe). Until I got into heavier bands, such as Metallica, Exodus, Megadeth, Iron Maiden, and the big 4 thrash guys as well as British Heavy Metal. I started off slow and my ear got used to the sound that metal so proudly presents. In no time, a friend of mine showed me a couple of death metal songs, and even though I still don\u2019t prefer it, I now see the immense talent and dedication it takes. The growling may seem like something frogs can do, but no, it\u2019s a field of music which takes multiple years to even get \u201cgood\u201d at. So in my opinion, open your mind to the vast genres that are out there, and start with the ones you like. Now, I\u2019m just assuming you\u2019re gonna like Glam, like mostly everyone else, since it\u2019s the most commercial friendly and easiest to listen to.    I know those aren\u2019t the vastest songs out there, but it\u2019s a good place to start. Van Halen is a great band I find with people who are getting into metal.  Just look through all of the genres metal has to offer, look up playlists on youtube and progress your mind further into it. You\u2019ll find ones you hate, and the ones you love. heavy metal genre chart It may seem tedious at first, but you can always google any of this stuff. Personally, I\u2019m going to say the most friendly way to be introduced into metal is by Glam metal, and then working your way into more Old School Heavy metal bands, like Iron Maiden, Motorhead, and Judas Priest. Then, maybe Thrash metal, bands like Overkill, Exodus, Megadeth and Slayer. Then you can progress further and further into Black Metal even. I\u2019m not saying you HAVE to be a death metal fan, but it\u2019s good to see if you\u2019ll ever like it, because it may change your life like it has with many others. Hey, you may even like Power Metal, something the COMPLETE opposite of what you would think metal is. And if you just CANT get into metal at all, start listening to classic rock songs. Bands such as ACDC, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, The Eagles, ZZ Top, and even KISS can set you in the mood. Again, it all depends\u2026 If all else fails, just listen to Metallica. ",
