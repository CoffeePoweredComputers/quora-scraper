            "answer_text": "A computer extends your ability in three extremely important ways. MEMORY \u2014 once committed to memory, a computer preserves whatever it once knew in a permanent form. Contrast that with human memory, where we can easily forget only hours later what we were thinking about, and might be fuzzy on the details for something that was once very clear to us. And though computers can fail just as we can (such as human dementia), a computer has a wonderful advantage over human beings, in that it can transmit a perfect copy of what it knows to another computer. Compare this to a parent or teacher trying to pass on what he or she knows to a younger person. A perfect example is a person who wants to write a memoir. Yes, you could write it on paper but that is a very fragile medium which can be damaged or destroyed far too easily, and is hard to copy without having it on a computer. ENHANCED REACH \u2014 similar to how a lever works, a computer can extend your impact on the world to multiply by many times what you can do by yourself. A perfect example is Quora itself. It allows one person to communicate with hundreds or thousands, or even millions. Likewise, it allows you to buy products from stores with no local presence in your community, send money to pay bills or deposit checks without leaving your house, and stay in touch with loved ones no matter where they are in the world. For many people who do not need an in-office presence, it allows them to live anywhere in the world they want, as long as they have access to a network. SEARCH \u2014 the ability to ask questions, research a topic, learn something new, or try to find someone you wish to be with (virtually or in real life) is unmatched. There is no equivalent power available to the common person. A computer opens a world that in very recent times was denied to those with an active interest in the world and a hunger to learn. When I was a boy, many years ago, I had a hunger to learn about everything, and communicate with a wider community than the small desert town in which I lived. That hunger was essentially stymied, left to crawl along by reading books and going to school. And while both are excellent things to do, many of my questions in my youth went unanswered. Today, give me 5 minutes in front of a computer and I can get multiple high-quality answers on just about anything, learn just about anything on YouTube with pictures taking me step-by-step through a task, and I get to use the equivalent of power tools such as Excel or FileMaker (a database) to manipulate information on my computer. It\u2019s a wonderful world now that computers are in it. ",
