            "answer_text": "Good question, this is gonna be a long one. A few reasons. 1.THE GODDAMN STANS!! i have never seen a fandom so trashy before. They obsess over idols and refuse to see the dark truths behind the industry. They are delusional to the fact that BTS does plastic surgery even though they advertise ppl to \u201clove yourself\u201d when clearly they aren\u2019t doing that.2.THE TRASH MUSIC I\u2019ve heard utter trash music before (new Selena Gomez songs) but nothing will compare to Jennie\u2019s SOLO. AND EVERY SINGLE SONG IS A CARBON COPY OF IT! It\u2019s repetitive and it\u2019s made for sex appeal not quality. Why else would the fanbase be drooling about the people dancing instead if the songs itself? The lyrics are bad, they\u2019re not even deep. I won\u2019t point the argument that we can\u2019t understand the lyrics (because i listen to jpop) at least jpop has better lyrics than kpop.3. THE LACK OF RESPECT FANS HAVE i come from the anime community and i can tell you that the kpop fandom is the most disrespectful fandom I\u2019ve ever seen. Worse than Fortnite and yes, worse than anime. The toxicity levels in the kpop fandoms are like anime waifu wars times 1000. Picture this, you\u2019re at home browsing through social media and Kobe Bryant has just passed away (RIP love you Mamba) suddenly someone on twitter posts a fancam of Blackpink saying \u201cKobe wouldn\u2019t have died if he\u2019d stanned Loona\u201d. WHAT FUCKING DISRESPECT IS THAT?? Do y\u2019all have any respect for tragedies like the Kyoto Animation fire or Kobe Bryant dying? Maybe even Etika? What kind if Devil spawn would think up of such a thing?4. DICTATORSHIP AGENCIES I know quite a bit on this because i have kpopper friends. The agencies are dictators. According to Tiffany Young, they pushed her so damn hard that even \u201cbreak\u201d was reading scripts fir radio shows. Like, you\u2019re pushing teenage boys and girls that are not even legal, to perform onstage, do sexy moves that are borderline perverse and exposing them to rapists and pedos? Worse is that they barely have any contact with their family and their school friends. AND FANS CHOOSE TO DENY THIS!!!in summary, i am disgusted with this fandom. The world is better of without kpop as a genre. Edit: there is proof that they have done plastic surgery in case you guys were wondering: The K-Pop Plastic Surgery Obsession ",

Yup, totally not stereotyping a genre and totally not generalizing an entire age group. oMfG sAraNghAe mE opPar1!11!11  tHe iDoLs alL hAve pLaStiC sUrGeRy, sO thEy\u2019Re FaKeOf course, 100% of all South Koreans have gotten plastic surgery. And undoubtedly, that is a bad evil thing since celebrities doing whatever they want with their bodies because they have the money and availability of good surgeons is morally and ethically wrong. But then again, when American celebs get it, it\u2019s totally fine because at least they\u2019re \u201chot.\u201d  tHe maLes LoOk FemInIne\u2026says the guy who doesn\u2019t accept the fact that people have different music preferences and then goes, \u201cwHy can\u2019t I gEt a giRlfRieNd.\u201d I wonder why. I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s because you can\u2019t acknowledge that Eastern Asians have different beauty standards than Westerners?  tHey\u2019Re aLl gAyOh really? Last time I checked, most Koreans are prejudiced and traditional, so they\u2019re heavily against the LGBT community. You really think they would accept a gay idol without cursing them out on social media? And since when was \u201cgay\u201d an insult?  tHeY weAr mAkeUpok and?  cRiNgeY yELlOw cOiN sLot EyEs. sTuPid cHiNg cHongS tHat eAt dOgs\u2026 Eating dogs is illegal in a lot of parts of Asia now. Do your research before you accuse a whole race of eating d o g s. And since you\u2019re the expert on Asians all of a sudden, might as well remember that ch*nk is a slur while you\u2019re at it.  tHeY aLl LoOk The SaMetheIr mUsIc and DaNciNg sUckS.

But yEs, I acknowledge that Stan Twitter is fucked up and full of delulus who say \u201cmAyBe hE wOuLd bE aLive if hE sTanNed LooNa.\u201d We all take full responsibility for not being able to tell them to stop since we obviously have full control over what others do, and we also take the blame for obsessive fanwars and crazy stans who make up 25% of our species. But then again, generalizing millions of K-pop fans based off a social media platform and cursing them out is also toxic beheavior-  - - - - - - - Ayo remember all these memes you got sent by your \u201cfriends\u201d as a \u201cjoke\u201d all the time? They be calling me a crazy delulu but sends me these. The hypocrisy is amazing-           But then again:  - - - - - - - Pfftt, the amount of upvotes some hate answers have on here is disgusting. Imagine taking the time out of your life to curse out a genre of music just because you disapprove of it. K bai hoes.     tehe ",
