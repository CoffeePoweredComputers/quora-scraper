            "answer_text": "In 1979 I purchased an Ovation Active Electronic Ovation Deluxe Preacher Guitar. It was supposed to compete with the top of the line Gibson Les Paul and it certainly had all the jewelry and American Made. The pickups could be switched from twin to single coil and they were hot as hell and could really sustain. The Ovation was the first active electric pickups, (battery powered) and extremely low noise. Unfortunately even at give away prices Ovation Electric Guitars just did not sell. However, EMG came along and decided to design and manufacture Silent Pickups for Fender Guitars, probably a great idea. Fender single coil pickups were notorious for their hum, buzz, and hiss. I recorded an original song for my son\u2019s wedding and the sound engineer had two or three filters plus computer software to get rid of the hum from my Strat. The EMG-S are single coil pickups the \u201cS\u201d designates single coil. Many players like Eric Clapton only play the traditional Strat Pickups and this is true for many of the greats. EMG pickups do not have the full range of tone however they sell lots of these pickups and players who use them like them. It is all about getting used to the tone of the guitar you play. I play Epiphone Rivieras with P-90 Single Coil pickups for the last 9 years and I am used to the tone they produce. I play both in church and a Blues Band. The advantage of the Single Coil is that their natural sound is low and high frequency tones but shallow mid frequency tone. Hence, in church my electric guitar does not cover the full frequency of acoustic guitars. In the Blues band it works well with the lead guitar player using a twin coil pickups. You can purchase a used fender pickup picard complete with 3 EMG pickups for around $250-$350. So this is not cheap. I have not seen many fenders at Guitar Center with EMG pickups so it is hard to get a sense of the tone. Once you install these it will take some time to get used to them so it is your choice. Yes they will hum a lot less and you will not need to place your hand over the strings between songs or use your guitar pedal to get the annoying hum to go away between songs when not playing. Check out youtube videos as this may give you some vital information about a decision to change. ",
