However Pete could have written a book,made tv appearances there's plenty documentaries and films about his period though he ironically ended up working as a taxman. Happy ending because he deported himself with grace he made money off the anthology and other recordings he played on ,hard not to feel for him though the Beatles made the right choice as a drummer and a personality Ringos a class act.
