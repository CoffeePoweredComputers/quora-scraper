            "answer_text": "Apple Music, Beats, Spotify, Rhapsody, YouTube\u2014all streaming, but nobody actually buys a song. What's up with that? Well, every so often in between songs, an ad will play telling you to eat at this restaurant, or whatever the ad is for. These ads generate MORE THAN YOU\u2019D THINK. Along the lines o f$0.40/ad, but in the range of 10\u201380 cents. (Spotify made like $2 billion or something like that in 2016.) The other way Apple Music gets paid is from subscribers. $10/month per subscription. So how do the bands get that money? When Someone plays their song, the get money. But it's probably LESS THAN YOU\u2019D THINK. It's $0.005 cents per play. ON TOP OF THAT, the service that got the band onto Spotify will take 7\u201312% of their earnings. (It is difficult to get people on Spotify without using a service like CD Baby or Ditto.) Here\u2019s how I've seen it work. So I own a record label. And I have a band I signed who on Spotify (also pays $0.005/play) that just reached 6,000,000 Spotify plays just 2 days ago. I paid for their album to be recorded, for physical CDs and Vinyl records to be burned and pressed, and I got them onto 80+ online stores like Apple Music and Spotify. So I take 10% of all revenue. Let's look at how much the band makes: 6,000,000 \u00d7 0.005 = 30,000 so this band has made &30,000 in the past 9 months, just on Spotify. That is their most successful platform, but they still made a good amount on all other streaming platforms. I took 10 percent so the band really only made $27,000 (thus far) and I made $3,000 as their label. $27,000, and they make about $2,000 per show. Do you think this is their full time job? It\u2019s not; just throwing that out there. Also taxes have to be paid. If you aren't paying taxes, you'll get in trouble. This is taxable income, so depending on how much you make a year, it can be different per band member (since one band member could be a doctor and the other could work at McDonald's). Keep in mind, most labels keep 30\u201360 percent of the revenue. I've seen the number 49% used in record labels recently and it's a way to make the band feel like they're in power when they aren't. The average musician who gets onto a streaming platform (Apple is harder than spotify) will not get over 5,000 plays ($25), so here are a couple of tips to help you get more streams: Make playlist on streaming platforms with local bands. You will kind of merge your fanbases.Play shows. Plug your Spotify or whatever at your show.Create links for people to click and put them on all your social platforms. Spotify has an option where you can create like a QR code (but don't use those because QR codes are not a good marketing strategy).Don't stress about it too much. You are only getting $0.005 per play\u2026. you'd probably make more money per hour at your job than trying to promote your Apple Music profile. And you can use the money you make to promote yourself properly, e.g., with Facebook ads.I basically summed it all up. I highly suggest you get ISRC codes if you don't have a label (this is what Billboard uses to track sales) and don't ever stop. You can't make money being a musician if you aren't one yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "In general, a record label pays the artist and Apple pays the record label. While some artists can do direct sales with Apple, that's not how it works. How much and how often an artist makes money on Apple Music depends on their contract with their label. This is how you can see artists railing against Apple Music and streaming services even as their music is in a streaming service. If they signed a contract that allowed the label to sell their music on a streaming service, the label has a right to do it and they really have no choice except to renegotiate their contracts with the label when the opportunity arises.  Since each contract is different, Apple pays a different amount depending on the song and the artist. During the 3 month free trial, that is a flat amount per stream. After the trial, each time a song streams, the pre-agreed amount is paid to the label. They pay the amount to the record label that then, depending on their contract with the artist, pays them a portion of that. In reality, it tends to be a very small percentage. This is how it works with all streaming services. The artists don't like it because the label takes most of the money and the streaming services don't like it because the label takes most of the money as well. Apple is able to leverage their influence and relationships and make money, but companies like Spotify and Pandora, as well as Tidal and the now defunct Rdio, struggle to make money at all.  ",
