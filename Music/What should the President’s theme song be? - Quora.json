            "answer_text": "Please, listen to the best song ever written about Trump. The artist did not consciously write it as a protest about Trump, but the song says it all! It is extremely appropriate and to the point! Do not only listen to the song! Get the lyrics on Youtube and read the lyrics while the song is being performed! It is Anastacia\u2019s hit song: \u201cLeft outside alone\u201d. This is the ultimate song about Trump. It is astonishing, mind blowing, mind boggling, stupefying, dumbfounding! Listen to it and read the lyrics! And listen to it with all victims of the Government shutdown in mind! I DEDICATE THIS SONG TO ALL OF THEM! Let\u2019s hope there will not be a second Government shutdown on 2/15. Please listen to the song, if only to pay homage to the more than a million people who were victimised by the shutdown! I love you Anastacia! Greetings, Robert. ",
