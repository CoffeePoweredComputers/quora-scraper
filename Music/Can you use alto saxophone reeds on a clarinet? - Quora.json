            "answer_text": "Alto saxophone reeds will work on an alto clarinet. Soprano sax reeds work on soprano clarinets but they\u2019re not ideal. Clarinet reeds are cut to have more wood in the center of the reed, they are intentionally made that way to make them a little more resonant and less thin and bright. They would work a little better for jazz but technically, reeds are designed for the optimum performance for each instrument. A soprano sax reed can work but it\u2019s not the right cut and also clarinet reeds tend to be longer than soprano reeds. One exception I\u2019ve experienced is that I have used Legere \u201cEuropean Cut\u201d Clarinet synthetic reeds on a soprano sax and actually prefer them to their soprano cut, and I think it\u2019s for the same reason, I like a fat sound on the soprano and the European cut seems to have a fuller, warmer sound and it seemed to resonate more than their standard soprano sax cut. Also, Plaz Johnson, the saxophone player who played the well known solo on \u201cThe Pink Panther\u201d said he used baritone saxophone reeds on his tenor saxophone, so trying different cuts is something you can experiment with. It certainly worked for him! You can see a live version of him playing Pink Panther on this youtube video. He\u2019s got a big fat and unique sound and that baritone reed was one of the secrets of his sound.  ",

            "answer_text": "Answer by Rick Rossi is good. It is a few years since I\u2019ve actually played the alto sax, and many years since I played the clarinet (although I did once play the Mozart clarinet quintet with a real string quartet at a public concert so I do feel a bt qualified). On alto sax, I used to use tenor sax reeds all the time. That was fine, somehow I got a better sound. Not sure about using alto sax reeds on a clarinet though as I never tried it. For what it\u2019s worth, the best reeds I ever tried for clarinet were Rico Plasticover reeds, which were clarinet reeds with some kind of black plastic coating, don\u2019t think they make them any more, probably haven\u2019t for years. But yes, experiment, give it a go, things may or may not work. Cheers, Phil ",

            "answer_text": "No; not a usual Bb soprano clarinet, which is probably what you mean when you say \u201cclarinet.\u201d An alto sax reed will fit on an alto clarinet, a tenor sax reed will fit a bass clarinet, and a Bari sax reed will work on a contra alto clarinet though. Soprano sax and soprano clarinet reeds are pretty similar and should work ok in a pinch. ",
