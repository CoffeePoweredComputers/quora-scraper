            "answer_text": "Whether this piece is a \u201csong\u201d or \u201cmodern\u201d is up for debate, but my favorite piece of music written and performed in the last one hundred years is unquestionably Milton Babbitt\u2019s \u201cPhilomel\u201d (1964). (Listen to part I here: Milton Babbitt - Philomel ) \u201cPhilomel\u201d is a 20 minute long cantata for soprano, accompanied by a recorded voice track and synthesizer. The text is by poet John Hollander and is a poetic expansion upon the moment of transformation of the Greek mythological figure Philomel as the gods turn her into a bird. Escaping the evil Tirius, who had cut out her tongue, she regains her voice and communes with nature. Milton Babbitt is known for his early pioneering work in electronic music, and his lifelong commitment to the extremely complex and unabashedly academic twelve-tone system of atonal music developed in the first quarter of the twentieth century by the Second Viennese School. Both are well on display in \u201cPhilomel,\u201d his most well known work\u2014Babbitt creates a vivid world of sounds and textures in the synthesizer that call to mind the three dimensional soundscape of a forest abuzz with life along with a deeply allegorical use of echo. Meanwhile, the pitch structure contains many different forms of Babbitt\u2019s increasingly complicated serialist structure. Milton Babbitt dared to write music in which the listener is the virtuoso. And while \u201cPhilomel\u201d is nearly impossible to perform for sopranos, it truly is the listener who has the hardest time\u2014so much as hearing a hint of the complex tonal relationships throughout the work require months and months of strenuous analysis!
