            "answer_text": "Every Major scale has the following formula: Whole - Whole - Half - Whole - Whole - Whole - Half Two whole steps, followed by 1 half step, followed by 3 whole steps, followed by 1 half step. Whole step between 1 and 2 Whole step between 2 and 3 Half step between 3 and 4 Whole step between 4 and 5 Whole step between 5 and 6 Whole step between 6 and 7 Half step between 7 and 8 Take a look at the piano keys, so you\u2019ll know what half steps and whole steps are like between notes.  So to build the F Major scale, let\u2019s start on F (the 1st note of F Major scale). Go up a whole step from F, and you\u2019re at G (the 2nd note). Go up a whole step from G, and you\u2019re at A (the 3rd note) Go up a HALF step from A, and you\u2019re at B-FLAT (the 4th note) Go up a whole step from B-flat, and you\u2019re at C (the 5th note) Go up a whole step from C, and you\u2019re at D (the 6th note) Go up a whole step from D, and you\u2019re at E (the 7th note) Go up a half step from E, and you\u2019re at F (the 8th note \u2014 the 1st note of the next octave). So the scale is: F, G, A, Bb, C, D, E, F. Now Bb has another name: A#. But why is the 4th note called Bb and not A#? Because the 3rd note of the F Major scale is already A, so if you put A# as the 4th note, you will have two notes with A\u2019s, which is not allowed. You have to use each of the seven letters exactly once: no repeating letters, no skipping letters. Since the 3rd note is A, the fourth note has to have B in its name, adding the correct accidentals if necessary, therefore it\u2019s B-flat (Bb). So F, G, A, A#, C, D, E, F is NOT correct. It is supposed to be F, G, A, Bb, C, D, E, F. There actually IS such a scale with F-G-A-B-C-D-E-F with a B natural, it\u2019s called F Lydian, which is F Major but with a raised 4th (where the B flat becomes B natural). F Lydian is also the 4th mode of C Major, because F is the 4th degree of C Major, and F Lydian and C Major share the same notes. ",

            "answer_text": "Major scales have a consistent format. They are created in terms of whole steps and 1/2 steps. On the guitar, a whole step is a two fret distance, a 1/2 step is a one fret distance. A major scale is made up of two four note structures called tetra chords. A tetra chord is a four note scale. The tetra chord starts with a 1 note, there are three whole steps and one 1/2 step for each of the two tetra chords. Don\u2019t let the statements overwhelm you. The diagram below will make things quite clear. For the F major scale note names and numbers: 1F, 2G, 3A, 4Bb, // 5C, 6D, 7E, 8F // The F, G, A, Bb sequence is the first tetra chord. The 3A to the 4Bb is a 1/2 step or one fret apart. The C, D, E, F sequence is the second tetra chord. The 7E to 8F note is one 1/2 step. I have found it practical to use the labels of the tetra chords using three, 1\u2019s and one, 1/2 Here is the short hand version: 1, 1, 1, 1/2 (skip a fret) then 1, 1, 1, 1/2. The start note is a 1, it leads into the tetra chord form. // 1, 1, 1, 1/2 skip a fret/ 1, 1, 1, 1/2// The // 1, 1, 1, 1/2 // 1, 1, 1, 1/2// is a model for all the major scales. you can jot down the note names of the scale, identify them in terms of two tetra chords and observe the 1/2 step between the 3rd whole tone and the 1/2 step that complete each tetra chord. It may seem a bit tricky but if you run through it a few times you will have found a great resource. Just remember to skip a fret between tetra chords for the major scale only. Once you have a handle on the tetra chord concept of the major scale things will come much more easily for you. The major scale which contains the tetra chord is the source of the modes that are derived from the scale. You can use each note of the major scale and count out the eight notes to create each mode. The modes have their own tetra chords and the skip a fret nuance of the major scale does not always apply to the different modes. All you have to do is to recognize the two four note tetra chords to make learning the modes easier. If you are adventurous, you can use the major scale format for all the keys and extract the modes accordingly. You don\u2019t have do this all at once. If you take your time, you can blend in the new scales gradually while you focus on other elements of music. P.S. Each mode creates a chord also. Good luck! ",
