            "answer_text": "What?!! No, no, no, no! Not too late at ALL!! [By the way, I admit, I just answered this same Q for a 24-year old, so I\u2019m \u201cplagiarizing\u201d myself somewhat\u2014but not entirely, because that 8-year difference between you and the [also really great] 24-year-old may be of some importance in all this.]  This adult student is really great\u2014and older than 16! [as, well, all adults are] Kiddo, what\u2019s up? Okay, let\u2019s do this: I\u2019m a [very \u201cyoung\u201d\u2014young-seeming <chuckle>] mid-40s person, and I\u2019m \u201cfit\u201d and all\u2014I do my running and swimming\u2014but I\u2019ve NEVER learned to snow-board, which I\u2019ve really wanted to do since my mid-20s. Do you think it\u2019s too late for this old granny-person [um, I\u2019ve no grandkid really], sitting here typing, with my ancient mind wandering over, now and then, to ponder, \u201cHey, just WHEN will I get a senior\u2019s citizen discount at the movies and for my swimming pass and all?\u2014that\u2019ll be great!\u201d \u2014 oh, sorry, Young Person, where was I? Oh\u2014do you think it\u2019s too late for me, right in my mid-40s, to learn how to snow-board? [Answer key: No.] Just make sure you\u2019re going to be taught [piano . . . . . not snow-boarding\u2014well, maybe snow-boarding, too, but I don\u2019t have a clue about that one yet] by someone who\u2019s very experienced teaching folks your age, because you may be pretty miserable if you don\u2019t take this advice\u2014like you might feel ridiculous if you\u2019re assigned things like Variations on \u2018Twinkle, Twinkle,\u201d or you may get someone who pulls some \u201cadult piano method\u201d book out, and you\u2019ll be learning inane arrangements of stuff from, like, old musicals and\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014the Beach Boys or whoever. If you wish to play very casually, it may really not make a huge difference about how you go about learning\u2014except you\u2019ll learn much more quickly/efficiently and *well* from a [real\u2014not video-taped or \u201conline\u201d] teacher who you\u2019re quite sure knows what s/he\u2019s doing. As for your progress, you older \u201ckids\u201d [sorry if you hate being called that\u2014it\u2019s just that your prefrontal cortext (in your brain) hasn\u2019t developed nearly as much as it should to be an \u201cadult\u201d yet\u2014that happens around age 25\u2014really]\u2014ANYway, older kids [\u201cadolescents\u201d] and young adults progress FAR more quickly than the younger kiddos do, particularly at first, because you will (most likely!) be better able to focus mindfully during your lessons, and you\u2019ll better understand what you\u2019re instructor could possibly be talking about! And, you\u2019ll have more diligence to practice *in a way that will lead to quicker learning of your pieces*. (A lot of younger kids think that sitting down and just \u201cplaying through\u201d stuff is good-enough practice, but you\u2019ll know better. Just be sure to get a good teacher who will teach you this stuff.) That said, you\u2019ll have to wait a bit\u2014maybe 8-10 years\u2014before you go applying to Yale School of Music or Julliard or CCM (Cincinnati) or any such place. And, if you want that, you\u2019ll really have to work it, Aspiring Pianist! But, hey\u2014if that\u2019s what you\u2019d love to do, do it. Get to it without delay, my young friend! Let me say, that sight-reading will likely always be more difficult for you than for younger-starting pianists. It just has to do with how the way the brain works\u2014you know, all that stuff about \u201cdevelopmental stages\u201d and all. SO, for mostly this reason, when you get to a solid intermediate level\u2014and that may take as little as three years, give or take\u2014anyway, you\u2019ll very likely find that, then, you can\u2019t keep up with the learning pace of someone who started reading music before s/he started reading words. Regardless of whether you start tomorrow or \u201csometime down the road,\u201d in order to get to the point where you\u2019re able to play, say, virtually anything by Brahms\u2014or, like, for example, what I was playing last night, Mussorgsky\u2019s Pictures at an Exhibition\u2014you\u2019ll likely find it starts becoming a little more \u201cslow-going.\u201d But, hey, a lot of the Mozart sonatas\u2014beautiful works\u2014you can get to, without too much frustration if you\u2019re really serious! Let\u2019s say you don\u2019t want to go to some great conservatory/put-off-college-for- seven-or-eight-years: Okay. And, still, it would not surprise me a bit if, eventually, you get to the point (if it means a lot to you) where you could be quite skilled and become a recitalist or do chamber music with string (or other) players of your same general level. And, hey, playing that \u201creally hard\u201d stuff I mentioned above somewhere, may mean nothing much at all to you\u2014and that\u2019s completely understandable, because there\u2019s TONS of literature that isn\u2019t so difficult, but that\u2019s absolutely beautiful. So, for example, I\u2019d say, depending on your time and motivation, you could play those beautiful pieces by Erik Satie\u2014his Gymnop\u00e9dies and Gnossiennes\u2014check those out on YouTube or whatnot\u2014by perhaps your late-third year. And those are very REAL pieces! I played the Gnossiennes a few years ago, right along with Debussy\u2019s Suite Bergamasque and\u2014hmm\u2014-SOMEthing by Ravel that I can\u2019t think of right at this moment. If you\u2019re more interested in pop \u201csheet music\u201d and stuff, that will take not much time at all to learn. Go right for it, without doubt. (It\u2019s just not my \u201cthing\u201d at all, but who cares, I say.) Okay\u2014and if you\u2019re not able to get those lessons anytime soon, don\u2019t fret. Like, sometimes I [yes, a bit oddly, but it\u2019s true], think, \u201cWow\u2014wouldn\u2019t it be great to have become a really cool graphic designer?!\u201d So, if those piano lessons never, ever happened, I\u2019d have found something I could enjoy a lot. And. so, you go forth and get those piano lessons whenever you can (and if possible, try not to wait much longer, okay?)\u2014and if that doesn\u2019t work out, just BE who you are, doing whatever you find that you can and that you can enjoy. (As long as it\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t hurt anyone \u2014 including you). Okay, sorry for the [really-typical-of-me] lengthy answer. Well, it\u2019s good bedtime reading, as it will put you right to sleep! Sending you my best hopes! \u2014Poppy Anth\u00f3polos ",

            "answer_text": "BEST13 EFFECTIVELY METHODS TO LEARN PIANO.. Question: #Is 16 too old to start learning music piano. Let me share best piano tips as below, I hope you enjoy it. 1. Set goals Know what you want to accomplish as a piano player. Do you want to perform for a special event, play for your own enjoyment, or learn a favorite song? Have a clear goal in mind of why you want to learn to play the piano. It will help keep you focused and motivated as well as give you something to work toward. 2. The Miyagi Technique The #1 technique for piano beginners is something Zack likes to call his Miyagi Technique, named after the infamous Mr. Miyagi on The Karate Kid. Using Zack\u2019s technique, you\u2019ll accomplish smoother tone, faster playing, and injury prevention. It\u2019s one of the best warmup exercises for piano newbies and involves learning how to press each key to get the result you\u2019re looking for. 3. Find a teacher There are plenty of online tutorials to help you teach yourself, but it is always good to have a teacher. Meeting regularly with a teacher can help you reach your goals and be accountable. It\u2019s a good idea to have a support system of people encouraging you as you learn a new skill. Useful post: Top 10 frree and paid piano courses online 4. Learn the basics It\u2019s important to start with the basics. If you don\u2019t already know how to read music or the fundamentals of playing the piano, take time to learn notes, rhythm, scales, proper posture, and other basic skills. Failing to learn correct habits and good piano-playing practices now will hold you back later on. 5. Find music you enjoy playing Many people think that they must start by playing classical music. That is not always the case. If you want to play for fun and enjoyment, start with songs that you like. Pop songs are great to start with because they often have simple melodies and tunes that are easy to pick up. The key to enjoying playing the piano is to find music you enjoy learning to play. It will motivate you to keep learning, and it will be rewarding to successfully play a familiar tune. 6. Take it one step at a time It takes time to get used to playing a new instrument. Have patience with yourself if you can\u2019t master a song as fast as you would like to. Keep trying and don\u2019t give up. Start with songs that are at your current level and gradually challenge yourself to play harder songs as you progress. Know your limits, and pick songs that are at your level or slightly above your level. Don\u2019t try to play a song that is too advanced. Don\u2019t rush yourself\u2014set a pace that you can maintain and that fits with your goals. 7. Be willing to make mistakes Mistakes are a part of learning. Don\u2019t feel embarrassed if you make mistakes or if a song or skill is difficult for you to learn. Most piano teachers don\u2019t mind if you make mistakes because it shows you are trying. They want to help you improve. When you make mistakes, it helps them understand what you are struggling with and how they can help you. 8. Celebrate improvements Remember where you started and celebrate your improvements, no matter how small. When you see the progress you\u2019ve made, you will be more inclined to continue. When you\u2019ve mastered a song or skill that was difficult, celebrate that accomplishment. Even if you aren\u2019t a perfect pianist after taking lessons, you will be better and more knowledgeable than you were before you started. 9. Have fun Enjoy learning and doing something new. Having enthusiasm for learning is more important than having talent. You may not be a concert pianist or go on to perform in Carnegie Hall, but if you have fun playing and enjoy learning new songs, that will make your effort worth it. 10. Start now Don\u2019t procrastinate learning to play the piano for another day. If you wait for the ideal time to start, it will never come. You are never too old to learn to play the piano, but you\u2019ll never learn unless you decide to start. 11. Make practicing a priority If you don\u2019t schedule a specific time to practice each day, you may find at the end of the day that you don\u2019t have time to practice. If you want to learn to play the piano, commit yourself to applying what you learn and practicing regularly. Consistent practice in short sessions of time is better than practicing a lot all at once\u2014for example, practicing every day for 30 minutes is more effective than practicing once a week for two hours. If you can, try to stick to a routine so practicing becomes a habit. As you practice, vary your techniques and the songs you play. This will keep you from getting bored and make practicing enjoyable. 12.\tPlaying Expressively Another distinct advantage that adults have over children is their desire to play piano expressively- something most kids don\u2019t even remotely understand. While kids can learn to mimic the expressive qualities of a musical piece, only an adult can pour their emotions into a piece of music to effectively transfer emotion to the listener. You can learn to play more expressively using best piano tips resources. Dive into our free tips for learning piano and spend as much time as is possible practicing the techniques you\u2019ll learn on our website, and you\u2019ll discover something amazing happening over time- you will become the piano player you\u2019ve always dreamed of being. Sign up for our free online piano course or get started now. 13.Practice slowly to avoid mistakes. Your brain will remember mistakes faster when you have an emotional outburst (\u201cArghhh, no\u201d). Rather practice slowly and feed your brain the correct information, then give it positive affirmation like \u201cYeahhh, I\u2019m a piano genius!\u201d 14. Make a schedule to practice piano each week, start out with 15 minutes every other day (Though I bet it will turn out to be at least 30 once you start playing!) and work your way up to practicing every day! By setting easy goals, you can avoid associating practising piano with \u201cpressure\u201d or discomfort. Besides, your to-do list is long enough already. Playing piano should be the fun part of your week!And now you can add your piano practicing goals to a Google Calendar, which automatically finds the time to schedule your goals. 15. Be comfortable playing the piano piece before you move on to the next challenge. Learn to play the piece in time. Also try to play the piece by heart; that\u2019s the best indication that you\u2019re more than ready for the next song. Plus you\u2019ll impress your listeners by not needing a musical score in front of you and hear them say, \u201cWow, he really IS a piano genius\u201d. ",
