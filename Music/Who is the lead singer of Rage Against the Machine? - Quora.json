            "answer_text": "Easy it's Zack de la Rocha, American born but of Mexican decent. He grew up on a lot of punk music and even formed a hardcore band called Inside Out. It was actually Zack who came up with the name Rage Against the Machine as it was originally going to be the name of his next album with Inside Out but unfortunately his hardcore band broke up and thought the name would fit with Rage's music. His political views and overall views on the world came from combination of the punk music he grew up on, his general upbringing and the many books he read up on. He met Tom Morello(guitarist) and started jamming with him after his hardcore band broke up. Though Tom Morello had no really knowledge on punk and was more into funk metal they we're united by their agreement on their extreme political views and as a result they agreed on writing politically charged music. But yeah to keep it simple it's Zack De La Rocha hope that helped ",
