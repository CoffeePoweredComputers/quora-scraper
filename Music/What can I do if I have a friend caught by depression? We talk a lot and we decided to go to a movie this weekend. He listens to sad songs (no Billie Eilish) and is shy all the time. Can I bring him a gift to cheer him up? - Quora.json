            "answer_text": "You are such a good friend with a big heart to care like this for your friend. Talking about uplifting subjects and getting him out is probably the best thing you can do for him right now. When I get caught up in my own feelings/problems I call it my \u201cPoor Poor Me Syndrome\u201d and what I do is try to get out and do something for others. Maybe in seeing those things that others are having to suffer through in life, he will see that his life is not as bad as he thought. Seeing what others are going through can make you more grateful for what you have. If you get out and see that there are ways that you can help make a big difference in your community it can be life-changing in giving you joy that you have been missing out on in your life. Donating some time to a local charity like the Samaritan Center or Big Brother & Big Sister Programs, or your local hospital, or maybe volunteering on some projects through your church will bring even more joy into your life. It just seems like the more you give, the more you receive. I am a believer in the Universal Law of Attraction, which is the belief that by focusing on positive or negative thoughts people can bring positive or negative experiences into their life. So in other words if you focus your day on positive things, like helping others, you receive positive- if you focus on the negative you receive negative into your life. Praying he will soon find what will put some joy in his life and those around him and that he can start making a difference in his community by helping others through their problems. ",

            "answer_text": "The best gift to give him is the gift of you. Be there for him. Make sure he knows that someone cares. Show him affection. Make him feel loved. Make him feel like he has something to live for and that life can be happy and not always depressing. Let him know that you\u2019ll always have his back. Let him know that he\u2019s not going to go through things alone and that you\u2019ll be there with him. Spend time with him. Live in the moment with him. I had a friend who was extremely depressed and he told me that whenever we talked about nothing for hours on end, or texted about the strangest things, or even when I would just say \u201chi\u201d to him, it made him feel like he had someone to live for and now he\u2019s doing a whole lot better. He told me that just talking to me about things helped a lot because I was always there to listen and talk through it with him. I never made him go through anything alone and I always had his back so just listen. And let him know he\u2019s not alone because he isn\u2019t. I wish you the best. ",
