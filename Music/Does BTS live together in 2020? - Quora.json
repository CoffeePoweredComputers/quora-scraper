            "answer_text": "Yes and No You see, all the members excluding Namjoon and Jimin have their apartments. This could be a mere investment but it isn\u2019t. -We have seen Taehyung\u2019s apartment \u201cFrom all the photos he posts on weverse\u201d, and it doesn\u2019t look like their dorm or even his parents\u2019 house -Hoseok\u2019s case is practically the same, we have seen photos of his own apartment from where he lives and it doesn\u2019t look like their dorm as well -Jungkook has his own apartment which is in the same building as Hoseok\u2019s \u201cAlso confirmed\u201d -Jin had his own but he recently gave it to his parents, but I assume he has another one but that the media is clueless about That leaves Yoongi, Jimin and Namjoon -Jimin bought an old luxurious house, but, it needs a lot of maintenance, therefore Jimin is still at BTS\u2019s dorm -There\u2019s no information about Yoongi\u2019s own apartment or house but if you read between the lines you will get it, he has his own apartment too -I will be honest tho, I have no idea about Namjoon, so I will say nothing, my own take would be him still living in BTS\u2019s dorm. However! Given the fact that BH still pays for their dorm, and because of Taegi (Yoongi+ Taehyung) and Vmin (Taehyung+Jimin) recent selcas on twitter, which was taken in their dorm, I would say the place is still usable. Not Just for Jimin and Namjoon. I assume BTS\u2019s dorm is used when the members have hectic schedules. It helps them both physically and mentally. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think so. When they moved to Hannam the Hill, they said each member got their own rooms except for Jimin and J-Hope who shared the biggest bedroom. They were able to do this because they split the living room and converted it to two bedrooms for Tae and JK. Well fast forward to Bon Voyage season 4, which was filmed in their dorm. (At the beginning, when they\u2019re gathering with their luggage.) The living room is in tact. So where do Tae and Jk live then? Plus there are plenty of things that they say that kind of give it away. They\u2019ve said on several occasions how difficult it is for all of them to be together at once. Wouldn\u2019t this be easily accomplished if they lived together? On the last Run BTS episode King of Avatar Cook, everyone seems surprised when Tae says he\u2019s been cooking lately at home. If they lived together, wouldn\u2019t at least a few members know this? ",

There have been times when the members have been surprised on a confession of another member cooking or something. This might say that they don't live together. At the same time, in \u2018in the soop' jimin, namjoon and hoseok were making fun of jungkook for snoring. They said that he started the habit recently, how would they kno if they weren't living together. I think they try to distribute their time in their dorm and apartment respectively. Jin also said him and hobi are roommates. They all are/were dating someone and they obviously spend time with their partner, which is probably in their apartment. Anyhow, it shouldn't matter to us. The members really love each other. In a recent interview taehyung cried because hobi talked about what he wanted to tell his members. It shouldn't trouble us :) ",

However they've said many times that they enjoy living together and still do. BigHit also still pays for their dorm meaning it's being used. Jimin himself has said how lonely he gets on his won and how he prefers being with the others. They all seem happy together and from a business stand point it is much easier to have them all in one place together as they're always doing something that requires the whereabouts of them all. They have been isolating together aswell since the start. So yes, they live together and probably will continue to for as long as they're a group \ud83d\ude0a ",

Taehyung's apartment is in Apelbaum and Suga in UN Village Hannam River Hill. I heard Jimin bought a old house and Namjoon apartment. There's videos in YouTube in which they give tours of their apartments. Not them but a YouTuber, obviously not their actual apartment or dorm but a apartment in the complex similar to theirs. ",
