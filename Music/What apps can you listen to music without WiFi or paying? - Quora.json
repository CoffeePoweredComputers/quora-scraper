            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll give this answer a shot, my recommendation is Google Play Music!  Anyone that had a Google account or even a Gmail will have a Google play account. When u log in to the music app or online, you have instant access to a large number of music stations and podcasts for free. On top of that, you can add your own music to Google\u2019s servers for free. More on that below. Obviously, one of the biggest pros to that is with google being your music provider, you have instant access on up to 10 devices. They have an Android app, usually pre installed. There is also an app for IOS. Now my favorite thing about Google Play Music is that you can upload your personal collection of music. This collection can be up to 50,000 songs. Just download the music uploader from google, direct it to the folder your music is on, and press start. All the music uploaded is accessible from any device. The android app, the iOS app, and of course web browsers. Google also offers a full access package for $9.99 a month. A family account allowing up to six members access costs $14.99. With access you can listen to an additional 35 million songs, plus you receive a YouTube red account. I personally only use the free side, as most of the music I like I already own and the stations that are available work rather well. ",
