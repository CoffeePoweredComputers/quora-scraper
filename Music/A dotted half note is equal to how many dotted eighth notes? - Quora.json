            "answer_text": "A dot after a not increases its length by one-half. If we speak of 4/4 time, a half-note is two beats long, and a dotted half-note would be three beats long. A dotted half-note is as long as six un-dotted eighth-notes. Still in 4/4 time, an eighth-note is as long as two sixteenth notes, and a dotted eighth-note is as long as three sixteenth notes. A dotted half note is as long as 12 sixteenth notes, so it would be as long as four dotted eighth notes. As a quarter-note is half as long as a half-note, a dotted quarter-note is half as long as a dotted half-note. As an eighth note is half as long as a quarter-note, a dotted eighth-note is half as long as a dotted quarter-note. However, I can\u2019t think of a single instance in which this information adds anything constructive to your musical thought. Besides leaving out a plural in the final word of your question, you bring up something of no value that I can think of, and I can\u2019t imagine any possible use you could have of such an answer in the practical practice of music.

            "answer_text": "Dotted notes relate to one another in the same way that undotted notes relate to one another, which thankfully make calculations easy. In the same way that a half-note is equal to two quarter-notes and by extension four eighth-notes, a dotted half-note is equal to two dotted quarter-notes and by extension four dotted eighth-notes. That said, this is less useful than it sounds, because you still need to split and tie these notes according to the pulse of the music, in order to create proper beaming. ",
