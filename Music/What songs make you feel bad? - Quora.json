            "answer_text": "Most pop and rap music makes me feel bad about the culture, if that's what you're getting at. Four chords, drugs, bitches, money\u2026 I expect a little more at these musicians\u2019 pay grade. If you mean music that makes me feel sad, I can point you in various directions. After an unsuccessful romance I either listen to rock music to try to lift my spirits, in which case I run across things like \u201cDo you love me now?\u201d by The Breeders, \u201c\"I don\u2019t love you\u201d by My Chemical Romance, some Coheed and Cambria can be pretty melancholy\u2026 Or I listen to singer-songwriter types like Simon & Garfunkel or Bob Dylan, where there's a lot of wistfulness flying around (see \u201cI Am a Rock\u201d, \u201cWednesday Morning, 3 A.M.\u201d, \u201cTomorrow is a long place\u201d, and more). On the whole, these three are pretty jolly, treating some hard topics with an even, upbeat tone, but the above selections are not the only exceptions. ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting. I suppose I will expose a vulnerability through a song, because it won't make a difference here anymore. It's rather silly, but I keep strolling through those lanes of memory. They say it can be healthy. They say it's good for the soul. Doesn't really feel so hot, but I don't mind the cold. Death Cab for Cutie - Tiny Vessels  This is the moment that you know That you told you loved her but you don't. You touch her skin and then you think That she is beautiful but she don't mean a thing to me. Yeah, she is beautiful, but she don't mean a thing to me. I spent two weeks in Silverlake. The California sun cascading down my face There was a girl with light brown streaks And she was beautiful but she didn't mean a thing to me. Yeah, she was beautiful, but she didn't mean a thing to me. Wanted to believe in all the words that I was speaking As we moved together in the dark. And all the friends that I was telling. And all the playful misspellings. And every bite I gave you left a mark. Tiny vessels oozed into your neck And formed the bruises, That you said you didn't want to fade, But they did and so did I that day. All I see are dark grey clouds In the distance moving closer with every hour. So when you ask \"Was something wrong?\", That I think \"You're damn right there is but we can't talk about it now. No, we can't talk about it now.\" So one last touch and then you'll go. And we'll pretend that it meant something so much more, But it was vile, and it was cheap. And you are beautiful, but you don't mean a thing to me Yeah, you are beautiful, but you don't mean a thing to me. Yeah, you are beautiful, but you don't mean a thing to me. ",
