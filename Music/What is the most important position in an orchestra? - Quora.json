            "answer_text": "My experience has been that the most important position in an orchestra is the principal double bassist. When the conductor wants to move forward in tempo in the first rehearsal, you will usually find that the basses are spot on with the conductor every step of the way. Once the strings hear that something is changing they will latch on to what the basses are doing. In many good orchestras each player will always wait for the impetus to come from somewhere they can hear rather than the subjective movements of a conductor\u2019s arms. The standard symphony orchestra is made up of 50% strings and the rest in different proportions. Even some of the loudest wind, brass and percussion instruments in many cases have no power to make the orchestra take a different trajectory. For one, they don\u2019t have the same unity as the strings as a group, and secondly their parts are simply filled with many more bars rest than you\u2019ll ever find in a string part. Once the strings are unified, especially in passages which are intensely lyrical, there is no stopping them. I doubt any wind brass or percussion section would ever have that much control to change course along with the conductor once the strings have taken charge. Orchestras are tricky beasts at the best of times. Some might suggest the concertmaster. I fully agree that they hold the most important position in an orchestra in a symbolic sense. They also will be most engaged out of all the players in rehearsals, ideally by working alongside the conductor and asking for specific bowings. However I think every great conductor knows that the principal bass will have his eyes on him or her at all times, and a competent principal knows how to lead their section and consequently steer the massive vessel of the orchestra. In my experience the musical bond between the bass principal and their section in a great orchestra is something a concertmaster can only envy. ",

            "answer_text": "The question is rather meaningless. Every player in an orchestra is important, as all are being heard. If you put a bad player in a good orchestra, they will stick out no matter where they are sitting. Principal players are often heard more prominently as they play solos, so they could be called \u201cmore important.\u201d This varies hugely from piece to piece - for instance, some people are saying the concertmaster is the most important. Well, that maybe be true in terms of some of the duties involved, such as dealing with bowings. But while there are a number of pieces with big violin solos, most pieces do not feature the violin, while having huge solos for oboe, flute, clarinet and others. So it very much depends on the piece. The conductor is very important - but on the other hand, I have been involved in concerts where the conductor was suddenly taken ill and had to leave the stage, and the orchestra carried on without them. If the oboe section had left the stage, there would have been no way to replace them. Tuba players often have little of nothing to play, so you could say they are less important. But then something comes along like the gigantic tuba solo in Siegfried, and suddenly they are the most important person in the orchestra. ",
