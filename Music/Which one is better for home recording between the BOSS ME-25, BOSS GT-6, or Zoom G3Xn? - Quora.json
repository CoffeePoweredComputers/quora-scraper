Between the GT-6 and the G3Xn, the Boss is a sturdy, flexible, more analog tweaking, pedal but it is no longer in production (and I don\u2019t like buying used stomp boxes as they can get a beating. The Zoom is a modern, three display, highly programmable pedal and is still in the market. It has less amp emulations and simultaneous effects but it is a good pedal and, unless you can get a new GT6, I\u2019ld go with the Zoom. Now, all of that said, if you are going to record your guitar in a computer using a DAW and an interface, why not us the tons of effect apps available out there? ",
