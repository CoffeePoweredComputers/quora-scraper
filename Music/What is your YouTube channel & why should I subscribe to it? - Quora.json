            "answer_text": "What is your YouTube channel?Growth Origin Why should I subscribe to it?I made only 1 animated video a year or two ago on the boring subject of \u201cRSS Feeds.\u201d I did this because I needed a good explanation video for one of my web pages. But unfortunately for me, there wasn't any good videos anywhere. So I said \u201cscrew it\u201d and made one myself.And since the other videos I saw were rather boring, I did my best to make it as interesting as possible for everyone\u2014and I think I succeeded. It was my first video and it took 60 hours to make, despite being only 4-minutes long. As of today (2\u201319\u20132019) I\u2019ve gotten over 10,000 views and 100 subscribers (A 1% subscriber rate is really good btw!). And I\u2019m always the first video to show up on Youtube for nearly all of the most common search phrases related to my video subject. I\u2019ve since gotten way better at making videos and I have one completed video ready to upload, and right now I\u2019m currently working on it\u2019s twin video. In fact I just did 4 hours of work on it today. Since both of these two videos are interconnected & related and I plan to upload them both together with each video advertising the other at the end of it. In addition to these videos I\u2019m currently working on I also have 2\u20133 finished scripts, and distinct plans for about 20 future videos. I have showed about 7 people who weren't family or friends sneak peaks of my future content. And they all gave very genuine and powerful compliments\u2014even people I know to be extreme critics. In fact, not a single person had anything negative to say and all but one who doesn't have a Youtube account subscribed instantly. If you don\u2019t believe me, just look at the comments on my first video; RSS Made Easy. All those super kind comments are from complete strangers I\u2019ve never met. (Well; one is from my mom!) So I\u2019m going to do my best to consistently upload these videos and improve my drawing abilities and I want you to be with me on that journey.In a few years I want you to be able to say, \u201cI was one of the first 150 subscribers to Growth Origin\u201d - Waldo ",

            "answer_text": "Well, my YouTube channel is rather unique, because mine is probably the first channel that started out with Gaming videos and later traversed to Gun sync videos \ud83d\ude0a This transformation was when I decided to take a leap of faith and post my first gun sync video of Alan Walker's Faded\u2026It was a good step and I happened to garner more views than what a normal gaming video would. However, there were quite a lot of suggestions for improvement, and I decided to incorporate them in the next few videos. After incorporating these suggestions, I re-uploaded the gun sync version of Alan Walker's Faded and it was the first video that crossed 500 views. There was no looking back from there onwards! Later I decided to do gun syncs of famous indian songs. It was challenging and at the same time rewarding as well! Here's my best effort so far! \ud83d\ude0a Ae Dil Hai Mushkil - Gun Sync First Time Ever! Please do check it out and do let me know your feedback in the comments section \ud83d\ude0a ",
