            "answer_text": "While it\u2019s hard to compare the two since they come from different time periods with different tactics, my vote is for Caesar. True, Napoleon was an incredibly skilled general during a time when warfare was becoming more modern, which demonstrated his ability to adapt. Like Caesar, he was a bit of an outsider as he hailed from Corsica, not France. Caesar, the son of an impoverished aristocratic family, grew up in the Subura, or ghetto of Rome. They both accomplished many amazing feats in battle (Austerlitz for Napoleon; Alesia for Caesar) that are still studied today. They both seized the opportunity to take control of their respective governments using the army as leverage. Caesar, however, never lost a battle (some may argue that he lost at Gergovia, or that he was assassinated), nor was he captured by the enemy (he had been kidnapped by pirates as a young man, but he wasn\u2019t at the head of an army at the time, but after his release, he rounded up a platoon of soldiers and killed all his former captors mercilessly). Napoleon\u2019s Waterloo will forever be a source of infamy attached to the memory of France\u2019s former emperor, whereas Caesar was killed by political opponents. I would also add that in sheer numbers, Caesar won far more battles than Napoleon. Feel free to leave your comments about why I\u2019m wrong in the comments box. Hope you found my arguments cogent and interesting. ",

            "answer_text": "As Kyle says it\u2019s difficult to compare them. Both men were quick on their feet and knew how to inspire troops. Caesar was more of a populist, but I do think they would have admired each other had they met. It\u2019s been said that amateurs talk tactics, whereas professionals talk logistics. In that regard Caesar was more realistic than Napoleon, who didn\u2019t mind feeding his army on the stores of the peasants whose lands he tramped through. It\u2019s cheaper to steal (ahem, requisition) food and supplies from locals, but when your opponent is willing to burn all his crops to prevent you from getting them, you\u2019re in trouble. That\u2019s exactly what Napoleon ran into in Russia. Caesar didn\u2019t have that degree of hubris, partly because he was restrained by the Senate, but also because Roman armies brought their supplies with them. ",
