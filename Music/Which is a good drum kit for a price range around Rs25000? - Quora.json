            "answer_text": "You can get a decent Mapex/Pearl/Pluto kit for a little more than 25k. Don\u2019t buy the Chancellor/Stagg kits, I haven\u2019t heard good things about them. But I think you won\u2019t get a throne or cymbals with the kit. That you\u2019ll have to buy separately. You can also try buying a second hand kit. Before buying make sure you have space for an acoustic kit, a room with some soundproofing, as you don\u2019t want people complaining about the noise, protection from moisture and as much as possible from dust. I live in a building so I cannot get an acoustic kit, hence I got an electric kit (Alesis DM6) for 20k. It\u2019s a great kit. Pretty portable as compared to an acoustic kit, and I can use headphones with it. ",
