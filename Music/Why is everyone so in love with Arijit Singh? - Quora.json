            "answer_text": "Short Answer because he has a voice that resonates with the large number of Indians who have been brought up in \u2018only Indian\u2019 families that foster on drama and bollywood which is inherently melodramatic. And in Ramadhir Singh\u2019s words \u201cSAbke dimag me apni apni picture chal rahi hai aur sab us picture ka hero banna chahte hain\u201d, toh jab us hero (aaj ke melodramatic londe) ko chhota mota se leke bada ya bahut bada koi bhi dukh hota hai\u2026.. woh apne aapko ranbir kapoor samajhne lagta hai aur leke baith jata hai\u2026\u2026Arijit Singh ko jaise unke Grandparents Mukesh ko leke baith jate the aur unke Parents Kumar Shanu ko. har generation me aisa hota hai ek singer who feeds on emotional melodrama inherent in Indian society. P.S.- I have nothing against Arijit or his fans. This is just an answer written light- heartedly. In fact I too listen to Channa Mereya when my gf pushes me away in bed. LOL ",
