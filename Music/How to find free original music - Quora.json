It\u2019s actually a music making studio in itself, so you can make your own as well, if you so choose. It\u2019s a great site, I use it all the time. You can find me there by searching for \u201cFever Dream Studios\u201d in the \u201cTracks\u201d section. I have one track that says \u201cTest,\u201d on my channel that just means it\u2019s a different version of a song I\u2019ve already published. It\u2019s better than the old one though. :) ",
