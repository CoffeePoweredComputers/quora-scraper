Even using a second of a track can give you a copyright strike. It depends on the copyright owner though, they can chose to request a takedown, monetize your video or not bother altogether.  ",

There is no such thing as a 30-second exemption. If money is an issue, there are hundreds of music libraries out there that will licence tracks for you for reasonable amounts. ",
