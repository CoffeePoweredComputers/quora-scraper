            "answer_text": "Speaking for Finland here. I think Metallica and Iron Maiden were huge in terms of influence on young musicians in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s. Both bands toured Finland a lot and even small places. Also Guns \u2019n Roses and other hair bands, Van Halen, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath. You know, the usual ones. Starting from the 90\u2019s big Finnish metal bands like Him and Nighwish started popping up. The latter has enjoyed a lot of success abroad. Lordi\u2019s victory in the Eurovision song contest in 2006 validated metal music in the ears of the nation. As to why it\u2019s so popular, perhaps the darker themes and melancholic music hit a nerve on the national psyche. The winters are long and dark\u2026 Old stuff from Metallica and Van Halen is pretty much the only metal music I listen to nowadays. ",

            "answer_text": "Not quite sure, it is a music form that never made sense to me, so much noise to the point of drowning out everything else. Otherwise, my totally unfounded (high rate of depression existing in those countries?) theory is that people likes listening to heavy metal because it drowns out the noise of their pain. Like an audio version of cutting yourself to handle and control emotional overload, it numbs and distract from the emotional pain. Within the constant noise is ultimative silence. Heavy metal bands seems to do terrific rhapsodies and slow songs though, it is pretty much the only pieces of theirs I may want to hear. ",
