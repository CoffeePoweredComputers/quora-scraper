            "answer_text": "This song tells us a lot of things and by lot of things, I mean it. This song starts with a soft voice \u201cIt starts with\u2026\u201d . The person wants to say that it all started with one thing and gradually they all piled up into one big mess and he tried to hard but in the end it doesn't matter. The rap tells the whole story whereas the chrous just amplifies that rough feeling. The rap tells that he designed this rhyme to remind himself all the trouble his been through. In a latter stage Mike said that while he was writing the song he was all alone in a room and couldn't figure out what he should be doing to get rid of the boredom. That's how he wrote this song as he felt time was just slipping away (Reanimation Version of this ;-)). Infact this song does reflect the thing that Chester had been piling up a lot of struggle and anxiety in himself, which he just wanted to let go but he could never do that. That is why he says \u201cI tried so hard, But in the end it doesn't even matter\u201d. He tried with all his might but he just couldn't get over it. As time passed by he felt he was just slipping away from the real life and entering into his dark life, full of substance abuse. He also says that it doesn't matter to you if I just fall. With which he might be referring to his teenage life when he was molested by an old male friend but no one reached to his help. He just understood the pain was all his and he decided to pile it up. Gradually it became a huge mess that started haunting him and finally led to his lifelong depression. Lastly I would like say that always reach out to people next to you, you may not know what he is going through. Tell them it's okay to be not okay. We all have bad times. It will be okay soon. Stretch out your hand towards them. Pick them up and make them feel better. #MakeChesterProud That's all I got to say about this. RIP Chester. Peace Out!! ",
