            "answer_text": "I wouldn't necessarily say that specific types of artists are missing. But there are definitely whole genres of music missing from the industry.  Americana music, doom death and black metal, alt-country, indy-folk, and even real EDM and Trance music are VERY popular.  But that's in spite of industry recognition and radio coverage.  My city has 4 or 5 country radio stations, 3 or 4 classic rock stations, and a \"rock\" station that will play 5 Fingered Death Punch back to back with some 45 year old hippie Led Zeppelin song.   The newer genres of music are nonexistent in commercial radio. ",

            "answer_text": "If you follow local bands or indie music as much as you do mainstream there is really not much missing. What is missing is very original music in the mainstream. So much of music now is formula music. A good hook, an easy listen results in a good sell. I would love to see more risks taken by big labels and radio stations. There is a reason (at least in Milwaukee) why the local stations that play local music and indie music are so popular. It is hard to have a new king or queen of pop when it all sounds somewhat the same. ",

            "answer_text": "There really isn't. It is like the old adage: if you have two people interested in something, you have a magazine business. With vast improvements in recording tech and production there are thousands of little record labels being birthed (eww) around the world to reflect the tastes of niche markets. It is not the job of the corporate music industry to represent, record, and release these artists...it would be a disservice to both parties. Don't blame the acts or their lil labels if you can't find them. You have the whole of the internet, when all you probably need is Google or Youtube, and the ability to type in [random word mistaken for genre] + [misspelled word mistaken for music genre] usually equals... This a far cry from the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s when you were certain there was something out there, just not sure how long to drive, nor which direction. ",
