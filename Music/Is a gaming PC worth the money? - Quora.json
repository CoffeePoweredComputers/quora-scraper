            "answer_text": "Yup. First off, you don\u2019t necessarily need to spend that much. Most people overlook two things: Used hardware is fairly cheap compared to brand new stuff. If you\u2019re assembling a top of the line PC, you may as well go for brand new stuff, but if you\u2019re scraping by on a small budget, second hand hardware from eBay is your best friend.Most benchmark sites benchmark hardware on how well it runs stuff on \u201cultra\u201d settings. Ultra settings in 2019 are completely overrated - compared to medium or high settings. Most of the time, medium or high settings can look very similar to Ultra, but simply have the anti-aliasing kicked down a notch, or maybe there\u2019s no godrays coming from the sun when you walk through the forest for all 3 minutes of the 18 hour campaign. There\u2019s lots of video these days of lots of games comparing their ultra graphics settings with high or medium, and in most of the games released within the last 5 years, the differences are genuinely difficult to notice unless you pause the video and scavenge for them. Meanwhile, Ultra tends to take up way more processing power than high or medium, because while high and medium are optimized to run on most rigs, ultra is just there for PCs that are so overpowered they can take a lot of extra work for a little extra graphical gain the play may not even notice. Because of this, you don\u2019t necessarily need to search for a GPU that can run your games on ultra settings in order to get a GPU that allows your games to run well while also keeping the graphical fidelity up to your standards.Plus, you can tweak individual settings. I don\u2019t really like Anti-Aliasing, so I keep it turned off completely, since I find it sort of redundant playing games at 1080P, and completely redundant playing them at 4K. This increases my performance, and allows me to jack up settings I do care about, like texture fidelity and model detail and lighting.Given these two important notes, you can get a gaming PC for as little as $300 to $400 via used hardware. Buy a $200 Office PC off of eBay. Lots of old businesses are replacing their old computers with new ones, but the old computers can have great hardware in them with loads of potential. It\u2019s not uncommon to see a desktop PC with an old core i5 or i7 and 4 to 8 GB of RAM go for this price. Don\u2019t ignore the storage drive completely, but don\u2019t worry if it\u2019s trash. This is your gaming PC, and you can upgrade it and swap it out later. Just make sure the desktop you\u2019re getting is a large tower PC with plenty of space inside for the GPU. It\u2019s ok if it\u2019s one of those \u201cslim towers\u201d, just make sure you know how thin it is and whether you can fit a small form factor graphics card in there.Get a gaming video card for this PC. It has a decent enough video card and a fair amount of RAM, at least for now, but it needs a video card to run games well. You can find a good 1080P one between $100 and $150, depending on whether you go for a GTX 1050, 1050ti, 1060, or AMD Equivalent (look into the AMD Equivalent - I\u2019m finding RX 560\u2019s cheaper than GTX 1050ti\u2019s). Make sure to look for a \u201clow form factor\u201d or \u201csmall form factor\u201d option if you\u2019re trying to put it in to a thinner desktop. Also, watch out for scam ones sold by shady Chinese retailers. Sometimes they take an old and defective card from the early 2000\u2019s, slap some stickers on it and hack the firmware to make it think it's a GTX 1050, and sell it for $50. Don't do it. Even if totally working after restoring the firmware to a proper state, these cards are nowhere near worth the price of $50.This is optional unless you bought an office PC that omits the storage drive, but get an SSD. You can find a 250 GB one for $30 to $50, and they\u2019re extremely fast. Your games will load extremely quickly, and your PC will boot up so fast that you\u2019ll wonder how you tolerated waiting 30 seconds for it to boot off a regular hard drive. If you need a lot more space than 250 GB, and you\u2019re willing to sacrifice speed rather than money to get more space, you can get a 1 TB hard drive for around the same price. You can usually get a 2TB hard drive for maybe $10 to $20 more though, so it\u2019s worth expanding the budget a little for the transition from 1 TB to 2 TB.Hook this PC up to your TV if you lack a computer monitor. You can find a keyboard and mouse at a thrift shop for no more than $5 (total, not apiece) if somehow you do not have either one lying around. You can get a gaming mouse or keyboard later if the prospect truly interests you. I have a \u201cgaming mouse\u201d that I purchased off of eBay for $30 because it had a higher DPI than other mice, is really accurate, and has two extra buttons on the side for me to play with compared to a normal mouse. It\u2019s nothing crazy, but it\u2019s sort of nice to have when I run out of keys on my keyboard to bind, although I haven\u2019t put these extra buttons to use quite yet.Blam, you now have a gaming PC. Install your choice of Operating System and you\u2019re ready to roll. A Windows license will cost $100, but you can download a copy of the OS from Microsoft\u2019s website without paying a cent, and there\u2019s places you can get it cheaper. For just a little more than you would spend on a console up front, you get so much more freedom as to how you play your games. On the PC, there's more games, especially games that will never come to console because the game is a hobbyist game, or it's an indie too niche and small to succeed on a console. There's all sorts of wonderful games on PC you would be hard pressed to find anything like on console. Some of my favorite games are open source ones like Open RA, or Assault Cube. They\u2019re made and released entirely for free, and could never see a release on a console because they\u2019re too niche to the PC and too small for a console company to consider. I get that they\u2019re not profitable, but they don\u2019t need to be in order to be fun to play. I also get that a game doesn\u2019t need to be released for free as a labor of love or whatever, and many of my favorite games are also ones that could have never been made for free and open source and all that, but I appreciate that the PC allows these kinds of games to coexist with each other.You get to choose which control scheme you play with, whether it's keyboard and mouse, controller, steering wheel, joy stick, Wii remote, or guitar hero controller, you can map any input on any controller to the controls of nearly every game.You can control the graphical settings of the game you're playing. If you don't like Motion Blur, you can turn it off. If you don't like anti-aliasing, turn it off. If you really like film grain or lens flare or whatever it is I hate these days, you can crank it up to 11. If you would rather game at 60 fps than 30, you can play with settings until you get that 60. On Console, you're locked to whatever the game developers decided was best for everyone whether you like it or not. If they thought 30 fps was Ok because it allows them to enable the lens dirt and lens flare and motion blur and film grain and tactical bloom and blue-orange Nerf tint that makes the game look \u201cstylistic and immersive\u201d (developer speak for oversaturated and ugly), you're stuck with that on console, and you can't change it, no matter how much you hate the low FPS or video settings.You can download all sorts of mods to tailor the experience to what you want, or just to fix something the game doesn\u2019t provide any settings to change, or to add more features to the game. You can also flip on cheats in single player games, or on your own private server with friends or whatever on multiplayer games.Did I mention you can run your own servers on PC? These servers can run their own mods, plugins, special gamemodes, custom maps, special rules, etc. Consider the game Team Fortress 2, for example. You can play Valve\u2019s default servers to play the default gamemodes on the official mapset, and it\u2019s a pretty fun time, but if you\u2019re looking for something crazy, you can join a community server. You\u2019ll find servers dedicated to testing custom maps, servers dedicated to playing just one map over and over, servers dedicated to having every hit become a \u201ccritical hit\u201d that deals 3X the damage of a regular one (known as \u201call crit\u201d servers), and thus where every attack becomes 3X more lethal. You\u2019ll find servers with low gravity, servers with custom gamemodes like zombie survival or prophunt, servers dedicated to just chilling and trading items with people online, servers dedicated to idling the game to earn more items over time, and lots more. On consoles, you would only be able to play on the official servers.You don\u2019t need to pay a subscription service to play online with other people. This brings the cost of consoles up over time. An Xbox One S may cost $200, but 3 years of Xbox Live would bring it up to the price of a PC.You have all sorts of online stores on the PC, each with their own strengths and weaknesses and sales and all that. You can get quality games for crazy cheap on PC if you\u2019re smart about how and when you buy them. I first discovered Killing Floor, one of my favorite zombie games, back in 2016 because it was on sale for 50 cents during Halloween. Not 50 percent off, just 50 cents. I played it that night and was enthralled by the team-based zombie survival gameplay. It\u2019s a game that, while dated and a little rough around the edges at times, worth the full price of $15 it normally sits at, but I got it for only 50 cents. On consoles, you have just the one online store and a couple of different brick and mortar stores like Walmart and Gamestop that are basically the same. Eventually, it\u2019ll just be one online store. Most of the games are the $60 AAA games you see released every year, and the indie titles that are present on the consoles are the ones that went mainstream and bumped their prices up to $30 in the process.You can do more than just play games on a gaming PC. If you want to learn to program or experiment with 3D modeling or edit images or video or whatever, the PC has you covered.",

            "answer_text": "This is a fun subject for me, I\u2019ve been a gamer for a long time and there\u2019s a lot of factors that can go into this. To answer your question, what is gaming to you? I honestly think everyone should have that 1 thing that is premium. For some people that\u2019s their Mustang GT, their expensive watch, their designer handbag, jewelry and etc. If you spend enough time gaming and if you really like games where the quality and lag are an issue, then I\u2019d invest appropriately into a good gaming PC. For me that one premo thing as a gamer is my Alienware 18 Laptop.  Full disclosure, I typically tend to be against laptop purchases as a gamer for a few reasons. Mobility, yes they are portable but they are heavy. This bad boy is a whooping 12.06 lbs.Battery life- Yes it has a battery but try playing any game with high graphics (like this monster is made to do) and you\u2019ll go through that in no timeUpgrades - You can swap out the harddrive for more storage but that\u2019s about all you can do. The graphics cards are incorporated and cannot be swapped out. I\u2019ve had my machine since 2015 and it cannot do VR :(.Price - Gaming Laptops are more expensive compared to PC with the same specifications. Be prepared to pay more for the same specs for Mobility.The reason I got it though (and no regrets). I really enjoy playing PC games such as Starcraft 2, fallout and a variety of others. Even today with my 2015 model technically being \u201cobsolete\u201d I can still run most modern games on medium graphics and most older games on Ultra graphics. The quality is important to me and playing Real Time Strategy games (RTS) like starcraft I really wanted a machine that could keep up and minimize lag. I also enjoy open world environment games (like fallout) and the quality of the graphics and immersion into the game environment was important for me. Better believe I can see the blades of grass and the water flowing with my rig. Specific to the laptop, I like having the mobility. Due to work and Travel I\u2019m not home as much as I would like to be. So I take my gaming on the road or while at my weekend job. Though this gaming laptop was expensive, for me, the amount was more than worth it and I definitely got my money\u2019s worth out of it. Even now with it being 4 years old. ",
