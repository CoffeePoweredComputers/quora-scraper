            "answer_text": "One of the Standards of Active Pickups are EMG. While they may or may not have invented the concept of a Active Pickup. Which is a pickup with a small built in pre amp. They probably did more than any single company to popularize them. Their quality has always been high also. I have a EMG 60 someone gave me about 1988 that was already used and it\u2019s still plugging along decades later. EMG has a diverse variety of models with something for everyone along with a number of tone enhancing circuits that can be plugged into the harness. The new systems are modular and basically plug and play with only output, ground and battery circuits requiring any soldering. They also sell a number of pre wired Strat systems mounted on drop on pick guards. Anyone with a screw driver and a soldering iron can install one as long as there is room for the battery. And most Strats and Gibson\u2019s have enough room for a 9volt battery somewhere. The pre wired Strat systems used to run around 299.00 with a guard as I recall. A google search will show up dealers. Since this is Quora I might as well answer the inevitable questions of \u201cWhy are EMG pickups so Expensive?\u201d And they aren\u2019t. Your buying a top flight product from a company doing research and development that\u2019s innovated and defined a entire market segment. And they are no more expensive than many aftermarket replacement pickups sold singly. And it being Quora we will have \u201cWhat\u2019s the cheapest active pickup system money can buy?\u201d Which loosely translates into How Little can I Spend to Buy a Mediocre Product when Quality is Secondary to Price? If you wish to save money here are some alternatives. There is a company called DragonFire that makes lower quality but adequate products that you can find on eBay among other inline sources. They offer \u201cOK\u201d quality products cheaply. I have no experience with their active pickups but have bought a few pieces of hardware like bridges over the years to replace stock cheap Asian Guitar hardware on low end guitars without modifying them. I\u2019m not going to bad mouth them at the price points they sell at but point out my personal experience is that you get what you pay for. 15.00 vibrato bridges replacing worn out factory bridges don\u2019t last any longer than OEM. Which is to say not long. But they are cheap. When that\u2019s your primary criteria they fit the bill. Guitar Fetish or GFS guitar parts has their own line of active pickup systems called Red Active. I have no experience with these personally but in general their direct sale model tends to get you a little more than you pay for. Their products are extremely popular with the DIY modding crowd and people love their pickups at the price points they sell them at. There are two other budget options. One is to buy a set of used EMGs off craigslist or eBay. Given the quality and legendary durability of the product and the fact the pickups rarely fail this is a pretty safe bet and nets you the good stuff at a significant savings. And you can always find new EMG systems on eBay cheaper than retail. The final option is also simple. At the risk of over simplifying things it\u2019s important to note there are Active Pickup systems and Active Electronics. Active Pickups have the amp in the pickup itself. Active Electronics replace the guitars standard wiring with a preamp which gets you nearly all of the benefits of active pickups like low impedance buffered output. Quieter operation. Increased gain. Active Tone controls on some systems. These are great if you need Active Pickup features but like your current pickups. While not the only product out there EMG makes a product called The Afterburner that\u2019s a 30db or so active pre amp on a volume pot. Install one as the last control before the guitars output jack and you pick up nearly all the benefits of a complete active pickup system. And going from memory a Afterburner is in the neighborhood of 59.99. 30db is almost enough gain to overdrive a silver panel Fender Twin Reverb and that\u2019s saying something. ",

            "answer_text": "Around $200 for a humbucker set. There are only three established pickup brands offering active pickups: emg, seymour duncan, and recently, fishman. The fishman fluence cost more, but they incorporate a newer technology that offer more features. If you're unsure if you want to go active or not check out gfs pickups, or dragonfire pickups. They sell chinese made active pickups that cost next to nothing. Obviously, the quality won't be nowhere near the brand name stuff, but you'll be able to get a good sense of what active pickups offer that passive pickups don't, and If you like them you can move onto the brand name stuff.
