            "answer_text": "No Doubt about it: WUTHERING HEIGHTS From Allmusic.com: When \u201dWuthering Heights\u201d, the teenaged Kate Bush\u2019s debut single, hit #1 in the UK chart in January 1978, it not only astounded listeners, who\u2019d never, ever, heard anything like it before, but it also set the singer a near- impossible bar to scramble over with every subsequent release. Written in early 1977, some months after the young prodigy was signed to EMI, \u201dWuthering Heights\u201d was not originally planned as a single \u2013 the label had already scheduled \u201dJames and the Cold Gun\u201d, when Bush brought this new song into focus. Her instincts were correct \u2013 \u201dWuthering Heights\u201d was the ideal preview for her then-forthcoming debut LP, a haunting and ethereal reinvention of Emily Bronte\u2019s windswept, heather-ripped moors love story, delivered in an octave shattering span. With crescendos of piano and strings and Ian Bairnson\u2019s keening guitar becoming a voice in its own right, there were moments when the lithe singer was lost within her own music. Never fear, though, as Bush\u2019s trademark vocal punch always pushed through, as the song\u2019s variegated streams of emotion demanded. Although the UK music press unequivocally dismissed the song as mere novelty, its success, and the foundations that it laid, ensured it became one of Bush\u2019s best known and well loved hits \u2013 so much so that, when Bush recorded a new vocal for the song\u2019s inclusion on 1986\u2019s Whole Story hits compilation, the performance sparked savage debate between purists and newcomers, as to which was the better, and therefore, definitive version. It is, of course, the first one. But I\u2019m to old for this - gimme the Stooges or Velvet Undground ",
