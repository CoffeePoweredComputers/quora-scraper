            "answer_text": "I am not expert in singing. I play the piano but god I would rather walk on fire than let someone hear me sing. But really the best out of best IMO is Chen from EXO. Like his album? Masterpiece. I feed myself on that album I needed more than sunny year needs rain. It's magnificent. Love Words is a work of art. And Exo is a band with skilfull singers- Bakehyun is God. DO-pure and perfect, Xumin unique AF...but Chen is a different universe. There is a video of him singing some female song without changing a key and it's mindblowing.  Asking for a female vocalist, my favorite one was always Taeyeon from SNSD but realistically the one with most skills is EXID Solji. I cry listening to her performing \uc81c\ubc1c by Lee Sora? It gives you chills. I cry watching that (and I am not a cry baby at all) performance every single time. Uh, chills all over the place it's perfect.  ",

            "answer_text": "For males, in terms of technique, Super Junior\u2019s vocal line destroy everyone just by Kyuhyun alone. Exo\u2019s vocal line (Chen especially) comes close but I feel like Kyuhyun\u2019s experience wins over Chen. In newer groups, Seventeen\u2019s Seungkwan and DK, NCT\u2019s Taeil and Jaehyun, Monsta X\u2019s Kihyun (and probably a few others that I forgot) show a lot of promise but aren\u2019t quite at SJ and EXO\u2019s level yet. I\u2019m excited to see them improve though. For females, I would say Ailee and Taeyeon though they\u2019re more solo singers. Most of the girl groups with experienced and technicallly good vocalists have already disbanded sadly. In newer groups, Gfriend\u2019s Yuju, Red Velvet\u2019s Wendy, Oh My Girl\u2019s Seunghee and Mamamoo are all very good. ",

His vocal tone is also very smooth. Girl Groups: This one\u2019s harder than the other for me\u2026 some that stand out to me are Jihyo, Solar, Yuju, Taeyeon, and Wendy. But no matter how biased I am, obviously Solar, Yuju, and Taeyeon are unbeatable. Out of these three, I feel like Taeyeon is the most capable. Her voice is strong, and has a lot of emotion. ",
