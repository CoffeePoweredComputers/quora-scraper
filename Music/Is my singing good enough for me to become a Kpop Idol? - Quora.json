            "answer_text": "Hmm\u2026 It's kind of hard to say since I only listened to one song that you covered. Perhaps try to make a few more covers of a variety of songs, because it could be that this song does suit your voice, okay, but another could be like the icing on a cake. I have a question to ask: Are you confident enough? I'm a singer myself, and I'm working on my confidence. Maybe start off singing in an empty house with no one in it, that may loosen the pressure. Remember, confidence is key to have the most amazing voice. Like the answer before me said, you should consider critiquing your singing skills by taking lessons. If you can't afford or you can't find someone who will help you, take online ones, although, a face-to-face contact would be better. Hopefully, you increase your singing ability and maybe you could become an idol! I'll be rooting for you!\ud83d\ude4c ",

            "answer_text": "As of the moment, no, but remember they've had years of years and training so you just have to practice! Your rhythm seems to be pretty good but you should work on your pitch accuracy. Learning an instrument would definitely help, or start ear training online. Second, I think your lacking some basic vocal training. Learn how to use your chest voice and head voice and a mix of both, as often times you are singing in falsetto with notes that I think you should easily be able to reach with your chest voice. Lastly, I'd reccomend going to a vocal coach, as they would help you improve on everything I just mentioned and more. Good luck! ",
