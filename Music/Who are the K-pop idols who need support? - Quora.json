            "answer_text": "okay here\u2019s just a few. And believe me, just a few. The Kpop industry is so super harsh, a lot of people need support. Y\u2019all are free to add as many other idols as u want in the comment section. Taeyeon from SNSD: She has been fighting depression for as long as I can ever remember. Her mental health is so absolutely bad and the problem is that some people choose to ignore it. Not to mention the amount of hate she started to get when she dated EXO\u2019s Baekhyun and how it\u2019s still going to this day.. As well as accusations about how SNSD members were picked at random and in a biased way (which is not true btw). She had to stand up for these kind of dreadful rumors for her group on her Instagram account. She just has a lot of weight on her back and she definitely needs a lot of support..Kang Daniel: Ever since Wanna One disbanded and this boy has been getting nothing but HATE. True hatred. Haters make fun of him and the way he cried during Wanna One\u2019s last concert. They started to send hate to his fans. Whenever they try to support Kang Daniel with any kind of love they get attacked by the haters. They even got out of their way to attack his own PARENTS!! Saying they gave birth to a disgrace. And oh boy the rumors when he bought a house at UN Village (basically a very fancy ass place in Korea) and when the news of him dating Jihyo from TWICE were announced to the public.. Fortunately, he started to take legal actions against malicious comments and I couldn\u2019t be prouder.Jihyo from TWICE: Some fans were just not having it when it was confirmed that she\u2019s in a relationship with Kang Daniel. When she suddenly disappeared from MAMA2019 and came to explain what happened to her on Vlive chat, people were also not having it and started criticizing the way she \u201capologized\u201d (even tho, ngl, her apology was just\u2026 not the best I would say. Even tho I am not a ONCE I was disappointed but this gives NO EXCUSE to send her hate. She must be going through something we don\u2019t know about). Also, she has been attacked in the past (and I guess till this day but it\u2019s not as serious as the old times) for her weight and how they saw her as a fat Kpop idol.ill continue the rest later but here are some more idols: Kim SamuelTaehyung from BTSJungwoo and Taeyong from NCTf(x) membersKim JaehwanKuanlinMomolandSOMITRCNG",

            "answer_text": "Lee Hoseok - ie Wonho - of Monsta X. Just, retweet those hashtags. Shownu, Jooheon, Minhyuk, Changkyun, Kihyun, Hyungwon - ALSO of Monsta X, who are being grossly overworked, and having their pain & misery over the departure of Wonho ignored. Kim Hanbin from iKON - he\u2019s now released a new song which is highly encouraging. YG, SCREW YOU SIDEWAYS. Wendy of Red Velvet - WTF happened there??? Kang Daniel - getting hate for dating, sheesh. Give it up little fangirls. He\u2019s also going thru problems with management. Seungri of Big Bang - oh, look, he\u2019s NOT getting prosecuted! For anything, apparently! One media giant has already apologized for using his name as clickbait on scandals that only marginally involved him (that molka phone of JJY\u2019s, & the Burning Sun mess). Oops\u2026 T.O.P., GD, Daesung, Taeyang of Big Bang - just, haters gonna hate, but these guys are STILL huge - GDragon especially. They hopefully will have a tour in the States (around the time of Cochella) - I\u2019ll be there if it comes anywhere close to the East Coast. ",
