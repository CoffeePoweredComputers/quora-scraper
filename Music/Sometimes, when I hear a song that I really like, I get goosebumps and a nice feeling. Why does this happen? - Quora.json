For instance, when I first heard , Alice In Chains-Nutshell, I cried on the train because what I went through and what the lyrics were saying-it hit home for me. Or hell, it sounded good to you that you got goosebumps. ",

            "answer_text": "That reaction is very, very strong for me. That's why I became a musician.Why does it happen? Music is part of our evolution. We used it to remember things across generations, before we invented writing. Have you noticed how much easier it is to remember the exact wordings of a story if it's a song, rather than if it's just a written story?I assume this deep connection is the reason we can react so strongly to it.
