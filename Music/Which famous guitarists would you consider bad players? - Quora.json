            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a hard question to field because it\u2019s unclear what criteria for a \u201cbad\u201d player to be. If it\u2019s just a lack of skill, even the \u201cworst\u201d famous players have to have at least a fundamental knowledge of chords and scales and riffs. Some have more knowledge of that stuff than others but that doesn\u2019t make them \u201cbad\u201d players. For example Steve Vai certainly has far more musical knowledge and skill than The Edge but that doesn\u2019t make Edge a bad player. Someone like Bob Dylan or Keith Richards or Tom Petty aren\u2019t fast or technical and never take memorable solos but their songwriting abilities on guitar are far beyond many who can play much faster and more accurately. Jimmy Page is one of the best of all time yet he\u2019s considered to be a \u201csloppy\u201d player. I guess my point here is that \u201cbad\u201d is a loaded term that can indicate deficiencies in any of a number of skills as a guitarist but you\u2019d be hard pressed to find a guitarist who\u2019s achieved fame with deficiencies in ALL areas of guitar playing. I can\u2019t think of a famous guitarist who lacks musical knowledge, accuracy, speed, rhythm playing, lead playing, songwriting abilities, a knack for riffs, feeling in their playing all at the same time.

            "answer_text": "I am going down the same road as Anders on this one. None of them are bad players because they were good enough to get there and sell some records. Is Eric Clapton boring to watch? Hell yes he is but he\u2019s also Eric Clapton which means he is definitely not a bad player. Is Jimmy Page sloppy? Hell yes he is but he\u2019s also Jimmy f$@&ing Page!!! He\u2019s always played like he was drunk (wait a minute, hmmmmm). All kinds of hair bands come to mind for me, but so what? They\u2019re retired and I\u2019m not. ",
