            "answer_text": "I LOVE Mili! Not only they had the most creative lyrics i have ever seen, their songs are not like the other existing music i have ever heard, but the first thing that made me a big fan of Mili is Momo\u2019s vocal voice. I first discovered Mili from an android music gane called Deemo, the song was nine point eight. The first time i hear it, the vocal reminds me of some anime songs, or female japanese singer who had such \u201ccute\u201d voice. But the more i listened to it, i started to feel that that\u2019s not just it. Momo has an unique voice, thats for sure. The arrangement of the song was uncommon but catchy and it gave me a feeling of \u201cthis is the new kind of music i have ever heard.\u201d even the Instrumental songs like friction or ephemeral sounds \u2018brand new\u2019 to me. And not to mention the lyric! With such deep meaning, unique and expanded vocabularies, the multi-languages and also the made up languages. And their unique point of view on every imaginable cases that gives us songs like The Bathtub Mermaid which i believe was a twisted story of the Little Mermaid! Mili represent the music that is carefully build, full of fantasy and imagination, and is so out-of-this-world to me. Their uniqueness captivated me! P.s = my favorite is Ga1ahad and Scientific Witchery which i sing with my friend (him as Ga1ahad and me as the purple witch), and also world.execute(me); which i always sing! ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A Geofanny B. Yohanes To be honest I don't know much about Mili since most of my knowledge about Japanese musical artists/groups comes from anime soundtracks. Well, Mili has also made anime soundtracks but I haven't watched any of the series with their songs yet..\r. Anyway, after hearing two of their songs on Youtube, several things come to mind: Their musics have this playful ambience. I don\u2019t know why but their first song that I\u2019ve played (Utopiosphere) reminds me of Claris. The difference is that Claris\u2019s songs sounds more mature soundings than Mili\u2019s. I haven't read the lyric much, but I won't be surprised if they have much deeper meanings than what their music suggests. Their next song: \u201cworld.execute(me);\u201d managed to make me laugh. That was the first time I\u2019ve heard a song\u2019s lyric about sex and love but being told in \u2018geekish\u2019 language mixed by \u2018usual\u2019 Japanese-style silliness (\u201cif I\u2019m an eggplant then I\u2019ll give you my nutrients\u201d etc). Overall it\u2019s a cute song but also weird and geekish at the same time. Personally, their music is not my kind of music. It\u2019s an age thing, I guess. But I really appreciate their wild creativity and hope that they can get more exposures especially since they seems to have a lot of English songs - no surprise considering that momocashew, the group\u2019s vocalist, is a trilingual.
