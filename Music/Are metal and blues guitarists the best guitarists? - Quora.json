            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A - this type of question is probably looking at music from the wrong end of the telescope. By that I mean music is not primarily a competitive activity, it is an artistic range of expression, so that a piece of music written by Mozart may very well be a work of genius and of amazing complexity, but this in no way means it has greater merit than a well written folk song. There are many who would disagree with that, but as is so often the case those who seek to exclude others and demonstrate their superior status are not artists or practitioners themselves, but partly educated enthusiasts seeking to gain kudos. Metal and Blues are different genres - although it could be strongly argued metal has origins in Blues, as does so much of western modern music. Each musical form has specific technical demands on the player, if they are to be truly 'authentic' exponents of their craft. Blues is based on the I-IV-V chordal progression, meaning the principal chord movement is from the home key, say A major to that of the fourth interval being D, to that of a resolution from the fifth interval being E, and of course the 'blues scale' is at the heart of the progression involving the minor 7th interval (the modus diaboli according to the church). Some would say this Blues form is very simple, however it should be remembered that even complex works by such as J.S Bach often were based on equally simple frameworks, merely elaborated by musical extension. The objective of music is to evoke an emotional/intellectual response in the listener, if this can be achieved with few notes played beautifully then the musician has been successful - complexity is not a merit in, and of itself. This being said, there are few guitar players who can truly play Blues with genuine feel and intent, there are many who can execute the blues scale, and emulate a blues sound-but when you hear the 'real thing' it is obvious. A skilled and gifted blues guitar player seeks to always express the emotional content of the song, if that means using discipline and economy then that is applied-sometimes a more ostentatious style is called for and many notes and technique is then provided (Robben Ford, Larry Carlton, Eric Clapton Buddy Guy, Shuggie Otis are notable players with this variation of playing style). Same with Metal players, this genre has many exponents who are gifted, practiced and brilliant guitar players - it is a matter of personal taste if you 'like' the music but its technical merit must be acknowledged. But no, Metal & blues guitar players are not necessarily 'better' or more technical than guitar players of other genres, such as Flamenco, Classical, Folk, Jazz Et Al. It is a category mistake to consider different style and genres of music as being 'better', or players of particular styles as being more proficient. It is probably wise to simply appreciate all styles of music as well as you can, and know that music is a variable art form, but you do not have to like everything! ",

I've heard from great metal Guitarists like James Hetfield, Tony Iommi, and Eddie Van Halen.  I've heard from great classical Guitarists like Julian Bream, John Williams, and Andres Segovia. I don't know if BB King could play Leyenda.  I don't know if Slash can play Autumn leaves. I don't know if Joe Pass could play Eruption.  I don't know if Stevie Ray Vaughn could play summertime. I don't know if James Hetfield can play Wild Horses.  I do know that all of these Guitarists contributed something amazing to the guitar repertoire.

            "answer_text": "As others have stated, sticking a musician in a different stylistic element will create a bad fish out of water situation. A better (more objective) question is what is the learning curve like for different styles. I would argue that blues is one of the quicker styles to gain passable proficiency. Metal seems to attracts more virtuoso's, but there are many passable players out there who have not been involved with the genre too long. In jazz, classical and flamenco, it can take many years until a person is considered decent. There is typically much more studying involved with these forms. Conversely, there are a lot of great blues players who are self-taught. Self-taught classical guitarists are the exception - I agree that many of them would sound terrible hacking their way through a standard blues progression. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a very wrong-headed question. Genre makes little difference - in fact, elite guitarists are quite adept at most every genre and could easily play jazz, blues, metal, or anything else at an elite level. Single-genre guitarists never grow to this level. However, each genre has its own style of guitar, so I'll speak briefly to that: Metal guitar tends to be the fastest and most technically advanced style of guitar.Jazz guitar tends to be the most musically complex in terms of harmony and progression (and can often give metal a run for its money in technical complexity as well).Blues guitar tends to be the most emotionally expressive style. This one may just be my opinion, come to think of it.Each genre has its own stylistic hook, so to speak, and guitarists striving for elite skill would do well to add each and every one of those tools to their repertoire.
