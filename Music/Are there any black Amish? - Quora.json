            "answer_text": "I can think of three Amish people that I know exist or have existed. Nearly my entire extended family is Amish, and one time I saw an old black Amish man at a family gathering. He had the full Amish getup, long silver beard, black cap, and sleek overalls. I was little back then, but I still freaked out a little. It was just so rare! Turns out he was adopted from a South American country of some sort, and was risen Amish. Many Mennonites and some Amish are connected to Belize, leading me to believe that he is from Belize, but I\u2019m not sure. Another example is of the well-known Alan Beiler from the T.V. show \u2018Amish Mafia\u2019. This show has so many false projections of the Amish, don\u2019t even get me started. But Alan has to be one of the fakest of them all. My dad personally knew Alan Beiler, and he has told me many times that the true Alan is not the same as the one on the screen, though he was raised Amish. I can\u2019t seem to find how Alan entered the Amish church, but he was most likely adopted into an Amish family. Speaking of which, my dad has said that if Alan\u2019s Amish father could see what he was doing, he\u2019d probably have a mental breakdown. The last example is present in my family\u2019s heritage. My extended family on my mother\u2019s side bears the surname,\u201dJones\u201d. If you were to open an Amish heritage book, Jones would be the last one to find on a list of surnames. This is because years ago, a young Amish girl became acquaintance with a black farmhand. No, he wasn\u2019t a slave, the Amish family in this case did not own any black slaves. So the young Amish girl became pregnant with this farmhand\u2019s baby, and she rose him amish. Afterwards, the girl married a white Amish man and since had a large family, the oldest of them being mixed. The rest of the children had a different surname, probably Yoder but the one black child in this family was left with the Jones name. This ancestor of mine stayed in the Amish church, and had many children, who had many, many more children. This has led to the Jones Family which appears other wise normal Amish family. We had a recent reunion which consisted of a few hundred people. All from Mr. Jones many years ago. ",

            "answer_text": "In a small Ohio town roughly 25 miles from me, there are some biracial children whose mother apparently left the church, bore them and then returned later in life. They are, sadly, a minor curiosity in that town and at least the oldest (to my understanding) has left the church and the area due to prejudice and the lack of opportunities. The Amish nearly always marry within their faith when they remain in their church. And the ones who leave the church often retain many of the sect\u2019s attitudes towards minorities which aren\u2019t progressive to put it very nicely. Additionally, the Amish church doesn\u2019t proselytize so they don\u2019t attract new members from the outside. If they did, again with the social views held by the current members, it\u2019s unlikely that they would seek out Black or African American acolytes as that would result in intermarriage and thus \u201cInterbreeding.\u201d ",

There was a rumour floating around the Amish community I lived in that there was a black Amish bishop in Pennsylvania somewhere, but I never knew if it was true or not. I've also heard that sometimes an Amish couple will adopt black children, but that the children almost always leave. I don't know how true that is either. Your best bet would probably be to ask a chatty employee in an Amish store or harness shop in an Amish community somewhere. Take everything with a grain of salt however because Amish love to gossip. They also like to trick ignorant tourists. ",

It's very rare for outsiders to join them because of their radically different lifestyle. You're more likely to see a black conservative Mennonite (I know one personally), but there aren't very many of them. The same thing applies to many other ethnic groups such as the Chinese and Arabs. In fact, I think black Mennonites are more common than the other two ethnicities I mentioned. EDIT: As was pointed out in a comment below, where there are black conservative Mennonites, they\u2019re most likely adopted. This happens from time to time. Another reason for low black conversion rates is that conservative Mennonites and the Amish tend to avoid settling in cities, where many black people live. ",

Very few outsiders join the Amish culture to begin with. The vast majority of Amish are the children of Amish, who were children of Amish\u2026 and they come from white stock in Eastern Europe generations ago. Also, Amish live in rural communities whereas most blacks live in urban areas, and the Amish do not usually make efforts to bring in any new people to their communities. ",
