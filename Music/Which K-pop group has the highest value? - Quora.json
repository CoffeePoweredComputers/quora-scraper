            "answer_text": "That\u2019s pretty easy. It\u2019s none other than BTS. Their most recent album, Map of the Soul: Persona has recorded the most sales for a kpop album. In terms of concert sales, their most recent Love Yourself World Tour brought in more than one million fans worldwide and generated more than US$71.7 million in ticket sales. Their popularity is at its peak and it\u2019s no wonder they are the richest kpop group as of now. Forbes even ranked them 43rd in the article which included Top 100 richest people of 2018 (or 2019 perhaps). Followed by BTS are Twice, BlackPink, TVXQ, EXO, Seventeen, Wanna One, Red Velvet and GOT7 (in order). ",

Some groups are doing EXTREMELY well in America, while other groups are well known in say, China or Japan. It really all just depends from WHICH country viewpoint you are looking from and what kind of \u201cvalue\u201d you're asking about. Is it monetary value? Networth? Most talent (which in that case, completely subjective), best looks? Like what do you mean by \u201cvalue\"? ",
