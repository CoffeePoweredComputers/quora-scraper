            "answer_text": "Well, I live in Bhojpur and have experienced the way things work here. Few things, which I think, govern the music which comes out of here are:- Heavy Patriarchy:- It's a truth that here in Bhojpur, patriarchy rules without fears of coup. Whether it's a matter of elections or music, choices of females always go through the consent of males. Though the system is gradually changing for good.But in music industry, objectification has no rival at all. Even the female singers and musicians don't protest against it for they know that they 'd lose their mic forever.The Audience:- Good music originates from a critical audience. If we take the example of bollywood in 90s, had it not been people's embrace for Rahman, our music would have collapsed into mediocrity of formula based love songs with all sorts of instruments playing in background.Audience in Bhojpur is unsophisticated. It doesn't matters to them whether the song they are listening has it's tune copied from a bollywood song or it's original.Most of the songs are there for entertainment and dance. And it's so much copied that calling them parody would be better.The Bhojpuri Pride:- A lot of songs are made (copied, they are the same here) on this topic. Songs like these, most of the times, choose the wrong way of depicting the pride.If you hear the lyrics of these brand of songs (proceed at your own risk), you' d find that the singer is so much into pride that he comes onto some serious eve teasing and takes it for granted that the girl has no word to say for he is \u2018Bhojpuriya Sher' (Lion of Bhojpur).This kind of the pride makes it difficult for them to accept their mistakes and be open for some good music and lyrics.Music companies such as Wave and T Series won't encourage anything experimental for that would not fit into the hit formula of bhojpuri songs which is :- [math]\\text {Hit Song} = \\text {Pawan Singh} \u00d7 {\\text {Cleavage}}^2 \u00d7 \\text {Double Meaning Lyrics}[/math] You won't believe but it's true that the music here has caste divides too. A song from Pawan Singh is the one for the upper castes and a one from Khesari Lal Yadav traces its hit potential down the social ladder. Pawan Singh apart, I see none in the film industry who even knows how to sing. The female voices are woefully autotuned and sound extremely annoying. Good singers don' t want to get into this business for they know the kind of things they ' d be singing once they get into it. There is basically a drought of music composers and lyricists and the audience too is trying to cover up the drought with piss. But amidst all these negative aspects there are some positives too! As soon as you direct your ears towards the richness of Bhojpuri Folk, you would find lyrical gems and singing masterclasses. Bhikhari Thakur, Bharat Sharma, Vishnu Ojha and few others have gifted some blissful folk to the listeners. Though their nirguns and bhajans don't find any ears but the old ones. It's the clearest of all facts related to music that until you have audience which listens good you can't sing good and even if you do, you' d fade as if you never existed. ",

            "answer_text": "Because singers in Bhojpuri, most of them, are into victimising poor by selling sleazy content. The language Bhojpuri is now left with poor undereducated and underprivileged class. The educated middle class upper caste people of Bihar and UP have left their mother tongue and entered in Hindi. So bhojpuri has no one to take care. ",
