            "answer_text": "There are various kinds of modulations. The most common kind is modulating by shared chords: First you have to think from the end backwards: you want to arrive at A major (in which measure?). So find a chord that precedes A major and has a strong tendency to move into it \u2013 a dominant chord is the most common solution. Now you can either use the dominant as it is (for A this would be E major) or you can use chord substituting the dominant, like the Bb dominant chord (a tritone substitution). Next you go back further: which chord would nicely lead into E dominant or Bb dominant (or whatever you picked in above)? You could pick chord a fifth away, like Bm oder B7 (for E). But E dominant is also pretty close to E minor, so you could simply turn your E minor into an E major by raising the third (maybe with a nice melody movement into it). That\u2019s just one possibility to modulate by using shared chords. The principles are always the same: build it backwards from your goal and use circle of fifth motion (cadences). I mentioned there are many other kinds of modulation. Some are: Common tone modulation let\u2019s a single note ring from a chord in the original key (D major in your case) and then coming in with a chord in the new key with the same note. In your case you could end on E from E minor, let it stand alone, and then come in with A major (or precede that with E dominant if you want), using the common tone E. Sudden modulation takes no preparation. The whole purpose is to move to a different key unexpectedly. In your case, the new key is closely related to the old key, so a sudden modulation what probably just sound like shared chord or common tone modulation. There are more types of modulation, but I don\u2019t want to bore you with every possibility ;). Hope that helped a little bit. ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to change keys from D major to A major, the most sonically pleasing way to do this is by using one of the chords that is common to both keys, often called a \u201cpivot chord\u201d. In the case of A and D, the pivot chords are Dmaj, Amaj and Bmin. Here is how each of these chords function in both keys: D major: D = I, A = V, Bm = vi A major: A = I, Bm = ii, D = IV I hope this is helpful. ",
