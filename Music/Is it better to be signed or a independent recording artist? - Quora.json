            "answer_text": "That depends upon your perspective\u2026 and what you are trying to accomplish\u2026 and how much of your hard earned money you want the label to take away from you\u2026 and how much control they will have over you in your early recording career with the label. And they will control your content to some degree. Just as they will fleece you of money they think they deserve for promoting and \u201csupporting\u201d you\u2026 though they need YOU for them to continue to exist. Weigh this against being independent. You won\u2019t necessarily get good advertising promotion, and if you\u2019re self produced, unless YOU buy the advertising, it ain\u2019t gonna happen. But you will control all your content, how it sounds, and the visual appeal of the record packaging, what it looks like. And you will need a manager to go out and get you gigs in good clubs and or concert venues. The concert venues you may have to pay for, including security and other things. Your manager can try to hook you into a tour with a \u201cname\u201d act as an opener. You can then get to the venue, wait for the main act to do their sound check, then set up and get a few minutes\u2019 time to get levels. And if you don\u2019t have a sound guy who knows his stuff, you will have to use the house or other band\u2019s sound guy\u2026 who, if he is a jerk, will not work to make you sound good. But if he\u2019s a square shooter (buy him coffee or dinner for helping you out ), he\u2019ll make you sound good\u2026 as long as you\u2019re not better than the main act! :O Anyway, either way you go, there is a price to pay. One lets you do it your way. The other requires you to kowtow to label demands\u2026 until or unless you prove to be capable of directing your own fate because you\u2019ve proven you know what you\u2019re doing and that you know your audience.

            "answer_text": "In the beginning it\u2019s probably best to be independent, if you can afford to cover your own studio time, mastering, packaging and release, which even done on a budget will be in excess of $20k ..but ultimate the goal is to get signed. An artist can\u2019t do it all! Just be careful of contracts, just because you get a million dollar record deal doesn\u2019t mean you will be grossing money, because that million will be paid off first to cover studio time, promotion etc. Get a good outside entertainment attorney of your own and never sign or agree to anything without their consent. I have seen artists being stubborn thinking they are worth way more than they really are, only to hold out and be left with nothing. I\u2019ve also seen groups like N Sync, TLC, Back Street Boys falling into some pretty crappy deals, which only net them about $50k/year even after going platinum. ",
