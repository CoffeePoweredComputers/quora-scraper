If you are referring to a movie in a theater, the theater might have the speakers turned up wrong. Often there is a standard level for each channel, but if it was set up wrong, it can affect the overall sound. If it\u2019s a YouTube video or something similar, the person mixing it probably used headphones, or mixed in a bad environment and didn\u2019t get a good sense of the environment. ",
