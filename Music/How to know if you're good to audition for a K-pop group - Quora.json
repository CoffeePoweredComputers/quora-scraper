            "answer_text": "VISUALS. Ok everyone knows that there are \u2018ugly\u2019 idols and \u2018gorgeous\u2019 idols. But at the end of the day, the \u2018ugly\u2019 ones are still really, really good looking. Yeah so make sure that you\u2019re more or less visually appealing and you\u2019re 10% safe.ASIAN BLOOD. Yes. I mean it. If you\u2019re full white/black/hispanic/european (no racism pls don't attack) then I really think the idol life isn\u2019t cut out for you. There have been 3 (known) non-Asian idols and they didn't really make it that far into their career. One of the 3 (a male idol) didn\u2019t even get to debut. Another one was only put in the group because the company wanted to show their racial diversity, and she barely got center chreography (or lines), and not to mention she wasn\u2019t treated very pleasantly either. The group was (more or less) a flop. If you wish to know the group, it\u2019s RANIA (previously BP RANIA, but they were renamed after the non-Asian girl left). So if you\u2019re non-Asian and wish to be a k-idol, do be prepared to face racism and discrimination in DPRK S.TALENT. This too. But of course the musical aspect is pretty vague as anyone can speak a little quickly in a \u2018nice\u2019 accent, get their company to autotune it, and their fans will call it \u2018fire\u2019. That ^ is for rapping only. For singing, well it would be awesome if you're not tone deaf, or just really off tune 24/7. You just need to be able to sing a song decently enough. Then again it\u2019s also very generic as both vocals depend on what company you want to join and what they focus on (talent, visuals etc.).A little extra for you: NO KOREABOOS. Yeet. Don\u2019t go into the audition going like \u201cannyeonghaseyo, _______ imnida.\u201d or \u201ckamsahamnida\u201d. jeez. Just no. The company won't appreciate it, and whoever is monitoring the audition may think you\u2019re just a wannabe, or even worse, a disrespectful person. Just speak in your native language. Don't worry! Nobody\u2019s going to judge you, just give it your all!ETIQUETTE. Need I emphasise?",
