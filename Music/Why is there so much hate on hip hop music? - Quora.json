            "answer_text": "There are 3 main reasons: Racism, sexism, and the general public. To start off, many are racist. Hip hop have whites and other race people prefer than blacks. Many dont like blacks because the stereotype that black sing about dumb stuff and sex. Not every rapper are that. One bad apple ruins the whole bunch. Many hated blacks as it is and they use hip hop to strengthen their racism. THEN there is the general public. But let me talk about sexism first. Im not gonna say today hip hop trash but i dont like it. I like the Biggie, 2pac, A little of Little Kim even tho i dont like her, Some of Lil Wayne, Ice cube, Kevin Gates, Maybe Drake, Missy Elliot, Eminem, And Nicki Minaj. Some might not like my preference but thet bring me alot of nostalgia. The 90s-2015 was the best eras with more truth and passion. But over time, sex has risen. Today ppl like sex and sex topic. Hip hop dont mean alot anymore. Its all money and sex talk. Many hate hip hop because the women. Alot say women ruined hip hop, they are untalented, and should stay at home cooking and cleaning. Sexist, i know. The men talk about sex ALOT tho but is accepted because its said to be normal for men and men are suppose to be hyper-sexual but hip hop get more hate when women talk about sex. Some are sexist. Its all \u201c they just brag about getting eating out\u201d or \u201c having sex\u201d. However men dont get called out when they talk about \u201chitting from the back, eating women out, and getting head.\u201d Anyways, sex is what sells tho. Half of the GP is Men. Men\u2026alot prefer seeing a woman stripping, getting naked and being promiscuous. They dony wanna hear her rap but her body but they have no choice too because they know the woman will strip. They came for the sexy part not the bars. You gotta know thats what the general public who are the audience prefer. I know a talented rapper name Dej Loaf who dont get alot of praise/attention because she dont brag about sex and wear \u201cprovocative\u201d clothing compared to Cardi B or Nicki because of their fake butts, and twerking..that made them more viewed. I love Nicki but i will admit that part. In hip hop, to be successful, you gotta shake ur butt, and be sexual to succeed which The GP like, who are 96 percent men. Its not their-the women fault. Hip hop switch their flaws to entertain whats marketing. If they dont fit with whats desired currently, the artist isnt gonna progress. But that gets ALOT of hate from the 90s bbys who arent used to it, feminists, sexist ppl and the hypocrited who preferred that sexual behavior. Hip hop hatred flows through racism-sexism-general public ruining it. Its really sad. Even tho the rappers talented, their work is manipulated and hated by the same ppl. **Would love to see your opinion, views and comments. Enlighten me if u want** ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I don't really HATE hip hop music in the real sense of the word \u201cHATE\u201d\u2026 For me, oftentimes if I happen to go with some hip hop song, usually then I find myself irritated and disheartened and disinterested \u2026 And bored? Yeah bored.. Not because hip hop isn't awesome or something. It's just that I feel the magic of it is having a very shameful death.. While I do enjoy fusion music genres like contemporary R&B, where you can have that jazz feel and hip hop, etc. I don't really find contemporary hip hop songs are worth listening to. While there are some artists to whom I do listen. Like kayne west, Eminem, Drake, etc. I don't really listen them on daily basis. Just occasionally \u2026 Just sometimes.. When I wanna have something different in head. Think about it, why would I be listening to those immature jerks who sing in a way that looks like they even dunno a single word they are uttering, who look like complete fools and dumbest and who think self deceivingly that it makes them somehow look more cool as artists. (it's subjective view by the way) who are just boasting endlessly something very stupid that one can't understand. I have to listen carefully to their each line to understand what they just said. Not that what they are singing is something of kantian philosophy or of great complexity. It's just pure shit uttered in childish manner of blabbering. It's really hard (or at least I find it so hard) to understand a word of what they are singing (which doesn't sound like singing at all) apart from few lines that they keep repeating as if they hold some golden meaning engraved. Most of the songs and their lyrics are just complete trash. Songs about drugs and bars and what not \u2026 Yes.. There are songs, yeah, hip hop songs, which are really great. I'm not denying that. For sure. I do like some aspects of this genre, like those witty lyrics n all.. And even sometimes I do need and I mean really NEED to have hip hop ringing in my head.. But it's only Sometimes \u2026sometimes.. though looking at its contemporary state, I find it dull and \u2026 well I have already described how I feel about it. So yeah. That's it\u2026 ",
