            "answer_text": "Miley Cyrus is the daughter of musician Billy Ray Cyrus, who is popular for his one hit wonder song \u201cAchy Breaky Heart\" now Miley wasn't her original name at birth, it was actually Destiny Hope Cyrus.  She was given the nickname Miley because she used to smile a lot, it was originally \u201cSmiley\" as in \u201csmiley face\" and then just \u201cMiley\" which was how she got that name. In 2003 she started her career as an actress and had a few small appearances in some television shows as a child.  But her big break came in 2006 from when she got the role as Hannah Montana in the television series produced by Disney of the same name as a teenager as both herself and her alter ego Hannah Montana as a high school student and a teenage pop singer : This was how Miley got popular    As a result of the popularity Cyrus got from Hannah Montana in the late 2000s and early 2010s she transitioned into a music career based on the popularity of the Hannah Montana character :   Then after the Hannah Montana show ended, she continued her music career but without the Disney image and just as plain old Miley Cyrus from that point on :  Then in the mid 2010s (which is 6 years ago now) from 2012 until 2016 (two years ago) Miley cut off her long hair and started doing these crazy, provocative wacky out of control sexually explicit things that caused a lot of controversy such as sticking her tongue out, shaking her ass and running around in public half naked exposing herself :          Miley stopped doing this in more recent years as of 2016 and has gone back to the way she was post Hannah Montana before she started doing the extreme sexual stuff and grew her long hair back and thank goodness for that because that was a nightmare, those crappy days are over :  ",
