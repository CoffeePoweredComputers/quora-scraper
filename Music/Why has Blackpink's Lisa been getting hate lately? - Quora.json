            "answer_text": "I know this was in 2019 but I\u2019m still going to take the chance to reply. Skinny-Shaming: Both Lisa and Rose did get hate for how skinny they were. Many had different perspectives on it. The most popular was stating that this was not a healthy weight or even saying Lisa and Rose were the skinniest idols. (Which is not true, I\u2019ve seen multiple idols who were underweight.) The problem in Korea is they take weight for Idols seriously. You can\u2019t be too overweight or else thats considered not good enough. Oh! You lost weight? That\u2019s not healthy. I hope Korean netizens calm down a bit.Culture: As you know, Lisa is Thai. However, she took 3\u20134 (I think) to learn Korean. Before that, when she came into Korea the only word she knew was hello. It was difficult for her to cope with everyone else in the company. To the main point now: Netizens hated on her because of her being Thai and she was not considered \u201cKorean Standards\u201d. Multiple comments directed her comparing her looks to Russian elfs. (and more).Liking: People seem to take an interest in Lisa due to her dance skills. (dancing machine). They compare her to other big dancers and say she\u2019s the best dancer blah blah. (i MEAN LIKE A GIRL GOTTA SLAY) Lisa is a good dancer\u2026but when you compare this girl to other dancers. They aren\u2019t on the same level. Solo stans gotta chill. BUT LUV YOU LISA!Thoughts: Netizens hate on other idols who aren\u2019t Korean and saying racist comments but when some groups use different culture objects in their music videos they are considered raciest. Being racist means showing discrimination against people of other races. (example of whats going now). This is why the Kpop world is cruel. THIS IS NOT HATE DIRECTED TO LISA! I LOVE EVERY SINGLE MEMBER! I AM NOT A SOLO STAN NOR AM I THAT TYPE OF PERSON. ",

            "answer_text": "The reasons she receive hate is already answered and I think that is really accurate. Personally, I don't hate her but I'm kinda getting repelled by all the hype she has been receiving so we can just say it's not her whom I dislike but the people who overhype her. Jennie previously received hate for overshadowing the other members but I think Lisa is doing the exact same thing right now but don't worry people won't hate her like they hate Jennie, yass coz Jennie is a bitch and Lisa is not?(Fight me Jennie haters) Phrases like \u201cShe's the best dancer or rapper in kpop\u201d just don't hold right. People saying these are either very narrow minded or have very little knowledge about kpop. In a nutshell, I hate solo stans of Lisa who are just too much! I like Lisa but I'm staying far away from overhyping her coz that'll only make me look like a fool. Peace\u270c\ud83c\udffb ",
