Having said that \u2026it will cause so much frustration that it may as well come with the dust already on it. Bad Bad Bad design that is sure to disappoint. \u2022 I test drove one at a job for two -2 hour sets. \u2022ENTIRELY counter productive in every aspect to making LIVE music. \u2022Requires a great deal of fiddling. No functions are available by button or in a menu screen unless you use and iPad or iOS device \u2026.just what we need \u2026a piano that REQUIRES you to use you phone!!! \u2022 MISSING are ANY markings for instrument selection, touch/reverb parameters. \u2022PERMANENT SPLIT POINT -E3 or E4 -forget \u2026but they clearly state it is not moveable \u2026one of the MOST BASIC features of a digital piano. The only reason I\u2019d accept one if given to me for free is to sell it. Yamaha tends to over complicate things from a professional performer\u2019s pov. There are many other digital pianos in this price range that run circles around this in terms of flexibility, ease of use, touch, and tone. \u201cWhich ones,\u201d I must refrain from mentioning except by private message because I\u2019m not interested in debating which brand is better than what. These are purely subjective and highly charged topics and it\u2019s like asking \u201cWhat\u2019s the best car?\u201d \u2026.simple answer? NOT at all. Price, performance, where it is to be driven and who is driving. Pianos are very much like cars in many respects from the trade-in allowances, maintenance (tune ups) agreements to the people who deal them \u2026it is an industry that polishes its public persona by pretending to sell refinement, quality & sophistication \u2026perhaps that is true in the Manhattan Steinway store \u2026but not in general -they will saddle you with ANYTHING just to make the sale. If you don\u2019t know pianos, jewellery, furs etc \u2026KNOW YOUR DEALER \u2026apology to any used car dealers. I found this post when I Googled \u201cWho is this piano designed for?\u201d Sincerely xoxo :) ",

            "answer_text": "For a basic digital piano, this model seems to provide it all with a nice price as well compared to the other model of the same series and other series. It all depends on what type of music pieces you play and how far are you going to be playing. For beginners of classical music, the YDP 143 with the GHS keys should satisfy the basic requirement, but as you go further, the one with the better keyboard action may be better. When compared to the real acoustic piano which has wooden key with ivory tops, the feel is quite different from an entry and mid level keyboard, which may feels more \u201chollow\u201d and \u201cplasticky\u201d. The more you have access to acoustic pianos to be playing on them, they more you would be able to feel the difference between them and the entry to mid level digital pianos even other brands. I took classical piano lessons for over 5 years back in the 80\u2019s and survived on a 5 octave , non velocity sensitive keyboard to even managed to get the highest distinction grades at some exams on the real acoustic piano. Differences between GH, GHS, GH3 and NW Key Action All the other requirements you mentioned of recording, polyphony and build quality are there in all reputable brands like Yamaha. If you are not into other types of music other than just pure piano solos to be played at home, then this model is good enough. For me, I was influenced greatly by synthesizers such that I like the diversity of playing other types of sounds and styles with a band as accompaniment in addition to piano solos, and to have the flexibility of moving my keyboard as I played in a band to bring my own keyboard for practice and performances outside the house. The bad part about it, is the cables needed to connect it and having no speakers built-in on the higher models that have all the bells and whistles. But that\u2019s my personal preference to be able to play a piano solo piece with the possibility of adding some background instrument of strings or an entire orchestra/band. I\u2019ve tried the midi controller M-Audio Keystation 88es and I didn\u2019t like the feel at all. Thus if it\u2019s going to be an instrument you want to be playing once a while, this model should do, but if you want to be using it for something that you would passionately play on for longer time, a higher model would bring more enjoyment on what you hear and feel, and also if your budget allows it. In general, Yamaha is a very good brand and their products can be trusted. So far, I\u2019ve had mostly Yamaha digital pianos and keyboard from them such that my current set up is a Motif XF8 and a Tyros 5 placed above it. My passion to play them with the satisfaction of the keyboard feels and sounds, has pushed me to get their top of the line of their synthesizer and arranger series. If you want to have some bells and whistles which offer a range of different sounds and one man band style at the same price range of the Arius YDP 143, the DGX 660 package offers them as I see on US seller Kraftmusic from whom I got my Tyros bundle package : Yamaha DGX-660 Portable Grand Digital Piano - Black COMPLETE HOME BUNDLE PLUS. But if the bells and whistles are not in your interest, then the Arius should be fine. ",
