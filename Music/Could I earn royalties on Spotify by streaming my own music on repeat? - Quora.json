            "answer_text": "You won\u2019t earn exactly what you\u2019d expect, but you might earn something. The royalty calculations are a lot more complicated than a straight up amount per stream. The thing though is that Spotify is pretty good at detecting fraudulent streaming scenarios, and if you played a song or album on repeat for a month, you\u2019d definitely get noticed. If it looked like you were just trying to cheat the system, you might get your user banned and the streams of your track zeroed out. For the record, we knew about Sleepify pretty quickly (Spotify employees are music fans, of course, and read the music blogs and track bands too). We let it go as long as we thought was reasonable. Even if we hadn\u2019t seen it on social media early on, we would have caught it soon when a band came out of nowhere tracking up a ton of repeat listenings on a single album. Spotify wouldn\u2019t let this happen again, most likely. ",

Spotify can work out if an artist is abusing the system, and they can take your music down if you are doing something that goes against what they deem fair usage. From a moral perspective, reaching 1,000 or more plays organically and legitimately is much more satisfying anyway. You also need to think about it as an active live performer if you do so. Imagine if you have 25,000 plays on one song but the attendances at your shows don\u2019t reflect the song\u2019s popularity \u2014 promoters, venues and booking agents will stop booking you for shows. Instead you can pitch your music to playlist curators to help your song\u2019s plays increase organically. This will also help you potentially reach new fans. Be careful though as some curators buy followers to make their playlist look more popular than it is, then charge you to feature on it \u2014 do not ever pay to appear on a playlist as this will likely not see your song gain any organic plays or generate any royalties.

If you choose to hire a Soundcloud promotion agency, it might do a couple of things with your tracks: Repost your song on one or more channels (owned exclusively by the agency); Share your tracks through many \u201cfeeder\u201d accounts; Send many accounts to boost your listens, generate reposts and increase other credibility measures.
