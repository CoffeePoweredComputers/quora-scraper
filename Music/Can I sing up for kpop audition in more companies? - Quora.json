            "answer_text": "yes! actually it is advised you audition in several companies if u really aspire to become an idol!! it will increase your chances to get accepted in at least one of them. it will be taxing and incredibly difficult and you have to be extremely patient! but definitely for the best! many successful idols have gone through various stages of auditions !! but please be sure of what company you want to audition in. all different agencies look for different talents ! SM is based on looks mainly and then talent ( you never see anyone ugly there) , JYP is mainly based on dance although if u have the passion and attitude to be an idol , along with a talent you have good choices as JYP values them most! YG emphasises on skils and you must be prepared to train for a very long time to debut ! especially since YG believes in hard work and training ! each company has their own styles and values!! i hope this helps!!
