            "answer_text": "Yes, depending on what you count as professional. If you mean is there a \u201cmajor league\u201d for this sport, that would have to go to Drum Corps International. Don\u2019t call these groups marching bands; they are drum corps. They march specialized horns\u2014all brass, no woodwinds. They also have an age limit (typically 21) and a limit to the number of members (currently 154)[1] of any one group. Here\u2019s a tiny sample of the kind of work they do, but there is no way your computer screen and speakers can capture the impact of a live show. I encourage you to attend an event in person if ever you get the chance.  If you mean \u201cgetting paid,\u201d then for all their skill and effort, DCI groups might not count. Many have the enthusiastic support of makers of instruments and equipment, but I don\u2019t think the musicians get paid to participate. Some pro sports teams have marching bands, which I presume do get paid. The San Francisco 49ers have, at the least, a drum line.  Some theme parks have marching bands as part of their show:  The U.S. armed forces have marching bands. Here\u2019s one of the Air Force bands in a parade. (There are many videos and recordings, and most are better than this. I was looking for some actual marching. They get to playing more than just the drum cadence after most have gone past this video camera.)  And at least one group, Blast, has taken the drum and bugle corps show elements indoors, expanded and interpreted rather broadly, and is touring the production:  Footnotes[1] DCI 2018 Rule Changes Cheat Sheet",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a fantastic question! It is a little bit tricky to answer though so I will do my best to explain. Professional in the sense that you get paid to be a member of a marching band sure! Every branch of the military has a band, and they get paid to perform. It might not be marching band in the same sense as high school but still paid performers. The closest thing to it is probably going to be Drum Corps International or DCI. Even though everyone involved has to pay to join and participate they would probably be the marching band equivalent to say the NBA for basketball. Last but not least is the only actual \u201cprofessional\u201d marching band event I can truly think of. It\u2019s called the Virginia International Tattoo, it is truly an incredible experience for anyone who enjoys marching band. Here is a blog that talks about it in more detail Take Your Students To Virginia Beach | Kaleidoscope Adventures ",
