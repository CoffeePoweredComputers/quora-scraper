I found that if I let my mind go elsewhere, I still paid attention to the road, l could hear and see if the children were not behaving. It worked. Take your thoughts to a good place. To this day someone will think lm listening to some conversation, lm not. If you let your mind go to someone else's conversation, then you want to hear! Get a book, tell yourself your not interested, pay attention elsewhere or get away from the conversation. ",

            "answer_text": "If possible, inconspicuously put distance between yourself and them. If the scenario is close seating in a restaurant, though for example; discreetly inform the staff that the patrons who are being overheard by you, appear to be excessively inebriated and it's freaking you out and making every other surrounding seated diner uncomfortable. Suggest to the staff to ask the group to kindly leave. Don't let another loud mouthed motherfucker replace them because that would be counterproductive of the goal. ",
