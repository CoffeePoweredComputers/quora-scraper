            "answer_text": "Simple, because you haven\u2019t sung in a while. Too keep a good voice you need to practice constantly, train your voice, and you can\u2019t just not sing for a long time and expect to be good like you where before. If you haven\u2019t sung in a while that means you\u2019ve lost your ability to sing good now because you haven\u2019t been practicing with it. The thing about a voice is when singing you need to practice a lot, it\u2019s not easy, and a good singing voice needs atention, you can\u2019t just stop singing and expect it to be good like before. If you really want to restore your sining ability then practice a lot. All about practice. A tip while sining though is use your diaphragm to breath. The way you do that is breath in with your diaphragm first, then your chest, then breath out with your chest, then your diaphragm to maximize the air you have if you don\u2019t know what a diaphragm is look it up, I don\u2019t know either all I know is how to use it for breathing and I know air goes in and out through it and it\u2019s somewhere around your belly button area inside of u; another thing is if you really want to restore your voice you can do it, but it\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s actually a lot of work and practice. Try voice lessons or practice with hard songs that are in your voice range so it doesn\u2019t hurt your vocal chords. ",
