            "answer_text": "Do you mean will we run out of new styles, or do you mean will we run out of melodies? If you're talking about the former, that's a tricky one because originality and what constitutes a \u201cstyle\" is subject to opinion, and, although I don't fully agree with Alex Johnston when he says in his answer that it can be guaranteed that someone somewhere will have made music that sounds like yours no matter how new you think yours seems (how similar is similar, how do you actually guarantee this, define \u2018original\u2019 etc), everyone that is trying to make music is perched on a giant's shoulder, so to speak. Melody is a different thing. If somebody writes a melody that is the same or very similar to one already in copyright it can be proved - a melody can be notated in a way that a \u201ckind\u201d of music can't. There is a YouTube video by Vsauce that talks about this called \u201cwill we ever run out of new music?\u201d. I'd provide a link if I knew how the hell to do it, but basically they conclude that, given the 12 notes and the different rhythms they can be ordered into - well, suffice to say that if they're right we won't be running out of tunes any time soon . . .

            "answer_text": "Let me answer that question with another question: What would you rather do: a.) create new music which doesn\u2019t sound like anything else but which nobody likes, or b.) create music which resembles existing music but which people can connect with, and which moves them enough that they love it? The point, in case I haven\u2019t made it sufficiently clear, is not to sacrifice everything that makes music powerful, moving and effective for the sake of mere \u2018newness\u2019. The point is to connect with people using music. In the meantime, I guarantee you that no matter what music anyone makes, someone somewhere has already made music that resembles it, even if you\u2019ve never heard it. Get over it. Only connect. ",
