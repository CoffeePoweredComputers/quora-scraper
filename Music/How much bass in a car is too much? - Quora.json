            "answer_text": "At the risk of pissing off all the \u201ccar stereo enthusiasts\u201d: If it\u2019s easily heard outside the car with closed windows at realistic volumes, it\u2019s too much. Yes, we get that it\u2019s the bestest music evah (according to you, and until some new fad comes through next week), but we still don\u2019t want to hear it. Not even just the bass part. And, from a legal perspective: If it\u2019s loud enough to impair your ability to hear emergency vehicles\u2019 sirens, other cars\u2019 horns and so on, it\u2019s too loud. ",
