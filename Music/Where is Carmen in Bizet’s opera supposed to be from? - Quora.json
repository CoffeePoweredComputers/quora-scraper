A smart tour guide will fill you in on how to avoid being pick-pocketed by them. Not a smear, but just the facts. Having experienced them in person made my connection to the opera much richer. I understood \u201cThe Card Song\u201d much better after seeing the \u201cgypsies\u201d face-to-face. I say that not as a cultural slam, but as a way of recognizing their 500-year history in Europe and an understanding of how they live and survive. On a tour in Italy, our tour guide gave us a deeply humane and informative synopsis on them and I\u2019m glad for it. To have a personal experience of the Roma and think of the female characters in the opera left me a bigger fan and a more humane person. ",
