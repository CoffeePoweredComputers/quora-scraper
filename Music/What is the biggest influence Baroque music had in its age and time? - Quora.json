            "answer_text": "It bears repeating that the eras of a cultural history are defined by commentators in retrospect; there really was no coordinated dawning of the Baroque, and thus it's difficult to speak about a unifying idea behind it, or a generative influence of singular importance. But in music, the Baroque was an especially precipitous time--the eon in which the lava of the Renaissance began to cool into the musical earth we know today, so to speak. One aesthetic that is commonly cited, and that's easy to see in the canvases and architecture of the period, is the desire to fill space often in an elaborately ornamented (but richly expressive) way. This trend can be considered as a reaction to the focuses on organized perspective and realism in the art of the Renaissance, as can the growing dominance of themes from classical mythology. The Baroque in music came about through the intersection of various historical factors. The Protestant Reformation was one of the biggest factors, as it led to the solidification of early modern Germanic society hungry for new bodies of sacred and civic music. The decline of feudal society and an increase in mercantile trade meant the development of distinct national schools of musical thought which, being distinct, could then enter into dialogue and influence with one another. The Baroque was also in a sense the real golden age of opera, in which opera venues began to proliferate and become a viable and sustainable outlet for composers, particularly in Italy and France. Baroque music from early on codified the major-minor tonal axis which had begun to emerge in the Renaissance, at the expense of modal tonality which would not return to art music in force until the early 20th century. This allowed possibilities for modulation and the development of key relationships, an interest that has dominated musical thought since. Even solemn sacred music came to be based in the forms and gestures of dance music, of a wider variety than in times past, with a near-universal emphasis on motor rhythms. Canonic imitation dominated German composition as a means of filling out space and driving musical ideas, while clearer textures coupled with partially improvised melodic ornamentation were more common outside the German-speaking world. And, finally, the establishment of civic and court orchestras and opera theatres created a template for standardized orchestration: a string band augmented with wind instruments and keyboards and perhaps some percussion. In a very real sense, Baroque sensibilities never left the world of Western art music. Music continued to be contrapuntal at its core and strongly tonal, even though those elements were somewhat stiffened, toned down, and placed in the service of other organizing principles with the advent of the more restrained and standardized practices of high classicism.
