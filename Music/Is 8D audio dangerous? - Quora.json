            "answer_text": "Absolutely not. The concept behind \u201c8D Audio\u201d is nothing new; there have been numerous experiments in changing the phase relation (and/or time delay) between signals reaching each of your ears in order to \u201cfool the brain\u201d into thinking that sounds are coming from different directions \u2014 (e.g., Carver\u2019s \u201cSonic Holography\u201d in some of their 1980s preamplifiers and receivers, or Mitsubishi\u2019s \u201cVirtual Surround Sound\u201d beam-forming in some of their big-screen LCD TVs). It\u2019s important to realize that the slight differences in timing between the arrival of sound from one ear to the other (combined with volume differences) is how we actually locate sound in everyday life. Creating the delays artificially (or through alternative mic placement) is no more dangerous than listening to recordings which have been augmented with a \u201cStereo Expander\u201d in the studio (which you\u2019ve probably done without realizing it) or listening to several conversations at once coming from different points at a party. While adding a number of additional delay lines (and some equalization) might confuse your brain a little bit more than a \u201cstandard stereo\u201d version, unless you have some strange form of epilepsy (or you\u2019re on very heavy drugs) you should be just fine listening to it \u2014 (or at worst, slightly uncomfortable) .

            "answer_text": "Is 8D audio dangerous? Dangerous?: no (not withstanding usual warnings about listening to anything too loudly or at all when your aural attention otherwise needs to be undivided. Interesting? (I will ask the question for you): Also, no. Actually I did not really know what this is until a couple of minutes ago. I went to following link:Why Are So Many Dudes Losing Their Shit Over 8D Audio? - MEL Magazine I listened to the embedded 8D version of Bohemian Rhapsody and couldn\u2019t make it all the way through. I was simply tedious. What this sounds like is a \u201cvocal eliminator\u201d is used to create create background tracks that have removed anything that is panned to the center (usually lead vocals and solos). Vocal Eliminator also effects the phase of those backing tracks, which sounds weird, but that is another issue. That is then mixed back with an auto-panning or modulated panning version of the full song to give the effect of the lead vocal/instrument moving back and forth while the backing tracks stay in-place. There could be more to it, but that is what it sounds like. In any case, it is a clown-house effect. I find it irritating and would think that anyone who WANTS to listen to music this way would not be my friend. ",
