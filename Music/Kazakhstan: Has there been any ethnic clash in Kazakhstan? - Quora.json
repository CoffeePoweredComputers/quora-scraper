            "answer_text": "There is no reported ethnic clashes nor crimes on ethnic basis in the past 20+ years. In other words, there were no reported ethnic problems in the independent Kazakhstan. So, either government hides such facts or they actually didn't happen. I personally haven't face any problems related to someones ethnicity, but I know there are some small problems, which basically came from illiterate or poorly educated people, so I doubt that ethnicity has anything to do with that. Also I think the maximum that can happen is a simple fight between two persons, which happens sometimes independently of any ethnic problems. So, there is a small friction between different nations sometimes, but I don't think that it is big enough to cause any major conflicts and ethnicity based hatred. Now I really want to talk about this article After Ukraine, Kazakhstan wary of ethnic Russians broaching autonomy provided here in Hongtao Zhang answer, because it is gibberish.  In the city of Kostanay in northern Kazakhstan, the ribbon of St George, a black-and-orange symbol of resurgent Russian patriotism that was adopted by separatists in Ukraine, hangs from every second car's rear-view mirror. Ribbon of Saint George for Kazakhstani people has nothing to do with Russian patriotism, that ribbon is mainly used during Victory Day (9 May) celebrations, and it's also used to show that you are proud of what someone did 50 years ago and so on. Some people also use it to show that they are supporting the Eastern Ukrainians in whatever. But I don't think anyone attach is to the car's rear-view mirror to show Kremlin that he is ready to rebel. That is ridiculous.  Most people in this town and the surrounding region are ethnic Russians, distinct from the mainly Muslim ethnic Kazakhs who are in the majority nationwide and control the main levers of power in this oil-producing former Soviet state. I really wish people will stop calling Kazakhstan a Muslim country someday. Please read some related answers:  What are the major stereotypes people have about Kazakhstan and to what extent are they true? Would Uyghurs / Kazakhs / Turkmens / support Tayyip Erdogan if they lived in Turkey? And do they hate Alevis / the Shia? In Kazakhstan, how does religion influence politics? Could someone provide with a religion timeline of what is now Russia/Kazakhstan before the spread of Christianity? I hope those questions\\answers will convince anyone that Kazakhstan is not a Muslim country, Kazakhs may say that they are Muslims, when they don't obey that religion, they may not even know much about Islam. Same for Russians in Kazakhstan, they will say that they are Orthodox, but most of them never have been to Church and don't even celebrate their Orthodox Christmas. Kazakhstan is not religious at all. So, anyone who calls Kazakhs mainly Muslim is clearly not qualified to write articles about Kazakhstan and doesn't understand much about it either. Demographically, the region therefore has much in common with Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and the eastern Donbass region, whose majority Russian-speaking populations pulled out of Kiev's orbit with help from Moscow. There is no separatist rebellion in northern Kazakhstan, but the ethnic Russians, who make up more than a fifth of the country's 18 million population, are feeling increasingly insecure and some sympathize with the separatists in Ukraine. Yeah, clearly some sympathize with the separatists in Ukraine, I would even say that most are, at least persons in their 30-40s or senior citizens, but some Kazakhs do sympathize to or they are neutral. Kazakhstan is very different from Ukraine, you cannot pull of some silly revolutons in Kazakhstan(I hope so), the driving force of the revolutions the youth in Kazakhstan will not come on street during New Years and stay on some square(like Ukrainians did), you will go and celebrate new Year with your friends and family. Most importantly, the Russian youth from Kazakhstan tends to actually study in Russia and therefore they just change their citizenship afterwards if they want to live in Russia. Why would you want to make your hometown part of Russia, if you are not going to stay their? There is no actual border between Kazakhstan and Russia, no one would check your luggage or search you, you don't need any visas, you just need a passport to show on the border. So, it's no problem to visit Kazakhstan for Russians, and to visit Russia or Kazakhstani people. Also, Kazakhstan, unlike Ukraine actually grew economically during the last 20 years, so the quality of life is improving, people don't have a solid reason to rebel against anything. Also, we don't have medias controlled by oligarchy like Ukraine does. Actually media in Kazakhstan are somewhat irrelevant, I don't know if anyone actually uses them instead of internet. As of right now I don't see any reason for rebellions, revolutions in Kazakhstan.  Some locals working across the border acquire a second, Russian citizenship, which is illegal but possible due to lack of coordination between Russian and Kazakh authorities.  It is illegal and it is also stupid. You don't need Kazakhstan citizenship if you work in Russia, like I already have written above, there is no real restriction for you to freely visit Kazakhstan with Russian citizenship. Also, it is not a real necessity to get Russian citizenship, but most people who work\\study in Russia want to get it, but there is not much benefits from it.  In 2014, Kazakhstan's foreign ministry officially protested over comments by deputy Russian parliament speaker Vladimir Zhirinovsky who said Kazakhstan had been given Russian lands during the Soviet era.  To make it clear, Vladimir Zhirinovsky has a little power in Russia, he has a minor party and he always says stuff like that to appeal to his voters. I bet he would sat that Russia should build a wall and threw every migrant outside that wall. In the same year, Russian President Vladimir Putin praised Nazarbayev for establishing modern Kazakhstan, adding that Kazakhs had never had a state before. Although it never rebuked Putin directly, shortly afterwards Kazakhstan announced it would celebrate the 550th anniversary of the Kazakh Khanate in 2015. Wow, Vladimir Putin doesn't know history of Kazakhstan, I don't think anyone abroad does. It is a shame that people who prepare Putin for speeches and Putin himself didn't know anything about Kazakhstan's history, but it's understandable. Also, I think any educated person in Kazakhstan would know about Kazakh Khanate. (Editing by Christian Lowe and Giles Elgood) I hope they will not write anything about Kazakhstan again. This article is half-fiction. ",

There were sad but true incidents. May there be peace and reconciliation in Kazakhstan. It's interesting why there weren't anti-Russian clashes. My simple guess: it's because in the regions where Russians are the majority (Northern, Eastern Kazakhstan) Kazakhs got used to and developed healthy relationships and ethnically mixed families and children are not rare. And the National Security (\u04b0\u049a\u041a) prevents all even smallest anti-Russian activities. In my opinion it is important to know the history and try to prevent such conflicts in the future.
