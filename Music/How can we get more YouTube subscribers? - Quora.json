            "answer_text": "Marques Brownlee (MKBHD! One of the most popular tech YouTuber) had only 78 subscribers after posting 100 videos. Today he has over 5M subscribers on YouTube. Some might get success in few month for some, it may take years. Just never give up. You can break this guide up into 3 segments, 0-1,000 subscribers, 1,000-10,000, and 10,000+ subscribers a selfsustainable stage.  One thing that should be noted, is that luck IS a factor on Youtube, no matter what anyone says. For fast growth you need good original content which is widely appealing, however for the fastest growth you also need luck. Here you can read How to Make A Successful YouTube Channel 0 \u2013 1,000 Subscribers YouTube algorithms tend to result in a snowball effect for most channels; as soon as they see your videos are getting some attention, they will show them more often in their search results and similar videos, resulting in even more views and so on. That being said, the first thousand subscribers are most likely not going to be organic and you will need to seek out people in a similar way to what you would do for any blog or website. Search videos that your target audience are watching, and comment on those videos but don\u2019t spam. In addition, seek out communities on sites such as Reddit and Facebook, and start participating. Once again don\u2019t spam, aim on providing value. In addition to getting people to check out your content where you think it could provide extra value, you will learn more about your target audience.While doing all of this, make at least 1 video that you think is sure to trigger people once they find your channel. The reason for this is you need a convincing video as your featured video in order to trigger people to subscribe. 1,000 \u2013 10,000 Subscribers Now you\u2019ve attained a solid base of subscribers and videos, it\u2019s time to explore the options that become available because of it. The first interesting approach is to collaborate with other YouTubers. While having less than 1,000 subscribers might not give bigger YouTubers incentive to work with you, now that you have a decent audience people see the value in working together with you. Seek out YouTubers with a similar target audience and with a subscriber base of around 1k to 10k and connect with them, asking if they would want to collaborate some time. Now you might think the only way to reach the audience of your partner is by having a video on his or her channel, but having a video on your channel often results in them mentioning it and redirecting viewers, which results in more people checking out your channel. Another form of collaboration is featuring similar channels in the featured channel tab. This is nice as it will always pop up whenever someone views that particular channel, and it doesn\u2019t require a big time investment.Secondly, now you have more views coming in and more videos lined up, it\u2019s important to create a good environment for those who watch videos. That\u2019s where playlists come into play as they will get your audience to watch more videos similar the ones they are watching and help you maintain a structured channel that is easy to navigate. The earlier you start using playlists, the better. 10,000+ Subscribers Once you get to 10,000 subscribers you will maintain a steady subscriber growth on a daily basis as you continue to put out regular content like you\u2019ve been doing. At this point, you have a pretty good idea about your target audience and the optimal process of your channel. There\u2019s a lot of steps you can still take to stimulate the growth and quality even more, but here are some steps that are specific to channels that are in the 10,000 \u2013 30,000 range (I\u2019m assuming you don\u2019t need help once you get to 30k+). Apart from creating a community on social platforms such as Facebook and Twitter which I won\u2019t go into for the sake of staying on track, it\u2019s important to have a structured continuous improvement process. The good thing of having a significant amount of subscribers and views on a daily basis is that you will have a solid foundation for the extensive analytic platform which YouTube offers. What I usually do is go over statistics and optimize videos in which ever way possible. This can be improvements in terms publishing days or times, choosing popular subjects, different annotations, playlists and so on. The statistics YouTube provide are very detailed and useful for any sort of analysis. Here you can read more detailed (4k+ words) post on How To Get Subscribers On YouTube ",

            "answer_text": "In 2017, I committed to doing more video. Our Growth Everywhere channel has been getting bigger. We\u2019ve started doing these Facebook Lives on a daily basis, so that\u2019s basically one video every single day to Facebook and YouTube as well. We have one new episode of Marketing School going live every single day to the YouTube channel and then also one Growth Everywhere episode. Things are starting to pile up. We\u2019re getting more views all of a sudden and our subscriber base is growing. We\u2019re adding 20-25 subscribers every day. And that\u2019s just the beginning, because a lot of stuff that we\u2019re publishing is being auto-published and we\u2019re not optimized for TADs or for titles either. We can do a better job. Here are my top 5 tips for growing your Youtube channel: 1. Think in terms of playlists. You should be doing playlists every week because playlists can increase watch time and watch time is one of the primary metrics for growing your YouTube subscriber list. More watch time means they\u2019re going to be serving more ads in general, which means they make more money. 2. Make sure that you have the right tagging in place. You can use a tool like TubeBuddy to make sure that you have the right tags, and you can see how you\u2019re ranking for each tag (these are the things that people are searching for). If you want to rank for content marketing, for example, that might be one of the tags you use and it\u2019s going to show you how well you\u2019re doing. 3. Pay attention to is the thumbnail. You can use a tool like Canva to make sure that you have a good thumbnail because people click on good thumbnails (this is true for Facebook and YouTube). 4. Titles are really, really important. If you don\u2019t know how to write good titles, just Google Copyblogger\u2019s How to Write Magnetic Headlines post. Getting a good number of clicks has everything to do with your thumbnail and your title. If you can\u2019t entice people to actually click, you\u2019re not doing your job as a marketer or a creator. 5. Be consistent. I mentioned the fact that we\u2019re doing one new video almost every single day and one new podcast episode every day plus one longer interview podcast every week. We\u2019re aiming for this kind of obsessive consistency because we know it will pay off\u2014more and more people are going to talk about what we\u2019re doing. What I really like looking at, especially when you\u2019re first starting out, are the people who are Tweeting at you or emailing you to say how helpful your content is. As long as people are saying that your content is really good and it\u2019s helped them a lot, just keep going. Stay consistent. After the first year of Growth Everywhere I was only getting nine downloads per day. After the second year, I was getting maybe 50 downloads per day. After the third year, it went as high as 15,000 downloads in one day. It just takes a lot of time to get this machine going, but it\u2019s absolutely worth it. When I watched the Patriots come back to win when they were down 28 to 3, I kept thinking that this type of comeback is only possible with consistency. You\u2019ve got to stay persistent to make it happen. ",

            "answer_text": "Now a lot of people, when they start their YouTube channel, they find it to be difficult to get started. And why is it so hard? For one reason: YouTube doesn\u2019t appreciate new YouTube channels. Basically, YouTube doesn\u2019t rank your channel until you have about a thousand subscribers. Now as you continue creating videos, you\u2019re going to find that typically channels follow what\u2019s called an S-curve. It starts out very, very slow, and then before you know it, it starts to kick up quickly. This is usually because one of your videos starts to go viral and then that feeds more views to the rest of your channel. So it\u2019s almost like this exponential curve. Then finally, it starts to taper off a little bit, once you hit the peak of your market. Of course, depending on how big your market is, and your audience is, that could keep going up into the millions. Now remember when my first video when viral on my Sexy Confidence channel, that\u2019s basically what kick-started my channel, and that\u2019s what\u2019s gotten me to the 37 million or so views I have on that channel. So here\u2019s how to get to that first hundred subscribers. #1: Create a channel theme that would attract at least 100 subscribers #2: Create a release schedule and talk about it in your weekly YouTube videos #3: Specifically ask your viewers to subscribe and be part of the \u201cFounders Club\u201d #4 Monitor your YouTube analytics to see which videos will get you your first 100 subscribers #5: Make sure you add a YouTube Auto Subscribe Link in the description of your video If you\u2019re ready to start building a new YouTube channel and get your first 100 subscribers, then the most important thing you need to do is produce content that people would WANT to subscribe to. Create the content and follow these fives steps, and before you know it, you could have tens of thousands of subscribers following you and your videos. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s frustrating. When people don\u2019t know how to grow their subscriber base in Youtube, they feel stuck, all the random things they could try to fix their problem seem endless, and they feel alone and overwhelmed\u2026 It\u2019s normal, it is human, and we all have to start small before we grow. So, here are 5 Great Tactics to Grow Your Youtube Channel in 2020+: 1. You have to snap people\u2019s attention as soon as they click to view your video.  When people are on Youtube, they are skimming the channels, just like when you are at home, watching TV, and frenetically changing channels, giving each just 3 seconds to convince you to stay. Some people call this a \u201cpattern interrupt,\u201d I call this: the most important part \u2014 You have to snap people out of the haze of going from video to video, and to snap their attention so they give you a chance. One of the best ways I have found to do this is to clap loudly as soon as your video begins. That\u2019s one of the best ways to wake people up and get their attention. 2. Ask people to subscribe in the first 30 seconds and last 30 seconds of your Youtube video.  In communication, people mostly remember the beginning and end of any video. What is in the middle will be a hazy memory within minutes. So you have to open strong, and end strong. And how to open strong and end strong if your goal is to increase your subscriber base? Simple: Ask them in a positive, value-adding way to subscribe now at the beginning, and remind them \u201cDon\u2019t forget to subscribe now\u201d at the end. Because people are less likely to do what you want if they don\u2019t know you want it. So make it clear, ask them to subscribe twice. 3. Tag Influencers.  When you begin your Youtube journey (or even if it had been going on for a while, but your channel is still small), your best option is to get the attention of an influencer, so they notice your videos, and recommend your channel. And one of the best ways to do this is to tag them on your very best videos, your very best content. When you tag them there, they get notified in a way that stands out: You\u2019re not one of the 1000s of the messages they receive, you are another fellow content creator tagging them to get their opinion and participation in your topic or video content. It may not work every time, but when it works, you\u2019ll see a huge influx of subscribers that will put a smile on your face. 4. Humanize yourself.  Youtube is a community. It\u2019s not a library. If people just want dry knowledge, they\u2019d open a scientific book or university textbook. But people on Youtube want to listen to the opinions, hear the perspectives, and see the content of other fellow human beings (It\u2019s somewhat what I specialize in, at StoryBonding). So, you have to be a human first, and a source for content and entertainment second. A few quick wins to get you started, is to make sure you do at least one small thing every video to come across as a real person: You can show your dog, play with your cat, talk about your kids, share a hobby you\u2019re passionate about, talk about your favorite music, or your devastation because your favorite team lost last week or your beloved celebrity broke up with the love of her life\u2026 There are many ways to do this, but thats\u2019 a simple way. Don\u2019t neglect this, because people Subscribe first and foremost because they like you and trust you. And people can\u2019t like a moving image on a video screen, you have to be a person. 5. Create videos on topics that are already popular. When you\u2019re starting, you don\u2019t know what videos people want to want. You don\u2019t know what topics they are interested in. So, you often will make videos on what you like. That can work in some cases, but often enough, it doesn\u2019t. Why? Because people are interested in what THEY want, not what is interesting to YOU. You are there to serve. There is an exception to this, a big one. But if your goal is to get a lot of subscribers, then you can safely ignore that exception and focus on what people want. Step 1 \u2014 Choose a topic you want to write a video about.Step 2\u2014 Search Youtube to see whether videos on the same topic get a lot of views.Step 3 \u2014 If there are videos with a lot of view on that topic, then you continue and create the video. If not, go back to Step 1. That\u2019s it. Simple and clear. Because sadly the biggest thing that causes people to feel overwhelmed and to not do what is needed is the lack of clarity: too many contradictory views, too much information, plans with a thousand and one steps. Use this plan. It\u2019s effective. It works. Do it. And when you\u2019re done, do it again. Then do it some more. Then, you will see the subscriber growth you\u2019re looking for. \u2014 Did You Like This Answer? Click Here To Find Even Better Content In My Quora Profile. ",

            "answer_text": "From first click to last, I\u2019m going to look at a complete YouTube subscriber strategy that uses our services to push you higher. Make no mistake, you still have to put in some work and create great content, but putting us to work for you will also truly help you reach your YouTube marketing goals faster. Let\u2019s not waste any more time, let\u2019s get your YouTube channel growing so you can be famous already!  UPLOAD YOUR FIRST VIDEOS AND ESTABLISH A BASE OF CONTENT We can\u2019t do anything until you upload your first videos. Yes, I know that\u2019s the hard part! Your content has to be up, and it has to be good, before anything can happen. Try a few videos out. See what type of content works for you. Most importantly, choose a genre, or topic, or style of video that you can keep uploading, often, for a very long time. Here are two early videos from two of YouTube\u2019s most famous users: Philip DeFranco (sXePhil back then) and Jenna Marbles:   Were either of those videos perfectly polished? Nope. Did they spend hours deliberating on every aspect of them? Nope. Did they have high production values like their current videos? Nooooooooooope. The key lesson here is that they knew what they were good at, and they got the content out there to see what people responded to. The Philip DeFranco show is now entering its 10th year, with Phil still doing his \u2018talking to the camera\u2019 bit, and Jenna is still being funny in her way. HAVE A GREAT VIDEO OUTRO This is a more advanced tactic, and I debated putting it closer to the bottom of this list, but it can\u2019t wait. Having a great video outro is one of the biggest things you can do to get views, and drive for more subscribers. Every good video outro has these three aspects: \u2981\tA call to action to subscribe with a YouTube Annotation popping up which allows people to subscribe with one click right there while your video is still playing. \u2981\tAt least one more video of yours to click on so that people can watch more of your content before they click away. The more content of yours they watch, the better the chance they\u2019ll subscribe. \u2981\tLinks, or URLS, or usernames for you on social media. Don\u2019t write off social media as your friends and followers there are subscribed to you via that channel. To see this all happening at once, here\u2019s a great example from one of my favorite (or should I write it \u2018favorite\u2019 for these Canucks) YouTube channels, Epic Meal Time:  To break down what you\u2019re seeing here: \u2981\tUpper left corner: A link to last week\u2019s episode of Epic Meal Time. \u2981\tBottom left corner: A link to a video of their other major cooking show, Handle It. \u2981\tUpper right corner: Links to subscribe to Epic Meal Time and Handle it, as well as their Original Gamer and Harley Blog\u2019s channels. \u2981\tBottom right corner: Links out to their online store for all things Epic Meal. All they\u2019re missing is their social media channels. If you watch the video though you\u2019ll see that they include those a bit earlier on. Considering how busy this screen is, I don\u2019t blame them. PURCHASE VIEWS FOR YOUR CONTENT Ok, you did the hardest part which was to create some content. Now that content needs to look good to all the new people who will be finding your videos. The quickest way to do that is buy views. My suggestion is to buy views from Boost Socials  Why is this important? Because of social proof. You can read a lot more about social proof in this lengthy article of ours, but I\u2019ll sum it up for you quickly: Social proof is a psychological concept which looks at how people react to large crowds. When someone sees a large crowd doing something they are more prone to think that what the crowd is doing is the correct way to behave in the situation. On YouTube, that large crowd is represented by the number of views the video has. Take this YouTube search as an example:  Now, you\u2019re a busy person. Which funny cat video are you more likely to watch with your limited cat video watching time? The one with 100,000,000 views, or the one with 100,000 views? Social proof has shown time and again that the video with many more views is going to be clicked on more often. When you\u2019re a new channel, with very few views, you struggle for longer, perhaps for years, until your social proof catches up with your talent. Buying views is your way to fast track your success. PUSH YOUR YOUTUBE SUBSCRIBERS STRATEGY INTO HIGH GEAR Don\u2019t wait long on doing this step after the one above. Now that people are seeing a few individual videos as worth their time, they\u2019re going to start seeing you as worth their time. And when they see you as worth their time they start thinking about becoming your subscriber. This is right when you need to already have a solid number of subscribers. Boost Socials YouTube Subscribers Tool is just what you need. Social proof applies just as readily to subscribers as it does to views, and you need to get a little bit ahead of the game or you\u2019ll always be getting subscribers below your talent level.  Which of these two channels is going to get your click? The one with 148,000 subscribers, or the one with 141? We both know the answer to that, and this is why you need to boost your subscriber numbers now. Using social media as part of your YouTube subscriber strategy Yes, we all know about social media and how it can spread pretty much anything. Your YouTube videos will, or course, be shared on social media often. First by you, then by your fans. But since we already took the steps above to push your views and subscribers higher, why not use that social proof on social media? Here are some examples pulled from Twitter:   All of these channels have had varying degrees of success with their YouTube subscriber strategy, but they have all realized one thing: Talking about how their videos or channel is successful helps build their social proof. Their followers know they\u2019re gaining popularity thanks to these tweets, and these followers will pay more attention to these channels now. While we\u2019re on the subject of social media, be sure to use good calls to action here. Pushing people to subscribe to you by simply telling them \u2018Please subscribe to my channel\u2019, especially while sending out a message about your success, will push more people to finally click subscribe. Calls to action need to be a big part of your YouTube subscriber strategy! USING SOCIAL PROOF ON YOUR YOUTUBE CHANNEL Just as you\u2019re going to use your newfound social proof on social media, you\u2019re going to use it on your YouTube channel as well. This will be in the form of \u2018thank you\u2019 videos which you create for your subscribers. They can range from simple videos like Markiplier, or complex best of/throwback type content like Rhett and Link:   Either way, this is straight-up a social proof video that\u2019s easy for your fans to share. Who doesn\u2019t like to share a video which is, essentially, saying \u2018look at this popular thing I\u2019m part of! Don\u2019t you want to be part of it too?\u2019 Understanding this point, and using it over and over again as so many successful YouTubers have before you, is the last YouTube subscriber strategy you need to know about. YouTube is not the type of platform which has one goal that you reach and then relax. It is constant, it never stops, as you always need more subscribers. Now get ready to create many videos thanking your fans, because you\u2019re well on your way to being famous on YouTube if you keep following these tips! ",

            "answer_text": "Gaining more subscribers can seem like a difficult task, but I\u2019ll share 10 tips to help you get your first 1000 subscribers. 1. Post Useful Content Consistently This is one of the most difficult things to do as a content creator. If you take a look around YouTube you might think that every video under the sun has been created and that is most likely right, but you can put your own spin on a popular topic. For example, there are many \u201cunboxing\u201d tech videos\u2026what if you created a \u201creboxing\u201d and talk about the various components of tech while you put it back in the box? The key here is creativity and that will certainly boost subscriptions. 2. Title of Your Videos Strategically One of the most difficult things is to name your video. You have the name in your head, but it may be something complex or too long. My rule is to keep it basic and use the YouTube autocomplete to name the video. There is nothing wrong with your video having the same name or something close to a popular video, as long as it\u2019s relevant. 3. Spruce Up Your Channel Design Most visitors first impression of you is from your channel and your design. This is where visitors interact and get to know what you are about. Create a engaging header and indicate your brand. On my channel, we were intentional about our design making it fit into our overall branding strategy. The key takeaway is to design with purpose. 4. Show Your Lighter Side Lighten up and laugh at yourself. Bloopers make you more human and show something different than an ordinary talking head video. Also, switch up the video and catch your viewers off guard so they don\u2019t know what to expect. 5. Achieve Real Views and Subscribers You can get a lot of views and subcribers this way , they\u2019re real subscribers but they won\u2019t always be worthwhile views . If you\u2019re going to purchase views , make sure you\u2019re actually getting real views , and that the views actually lasts . YouTube will filter out fraudulent views, subscribers and drop them , decreasing your watch time by however long the view was , and can even penalize your channel if they think you\u2019re buying bad views . I think you need help from THIS ONE. It provides a large amount of views and real active, non-drop subscribers for your channels I have used it, the result is very amazing. So, it\u2019s always my first choice to recommend to everyone. 6. Create A Custom Thumbnail I have seen my subscriptions and views increase by adding this step. I use impact font that is seen on many internet photos to grab attention and I format the photo using Adobe Photoshop. I usually title the photo thumbnail differently than the video because when people are scrolling through other videos to view, they can easily tell what my video is about. 7. Use Annotations Annotations are those annoying things that pop up during videos, but they can be a content creator\u2019s dream. I add annotations to every video and make it easy by creating a link for them to subscribe. This is extra work, but once you see your subscription rate increase you will continue to add them to every video. 8. Invite Subscribers This is really basic. At the end of every video ask viewers to \u201clike\u201d and subscribe to your channel. You should also tell them why they should subscribe, for example if you are a DIY Home Improvement channel I would say, \u201csubscribe for my DIY projects, tricks and insider tips delivered to you weekly.\u201d Remember, be careful what you ask for, because you might get it. 9. Be Yourself You are the best you\u2014you can be. Being on camera was difficult for me at first because I compared myself to others who are natural on camera talent then I realized, \u201cI just have to be me.\u201d Let your personality shine in your videos and I guarantee someone will connect with you. 10. Create An Engaging Channel Trailer With the new channel design, YouTube gives content creators a great opportunity to create a trailer to share what your content is about. Have you ever watched a movie without viewing a trailer? Not me, because you want to see what it is about. Keep your trailer under 90 seconds and show scenes from your other videos and provide a strong call to action of why a viewer should become a subscriber. ",

            "answer_text": "I like to think of this as a general two-step process Step 1: Make your channel great Before you focus on truly gaining a lot of subscribers, you have to make your channel one that people would want to subscribe to. This sounds simple, but is something that is often overlooked, as YouTubers rush to promote their channel before fully developing it. Think of it this way - If you advertise your channel on a large scale, but there are only a few videos, all of the people who find it will not have much to explore. Many will not be interested in the small amount of content there is, and will simply click off and forget about the channel. Your goal should be to get to the point where, if someone were to find your channel, they would immediately subscribe because of the abundance of interesting content. Make your first priority the production of good videos, and save the marketing for the next step Step 2: Promotion Okay, now that you\u2019ve developed your channel into something interesting, you have to bring people to it. To do this, simply think of the most common ways that people discover new videos or channels. Recommended videos/Search results - This is not really in your control, unless you pay for advertisements to put your video at the top of search results. This is something that will come after you get a lot of views. Word-of-Mouth - Telling friends/family about your channel can help, but it will really only take you so far. Do not rely on this as a method of truly growing your channel on a large scale. Comment sections - This is often overlooked. Oftentimes if people see a funny or interesting comment in the comment section they will click on the channel who posted the comment (I have done this many times). To do this effectively, name your channel something relevant to the topic of videos you make, and comment on videos that are of the same topic. For example, if I make videos about investing, I can add \u201cInvestments\u201d or \u201cInvestor\u201d somewhere in my channel name. If I go comment on other videos related to investing, many of the viewers will see my channel name and possibly check it out (remember, if people are watching a video of the same topic, they are likely interested in that topic).

            "answer_text": "This is a question that all aspiring Youtubers ask themselves at some point. It can leave you frustrated knowing despite the long hours you put your channel is stagnant. The answer to the question is not as simple as you do this you get subscribers. As a YouTuber myself, I made plenty of blunders before I understood what works and what does not. Here I am sharing the tips that helped me build my channel from the 0 subscribers to my current position. 1. Select A Theme: YouTube Channels posting a variety of unrelated content, go into oblivion. A classic example of, Jack of all trades but a master of none.That\u2019s why, if you are new to YouTube \u2013 before doing anything, decide upon a theme. A niche which you are well aware of and comfortable with. Example: Engineering Classes, Movie Reviews, Sports Analysis, Vines, etc.2. Clear up the clutter If you already have a YouTube Channel and posted a few videos in it, this tip is for you. As you have narrow-downed your theme, it\u2019s crucial to remove old content which isn\u2019t related. Furthermore, remove poorly produced content or flop videos which should never have made it, in the first place. These videos make the audience lose trust in your brand. It is important to look consistent.3. Do your Back Ground Research I too, have been guilty of this mistake. Once I realised its importance, I used it to my advantage to understand m audience and what content works. Stalk your direct competitors and other popular channels, note down the topics they make videos about. Further, notice the reaction of their audience to it. This gives a wholesome idea about what topics generate interest; to make videos on. 4. Scripting You might think you can be Pewdipie and wing it on screen. But you shouldn\u2019t. A solid script guides you to organise your videos help you to uphold quality throughout your video. Include as many details as possible in your script: The main points that need to be deliveredThe exact words you need to use, in different situationsAll the actions you need to use, in different situationsVarious Images or Statistics that might be requiredVarious Call-of-Action (subscribe to the channel, click on the link, etc.)4. Ideal Mix of contents You may think every video you make will go viral and be a trendsetter. This may happen, but this is not a smart strategy if you want to grow your channel consistently.Use the 80-20 rule.It\u2019s wise to have 80% of your content Search Engine Optimised (SEO), (i.e.) Topical or Evergreen content. Basically, make content on what is trending and what the users are looking forFor the remaining 20%, you can make content \u2013 that you are genuinely passionate about, which no one else has thought about yet. Content which follows no patterns, just love.This will help you retain your identity and still grow your subscriber base. 5. Have a Hook Start like Sachin Tendulkar and Finish like Dhoni. 30% drop off in the first 30 seconds of the video and 50% in the first 30 seconds. You have a 30 sec time to catch the attention. Make a controversial statement, show an interesting part of the video or show the end product to hold the user. Start with Bang and end with a bigger bang. 6. Show personality Nobody wants a lecture or monotonous dialogue. Enough of that happens in school and college. You are not only selling your content also yourself. Be passionate and quirky and most importantly, natural. Take Bhuvan Bham, for example. He grew just because of his out of the box personality. Pattern interrupts are things that break the monotony and refresh the user. They could be a lame joke, funny background picture or filter. 7. Using the end screens: This is the number one tactic to help you keep the users in your channel and increase your session time. You might know many YouTubers who take 10 seconds before the end, to guide you to their next video; isn\u2019t it? This exactly is the End Screen. Whether you want to get YouTube Subscribers, point to your previous videos, promote your website or crowdfund a campaign; you can do it all here. 8. Tantalizing thumbnails Thumbnails are you first and best impression on the user. You need to stand out and attract the user. Use the colours Blue, Orange, Green and yellow as these work the best according to a study by Baklinko. 9. Intriguing Headline This has two benefits. It attracts users and also used to rank on Youtube. Your title must have your primary keyword and 1 or 2 power word and at least one emotional word. For example, let us say your headline is \u201c Best tips for the most effective Youtube strategy for young influencers\u201d. The keyword is Youtube strategy, and your power words are Best and effective, and the emotional word is young. 10. Using Contests and Going Live Going live helps you interact with your audience and adds to your accessibility. Contests will help you drive user engagement. These are some of the basic and most important mantras to remember. They will help in your consistent growth. Feel free to ask me any queries or tips you would like to know in the comments section.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve read a few of the answers for this question and they have a lot of good information on what you should do to get more subscribers, however, they are missing the point. By having a YouTube channel you are a digital performer and that means you need to do marketing. You need to think of yourself as a business. If this was a easy as just following a list of instructions then every business would easily become successful in the world but they don\u2019t. In fact most fail. They try to hack the system and copy everything and they just don\u2019t succeed. You need to ask yourself why you subscribe? Why do you click that shiny red button? Why do you want to know when a new video comes in? Why did you pick this specific person to be the one that you get information/entertainment from in that genre? This is what you need to be asking yourself. You need three things to succeed in marketing which will lead to more subscribers. Offer real valueTell the people that would be interested in that value(for YouTube) - People need to care about youThat is it. Simple to understand and difficult to execute. At the core of every success business this is what they are doing, even if it happened by accident. Offering real value may sound obvious and what you think you are doing, but are you really? Are you creating content that other people aren\u2019t doing? Other people may make gaming videos but do your ones feel different because of something that you do. Is your content worth the time the view spends on it or do you need to give more in less time? Point 2 is where you can start using all of those lists mentioned in the other posts because you need to get your content out there for your audience to find. The question you need to answer is who is your audience. Lots of people just create content and through it out there hoping it will stick. You need to take your quality and give it to people who want it. For instance if you are doing photography tutorials you need to find out where your audience is hanging out and that would be on all of the different websites they frequent. If you get your tutorial shared there then you will attract some of their audience while also giving them a great post. This is exactly what Peter McKinnon did and it jump started his channel. Point 3 is not always important in business. You can sell cheap stuff no one cares about and make a fortune. However, to succeed on YouTube you need to think like Apple. You need people to care about you. This is why immediately going to vlogging doesn\u2019t work because no one cares about you yet. I can get news from many YouTubers but I enjoy how Philip DeFranco does it so I\u2019m invested in his channel. You need people to want to spend time with you. This is the difference between a view and a subscriber. When someone subscribes they are saying that want to spend more time with you. I recommend re-watching your videos with friends and asking everyone if this person is someone people want to be friends with. They need to be honest because YouTube you isn\u2019t the same as normal you. There is no answer to question. The only solution is for you to think about these questions, answer them, and then act. I completely believe that if you are making quality videos that appeal to a group and you make sure that group knows about them then you will create subscribers. Create. Learn. Improve. Repeat. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Getting more free YouTube subscribers is the best way to maximize your organic reach on the second-largest website in the world. #1: Clean Up Your YouTube Channel Before we get into the good stuff, it is important to do some housekeeping. While you may think everything your business does is flawless, you are not Beyonc\u00e9, so your audience might not think so... I know, I know, it\u2019s hard to swallow, but it\u2019s important to step away from your self and into the shoes of an outsider from time to time.Taking a hard look at your YouTube channel and re-evaluating what is on there will likely lead to the realization that a chunk of old content should be deleted\u2014whether it is outdated, poorly produced, or just a flop of a video that should have never made it up there in the first place. If you have something of this nature tied to your brand, it\u2019s going to immediately turn that lead off, and cause them to lose trust in your brand. Delete it and never look back! #2: Only Create and Post Highly Watchable Content Yes, I know this tip might seem obvious, but YouTube is full of clutter, so it\u2019s easy to feel like you can get away with posting sub-par content. Well, you can\u2019t! The only way to really stand out from the pack and grow your subscriber base it to create the best of the best content in your space. The key to accomplishing this is planning during pre-production. Here are a few ways you can do this better then your competition: Do Your Research Watch your competitors\u2019 videos, as well as videos in industries outside of yours, and jot down notes of the most intriguing parts. Rather then copying what your competition is doing, find a more creative way to do it better. For example, if I was in the gum business (or any other business for that matter) I\u2019d probably take a tip or two from my all time favorite YouTube commercial, The Story of Sarah and Juan. Check it out, and just try and tell me this didn\u2019t make you cry. #3: Execute Top-Notch Channel Trailers YouTube has this beautiful feature for marketers looking to grow their subscription base, called channel trailers. These are just as they sound, short trailers that automatically play when a visitor arrives on your YouTube channel page. This is the perfect opportunity to build your subscription base, if, and only if, you create insanely compelling content. These trailers need to be short (30-60 seconds), compelling, and most importantly they need to give your visitors a reason to stay. Do they need to be hilarious, beautiful, and emotionally charged? It will definitely help! What I really can\u2019t stress enough is the need for an impactful call-to-action that gives the viewer a reason to subscribe. Check out this awesome example from SoulPancake. Not only is the trailer the perfect length, it provokes motivational emotions, comedy, and ends with a very creative call-to-action. #4: Make Sure Your Videos Are Under 5 Minutes So, your videos are all 30-60 minutes because your digital engineering software is complicated to explain? Or perhaps you\u2019re in the law industry and believe the only way to instill trust is to include long video testimonials on your channel? While testimonials are great, long videos and YouTube do not go well together! Regardless of how complicated the product you\u2019re marketing is, your videos should never exceed 5 minutes. Why? Well, science. Study after study proves that online video viewers have a short attention span. I mean, did you forget earlier when I told you how 20 percent of viewers drop off within the first 10 seconds? In fact, HubSpot has found that the ideal length for videos on YouTube is a nice and concise 2 minutes. So re-edit those long webinars, and turn them into short, snappy clips. #5: Turn a Set of Videos into a Binge-Worthy Playlist Do you have a set of videos that go together? Perhaps you do a recurring weekly educational series, or you have a set of webinars around the same theme? Whatever it is, you should make that grouping into a YouTube playlist. This will allow your viewers to continue watching without having to manually search for and click into the next video. Why is this good for subscription growth? Well, it will keep people on your channel longer, and show them that you have a plethora of quality content. This will also keep your video content highly organized so your channel doesn\u2019t become a cluttered mess that turns users away. BuzzFeed Tasty does an awesome job at this. Check out their YouTube playlist page, which is grouped by different categories like, \u201cDinner,\u201d \u201cVegetarian,\u201d and my personal favorite because I despise dishes, \u201cOne-Pot Recipes.\u201d  ",

            "answer_text": "How to get free YouTube subscribers: 5 tips . Ask your viewers to subscribe I told you we\u2019re starting with the easiest ones first. Sometimes your audience just needs to be reminded. The big red subscribe button is omnipresent, but you might also want to point out the bell beside it that turns on notifications for your new videos. Simple. Does this tip seem too salesy to you? This is your reminder that you\u2019ve got valuable content, and you\u2019re just making it easier for them to keep up with the work you do. If you\u2019re already doing this, remember to demonstrate why your channel is worth subscribing to. And make sure you do it right when they love you the most (e.g., right after you\u2019ve provided new and useful information, or you\u2019ve made them laugh). Don\u2019t do it too much, or you\u2019ll risk turning people off. 2. End your videos by mentioning the one you\u2019re working on next Subscribing to a YouTube channel is an act of anticipation. Viewers who\u2019ve just seen what your brand is about are primed to want more, if you\u2019ve done your job right. Hyping your next video, and making it clear why it\u2019s not to be missed, is the most organic way to encourage people to tap subscribe. Of course, this requires having a good handle on your content schedule, and knowing what\u2019s coming next. (More on that soon.) 3. Interact with your audience and make friends If you form relationships with your viewers, they\u2019re more likely to want to keep watching your work. Respond to comments. Follow their channels back. Yes, it\u2019s exciting if a famous YouTuber comments on your video, but who knows who\u2019ll be famous next year. Form a community of peers and promote each other. (Yes, I\u2019m talking about shine theory. Also, once you\u2019re plugged in, your audience will provide you with plenty of free content ideas for your next video. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to take all of them. Manage your YouTube presence using Hootsuite and not only can you upload and schedule videos, you can also add comment streams to your dashboard. That makes it easy to review, reply, and/or moderate comments on all your videos from one place. 4. Brand your thumbnails A thumbnail is a 1280 x 720px still image that acts as a cover for your video. And they are also your first, best chance to persuade people to click on your video. (Aside from your video titles, that is, but more on that later.) While some might advocate using the most \u201ceye-catching\u201d design (which seems to mean screaming red capslock over a man\u2019s shocked face and a picture of a\u2026 tomato?), one size does not fit all on YouTube. But we aren\u2019t here to earn cold views. To convert a viewer into a subscriber, take a look at your videos page. What does a new viewer see? Sleek, professional and consistent videos that imply an ongoing commitment to quality? Or a random mish-mash competing for attention? You want to aim for consistent branding in all your thumbnails. Use the same font, the same colour palette, or even the same frame composition so people know (at least subconsciously) that they\u2019re looking at a video from your channel. For instance, John Plant has built his survivalist Primitive Technology channel up to 9.9 million subscribers with understated, minimalist thumbnails. They\u2019re not loud, but they are consistent. And most importantly, they\u2019re clickable. 11. Release videos on a consistent schedule Many experts confidently cite a rule-of-thumb as to how often creators should post video to their channels. For instance: one video a week to start, increasing to 3-4 week as your channel grows. The theory is that more videos = more watch time from viewers. But prioritizing quantity over quality has drawbacks. If your goal is to convert viewers to subscribers, you need to focus on quality first, and consistency next. (Then you can start worrying about quantity.) If you upload videos consistently, then people know that more good content is coming, and they\u2019re more likely to tap subscribe. You can also use a social media management platform like Hootsuite to schedule your videos on YouTube for publishing later. Aditya \ud83d\ude00 ",

The following article will reveal six simple\u2014yet highly effective\u2014methods for getting more subscribers to your channel and your existing videos.

In short, your videos need to be remarkable. The biggest sin in marketing is to be boring. How can your videos be the opposite of boring? #2: Use Annotations Annotations are the little colorful sticky notes that people paste all over their videos once they\u2019ve been uploaded to YouTube. Although this tool is often overused, a few strategically placed annotations can make a world of difference for your YouTube marketing efforts. Call-to-action annotation: Add a \u201cspeech bubble\u201c annotation directly under the Subscribe button to all of your old and existing videos. Click-to-action annotation: When you mention your call to action, add an image, graphic or \u201cbutton\u201c to the video and overlay it with a \u201cSpotlight\u201c annotation that links directly to your channel subscribe page. In short, your viewers can now subscribe by clicking an annotation inside your video. #3: Add a YouTube Widget and More to Your Blog If you already have a web property that is getting traffic, this is a great opportunity to leverage those visitors and get them to become subscribers to your channel. And they can do it with the click of a button. Once you start embedding your YouTube videos on your blog, there are two really easy ways to get more subscribers: YouTube Subscription Widget: By installing the YouTube Subscription Widget to the sidebar of your blog or website, you can make it even easier for others to find your videos and subscribe to future content. #4: Leverage Featured Channels Another simple method for increasing your reach and scooping up more subscribers is to strategically partner with other YouTube content-creators. Directly on your YouTube channel page is an option to add other \u201cFeatured Channels\u201d of those \u201cYouTubers\u201d you like and recommend. When you get other channels that have a similar audience to feature you, you can expect to see new viewers coming your way very quickly. #5: Consistently Interact When you start to understand that YouTube is a community, not just a place to host your videos, you will begin to see far more results when you interact with the other members of this community. One of the best ways to build a following of subscribers is to support others in their YouTube marketing efforts. Comment, like and subscribe as frequently as possible to other content-creators on YouTube, and wait for the reciprocation. Take a few minutes a day to find some new and relevant YouTube channels, pay attention to their content and leave real, genuine comments. It\u2019s a simple concept, really: the more you give, the more you get. #6: Create a Payoff Lastly, my favorite strategy for attracting new subscribers starts by creating a \u201cpayoff.\u201d There is something magical about posting your goals to the public. You want to lose a few stubborn pounds? Post it on Facebook! Do you fancy that special someone? Shout it from a rooftop! But what if you want more YouTube subscribers? Here\u2019s a simple step-by-step process of the \u201csubscriber payoff method\u201d in action: Identify your current subscriber count (e.g., 450 subscribers) Identify your subscriber goal (e.g., 500 subscribers) Pick something fun, unique or different that you will do once you reach 500 subscribers (e.g., a free giveaway, shave your head, do a crazy dance on video, etc.) Share your goal (and your payoff) with the world. When you share your goals with the world, people will jump on board to support you and help you accomplish your goals. This is a great way to spread your reach with little effort and have a fun time doing it. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi there, to increase number of subscribers for your Youtube channel , below are some of the easy ways you may try out: \u00b7 Create Engaging Content Channels and videos with higher watch time are more likely to turn up in search results and recommendations. So, you need to keep in mind that you have to value your viewer\u2019s time and deliver value right away while creating your content. FYI, tfirst eight seconds of your video is the most important. The click-away rate in those eight seconds is most. So, make sure that you start delivering information right away and don\u2019t put the important information at the end of the video. \u00b7 Schedule Your Videos The BEST thing you can do with YouTube is to make a lot of content and make it consistently. The frequency helps you retain existing subscribers, also helps you to attract new subscribers to your Youtube channel. The formula which all famous YouTuber follow is the 1*4 formula. Publish four YouTube videos every month. That breaks down into one video every week. It\u2019s an easy number to remember and you\u2019ll soon see the increase in youtube Subscriber. \u00b7 Create attractive Video Thumbnail Create an attractive thumbnail for your videos to increase click-through rate. Use relevant text and image in the thumbnail. A custom video thumbnail with a minor annotation will tell your users what your video is all about. Youtube offers a selection of thumbnails from three intervals of your video. These intervals are at the 1/4th mark, at 1/2 mark, and at the 3/4th mark. Choose the one that best illustrates what your video. \u00b7 Customize your Youtube Channel Craft Youtube Channel to create trust with your brand. Make the most of the YouTube channel bio and custom URL to finish up your channel customizations. Keep the bio short and to the point. You can always link to your website URL in the video description for a more detailed bio. Another important step in customizing your channel is to create an awesome introduction video. YouTube offers a great feature called channel trailers that lets you automatically play a video upon the opening of a YouTube channel. Your channel trailer is the first thing any visitor will see on your Youtube page. So, channel trailer is something you must carefully work on and constantly improve to keep visitors engaged. Try to give a quick, informative, and engaging introduction. \u00b7 Motivate your audience to Subscribe A simple link created for subscribing to the channel can increase youtube subscriber. The pro technique is to add a call to action button. If you\u2019re using a graphic to add a call to action, you can liven it up with a call to action annotation. Make sure to put it subtly it should not annoy your viewers. \u00b7 Interact with your fans Key to make a loyal fan base is to keep interacting with your fans. Interact with your audience, and listen to their requests in the comments section of your videos. Make sure you reply to each comment both negative and positive. It will increase your credibility and increase Youtube subscribers. There are more ways to increase subscribers other than those I\u2019ve mention. You may try and error for better result and if you would like to get a hand from others to increase your Youtube subscribers, I would recommend you AppSally. Hope that was insightful. Wish you best of the luck!  ",

            "answer_text": "As someone who's helped a channel grow from under 4 million subs to over 6.8 million in less than two years, here's what I've learned. Content is king. First and foremost, concentrate on doing something you love, and making your best possible version of whatever that is.Consistency. If you truly love the process of making your content, it will be easier for you to stick with it. It can take a lot of content to both gain, and maintain, people's attention. Whatever you're making, it\u2019s best if you can maintain a specific release schedule - e.g. every Tuesday at 10 - the YouTube algorithm rewards this.Make the ask; make it easy. Though it may seem obvious, don\u2019t assume everyone knows what you want. Ask your viewers to subscribe. You can do this at the beginning, or end, of your videos. Some people do both. Be sincere.End Cards. Utilize the EndCards function, which can make it easier for people to subscribe on mobile devices. It also makes it easier for people to watch the next video, or playlist, you might have queued up for them. It's important to understand the vast majority of viewers in North America, Europe, and Australia are currently watching YouTube on their phones.Engage. Find a way, where possible, to engage with your audience. People feel more connected if it's not entirely a one way street. Some people do this by including something to vote on at the end - a kind of \u201cwhat do you want to see next\u201d ask. Other people get involved in their comments section.Leverage Social Media. If you're not already doing this, social media is another great rescourse to both engage with your audience, promote your content, and ask for thing which may be important for you - likes, shares, and subs. It's also great for building a whole network of colleague, where you may become friends, or even collaborators on some projects.So build your content library, and find your community. A million subscribers won't typically happen overnight, so be patient and learn to enjoy the process. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you Devaraj for requesting this question. As a new YT creator, this question strikes only to those who seeks long term solution. Otherwise, most creators still play the outdated games of \u201cSubscribe for Subscribe\u201d and \u201cview for view\u201d. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not on of them. Now let\u2019s address the real issue here. When somebody creates their new YT channel and publish their first few videos, and those videos receive only a few to no views, they think it\u2019s the YT SEO that they need to focus more on. While it\u2019s true for the most part. But they overlook their content of their videos. To make a video, they\u2019ll collect all the facts out there by watching other videos and may be few blogs and they\u2019ll use it in their video and publish it. It\u2019s a good approach. But what they\u2019ve missed is the connection with their audience. If you can narrate a story, better if from your personal life or from your circle, then you\u2019ll be able to make a connection. Because your story is different in spite of the facts being same. If you keep doing this with future videos, the engagement % will gradually increase. Increase in engagement will bring you real and active users. Tip #1 : Your channel might be a technical channel (for instance) and you talk about features in a DSLR. When making a video about the latest Canon DSLR, talk about why did you love it and your friend didn\u2019t. [It has to be genuine, you can\u2019t just fool your viewers.] People will be able to relate to your video and hit like. Few will leave comments and other few will subscribe. Tip #2 : Join and leverage FB groups related to your niche. Help the community as much as you can with your knowledge, if needed share your video link to them and if your video impresses them, there\u2019s a high chance of getting new subscribers Tip #3 : Add a playlist called \u201cChannel Update\u201d in your channel and talk about why you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing, what new content are you planning, inform them about your milestone, etc. And so many other things can be done. Just remember to \u201cCONNECT\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "For those of you just starting out on YouTube, there's a lot involved. But you really need to hold your horses and remember to stick with the basics. I have a few different categories of videos. Devotionals, Inspirational, Travel vLogs, Fitness How-To, Supplement Reviews, Equipment Reviews, to name a few. All of these are sorted in categories, and arranged on the main page of my channel. I use EYE CATCHING and INFORMATIVE thumbnails. Along with a channel banner, that is attractive, and lets folks know where they are. The banner and logo is throughout ALL of my social media, videos and of course THIS website. Remember this important point. It's all about BRANDING. Note: there is a lot more to branding, this is branding 101 info above. Now back to the videos\u2026 The last 2 categories in the list, my equipment and supplement reviews, are the ones that get the most people watching! How do I know that? By my analytics and view counts. Knowing that important tidbit of data, I will focus on what is getting the most views hoping that I can encourage viewers to watch my Inspirational and Devotionals by having \u201cCARDS\u201d at the end of my video for them to click on and watch. After getting a number of videos produced, the key is to look at your analytics, see WHICH ONES are pulling in the most viewers, and HOLDING them. This tells you what *IS* and *IS NOT* working for you. Trail and error I am afraid! JUST DO IT! vLogging basics Get a digital video camera or use your cellphone to start, that\u2019s how I did it. See my recent equipment blog and video Setup vLog I did.  Then think of what and how you are going to shoot your video. What \"character\" will you be? This is your content. When it comes to YouTube the biggest thing of course is compelling content. Content, Content, Content! It of course starts with working hard, making outstanding content, great editing, compelling visuals, proper tags, descriptions and great thumbnails. HAVE A GREAT TITLE! Do a search on the subject you are doing and see what pops up in the search bar, this will give you some idea of titles to use. Then post on ALL THE SOCIAL media from the SHARE link, TALK to people, get on forums and post links to your channel in the appropriate discussion, find like minded people and network. have business cards with your channel on it. LEAVE THEM every where! You need to make sure that you are posting to at least 50 high volume threads a week, on multiple sites, you need to INTERACT with the viewers who post on your channel and OTHER social media sites too. Basically YOU NEED TO MAKE NOISE! Finally, Do some collaborations with others on YouTube, in particular channels with more subscribers than you. You are now on your way to developing an engaging channel and community of subscribers. But wait.... there's more....

I\u2019ve also experienced this kind of problem with my first channel about video games. I was really struggling with the first 100 subscribers and was always getting new schemes to get more subs. Let me tell you how can you get more YouTube subscribers: 1.Ask your viewers to subscribeThere might be people watching your YouTube videos right now that haven\u2019t subscribed to you yet. It may not even cross their mind to subscribe without you asking them. So if you want to get more YouTube subscribers for free, just ask! For example, in the intro of your YouTube videos, you can say something like: \u201cHey everyone, welcome back to my channel. If you\u2019re new here, please consider subscribing if you enjoy this video.\u201d It\u2019s as simple as that. 2. Make and announce a schedule of your videos If a user finds your channel and sees that your last video was uploaded 2 months ago, they\u2019re probably not going to subscribe to your channel. YouTube viewers want consistency. So, if you want to gain subscribers fast, your YouTube channel should be like a TV series where users can tune it regularly each week to view your content. Frequently uploading videos will help you attract a ton of new subscribers and help you keep the ones you already have. Start by uploading 1 video every week. 4 videos per month is a good amount of frequency to attract new subscribers and it\u2019s easy enough for you to manage as well. Once you decide on an upload schedule that will work for you and your audience, be sure to announce it in a video. Remember to be specific. Don\u2019t just say \u201cI upload every week,\u201d say \u201cnew uploads every Friday.\u201d 3. Complete Your Profile and Make a Channel Trailer Once you choose a channel theme, you need to attract your first subscribers by completing your profile and making a channel trailer. A channel trailer is a short video that you can upload to help viewers quickly understand what your channel is about. Plus, channel trailers are set to auto-play for users who aren\u2019t subscribed to your channel so it\u2019s a powerful way to turn viewers into subscribers.

            "answer_text": "How do we get subscribers on YouTube? I'm a Youtuber 10 years until now, from my experience to get YouTuber subscribers quite simple. Why do i say that ? There\u2019re various ways to get YouTube subscribers fast and easy. To complete reach it, I am going to tell you a few different ways, then understand all these methods well and use them on your YouTube channel and on other videos. If you use these methods well, you will be able to raise your YouTube channel in the fastest possible time. 1. Create Amazing Content Inspired content is the kind the viewers want, regardless of the niche because no matter how much support you are getting from paid advertisement, your efforts are futile if viewers does not find it compelling. To get the most out of your content, you have to determine your audience. Create the kind of quality that revolves around them. Know what they want, and you will know what you have to generate. Exciting content does not have to come from you all the time. There will come a time when ideas escape you. If you are having a hard time coming up with one, you can scroll through the comments section. It is a pool of many ideas. If not, engage the viewers to leave ideas because that is one of the ways how to get the most views on YouTube \u2013 creating content that your viewers suggest, because that means, that is something would be interested in. 2. Allow Embedding You must be generous with your video is you want to reach more people. That is gained through sharing, and it can only be done if you allow your video to be embedded. This gives your viewers the chance to share your content on their blog or on their social media accounts giving you more reach to audience that you may not have intended the video for. However, these are always a welcomed addition. To enable embedding, just head over to your creator studio and click advanced settings. Under distribution settings, ensure that a tick is on Allow Embedding, otherwise, this will not be possible. 3. Use Other Platforms to Your Advantage Social media is the single most powerful tool in this day and age. Its use could make or a break an internet personality\u2019s presence online. In effect, it is also one of the ways how to views in YouTube. What this does is give you access to audiences from across the world who you may not have from within your locality. Also, it gives you a better chance of getting an audience, especially with the varied niches that you might be into. All you need to do is set-up a page for yourself, and just share constantly the videos that you upload. Once you are big enough, sometimes, they do it for you. However, if they do not, you do not have to worry because websites or applications such as Hootsuite and Buffer can help upload them on platforms based on a set date. Remember that the only way to maximize YouTube is to remember that it was never a standalone platform, and that is its networking power. 4. Quality Over Quantity Quality should always be at the forefront of your channel. That is why it is a must to have compelling videos, otherwise, viewers leave just as soon as they see what you have to offer. Why is this important ? In today\u2019s YouTube algorithm, Watch Time is more important than views alone. This is the span of time that a person stays to watch your video, and the better the quality of your video is, the higher the chance of your viewers staying. You may also want to refer to other videos or channels within your niche. The platform rewards this with \u2018Watch Time Credits\u2019, which is again, credited to your channel. 5. Building a Network You cannot bring in viewers on your own. You need a community to back you up. Nurture a community. Engage with the audience. That is another way how to get more YouTube videos fast. It does not matter whether it is by simply giving a reply to comments left in your video or referring to another content creator within the same niche. You may even drop a comment if you think you should. Starting a conversation creates momentum, and that in turn brings out others who may have the same interests. As a result, the viewer counts rises. 6. It Starts with a Name You would think that a video platform has no use of SEO, but it does, and other than playlist names, sometimes, it all starts with a video\u2019s title. SEO is just as important in YouTube as it is in articles because, at the end of the day, people find results through a search engine run by an algorithm. That is why knowing the right keywords to use is a way how to get more views on to your YouTube channel. You can find the appropriate keywords to use through the suggestion box that appears when you key in the words in the search bar. You can also use websites, or applications, such as Google Trends and Google Adwords Keyword Planner. Also, you may want to keep your titles the lengths of 60 to 70 characters and use only those which relates to your video. Otherwise, YouTube will penalize your channel. 7. Optimize the Platform The internet is not somewhere you hide yourself. It is the place to expose yourself, and you only build yourself, and a community, if you let them know who you are and where to find you. Again, exposure is the key. That is why, if you can, add your social media platforms on your channel, maybe include your website as well if you have one. Experts also suggest that you enable other related content on the platform. Disabling \u2018Related Channels\u2019 is a common mistake that amateurs do. Not only does this deny the community of valuable content, but it also takes away your opportunity to be featured on the recommended page of YouTube, normally found on a viewer\u2019s home page. Self-promotion is never enough. It takes a community to build a brand. 8. A Strong Impression A first impression is not something you would expect in YouTube, but it does. This is through the use of engaging thumbnails which are the first things that a viewer sees when they log on to the platform. Long-time YouTubers would tell you to create customized thumbnails. This gives it more personality and would reflect your brand a lot more, identifying your brand without having to read who uploaded it. 9. Promote the Platform If you have not surmised it just yet, avoid promoting the videos alone. Promote your entire channel, and the platform instead. This can be done by adding a widget on your blog or on your website, if you have one. This gives viewers direct access to your channel with content that they may not have known existed, and see them devour each one, one video at a time. 10. Do Not be Afraid to be Human To show a human side every now and then is how you get more views on YouTube because viewers love a touch of vulnerability. Showing that you are human, and not just another person behind the screen is a way to make yourself relatable which is a strong marketing too in itself, especially today. 11. Grab the Trend Always a last resort, you can get the attention of many others by creating content that is currently trending online. Uploading your own version gets people curious, thus it converts into views. Always focus on what got you there, and that is the niche that you are currently in because that is your way of showing loyalty to those who made your channel what it is. ",

            "answer_text": " You can get more subscribers on Youtube by applying these following tactics 1. Create An Engaging Channel Trailer With the new channel design, YouTube gives content creators a great chance to create a trailer to share what your content is about. Have you ever attended a movie without viewing a trailer? I think most the answer is NO because you want to see what it is about. Keep your trailer under 90 seconds and show scenes from your other videos and provide a strong call to action of why a viewer should become a subscriber. Keep people coming back by putting some effort into your videos. Did you notice I didn\u2019t mention any technical details about lighting, audio and composition? This is because I assume you should know that already. The more comfortable you are on camera the more subscribers you can get. It may take a while, but you can do it. 2. Look for Co-Marketing Opportunities YouTube is a great avenue to co-market your brand with another company. Working with other has become a helpful strategy for many businesses trying to increase their audience size and YouTube subscribers count. Starting with smaller with brands specifically in your industry and maybe focus on those just getting into the game. If you build up a few co-marketing videos with other brands, bigger companies will likely be more willing to participate in your video series. 3. Promote with Subreddits Reddit users organize themselves into subreddits. These are communities based around a topic. Find 10 to 20 subreddits and tell people about your YouTube channel. If your content is horrible and not relevant to the subreddit, Redditors will make fun of you and kick you out of the subreddit. A good rule of thumb for marketing, though, is to only promote and advertise once you have an amazing product. Otherwise, as marketing legend Dan Kennedy puts it, \u201cmarketing only increases the speed people find out your product is awful.\u201d 4. Learn how to optimize your titles. One great way to do this is to give your videos offbeat names. This way, you\u2019re going to be getting a lot of people coming to your channel based on curiosity alone. But to get a maximum amount of views, you will also need to dive into the SEO part of YouTube marketing. Here are a few tips for optimizing your YouTube titles for greater reach: use the keyword in the title, use Google Adwords to identify what people are searching for on the web.Try to tackle videos with a perfect blend of high volume searches and low competition, don\u2019t make the title too long. Google truncates the length of the video down to 66 characters and adds \u2018YouTube |\u2019 before the video (taking an extra 10 characters). Your ideal video title should be no more than 50 characters, make the title descriptive. Give the audience a sneak peek as to what the video will be about. ",

            "answer_text": "Thing more satisfying than hitting a milestone with your videos. One important one is your first 1,000 subscribers. This is important because YouTube offers live streaming once you have achieved this milestone and you have an account in good standing (Since the publishing of this post there has been a change: YouTube now offers live streaming for free for verified non-profit entities. Instead of needing 1,000 subscribers you now need 100 subscribers.) Getting more subscribers can seem like a difficult task, but I\u2019ll share 10 tips to help you get your first 1,000 subscribers. 1. Post Useful Content Consistently This is one of the most difficult things to do as a content creator. If you take a look around YouTube you might think that every video under the sun has been created and that is most likely true, but you can put your own spin on a popular topic. For example, there are many \u201cunboxing\u201d tech videos\u2026what if you created a \u201creboxing\u201d and talk about the various components of tech while you put it back in the box? The key here is creativity and that will certainly boost subscriptions. 2. Name Your Videos Strategically One of the most difficult things is to name your video. You have the name in your head, but it may be something complex or too long. My rule is to keep it basic and use the YouTube autocomplete to name the video. There is nothing wrong with your video having the same name or something close to a popular video, as long as it\u2019s relevant. 3. Spruce Up Your Channel Design Most visitors first impression of you is from your channel and your design. This is where visitors interact and get to know what you are about. Create a engaging header and show off your brand. On my channel, we were intentional about our design making it fit into our overall branding strategy. The key takeaway is to design with purpose. 4. Show Your Lighter Side Lighten up and laugh at yourself. Bloopers make you more human and show something different than an ordinary talking head video. Also, switch up the video and catch your viewers off guard so they don\u2019t know what to expect. 5. Shoot In Various Locations I believe that shooting in various locations can lead to more interest. I understand that may not be possible or you may have a set, but try to change a background or even use a green screen. Like the clich\u00e9 says, \u201cvariety is the spice of life\u201d so mix it up with your backgrounds and locations. 6. Create A Custom Thumbnail I have seen my subscriptions and views increase by adding this step. I use impact font that is seen on many internet photos to grab attention and I format the photo using Adobe Photoshop. I usually title the photo thumbnail differently than the video because when people are scrolling through other videos to view, they can easily tell what my video is about. 7. Use Annotations Annotations are those annoying things that pop up during videos, but they can be a content creator\u2019s dream. I add annotations to every video and make it easy by creating a link for them to subscribe. This is extra work, but once you see your subscription rate increase you will continue to add them to every video. 8. Ask For Subscribers This is very basic. At the end of every video ask viewers to \u201clike\u201d and subscribe to your channel. You should also tell them why they should subscribe, for example if you are a DIY Home Improvement channel I would say, \u201csubscribe for my DIY projects, tricks and insider tips delivered to you weekly.\u201d Remember, be careful what you ask for, because you might get it. 9. Be Yourself You are the best you\u2014you can be. Being on camera was difficult for me at first because I compared myself to others who are natural on camera talent then I realized, \u201cI just have to be me.\u201d Let your personality shine in your videos and I guarantee someone will connect with you. 10. Create An Engaging Channel Trailer With the new channel design, YouTube gives content creators a great opportunity to create a trailer to share what your content is about. Have you ever attended a movie without viewing a trailer? Not me, because you want to see what it is about. Keep your trailer under 90 seconds and show scenes from your other videos and provide a strong call to action of why a viewer should become a subscriber. Keep people coming back by putting some effort into your videos. Did you notice I didn\u2019t mention any technical details about lighting, audio and composition? This is because I assume you should know that already. The more comfortable you are on camera the more subscribers you can get. It may take a while, but you can do it. What other methods do you use to get subscribers on YouTube? Leave in the comments below. ",

            "answer_text": "Are you wondering how to get people from YouTube to your website? Are you looking for ideas to move people from watchers to clickers? Keep reading to learn how. 1.\tPost new content regularly It's the same as on Facebook or Instagram, and regular YouTube interaction keeps subscribers from forgetting you. If you only post 1 video and wait for the followers to come to you then it is a silly idea! Conversely, if you regularly share videos that interest them, engaging your followers will have a reason to press the Subscribe button on your channel. No need to share too many and too many videos, you need to choose a regular and regular video submission strategy. Video content must also be attractive, practical and innovative so that users do not feel bored. 2.\tFocus on the first 10 seconds According to statistics, 49% of readers read only 111 words or less on the site they visited. For video content sharing, getting noticed with the viewer from the very first moment is extremely important. According to the statistics, a perfect video will have a duration of about 2.7 minutes. Therefore, your task is to entice viewers in the first few seconds. 3.\t Call to Action Strategy A call to action is needed for a YouTube video as this is the opportunity to turn a regular viewer into a subscriber - even in the long run it can become your potential customer. Instead of calling them straight to your website, encourage viewers to share videos and spread the message. While organic ways take time to boost your views and they aren\u2019t effective all the time, you wanna drive a huge traffic to your YouTube channel, think about purchasing Youtube views/subscribers. It means you will need get high-quality YouTube users. They can offer from 100 to 1,000+ likes, provide a comment plan, ranging from 10 to 100+ comments alongside views. You can than customize the comments you want to receive, or have users create postive comments themselves. The best service that I\u2019ve used and highly recommend you is Boost Socials which is the best-rating company in the list. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are some ways you can do just that. 1. Create a \"channel trailer\" Many YouTube channels show a channel trailer at the top of their page that autoplays when visitors check them out. Create a \u201ctrailer\u201d video of your own that you can show to unsubscribed visitors on your page to quickly tell them what to expect from you. The benefit of creating a unique trailer for this spot is that you can stitch together footage from your past videos or deliver your \u201cpitch\u201d directly to your audience and ask them to subscribe. Here's a great example from How to Cake It that conveys the channel's focus (making cake), tone (having fun with cake), and personality (passionate about cake). 2. Come up with a pitch for your YouTube channel An elevator pitch is an often underestimated tool that\u2019s relevant to all self-starters, whether you\u2019re an entrepreneur, a freelancer, or a creator.  And YouTubers are no exception. This pitch can be used in your About section, your intro, your closing, or wherever you need to quickly communicate what your channel is about. Most YouTubers already end their videos by saying something along the lines of, \u201cIf you liked this video, please hit the thumbs up, leave a comment, and subscribe.\u201d But this call to action can be enhanced by creating an outro that speaks to the content that\u2019s to come rather than what viewers just watched. Your pitch can be as simple as: I post [videos you post] every [when you post] or a teaser for what's next. These couple of seconds capture the essence of your channel's content in a way that gives new viewers a reason to hit that subscribe button. 3. Buy Youtube views to kickstart your Youtube channels Consumers are naturally attracted to content that has been shared with them or they have heard about from another source. When a person finds your video, the more views that it has, the more likely your audience is to watch it and listen to its message with an open mind. This goes hand in hand with developing a reputation as a producer of valuable content, since your credibility will largely be a factor of your popularity. This boost in your credibility is invaluable when it comes to increasing sales stemming from your video.  If you are looking for a website to Buy Youtube Views, I confidently recommend for you This One. I\u2019ve been working with them for many times and just realize some factors: Quality of Views \u2013 AG provide high-quality followers. Their followers are all look real, which have profile pictures, some videos and active. Turnaround Time \u2013 They deliver the goods on time. Often within 1-2 hours after customer ordered. Customer Service \u2013 Their staffs are very helpful, friendly and they answer all question thoroughoutly. Money Back Guarantee \u2013 This is arguably the biggest factor. If a company doesn\u2019t offer a good refund policy, then they don\u2019t deserve our recommendation. Thanks God, all packages of AG are covered with 100% money back guarantee to keep you in safe. 4. Collaborate with other YouTubers with similar audiences Collaborations aren\u2019t uncommon on YouTube and are a great way to get exposure to a whole new audience. You can reach out to a YouTuber you know or would like to partner with and suggest an idea for cross-promotion. A common approach is to have your proposed partner appear in one of your videos and vice versa, each of you getting an endorsement in front of the other creator\u2019s audience.  Here\u2019s an example of when Sean Evans of Hot Ones interviewed Harley Morenstein of Epic Meal Time over hot wings. Sean then appeared on Epic Meal Time to cook up the spiciest ribs ever. Both channels are about taking food to the next level and both entertain you in similar ways\u2014it's a match made in heaven. ",

Use Playlists : Curate your content in an organized manner such that it catches the eye of users Your content should resonate with the users. 2. Publish LONG Videos (10+ Minutes) From my experience longer videos greater than 4 min have more chances to rank on youtube. 3. Promote Videos In Your End Screen Don't forget to promote video at the end screen, youtube has made it easy for us in their editor. 4. Focus On Quality\u2026 Not Quantity Create quality content don't as content speaks for itself. 5. Reply To EVERY Comment Connecting with your audience to develop trust in your channel which makes them view your new videos 6. Funnel People to \u201cSubscriber Magnets\u201d Identity the videos which are making more views and promote them. 7. Embed YouTube Videos Share your content across your other social media. 8.

It could be as simple as \u2018waking up early for a run\u2019.b) Feedback - ask subscribers about their valuable feedback in the comments section on YouTube.c) Interact - with people during video, as if you are talking to them and also try to reply to every single comment that lands up on your channel\u2019s comment section. Share contact, email or any other medium through which people can reach out to you. Do remember, people are Real and Active all the time. We should not wait for them to come to us.

            "answer_text": " General advice: to get more subs on Youtube you need your channel to appear among other famous channels. If you want to get your videos into similar videos of the other famous YouTube channel, it is necessary to select a topic, tags, keys, and description correctly. However, it does not always work that way for you. On the flip side, it seems like you do everything right but a source of traffic of your channel stills a channel with a small number of views. How Youtube algorithm works? Once you create a new channel, it is on the very bottom of the youtube suggested videos. For example, you have less than 1000 views per mouth. Thus, your channel appears among the other channels with a small number of subscribers, and YouTube suggests you to them automatically. And so, let's say, your channel suddenly gets into a recommended videos of the unusual for you famous channel. It means you are slowly but surely moving to a new stage. YouTube will be more put your videos among popular ones, and soon this process will become familiar to you. The algorithm is composed of three parts: Stage one. Your channel will be on the first stage for about two months or more. Less than 1000 views per month. Stage two. Then, the rate of your channel suddenly increases to the 100,000 or 200,000 per month. Stage three. Your channel grows X2-X3 again. When everything is properly done it teas you six month to grow from 1000 views to 1M+ views. Normally, this is a scheme of work for every new channel on YouTube. The transition to the next stage usually begins with a large number of views in real time. Such peaks do not last longer than two-three days. When an interest of viewers\u2019 falls by 50-60%, the average number of views increases compared to the previous period. Sometimes, the growth rate does not slow down, and the channel goes to the next stage without falling. If it happens, it means a real success. Just keep doing what you do! Well, it is just a small secret of the YouTube's algorithms for beginners. However, nobody knows how the system works, and only long-term experience and insider data can give the information what you need. ",

An increasing quantity of brands are depending upon original content to catch their audience's attention, rather than jogging traditional ad campaigns. Buy youtube subscribers Video content is just one among the absolute most popular types of content marketing. In fact, YouTube is the largest search engine using just six thousand hours of video viewed on a monthly basis and 300 hrs of video uploaded each single moment. Create searchable names Many men and women see matters to watch with YouTube's search bar, and also you also have to bear that in your mind as you name your own videos. Your names will incorporate the key words they would logically search if you are searching for your information inside the video. Bringing viewers for a YouTube videos follows exactly the same general idea as optimizing your site. You will have to choose key terms and add them on your names and descriptions to arrive if customers search for videos to the own topic. Compose a script Have you watched a video that was assumed to be informational, however it was clear that they had attempted to\"wing it\" This approach will work, however usually it really is painful to watch and a tiny bit expressive. Videos are useful if they are organized using a script to continue to keep you on track. The logical stream of one's video, the more beneficial it's going to probably likely be to viewers and also the greater of these will soon develop right into subscribers. Publish always I love watching Grey's Anatomy just about each and each single Thursday at 8:00 p.m. and a few among the main reasons the reason is that I understand I can trust an hour or so Meredith gray weekly. In the event the series ceased third regular program, and that I really don't understand when to assume it, then I'd most likely lose attention and continue forward. That's the reason consistency is critical. Ask your viewers to subscribe It may seem clear, nevertheless, you need to always ask your viewers to subscribe at the conclusion of each video. Viewers want to get advised what direction to go. After the video they truly are watching is visiting an end, add a call-to-action to subscribe. Asking viewers to subscribe would be similar to asking readers to subscribe for a own email listing. ",

            "answer_text": "Seems I have found another me in this question!.This is the same question I was asking myself since I started the YouTube channel . Though I did a lot of things right, there were no new subscribers and the number of views sucked!. By spending a lot of time studying how to get more views, I have learned a lot from other YouTubers and here is a penny from my side to those aspiring YouTubers!. The first and most important thing we all need to learn is how to make quality content. You should select a niche and stick to it while making videos to attract subscribers. If you go after every trending videos and remake it, probably they will not subscribe or even unsubscribe your channel considering the content as not appropriate!.  To grow a channel, you need to get more views on your old videos and you need to tweak your keywords, description, tags and thumbnail to get so. You may do it manually but it does take a lot of time and effort. Lucky that, there are tools to help you with this - no, I am not marketing them but giving you an insight if you are not familiar with it. I would give you a sneak peek into two of the tools I tried and both have free and paid versions and you may need only free version until you get monetized. The first one is vidIQ- they give a lot of details and insights about other youtube channels, videos and subscriptions. But most of them are not useful for a new YouTuber and their paid versions are so pricy that a newcomer may not afford. (strictly my opinion!) The second one is Tubebuddy - This is rather a simple version of VidIQ but gives more features on the free version. I am using the free version and you can see the difference in both views and subscribers on my channel once I started it six weeks back. The most useful feature of TubeBuddy is the keyword explorer- it helps you to plan your next videos by showing the search volume, optimisation strength etc of the targeted topic by giving you the exact keyword suggestions. For instance, if you are a creator who is focusing on new YouTubers, a keyword on \"how to get more subscribers\" can be entered in the search field and it will give you the details and more suggested keywords!.  There are plenty of tutorial videos available on their website, please spend some time to watch and learn how to use this amazing tool!. Sign up now, use it for a month and if you think it helped you to grow instantly, you may purchase their paid version. They are cheap, will not make a hole in your pocket as some other tools do!.

Here the two important thing you should kept in mind. Content is the king Try to improve the content of the video. Quality CONTENT means the purpose of video should full filed the need of those audience for whom you are making the video. For improving the quality do the following things When you made a video whatch it and see are you satisfied with your own video or not or think can you improve this more than improve it try this again and again, then you will get awesome videoAudience should understand what your are explaining them, for this ask your friend to get the feedback it help you to know where audience will not understand and make it easier. Now remember people will share only those things which they like themselves. So if your video has good content people surely share it and when they share it they will like it and subscribe it. 2. Promotion Promote your video to your target audience only for eg if you made a gaming video then you should share it to those who are interested in gaming. If you share it with those who are not interested may be they will open the video for 2 sec and then cancel it because of no interest.  Take a paper and write down where you will find those people who are interested in your content then advertise to those people only. You can JOIN various groups on Facebook related to your content and you can advertise it for free but these free promotion Don't give you high no. Of subscribers.

            "answer_text": "Hello! I\u2019ll use a bit of a previous answer\u2026 As with any other business, you need to look for a gap in the market. Why should people watch you? Compare your channel to one with similar content. What makes yours different, better? Now about audience. It's all fine and dandy if your content is high-quality, humorous and interesting, but you may be attracting only a small number of people. Let's use video games as an example. As you may know, Fortnite has blown up recently and it's the only thing people are talking about. Say I wanted to play Animal Crossing. I could make a 10/10, high quality video packed with jokes. However I doubt it would blow up as everyone's focus is on Fortnite. It's the only demand these days. Unless you wanna be brave and you wanna break through this all! Maybe you wanna revive the Animal Crossing series! However this would be very hard and if you're looking for a more definite, stable increase in views, then I would try and adjust your videos to fit in with what people are looking for currently. Does that make sense? And marketing! Some movies spend millions dollars on marketing their film, even more than the actual production of the film. In terms of Youtube, your best bet would be to set up Instagram pages, Twitter pages, stuff like that. Get involved with the community you're trying to reach out to. Try to avoid getting involved with stuff like \u2018sub for sub\u2019, and spamming in people\u2019s comment sections. It gets very annoying and gives you a bad reputation. There's probably quite a few more factors, but i hope these ones will help you. :) ",

            "answer_text": "1.\tCollaborate with other YouTubers with similar audiences Collaborations aren\u2019t uncommon on YouTube and are a great way to get exposure to a whole new audience. You can reach out to a YouTuber you know or would like to partner with and suggest an idea for cross-promotion. A common approach is to have your proposed partner appear in one of your videos and vice versa, each of you getting an endorsement in front of the other creator\u2019s audience. 2.\tCreate a \"channel trailer\" Many YouTube channels show a channel trailer at the top of their page that autoplays when visitors check them out. Create a \u201ctrailer\u201d video of your own that you can show to unsubscribed visitors on your page to quickly tell them what to expect from you. The benefit of creating a unique trailer for this spot is that you can stitch together footage from your past videos or deliver your \u201cpitch\u201d directly to your audience and ask them to subscribe. 3.\tFind out real organic subscribers All the subscribers will stay forever because they are genuine and real. The people are sourced from a managed community of individuals who have registered to be informed of new music, products and services via social media channels. A huge amount of organic subscribers can come from a reputation Youtube promotion service. It is easy to do a search with the top rank companies such as Boost Socials. 4.\tUnderstand what you\u2019re doing wrong. It can be anything from your descriptions to your tags, titles, thumbnails, etc. So, learn about the mistakes you\u2019re making from other YouTube creators who have been there and done that and remember not to make the same mistakes going forward. Learning how to get subscribers on YouTube fast is not an easy feat for everyone. It pays to be patient, learn from others, and learn from your own experiences. When you see something that\u2019s working, repeat it. When you see something that\u2019s not working, throw it away and focus more on what does. 5.\tOptimize your videos to improve search rankings The best way to get more subscribers is by appearing at the top of Google and YouTube search rankings. Pack your video title and description with keywords that viewers will use to find content similar to yours. Use Google Keyword Planner to find the most searched video keywords. A top ranking search result translates to thousands of potential subscribers. ",

Trust me, if you've been thinking about buying subscribers to grow your YouTube channel, this is going to save you a lot of pain. Because put simply, you don't want to do it. And this is the main reason why. These are YouTube's Terms of Service. You probably haven't read them, and that wouldn't surprise me because nobody ever reads them. Especially when they are this long. But if you have intentions of buying subscribers, then you may want to read Permissions and Restrictions section 6, which states that you are not allowed to do the following: Cause or encourage any inaccurate measurements of genuine user engagement with the Service, including by paying people or providing them with incentives to increase a video's views, likes or dislikes, or to increase a channel's subscribers, or otherwise manipulate metrics. So it doesn't matter where you bought your subscribers from, and it doesn\u2019t matter how much they promise your subscribers are legitimate, and will genuinely watch your content. Ultimately, you have paid somebody to try and artificially grow your channel, and to manipulate YouTube's metrics, and that is against Terms of Service. And the buck stops there. YouTube are the gatekeepers, and if they find out what you've been doing, then your channel will most likely be suspended or terminated. ",

If your doing closer to $5 a day, then discovery will be the way to go since you\u2019ll be able to stretch your budget a little more that way. 4. After 7 days, pause all your ads and take a look at which one got you the most subscribers. As a secondary matric take a look at which audience watched the longest.

            "answer_text": "Do you have dreams of becoming the next big YouTube star? Or maybe you have a business that you want to promote to your target audience. Whatever your reason, this platform is an excellent way to engage with consumers and build your brand. YouTube is the 2nd most visited website globally, with over 1.9 billion people logging in every month. Due to the volume of people visiting the site, new channels are aggressively popping up across the platform. If you hope to make it big on YouTube, you have to get your first 1000 subscribers. Unfortunately, that climb from 0 to 1000 is the hardest part of the journey. We want to make it a little bit easier for business owners and soloprenuers trying to grow their first channel. We will provide some helpful tips that you can use to improve your subscriber count, engagement, and visibility. Choose a Schedule and NicheYour audience expects you to post relevant content consistently. If you\u2019re posting a travel vlog one day, a video game review the following day, and a cooking tutorial over the weekend, you\u2019re going to leave people feeling confused. Instead of knowing what to expect, they may decide to wait until one of your videos that appeals lands in their feed. When you consider that over 500 hours of content get uploaded to YouTube every minute, it\u2019s easy to see why consistency is essential. People seek out channels that post content that they want to see. The truth is, there are plenty of other channels that can offer specific content if you\u2019re not consistent. It all boils down to picking a niche and sticking with it. Find something you love and want to talk about if you\u2019re a solopreneur. Business owners can create videos about their products or industry. Speaking of staying consistent, you should try to keep a regular schedule. This will ensure that your subscribers will know when to check in for your latest posts. If you\u2019re able to build trust with your audience by delivering great content on time, they will become the foundation of your channel. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two methods you can use if you want to get YouTube subscribers: 1 - A \"natural\" way: setting up a YouTube channel, selecting a niche for your videos, creating a number of videos, promoting the videos and thereby achieving the target audience - subscribers. 2- An \"unnatural way\" - buying subscribers. If you choose the second way you have to invest just as you do with the first, however, it does provide you with a significant shortcut. I'm going to focus on buying subscribers in this answer because I have a lot of personal and professional experience with this method. A very popular way to promote a YouTube channel or YouTube videos is by using a promotional services provider, meaning a seller offering subscribers, views, likes or comments for sale. A lot of YouTubers (big and small) use these services. Case in point, buying subscribers give you a boost to success in the and save you the difficult start. The problem with buying subscribers is knowing you're getting your money's worth. What I mean is that some of these sellers are pretty much scammers, and this whole field is so unmoderated that people don't always realize what they're getting themselves into. In other cases, you can just look up reviews online, but in these cases, you'll find that most sellers write their own reviews about themselves, so these opinions aren't objective. Now, I'm not going to recommend a certain service because I can suggest a review website for you to look at if you're looking to get more YouTube subscribers. If you'll click on the link I just provided, you'll get to a website called Brands-Reviews which is basically a life saver in my field of business: this website reviews service providers in the promotional services realm and gives the most honest, through opinion, both on good aspects of every seller and on the bad, so no one is specifically targeted in any way.

In addition, not only will you be able to get real user subscribers, but you can also get two more like views and likes in the same package that saves you more money and time. It's really hard to compete on YouTube, especially when you're new and don't have any credibility with the brand of your video. You'd first need to create branding before you can expand your YouTube channel. Some of the easiest ways to do that are to get the subscribers, views and likes to your channel and some of your most-watched videos from actual people. This is a little boost method that you can use safely to grow your channel effectively and gain leverage over other competitors. This would only work to increase the visibility of your channel at first but in the end, you'd have to do some of the hacks that I'd share below; Use annotations: The notes on your videos are annotations on YouTube. By adopting some of the strategies here you can use them to help you maximize your audience;Call for action - Create something like a sticky note and encourage people to subscribe to your channel. Spotlight annotation - This will allow you to create a clickable annotation on your own video. It's going to help drive traffic to the landing or product page. Link to other videos - You can also use annotation to promote other related videos, whether they are yours or not. Properly planned out a good video to your channel: Here are some best plan for you;Keyword Research - You wouldn't get traffic, let alone high-quality traffic if you didn't do your research with the right keywords. The Google Keywords tool will show you exactly what's hot and has the highest volume and avoid long-tail keywords. Transcript - After the video has been recorded, grab the transcript and upload it to YouTube. This will give Google more context to help index it and give you an additional number of words to help people search. Social media engagement - Connect with the other social networks and post the video on Facebook, Twitter, and so on two or three times a week. The more you share, the more love you will get later on into your picture. Add featured channels: Through working with other content creators on YouTube you will increase your audience. This choice can be found on your YouTube channel page. Everything you have to do is click on the modules, other platforms, save any modifications you've made. Attach a channel or channels, and save them. Make sure the videos are picked in the same niche as yours and you think that your viewers will find it beneficial.So, it's best to stick to all other social indicators for actual users subscribers and never opted for bots or spam, no matter what.

            "answer_text": "Creating great content is important, yes, but it's not the only thing you should do. You have to make sure people can find you and your videos. And there are a couple of steps you can take for that:  Create relevant content. Find out what people are looking for, and make content about it. Right now, post match analyses of World Cup games are in high demand. Whenever a Game of Thrones episode airs, people are looking for reviews right after it. I once uploaded a video about a football coach that was just fired on a brand new (empty) channel. It got 7,000 views in only two days. Of course, you should always create content that you like to make, but if you can tie it to current affairs, that's always a win.Add value to your channel. Be sure to know what your channel is about and what people get out of subscribing you. I have a successful YouTube channel on which I give tips for starting YouTubers. If people watch my videos, they get some valuable info that they can use for their channels. And after watching that video, they want more tips, so they subscribe. If your videos are informative, inspirational or very entertaining, convince people that they can get more of that stuff if they subscribe to you.Work on your channel. Think up a nice title. Create a good banner. Get yourself a nice profile picture. Be sure to fill in the channel description. Include keywords in your channel settings (in the Video Manager). Create a good channel trailer. Use playlists for your content. In short: make your channel look appealing and inviting.Upload regularly. This is really important! Create new content on a regular basis. If people see that you haven't uploaded anything new for a long time, they won't subscribe to you. And people who have subscribed to you will forget why they did that in the first place.Make your subscriptions and likes public. This is very important for step 6. You can do this in your channel settings.Communicate with other YouTubers. You're not alone on that big website, even if it can feel that way when you've just started out. There are thousands of people who start out on YouTube every day. Get to know a couple of them. I've built a website called The YouTube ChannelCrawler, which lists thousands and thousands of YouTube channels. Not just the big ones, but especially the smaller ones. Look for interesting channels in the 0 to 250 subscriber range. Subscribe to them (they'll get an e-mail if you did step 5). Write nice comments on their videos. Support them. In short: be an active and loyal viewer to other YouTubers. A lot of them will appreciate that a lot and take a look at your channel as well. And those who don't and who never reply can be easily unsubscribed. Just keep in mind that you should never demand or expect people to subscribe you back. If you give your support to others, unconditionally and relentlessly, you will get the same support back.Hope this helps. Good luck, and post a link to your YouTube channel in a comment to this answer. I wouldn't mind taking a look at it :). ",

            "answer_text": "13 Ways To Increase Your YouTube Subscribers 1. Monitor \u201cattention score\u201d to measure good storytelling YouTube executive Bing Chen says, \u201cAnother thing that cannot be replaced is good storytelling. We really recommend you go into your dashboard and look at your attention score.\u201d What exactly is your attention score? This shows you the level of attention and the length of time people spend watching your videos. Here\u2019s what makes a great entertaining video: Five-second rule \u2013 A great entertaining video must grab people in the first five seconds. You can use questions or put yourself into an unusual situation. And don\u2019t forget the conflict. People have to get a feeling of suspense immediately.Storytelling \u2013 Bing Chen says this is essential. Learn the tricks of weaving a good story so that people will hang with you through the duration of the video. You can use gimmick or conflict to achieve that.Short \u2013 Entertaining videos can\u2019t be too long. Between one and three minutes is ideal. This is where looking at your attention score is critical. Where are people dropping off? Is that the upper reaches of attention span?Early attention score is low \u2013 Most of the traffic drops off early. People decide quickly whether they will learn what they want to learn from a video.Late attention score is high \u2013 Those who stay past the two or three minute mark will typically stay for the entire video.Steps \u2013 Great informative videos pull people along by giving them systematic steps to accomplish a particular task. In fact, people may tend to pause the video and write notes or actually perform the task. Think about how you would learn to fold a paper airplane or fix a sink.Length \u2013 It doesn\u2019t matter how long your informative video is as long as you are giving people the answers they need.2. Five steps to planning a good video Keyword research \u2013 You won\u2019t get traffic, let alone high-quality traffic, if you don\u2019t do your research with keywords. Google\u2019s keyword tool will show you what\u2019s hot and has the highest volume. Avoid the long-tail keywords.Transcript \u2013 After you\u2019ve recorded the video, grab the transcript and upload it to YouTube. This will give Google more context to help index it and give you an additional number of words to help people searching.Social Media Engagement \u2013 Work your social networks. Share the video two or three times a week on Facebook, Twitter and Google+ each. The more shares you can get, the more your video will rise in the rankings.Your Blog \u2013 After about a week, embed the video on your site. Then you can go through the process of sharing it again.Read More Wait 5 second skip ad open link ",

            "answer_text": "There is no way to 100% guarantee that you will get a lot of subscribers, but here are some tips to increase your odds. Make quality content. Spend time planning out your videos, don\u2019t just make a video for the sake of making a video. If your videos are interesting, people will want to watch them and subscribe.Have good lighting. If your videos look like they were filmed in a dark basement, people won\u2019t want to subscribe to you.Learn about Search Engine Optimization. I\u2019m still far from an expert in terms of SEO, but having a basic understanding about using key words and tags really helps you rank in YouTube search.Make eye-catching thumbnails. Thumbnails are very important because it\u2019s one of the first things people see. If you\u2019re thumbnail is awful, no one will click on your video and subscribe.Reply to comments. You want to create a community on your channel. If you respond to people who comment on your videos, they feel like they have a personal connection with you. They\u2019re more likely to stay and subscribe because you\u2019ve had a conversation with them.Comment on other people\u2019s channels. Find other channels that make similar content and comment something. Don\u2019t promote yourself, just try to establish a connection. They may read your comment and check out your channel and subscribe. This is also a great way to find people to collab with, which goes along with my next tip\u2026\u2026.Collab with people. Collaborations are a great way to grow your YouTube audience. Find people who are willing to collab with you and do it!Post consistently. People tend to subscribe to channels who post regularly. If you aren\u2019t putting out consistent content, your chances of growing on YouTube decrease substantially.Ask people to subscribe. It may sound simple, but asking people to subscribe can sometimes help grow your channel. While it\u2019s constantly on the mind of the video creator, it\u2019s not always on the mind of the viewer. Sometimes the viewer didn\u2019t even think about subscribing, but will if you ask them.I hope these tips help! Remember, it takes time to grow a channel. These tips will help you, but it won\u2019t make you a YouTube sensation over night. Have a great day! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi I've been following a lot of youtubers for a while now and saw a lot of their videos in which they shared how they grew their channel and so on,so basically almost all of them gave the same advice in different words which I would like to share with you ,hope it helps you. 1. Never work for the subscriber count and views : Yes you heard that right, if you're working mainly for the subscriber base, views,money ,fame etc. then this is just not meant for you because it takes time and patience to grow the channel and if someone tells you that they grew their channel overnight then they are simply lying through their teeth,so if you are not passionate about it and simply driven by the materialistic benefits then you won't be able to continue it for long and simply lose the motivation in between which can prove to be detrimental for the channel . 2. Have a great content : Great content means either entertain the crowd and there are a lot of ways to do it like by making vines or sketches, roasting ,reacting to other videos,vlogging,exploring haunted sites and so on or educate them by teaching a subject or creating a tutorial on how to do something etc and if you could develop your own niche which is eccentric then it can help you even more because creative disruptors have always grown faster than anyone else ,take example of the Indian youtube channel \u201cmake joke of\u201dwhich has amassed more than 2 million subscribers in a record time because it gave the audience something different in the form of animated cartoons. 3. Engage with your audience : If you want to build your subscriber base rapidly then build a rapport with your subscribers ,ask them what they would like to see in the next video or by replying to their comments etc. 4 . Consistency : This is the most clich\u00e9 amongst all the points but it is indeed the most important point. CASEY NEISTAT one of my favourite vloggers once said in a video that his friend ROMAN ATWOOD another big youtuber (prankster and now vlogger ) advised him three words as the secret sauce to grow on youtube and they were \u201cjust keep uploading\u201d(here's the link: 3 words got me 3 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS )and casey even did daily vlogging for 534 days which resulted in an exponential growth in his subscriber base and even if you look at the other big youtubers like pewdiepie ,markiplier or jacksepticeye, they all have uploaded more than three thousand videos which shows their amazing consistency level and that is also the secret of their success, if you have a great content and you supplement it with great consistency, the watch time of your videos shoots up and youtube suggests such videos more often and this was also one of the reasons how pewdiepie became the biggest youtuber. You can watch the video explained by the game theory below Game Theory: How PewDiePie Conquered YouTube 5. Smart marketing strategy : Now if you're not visible to others even though you're making a great content on a regular basis then all your hard work will go down the drain,so create a proper marketing strategy to promote yourself, apart from sharing the videos on various social media platforms ask your family members, close friends to share your video with their friends ,also use Google adwords, keyword planner to know the trend and popular topics and make interesting videos around those topics and keep doing that,the initial subscriber base is difficult to build but once you build a loyal audience then the growth becomes exponential,it's like a snowballing effect. 6. Do it only because you're passionate about it : if you love making videos then you'll definitely gain traction from people. I can recall a line which is written in the letter received by youtubers who achieve landmarks like 100 k and 1m subscribers which says 10 m is not far away either,remember the time when you had only few hundreds of subscribers and you wished to achieve 100 k or a million subscribers one day so have faith in your abilities and don\u2019t be in a lookout of shortcuts.

            "answer_text": "Marketing is the biggest thing. If you can afford the publicity then great, otherwise you can still do it but it will be slower. Here are some suggestions to get more subscribers on YouTube. Optimize your YouTube video for search engines  Make sure your YouTube video title includes the keywords your viewers will search for. Then, when you write a video description, make sure to include those keywords / phrases. Do not sacrifice flow or clarity for keyword density. Google rewarded for good content and punished keyword stuffing. Once your YouTube videos show more with search engines, they will also show up better to your viewers as they find your content easier. Each new viewer is a new potential subscriber! Use keywords in the title. This has a greater impact on SEO in the past, but it still has a big impact on the video. Google's crawlers do not view videos in the way they read blog posts, so placing keywords in the title will allow Google bots to know the content of your video. Add an end screen to promote your video, channel, or website End screens are interactive graphics that link to another video, playlist, channel or site, or prompts someone to subscribe to your channel. As the feature name suggests, you can only add a screen that ends in the last 20 seconds of the video, so you have to plan where the display ends. Collaborate with other YouTube users A great way to increase subscribers is by appearing on other YouTube Channels. Try to select channels whose subscribers might be interested in your video. The best way to do this is to become part of Google's dedicated community. Create a list of YouTubers and then contact each of them. Regularly post new content Consistency is always the key to any social network. Posting once and waiting for new subscribers or subscribers is simply not working. On the other hand, when you post regularly and continually add new content to your channel, you give users a reason to subscribe. ",

Usually people want to see something that people usually go to YouTube on the watch. Increasing the subscriber is becoming a must for those who make YouTube. Here are 4 tips extremely effective that I want to introduce to you. First and foremost, I want you to pay attention to the quality of Videos. Nobody wants to watch and share your video when video content is tedious, of poor quality, and of poor audio. You have to make high quality video content, HD quality, clear sound, concise content full of ideas that you think your customers want to hear, not long.  Once your content is good, quality. Viewers will share and spread your video to thousands of other viewers, and the view will increase naturally. The second is posting videos regularly This will create a habit for your viewers to remember, so clearly schedule the playback and frequency of the video. No one wants to follow a channel that has posted a whole video for a whole year. Please follow this rule. Use Annotations Annotations are the little colorful sticky notes that people paste all over their videos once they've been uploaded to YouTube. Although this tool is often overused, and few strategically placed annotations can make a difference for your YouTube marketing efforts. And finally USING THE TOOLS TO INCREASE CHANNEL TURN REGISTER Want to make money on YouTube, need to invest, care for the channel, pull view, increase subscribe. However, to protect the channel you should choose the method of increasing sub secure. ",

I will share with you a number of ways that I think are most effective to get more YouTube subscribers, and not only are they the most effective, but they will also bring you to get a lot of subscribers in a quick and in the correct way. My recommendation is to combine all the ways to get as many subs as possible and as much success as possible on YouTube, but even if you adopt one tip you will see an improvement. So, let's start. My first tip is to do your own marketing. what do I mean? Very simply, market your YouTube channel. In today's network, it is very easy to market yourself, everyone has a profile in all kinds of social networks, and in every social network, everyone has a few dozens if not hundreds of friends/followers who follow him in a few social networks. Aside from social networks, there are a lot of blog and forums platforms and lots of sites where you can publish your YouTube channel easily and free. So, feel free to use all the platforms I mentioned, wherever possible Share and Tell that you have a YouTube channel, that will bring to your channel more subscribers! My second tip is to create connections on YouTube. comment on videos that belong to your niche, contact people who create videos in your niche, and by creating these relationships you will expose your channel to your targeted viewers that will be interesting to be your future subscribers.

You can change the way they think, the way they walk, the way they talk. It changes.  Here are a few tips I have for you to grow your YouTube channel. Add Video AnnotationsAnnotations are a great way for your viewers to watch your other videos, to push your views across your channel. Learn more in our article, How to Use YouTube Annotations to Maximize Your Subscribers, View & Overall YouTube Success, and See Annotations in Action in the video below. We create a collection of viral video collections and use annotations to link all the unique videos together, to entice the audience to see not just one video, but all the videos in the collection. 2. Create an impressive trailer This video will automatically play when a new viewer has not subscribed to your channel. You should make a video that is short enough for viewers to watch the video and subscribe to it. Get great results if you generate traffic. 3. Length of video length For new content creators to start using YouTube, this is a golden rule and always remember to do it. When you start making videos, you can experiment with different length videos, and watch the audience respond to the appropriate adjustments. Often, videos that are rated well will not exceed 3 minutes in length. So the advice I want to send to you is make the video short, simple, informative, entertaining and under 5 minutes. 4.  And the most important thing is the content of the video. If the video content is attractive and quality then there is no need for tricks, you also have millions of sub channels. Content that works the best is content that is either entertaining or informative. The content that really works the best is content that is entertaining AND informative. This is pretty standard with any kind of content marketing, but in particular, videos that inform and entertain are usually the most successful. ",

Like every other job, it takes a lot of hard work and determination, more than most people think. YouTube is not a free ticket to success in any way, shape, form, or fashion, despite what some assume. YouTube is a place where you can make content for others to enjoy, it is a creative outlet, and that alone is what separates it from some other jobs.There are some ways you can grab people\u2019s attention. #1 Good Thumbnails- Yeah I get it, seems trivial right? Well, not really. To get people to subscribe they must be interested in the content you make, and before they get interested in your personality and see your video they must (obviously) watch your video. How do you grab said attention? Make good thumbnails, it will stir interest. #2 Good Title - Same psychology as the first one, make it look professional. #3 Good (honest) Promotion - DO NOT go on other people\u2019s channels and comment asking to subscribe, as a content creator myself, i block every single channel that does it\u2026 you come to my channel as a place to enjoy MY content, not promote your own. Make a twitter, tweet regularly. Make a Facebook, post regularly. Tell friends and family, seems weird\u2026 but family will be a good place of support sometimes. Reddit works for a good amount of YouTubers as well. #4 Network - Find channels as your own, and collaborate with them! Even if you\u2019re mainly solo it won\u2019t hurt! Maybe you\u2019ll find good friends and some of their subs will leak to you and vice-versa. #5 Be honest and creative - Easier said then done, I understand, but it\u2019s okay to do a similar video style, it\u2019s okay to have inspiration, but be sure to not copy other people. If you be original and do things your own way you will develop your own sense of style. #6 Be confident and persistent - This one is my personal toughie, spending a good amount of time on a video and it not getting the feedback you hoped for, keep pushing, unless you are EXTREMELY LUCKY you are not going to be successful overnight, work hard. Keep at it. Be confident in the content you provide, confidence and persistence breeds IMPROVEMENT. #7 Last, but certainly not least. WORK HARD - This one goes with number 6, but work as hard as you can, even if you\u2019re not a god at video-making right off the bat, upload it anyways. Put it out there and you eventually will breed your own sense of style. KEEP AT IT! Thanks for reading, I hope I helped! Cheers! :D ",

            "answer_text": "Use custom thumbnails for videos One way to make your channel look great is by adding custom thumbnails.  These images are used in place of the specific screenshot of your video. If you don't use a custom thumbnail, you may have poor and unedited photos. This looks even worse when the picture captures you while you talk. Upload continuously Your channel will grow much faster if you are consistent with uploading new and new content. Decide how many videos you want to upload every week and day and when you will upload new videos. Make sure that you set realistic goals that you can stick to, your viewers will be disappointed if you promise to upload a new video but rather than not uploading anything. The set schedule also makes it easy for your viewers to know when to expect new videos. Create attractive intro videos Keep people coming back by putting some effort into your video. Did you notice I didn't mention any technical details about lighting, sound and composition? This is because I suppose you should know it. The more you feel comfortable on the camera, the more people you register. It may take a while, but you can do it. Create content calendar YouTube subscribers are more likely to stay on YouTube subscriptions to upload videos on a regular & consistent basis instead of having less content and no new content uploaded in larger periods.  The best way to solve this problem is to create a content calendar for each month and notify the new uploaded and updated videos related to your external YouTube channel (End or last 10 seconds) of the videos upload your. This will create a feeling of anxiety among your audience and thus increase your chances of getting views and higher subscribers with each new upload. ",

            "answer_text": "No single way, but a number of steps you have to take each time you are making a video. I assume your goal is to earn money with YouTube. In this case, I would define five key characteristics that I noticed every successful YouTube channel has. The Message. Channel has to have a message that it wants to share. There should be a goal and a purpose to what you do and share there. Is your channel about photography? Your message might be that everybody can learn this following your easy tips. And your goal then might be to share your knowledge about photography, and also make it fun or present it in a aesthetically beautiful way. Are you making book reviews? Your message might be that not every book is worth reading or has some wisdom, intrinsic value to it. Your goal would be to review new or upcoming books and tell what fascinated you, what you learned, how it made your life better or how much fun you had.The Creed. That is a whole system of your believes. This is what makes you different or similar to brands. It takes a lot of work, but all big YouTube channels have their creed and, thus, brands. They become brands. And brands unite people around them and create communities (followers, zealots).The Tone. One day you are funny and gregarious, the other day you are nerdy or cheeky, and the other day you are depressed and gloomy. Unless you are doing a personal V-log, that\u2019s not what people would like to see. Unless that\u2019s is your character and people know that well, it\u2019s unlinkely too work. They want to know what to expect of you. Look at Peter McKinnon - always positive, lighthearted, playful. Or at Sean Tucker - serious, deep and thoughtful. And Thomas Heaton - kind, sincere and sometimes gawky. All three are photographers (and YouTubers) with distinct characters and tone.High quality. Of videos and the content. Gone are the days when you could just record a game that you play or a reviews of some product with free software or on your phone or an old camera. Shaky footage, bad lighting, resolution of less than 720p - avoid them! Content is the king, however. Do your research. What people need and want, and what there already is. How can you satisfy them in your own way? Great content always beats mediocre or even bad quality. If you create great content (what people want in a way that people like) in great quality - you will achieve success.Consistency. Of your message. In your upload frequency, in the tone and in the quality of videos. People stick to channels which content they can predict to some degree. Information should be new, but the structure of each and every video and of your channel should be the same.However, if you are not doing YouTube for money, then your passion will make you wanted on its own. It may time more time, but eventually your contagious interest will engage audiences and they will follow you despite other imperfections. And the money will come with them. P.S. Remember: Content>everything else. ",

            "answer_text": " Create an interesting trailer These trailers need to be short (30-60 seconds), attractive and most importantly they should give your visitors a reason to stay. Do they have to be funny, beautiful and emotional? It will definitely help you! What I really can not emphasize is the need for an effective call to action that gives the viewer a reason to sign up. Not only is the trailer of perfect length, it has to provoke emotional impulses, comedy and end up with a creative call to action. Name your video according to the strategy One of the hardest things is to name your video. You have a name in your head, but it can be something complicated or too long. My rule is to stay current and use YouTube's auto-complete feature to name your video. There is nothing wrong with your video having the same name or something that is close to the popular video, as long as the video is relevant. Registering is easy. It always amazes me when I go to a website and I have a lot of difficulty in learning how to sign up. Add a link to the top of the page, the footer, the sidebar of the site, at the bottom of the blog post, in the functionality bar, in the middle of the blog post, in the author profile, as a popup, under welcome bar, etc. (You do not have to do all of them, but make at least 4 different places and check which page is receiving the most registrations.) Add a dedicated page to sign up. Use your call-to-action Make sure you not only make a call to action to visit your website.  Instead, start by asking viewers to share videos only. You do not want to look too hard on the stock, but a simple request can make a big difference. Ask your users to share and build trust in your community. As you start to see your subscriber base grow, it's time to ask them to look at other content. If you've followed our first tip, you should have a steady video stream to introduce viewers.

People love to see the personal face and life of the channels they sign up for. That is one of the ways to be successful. Trying to find a good balance between what you want and what they want, my channel has a major problem when I start looking at the viewer's request for content. Share with your friends Share with your friends what you are working on and ask for a subscription if they are interested. Remember, do not keep bothering friends; They do not have to do anything. Get out on other social media platforms with some personal connections and let them know about your commitments. Ask them to like and sign up (if they are interested). Diversity is the spice of life I believe filming in many different locations can lead to more interest.  I understand that there may be no or you may have a set, but try to change a background or even use a green screen. Diversity is the spice of life to mix it with your wallpaper and place. Focus on your first 30 seconds Impressions in the first few seconds of video are essential. Businesses checking their ad content need to focus on gaining more points. Although many pre-roll video ads are geared toward getting users to view the entire ad before watching the content, there are still many ads with a minimum of five seconds of watch time. Grab the user's attention with an index or something to make them laugh - anything to keep them. Know what your target audience is looking for Analytics is always a reliable way to evaluate all your marketing efforts, to gather and make informed changes to your decisions. If you look at your search query data from YouTube, you'll see what viewers usually enter before clicking on your video. These are the terms that bring the largest number of viewers from internet searches. Engage with suppliers Besides the activities to improve the efficiency of your page, you can also try using some providers. It has a huge information system that can share customer information.

            "answer_text": "Give your video an irresistible title The title is the first thing a person will read when they find your video. If you want to know how to promote your YouTube channel, you need to be able to write compelling, interesting titles for each of your videos.  Write a descriptive title, attracting attention and attraction. Prioritize keywords in the first half of the title to provide clear insight on the video topic. But also try to share your enthusiasm for problems at hand. Your title limit is about 70 characters long. Google will cut anything longer than this in search results. Launch a video campaign  It is time to start setting up your ad. After logging in to AdWords, click on the red + CAMPAIGN and a menu will drop down where you can select the video option. Choose a name for the Campaign and then select True View format. The type of video ad you choose should be based on your marketing goals, so think deeply about your plan before continuing! The best time to post It all depends on the geographic location for your audience The most accurate time for your business will be unique to your personal business, regardless of what data says. You will want to check this yourself to see when your audience is really online. For example, if you target working professionals, they will have hours very different from those of college students until 3 am. Start a blog for your YouTube channel I recommend creating a blog with WordPress and using a WordPress-specific theme for videos. It's better for you when using Managed WordPress Hosting so you don't have to worry about blog maintenance. Open up about your life  If you want or have been a public figure, you should also be ready to take your life out there, not all, but probably most. Start a vlogging channel. Start a daily / weekly / monthly vlogging channel and update fans about your life. Or at least, regularly update your Snapchat. Put your heart on it. They are very addictive, getting lots of views, can get many new subscribers from it. ",

I don't recommend going any further, but no matter which schedule you choose, you want to stick to it, make sure it's on the banner so people can see it, and most importantly, talk. About it in your video. Share useful and valuable information You don't have to create long videos to share information, for example, with an explanation video, you can get a lot of information in less than 60 seconds.

Advertise your YouTube videos on other social channels  One of the great things about social media is that you can cross-promote content across different channels. Advertising your YouTube videos on your other social channels is the easiest way to increase your audience. Which channel are you on? Facebook, Linkedin, Instagram, Pinterest? There are many words to choose from.

This is perhaps the weirdest way to get subscribers, but it\u2019s out there.From people who support small streamers- you usually find these guys on Twitch via #smallstreamers or #supportsmallstreamer hash tags.By streaming in another language- I sometimes stream in Japanese or in English and on rare occasion, Korean. I sometimes play games in another language.By Skyrim, Borderlands, and Yakuza fans- I play a lot of the later two and at one point I got a bit of recognition for the Yakuza games as I would go through Kamurocho and break down what some of the signs and ads say. So you have to know your content to a degree.Through Quora- if someone actually wants to follow me, you can via step #1. That is not a fake Youtube ID. It is obviously based off my last name.

            "answer_text": "Knowing how to increase your YouTube subscribers is the secret to getting more views, therefore more money. If you can increase your subscribers, you will start to get the domino effect, which is where people see your channel has a lot of subscribers, so they sign up just because of that. If you have no subscribers, people will assume your channel is not very interesting since nobody is liking it - let's change that right now.  The Fastest Way To Increase Your YouTube Subscribers OK so, no one really wants to bother with strategies that require a whole lot of money or time, so here are some simple strategies you can implement immediately to increase your YouTube subscriber list exponentially. Just remember that if your videos are lacking- nothing will get you more subscribers unless they are super funny! 1. Interact With Your Audience. If you want to increase your YouTube subscribers, you have to be real. Sure, Rihanna has millions of views on her videos and she doesn't interact... Or does she? You listen to her music while you are in the shower - that counts as interacting. Seriously though, if you aren't providing music or some other form of passive entertainment, you need to interact with your audience. If you want to increase your YouTube subscribers on your channel and you do product reviews, information videos or tutorials, you need to help people through the comments, have a Facebook account set up and other ways to allow people to get in touch with you. This might seem like a lot of work at the start but it will pay off and you will begin to increase your YouTube subscribers. 2. Use Social Media. Using social media to increase your YouTube subscribers doesn't mean that you sit on Facebook all day and chat with your friends. It means things like submitting your videos to StumbleUpon, Digg, Reddit and Delicious. These places will bring real traffic to your site, but you need to take the time to give them the right keywords, put them in the right section and actually create accounts to start off with. Once you have the accounts set up it is easy to bookmark each video and increase your YouTube subscribers. 3. Annotate Your Videos. When somebody is watching a video, they can easily forget to subscribe even though they may love your stuff. Increase your YouTube subscribers add a call to action or CPA by annotating your videos and remind them to subscribe, comment or otherwise persuade them to join up. Also remember that annotations can be incredibly annoying and a lot of people close them, so a good strategy can be to have it pop up near the end, or just briefly pop up for a few seconds throughout the video. If it runs through the whole video your comment section will be full of people hating you! 4. Target Your Videos Properly. Write a great headline that people will actually want to search for. Chances are 1 in a million that you will produce something that just \"goes viral\", so you have to work hard to find out what words people will type into YouTuber Google to find your video. If you are writing a video about how to plumb up a toilet, you could title your video \"How To Plumb Up A Toilet - By A Registered Plumber\". Your headline is the first thing people will see, as well as the image you place beside it. You want to make sure that your headline and image (post thumbnail) say exactly what the video will be about, and you definitely want an image that is HD. This is the simplest way to increase your YouTube subscribers but often overlooked. 5. Hijack Other Video Traffic. It is your duty to jump onto competitors videos and hijack their thread! Well, not quite so brutally as that, however if you found a video that said \"How To Rip Out An Old Toilet\", you could add a comment to the thread that hints to your video-note that you're taking a chance with this one; it could be well received by the community or you could get booted off. If done correctly though, this could be a very fast way to increase your YouTube subscribers and can help out other viewers at the same time. 6. Ask Questions. Ask questions at the end of your video and get your viewers interested and curious. Encourage them to comment. This is a great way to increase your YouTube subscribers without any extra time spent after creating the video. Trying to get subscribers without communicating with them is like trying to get a loan without going to the bank and asking for one. You could ask users what struggles they are having in the niche you are targeting, what subjects they would like to see you tackle and what questions they have. 7. Post Video Responses To Other Videos. Using our example before about plumbing, if you see a video about how to install a toilet in a brand new house, you could do a video about fixing broken toilets. Try to think about the most common problems that people will have with toilets (or another niche) by talking to real people. Go on some forums in your niche and see what people are struggling with, this is the real way to increase your YouTube subscribers. If you can hone in on their needs, this is what they will type into the search engines and your video will come out on top if it is the best and most targeted. Increasing YouTube Subscribers Is Easy When You Know How To Do It Learning how to increase your YouTube subscribers is like learning anything else - commit to learning and then implement. There are no doubt plenty of ways to increase your YouTube subscribers, but some ways will work better for different niches. Depending on the niche you are attempting to target, you may have to try a combination of several things, however, don't try to do too many strategies all at once. Take the time to think about what skills you have and where your time is best spent. If you are a slow typer, it may be better to hire somebody else to post comments on other threads of competitors. One thing to always remember when trying to increase your YouTube subscribers is that if your videos are great, people will tell their friends about them and you will increase your YouTube subscribers with very little effort. This is the ideal situation for you. Some things to remember are to always record in HD, keyword and title your videos appropriately, be a bit of a character, be an expert (or learn just a little more than the average journeyman) and try to make people enjoy watching the video. If you can do this you will increase your YouTube subscribers a lot faster than your competitors with poor videos. Are You Losing Money trying to Get Leads for your business?

            "answer_text": "If you are starting a new YouTube channel, I am assuming you definitely have an account on social media platforms. Only \u201cassuming\u201d. If you are not active on social media, refer to part B. The first step is to link all your social media. Linking is a powerful tool. Put up the link to you your YouTube channel on all these platforms. Instagram does have a website section in Bio where you can put up links. Then come facebook, Twitter and quora (I know it is not exactly a social media platform, but does the work).The second and the most important step is to pester everyone you know\u2026 like even your acquaintances, the girl who pulled your ear in the kindergarten, the classmate who stole your pencil during lunch time in the third grade or someone who hated you in college. Just anyone. Ask your family relatives, they would have no escape. Text them to like, subscribe and na na na. Don't ask them to share. It'll just repel them. (And they might end up not even liking or subscribing let alone be sharing.) Cuz why would they? What are you going to do if they sit and share those links. So share share and share. This will give you the initial hundreds followers.Now you have the starting hundreds followers, how to reach the thousand mark? That's tricky and whenever you Google or Quora, people are going to tell you to add the appropriate title to your YouTube video or to add tags so that you rank higher than your competitors. Which one does exactly work? I don't know man. I am trying to find the answer. If you are reading this, please like and subscribe my channel. And if you find the answer, please let me know too.\ud83d\ude4f I dance and post those videos. So this is how you beg in style. Thanks for reading the worthless post. PART B: If you don't have social media, how are you going to publicize your YouTube content? Just write letters! Never too late to restart the trend. Ofcourse not! ",

            "answer_text": "From my experience, gaining subscribers is not any easy task. I have a YouTube channel too (http://www.youtube.com/TheCoolKid19) but in the start I was NOTHING, literally. Basically what you need to is listed below: Always remember that you should have some idea before making any video. You cannot make any video until you actually know what you are making on. For example, I am good in hacking and making viruses so I make videos on the same. Similarly let's suppose that you're good in gaming then make gaming videos.Next is the equipment. So you have the idea in your mind but now you have to make videos. But\u2026 How? So basically you require resources. Once you have the idea, make a short script of your video (except if you are making a gaming or reaction video) and just learn it quickly. Now if you don't want to speak in the video that's easier. Also, you require an editing software, screen recorder software (if you make pc screen videos), camera, etc.Also you will have to post videos as soon as possible but not too fast. And the video should be interesting and eye catching.Next, add a catchy thumbnail. Thumbnail is what attracts 90% of the people. So thumbnail must be really good and eye catching.Similarly, there should be good tags in the video. If you are not able to think of tags yourself, you can use websites such as Rapidtags YouTube Tag Generator and Optimizer.I hope these tricks would help you a lot. I have currently 430+ subscribers. These helped me. And they'll help you too. If you have any questions, you can ask me. ",

            "answer_text": "These are some basic tips that you can use to increase or grow your YouTube Subscribers. Ask your viewers to Subscribe - The easiest way to start increasing your subscriber count is to start asking for it in your videos itself. Don\u2019t assume that this is automatic and viewers will always Subscribe. In your videos, give your viewers a compelling call to action and ask them to click the \u201cSubscribe\u201d button right above your video.2. Engage and Interact - Please keep in mind that YouTube is a community, not just a place to host your videos. You will start to see positive more results when you interact with the other members of this community. One of the best ways to build a following of subscribers is to support others in their YouTube marketing efforts. Comment, like and subscribe as frequently as possible to other content creators and influencers on YouTube, and wait for the results. It\u2019s a simple concept, really: the more you give, the more you get. 3. Featured Channels - Another easy method for expanding your reach and getting more subscribers is to strategically partner with other YouTube content creators or influencers. On your YouTube channel page there is an option to add other \u201cFeatured Channels\u201d of those \u201cYouTubers\u201d you like and recommend. When you get other channels that have a similar audience to feature you, you can expect to see new viewers coming your way very quickly. Smart right? Keep in mind that these are just the basic, it could maybe get you a few and even a hundred, but If you want a more advanced tips you may want to check this Blog that I always read. Their tips and suggestions really works so make sure to check them out. ",

            "answer_text": "   \u2022 You need to make your video(s) amazing \u2022 Give it a perfect title with appropriate tags and description \u2022 Make it more creative \u2022 Share your videos wisely \u2022 Use annotations \u2022 Increasing the views by buying real viewers \u2022 For your convenience and better understanding, these tips are explained in detail. STEP 1: CAPTIVATING TITLE VIDEO TITLE MATTERS A LOT After making a video and before uploading it on the site, you need to name it appropriately. This means, the name or title should precisely tell what is inside. Also, it should be short, engaging, and to the point. For example, if your video is on how to prepare yummy Red Sauce Pasta at home in an easier manner? Its title should specifically be \u2018Delectable Red Sauce Pasta\u2019. This helps viewers in searching the video(s) easily. A catchy and short title helps in easy search of the video and also facilitates viewers to opt for your video over another. Usage of the thumbnail also helps in making your video(s) more fascinating and influencing viewers to view and like it. One should always prefer to choose a thumbnail that is visually engaging, and effectively signifies what viewers are going to view after accessing the video. STEP 2 : APPROPRIATE DESCRIPTION AND TAGS OF THE VIDEO Another notable thing is that one should describe his/her video(s) thoroughly to increase the number of views. The description of the video should be accurate, precise and captivating. In simple terms, we can say that the description of the video should be what people exactly want. After description, another important thing that makes your video(s) easily accessible for other people is the usage of Tags. DESCRIPTION MUST HAVE KEYWORDS Tags exactly notify whether your video is relevant in terms of what viewers looking for as well as help in deciding which video should come-up on top in Google\u2019s Video Search results. So, at the time of preparing a list of tags for your video(s), ensure that you are using all possible keywords from the title and description in the \u201ctags\u201d section to elevate viewer\u2019s interest. The more relevant tags you use for your video, more frequently it will flash on the search results. If you Buy YouTube Views from us, we promote it on our very established network that gets you real and authentic followers. We have millions of fans on social media and by promoting your video there, we get views and comments. For example \u2013 if you are uploading a funny video of cute babies of dogs, you can use words like Cute, Dog and Funny, for tags. In addition, if your video is in reference to the themes from the news, popular culture or other artists, you also need to ensure that they are also in your tag list. STEP 3: ASTUTE SHARING OF YOUR VIDEO DO NOT FORGET TO SHARE YOUR VIDEOS As soon as you upload your video on YouTube, you should start sharing it with as many people as you can. The more quickly you share it with maximum number of people, more is the possibility that your video will become a YouTube hit. Delay in sharing of video(s) will lead to reduced number of views, and increase in possibility that people of YouTube community will forgot it soon. You can also share your videos using social networking sites like Facebook, twitter, etc. When you buy views from us, we do that for you and share your video on our network and promote your video on YouTube through our marketing strategies. You can also email your video to your friends, friends of friend, fellow workers and family members to make it popular and to increase the number of views. The subject of the email should be fascinating and the content should be convincing. This increases the chances that people will watch your video, even without knowing you personally. In addition, you can promote your video posted on YouTube by using a blog or a website of your own or of your friends. STEP 4: PROPER EDITING OF THE VIDEO EDITING MAKES YOUR VIDEO LOOK GOOD To hold attention of the viewers, it is required that the uploaded video should be edited properly. There should not be long pauses and distractions in the video. As an advantage over it, you can also add text information like email address, website and more, to the video. But, if you are not ready to upload the video on YouTube, do not make it live. Reason being, YouTube gives priority to fresh content; so if you make any major change in the uploaded video, it will lose its initial momentum. Therefore, it is advisable that before you make your video live on the site, check its content and other related aspects thoroughly. Use ADOBE AFTER EFFECTS ore any other good video editing software. STEP 5: USING ANNOTATIONS Yet another staggering way to increase the YouTube views is the use of Annotations. These annotations are the valuable marketing tool, offered by YouTube. By using annotation, you can either link one video to another or can link a video to your playlists or channels. It helps viewers by asking them to link to a different yet similar video, if they like the one they are watching. If you are not using proper and effective annotations, you are missing out on some superb prospects to increase number of views for your uploaded video(s). You can even use annotation as plain text, which can relate to further details or links within your video description. STEP 6: GETTING MORE SUBSCRIBERS Adding to the list of useful ways, here is one more for you. Getting subscribers for your video(s) is an outstanding and guaranteed way to get more viewers. If someone subscribes you, he/she will view all your newly uploaded videos on his/her homepage. In order to increase the number of subscribers, you can directly ask people to subscribe you at the end of the uploaded video along with the annotation. To increase the number of YouTube views, you can ask the viewers to like or share your video(s). ",

            "answer_text": "There are some strategies to work your YouTube channel out for better performance and getting more subscribers: Strategy #1 Work on your YouTube video metadata Metadata is a combination of title, description, tags, thumbnails, and caption of videos on YouTube, which helps users to find through the search bar. Once you entered your YouTube channel, click on the camera icon on the top right side, and while uploading a video, you can fill in the blank.  Choose the best titleVideo title will be shown just under the video on YouTube. If you are working on a specific topic, it is better to find the search terms, or words first. For example, you are uploading a video about creating an automatic table of content in Microsoft Word. So, you should know how people would search this on YouTube first. If you search you would see that people are more looking to get the answer of this question: \u201chow to create a table of content in Microsoft word?\u201d this title would straightly talk about your content. Content accordance with titleKeep in mind that people first would see the title and thumbnails, then they click on the video to see if this is the content they want. If you write something different or not similar to your content, people won\u2019t stay on your video, and they would be interested in watching the video. It would ruin your channel reputation, and also the audience retention (the percentage of watching a video by a single user). So, try to choose the simple, straightforward, and eye-catchy title all at the same time, and keep its thumbnails eye-catching and attractive. video description on YouTubeThe same as the title, video descriptions also help users to find your video on YouTube. The story can give more information to others about your video; it can be the lyrics of a song (which might people search), or any other words and terms which might people look for on YouTube. Thus, optimize your search by adding a complete and detailed description of your videos. Video tagsTags are words that users type in search bar to find particular videos. These words are also used to categorize videos. Use the relevant keywords and those you had used in the title and description. This action will increase the chance your videos be on the first page of YouTube search, and getting more views. Strategy # 2 increase your user engagement All you need is more engagements and keep user stay on your channel and watching the videos. Therefore, you should look for ways to increase engagement and more views. More engagementsEngagements include like, subscribing the channel, share the video, and comments. All these together help you to reach your goal. So, try to give a \u201cso what?\u201d answer in the first 10 seconds of your video, and also motivating viewers to comment, subscribe, and share your videos. Audience retentionThe second thing you need is to attract users to watch your videos and keep them watching your videos. The percentage of the video that every user watch is called audience retention. High viewer retention scores will increase the visibility of a video on YouTube and also appearing in the YouTube suggest bar. This action will lead to more views and engagements, which is the ultimate goal of sharing videos on YouTube. Strategy #3 add transcription to your YouTube video Adding transcript to your video brings you lots of benefits including providing search engines a great bunch of keywords, make it accessible for disabled people, and also increase the user experience (ease of watching and understanding the video content). There are several tutorials on YouTube itself, which shows you how to make YouTube transcripts and upload them correctly. Conclusion If you are looking forward to coming in the search results of YouTube or its suggestion bar, you should work on your metadata (title, tags, description, thumbnails). Use other strategies such as adding transcriptions to the videos, or focusing on getting more engagements and audience retention (the percentages of watching the whole video).

            "answer_text": "Video content is leading the way in the content marketing scene (as of 2017). YouTube is currently the leading platform for video blogging (vlogging), video sharing, and video marketing. It is a free platform offered by Google, and many (including me) love it. Facebook and Twitter have recently stepped into the video marketing game, but they still fall way short of having the kind of impact that YouTube has. Popular: How To Start Making Money from YouTube using FamebitIf you currently have a YouTube channel, you must be wondering how you can get more YouTube subscribers, and how you can increase the reach of your YouTube videos.  With over a billion unique YouTube visitors per month, there is a large potential audience for every uploaded video. Whether it\u2019s a video of someone performing a prank or a video of a fashionista\u2019s summerwear review, YouTube is the go-to platform for video consumption. With a whole new lot of YouTube stars on the rise, it is definitely a platform to be considered by everyone looking for some online marketing and publicity. YouTube is a great platform for bloggers to broaden their internet reach by making a personal connection with their followers. The possibility for a blogger to leverage this social media giant and drive huge traffic from YouTube is high. To do that, one first needs to get more subscribers. Note: This detailed guide to getting YouTube subscribers is long. Make sure you have enough time now to read it, or you can always bookmark it and read it later! 20 Smart Ways To Get More YouTube Subscribers in 2017 Another year has gone by and your resolution to re-build that YouTube channel of yours has not been accomplished. If you are thinking about revamping your YouTube channel, here are 20 smart ways to gain more YouTube subscribers in 2017. I recently had the opportunity to attend a YouTube fan-fest with a VIP invitee (thanks to my wonderful acquaintances), and a little interaction with them will shed some light on how these things work out. I have another associate (a student of mine) who saw a tremendous amount of growth in his YouTube subscribers and viewers within a span of two years. Although his numbers might not be outrageous, they total well above a million views, which more than justifies his efforts. All that said, correctly implementing these techniques will surely help you achieve your goals. 1. Create a plan (and script) for your videos.  \u201cHe who fails to plan is planning to fail.\u201c \u2013 Sir Winston Churchill The first step in getting started on your YouTube journey is to plan what your channel is going to be all about. Then you need to plan the structure of the videos. Decide what it is that you love creating and focus on developing related skills. Do not mimic trending YouTube channels. Doing what you love is more important for success on YouTube (and in life). Videos tend to perform better if you write a script because scripts help you in organizing your videos efficiently and keeping you on track. By sticking to a script, you\u2019ll be able to stay on track without veering off to an unrelated topic. This script will also ensure a perfect flow of events resulting in a well-focused video. Include as many details as possible into your video script: The exact words you are going to say.The actions you will be taking in the video.The main points you need to stress.Any necessary calls to action (click on this link, subscribe to my channel, etc.)Also, identify your target audience and write your script based off of their understanding. Are they technically savvy? Are they non-native English speakers? Are they smart or dumb? What are their levels of expertise in relation to yours? Do they want something funny or informative? Identify who your audience is and use appropriate language. 2. Produce highly engaging content (obviously).  It should go without saying, but you need to create content that is engaging, informative, and entertaining. Make sure it stays that way for the entire duration of the video. Losing the hook in the middle will cost you a lot of viewers. Content that works the best is content that is either entertaining or informative. The content that really works the best is content that is entertaining AND informative. This is pretty standard with any kind of content marketing, but in particular, videos that inform and entertain are usually the most successful. Specifically, you should be uploading a combination of burst and evergreen videos. Burst videos will be all the rage for a limited time, getting you instant hits, but will fade away as time passes by. Evergreen videos are the ones that will get you archived views and will remain relevant irrespective of time. Ideally, if possible, you should try to create mostly evergreen content. If you fear the wrath of the camera, you can try publishing \u2018Screencasts\u2018. You can still make screencasts entertaining and informative. Whatever you do, before you hit the publish button, make sure your videos are highly engaging and will be of value to your audience. 3. Increase your uploading frequency.  Now this is easier said than done, but you cannot ignore its validity. The main reason someone subscribes to a channel is because they love the work of the publisher and wants to see more of their videos. YouTube subscribers usually do not like channels that don\u2019t produce regular content. Especially in today\u2019s digital age, consumers want continually more and more entertainment. You need to be able to keep up with your subscribers\u2019 demands. Consistency is the key to developing a long-lasting relationship with your subscribers. Release your videos in a timely, recurring, and structured fashion. Try to publish one video per week\u2026 or at least one or two per month. Stick to your schedule and do not upload videos off of this schedule. This will hurt your reputation. It\u2019s like watching your favorite TV series; a new episode comes out according to a regular schedule. This consistency helps you stay engaged as a viewer. 4. Learn how to optimize your titles. Being distinguishable is the most important aspect of YouTube success. One great way to do this is to give your videos offbeat names. This way, you\u2019re going to be getting a lot of people coming to your channel based on curiosity alone. Having quirky titles will play a major role in getting the views that your channel needs to benefit from the social proof factor. But to get a maximum amount of views, you will also need to dive into the SEO part of YouTube marketing. Here are a few tips for optimizing your YouTube titles for greater reach: Use the keyword in the title. This had a larger impact on SEO in the past, but it still has a pretty large effect on video. Google crawlers don\u2019t watch videos the way they read blog posts, so putting the keyword in the title will let Google bots know what your video is all about.Use Google Adwords to identify what people are searching for on the web. Try to tackle videos with a perfect blend of high volume searches and low competition.Don\u2019t make the title too long. Google truncates the length of the video down to 66 characters and adds \u2018YouTube |\u2019 before the video (taking an extra 10 characters). Your ideal video title should be no more than 50 characters.Make the title descriptive. Give the audience a sneak peek as to what the video will be about.Make the title engaging. Like I said above, having a quirky title will get more people to click. The more clicks you have, the higher it will rank.Don\u2019t use the word \u201cvideo\u201d in the title. This will only take up space and won\u2019t help you rank higher on YouTube\u2019s search engine (though it may have an effect on normal search engines).In short, learn how to write catchy, relevant, and optimized titles. 5. Make the most of channel customizations.  If you are going to get visitors to trust your brand on YouTube, you have to make the most of the customization options that YouTube has to offer. Make yourself appear professional, and viewers will be sure to respect and trust you. If you already run a blog with a bit of a following, make use of similar branding elements for your YouTube channel. This will make you easily recognizable across all platforms. Having some well-crafted, custom channel art for YouTube will help you establish yourself as a brand. You can use this pretty cheap (Only $19) YouTube channel art service which lets you create your own optimized YouTube channel art. Use a custom background header that includes some design elements from your blog. Make the most of the YouTube channel bio and custom URL to finish up your channel customizations. Keep the bio short and to the point. You can always link to your blog\u2019s URL in the video description for a more detailed bio. 6. Personalize video thumbnails.  Here is something many YouTube creators agree upon. Create a custom video thumbnail for each video instead of letting one be randomly generated. This only makes sense. Using annotations and relevant images as custom thumbnails for your YouTube videos will increase your videos\u2019 CTR (click through rate). A custom video thumbnail with a minor annotation will tell your users what your video is all about. YouTube currently offers a selection of thumbnails from three intervals \u2013 at the 1/4th mark, at 1/2 mark, and at the 3/4th mark. Choose the one that best illustrates what your video is about. 7. Create an engaging channel trailer. Subscribe on Youtube YouTube offers a great feature called channel trailers that lets you automatically play a video upon the opening of a YouTube channel. Your channel trailer is something you must carefully work on and constantly improve to keep visitors engaged. This is the moment where you need to catch your audience\u2019s attention within a few seconds. The perfect channel trailer is somewhere between 30 seconds to 60 seconds. Here you will need to provide a reason to your potential subscribers as to why they must stay on your channel, and what it is that you have to offer them. If you are good in front of the camera, give a quick, informative, and engaging introduction (with a well-structured script). In your YouTube\u2019s Channel Reports, check the viewer retention rates to see if you are killing off potential subscribers with a boring or lengthy channel trailer. Tweak it until it\u2019s perfect. 8. Make use of \u2018Call to Action\u2019 annotations.  \u2018Call to action\u2019 annotations are those annoying popups in the video (which can be a blessing for the YouTube creators). If used in a proper way, you can get more subscribers by making your visitors click them during the video. Many YouTubers have reported increased channel subscriptions with these annotations added to their videos. A simple link created for subscribing to the channel can be placed as a call to action in your video. If you\u2019re using a graphic to add a call to action, you can liven it up with a call to action annotation. If done in an unobtrusive way, you will see your channel subscriptions grow. But again, the key here is not to be annoying. Users will not subscribe if your only reason for making videos is to get more people to subscribe. Do it smartly, and it will pay off. 9. Use the right tools.  There are a lot of great tools out there. From tools to help you make videos to tools to help you promote your videos, using the right tools will help you increase your organic viewership. And the more organic views you have, the more potential subscribers you can get. For me, I have been using TubeBuddy for a while & I highly recommend it to anyone who is serious about YouTube marketing. Check out my TubeBuddy review.TubeBuddy will help you find more viewers, make more money, and automate your entire YouTube process. Definitely check it out. Get TubeBuddy Account Check out this video on how TubeBuddy can help: Subscribe on Youtube More YouTube tools: YouTube Capture for iPhone/iPadTechCrunch- Super Chat: Make Money with Live StreamsFamebit (To get sponsorship for your YouTube videos)10. Let people find you.  YouTube provides an option to link to your official web page, and if you\u2019ve got one, make sure you do it. This makes sense, and there\u2019s no reason for you not doing it. The efforts you put into getting visitors for your YouTube channel can be capitalized on when you direct your most curious visitors to your website. Moreover, your channel will also become verified as an authentic representation of your brand on YouTube. Under the channel settings of your YouTube page, add your website/blog URL to your channel. You may also consider adding your website/blog URL in the channel description itself. Similarly, add a \u2018Subscribe\u2019 button somewhere on your blog to drive more subscribers to your YouTube channel. Read: How To Add YouTube Subscribe Button On Your Blog 11. Limit the videos to under 5 minutes.  Source: Buffer blog- The Ideal Length of Everything OnlineAlthough YouTube is home to many detailed, in-depth reviews and other such lengthy content, the high converting videos are the ones which are optimized for less than 5 minutes in length. Comscore reported in January 2014 that the average length of most YouTube videos was around 4.4 minutes. For content creators who are getting started, this is the golden number. Follow this number until a following is built. Once you have a good following, you can experiment with video length and see what your audience\u2019s reaction is. Keep it short, simple, informative, entertaining, and under 5 minutes. It is a tough challenge, but it\u2019s worth your efforts. 12. Use A YouTube Intro & Outro. Your YouTube intro and outro not only helps in branding, it will make your video more entertaining. Having an intro and outro will serve your brand and offer your video a sense of professionalism. It\u2019s like the opening theme song of a TV show. Moreover, an attractive intro will ensure that your viewers stay glued to the rest of the video. Here is an example from my channel: Subscribe on Youtube Check out how you can get one of these for your YouTube channel. Get Your YouTube Intro on Fiverr 13. Edit your videos ruthlessly.  Thomas Hawk, a well-renowned photographer, claims that for every single photograph that he publishes, he has ten rejected shots. The same goes with any type of editing. Ruthlessly edit your YouTube videos and make sure only your best ones get published. If you make haste about strictly adhering to your schedule and publish haphazardly, it will only hurt you and your brand as a whole. Make a lot of recordings while you are shooting a video, and make sure only the best parts get selected. Take multiple shots if you don\u2019t feel confident about a certain take. Although I haven\u2019t done much video editing on a Macintosh, Adobe Premier will work perfectly if you are based on Windows. Get the right editing tools to assist you in this (often) painstaking process. If are willing to invest more time and effort to understanding cinematography, I recommend you check out The Five C\u2019s of Cinematography: Essential tips for film making. It has some great cutting-edge techniques for both the novice and the seasoned cinematographer. How To Edit A Video On YouTube14. Optimize your video descriptions.  Coming back to the SEO aspect of YouTube videos, the video description is not to be neglected. The description will not only let your videos be found in search engines, they\u2019ll also give potential viewers an idea of what your video is about. But don\u2019t overdo it. Having a very detailed description makes no sense because only the first few lines of your description show up when the video is initially loaded. Again, like the title, you should use your keyword in the description, and again, don\u2019t overdo it. Don\u2019t think you\u2019re outsmarting the search engine by adding in your keyword 17 times. Doing this will actually hurt your chances of showing up in searches. Keep it natural and authentic. Hint: You can try linking people to a \u2018squeeze page\u2019 in your video description. 15. Make the most of meta tags.  Make use of the Google Keyword Planner for getting ideas on relevant keywords for your YouTube videos. Add all of those relevant keywords to your videos. This will help you become more discoverable in both Google and YouTube search engines. Overdoing keywords will not help (it will actually hurt), but a few well-researched and well-placed keywords can do wonders for your rankings. A low video count may not always be only about poor content; it could also indicate poor discoverability Metadata is something that plays a major role in getting your videos displayed in search results. You can browse some well-converting videos and see what meta tags they are using to give you some ideas. But don\u2019t just copy and paste meta tags; this won\u2019t help your cause. Here\u2019s a video guide to help you out: Subscribe on Youtube 16. End your videos on a high note. Whatever the nature of your videos, make sure you end your videos on a high note. Just like the last dialogue before the curtain falls, make sure you end your videos in a memorable fashion. Ask your audience for a subscription and a like if they liked the video. Tell them to check out your website. Give them your phone number and ask them to call you (\u2026I wouldn\u2019t recommend that one). Whatever you do, remember: If you never ask, the answer will always be no.End your videos on a note of confidence and let your audience know that you appreciate their viewership. Create a tail slate, or a brand-like outro with a standard banner and \u201csubscribe\u201d annotations across all of your videos. End your videos with a smile and keep your visitors eager for more. 17. Consider collaborating with fellow YouTubers.  Collaborating on YouTube has become pretty common recently among top content creators. Why? Because collaboration benefits everyone.It\u2019ll be good for you, for your collaborators, and for the audience. The creative process is a constructive one, and seeing other YouTubers as your competitors will only impede your progress, leaving you languishing and loathing others\u2019 successes. Try to reach out to similar users in your field and ask them out for an opportunity to work together on something interesting. You\u2019ll be able to connect to a new audience, your collaborator will be able to connect to a new audience, and your viewers will love all of this extra value they\u2019re getting. It\u2019s a win-win-win. 18. Interact with your loyal fan base. Social media is built upon this intangible thread of connecting and interacting with fellow people. It is all about how much you care.When your fans know that you care about them, they will care about you. Interact with your audience, and listen to their requests in the comments section of your videos. It is true that you may face certain backlashes and anger in your comments section, but brush it off with elegance and listen to your loyal fan base. Reply to the comments under your videos, and make your viewers feel connected all the time. This will build trust, and they will respect you for caring about them. 19. Consider giveaways and video challenges.  Who doesn\u2019t love giveaways? Offer your audience something in return for all of their engagement on your YouTube channel. A free giveaway or video contest will reward your current followers, and will help lure in new followers. You can give away anything you want: A new tech gadget.A branded t-shirt.A hosting subscription.A new car\u2026!Whatever it is, your audience will love the chance at getting something for free, and they will tell all of their friends about it (especially if the prize is really good). This is not only free promotion, it\u2019s free viral promotion. For a really big giveaway, many YouTube hosts require users to follow all of their social media profiles to enter into the contest. I recommend this approach. It\u2019s best if the thing you\u2019re giving away is related to your niche, but even if it\u2019s not, your audience will still love getting something for free. 20. Cross-platform promotion is a necessity.  In this age of social media, being present and active on multiple social platforms is a pre-requisite for being alive. If you\u2019re trying to build a brand, being discoverable is a must. You need to be active on many major social media platforms. You should at least have a profile on Facebook, Twitter, and Google Plus. But you can always opt for other ones like Pinterest, Instagram, SnapChat, and all of the others\u2026 If being on too many social media platforms sounds like a logistical nightmare, you can use an auto-scheduling app like Buffer to help you stay organized and on a regular posting schedule. You can also try Facebook Ads and Google Ads to promote yourself further on the web (I\u2019d recommend trying Facebook Ads before Google Ads). You can also try tools like Pay with a tweet that lets users pay for a product with a tweet. This is how successful brands are built. By being visible on many places around the web, you set yourself up as an omniscient presence. Bonus Tip: Hustle for your first 1000 YouTube subscribers. Whatever you do, have an aggressive strategy to get out there and get your first 1000 subscribers as quickly as possible. The \u2018build it, they\u2019ll come\u2019 attitude won\u2019t work on social media. You will need to promote your channel to your maximum abilities. A channel that\u2019s quickly gaining buzz will also help you stay motivated to work even harder and create better videos for your audience. Share with your friends what you\u2019ve been working on, and ask for a subscription if they are interested. Remember, don\u2019t keep pestering friends; they are not obliged to do anything. Get out there on other social media platforms with some personal connections and let them know about your undertakings. Ask them for likes and subscriptions (if they\u2019re interested). Again, don\u2019t pester anyone! Conclusion: Keep experimenting and exploring \u201cOnly those who attempt the absurd will achieve the impossible.\u201d \u2014 M. C. Escher What worked for someone else might not turn out to work for you. So, keep experimenting and stick to the methods that work\u2026 for you. Keep experimenting with camera angles, backgrounds, video thumbnails, and all of the techniques in this article. Keep tracking your changes and the way they are affecting your audience\u2019s behavior. Stay true to your brand. Building something of value on YouTube takes a lot of effort, time, perseverance, and a long-term commitment. But eventually, with patience, you can reap its benefits. ",

            "answer_text": "Create a release schedule and talk about it in your weekly YouTube videos When you go to any YouTube channel, you\u2019ll see that every channel has a banner, and you want to make sure, if you\u2019re going to be releasing one video a week, make sure you choose a day of the week that you release it. Specifically ask your viewers to subscribe and be part of the \u201cFounders Club\u201d The Founders Club can be however it is that you decide to define it. Maybe it\u2019s the first 100 subscribers, or perhaps it\u2019s the first 1,000 subscribers Ultimately, when you build a channel, you build a brand. It\u2019s not about you, the creator, it\u2019s not even about the channel, it\u2019s about the subscribers and the conversation you have with them after every video is released. So invite them to be a part of that Founders Club. Monitor your YouTube analytics to see which videos will get you your first 100 subscribers In your YouTube analytics, you can see which videos are producing the most number of subscribers, and once you can see which types of videos are bringing you in subscribers, just keep making more videos just like that. Listen to your audience by watching your YouTube analytics. If they\u2019re subscribing, make more videos that fit that theme. Make sure you add a YouTube Auto Subscribe Link in the description of your video I have a client who\u2019s used this technique to increase the number of subscribers by 40 percent in the past month. I\u2019ll leave a link for this particular channel so you can be able to see exactly how it works, and if you want, you can just copy and paste it, and put it on all of your videos. ",

            "answer_text": "If you have just started your YouTube channel and you are just a beginner looking for tips and guides on how to grow your YouTube channel from a scratch, I have listed 15 SUPER-USEFUL tricks down below which will help you in your endeavour to become a successful YouTuber.These are the tricks that am using for the past 3 years or so and are based on my personal experience. They really help a lot if followed correctly. Upload videos on a regular basis, in my opinion, upload videos once or twice a week.Maintain your video uploading consistency.Try to make a particular day each week when you shall upload your videos, in this way your audience knows when will you upload a fresh video and might even wait for it.Always upload original content, be it good or bad, cause you will definitely improve over time. Posting other\u2019s content again or making a video regarding other\u2019s content won\u2019t help you much in achieving what you desire.Never use CLICKBAIT.Clickbait is the technique in which you make your thumbnail and title totally different from the content of your video so as to misguide your audience.This method might work for a couple of time but in the long run, it will do you more harm than good.COLLABORATE with other YouTubers.Collaborating with YouTubers of your age, or that who live near you or those who upload the same content as you do will increase the traffic on your channel, thus resulting in its exposure and increasing subscribers.Always drop a positive comment on other YouTubers videosEither they know you or not always leave a good feedback.When you leave a comment, people who view comments will also read your comment and will get to know your name and learn your existence.Gradually, you shall start gaining more subscriber.During your video, always ask your viewers to drop a like, a feedback/comment and subscribe to your channel.I know that this is a super-old trick, but it works just fine with me.It makes your audience aware of the act.Value your audience interests, opinions and their suggestions.When someone comments on your video then be sure to like their comment and sometimes even drop a \u2018Heart\u2019 on their comment.The audience really likes that !!Try to make attractive and smart thumbnails for your YouTube videos.Most people tend to see thumbnails only and do not pay any attention to the title of the video.When someone from your audience comments on your video, be polite enough to reply to them saying Thanks or something like that.Try to make videos related to the topic i.e. the title and thumbnail, never go astray from the topic of your video.For example, your video is about something and you are talking about something else in the whole video.Try to become more active socially.Make accounts on social websites such as Instagram, Twitter or even a Facebook page at which your audience can talk and interact with you, asking you their queries and even suggesting ideas and content for your new videos.Promote your stuff and videos on the web.You can use your social handles for this purpose.Conduct giveaways and shoutouts or make Thanking-You videos for your audience after every milestone set by you is achieved.Make an attractive channel art/banner for your YouTube channel.To learn how to make a SUPER-DOPE channel art, watch the video provided below \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014I hope you are answered !!!

            "answer_text": "Why Collaborate? The prospect of gaining new followers is what motivates many content creators to collaborate with one another. Working with another YouTuber is a great way to introduce your channel to a whole new fanbase. If you choose your collaborator well, you\u2019re targeting viewers who should already be interested in the types of videos you make. What\u2019s more, collaborating with other YouTubers is a great way to push yourself to be more creative by giving you fresh content ideas. Launching A Successful YouTube Collaboration To a new YouTuber, the idea of collaborating with others can be daunting. It\u2019s natural for you to be a bit hesitant at first but once you get started, you\u2019ll see that the process moves along a lot easier than you initially thought. 1. Finding The Right People To Collaborate With There are millions of YouTubers out there so finding the right person to collaborate with shouldn\u2019t be that hard \u2014 as long as you manage to cut through the noise and find the right people.} 2. Reaching Out Once you\u2019re happy with your list of potential collaborators, you can begin reaching out to them one by one. The best way to reach out to a potential collaborator is through email and/or social media. A YouTuber that\u2019s keen on collaborating with others \u2014 be it brands or fellow content creators \u2014 should have their business email listed on their channel along with their social media handles. 3. Creating Collab Videos After sending a bunch of proposals to a bunch of YouTubers, you\u2019re bound to receive a few responses. Once someone agrees to collaborate with you, you can begin working on video ideas. You can take inspiration from YouTube (where else?) to get your creative juices flowing. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many ways you can get more YouTube subscribers, here are some of my ways: 1. If you want that your subs keep up with you, you have to upload videos at least, twice a week. When you keep updating your subs what's going on in your life, they will want to keep catch up with you. 2. Promote your videos on other platforms aka- social media. Promote on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Tumbler that you have a YouTube channel. That way you could get to many people that didn't know that you have a YouTube channel. 3. Be in touch with your subs. Ask them to comment if they like your videos, or what they want to see in your next videos. 4. Buy them. A lot of YouTubers that want to success, buy subs. It raises the subs number very fast and helps you look very successful in less time. But, you have to be sure that your subs are real and not bots, otherwise, they will drop fast and YouTube can act against your channel. 5. Collaboration. Do a collaboration with other YouTubers that you know, it will expose you to new subs. When I opened my channel, I did all those ways, promote my videos on social media, upload videos twice a week, collab with my friends and bought subs (GetFans was my provider and their services were really good, and I mean- real subs). All those ways improved my social proof and it really helped me gain new subs. ",

            "answer_text": " Create a playlist Video playlists separate your videos to make the video more consumer-friendly for first-time visitors. Another advantage of playlists is that people can switch to more videos after watching the first video. Create a list of subcategories of people who watch your channel and cater to each group. This kind of personalization is essential in making people sign up. Customized human thumbnail The best way to ensure people playing your video is by using the image of a person who is laughing directly with eye contact as a thumbnail for your video. Your video thumbnail is essentially the cover of your video, so you need it completely beyond the appeal. Actually, I think video thumbnails are the most important thing that determines whether visitors are playing or not playing your video. Co-marketing YouTube is a great avenue to co-brand your brand with another company. Co-marketing has become a helpful strategy for many businesses trying to increase the number of viewers and subscribers to YouTube. Partnering with big-name brands has a tremendous growth privilege. However, you can not just hit Target and video marketing requirements. Be yourself People may like to consume your content because you are humorous, intelligent, witty, humble, generous, kind or foolish. Insert any qualities you have here. If you have created previous videos for your online courses, go back and see them. Focus on maintaining consistency with everything you release for public consumption. Ask your friends and your network to share it.  Email them and say, \"I'm building this new thing and I want to reach more people who will find this useful. Email and referrals are two of the best ways to grow your subscribers. An email from a trusted source for 5-10 people will generate more subscriptions than a random Facebook post that most of your networks miss. ",

            "answer_text": "My advice? Learn from history. YouTube has been around for 12 years now and every \u201cviral\u201d video has a similar theme or something about it that makes it stand out for better or worse. Think down the path of \u201cridiculousness\u201d .. there is even a TV show by the same name. Do something out of the ordinary.. you need a gimmick that works but not just that it needs to get people laughing or talking. Relate to a life experience of yours or for most people. Make a song, a lot of \u201cMusic-Video\u2019s go viral if that\u2019s your aim. Make people like your personality and don\u2019t be \u201cBeta-Cucked\u201d into wanting to people to like you. Be de-sensitized and fearless, perform a stunt that takes bravery into stupidity and act like you don\u2019t care while stirring concern in your audience. Drama is one way to the top, skill is another Generally speaking you are going to need substantial amounts of ca$h/funding to help you setup a rig or \u201cstage\u201d for your act(s). cheap equipment is annoying and going to drive people away. Be dramatic/theatrical. People love enthusiasm and good acting. Remember you want to aim for the stars here so add copious amounts of narcissim/sociopathy to your personality perhaps.. Jake Paul and Onision are great examples to use\u2026 leach off of current trends. Stay current. Don\u2019t re-hash and re-brand what\u2019s been and gone, people cotton on to that. I\u2019m not an expert or famous myself but I recognise the \u201cformula\u201d\u2026 easier said than done of course.. assuming this is what you want. but the most creative/talented/untalented/brazen people are always a bit crazy. A bit of craziness goes a long way. You need to break-away from the constraints of normality. Learning that polite and introvert doesn\u2019t sell but what money can\u2019t buy is confidence.Think about losing weight and looking good athletic/muscular. Then you are playing the attraction card to get \u201cmega fans\u201d.. Think about leadership skills, never be beta cucked into making a response video for example, get other people to respond to you, therefore asserting yourself as the point of interest. Often it is the case i see that you need to offer something that (most) other people can\u2019t/won\u2019t/don\u2019t do in order to be a \u201cdesireable\u201d. But the keys are relatability, likability and/or being over the top. These are winning combinations. Lots of people want more subscribers. Willing but not able, able but not willing. You have to be both and commit to offering the world a service whether that be entertainment, music, political commentary. My father used to tell me \u201cp*** poor planning leads to p*** poor performance. Make a plan and stick to it. ",

            "answer_text": "Many of you are surely aware of the increasing competition in social networks. Millions of creative people and their imitators are in a tough competition among themselves for the attention of a huge audience, which is then easily monetized. In fact, the number of new and interesting ideas naturally decreases, unlike the growing at an unreasonable pace army of bloggers. You can see this situation more clearly on YouTube than anywhere else. It is caused by both the popularity of the resource itself and the availability of effective tools for a decent income. The times, where any talented person with a fresh idea would suddenly wake up famous, are far behind. And no matter how breakthrough and interesting your product (in the broad sense of the word) is, its popularization without having a decent amount of subscribers became almost impossible.  Most of those who have stepped on this difficult path of YouTube promotion understand it all well. Although, there are some little-known details that can bring down the entire planned strategy. The most dangerous thing is not knowing and not understanding the community for which the video is made for. And those who are sure that their content completely meets the needs of their target audience in most cases have their wishes unfulfilled. The point here is not to feel your potential viewers. It is impossible to absolutely guess what a community wants. At least due to the fact that it is not at all a group of the same people, but it consists of individuals with a unique spectrum of preferences. Subscribers is the main capital of a blogger on YouTube. It's no secret that to sell your product or promote an idea you need to introduce it to as many people as possible. This is an axiom that does not require proof. But in the world of YouTube, having a large number of subscribers has much more meaning. And there are reasons for that: 1. Ranking. A video released by a user with a bigger amount of subscribers takes the first place in the search and recommendation list of unsubscribed users. Naturally, some of them will be interested in the rest of the author\u2019s videos. Thus, we have a \u201csnowball\u201d effect: new fans are attracted because of the large number of the old ones. 2. Psychology. Human psychological attitudes, or more precisely instincts, play the main role here. The fact is that people are more willing to trust those who have more supporters. This is clearly seen in real life in the case of some politicians, whose power rests solely on such \u201ceffects\u201d. A good illustration can also be an example of queues in shopping centers. When initially uninterested in buying people come up to see what product attracted so many people\u2019s attention. In other words, in this case the principle is present as well: when you get subscribers, you attract new ones by doing this. And the more you get, the faster your audience grows. 3. Monetization. This point is the easiest to explain. If you get a lot of subscribers on YouTube, your channel is easier to be seen by advertisers. So you have every chance of becoming a product promoter, and for a short mention of it in your video you can get a decent fee. Also, by having a large audience you\u2019ll get advertising payments from YouTube itself. What can you do to increase the number of subscribers yourself? Sharing a link to your video with a subscription offer via other social networks can be more or less effective. The effectiveness of such an action again depends on the amount of subscribers you have on those platforms. If your audience is large there, then you have a decent chance, which cannot be said about those who are just starting to use social networks as an advertising channel. In this case you could use some third-party services, which can help you speed up the process a little bit. Something like http://mrpopular.net would do the trick here, but you could make your own research if you want. However, if you are a little more intricate and much more straightforward, you can try spamming links in the comments below the videos from famous bloggers. But you shouldn\u2019t forget that popular personalities consider themselves to be a separate privileged caste ruling in the open spaces of YouTube, because of which they show much more intolerance to such actions of plebeians. Therefore, in most cases your spam will be immediately blocked along with your account. And it\u2019s a miracle if your account doesn\u2019t get reported. Let me know if you have any questions. ",

            "answer_text": "There are TWO ways to make ur channel popular: FIRST and the most difficult is to do QUALITY CONTENT and post it REGULARY. Choosing white side - you automatically subscribe at all circles of hell, spending ur only free time, ur last money, unsleepable nights and etc.  1. Create a plan (and script) for your videos. The first step in getting started on your YouTube journey is to plan what your channel is going to be all about. Include as many details as possible into your video script: The exact words you are going to say.The actions you will be taking in the video.The main points you need to stress.Any necessary calls to action (click on this link, subscribe to my channel, etc.)Also, identify your target audience and write your script based off of their understanding. 2. Produce highly engaging content. It should go without saying, but you need to create content that is engaging, informative, and entertaining. Make sure it stays that way for the entire duration of the video. Losing the hook in the middle will cost you a lot of viewers. 3. Increase your uploading frequency. Now this is easier said than done, but you cannot ignore its validity. The main reason someone subscribes to a channel is because they love the work of the publisher and wants to see more of their videos. Release your videos in a timely. Try to publish one video per week or at least one or two per month. 4. Learn how to optimize your titles. One great way to do this is to give your videos offbeat names. This way, you\u2019re going to be getting a lot of people coming to your channel based on curiosity alone. To get a maximum amount of views, you will also need to dive into the SEO part of YouTube marketing. I suggest you: a) Use the keyword in the title, b) Use Google Adwords, c) Don\u2019t make the title too long, d) Make the title descriptive,e) Make the title engaging 5. Make the most of channel customizations. Use a custom background header that includes some design elements from your blog.  If you are going to get visitors to trust your brand on YouTube, you have to make the most of the customization options that YouTube has to offer. Make yourself appear professional, and viewers will be sure to respect and trust you. Make the most of the YouTube channel bio and custom URL(aviable after 300 subscribers) to finish up your channel customizations. You can always link to your blog\u2019s URL in the video description for a more detailed bio. 6. Create an engaging channel trailer. YouTube offers a great feature called channel trailers that lets you automatically play a video upon the opening of a YouTube channel. This is the moment where you need to catch your audience\u2019s attention within a few seconds. The perfect channel trailer is somewhere between 30 seconds to 60 seconds.  7. Make use of \u2018Call to Action\u2019 annotations. Many YouTubers have reported increased channel subscriptions with these annotations added to their videos. A simple link created for subscribing to the channel can be placed as a call to action in your video. If you\u2019re using a graphic to add a call to action, you can liven it up with a call to action annotation. If done in an unobtrusive way, you will see your channel subscriptions grow.  8. Optimize your video descriptions. Coming back to the SEO aspect of YouTube videos, the video description is not to be neglected.DON\u2019T OVERDO IT | DON\u2019T OVERDO IT | DON\u2019T OVERDO IT |The description will not only let your videos be found in search engines, they\u2019ll also give potential viewers an idea of what your video is about. 9. Make the most of meta tags. Metadata is something that plays a major role in getting your videos displayed in search results. You can browse some well-converting videos and see what meta tags they are using to give you some ideas. But don\u2019t just copy and paste meta tags - this won\u2019t help.  10. Use A YouTube Intro & Outro.  Your YouTube intro and outro not only helps in branding, it will make your video more entertaining. Having an intro and outro will serve your brand and offer your video a sense of professionalism. It\u2019s like the opening theme song of a TV show. I uses Adobe Primiere and Video Author Effect for my channels but for coach potatos I\u2019ve found first caught service Free Online Intro Maker | Renderforest. ________________________________________________________________End of white side) If you wanna get A LOT, EASY subscribers - you should choose dark side.In addition it could be FREE, just type in Google key words of ur target.  I won\u2019t tell exactly servecies WHERE and HOW TO BUY views and subscribers because i didn\u2019t read terms of privacy on Quora lol, but I repeat \u201cjust type in your search engine key words of your target\u201d and you shall find forums and serveces.Howewer, choosing the dark side, who know what will wait you in the end) In any case I wish good luck and don\u2019t give up!

            "answer_text": "I cannot promise that it will be fast. But here are some basic tips that you can use to increase your YouTube Subscribers: Always ask your viewers to Subscribe - The easiest way to start increasing your subscriber count is to start asking for it in your videos itself. Don\u2019t assume that this is automatic and viewers will always Subscribe. In your videos, give your viewers a compelling call to action and ask them to click the \u201cSubscribe\u201d button right above your video.2. Take advantage of Featured Channels - Another easy method for expanding your reach and getting more subscribers is to strategically partner with other YouTube content creators or influencers. On your YouTube channel page there is an option to add other \u201cFeatured Channels\u201d of those \u201cYouTubers\u201d you like and recommend. When you get other channels that have a similar audience to feature you, you can expect to see new viewers coming your way very quickly. Smart right? 3. Interact and Engage - Please keep in mind that YouTube is a community, not just a place to host your videos. You will start to see positive more results when you interact with the other members of this community. One of the best ways to build a following of subscribers is to support others in their YouTube marketing efforts. Comment, like and subscribe as frequently as possible to other content creators and influencers on YouTube, and wait for the results. It\u2019s a simple concept, really: the more you give, the more you get. Keep in mind that these are just the basic, it could maybe get you a few and even a hundred, but If you want a more advanced tips you may want to check this Blog that I always read. Their tips and suggestions really works so make sure to check them out. ",

            "answer_text": "This is what you need to get more subscribers and views: 1)Ranking your video for certain specific keywords related to your video, I do this with the help of an software that helps me rank on 1st page both on google as well as YouTube for long tail (less competition) keywords (this app just auto generates title and description for your video). You can do this manually, by including your keyword twice in the title and more than 3 times in description, something like that. And there are other factors like tags too, I am not an expert at that, so I don\u2019t know much as the app does that for me automatically. But remember as a new channel you must rank your video for keywords that have less competition and decent search volume. The app I use does keyword research too. Believe me ranking videos for search results will change your game and will help you grow your YouTube channel. 2)Good Thumbnail for your video so that you get attention of people who see it, and then they feel like clicking on it, because YouTube does show your videos at different places as suggestions to people watching similar videos and after ranking you will also appear in search results. You can create free Thumbnails on the Canva site. More people clicking on it also means YouTube algorithm will show it to even much bigger audience. 3)Good Content: Once people click on your video to view it after seeing your attention grabbing thumbnail they need to stay and watch most of your video, so if they clicked your video and didn\u2019t like your content they will leave soon which will tell YouTube algorithm that your video is not worth promoting to a bigger audience. So, make good content so that people watching it will stay till the end of the video. 4)Sharing your videos on Facebook groups, Other social media groups and even forum related to your video subject. For example, if your video is related to weight loss then you can join all weight loss related Facebook group, or other social media groups and forums that are related to weight loss and share your video there. Make sure that you don\u2019t spam your link everywhere in comments, someone can report you for spamming. Share the video as adding value. YouTube algorithm also looks at this as they see people coming from other sites to watch your video. This will definitely increase your channel authority. If anyone wants to rank their 1st video on YouTube, feel free to contact me, my FB contact is mentioned in the profile. If I have time, I\u2019ll definitely help you. Don\u2019t worry I don\u2019t charge :) ",

            "answer_text": "Hi! There are many ways for a YouTube channel to gain a following. I\u2019ll introduce a few effective methods! First: Study other YouTubers Study successful YouTubers and see if you can use any of their techniques to gain a following and grow your own channel. If you want to have a look at detailed studies on how big YouTubers became as big as they are, I\u2019ve done a few studies on my blog. Some YouTubers I\u2019ve studied that might give you some ideas include James Charles,Zoella, Jenna Marbles, and Markiplier! Second: Engage with your subscribers Full disclosure - I worked on this app. The Callmart app is all about putting people in touch and sharing knowledge. This translates well to the realm of YouTube since viewers tend to crave more direct forms of contact with their favorite YouTubers. There are two ways to approach using Callmart: 1) Money-making: Callmart primarily functions to earn you money as a seller of knowledge and your precious time. Essentially, you make money in your free time by offering one-to-one phone calls in the app to buyers interested in connecting with you personally. The app charges buyers the price you decided on a per-minute basis, and you will be paid instantly when a phone call ends. If you have a loyal following on YouTube, then we're sure you could find success using Callmart to connect with subscribers! 2) Channel promotion: Callmart can also uniquely function as an engagement-building app, which means you approach Callmart as a promotional activity primarily, and the money you earn from talking is just a bonus! The quality of each phone call ranks highly while quantity may not be as important to you. By leaving a good impression on viewers, even from chats as short as a few minutes, you can promote yourself and your channel by word-of-mouth, which is a proven way to gain long-term followers. We recommend this approach for YouTubers who are hoping to increase their subscribers and gain more views on videos. Of course, you can self-promote your content during phone calls, but remember to add a personal touch and really get to know your individual viewers. Third: Advertise on forums Advertise your YouTube channel online to gain more of a following! Use forums like YTtalk to spread the word about your channel to fellow YouTube users. Since YTtalk is a YouTube-specific forum, you\u2019re much more likely to find people who would be interested in subscribing! Some other places to spread the word would be YouTube-related subreddits, such as r/advertiseyourvideos, r/videos, or r/smallYTchannel. The more related to YouTube the site is, the better. Finally: Track your channel\u2019s progress With support for statistics from YouTube, Twitter, Twitch, Daily Motion, Mixer, and Instagram, Social Blade is one of the smartest ways to monitor your social media accounts to make sure your reach and influence are at their best. The app creates visually appealing charts and graphs of the data it collects to help you understand how your channel is performing in terms of subscriber rank, video view rank, and social blade rank. You can also take advantage of Social Blade as a way to see where your channel stands among your fellow YouTubers. This means you can measure your growth and compare it to channels of a similar size and theme. I hope this helps! Good luck gaining a bigger following for your YouTube channel. ",

            "answer_text": "When I first started my Youtube channel, there were a lot of people saying that the sub for sub method works, but the way Youtube work, it could end up backfiring. So, I decided I would go the organic way. Now, thankfully I work with a company that has a Youtuber who is kind enough to share some of her tips with everyone else and I was able to use three of them to start my own channel. Here are the three things I used to get my first 10 subs in just one month:  Now, there are a few things that I don\u2019t mention in this video and that\u2019s because I\u2019m planning to add them in my next Youtube milestone video, which will be once I hit 50 subs. However, I\u2019m willing to share some of them here. Testing Equipment So, when I started my channel I promised some of my students that I wouldn\u2019t use any more than $100 to do so, meaning I couldn\u2019t get a camera. I did this because no one would believe me when I told them you can start a channel with just your smartphone or laptop camera. So, right now I\u2019m using my phone\u2019s camera to record. As for a mic, I had a mic from when I took a public speaking class, however it didn\u2019t sound so good so I bought a new one. Next, I bought some lighting to help with the quality of my phone\u2019s camera and I\u2019ve played with different lighting positions to see which one I like best. Captions Captions are part of the SEO on Youtube. Youtube provides its own caption, but they usually have a few words mistranscribed, so I have a friend do the caption for me. Consistency I told myself that I would post one video, once a week on Thursday and I was able to do that with the first two videos, but then I missed a day and now I\u2019ve been posting every Friday. Starting a Youtube channel is like working a job, if you\u2019re not consistent then you won\u2019t get very far. Now, once you have a few thousand followers, then you might be able to lax a little. But not too much because people will get bored and leave. Why I don\u2019t use Sub4Sub Now, the reason I don\u2019t use Sub4Sub is that it could actually hurt your chances of getting the 4,000 watch hours you need to become a Youtuber. The way Youtube\u2019s algorithm seems to work is that they send your video to your subscribers first. If your subs aren\u2019t watching your videos, then it goes dead, Youtube won\u2019t promote it to anyone else and it will be pushed all the way down the search results. The chances of your subs watching your videos using this method are very low. So, you very well may reach the 1,000 subs, but if you aren\u2019t getting any views, it\u2019ll only hurt your channel. Lastly, the Sub4Sub method is against Youtube policies and you could lose your channel. Unlike IG, your content is probably done over gruing hours of taping, editing, and optimizing SEO, making it harder to start another Youtube channel if you lose everything. ",

            "answer_text": "Get the latest trends  This way, you will be able to get the right picture of what's popular at this moment in the country you live in. However, you can also explore trends popular in other countries. You need to ensure that the new videos you create are not distant from the sound and the relevance of the previous vids on your channel. This is extremely important to keep your current followers. For example, if your vlog is about fitness and diet, there's no problem creating videos about the latest songs, even though the topic is currently in vogue. Optimize your YouTube video for search engines Make sure your YouTube video title includes the keywords your viewers will search for. Then, when you write a video description, make sure to include those keywords / phrases. Do not sacrifice flow or clarity for keyword density. Google rewarded for good content and punished keyword stuffing. Once your YouTube videos show more with search engines, they will also show up better to your viewers as they find your content easier. Each new viewer is a new potential subscriber. Post regularly and consistently Consistency is key, since subscribers will not subscribe if you do not update your channel, or if you update 4 times in a week and then take one month off. If you can update your ongoing series like this, you'll have gold to give subscribers unique video content that not only keeps your current subscribers but also attracts subscribers. new and increase the level of video interaction. Make use of the comments to get more subscribers. Create spreadsheets and valuable document reviews for your channel's development. These are honest reviews that tell you what works and what does not work. The comment section is also a complete goldmine idea for your next vlog. Use your call-to-action  A call-to-action is essential for YouTube videos as they give you the opportunity to turn ordinary viewers into subscribers, potential customers, or even paying customers. Make sure you not only make a call to action to visit your website. Instead, start by asking viewers to share videos only. You do not want to look too hard on the stock, but a simple request can make a big difference. ",

In a nutshell, your viewers can now subscribe by clicking on the captions inside your video. Create a script for your video.  Decide what you like to create and focus on developing relevant skills. Do not mimic the trend of YouTube channels. Doing what you love is more important than success on YouTube (and in life). Videos tend to work better if you write scripts because scripts help you streamline your video and get you on the right track. By sticking with a script, you'll be able to keep track of it without having to pay attention to an unrelated topic. This script will also ensure that the perfect event stream leads to a well-focused video. Start playlist Playlists let you divide your videos into categories that provide quick and easy reference for viewers.  This is better than uploading a video only after another video does not have a specific category, making it difficult for viewers to find videos related to a particular topic (like looking for a needle in a haystack). When a person is watching a video that appears in a playlist, this often encourages him to watch more videos, thereby increasing the number of views. Another great benefit of playlists is that they demonstrate your knowledge of persistence in your video. Name your video according to the strategy You have a name in your head, but it can be something complicated or too long. My rule is to stay current and use YouTube's auto-complete feature to name your video. There is nothing wrong with your video having the same name or something that is close to the popular video, as long as the video is relevant. ",

However, if your content doesn't provide any value to everyone, you'll have to struggle to increase your YouTube subscribers.

Remember that the most effective way you can get more YouTube subscribers is when your video starts getting more views. And your current subscribers will be able to watch and review your videos only when they are happy and helpful. Keep your related channels on One of the biggest mistakes I have made in business channels is that they turn off the channel related feature on YouTube. When I talk to the business owner, the reason I get is that they are afraid that their opponent will show up as related channels. By turning off channels of related channels, you also remove yourself from YouTube suggestions. This means that you lose the network effect, making YouTube as strong as it is now. Ads for other videos have screens that end You need to verify your YouTube account to access these features. To do this, click your profile picture at the top right, then click on 'Creator Studio Lau. Next, click on the tab \u2018Status and features.

Always ask yourself \u201cif this wasn\u2019t my video - would I want to watch it? If you wouldn\u2019t why will other people! Even remove (by making private) any videos that you\u2019re not happy with. Then look for people who have similar interests to yours. And subscribe to their channels, write interesting comments on their channel. I personally always check out any new subscribers and If I like their uploads subscribe back (I feel sure many others do too) Other people will see your comments and check yours out (NEVER ASK THEM TO - it makes you look like a spammer) if those checking out your channel like it, they\u2019ll subscribe, always go to their channel and if you like what you see SUBSCRIBE. When anyone comments on one of your videos reply to them especially if the comment requires an answer, but sometimes \u201cthanks\u201d is enough, This process is known as INTERACTION. (unfortunately too many don\u2019t understand the meaning of the word and think it involves \u201csub for sub\u201d or spamming on every forum they can find). Ignore many videos explaining how to get subscribers too quickly, I saw one linked to here on Quora explaining how to get 10,000 subscribers quickly.

Analytics are ONLY helpful when you\u2019re getting enough traffic to your videos. But you have to have a way to first get traffic to your videos. That being said if you\u2019re willing to shell out some money one of the ways to get traffic fast is to run ads on YouTube for your channel. You can create ads that will show up in the search results or you could shoot your own video ad and have it play before other videos on YouTube (all of this is done via Google Ads). If you don\u2019t want to pay then you need to do a few things: Research your audience and figure out what type of content they want to see. What are they already watching? What can you learn from the videos they\u2019re already watching?Pay for a tool like TubeBuddy or VidIQ (basic plans are like $10/month). Use those tools to research videos on YouTube and what keywords (tags) people are using in your niche. Also do some research to find out what keywords are getting a lot of search volume without a ton of competition on YouTube. Then make videos around those keywords.This might be the MOST important part\u2026Make ENTERTAINING videos. I\u2019ve learned the hard way that you can make the most valuable video on the planet\u2026a video that if people watched and implemented could make them thousands and thousands of dollars\u2026but if it\u2019s not entertaining, they\u2019ll stop watching and move on to the next thing.

Show up every week for the next few years. The biggest fitness channel on YouTube, Fitness Blender, started in 2009. They consistently made videos for THREE years before they had enough traction to really take off and make a big difference on YouTube and in their own lives. Do the work and keep showing up!",

I currently run two YouTube channels. One is for gaming: Malcolm Rose The other is for educating people about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies: https://www.youtube.com/channel/... Both are still pretty small (about 250 and 50 subscribers respectively) but while running them I\u2019ve learned a lot about marketing. The trick is to post your videos in relevant places. If you run a gaming channel, for example, post about your latest videos in subreddits, Discords, forums, etc devoted to the game you\u2019re playing. Obviously be careful to follow the rules - some communities do have rules against excessive advertising (or any advertising at all!) Leverage the power of social media by posting your videos with appropriate hashtags on places like Twitter. Above all, focus on putting out good content. If you are creating quality, generative work, word of mouth will do a lot for you. I also recommend setting up your own webpage if you don\u2019t have one - a website that you control completely which points people towards your work. It doesn\u2019t have to be complicated - mine is pretty simple: RoseCrypto Educational Cryptocurrency Reviews and Guides Having your own webpage will allow people to easily and quickly get an idea of who you are and what you\u2019re doing. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi there! Get more Youtube subscribers seem like a difficult task, but I\u2019ll share some tips to help you get more subscribers: Name Your Videos StrategicallyOne of the most difficult things is to name your video. You have the name in your head, but it may be something complex or too long. My rule is to keep it basic and use the YouTube autocomplete to name the video. There is nothing wrong with your video having the same name or something close to a popular video, as long as it\u2019s relevant. Post Useful Content ConsistentlyThis is one of the most difficult things to do as a content creator. If you take a look around YouTube you might think that every video under the sun has been created and that is most likely true, but you can put your own spin on a popular topic. For example, there are many \u201cunboxing\u201d tech videos\u2026what if you created a \u201creboxing\u201d and talk about the various components of tech while you put it back in the box? The key here is creativity and that will certainly boost subscriptions. Shoot In Various LocationsI believe that shooting in various locations can lead to more interest. I understand that may not be possible or you may have a set, but try to change a background or even use a green screen. Like the clich\u00e9 says, \u201cvariety is the spice of life\u201d so mix it up with your backgrounds and locations. Spruce Up Your Channel DesignMost visitors first impression of you is from your channel and your design. This is where visitors interact and get to know what you are about. Create a engaging header and show off your brand. Show Your Lighter SideLighten up and laugh at yourself. Bloopers make you more human and show something different than an ordinary talking head video. Also, switch up the video and catch your viewers off guard so they don\u2019t know what to expect. Ask For SubscribersThis is very basic. At the end of every video ask viewers to \u201clike\u201d and subscribe to your channel. You should also tell them why they should subscribe, for example if you are a DIY Home Improvement channel I would say, \u201csubscribe for my DIY projects, tricks and insider tips delivered to you weekly.\u201d Remember, be careful what you ask for, because you might get it. Create A Custom ThumbnailI have seen my subscriptions and views increase by adding this step. I use impact font that is seen on many internet photos to grab attention and I format the photo using Adobe Photoshop. I usually title the photo thumbnail differently than the video because when people are scrolling through other videos to view, they can easily tell what my video is about. Use AnnotationsAnnotations are those annoying things that pop up during videos, but they can be a content creator\u2019s dream. I add annotations to every video and make it easy by creating a link for them to subscribe. This is extra work, but once you see your subscription rate increase you will continue to add them to every video. Be YourselfYou are the best you\u2014you can be. Being on camera was difficult for me at first because I compared myself to others who are natural on camera talent then I realized, \u201cI just have to be me.\u201d Let your personality shine in your videos and I guarantee someone will connect with you. Create An Engaging Channel TrailerWith the new channel design, YouTube gives content creators a great opportunity to create a trailer to share what your content is about. Keep your trailer under 90 seconds and show scenes from your other videos and provide a strong call to action of why a viewer should become a subscriber. If you are new and need a subscribers base in order gain more subscribers, you may first purchase subscriber from specific service provider. Hope that is insightful for you! Good Luck!  ",

            "answer_text": "Optimize your title. Being able to distinguish the most important aspect of success on YouTube.  A great way to do this is to give your video an unusual name. This way, you will attract a lot of people to your channel based solely on curiosity. An odd title will play an important role in getting views that your channel needs to benefit from social proof. In a nutshell, learn how to write compelling, relevant and optimized titles. Technical Techniques for Success on YouTube Get thumbnails, for example.  During the second split when the viewer decides which video they will watch, your thumbnail may be the last game changer. This is a very small but important point to remember every time you upload a new video. Similarly, there are many small steps you can take to increase the number of subscribers to your channel. For example, end cards with large Subscriptions buttons can motivate viewers to subscribe to your channel in a subtle way. Use a strong call-to-action in your annotations. Near the end of your video, encourage viewers to subscribe to your channel. Never try to reach the ideal length for your video The ideal length of your YouTube Channel is unique to you. It depends on a lot of factors such as genre and even your presentation style.  Never listen to any of these tips. No one can tell you the ideal length of your YouTube video. Set the time that you feel is ideal. Something is not too long nor too short. You will be able to reach this balance when you create more than one video. ",

Give 110% everytime to your content and then never be disappointed with the response and also do not get to obsessed with your response, just get through it and work more hard.The popular YouTube content creators like Technical Guruji, Harh Beniwal, Amit Bhadana, BB Ki Vines, Ashish Chanchalani, Technical Sagar, Pewdiepie, Shroud, Dynamo Gaming, Mortal, Carryminati and many more once had very less subscribers and not much views came to their videos.

The very first thing before anything you would have to do is create quality content and focus on the content and not the subscribers. Second, be consistent. If you are posting videos whenever you feel like than trust me it won\u2019t work. You need to develop a schedule, maybe one video every week or 2 weeks. but if you can make more than 1 video every week than do it. But do remember to focus on the content, I can\u2019t stress this enough QUALITY > QUANTITY. Once you have enough content, you would need to promote it. Start by sharing it your friends and families. Promote your videos on other social medias eg : facebook, reddit, twitter etc. Remember you are a brand and you would have to do promotion to get it out there for other people to find you. Lastly, Don\u2019t give up. It might take you months or years for your content to be discovered but if you are consistent and producing quality content. Then people will stick around and watch your videos. The key is to not gain subscribers but FOLLOWERS. GOODLUCK. P.S This is my channel : Merc ",

            "answer_text": "Well,if you wanted to get a lot of subscribers legally,there are some easy steps to take. Firstly,if you are starting a YouTube channel,you should focus on a particular subject. For example,gaming.Branching of into various subjects can be counterproductive as YouTube tends to promote channels that are focused on a particular subject than all rounder channels. Secondly,if you want people to subscribe to you try to have good audio and video quality. This is very important as I have seen various channels with good videos but lack one or both of the above mentioned qualities. People usually subscribe to channels that can give them quality content instead of channels that have almost nonexistent video or audio quality. So moving on to point three. Have your on original ideas. Yes ,making videos that belongs to a specific subject that has been used over and over can help you gain some views like you laugh you lose videos or meme compalations. But people like to see something different in a channel. Yep,there will be haters for sure but people will like you more if you stick to your on unique ideas. Number four, try to add subtitles for your videos and make nice thumbnails for your videos. Making thumbnails is kind of more easier than you expect\u2026 There are a lot of videos on YouTube that helps you make thumbnails by just using Adobe\u2026 And about subtitles,people will appreciate if you do that and even more if you make it funny. And five (I don't recommend it) if you have a lot of money to spare ,there are numerous sites on the internet that sells you views and subs for money. This goes against the spirit of YouTube but it is still legally allowed. Make videos and try not to get demonitised or copystriked,man ",

            "answer_text": " Two ways to get your channel to One Million Subscribers Okay, so you will need to put in a lot of time, hard work, and consistency. All of which are great tips I might add but, sadly when it comes to Youtube it is not that simple. Example: The most recent example that may take you for a loop would be a new YouTuber who hit 1 Million subscribers after her first two videos. She goes by the name of Jennelle Eliana. Once her video was promoted on the trending page people took a liking to it and decided to watch. It is unclear to say how or why she made it on to the trending page with her first two videos but, that is how her channel took off. Example: Mr. Beast, They used a classic formula from the earlier days of youtube. The community hadn't seen this style in the spotlight for a few years and they brought it back. By no means is this a reason to hate on them or others, it is great to see someone different on the trending pages rather than the usual faces one may see when they first click on the website. This is merely an example of why getting your channel to one million subscribers can be a tricky and strange process. I will now present a few tried and true ways to get your channel to one million subscribers organically then I will list other ways that may not be as practical.  Organic Growth: Make sure you enjoy making the videos you create.Post consistentlyThis could be once a day, once a week, or once a month and all these methods have been proven to work by successful channels on Youtube.Promote yourself to those who already know you, don\u2019t be too pushy about it though. Just keep letting them know casually that you are making videos and you\u2019d appreciate it if they supported you and gave you feedback to help you grow.As you grow engage find ways to engage with your audience however you see fit.Have Patience and enjoy your journeyYou will have to develop a tough skin because the internet, as we know, can be brutal at times. Don\u2019t allow \u201chaters\u201d to take away your light.Non-Practical Growth: If you happen to have an abundance of money and a few connections you could buy your view count to make it appear as if you have a huge audience. This is what many artists in the music industry do when they release a new music video or song on Youtube in order to get their video placed at the top. This method does not always work because there are other variables that come into play as well.Go to all of the biggest events and Cons or wherever other well-known YouTubers are in an attempt to make a collaboration video with them. Needless to say, this could also be difficult.3. Try to make viral videos. This is also difficult because viral videos are random and you never know what will work and what won\u2019t. No one could have seen the Look at all those chickens video coming. lol ",

            "answer_text": "1. Be Yourself Be yourself in the video because that's what you're comfortable with and no one wants to watch a fake. Post original content and try to stand out from other YouTubers, without being a fake. People love it when they're watching someone who's real and doesn't fake happiness for the sake of the video. They'd rather watch real emotions, or...at least I would rather watch real emotions. 1. Be Consistent 2. Be Consistent You need to have a set schedule of how often you post your videos, preferably weekly. 3. Edit In order to make a good video you need to edit out anything that would ruin the video, and add some things that would make it better such as: Intro, endcard(at the end of each video there should be a platform where you promote/advertise your previous video(s) and prompt the audience to subscribe to your channel),  bloopers that could entertain the audience(at the end of the video), cool transitions(but not too many), etc. 4. Advertise Promote your content on all the social medias you have, and tell your friends and family about your channel(If you're comfortable with that). It's the quickest way to get subscribers. If people you know are subscribed, they'll more likely share your content than those who don't know you at all.  ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s usually pretty easy to gain subscribers in the short term. Keeping them is the hard part. There are actually many ways to get subscribers fast. One of my favorite ways back in the day was to go to a popular YouTuber\u2019s channel and participate in the comments section. I wouldn\u2019t beg or even ask for subscribers, but I would go down the comment list and just chat with people. Eventually, some of them would go check out my channel! Another easy way to gain subscribers is to make friends! If you have friends in the real world that you hang out with, ask them to subscribe. Maybe go find a community of gamers and make friends there. Friends are always an easy way to gain subscribers. If you really just want to increase that sub number without increasing the number of views your videos get, go do Sub4Sub. This way you can sub to peoples channels and they will sub back to yours. They might not watch any of your videos, but if all you care about is the sub number, then you\u2019re good! OF course, you\u2019ll never become a successful YouTuber by just increasing your subscriber count\u2026 To be successful, you need to grow your audience! Your audience consists of all of the people who actually sit down and watch your videos. Some members of your audience may be subscribers, and some may not be. The important distinction to make is that not all subscribers are audience members. In fact, using programs like Sub4Sub is a great way to increase your subscriber count without gaining any new audience members. This is how you could have 5,000 subscribers and only 10 views per video. Growing your audience is not easy. It requires a consistent upload schedule and entertaining videos to keep your viewers coming back for more. Good luck my friend. Keep at it and you can do it! ",

Do something different in your video to attract an audience (if you'll be like everyone else it's boring ...)Choose high-quality images to promote your videos and your channel!Publish your channel and a talk about your videos on your social media, give a link to your YouTube on any social platform you use - the easiest audience is your friends and family!In each video, add a link to another video of yours, describe your videos, add a link to a playlist containing multiple of your videos, promote your video in any way possible. Respond to people who create videos from the same niche as yours, and encourage them to watch your videos, to create a shared video, and more ...You can also buy some subscribers to get more subs in a natural way, what do I mean?

            "answer_text": "There are a lot of ways available to get more & more YouTube Subscribers. Just need to implement these properly. Here I am going to share 15 best strategies to get a lot of youtube subscribers fast.  If you are looking for the easiest ways for this, then I want to say that nothing is easy. The methods I am going to tell are easy to see, but it is a bit difficult to apply continuously. But it is also true that nothing is complicated. It may be you have heard earlier about these strategies that I have mentioned here, but I am going to introduce these in a different way. If you are ready, then let's move forward without wasting any more time. 1. Create and Post Highly Engaging and Watchable Content: I know that now you will be thinking that it is not so hard but wait a bit it is not so easy also, for that you need to do a lot. To make your video engaging and watchable, you have to adopt the following methods. 1.1 Do Research More & More on your Topic: It is the first step to making a nice attractive video. Watch more and more youtube videos and read a lot of articles related to your topic, and note all the main points from these which you want to add in your video.  It means you collect more & more information for your video as it is good to provide as much information as possible in your video. It also attracts your audience to come back to your channel. 1.2 Make a powerful script: It is also a part of creating an engageable content. I know that many of you do not like writing scripts before making videos. But believe it is a necessary process. Why? Because when you make a script and make your video on its basis, then you lose the chances of wandering from your rhythm, as well as you can show your story in the same powerful way as you thought earlier.  It keeps you at the center point of your video always when you create. By doing so, your viewers feel that you are providing them with full information and the chance of it increases that they subscribe to your channel. 1.3 Shoot your video like a professional: As far as video shooting is concerned, you need to bring professionalism into it. Now you are thinking that how you can make your video like a professional? Do you have to buy an expensive camera and lighting system for it? My answer is a big NO. Nowadays the quality of the camera coming on your mobile phone is close to a much more expensive DSLR. You can prepare a good lighting system using some old things at home. And if it comes to the mic so you can use your mobile headphone like a mic. If you are thinking of shooting a video at your home then you can set up your studio like this:  1.4 Make sure that the first 30 seconds of your video is the most attractive: The first 30 seconds of any video is its most important part, and it ensures that how your entire video will be. It is the time when your YouTube subscribers or visitors can leave your channel. So try to make the first 30 seconds of your video as attractive as possible so that the focus of your visitors is concentrated in your video. 2. Limit the length of the video within 5 minutes: However, the length of any video depends on its content. If you want to make a video with a demo on a topic, then it is clear that the video will be long. As far as it comes to the ideal length of a YouTube video, the best length of a YouTube video is less than 5 minutes, because you will see that such videos perform well on YouTube, which are less than 5 minutes. ComScore also presented a report in January 2014, in which it clarified that the average length of most YouTube videos that performed well was 4.4 minutes. So apparently this length is perfect for a youtube video. If you are thinking about an ideal length, then the answer is in front of you. You can understand it well through this infographic:  Source: Buffer Blog 3. Create Eye-catching Thumbnails: You all know that how thumbnail plays a big role for any YouTube video. It is known to the world that if the thumbnail of the video is so attractive, then the chance of watching your video will increase. Naturally, this will increase your subscriber as well. An example of the ideal thumbnail:  Let's understand it through a short story: suppose, you have two books and both are of the same category. The cover of the first book is very well decorated. It looks like it will be the best book in its category. On the other hand, the cover of the second book is made very simple. Now it's your turn, tell me which book you would like to read? I know that you would like to read the first one. It also applies to the thumbnail of your video as well.  I can not write all the 15+ strategies here (in Quora) because this post will be very long to write and explain all strategies. You can read all the strategies for getting more YouTube Subscribers by clicking on the link given here on my blog, where I have explained it in more detail with examples.

But it's not impossible, what you are missing is : Intro, you really need to get an intro, it doesn't need to be fancy expensive intro but you should have it.\u201cGet to the point\u201d, First explain the game in short words, fast, simple and to the point, later on, if you want to go in depths, you can but it's not necessary. A lot of people just want a simple review to see if the game is good or not.Don't explain the gameplay but rather try to score and categorize, your gameplay. example: Graphics, Physics, Story, Engine, etc\u2026Scoring should be based on, either previous games of the same production or on similar games. You can even compare categories with other games.At the end of the video, create a conclusion and give it an overall score which was based on previous categories.Also, you can watch some of Gameranx videos and see how they are doing it.And for god, sake throws out those tasteless jokes, what are you 5 years old, remember you are trying to make people like you and your content, so you cant say whatever you want, and whenever you want it. If you really want to create a channel where you could throw in some jokes like that, do that later on when you have more subscribers and do it like an experiment to see how they would react. Because you are not making videos for adults only here, there will be children watching your reviews also, so be careful what you say because you can get banned very easily. ",

            "answer_text": "There is only one proper way to do this and that is by buying ad space. Let me explain. When YT sees you have uploaded a new video it tests that video out on a group of people that it thinks may be interested in it. If you have 10k fake/bought followers then what YT sees is that you made a video that none of your followers are interested in. This causes the video to be suppressed and your channel to stop growing. However there is a way to legally buy real followers who will engage with you. Ads - and I would start with Facebook. There are many strategies here but one of my favorites is to offer a free gift (we run a number of online stores so this is what we usually use to find a gift). The ad is for a chance to win the gift - all they have to do is subscribe to me\u2026 on whatever platform, email list, or channel I\u2019m promoting. If you engage this group properly, have a good gift that they like, etc then you can get some great followers this way. One important lesson we\u2019ve learned while doing this: be super specific about trying to engage people who are really going to be interested in your content. If you don\u2019t then you\u2019ll still get follows but many of them will also be low quality followers who do not engage with your content much. ",

            "answer_text": "How do I get subscribers fast for my YouTube channel? From my experience, I can say that all depend on your PROMOTION. The reason why I really stress on promotion because even if you have the very best videos but if it doesn\u2019t reach more people, it won\u2019t go anywhere. That being said, today I\u2019m gonna share with you how you can promote your video beyond expected to get more subscribers in determine time frame. As for the beginning, it\u2019s recommended to get some subscribers from reputable site first to get the ball rolling. One that is reputable is AppSally.  Now, you can start doing the promotion thingy to start get exposure for your videos and achieve target that you aims for that is increase subscribers fast. Instead of only promote your video in YouTube only by minding the SEO and so on, you can use another option and social networks that you can leverage. Use the power of social media - People keep talking about social media as the best platform in promoting. Yes it\u2019s proven though. If you can mix them together with YouTube, just imagine the traffic that you will receive. Post about your YouTube videos there and seek to ignite people\u2019s attention. If you can catch their attention, the path for you to go viral is easy. But first, you need to think how to write a convincing post with attractive attachment such as picture, info-graphic or even snapshot of your videos. Explore discussion website - Some people might not use to it as one of the good platform actually to promote things. But within limit, don\u2019t be spammy. I remind you! There are a lot of discussion website such as Reddit, Softonic and Quora. People who joining discussion website usually people who always hungry for knowledge or people who always seeking for innovation. Hence, they love to ask and discuss among each other. This is because more heads is better than one head. Imagine if your video posses information that they seeking for. Automatically they will watch and might subscribe to your channel because they want more. Start blogging - If you haven\u2019t, this is the right time to get started. As these days, most of content management platforms make it easy to embed video, so no reasons why not you also joining them. Blog can help fill in the gap for one dynamic pairing. What you can do after start your own blog and be active on it, you need to give your own videos a home on your website. Set it up like a blog so that each \u201carticle\u201d is a different video instead of an article. If you do it interestingly, you can attract more views as well as subscribers. Start to grow now! ",

            "answer_text": "Video content is leading the way in the content marketing scene. YouTube is currently the leading platform for video blogging (vlogging), video sharing, and video marketing. It is a free platform offered by Google, and many (including me) love it. Facebook and Twitter have recently stepped into the video marketing game, but they still fall way short of having the kind of impact that YouTube has. Be consistent: The \u201cone-and-done\u201d approach does not work on YouTube. If you want the views and the traffic, you need to be posting and updating your content consistently for best results. Have a planned and proper schedule.Provide value: If your video fails to provide any real value to the end user, don\u2019t be surprised when it doesn\u2019t get any real views. Each video needs to deliver your best content.Be remarkable: Today, it\u2019s not enough to be posting weekly videos with your tips and content. You must convey your content in an engaging and entertaining format. Do something creative and unique that separates you from the rest. In short, your videos need to be remarkable. The biggest sin is to be boring. How can your videos be the opposite of boring?#1: Ask for Subscribers The simplest way to begin increasing your subscriber count is to start asking for it in your videos. Never assume that your viewer will subscribe just by watching your video. In your videos, give your audience a compelling call to action and ask them to click the \u201cSubscribe\u201d button. Ask them to subscribe.Tell them why to do it.For example: \u201cTo stay up to date with my latest videos, make sure to subscribe to this YouTube channel by clicking the subscribe button\u201d #2: Use Annotations Annotations are the little colorful sticky notes that people paste all over their videos once they\u2019ve been uploaded to YouTube. If you use this tool right, then it can be a great way to add subscribers. There are two effective uses for annotations that I recommend: Call-to-action annotation: Add a \u201cspeech bubble\u201c annotation to all of your old and existing videos asking the viewers to subscribe.#3: Add a YouTube Widget to Your Blog If you already have a website/ blog that is getting traffic, this is a great opportunity to leverage those visitors and make them subscribe to your channel with the click of a button. If you are using wordpress, then there are lots of plugins available to do so. #4: Leverage Featured Channels A great method for increasing your reach and harvesting subscribers is to strategically partner with other YouTube content-creators. Directly on your YouTube channel page is an option to add other \u201cFeatured Channels\u201d of those \u201cYouTubers\u201d you like and recommend. When you get other channels that have a similar audience to feature you, you can expect to see new viewers coming your way very quickly! Also Create a plan and script for your videos.Produce highly engaging contentHave a consistent upload scheduleIncrease your upload frequencyoptimize your video titlePersonalize video thumbnailsCreate an engaging channel trailerMake use of \u2018Call to Action\u2019 annotationsLimit the videos to under 5 minutes (go for something more than 5 minutes if it is really needed, else stick to under 5 minute plan)Optimize your video descriptionMake the most of meta tagsInteract with your fan baseArrange some giveawaysAsk your friends to watch, like, comment and also share your videos with as many people as possible.

Don't read off it out of shot, despite your best efforts people will notice this. Try and practice what your going to say beforehand.VideoI know it's quicker to upload in lower quality, but viewers really appreciate it if you upload your videos in at least 720p.Make sure the camera is steady.If there's something distracting in the background, move it or film elsewhere.Try and stick to a theme in your content.

One of the best tips I got from this video below was that everyone talks about search optimisation, when instead we should focus on getting in SUGGESTED videos. Because although people might search for an initial video, they then look in the sidebar or the recommended videos (or even the homepage) for most other videos. To get shown in suggested more we need: * To have a strong video ending where we tell viewers to go watch a similar videos of ours that\u2019s connected. Don\u2019t say \u201cthanks for watching etc etc\u201d or you lose everyone before your end card. Send them to a specific relevant video and youtube will form the connection. * Have consistent thumbnails - have a theme or design or closeup of your face they can recognise even on small mobile screen. Otherwise people don\u2019t know it\u2019s you even if you get in sidebar! * Focus on watch time as the key metric to get youtube to promote your videos more. It\u2019s actually better to have LESS VIEWS but more watch time. Having a strong hook in those first 15 seconds is crucial for this. * Many more strategies in the video below, but definitely aiming to get in suggested videos will massively boost your channel growth and subscriber count.

The are things you can do to help increase revenue on YouTube and those are: ensure your content is extremely viewable and desirable by a lot of people. The more people that find your video and watch your video with ads, the more revenue you will make Quality and volume together can increase revenue. For example 1 good video a week versus 10 good videos a week will be 1/10th the revenue potential. Think of it as casting a net. I frankly don't have time to do more than one per week and keep any kind of quality that I would be proud of. Just remember - Great content is king Create a channel on YouTube, Upload some videos which you have created yourself (it shouldn\u2019t be a copyright of any other). After that follow some channels of your interest and engage yourself with the community by replying to some of the videos and interacting with them. In this way, you\u2019ll be able to build some reputation in community no matter how small it is and you\u2019ll start getting some subscribers and even views on the video. Now apply for Google Adsense Monetization Program of YouTube and once approved, you can enable monetization on your videos. The more views you get, the more you earn. Key is to build audience and subscribers. Good Luck! ",

For example: They both have different channels, with this video they are able to get more subscribers  Analysis and learn from the similar Youtubers:  Do not copy. Try and upload fresh content Remember the most important thing : Youtube works on algorithm in which the video which is seen more than 80\u201390% is more suggested by youtube, which means the video should be engaging to connect with the audience. The audience should stick to the video or else the video wont be seen in the suggestion list Use proper keywords to rank in the algorithm. Dont misuse or overuse keywords Select your niche and you will get paid accordingly. Use proper thumbnail to attract the audience. Remember, thumbnail should connect to the video. For Example:  Dont get into the trap of the copyright issues. So, always upload copyright free original videos You can use good music from NCS and other sources such as soundcloud You can also use adwords to promote your video till it goes viral DONT get into clickbaits or any other agencies which promise you to get more views/likes which can harm your channel Youtube now has very strict policies, violating them can lead to suspension of you youtube channel If you like my answers pls upvote and Subscribe to my channel www.youtube.com/c/JumaniBaba Most Important: Dont loose hope!

If you take a look around YouTube you might think that every video under the sun has been created and that is most likely true, but you can put your own spin on a popular topic. For example, there are many \u201cunboxing\u201d tech videos\u2026what if you created a \u201creboxing\u201d and talk about the various components of tech while you put it back in the box? The key here is creativity and that will certainly boost subscriptions. 2. Name Your Videos Strategically One of the most difficult things is to name your video. You have the name in your head, but it may be something complex or too long. My rule is to keep it basic and use the YouTube autocomplete to name the video. There is nothing wrong with your video having the same name or something close to a popular video, as long as it\u2019s relevant. 3. Spruce Up Your Channel Design Most visitors first impression of you is from your channel and your design. This is where visitors interact and get to know what you are about.

Check out the trailer from AmazingPhil YouTube channel which has more than 4 Million subscribers:  Use the power of a pitch A great way of engaging users in your channel is to give them something to look forward to. You can use the power of a pitch in the \u2018about\u2019 section of your channel. Instead of simply asking the viewers to like, share and subscribe your content, you can pitch them to check out more of your content that relates with the current video or give them a teaser about what you plan to release next. This is the best method to add free subscribers to your YouTube channel. Invoke a sense of familiarity in the thumbnails Very often, people open up YouTube videos based on the thumbnail. Sometimes, the thumbnail overshadows the title of a video. Therefore, by having some consistency in the type of thumbnails you use, you can create an aura of coherency in your channel. A tidy and organized channel is easier to navigate through as well. Collaboration is a great way to increase your audience, use it wisely There would be YouTube content creators that create videos similar to the one you create. Maybe, there\u2019s another channel out there that compliments the content on your channel. Seeking a collaboration with another content creator proves to be a wise move at that time. Do the math, the audience of both the channels comes together to watch a single video. Moreover, collaborations go a long way and pave the way for more resources and opportunities. A helping hand doesn\u2019t hurt, right?  Make use of what\u2019s already viral Instead of researching for a topic, you can look into the trending topics in the internet . For instance, even if you are an independent music creator, it is a good idea to cover era-defining songs every now and then. Making use of topics running around in the news is another great strategy. You can also try to incorporate what people are already talking about. Just look at the trending channels on YouTube, and you\u2019ll get enough information on what you should create next. Share your videos in the communities related to your niche Sharing videos on mainstream social media platforms is something that everyone does. However, there are certain communities on platforms like Pinterest, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and many more where you can share your content and get the most out of it. Communities that are already interested in your niche aren\u2019t that hard to find, and in the era of the internet taking your content to them is a pretty doable job. If you use these 6 steps rigorously, no one can stop you from adding thousands of free subscribers to your YouTube channel. And these organic subscribers would definitely add maximum value to your channel. These subscribers would help you in your overall success as a YouTube solopreneur. ",

            "answer_text": "Find something you are passionate and make a channel surrounding that topic. However, it is important to note that not all topics can succeed on YouTube. While you may be passionate about a novel you are currently writing, making a bunch of YouTube videos about how your novel is coming along really only appeals to you and a small amount of other people who may also be invested in your story. Instead, to better your chances of growing your channel and gaining subscribers, make a channel that is about writing in general. Talk about how to develop an idea, structure a story, create interesting and realistic characters, and build a world. Things like that will appeal to pretty much anybody who is interested in writing a novel of their own, and maybe even anyone who is interested in writing in general, therefore you will be able to reach a far larger audience who is interested in your topic. Then advertise and promote your videos. Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit are some good places to advertise your channel and videos. Another important thing to note is that consistency is nice, but no longer necessary to succeed on YouTube. Quality is more important than quantity, so take your time when editing your videos, and post as often as what is convenient for you. You do not want to upload three low-quality videos a day, all of which may come across as amateur or unattractive to your viewers; take your time. That said, don\u2019t post once or twice a year and expect your channel to blow up. Unless they are exceptional videos that you are prepared to advertise and promote the crap out of, you will find that posting too little is just as damaging as posting too much. ",

            "answer_text": "That's a great question. I would always think it's out of passion and am not hear chasing views and subs. Passion is great but getting noticed is important. There's no point putting out great content when no one's really discovering you and watching you. So getting discovered is the key! Here are some of my time-tested and battle-tested hacks: Pay attention to what people are searchingYou're creating videos for people. So take some time to understand what questions they are asking. I recommend a tool called answerthepublic.com. It will help you find the exact questions. 2. Say the keyword multiple times in your video YouTube has built-in AI that\u2019s designed to hear you and it can also assess whether your topic matches the content that you've shared in the video. So it's best to give them what they want. Repeat the keyword and other matching keywords multiple times in the video. Don't overstuff the video but put it wherever it goes in the most natural and conversational way possible! 3. Drop the keyword in the first 30 seconds of the video It's important to let YouTube know that you're answering the question without the fluff. So drop the keyword in the beginning. This is good for the viewers too who get a confirmation that their search has brought them to the right result! 4. Optimize your title for search and let it open a curiousity gap Yes title is important. Not only will it help you get ranked on YouTube but it will also get you the clicks. So have 12\u201314 words in your title. Be sure to use the keyword here as well. Also, try to open an information gap. For example instead of saying: How to lose weight You should say: How to lose weight in 30 days without starving yourself to boredom So the 'without' hook opens an information gap. Now the reader wants to know the answer and that'll make them want to watch your video. 5. Embed the video on authoritative websites Firstly embed the video on your own website's blog. Next embed it on Quora, Reddit, other forums in your niche. Share it on Twitter, Facebook and other such platforms. Be sure to do it within 24\u201348 hours of publishing the video. That's when the impact of promotions activity the maximum! I hope my answr will help you get to the top of YouTube! Happy YouTubing! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi there, As a women who call myself pundit in social media, especially youtube marketing, I would like to focus on the \u201cgenuine way\u201d part of the question. Good question at first. There are some tried-and-true tips. Hope that can help you find your ways to work out this.  1. Give them quality and value There\u2019s no point in uploading videos just for the sake of uploading them. The videos must be quality, and their content should be of value to the viewers. 2. Videos should be consistently good and frequent  Make sure all the videos you upload are characterized by quality and value. Post videos frequently so that your viewers can expect something to be on the way soon. If you stick to a schedule, that\u2019s even better. This will get you some followers. Ray William Johnson brought out his Video Blogging channel on YouTube in 2007. His posting of 3 to 4 videos per week consistently made his one of the most familiar YouTube channels with in excess of 10.7 million subscribers and 2.5 billion views. 3. Optimize You have to think about the keyword applications of the title and description of your video. You may even want to go further by optimizing your channel name and channel page as well. Have a look at the tags in the most liked broadcast in your genre to see whether yours have been properly phrased. Hit on the keywords that your prospective viewers are utilizing in their searches. Hitting the correct keywords is particularly important with respect to the title of your videos which should also be attractive (not ordinary) and grab attention. Don\u2019t resort to spam tactics such as filling the description portion with keyword lists, which are a feature of the most dreadful videos. Spam could cost you a penalty. 4. Incorporate annotations YouTube has a wonderful feature that enables annotations to popup on a video. Annotations are a kind of link that appears on top of a video when it plays, and in the course of specific points as determined by the timestamp. Some of the applications of annotations are: \u25cfAs simple messages that inform people about updates to information present in the video; \u25cf To incorporate a call to action such as to get the viewer to subscribe; \u25cf To point the viewer to the like button; \u25cf To make people aware of free offers, product releases, upcoming tours and so on. Once you have created an annotation, you can personalize the color or font. You can make the annotation stand out or blend in. After that, you can select the points where you want the annotation to begin and end. If you would like the annotation just to come at the close of the video, you can make it begin at a later point in the video. If you would like it to cease at a particular point, you can get that done too. Even linking to your YouTube channel is possible. However fantastic a tool they may be, annotations should be utilized sparingly and chiefly for call-to-action links. The more they are utilized, the greater the probability of users switching them off completely. Try not to use annotations that cover the screen unless you have to modify the information on a whole-page slide of an old video.  5. Subscribe to other channels When you subscribe to other channels, the respective creators may feel like subscribing to your channel. 6. Start a playlist Playlists enable you to divide your videos into categories that provide a quick and easy reference for viewers. This is better than just uploading the videos one after the other in no particular category which makes it difficult for viewers to search for videos relating to specific topics (just like looking for a needle in a haystack). When a person is watching videos that appear in a playlist, it typically encourages him to check out more videos, thereby increasing the number of views. Another great benefit of playlists is that they showcase your knowledge of pertinency in your videos. You can create playlists with your content or else, introduce \u2018Featured Channels\u2019 in your existing channel. By linking to similar pertinent content, you establish yourself as a straight filter for your viewers, and you invite goodwill from those people who you feature. If the other featured content creators don\u2019t perceive the value of that gesture, all you have to do is tell them to feature your videos. The same applies to reviewing and commenting on other people\u2019s work. The more you involve yourself in the YouTube community, the more video creators and users begin to recognize you and what\u2019s unique about your videos. 7. Offer an incentive Establish some incentive that would make users want to subscribe. Make it publicly known what your present follower count is and the count you are aiming at, usually a sensible number greater than the current number. After that, chose something to do after the aim/goal is reached. Will you deliver more content and on a regular basis or will you be bringing out a special video? Would you be offering a gift to a lucky subscriber as soon as you accomplish your goal? Whatever you decide, you can encourage this kind of contest on other social media channels for additional benefit. Within no time, you\u2019ll have followers. 8. Reply to comments, interact with existing subscribers, top fans  Though it may appear to be a daunting task, try as best as you can to reply to all comments. You won\u2019t regret it. Not all people who post videos to YouTube do this so if you do, it would create a fantastic impression and develop a loyal viewer base. Loyal viewers comment, share and like which means more followers and/or subscribers for you. Also, make it a point to communicate with your existing subscribers and top fans. You can find out who your top fans are by visiting the Video Manager Dashboard. From this dashboard, you get to know which followers are associated with maximum interaction with your channel, and you. 9. Include a YouTube widget in your blog Provided you also have a blog or website, it\u2019s a great idea to guide your site\u2019s users to subscribe by way of incorporating a YouTube widget. The widget on your website or blog means that visitors can check out your channel (and hopefully subscribe to it too), with no need to leave the blog to do so. 10. Just ask (calls-to-action) A simple and straightforward way of getting people to subscribe is to ask them to. Just incorporate a call to action towards the video\u2019s close. This is common in popular videos. The culmination of the video is followed by 10 or more seconds where you are asked to like and subscribe. There is usually a box that takes you to some other video and an arrow pointing to the subscribe button. An effective call to action for your video\u2019s end would include: \u25cf What to do? Like the video and become a subscriber \u25cf How: Tell them about the buttons on video interface \u25cf Why: To see more videos from your channel 11. Buy YouTube Views Money talks, and one of its languages is buying views. While many consider this method shady, it\u2019s undeniably been one of the most popular ways to get more views on YouTube and going viral. Celebrities and big companies have been known to do it, so why can\u2019t you? There are thousands of different websites and companies that sell YouTube Views, but the cold hard fact is, most of them use bots or other cheap methods of acquiring fake views (the ones you need to avoid). There are some of companies, including BMP, which actually promote your videos to real people through websites and social media channels. Take a look at this company for a great start. They provide great service with good prices. ",

            "answer_text": "Okay, going over the answers I saw a lot of misinformation thrown your way and I am genuinely upset because this is so wrong. There are so many ways to get fast subs on YouTube, but none of them will actually benefit you long-term. The problem with fast subs is that they don\u2019t last. YouTube strictly forbids using sub4sub services and programs or inflating your subcount with bots and codes. So if anyone tells you that you can get an X amount of subscribers fast - they\u2019re scamming you and you\u2019re falling for it easily. With every channel the pace is different, obviously, but if there\u2019s one thing all YouTubers will tell you - is that getting subs is a process. You can\u2019t get over 1K subscribers overnight as a beginner (and sometimes even as a huge YouTuber). If you still insist on buying subscribers, make sure you\u2019re getting them from a reliable company. You\u2019ll want them to come in slowly and gradually, and not all at once. You\u2019ll want to make sure these subs are actual people with real accounts, and not fake bots generated by computer code. More importantly, you need to get some kind of guarantee from the company itself regarding what happens when people unsubscribe - will you get your money back? Will they refill those subscribers? Is there any policy you should know of? Do your homework. It\u2019s not something to take lightly. There are so many great article online about this topic, all you have to do is look it up and read everything very carefully. Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "Upload regularly In general, you want to upload as often as possible, without sacrificing quality.  So if you have the time and the tools to upload multiple videos a week, by all means, do it. But, if you start to notice a decline in quality, you'll soon see the audience drop. I recommend scheduling. Choose a realistic schedule for you, and keep in mind that you can always adjust how often you get used to the platform and types of content that appeal to your ideal audience. Make the entire opening no more than 5 seconds. Long attention. A long title or credit line at the beginning of the video can make people lose interest. In addition, a long opening does not encourage hinged tracking because people do not want to see the same long chain continuously. You may be inclined to include all information on your video, but great titles are short and accurate. Google truncated the page title to 66 characters, so anything except the title was cut off in the search results. Encourage discussion and engage with your audience in comments on YouTube It is extremely important to interact with your users in the comments section. Try to answer any comments you receive; This not only helps your videos interact, it will help you mold your community as you see fit. In addition, the more specific a user is engaged with your channel, the more likely it is that your video will include that video in their email and notifications. Use the right tool.  There are many great tools out there. From tools to help you create videos into a tool to help you promote your videos, using the right tools will help you grow your organic audience. And the more organic views you have, the more potential subscribers you'll get. For me, I've been using Boost Socials for a while and I recommend using it for anyone serious about marketing on YouTube. Use annotations to add a call-to-action You can make a clickable call to action on your video by adding a caption. To add captions to your video, just go to Video Manager and click Annotations from the menu under Edit. Enter the call-to-action you want. Keep it short, but urgent. Use the tools to make the size annotation you want. It should not exceed 30 percent of the video. Select the start and end time for captions to come in and out. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello, well to answer your question there are three ways! (That I am aware of)These will take time and it isn't really gonna happen overnight! First way: Websites like, Subpals, allow you to subscribe to people and they will subscribe back! This does actually work but I wouldn't recommend It because you basically give this company your YouTube Channel due to the fact that you allow them permissions to manage your YouTube Channel when you sign up. Second way: Make Videos! It is that easy! Don\u2019t make really bad videos with no effort! Put time and effort into your videos and make sure you are happy with the result! People subscribe because they like someones content they post. Posting videos like GTA V and Minecraft (and other popular games) on your channel will probably get you more subscribers than posting videos of like: Meditation Music (no hate). This is because YouTube fans are made up of a lot of kids and teens who love gaming! Third way: Tell your friends! This is a really fast way of getting Subscribers! Your friends will probably subscribe to you and If they do tell them to tell there friends! Promote your channel around school by telling others! Hope this helps and you get more subscribers! ",

            "answer_text": "All right so here is a little guide: Make sure your YouTube channel is built around one theme. Don\u2019t upload gameplays, guides around barbecue and Barbie reviews on one channel. If you upload gameplays, only upload content that has to do with gaming, you get me?Now when you have focused your channel on one specific theme, try to upload on a daily/weekly basis and when you have uploaded your video. Try and make your videos better and better. Watch it again and see where you can make improvements the next time. Maybe it\u2019s an idea to let your best friend/brother/sister watch the video and ask them what you could have done better.When you have uploaded about 5 to 10 video\u2019s which have good quality in your eyes, try to reach out to other YouTubers. When you have 50 subscribers try to reach out to YouTubers between the 25\u201375 subscribers. Remember that this YouTuber needs to have the same theme on their channel as you do. Maybe the most important question that you can ask yourself about this YouTuber is: Does he have potential and do I actually like his video\u2019s? If your answer is yes, then he is a perfect person to collaborate with. Just comment and like his videos for 3 days. After those 3 days you can reach out to them and say that you got a channel on your own and if they are maybe interested in collaborating. Maybe you both could make one video for each other\u2019s channel? Maybe you both could play a game together and upload it on both your channel? There are infinite ways to collaborate.Interfere with your viewers. If they ask a question in the comment section, answer it, if they compliment you, answer with a \u201cthank you\u201d. Liking their posts is a great idea too. Through this way, you show your viewers that you care more about them and less about the views you get from them.Now just try to upload consistent for a month. If your subscribers count hasn\u2019t doubled yet, try to toolkit critical at your product, is it really good or do you think it\u2019s good? A good YouTuber always gets subscribers and views.Hope I helped you out! ",

Calling subscribe in video Please subscribe to your channel in the video 3 times to get the most effect: 1st time after intro. Last 2 finished video content. Last 3 outro if available. Regularly edit your video Make regular edits to your YouTube video and choose the perfect one for upload. A sloppy video will greatly affect the image of your brand / personality.

When users search on Google, YouTube for certain keywords to find content, here we will consider that content is the video and users find on YouTube. There are keywords that tens of thousands of searches per month, and when you set the title for the video under these keywords, you have completed a small step in SEO, more precisely a small section of SEO on page. Collaborate, link to the same topic Look for partners to collaborate links between channels, the same topic video, mutual benefit. If you link my video from your video, then I will also be willing to give you links that will direct my viewers to your video. ",

            "answer_text": "You will need to create content that can add value to the viewer or atleast give him a reason to come back to your channel. Someone who will subscribe you will always look for a WIFM( Whats In It For Me ). Unless there is something of interest for a viewer, he might not even hold on to your video forget subscription. Also you need to ask viewers to subscribe to your channel not because they should never miss an update \u2026 This gimmick does not always work as the viewer decides which update he do not want to miss and what holds value for him. I cant just say to viewers that hi, subscribe to my channel because its going to add value and you dont want to miss my future video( leave this to the viewer) What you realy need to ask viewers to do is to tell them to subscribe because it will help you as a youtuber and will further motivate you to keep making creative content.( be honest and people may feel the need to support you by subscribing) Also a Fact that you need be aware about is- people dont susbcribe because they dont wana get bugged by notifications and email about each of your update. So you will see even if someone with 1 M subscribers on youtube get only 200k views initially even in a couple of weeks due to the fact that not everyone who susbcribe hits the bell icon. I think if you set correct expectation with your viewers and tell them the difference between the bell icon and subscribtion. The difference is Subs Means support , and people who hit bell icon is someone who realy find you and ur content intresting and worthy to watch and follow. NOW thats 10 % of the subscribers for many youtubers. My advise - start telling people to subscribe to support you and also hit the bell icon if they find you worthy to be bugged with notifications on their phone and email. You will start getting subs who do not have much time to watch all ur content but want to support you if you will ask them to on ur video. If you make this clear , you will start getting a down pour you might not had thought about. Happy youtubing ! ",

            "answer_text": "I know you're young and you still need some experience and you don't have access to buying decent equipment- but I would definitely save up for a better camera. People do like good quality YouTube videos, it doesn't have to be the best, but you should try and find something with a little more better quality than what you have.   As for the vlogs, I would look into learning how to edit videos. Every version of Windows from XP to 8.1 come with something called Windows Movie Maker or Windows Live Movie Maker. Macs come with something called iMovie. Both of these programs are free basic editing programs so that you can trim out some of the \"fat\" in your current videos. Have you ever seen a YouTuber vlog where one second they are talking about something, then it \"jumps\" and they are in a different position suddenly talking about something else? It's straight to the point and it cuts out a lot of silence or \"ums\" which means viewers are going to be more entertained- believe me, you want to keep your viewers entertained so that they will keep coming back and they will spread the word about your channel.   The majority of YouTube unfortunately does come down to luck though. It usually seems to come down to right time right place for views and subscribers- but you have to be passionate about it and keep uploading videos even if you are sick of hardly getting any views... because eventually if you keep at it; your channel will explode and you will get the views and the subscribers that you want. I swear it's the first 100-200 subscribers to earn that is the hardest time for a channel to get recognized- after that, it does get easier.   But my advice for your videos: Save up for a webcam or video camera with better quality- it doesn't need to be the best, but it should be better than what you are already using to record your videos with now. I would look into Windows Movie Maker and learn how to trim the \"fat\" off of your videos. Give your videos something to talk about instead of how your day was- do news events, be exciting and energetic, not awkward and silent. Engage with your viewers- when people leave a comment; comment back. If they have any criticism to give you- take it with a grain of salt and use that criticism to get better and improve your overall quality- thus giving you more viewers and subscribers in the long run. hope this will help you Upvote dreamer.!!!

In fact, it\u2019s about not using YouTube. YouTube can still be a good place to get attention, and of all the video-sharing platforms, it has the most users by far. However, there are tons of people on it already, and newcomers tend to have more difficult times competing with established names than they used to have. Also, various bad decisions on YouTube\u2019s part have made being an up-and-coming creator more annoying than ever. If you want to get an audience, try making alternate accounts on other sites. The ones I have in mind are Vidme and BitChute. Both are growing and have active users, but there are less people to compete against, and they\u2019re generally better for the creators. BitChute is currently dominated by people with unorthodox political opinions because it\u2019s set up so that controversial opinions cannot be censored, but you can put any type of content there. In fact, if it became another YouTube while retaining its less controlled nature, that would legitimize it. Vidme is basically like a less restricted YouTube alternative with the flavor of early YouTube and some extra touches. I think both of these platforms are worth considering, even if YouTube is still your main platform. ",

            "answer_text": "Can you imagine to start a YouTube Channel without any content or without any videos and still expect people to subscribe? Well, you would call me mad if I tried that, won\u2019t you? But in reality I did start a YouTube Channel without any videos and without any content and still people did subscribe to my channel. Yes you read it right. There are more than 100 Answers to this question but still I want to write one more because I believe the single most important thing to get YouTube subscribers is your Credibility. If people know you for who you are, if they trust you, if they believe in what you say, if they like the content you publish they will definitely follow You. Presentation skills, video quality and audio quality all become secondary. SEO and marketing are important but not as important as your Credibility. People want to listen to someone whom they can trust. People want to follow someone who is publishing good content, useful content. If you focus too much on SEO and marketing but less on credibility and content then even if people follow you they will chose to unsubscribe at any time in future. If you do not produce quality content regularly people will chose to leave. Here is what you can do with your credibility: If you are a good teacher. Publish videos about teaching your subject. Because people trust you as a teacher in real life they will follow your channel too.If you are a good looking model. Publish videos on beauty and beauty products or lifestyle. People will trust you because you are already a good looking model in real life.If you are a parent and you can share tips on parenting then create a channel and share your experiences and tips on parenting. People will trust you and follow you because you are a parent in real and you speak by your experience.Let me share my example. Here is the link of my upcoming channel which I created without any content or videos. People follow this channel => Career Tips because they know that I have more than 6m content views on Quora, I have written more than 250+ answers on career advice and I have professional experience of over 15 years. They follow my channel because of the credibility and trust that I have built over the years. They know that if they subscribe they will get good quality and relevant content from me. This would have not been possible if I had chosen to start a channel on beauty tips or science or health and medicine.In summary, do not try to be someone else, do not try to create videos on topics which are not your area of strength. Use your real life credibility to create great quality content and people will follow you automatically. Hope this helps. ",

(But believe me, you will never get real subscribers, means the people subscribed you will never gonna watch your videos they may be other YouTubers like you or they may be normal people, fake account or anything else)Real way to get subscribers (I personally follow)-Create a channel with a good name that people can remember.Create same name account on all social platform.Upload video consistently on your channel, at least 2\u20133 videos in a week.Engage with viewers in video (ask opinion, queries etc)Make quality content (don't worry if you don't have good camera or mic or anything else, your content must be unique and informative)First 15 sec of your videos play very important role (so grab viewers in this first 15 sec)Use proper youtube tags.Make videos on trending topics.Learn using videos editing tools like Adobe, Camtasia etc that helps a lot.You should always have 10\u201315 ideas or topic ready for next videos.Before creating channel find in which thing you are best and make a channel around the same.

            "answer_text": "I am going to share 10 Tips on How to Increase YouTube Subscribers and grow on YouTube I have learned all this from a professional courseTube Mastery and Monetization and would love to share a bit of it.  1. SEO your video SEO is not just limited for Google, but you need to do SEO for the video by incorporating keywords in the video title and description. Make sure that they are search engine optimized. If you are creating a video on how to make Italian pasta, then you need to have the keywords that people usually search for this. Keep your description detailed and include the links to your social media accounts. 2. Use an appropriate thumbnail It is important to use a suitable thumbnail instead of using an over the top sensational thumbnail. The thumbnails which are misleading are completely against YouTube\u2019s terms and conditions. The thumbnail is such that it informs people what the video is all about so that they can confidently click on it and watch it. A good and apt thumbnail is important to encourage people to watch the video. YouTube already has this default system where it automatically chooses 3 images which are apt as a thumbnail for your video. But then you can also create your own thumbnail and upload it. 3. Consistency is the key In order to get a good amount of views, you need to be absolutely consistent with your videos. You need to keep on posting at regular intervals. It will not do if you are uploading one video and then the next video after two months. You have to make sure that you are posting twice a week. For this, you need to make a proper video schedule so that people are aware of the fact that you are regular with uploading videos. 4. Focus on the trending topics This is a great way to attract more views to your videos on YouTube. Make videos on the content which is already viral. I am not saying that copy it from someone. What I am trying to say is that create content that can be linked to your brand. So you need to be really clever with the theme. For example, if you are a bike manufacturer and looking to make a video on Independence Day, then you need to connect independence with your brand so that you will get more views for your unique content. This is the job of your marketing team to create content. 5. Have the inclusion of CTA There are people who subscribe to your channel without you even asking for it. But then for those who like your videos but forget to subscribe to your channel, you can put a call-to-action of subscribing button at the end of the video. You can also put the CTA of watch next video. You need to explain to the audience as to how your channel is going to benefit them. 6. Make use of Facebook - It may do the Magic Facebook is the world\u2019s largest social media platform. You must connect your Facebook account with your YouTube channel in order to have further engagement and discussion on your video. Facebook is also useful for reaching out to your subscribers when they are not active on YouTube. You can post the video as an embedded video to generate more views. 7. Twitter has a lot of power Twitter is a platform where you can keep the conversations moving related to your area of concern. Since Twitter heavily works on the hashtag, you can research on a hashtag which is popular and make a video related to that. Whatever Tweets that you are putting on Twitter must contain relevant hashtags so that the audience is driven towards it. 8. Create End screens It is really important to have end screens to your videos. YouTubers know what importance the \u201cEnd Screens\u201d hold in their lives. Those last 5-20 seconds are very crucial where the YouTubers can add that extra piece of information to promote their content orthe channel or website. So basically, we can say that End screens are a kind of lifeline for the YouTubers and the best part is that, it is mobile friendly, which means, it becomes simple for the viewer to take the next move before the video ends and thus, this end screen keeps the viewer go with the flow! 9. Create a supporting blog for your channel You are producing video content for your brand. So I would suggest you have a blog that will support your video content. You have a website, so you must publish blogs on it so that you can embed the YouTube videos in your blog and get more views. YouTube keeps on changing its policies so it is better to have your own place which is in your control. 10. Create playlists Create playlists for your content so viewers can watch it consecutively. After the first video ends, your other videos will automatically play, which will get more views for each played video without them having to navigate off the player. You can embed playlists, post them in your channel, or have users share them to increase the total views for each playlist. So if you follow these tips you will automatically start getting a good amount of views on your YouTube videos. Just keep calm and keep doing your work. Finally, I would give credits to Matt. I joined a course Tube Mastery and Monetization which cost some money but I made 10\u00d7 more money from YouTube through this course. I would recommend you to enroll for this course if you actually are committed to grow on YouTube. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s no denying it; video marketing has been on the rise over the past few years, growing ever more popular and accessible for brands. And while popular sites such as SnapChat, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and even your own website are great places to invest, YouTube remains the giant in the space, with individuals spending a billion hours each day watching videos on this platform. Often referred to as the world\u2019s \u201csecond largest search engine,\u201d YouTube can help your content be found quickly and engaged with thoroughly - if you know a few tricks. Here are 10 effective ways you can grow your YouTube channel. 1. Build Videos Around a Single Keyword/Topic It may seem obvious, but building your video around a single topic/keyword is the best way to get the traffic you want and grow your audience. Many people who are unaware of SEO best practices skip this step, but it\u2019s crucial if you want your videos to get the maximum amount of viewers. Try using a keyword tool like KeywordTool.io, which is specific to YouTube, to look for the most searched keywords in the niche you\u2019re looking to target. It\u2019s important to pick your keyword before you even build your video content because it helps you construct the best information around that specific topic. It also helps you remember to include your keyword naturally throughout the content so YouTube picks it up when closed captions are added. Once you\u2019ve chosen your keyword, check out the videos that are currently ranking for that topic to make sure you\u2019re on the right track in terms of intent, and don\u2019t forget to optimize your title and descriptions. Despite popular myths, the most successful videos on YouTube are typically less than 5 minutes long, so don\u2019t feel you have to make a film or write a novel. Keep it short and sweet. 2. Reformat Existing Quality Content Of course, the easiest way to grow your channel is to build great content. But that content doesn\u2019t always have to be built from scratch. Some of your best videos can be built from engaging, valuable, useful and actionable content you\u2019ve already created. Many people go to YouTube to find answers and how-to tutorials for the issues they\u2019re facing, so content that solves problems is a great fit. Look at the blogs, guides, and other high-performing pieces you currently have and think about how to make them into cool videos.  3. Engage with Your Audience It's important not to overlook the fact that YouTube is a social media channel, and therefore demands social interaction. If you\u2019re just posting videos without encouraging comments and discussion, you\u2019re missing a trick. YouTube rewards channels with great engagement, including overall time spent on channel, watch time, likes and dislikes, and most importantly, comments. Try to respond to every comment you receive (if possible!) and ask users to engage with audio/visual prompts. 4. Get Branded So your content is great. But is your channel itself visually appealing? If you want visitors to take your YouTube channel seriously and subscribe to your channel, you need to look professional. Branding your channel will also help users immediately recognize your content. If you have a blog or website, you probably already have some sort of look and feel you use to differentiate yourself from other individuals and/or companies, so it only makes sense to carry over that branding to your YouTube channel as well. Here\u2019s an example from fashion brand ModCloth. In addition to visual branding, don\u2019t forget to add custom URLs to your channel header - and to write an interesting bio about who you are and what your videos are about. 5. Promote Your YouTube Videos on Other Social Channels One of the beautiful things about social media is that you can cross-promote content on different channels. Promoting your YouTube videos on your other social channels is the easiest way to grow your audience. What channels are you on? Facebook, Linkedin, Instagram, Pinterest? There are many from which to choose. And if there\u2019s a channel (such as Facebook) on which you want to post videos directly, you can always do a teaser for the full-length video on YouTube so that you have optimum engagement on all channels. Don\u2019t forget about your blog; you can post your videos there as well! 6. Show Up If you\u2019re running YouTube by yourself or as part of a small organization, it can be extremely beneficial to put your own face on screen. When you put a face to a brand, your audience can more easily connect with you as an individual. This is especially important for bloggers; fitness, life, or business coaches; and solopreneurs. Every video you make doesn\u2019t need to include your face, but you should reach out personally to your audience every few videos or so. Additionally, if you are this type of YouTuber, use a photo of yourself on your channel (not your logo). See the example still from marketing guru Adam Erhart below 7. Post Great Thumbnails They may seem like a small thing (because they are), but thumbnails can have a big impact. YouTube advertises other videos via thumbnail in its sidebar, so you want yours to stand out among the pack. The same goes for YouTube search. Videos with a catchy title and appealing thumbnail usually rank higher, even if the content itself isn\u2019t as valuable, because they have a higher click-through-rate (CTR). To get your CTR where it needs to be, try using tactics such as highlighted areas, arrows, large text, and unexpected or unusual images. See the example below from Neil Patel. 8. Leverage YouTube Cards We\u2019ve already discussed the fact that YouTube rewards channels that keep viewers on their pages longer. These longer average watch times mean people are truly engaged with your content. (You can see how long people are staying on your videos by using YouTube analytics). By adding YouTube cards, you can add additional recommended videos at the exact point where users are currently dropping off. Though they may abandon that video, users will be taken to your other content and stay on your channel, increasing your channel\u2019s ranking. 9. Push for Subscriptions One of the ways you know for sure that viewers are engaged with your channel is when they \u201csubscribe\u2019 to see any new videos that are posted. Ask viewers to subscribe to your channel in each video that you upload, and keep engaged with your existing subscribed users. (You can see your list of subscribers, here). Never pay for subscribers. This will only bring down your engagement and hurt the authenticity of your account in the long run. Remember, if you don\u2019t ask your viewers to subscribe, you may be missing out on a lot of potential followers. 10. Increase Your Uploading Frequency This tip may sound intimidating at first, but to grow your audience, you need to increase your posting frequency to at least one video a week. Don\u2019t worry; you don\u2019t need a design firm or fancy advertising budget to get this done. Today\u2019s smartphones offer excellent video recording ability, and tools such as Animoto make editing videos easy for anyone. Consistency is of the utmost importance. Try to post at the same time each day or week (depending on your frequency), and keep your subscribers updated about when new videos will arrive. Then stick to your schedule. Remember, driving engagement with quality content is what develops engaged followers and subsequently. advocators of your brand! Be true to yourself and your brand, and communicate with your audience along the way. And also if you want to grow any type of Digital Business and any thing online i would highly recommend you to read \u201cCrush It!\u201d from the finest social media personality GaryVee.  thanks! ",

            "answer_text": "What you could do to get noticed is, look for someone that has the same, or similar topic of video's you have and ask for them to promote you. Your channel can't be an almost exact copy of theirs, because they won't like being copied. Send them a message with a link to one of your videos as an example of what you do. You could even make a video specifically to ask to be promoted. That's how to be discovered.      To make people interested in you, you have to be unique. Do at least one thing no one has thought of to get people to turn their attention towards you. Think of a topic for a video, search for it and see if anyone has already done it. If you do find it, take a look at how they did it and do it better.      Be responsive to the audience's comments. In the beginning, you'll be able to respond to most, if not all questions and comments. When you get a large audience, you won't be able to respond to everyone but get to as many people as possible.      Upload frequency depends on video length. Be consistent with your uploads, people like regularity. If your video's are 2-7 minutes long, you should be uploading maybe twice a week (with the exception of writing original music). 7-15 minute videos could be uploaded around once a week. Try not to make videos over 20 minutes long, because people lose interest and don't watch them all the way through, resulting in working for nothing.      One trick to get people to watch all the way through is to add something funny at the end of each video after an ending speech/credit/scene. Something like a blooper or funny moment. One YouTuber that does this M3RKMUS1C.      Even if you do all of this, there is still a very slim chance of becoming as successful as any of the major YouTubers, but keep at it, and don't be affected by the hater's comments. The worst thing you could do is feed the trolls. ",

Actively upload regularly  You must constantly nurture your subscribers with top-of-the-line videos. More videos mean more sales from your channel.

Use more than one WORD tag Keywords / Keywords are confusing in YouTube, but SIMPLE RULES can completely change your ability to rank in YouTube even if you have a small YouTube Channel. YouTube does not fully rate videos based on the number of subscribers or their views. Think about what someone would type in YouTube or Google Search if they were actually looking for this video. Use the right tool. For me, I've been using a reputable provider for some time and I recommend using it for anyone serious about marketing on YouTube. There are hundreds of providers out there offering this type of service, but you should know that some providers are more reputable than others. ",

Well You can legally by YouTube Discovery Ads, I have mentioned this many times but these type of ads show up as a regular video with thumbnails in the video suggestion. If your video is on training dogs then as a discovery YouTube Ad when people search on training dogs, your sponsor ad will show up on top. If your video has a good thumbnail, you will have a good click through rate. And if you got a good hook at the beginning of your video to keep them engaged, you possibility gain a subscriber. You can get good views and subscribers when you target other countries besides the Top 5 countries United States, Canada, Australia, United kingdom, New Zealand. Many missed out when you just target English. There are third party companies like promo, instant views and I have seen get fans which is not bad getting views and subscribers that stay and do not leave. Make sure you do your homework and read the reviews on third party companies to promote your channel. Organic can take sometime to grow your channel but still possible. To Your Success ",

            "answer_text": "There are a few ways to do this, all of which require time and effort. a) Upload all the time. It could be daily or weekly or monthly. When you do post, upload similar content, and watch your views. If you posting gaming videos gets more views than vlogs, post more gaming. b) I know this sounds dumb, but hop onto a trend, and advertise. Begin to upload content an anything people might be into. For example, you could post Fortnite videos, or Minecraft, or slime, anything that is trendy or popular. Then, go onto other videos and simply advertise. c) Even though I just said to post videos that are trendy, you still need break away from the average YouTuber. You need to convince the people that decided to watch your videos why they should stay and subscribe. You need to show people that you can still post trendy content with your own, original twist to it. Here is an example - Bobby Bojangles. Yes, he isn't the largest Fortnite YouTuber out there, but the kind of content he makes made him different than the rest. By him posting actual, fun challenges in the game, and by him actually being good at it, made his content fun to watch. Had he not made this different style of content, he could have easily been just like any other Fortnite YouTuber. Hope this helps :) ",

I know that you will have a 'break down moment' but, you have to remember your main goal, and it will give you more energy to move forward. First, make your videos in the most unique way that you can. People will get bored if you make your video like any other YouTubers out there, so, think about things that you never saw before on youtube. Second, use a camera that is filming in a high-quality, I mean, who likes to watch a video that taken on phone camera? (no one right?). Third, don't make long videos. People love to see videos that will answer exactly about what they look for. I mean, if you upload a video that takes 20 minutes about 'how to make a pasta', people may lose interest and search another video that explains the same thing but, takes 3 minutes. Another way, you can buy subscribers, it's the quickest way you can get your subscribers and is totally legal (You don't have to worry about it). These days there is a lot of providers on the market so you can check them out, but you have to know that there is a lot of rogue people out there that want to take your money and provide you with fake subscribers (which means- the subs number drop after a few hours/minutes). You can talk with your friend or search online more about it (I use GetFans.io. services). That's it, hope I help you and I wish you will have a lot of subscribers!  ",

That YouTube spent 1:20 minutes reviewing my YouTube channel. The experience was the most effective as I took his suggestions to heart and started executing them. The funny thing, these were the same ideas that I had heard before. They weren\u2019t anything new. It was the experience of having my YouTube channel reviewed by someone else, a \u201cYouTube consultant\u201d if you will, that made me jump into action with the same ideas I had heard before. That is the best way to get more YouTube subscribers. Get your YouTube channel viewed by outside \u201ceyes\u201d just as corporation hire consultants.  ",

            "answer_text": "Here are some ways you can do just that. 1. Create a \"channel trailer\" Many YouTube channels show a channel trailer at the top of their page that autoplays when visitors check them out. Create a \u201ctrailer\u201d video of your own that you can show to unsubscribed visitors on your page to quickly tell them what to expect from you. The benefit of creating a unique trailer for this spot is that you can stitch together footage from your past videos or deliver your \u201cpitch\u201d directly to your audience and ask them to subscribe. Here's a great example from How to Cake It that conveys the channel's focus (making cake), tone (having fun with cake), and personality (passionate about cake). 2. Come up with a pitch for your YouTube channel An elevator pitch is an often underestimated tool that\u2019s relevant to all self-starters, whether you\u2019re an entrepreneur, a freelancer, or a creator.  And YouTubers are no exception. This pitch can be used in your About section, your intro, your closing, or wherever you need to quickly communicate what your channel is about. Most YouTubers already end their videos by saying something along the lines of, \u201cIf you liked this video, please hit the thumbs up, leave a comment, and subscribe.\u201d But this call to action can be enhanced by creating an outro that speaks to the content that\u2019s to come rather than what viewers just watched. Your pitch can be as simple as: I post [videos you post] every [when you post] or a teaser for what's next. These couple of seconds capture the essence of your channel's content in a way that gives new viewers a reason to hit that subscribe button. 3. Buy Youtube views to kickstart your Youtube channels Consumers are naturally attracted to content that has been shared with them or they have heard about from another source. When a person finds your video, the more views that it has, the more likely your audience is to watch it and listen to its message with an open mind. This goes hand in hand with developing a reputation as a producer of valuable content, since your credibility will largely be a factor of your popularity. This boost in your credibility is invaluable when it comes to increasing sales stemming from your video.  If you are looking for a website to Buy Youtube Views, I confidently recommend for you This One. I\u2019ve been working with them for many times and just realize some factors: Quality of Views \u2013 AG provide high-quality followers. Their followers are all look real, which have profile pictures, some videos and active. Turnaround Time \u2013 They deliver the goods on time. Often within 1-2 hours after customer ordered. Customer Service \u2013 Their staffs are very helpful, friendly and they answer all question thoroughoutly. Money Back Guarantee \u2013 This is arguably the biggest factor. If a company doesn\u2019t offer a good refund policy, then they don\u2019t deserve our recommendation. Thanks God, all packages of AG are covered with 100% money back guarantee to keep you in safe. 4. Collaborate with other YouTubers with similar audiences Collaborations aren\u2019t uncommon on YouTube and are a great way to get exposure to a whole new audience. You can reach out to a YouTuber you know or would like to partner with and suggest an idea for cross-promotion. A common approach is to have your proposed partner appear in one of your videos and vice versa, each of you getting an endorsement in front of the other creator\u2019s audience.  Here\u2019s an example of when Sean Evans of Hot Ones interviewed Harley Morenstein of Epic Meal Time over hot wings. Sean then appeared on Epic Meal Time to cook up the spiciest ribs ever. Both channels are about taking food to the next level and both entertain you in similar ways\u2014it's a match made in heaven. ",

By that way, you will utilize the friend list in other social media platforms such as Facebook or Instagram. If you are a hot face on Facebook, but your Youtube is boring, it is a regrettable thing. Besides, did you see any link of other videos whenever you finish watching a video? It also is a type of crossing video links strategy. By that way, you can recommend viewer to view your video continuously. Hence, you will have more view number easily. ",

That\u2019s equivalent to 8.4 minutes per day per human! With its widespread popularity, it\u2019s hard for marketers to ignore the video marketing channel. But with such high popularity comes high competition. The channel is crowded with an endless library of video content, so how can you stand out? We\u2019ve all caught ourselves binge watching hours upon hours of cat videos. There is nothing to be ashamed of! The question is, how can marketers steal attention away from these famous cats to get more eyes on their own YouTube channels? This is just what this article aims to provide for you \u2013 because if you\u2019ve spent the time to invest in video then not only do you want a return, you need a return! It\u2019s time to grow your channel\u2019s subscribers through some strategic work. Here are 12 tips to grow your YouTube subscribers, fast! #1: Clean Up Your YouTube Channel Before we get into the good stuff, it is important to do some housekeeping. While you may think everything your business does is flawless, you are not Beyonc\u00e9, so your audience might not think so... I know, I know, it\u2019s hard to swallow, but it\u2019s important to step away from your self and into the shoes of an outsider from time to time. Taking a hard look at your YouTube channel and re-evaluating what is on there will likely lead to the realization that a chunk of old content should be deleted\u2014whether it is outdated, poorly produced, or just a flop of a video that should have never made it up there in the first place. If you have something of this nature tied to your brand, it\u2019s going to immediately turn that lead off, and cause them to lose trust in your brand. Delete it and never look back! This brings me to my next tip\u2026 #2: Only Create and Post Highly Watchable Content Yes, I know this tip might seem obvious, but YouTube is full of clutter, so it\u2019s easy to feel like you can get away with posting sub-par content. Well, you can\u2019t! The only way to really stand out from the pack and grow your subscriber base is to create the best of the best content in your space. The key to accomplishing this is planning during pre-production. Here are a few ways you can do this better then your competition: Do Your Research Watch your competitors\u2019 videos, as well as videos in industries outside of yours, and jot down notes of the most intriguing parts. Rather then copying what your competition is doing, find a more creative way to do it better. For example, if I was in the gum business (or any other business for that matter) I\u2019d probably take a tip or two from my all time favorite YouTube commercial, The Story of Sarah and Juan. Check it out, and just try and tell me this didn\u2019t make you cry. It is pretty obvious what is so wonderful about this commercial: the ability it has to elicit powerful emotions. How could your company do this? Script ahead You might think you can wing it on screen. Well, you can\u2014but you shouldn\u2019t. You need to plan out your script, do a table read, rewrite it, table read, and rewrite it again. This process improves your script to make it take on the story you\u2019re trying to convey in the most powerful way. Businesses often underutilize the power of scripting, but mastering this art can take your videos to an entirely new level. Purchase the right equipment for an in-house studio What is the \u201cright\u201d equipment? And can you afford it? This answer to the latter question is yes! Shockingly enough, the camera isn\u2019t your most important piece of equipment. Why? Well, nowadays the camera on your iPhone is close in quality to a much more expensive alternative. If you are shooting in-house, the most important equipment to have is a simple background, studio lights, and a tripod. Yes, there are a few other things you might need depending on the video, like props and audio equipment, but nailing down some of the basics and creating a solid in-office studio will lead to better video creation. Make the first 10 seconds of your video the most memorable Did you know that a whopping 20 percent of viewers drop off within the first 10 seconds of your video? This is why you need to make the most of the first few seconds. (PS: If you're looking for more YouTube stats, we've got you covered.) To make an awesome first impression, don\u2019t start your video with a bland introduction, but rather with the most climactic part of your video. If you start with a bang viewers aren\u2019t going to want to leave. #3: Execute Top-Notch Channel Trailers YouTube has this beautiful feature for marketers looking to grow their subscription base, called channel trailers. These are just as they sound, short trailers that automatically play when a visitor arrives on your YouTube channel page. This is the perfect opportunity to build your subscription base, if, and only if, you create insanely compelling content. These trailers need to be short (30-60 seconds), compelling, and most importantly they need to give your visitors a reason to stay. Do they need to be hilarious, beautiful, and emotionally charged? It will definitely help! What I really can\u2019t stress enough is the need for an impactful call-to-action that gives the viewer a reason to subscribe. Check out this awesome example from SoulPancake. Not only is the trailer the perfect length, it provokes motivational emotions, comedy, and ends with a very creative call-to-action. #4: Make Sure Your Videos Are Under 5 Minutes So, your videos are all 30-60 minutes because your digital engineering software is complicated to explain? Or perhaps you\u2019re in the law industry and believe the only way to instill trust is to include long video testimonials on your channel? While testimonials are great, long videos and YouTube do not go well together! Regardless of how complicated the product you\u2019re marketing is, your videos should never exceed 5 minutes. Why? Well, science. Study after study proves that online video viewers have a short attention span. I mean, did you forget earlier when I told you how 20 percent of viewers drop off within the first 10 seconds? In fact, HubSpot has found that the ideal length for videos on YouTube is a nice and concise 2 minutes. So re-edit those long webinars, and turn them into short, snappy clips. If you feel like you can\u2019t cut down your content, the tip below will definitely come in handy! #5: Turn a Set of Videos into a Binge-Worthy Playlist Do you have a set of videos that go together? Perhaps you do a recurring weekly educational series, or you have a set of webinars around the same theme? Whatever it is, you should make that grouping into a YouTube playlist. This will allow your viewers to continue watching without having to manually search for and click into the next video. Why is this good for subscription growth? Well, it will keep people on your channel longer, and show them that you have a plethora of quality content. This will also keep your video content highly organized so your channel doesn\u2019t become a cluttered mess that turns users away. BuzzFeed Tasty does an awesome job at this. Check out their YouTube playlist page, which is grouped by different categories like, \u201cDinner,\u201d \u201cVegetarian,\u201d and my personal favorite because I despise dishes, \u201cOne-Pot Recipes.\u201d #6: Add Powerful CTA\u2019s Into Your Videos All good marketers know how to create powerful calls-to-action, or CTA\u2019s. So why not use these skills of yours to give users a reason to return to your channel through a subscribe-able call-to-action? How does this work exactly? If the idea of inserting a CTA into a video sounds complicated, and possibly above your technical capabilities, I\u2019ve got good news: It\u2019s not! YouTube has made this easy by allowing marketers to add end screens and cards into their videos. Let me break down these two options a bit further: End Screens: An end screen is just what it sounds like, a screen where a call-to-action will appear are the end of your video. Whether you want to encourage viewers to subscribe, point them to the next video, or even promote your website or crowdfunding campaign, you can do all of these things with end cards. End screens allow you to choose from four different elements depending on your goal. You can even have multiple elements per end-screen (like in the image below). End cards can appear during the last 5-20 seconds of your video, which must be at least 25 seconds long. Check out this link to learn more about end screens. Cards: If end screens aren\u2019t your thing, check out YouTube cards! These babies allow you to add more interactivity during your video, whether it\u2019s pointing viewers to a specific URL, showing a video or playlist, promoting your channel, or even polling your audience. #7: Create Custom Human Thumbnails Let\u2019s face it, the reason we\u2019re warned not to judge a book by its cover is because we do it all the time. Your video thumbnail is essentially the cover of your video, so you need it to be absolutely beyond engaging. In fact, I\u2019d argue that the video thumbnail is the most critical item determining whether or not a visitor is going to play or not play your video. The greatest way to ensure people play your video is by using an image of a smiling human making direct eye-contact as the thumbnail for your video. Why? People relate to other people. Another hot tip to take your thumbnail to the next level \u2013 throw a smile on it! #8: Post Often and Consistently Yes, I understand this might be hard to fathom at first. Not every marketing team has a full-time videographer to be grinding out content after all. Luckily, if you followed my advice in Tip #2 about building an in-house studio, scripting and creating well-done videos can easily become part of your weekly workflow. Consistency is key, because subscribers are not going to stay subscribed if you never update your channel or if you update 4 times in one week and then take a month-long hiatus. If you\u2019re at all into SEO, you have likely heard of Moz. Moz does a great series called Whiteboard Fridays, with a weekly video that breaks down some SEO concept on a crisp whiteboard. Not only are these videos super-engaging and well produced, but they\u2019re CONSISTENT. They are called Whiteboard Fridaysfor a reason. If you can nail down a re-occurring series like this, you\u2019ll be golden for providing your subscribers consistent video content, leading you not only to keep current subscribers, but also attract new subscribers and increase video engagement. #9: Invest in YouTube Advertising The time has come to take your wallet out. You didn\u2019t think all of these tips would be free of charge, did you? Take a deep breath, I\u2019m not asking you to shell out too much cash, but putting some budget behind promoting your YouTube channel is a pretty full-proof way of increasing your subscription base. The internet is a crowded space, and money talks, so it\u2019s important to invest some of your marketing budget behind your channel. YouTube makes advertising your channel very customizable with a variety of ad formats, including: Display adsOverlay adsSkippable and non-skippable video adsBumper adsSponsored cardsSimilar to platforms like Facebook and Twitter, YouTube also allows for video targeting based on interest, demographics, and/or in-market audiences. #10: Promote your Channel to Relevant Online Communities Whether it be a Twitter chat, LinkedIn group, Reddit, or another popular online community in your industry, you should be actively engaging in these worlds and spreading your video content when relevant. Let\u2019s say you work for an accounting firm and are participating in a conversation where people seem to be struggling with their taxes. This is the perfect time to share your helpful video to introduce your services that some of these taxpayers may even take you up on. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve only looked at a few of your videos so don\u2019t take my word as absolute law but I think are a few things you could change. Being a tech YouTuber isn\u2019t the easiest thing in 2017 simply because there\u2019s already a lot of people doing it who can afford to review and talk about the latest hardware as soon as it comes out as well as the latest software that runs on these devices. If I wanted to see a phone review for instance I would search up MKBHD or MrMobile. To get people to watch your videos you have to have something that makes you stand out. Something that puts you on an equal playing field with them. Quality is a big factor. I absolutely love your thumbnails!! They\u2019re really bright, colourful and get to the point of what the video is about. They are definitely the same quality as YouTubers with a lot more subs than you. However, the videos themselves are not of the same quality. Below are some things I would say you could change. What to change: Perhaps try to move the camera closer to yourself when you\u2019re making a video so it looks better and people can see you properly. Trust me things like that make a big difference. The second thing you need to do is invest in some cheap studio lights. They\u2019re quite easy to get through eBay or something but they will provide much better, professional lighting for your videos. It will make them look a lot nicer. While editing you can also apply visual effects to your videos to change the way their lit however that\u2019s a topic for another time. The next thing I would look into is getting a proper microphone. I can barely hear you in some of your videos and the audio itself sounds very choppy and unprofessional. There are tricks you can do while editing to reduce these effects however if you are going to be making videos like this you need to invest in a proper microphone!! Again, you can get some cheap ones and you can just hide it up your shirt or something so it won\u2019t even be visible. Trust me this will make a big difference to your videos and make them sound so much more professional. The next thing I would suggest is that you try to speak in a more concise, slow and clear manner. I\u2019m not trying to offend you here but when you speak too fast (combined with your current microphone quality) it can be very difficult to understand what you\u2019re saying. Narration is a big thing for someone watching a YouTube video so if you spend a little time every day just trying to speak more clearly it could go a long way. Don\u2019t let having an accent discourage you! Hearing someone talk about a topic is so much more engaging than reading text on a screen or using a text to speech so keep at it. I would also like to say before I end this your intro is really good!! The whole design of your brand and logo is super professional and having a Facebook, Twitter and Instagram account is an a very effective way to gain exposure as well. Your thumbnails as I\u2019ve said are also really good. I think the only thing that\u2019s letting you down is the video and audio quality. Following all the stuff mentioned above should help with that. I hope this helped and I hope Quora gets you some exposure because by the looks of it you have a really good channel and it looks like you\u2019ve put a lot of effort into it. Good luck dude!! ",

            "answer_text": "If you are refraining from YouTube thinking that its glory days are over then consider this: YouTube has over a billion users - and that's the third of the Internet. Millions of hours are spent on YouTube, generating billions of views every day. YouTube viewership has increased by 40 percent in the last two years. The number of channels earning six figures per year on YouTube has increased by 50 percent. There is still so much life on YouTube. But if you are fresher or a newcomer on this platform then you will not get any high number of views or subscribers. So might want to take it easy on the initial stages. \"But I have been here for years and I haven't really seen the results!\" I hear you are crying. As you can see from the above statistics, it is not youtube's fault that you don't see the results. Read on for three simple strategies here to increase your YouTube views and subscribers. 1. Technical Strategies for YouTube Success Did you know that your video thumbnail is the real culprit behind the decrease in your number? Or will unchecking and testing a button be the ultimate answer to your problem? There are many small but important steps you can take to make sure your YouTube content gets the attention it deserves. Take a thumbnail image, for example. In a split second, when viewers have to decide which video to watch, your thumbnail image may be the ultimate game changer. A small but important thing to remember every time you upload a new video. Similarly, you can take several small steps to increase the number of subscribers for your channel. For example, end cards with a large subscription button subtly encourage your viewer to subscribe to your channel. Allowing embedding means more exposure, which may eventually lead to more members. There are sophisticated tips for getting your most time-consuming YouTube subscribers, but can significantly impact your subscriber numbers and engagement. Make all these changes and you'll see your subscriber count going north. 2. All these are in numbers Mattel's YouTube partner and programming strategist Isaac Quiroga runs 20 channels for the brand and likes to listen to YouTube. However, YouTube Analytics has their limitations, so he chose Tube (Nielsen for Branded Web Video) to gain more insight into the content that works on YouTube. He quickly discovered that there was a large community around American girls' stop motion videos, which were very popular on YouTube. This led him and his team to create a tutorial for making stop-motion videos using American Girl dolls, which helped boost 300% of views. They have a lot of fans in the form of stop motion video creators. If you see a decrease in views and engagement and are wondering what went wrong, take a page from Mattel's book and the numbers will guide you. As a content marketer and strategist, you need to be able to visualize how video is made and tools like Tubing. When you know what works and what doesn't, you use great and great content to bring your audience back to your channel. 3. The power of influencer videos There are many compelling reasons for influencer marketing to be good for your business. The best part about influencer videos? They are published not only on your own channel, but also on influencer channels as well, thus ensuring maximum views and a steady increase in subscribers. No matter what industry you are in, there are many bloggers and influencers out there who can help you get more subscribers. Whether you want to build a recipe or review an app, you will find many YouTubers who can help you with that. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s pretty much two things you gotta do constantly to up your sub count: Create quality content.Promote it in any way you can. (Y\u2019know, without bothering people).Consistency is one of the most important things about being a YouTuber. I know, cause it\u2019s the main reason why I constantly fail at it. Life happens, and things just get in the way, but it\u2019s your job to pull through all of that if YouTube is truly your passion and you think that you can eventually build a large following and profit off of it. You would think that the whole \u201cQuality Content\u201d idea is THE utmost important thing about YouTube, but honestly I think 90% of YouTube success comes from consistently putting out new content, as it gives you so much more reach than if you were to only upload a few times a year. That\u2019s not to say that you shouldn\u2019t spend time on making sure what you\u2019re creating is actually good. You should alway believe in what you\u2019re creating. As for promoting, what you create should be relevant somehow if you wanna gain a little bit of traction starting from nothing. That\u2019s one way to promote yourself: by putting yourself into something that\u2019s already big. You can also go to places like Reddit and drop your video in a few subs. Also utilize sites like Instagram & Twitter, as they are other places where your following can keep in touch with you, and you could even pick up new followers. Anyway, good luck to you! ",

There\u2019s a spot where you can make tags for your channel try to target your channel with all the same interest or niche for example \u2026. you like dogs and have a dog. Well on my youtube channel I just post videos of me talking to my dogs and walking around and showing people my garden. Really retarded kinda but hey people like it \u2026they like real life videos. It\u2019s like a vlog . My dog was sleeping making funny sounds I recorded that about to cutt that video and upload it. But if you want subscribers make sure you got something interesting animals get lots of views. And also be creative make something you would like to watch. Put value in your video don\u2019t make it some regular blaahhhhh that no one would want to watch \u2026entertain us \u2026.show us whats up \u2026act goofy \u2026laugh \u2026 show us whats cool about your dog and introduct yourself. Remember a good title \u2026.write a big description and good one take your time. Share links to all your other sites like twitter , instagram etc\u2026 and post your video on all the sites and on googleplus and share it on facebook to. It takes time to get a big audience unless your first video is just great and goes viral \u2026.then everyone in the whole town will be sharing it. And showing it off with others. You want to know a easy way to get subscribers put a poop stain on your butt and walk around the mall where people are laughing because it looks like you pooped your pants and have someone recording from a waze back showing everyone laughing and stuff.

            "answer_text": "Its very simple\u2026 make sure you know what your channel is about - keep it focused. Don\u2019t try to do too many different types of videos. Eg make it just about music, or just vlogs or just business - keep it specific - don\u2019t do too many different types of videos in one place.Have a manageable schedule and stick to it - eg new videos every Tuesday and Friday at 2pm EST, don\u2019t promise more videos than you can produce.make sure they are high quality and visually just as good as the top people in your area of interest - if your audio or video is low quality you wont be good enough to compete with them.make good videos - kinda obvious\u2026 and use the right tags and SEO.collaborate with bigger digital influencers / youtubers / blogs / websites - this is THE most important part. If no one else is reposting and sharing your videos then it will be very hard to get your view count up as no one is going to see them. Youtube is now so over-saturated that just uploading videos with the correct tags is not enough. You need other people to share your content who already have a following. Eg:) a twitter page with 200k followers, or making a video with someone else who is already established. Post your videos on subject specific message boards - ALWAYS BE NETWORKING and asking people to share your videos on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.Once you have momentum, keep it going - if you stop for too long you\u2019ll have to start over. Understand the \u2018snowball\u2019 effect is going to help you the most but its up to you to get it started.Repeat steps 1\u20136, pray, get a lucky rabbits foot, and understand that after all of this you need a bit of luck on your side too, and the harder the work, and the more content you put - but most importantly PROMOTE - then the more you increase your chances of getting lucky.My own channel has only just reached 1000 subscribers and I can honestly say that my subscribers didn\u2019t really start to grow until I became consistent with my uploads and made more of an effort to promote my videos, now that I\u2019m growing I need to keep it up - have a look at my channel and dont forget to subscribe to me - I am a British Vlogger so come and check out my life!http://www.youtube.com/mrandychaplin",

But here are just some short tips from someone who has a terrible channel :\u2019) Lets take someone who\u2019s channel\u2019s status skyrocketed after they posted a video for an example. Eg. bill wurtz\u2019s video \u2018'History of the entire world, I guess.\u201d If you looked at their other older videos they aren't really that impressive, since they\u2019re really short and all. So what YOU can do is for the first few videos play around a bit and do whatever and upload whatever you want, maybe comment on a lot of videos to get attention (not in the G3T FR3 IPH0N3s V131T TH1S W3BS1T3 4ND W1N). Then put a HECK lot of effort into one huge video and watch your views gradually increasing. Another thing is to try and collaborate with someone more popular. Get people to shout you out, participate in live streams and all. Get online socialising! And lastly, just really put effort into your videos. No one wants to see 10 seconds of some terrible gameplay of Pokemon go with the camera quality on 144p. You\u2019ll start off small, but eventually you will get there. Best of luck to you channel mate. ",

People usually talk about creating a youtube channel then linking it to adsense account and drop some creative content on your channel and wait for those subscribers.

You must have heard of this famous quote \u201ca friend in need is a friend indeed.\u201d Always ask your friends to share your channel with other Friends so as to get those initial Subs. But what about those random visitors, what they think about your channel ? When Someone visits your channel and he finds out that you have quality content but he realise that No Channel Art, No Logo, No Customized Youtube Page. This May lead to bad Impression. As you have just started your channel, I suggest you to put little more efforts to create a Channel Art, a Logo or your picture playing that game or a picture of the game. And also customize your channel page for visitors to get that initial impression. For creating channel Art you can use Photoshop or PicMonkey's Photo Editor | Free Online Image Editing check youtube for tutorials on how to create channel art or banner. Also for how to set those new youtube customizable layout. And also after you have uploaded a video. Try to create a thumbnail for that video, which can really help you to get more viewer's for your channel. As you have a gaming channel, If you put little effort you can get more subscribers from European Countries. Try to share your videos on facebook page, Twitter and also check for a platform or forum where you can find players playing those similar games. As they may be eager to watch this videos and they may turn out to be your new subscribers. And on your videos try to ask/mention the viewer's to subscribe to the Channel. Try all the promotional ways to get those subscribers. As of now you are new, youtube algorithms is set in such a way that it will take few months or time to get more views and subscribers. Don\u2019t give up inbetween, Just go on posting videos and one day can find yourself on the trending page. And that day will truly be memorable. ",

            "answer_text": "#1: Clean Up Your YouTube Channel Before we get into the good stuff, it is important to do some housekeeping. While you may think everything your business does is flawless, you are not Beyonc\u00e9, so your audience might not think so... I know, I know, it\u2019s hard to swallow, but it\u2019s important to step away from your self and into the shoes of an outsider from time to time. Taking a hard look at your YouTube channel and re-evaluating what is on there will likely lead to the realization that a chunk of old content should be deleted\u2014whether it is outdated, poorly produced, or just a flop of a video that should have never made it up there in the first place. If you have something of this nature tied to your brand, it\u2019s going to immediately turn that lead off, and cause them to lose trust in your brand. Delete it and never look back! This brings me to my next tip. #2: Only Create and Post Highly Watchable Content Yes, I know this tip might seem obvious, but YouTube is full of clutter, so it\u2019s easy to feel like you can get away with posting sub-par content. Well, you can\u2019t! The only way to really stand out from the pack and grow your subscriber base it to create the best of the best content in your space. The key to accomplishing this is planning during pre-production. Here are a few ways you can do this better then your competition: Do Your Research Watch your competitors\u2019 videos, as well as videos in industries outside of yours, and jot down notes of the most intriguing parts. Rather then copying what your competition is doing, find a more creative way to do it better. For example, if I was in the gum business (or any other business for that matter) I\u2019d probably take a tip or two from my all time favorite YouTube commercial, The Story of Sarah and Juan. Check it out, and just try and tell me this didn\u2019t make you cry. #3: Execute Top-Notch Channel Trailers YouTube has this beautiful feature for marketers looking to grow their subscription base, called channel trailers. These are just as they sound, short trailers that automatically play when a visitor arrives on your YouTube channel page. This is the perfect opportunity to build your subscription base, if, and only if, you create insanely compelling content. These trailers need to be short (30-60 seconds), compelling, and most importantly they need to give your visitors a reason to stay. Do they need to be hilarious, beautiful, and emotionally charged? It will definitely help! What I really can\u2019t stress enough is the need for an impactful call-to-action that gives the viewer a reason to subscribe.  #4: Make Sure Your Videos Are Under 5 Minutes So, your videos are all 30-60 minutes because your digital engineering software is complicated to explain? Or perhaps you\u2019re in the law industry and believe the only way to instill trust is to include long video testimonials on your channel? While testimonials are great, long videos and YouTube do not go well together! Regardless of how complicated the product you\u2019re marketing is, your videos should never exceed 5 minutes. #5: Turn a Set of Videos into a Binge-Worthy Playlist Do you have a set of videos that go together? Perhaps you do a recurring weekly educational series, or you have a set of webinars around the same theme? Whatever it is, you should make that grouping into a YouTube playlist. This will allow your viewers to continue watching without having to manually search for and click into the next video. #6: Add Powerful CTA\u2019s Into Your Videos All good marketers know how to create powerful calls-to-action, or CTA\u2019s. So why not use these skills of yours to give users a reason to return to your channel through a subscribe-able call-to-action? How does this work exactly? If the idea of inserting a CTA into a video sounds complicated, and possibly above your technical capabilities, I\u2019ve got good news: It\u2019s not! YouTube has made this easy by allowing marketers to add end screens and cards into their videos. Let me break down these two options a bit further. #7: Create Custom Human Thumbnails Let\u2019s face it, the reason we\u2019re warned not to judge a book by its cover is because we do it all the time. Your video thumbnail is essentially the cover of your video, so you need it to be absolutely beyond engaging. In fact, I\u2019d argue that the video thumbnail is the most critical item determining whether or not a visitor is going to play or not play your video.  ",

            "answer_text": "Below are the key steps to increase your YouTube views and ofcourse subscribers: Be a Keyword research ninja - You can\u2019t rank your videos without choosing the right keywords! Learn the art of generating the right keywords for your videos. The YouTube search bar is one of the best tools for conducting your keyword research. You can also do a competitor research manually or by using a tool like VidiqKeyword competitiveness is another way to succeed in terms of views and subscribers. Its important to find out how competitive are the keywords you have chosen. One way to check is the number of youtube search results for your keywords - and average views of these videos.Produce engaging videos your audience will be glued to - \u2018Audience Retention\u2019 is one of the most important YouTube ranking factors. Obviously a great theme and topic is critical. You would also need a a good quality camera (even a phone camera) which you can mount on a tripod. A decent background always helps - one that doesn\u2019t distract from the main focus of your video. You can even hang a neutral backdrop behind you if you can\u2019t find a good background. A microphone for better audio quality is also essential. There are hacks to increase your watch time - for example, by giving an intro before you begin - so that the crux of your content is only post 30\u201340 seconds. Another way is to highlight in the beginning that you have a bonus or a surprise in the subsequent sections or towards the end.Great titles and descriptions - Titles and descriptions are not just for Google. Having click-worthy titles and descriptions is what will give your videos a boost. Apart from helping you rank higher, adding keywords in the title, description and tags can improve your CTR. When viewers see the keywords they are searching for in your title, they are more likely to feel compelled to actually click on it. Since a high CTR can also affect your ranking on YouTube, this gives you more of a reason to make strategic use of your keywords. The descriptions don\u2019t affect your YouTube SEO directly, but they can help you show up in the \u2018Related Videos\u2019 section of YouTube, you still need to use them. Make sure that your descriptions are at least 250 words long and the keywords have been added at least 4 times. Apart from these three places, there\u2019s a fourth place where YouTube looks for your keyword: your script. Since YouTube transcribes all your videos, saying your keyword multiple times can help it understand that your content is highly relevant.Are your thumbnails saying \u2018Click Me\u2019 or \u2018Leave Me\u2019 - You only get one first impression. Make it count with the right thumbnail. I would recommend not using the auto-generated thumbnail (video still). Your video\u2019s thumbnail is the first visual audiences get of your video. Ideally, add your title in the thumbnail and make sure it\u2019s easy to read. Its important to also have a a standard style (including font, design and title placement) that you use in all your videos. This can help with branding your channel.Comments and shares - A study by Backlinko on the impact of comments and shares on YouTube videos found that there was a very high correlation between the number of comments and the rank of the video. So if you want your videos to rank higher, you need to get people to leave comments underneath them. Sometimes, viewers will leave a comment without any prompting, simply because they really liked the video. If you are a new channel and are still trying to build your presence, however, you can\u2019t rely on this alone. You need to specifically ask your viewers to comment and share if you want to see results. You can also ask a question in your video and ask viewers to add a comment with their replies. Of course, the first step for this to work is to create excellent content. If viewers don\u2019t like your videos, they aren\u2019t going to comment or share no matter how much you ask them to.Ask people to subscribe - Like getting comments, the best way to get people to subscribe to channel is also to simply ask them. At the begining and at the end of your video, ask your viewers to subscribe to your channel if they enjoyed your video. Also using the subscribe button throughout your video and at the end screens can be very useful.Find your optimal video length - With written content, such as blogs, it\u2019s simple. The longer your content, the higher your chances of ranking for it. On YouTube however, the optimal video length isn\u2019t set in stone. In general, the highest ranked videos on YouTube are long. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that short videos don\u2019t work at all. In some cases, for specific topics, shorter videos can even work better than longer ones. The ideal video duration can also vary depending upon your target audience. The key is to find the length that works best for you and for your channel. You can do this by uploading videos of varying lengths and then analysing which one gave you the best results.",

            "answer_text": "How to grow your channel? There are two strategies to grow your channel. 1.YouTube suggestions: where YouTube will start suggesting your videos on the top of other popular videos. Ex: you pick a trending video or topic and you create a similar High-Quality Video, and optimize the metadata (Title, Thumbnail, Description, and Tags)  2. Video SEO: which is ranking your videos on top of YouTube search results by optimizing your title, and metadata for a specific keyword. U can use tools like Tubebuddy, Vidiq, H-supertools, and others to grow your channel.  in order to rank a video on YouTube, you have to do the following: Find the correct keyword to rank with (High Search Volume + Low Competition)Optimize your video using the correct keyword.Example from my channel: If you open YouTube now and search for \u201camazon ses\u201d, you will find a couple of my videos on Top of YouTube Search Results. So How I did this? The first step is doing keyword research for YouTube, I do use H-supertools Free YouTube Keyword research tool to find keyword ideas. so open the tool, and enter the topic or keyword that you wanna create a video about or your published video. in my case, I searched for \u201camazon ses\u201d and here are the results:  So you can see around 22K searches per month on YouTube, and the Difficulty is Low, so I can rank somehow easily on this keyword. and on the same page of H-supertools, you will find Related Keywords, you can use as tags and mention in the video description. so I set the Video Title as: How to Use Amazon SES as your SMTP Service? | Send Bulk Emails For Cheap | AWS SES Tutorial the bold terms are keywords iam trying to rank on with this video. but the main keyword is \u201camazon ses\u201d Then in the video description: In this video, I will show you how to configure Amazon Simple Email Service ( SES) and use it as your own SMTP Server for your Email Marketing campaigns. Why Amazon SES? Maybe the main reason for selecting Amazon SES as your SMTP Service is the cheap costs. Do you believe that you can send a 100K email for 10$ !? You see the keywords in the description. Then the Tags as follows:  You can see the keywords I got from H-supertools suggested keywords. and I am ranking number one on almost all keywords. I am using vidiq here to check the keyword ranks. This is how you optimize your Video on a certain keyword to rank on YouTube top results, and by the way this may be accomplished in 1 hour and not by 1 month. I do the same operation for around 30 keywords to rank on top of YouTube, some examples: IISIIS web serverbuild SMTPSMTP serverCreate SMTPURL Rotation\u2026.. and so on. Other important points: also what helps you rank your video other than metadata (title, description and tags) is the video length and quality. if people love your content and stay more on YouTube watching your video, YouTube will rank it higher. so publish High-quality valuable videos and optimize your Thumbnail and title for higher CTR (click-through rate). So to sum up, Find the perfect keyword to rank on which has a good amount of search volume per month with low competition. then optimize your video meta tag for this keyword. Hope this helps! wish you the best ",

            "answer_text": "I will explain this answer in three steps: Content Quality: This is most important aspect of any YouTube channel. If your content is not interesting enough, people won\u2019t stick to your videos and this will cause in poor audience retention of your videos. YouTube promotes those videos organically which tends to have higher audience retention.Presentation: If your content is good enough, then step would be the presentation of your channel. You must present your content in such a way that it also feels interesting enough. Sometimes a video which have good content but is not delivered in a presentable way tends to lose viewers. For example: Thumbnails, catchy and creative titles (not clickbaits though).Paid Promotion: There are legal ways through which you can promote your videos. For example, there is a service called google ads there you can promote your video. But obviously, you need to have money for such promotions. Usually you pay roughly around Rs.0.2\u20130.3 per ad view, depending upon ad rates, they change on daily basis. I would recommend this step only when you have atleast 10\u201312 videos uploaded to your channel because a viewer from your ad will need a reason to subscribe to your channel. Make sure your content is based on single topic rather than random multiple topics. Suppose you promoted a video of cooking, then people who subscribed to you will expect you to upload more cooking videos and if you change topic of your channel afterwards it will hurt your channel. So make sure your channel is based on single topic before promoting any videos.",

            "answer_text": "Building an audience can be challenging, but with the right strategy and tactics, it\u2019s possible to establish yourself on the platform. Keep reading for six tips you can use to get more YouTube subscribers and increase youtube views 1. Create searchable titles Most people find things to watch with YouTube\u2019s search bar, and you need to keep that in mind as you name your videos. Your titles should include the keywords they\u2019d logically search when looking for the information in your video. Bringing viewers to your youtube accounts to follows the same general idea as optimizing your website. You\u2019ll need to select keywords and include them in your titles and descriptions to show up when users search for videos on your topic. So how do you know which words and phrases to include in your title? One way to begin is by typing the words you are considering using into the YouTube search bar. Check out the auto-suggested searches, which are based on what YouTube users have searched in the past. As you build your channel, or target more specific keywords, your videos may start to show up in Google search results, too. But keep in mind that only 50 characters of your title will show up in results pages \u2013 so you need to put the important keywords first. Since you only have a certain number of characters to work with, you have to make them count. Be as concise as you can, while letting users know exactly what they can expect from watching your video. 2. Write a script Have you ever watched a video that was supposed to be informational, but it was clear that they\u2019d attempted to \u201cwing it?\u201d Sometimes this approach works, but usually it\u2019s painful to watch \u2013 and sometimes even a little cringe worthy. Videos are most useful when they\u2019re organized with a script to keep you on track. The more logical flow of your video, the more helpful it will be to viewers \u2013 and the more of them will turn into subscribers. Include as much detail as possible in your script, and think about your target audience as you create it. Include all of the information you think they\u2019ll want on any given topic, and address common questions you get from your customers or clients. 3. Post consistently I enjoy watching Grey\u2019s Anatomy every Thursday at 8:00 p.m. \u2013 and one of the main reasons why is that I know I can count on an hour of Meredith Grey every week. If the show stopped following this regular schedule, and I didn\u2019t know when to expect it, I would most likely lose interest and move on. That\u2019s why consistency is key. When you post videos on a regular schedule, people will know that you\u2019re a dependable source of new information \u2013 and they\u2019ll be more likely to subscribe to your channel. People will start to expect your content, and subscribing helps them know that they\u2019re never missing out. And when you create this sense of expectation, you\u2019ll have a solid audience to create new videos for. 4. Deliver what users are looking for right from the start When people view your content, they\u2019re typically expecting something in particular. You have a very small window of time to prove to them that they made the right choice by selecting your video over the others in search results. Capturing your viewers\u2019 attention right away makes all the difference. In fact, indie band Walk off the earth found that the first eight seconds of your video are the most important \u2013 and this lesson helped them gain 127 million views in four months on YouTube. Think of it this way: If your viewer only watches the first eight seconds, which information is vital for them to have heard? That\u2019s what should come first. People don\u2019t want to waste their time, so it\u2019s your job to deliver beneficial content from the get-go. One way to consider is by shortening your introduction and getting right to the point. For example, if you\u2019re making a video tutorial that tells viewers how to accomplish a specific task, don\u2019t waste time explaining why that task matters, or who will be demonstrating. Get right to the tutorial, and help your viewers accomplish what they want as quickly as possible. Then, if they\u2019re satisfied with the information you provided, they\u2019ll be much more likely to subscribe for future videos. 5. Keep it short Are there lengthy YouTube videos out there? Yes. Are they high converting videos? Probably not. The videos with the most viewers are typically Less than five minutes. So if you can cover your topic in a shorter amount of time without losing impact, do it. Think with the \u201ctime is money\u201d mindset and give your subscribers the most value in the least amount of time. Attention spans are short, so keep your videos simple, informative, and entertaining. After all, the point of building your subscriber base is to get people to come back to your channel \u2013 so you don\u2019t need to give out every last piece of information you have in one video 6. Ask your viewers to subscribe It may sound obvious, but you should always ask your viewers to subscribe at the end of each video. Viewers want to be told what to do next. When the video they\u2019re watching is coming to an end, include a call-to-action to subscribe. Asking viewers to subscribe is similar to asking site visitors to subscribe to your email list. The most effective way to do this is to simply be straightforward and say it in the video. Tell your viewers to click subscribe to get the latest videos you post, and include a button that makes it easy for them to do so. These button overlays are easy to add in YouTube\u2019s Video Manager, and they can be simple like the ones that at the end of videos on the channel \u201cBhavna\u2019s Kitchen.\u201d You can include a simple button like this at the end of each video, and introduce it with a brief call to action like, \u201cIf you enjoyed this video, subscribe to our channel for new tutorials every Wednesday!\u201d The easier you make it for viewers to subscribe, the more likely they\u2019ll be do keep coming back and watching you videos in the future.

Customize your thumbnail, as it will help you in standing out of the crowd. Auto-generated thumbnails are often not very attention-grabbing. The best performing videos on YouTube have customized thumbnails. 3. Searchable: Tapping into the traffic can be a little tricky. Just like search engines, YouTube also uses ranking factors. So you must add strong keywords to your video. If you will use keywords in your description, title and tags, YouTube will be able to determine the relevancy of your video. Ty optimizing the description of your video with relevant and trending keywords. This will help your video to top the search results.

            "answer_text": "I assume you mean whats the best way to get more YT subscribers? If so I can suggest a few things: Firstly make sure your videos are super relevant to your target audience and that they are helping them with their problems, questions and pain points. Then make more videos and keep making them better. Make sure you are using all the space you can for meta data and tags: Make sure your target keyword appears in the title and once or twice in the description. Fill the tags area with related keywords to the one you are targeting. TubeBuddy is a great resource for this. Make sure you have a great thumbnail that stands out from the crowd. Canva is a great free resource for creating these. Lastly put strong calls to action in the video itself, the description and - if you qualify to use cards and end screens - get them in there. In other words if you want people to subscribe ask them to and show them how. If you\u2019re serious about Youtube marketing and Internet marketing in general you might want to grab this free video series put together by some of the best in the business. ",

            "answer_text": "If you have a new channel then no matter how good your videos are you're not going to get much traction from YouTube. You'll see very few organic views and probably 0 organic subscribers. Why? YouTube is doing a bad job at ranking your video high on search results or featuring your video or even notifying people by email and other alerts. Things get worse. One of the most important metrics on YouTube is watching time. Probably in the first 72 hours. So if you don't get enough views,your video is going to be buried down even further on search results. What do you do? Connect with all your friends family and professional contacts and get your first 100 subscribers. Try to get them to view each video and pull in atleast 300 views on every new video. Social sharing Don't go overboard by sharing your video only on a single social media site. Drip feed these links to your video. Not more than 2 to 5 links to your video from each network per day. YouTube sometimes considers incoming links from the same network as spam and bad quality and sometimes even penalises the chanel and deletes your views. It Stops counting views for a couple of hours altogether. If you're serious about your videos buy a couple of ads from Google AdWords to get your initial views. After you cross 100 subscribers you will notice organic growth. Now is the time to better your video quality and storytelling to make your videos more engaging for your viewers. Learn from your analytics and metrics and tweak your future videos to make them more interesting wherever you notice drop offs. You may also consider improving audio quality in case it's not good enough already. I have been planning to write on these topics in detail to cover an entire workflow for YouTube especially for new channels you can check out my website blog http://wif.co.in/blog/ ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s no denying it; video marketing has been on the rise over the past few years, growing ever more popular and accessible for brands. And while popular sites such as SnapChat, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and even your own website are great places to invest, YouTube remains the giant in the space, with individuals spending a billion hours each day watching videos on this platform. Often referred to as the world\u2019s \u201csecond largest search engine,\u201d YouTube can help your content be found quickly and engaged with thoroughly - if you know a few tricks. Here are ten ways you can grow your YouTube channel in 2018.  1. Build Videos Around a Single Keyword/Topic It may seem obvious, but building your video around a single topic/keyword is the best way to get the traffic you want and grow your audience. Many people who are unaware of SEO best practices skip this step, but it\u2019s crucial if you want your videos to get the maximum amount of viewers. Try using a keyword tool like KeywordTool.io, which is specific to YouTube, to look for the most searched keywords in the niche you\u2019re looking to target. It\u2019s important to pick your keyword before you even build your video content because it helps you construct the best information around that specific topic. It also helps you remember to include your keyword naturally throughout the content so YouTube picks it up when closed captions are added. Once you\u2019ve chosen your keyword, check out the videos that are currently ranking for that topic to make sure you\u2019re on the right track in terms of intent, and don\u2019t forget to optimize your title and descriptions. Despite popular myths, the most successful videos on YouTube are typically less than 5 minutes long, so don\u2019t feel you have to make a film or write a novel. Keep it short and sweet. 2. Reformat Existing Quality Content Of course, the easiest way to grow your channel is to build great content. But that content doesn\u2019t always have to be built from scratch. Some of your best videos can be built from engaging, valuable, useful and actionable content you\u2019ve already created. Many people go to YouTube to find answers and how-to tutorials for the issues they\u2019re facing, so content that solves problems is a great fit. Look at the blogs, guides, and other high-performing pieces you currently have and think about how to make them into cool videos.  3. Engage with Your Audience It's important not to overlook the fact that YouTube is a social media channel, and therefore demands social interaction. If you\u2019re just posting videos without encouraging comments and discussion, you\u2019re missing a trick. YouTube rewards channels with great engagement, including overall time spent on channel, watch time, likes and dislikes, and most importantly, comments. Try to respond to every comment you receive (if possible!) and ask users to engage with audio/visual prompts. 4. Get Branded So your content is great. But is your channel itself visually appealing? If you want visitors to take your YouTube channel seriously and subscribe to your channel, you need to look professional. Branding your channel will also help users immediately recognize your content. If you have a blog or website, you probably already have some sort of look and feel you use to differentiate yourself from other individuals and/or companies, so it only makes sense to carry over that branding to your YouTube channel as well. Here\u2019s an example from fashion brand ModCloth.  In addition to visual branding, don\u2019t forget to add custom URLs to your channel header - and to write an interesting bio about who you are and what your videos are about. 5. Promote Your YouTube Videos on Other Social Channels One of the beautiful things about social media is that you can cross-promote content on different channels. Promoting your YouTube videos on your other social channels is the easiest way to grow your audience. What channels are you on? Facebook, Linkedin, Instagram, Pinterest? There are many from which to choose. And if there\u2019s a channel (such as Facebook) on which you want to post videos directly, you can always do a teaser for the full-length video on YouTube so that you have optimum engagement on all channels. Don\u2019t forget about your blog; you can post your videos there as well! 6. Show Up If you\u2019re running YouTube by yourself or as part of a small organization, it can be extremely beneficial to put your own face on screen. When you put a face to a brand, your audience can more easily connect with you as an individual. This is especially important for bloggers; fitness, life, or business coaches; and solopreneurs. Every video you make doesn\u2019t need to include your face, but you should reach out personally to your audience every few videos or so. Additionally, if you are this type of YouTuber, use a photo of yourself on your channel (not your logo). See the example still from marketing guru Adam Erhart below.  7. Post Great Thumbnails They may seem like a small thing (because they are), but thumbnails can have a big impact. YouTube advertises other videos via thumbnail in its sidebar, so you want yours to stand out among the pack. The same goes for YouTube search. Videos with a catchy title and appealing thumbnail usually rank higher, even if the content itself isn\u2019t as valuable, because they have a higher click-through-rate (CTR). To get your CTR where it needs to be, try using tactics such as highlighted areas, arrows, large text, and unexpected or unusual images. See the example below from Neil Patel.  8. Leverage YouTube Cards We\u2019ve already discussed the fact that YouTube rewards channels that keep viewers on their pages longer. These longer average watch times mean people are truly engaged with your content. (You can see how long people are staying on your videos by using YouTube analytics). By adding YouTube cards, you can add additional recommended videos at the exact point where users are currently dropping off. Though they may abandon that video, users will be taken to your other content and stay on your channel, increasing your channel\u2019s ranking. 9. Push for Subscriptions One of the ways you know for sure that viewers are engaged with your channel is when they \u201csubscribe\u2019 to see any new videos that are posted. Ask viewers to subscribe to your channel in each video that you upload, and keep engaged with your existing subscribed users. (You can see your list of subscribers, here). Never pay for subscribers. This will only bring down your engagement and hurt the authenticity of your account in the long run. Remember, if you don\u2019t ask your viewers to subscribe, you may be missing out on a lot of potential followers. 10. Increase Your Uploading Frequency This tip may sound intimidating at first, but to grow your audience, you need to increase your posting frequency to at least one video a week. Don\u2019t worry; you don\u2019t need a design firm or fancy advertising budget to get this done. Today\u2019s smartphones offer excellent video recording ability, and tools such as Animotomake editing videos easy for anyone. Consistency is of the utmost importance. Try to post at the same time each day or week (depending on your frequency), and keep your subscribers updated about when new videos will arrive. Then stick to your schedule. Remember, driving engagement with quality content is what develops engaged followers and subsequently. advocators of your brand! Be true to yourself and your brand, and communicate with your audience along the way. ",

            "answer_text": "#1: Clean Up Your YouTube Channel Before we get into the good stuff, it is important to do some housekeeping. While you may think everything your business does is flawless, you are not Beyonc\u00e9, so your audience might not think so... I know, I know, it\u2019s hard to swallow, but it\u2019s important to step away from your self and into the shoes of an outsider from time to time. Taking a hard look at your YouTube channel and revaluating what is on there will likely lead to the realization that a chunk of old content should be deleted \u2013 whether it is outdated, poorly produced, or just a flop of a video that should have never made it up there in the first place. If you have something of this nature tied to your brand, it\u2019s going to immediately turn that lead off, and cause them to lose trust in your brand. Delete it and never look back! #2: Only Create and Post Highly Watchable Content Yes, I know this tip might seem obvious, but YouTube is full of clutter, so it\u2019s easy to feel like you can get away with posting sub-par content. Well, you can\u2019t! The only way to really stand out from the pack and grow your subscriber base it to create the best of the best content in your space. The key to accomplishing this is planning during pre-production. #3: Execute Top-Notch Channel Trailers YouTube has this beautiful feature for marketers looking to grow their subscription base, called channel trailers. These are just as they sound, short trailers that automatically play when a visitor arrives on your YouTube channel page. This is the perfect opportunity to build your subscription base, if, and only if, you create insanely compelling content. These trailers need to be short (30-60 seconds), compelling, and most importantly they need to give your visitors a reason to stay. Do they need to be hilarious, beautiful, and emotionally charged? It will definitely help! What I really can\u2019t stress enough is the need for an impactful call-to-action that gives the viewer a reason to subscribe. #4: Make Sure Your Videos Are Under 5 Minutes So, your videos are all 30-60 minutes because your digital engineering software is complicated to explain? Or perhaps you\u2019re in the law industry and believe the only way to instill trust is to include long video testimonials on your channel? While testimonials are great, long videos and YouTube do not go well together! Regardless of how complicated the product you\u2019re marketing is, your videos should never exceed 5 minutes. Why? Well, science. Study after study proves that online video viewers have a short attention span. I mean, did you forget earlier when I told you how 20 percent of viewers drop off within the first 10 seconds? In fact, HubSpot has found that the ideal length for videos on YouTube is a nice and concise 2 minutes. So re-edit those long webinars, and turn them into short, snappy clips. #5: Turn a Set of Videos into a Binge-Worthy Playlist Do you have a set of videos that go together? Perhaps you do a recurring weekly educational series, or you have a set of webinars around the same theme? Whatever it is, you should make that grouping into a YouTube playlist. This will allow your viewers to continue watching without having to manually search for and click into the next video. Why is this good for subscription growth? Well, it will keep people on your channel longer, and show them that you have a plethora of quality content. This will also keep your video content highly organized so your channel doesn\u2019t become a cluttered mess that turns users away. #6: Add Powerful CTA\u2019s Into Your Videos All good marketers know how to create powerful calls-to-action, or CTA\u2019s. So why not use these skills of yours to give users a reason to return to your channel through a subscribe-able call-to-action? How does this work exactly? If the idea of inserting a CTA into a video sounds complicated, and possibly above your technical capabilities, I\u2019ve got good news: It\u2019s not! YouTube has made this easy by allowing marketers to add end screens and cards into their videos. #7: Create Custom Human Thumbnails Let\u2019s face it, the reason we\u2019re warned not to judge a book by its cover is because we do it all the time. Your video thumbnail is essentially the cover of your video, so you need it to be absolutely beyond engaging. In fact, I\u2019d argue that the video thumbnail is the most critical item determining whether or not a visitor is going to play or not play your video. The greatest way to ensure people play your video is by using an image of a smiling human making direct eye-contact as the thumbnail for your video. Why? People relate to other people. Another hot tip to take your thumbnail to the next level \u2013 throw a smile on it! #8: Post Often and Consistently Yes, I understand this might be hard to fathom at first. Not every marketing team has a full-time videographer to be grinding out content after all. Luckily, if you followed my advice in Tip #2 about building an in-house studio, scripting and creating well-done videos can easily become part of your weekly workflow. Consistency is key, because subscribers are not going to stay subscribed if you never update your channel or if you update 4 times in one week and then take a month-long hiatus. #9: Invest in YouTube Advertising The time has come to take your wallet out. You didn\u2019t think all of these tips would be free of charge, did you? Take a deep breath, I\u2019m not asking you to shell out too much cash, but putting some budget behind promoting your YouTube channel is a pretty full-proof way of increasing your subscription base. The internet is a crowded space, and money talks, so it\u2019s important to invest some of your marketing budget behind your channel. YouTube makes advertising your channel very customizable with a variety of ad formats, including: Display adsOverlay adsSkippable and non-skippable video adsBumper adsSponsored cardsSimilar to platforms like Facebook and Twitter, YouTube also allows for video targeting based on interest, demographics, and/or in-market audiences. #10: Promote your Channel to Relevant Online Communities Whether it be a Twitter chat, LinkedIn group, Reddit, or another popular online community in your industry, you should be actively engaging in these worlds and spreading your video content when relevant. Let\u2019s say you work for an accounting firm and are participating in a conversation where people seem to be struggling with their taxes. This is the perfect time to share your helpful video to introduce your services that some of these tax payers may even take you up on. ",

You need to use all of the tools available to you such as cards to get people to watch your videos. You need to create playlists to spread the word of your video. You need to ask your viewers to subscribe to your videos. You need to optimize your video for search and key words. You need to share your video on all social sites like twitter, Facebook, Blogger, Tumblr and more. You need to spread your videos around so they get noticed.

Had you asked this same question 5 or so years ago, you'd have had a much better shot at getting popular, due to the lower amount of channels in all of the genres. Now, there's tons of channels in each genre such as gaming. However, not ALL of these channels are successful because they lack the extra factor. They lack uniqueness or creativity. And that's what you need to do. Make unique content that is creative and stands out from the other videos in the genre you wish to specialise in. Let's say you want to make tutorial videos. You could do what a plethora of others do and just do a basic step-by-step tutorial. Or, you could make a step-by-step tutorial with good visuals. Make something cool. Make jokes or say something funny, or whatever you want. Essentially, just be different to all other YouTubers out there. It's hard but not impossible. ",

And this is where a knowledge of YouTube SEO can come to be handy for you. You need to optimize your videos and channel for them to rank higher for relevant keywords. When you're ranking high, your videos will generally get more number of views. And when that happens, you're likely to gain more subscribers through an effective conversion rate optimization.  (Courtesy: Boostlikes.com) So, the talk comes to how do you optimize your videos and channels to rank higher on the search result pages? The solution isn't that simple. Not at least today, when there are so many amazing creators in virtually every niche. But that being said, it doesn't mean you can't do it. Few basic measures, if pulled religiously, can help you achieve what you're looking for. Here are some tips: i) Be very consistent- This is extremely important. No one will subscribe your channel if the videos are uploaded irregularly. So, whether you have planned to make daily uploads or weekly, consistency is the key. Even if the viewer does not subscribe you the first time, if your channel gets a repeated exposure in front of them with fresh videos, they will eventually hit that subscribe button. Read more.. ",

The main reason someone hits the subscribe button is because they admire the works of the publisher and love to hear more often from them. YouTube subscribers usually do not like channels that are not regular. Consistency is the key here to develop a long-lasting relationship with your existing subscribers and developing new ones. Release your videos in a timely, recurring and structured fashion. Try to publish a video in a week or at least once or twice in a month. Stick to your schedule and do not upload videos as and when you feel like doing it, it will hurt your reputation. Whatever you do, make sure that your schedule is prominent and upload videos accordingly. ",

It is by far the most demanding and difficult platform to be successful on when you compare it to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, etc. The only \u201ceasy\u201d way of doing this is to fool yourself and buy fake subscribers. This will however accomplish nothing and is a waste of time. I highly recommend not to buy views/subs/comments on any social media platform, especially YouTube. Here are some tips to help you grow your channel: Have a good profile pic and channel artUpload on a consistent schedule.Upload once a week, on the same day, and preferably the same time of day. Or upload 3 times a week. Or upload once per day. Don\u2019t upload twice one week, then upload the next video 2 months later.Have a descriptive title people might search for.Have your description and tags ready before you upload.Fill in your recording date and location when uploading a video.Create a catchy, enticing custom thumbnail that stands out for each video.Make sure you utilize watermarks (branding), cards and end screens in every video you upload to promote your other videos.Ask people to like, comment and subscribe and tell them why they should do each one.Create content that people want to share.Make sure you videos bring value to viewers, wether it be: entertainment, comedy, tutorials, education, news\u2026 something that people love and value.Promote your videos on social media and to friends.Embed your videos on a website or blog.Send email blasts to promote your videos.Work hard and improve everyday!

If you are looking for fastest yet safe way, can check out this reputable site and engage with them. What they will do is run a campaign to help promote your channel and get people interested to be as your subscribers. Other than that, you may as well download their app and do exchange subscribers for free. Isn\u2019t it awesome?  Besides that, here are tricks and tips you can apply to increase YouTube subscribers: Insert call-to-action in your videos You had watch most YouTube videos and most of them will ask you to subscribe, like, comment, or share at the end of the video is it? Why not you try to implement the same way in your case. Viewers will probably follow what you ask them to do rather than you kept silent on it. You can insert call-to-action at the beginning/end or both of your video. YouTube also makes it easy for you to place a subscribe button on your end screen. The card must appear at least 25 seconds in the last 5 to 20 seconds of your clip. Turn searches to subscribers with playlists You actually can turn normal audiences or searches into subscribers by using YouTube playlists. These boost content consumption, retain subscribers, and boost your watch time. You can follow the suggestion to create YouTube playlists based on three viewer cohorts that is first-time viewers, task-oriented viewers and topic-focused viewers. For those who still confuse, here are the steps to create a playlist in YouTube: Start with a video you want in the playlistUnder the video, click add toClick create new playlistEnter a playlist nameUse the drop down box to select your playlist\u2019s privacy setting. If it\u2019s private, people can\u2019t find it when they search YouTubeClick createPromote your channel everywhere in social networks You can find relevant Facebook group by searching your keyword and then start to make people aware about your channel there. But please avoid spamming. Next, Reddit. Reddit users organize themselves into subreddits which are communities based around a topic. Find 10 to 20 subreddits and tell people about your YouTube channel and making sure that your content is relevant to them. Collaborate with other YouTubers This is done by every major YouTuber, and so should you. You get introduced to their audience by collaborating with other developers. Search and reach out to other channels in your room. Make sure that you choose outlets that follow a similar scale. Do not reach out to someone with 500,000 if you have 500 subscribers. Be consistent in posting good videos Sound obvious right? But not many people can deliver a good content. Think of original content that can give values and benefit to others. Post quality rather than quantity and be consistent i posting videos. No one would subscribe to a channel that post once per month right? Give values via videos and all the best! ",

You have probably watched a YouTube video where the creator has reminded people to subscribe to their channel. There is a reason. The most important reason people want subscribers is that they encourage more views.

More views mean more money because many YouTubers will sell product placement in their video or are building a brand on YouTube. It also means that the video is much more likely to get promoted across YouTube.

            "answer_text": "The method I use for increasing my Subs count is quite simple. But if you look at from a simple view point, you would fail to grasp exactly how it work. I first buy a good number of subs from a site called \u201cInstantviews.co\u201d This way, I first get the ATTENTION of YouTube that my channel is growing and having subscribers. And once this attention is gained and SEO signal is sent to YouTube Algo, my channel\u2019s videos start having a boost in their ranking. They more frequently show up on top of YouTube search results, especially for long-tail keywords. And thus I get more organic views, likes, and more importantly, Subscribers. I play this game quite often, one in every week to show that the popularity of channel is constantly growing. And this way I successfully collected 23k subs for one of my Wedding channels. So it\u2019s not just buying Subs I am doing. I am rather using the purchased Subs to seduce the YouTube Algo and collect more organic Subs. Sure it costs money, but it saves a lot of my time and helps my channel grow at a 10x times faster speed. But I must warn you that to play this game, you need to buy REAL subs. Fake subs usually drop out in 24 hours, long before you can use them to send an SEO signal. So you need real subs that will stick. And I prefer InstantViews .co exactly for this reason. Their subs are not engaging, to be honest, but they are real and never drop. And besides, their price is quite affordable as well. So if you want to use this strategy for increasing your Channel\u2019s subs and SEO value, you can contact this provider. Hopefully they can help you execute this strategy with their proven subs that are sticky and original. Hope this helps Cheers\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s start off with some existing pros: Your format, music and overall video editing is nice! As a fellow person who loves cooking and eating, it\u2019s a channel that I would look through and learn. However\u2026 you have certain limitations that might stop you from going over a certain threshold of subscribers. As much as you might not like it, you need to have a call to action in your video. It can be simple and a few seconds, but reminding your viewers to like and subscribe will really go a long way. Be creative with it if you dont like the bland call to action most youtubers use.You might want to try using english? I understand that you are very enthusiastic on your culture (and you have every right to be, i mean\u2026 the food looks amazing!) but you are catering to a broad audience. If you focus on using your national language, you\u2019ll only be reaching out to your own local community which will then put a certain subscriber limit since only your community will really enjoy the full content that you are providing. Try using english in your videos, or if you can\u2019t really speak it that well, just using music at the background with english subtitle explaining the parts of the video.I do hope to see more of your videos and I hope I\u2019ve been helpful, even just a little in your channel\u2019s growth. All the best! ",

So for example creat a social media page Ex. Instagram / Facebook / Twitter where you constantly update your followers, on whats going on with your channel, and when you upload a video. Secondly, its important to interact with your subscribers. If someone in the comment asks a question, don't be selfish, answer it. Of course once you gain a decent audience this can be harder, but try your best. Lastly, you did not add a link to your channel, but people like it when you keep up with the \u201ctrends\u201d. You may not like it, and thats completely fine, i personally don't anyways. But if you keep up with trends people can interact with you more, therefore gaining a bigger audience. Some ways you can do this is by playing popular games, doing crazy challenges, or simply focus on a topic you really enjoy and just have fun. Good luck :) Dave 19 Views ",

The most I can give to you is consistent and quality posts. A great example of this is f r e s h, a YouTube channel. He has only been uploading since Mid-November 2018. He had 100 subs in early December. He currently has 56 thousand subscribers. How? He posts consistent (daily, in fact) 9\u201310 minute Reddit videos showcasing different subreddits. The main thing people like about his videos (including me) is his nice voice and interesting and funny videos of him showcasing Reddit posts. I do not have many subscribers at this time (and I do not intend to) because I do not post very consistent or interesting content. That is the main tip I can give, however. Consistent and funny content. Heck, it doesn\u2019t even have to be original. Just do something similar to what f r e s h did and you\u2019ll be well on your way. ",

When making YouTube videos, you should put yourself in the shoes of viewers and think \"what would make me want to stick around and watch this entire video?\" Follow this advice, and I bet you can create a video which will attract and retain viewers. Nail the first 15 seconds. Make sure the first 15 seconds of your video is engaging and interesting. If you can hook your audience within the first 15 seconds, you will have a good watch time. Promote, promote, promote. Figure out where your audience is hanging out and start targeting those sites. Go to blogs that relate to your content and share your video or reply in the comment sections of the related video. Engagement. Engage with your followers by liking their comments and replying them back. You can also like and comment on their photos that you like. Use catchy thumbnails. Thumbnails are one of the deciding factors for your video. Check out what kind of thumbnails, channels in your niche have. Then create a unique thumbnail for your own video, which is related to your content. Cross-collaborations. You can collaborate with brands and influencers. You can offer promotions in exchange for free products or services. Brands use influencer marketing platforms such as Phlanx, to connect with influencers.  ",

Also, something I didn't mentioned in that post is that you shouldn't forget to encourage viewers to like, comment, share and subscribe your video. Do this beginning your videos and or at the end. One more thing, include a subscribe link inside the description of each video (You can track the links with http://goo.gl) and put a little blurb that says \u201csubscribe here\". Now at the end of that link add the following snippet of code, that way when someone click on the link it will automatically prompt them to subscribe: \u201c?sub_confirmation=1\u201d (Without the quotes) This works really well ;) For more tips: FreeBootcamp Regards, Alex ",

It was couple years back when I realized that I\u2019m a talented guy :P I started a new channel (my old channel had some issues with monetization). I uploaded around 100 videos in just a month and I had zero subscribers. I still remember I used to research a lot about how to promote my videos, how to make my videos stand out, how to make people discover my videos. Still nothing. After 5 months, I had 10 subscribers on youtube, around 50 followers on twitter and around 140 on instagram. After a month, I decided to NOT to follow all those \u2018marketing\u2019 advice random people on internet give and kept on making videos about things that I love.

It can take you a lot of time, but if you'll use them there is a big chance that you'll achieve your goal. First, collaborate with other YouTubers, it can extremely expose your channel to the other YouTuber subscribers. Second, use your other social media profiles and promote your YouTube channel there too. Third, be consistent. Upload a video once a week. People love to see continuity. Also, make sure your video is a high-quilty one. Make sure you have a good light and your video have a clear sound, no one want to see a non-quilty video. Gaining subscribers on your own can take you a lot of time, so consider to buy YouTube subs. I can say that I used GetFans service and that it was extremely helpful for me. It made my channel to look more legit and helped me to gain more organic subscribers to my YouTube channel. So the more subscribers to your channel, the more your channel will look legit/popular.

And she currently has 206 subscribers and she is up 40 videos. I would like to tell her that she shouldn't be posting every single day. People should actually be eager for her videos and she shouldn't post everyday. I would recommend her to post every single week for her good. Let her give people time to watch her videos and subscribe or else she will be like 500 videos and just a 100 k subscribers. Long story short, if you want more subscribers just post every single week or twice a week but don't post every single day and have loads of exciting content and be real coz my friend tries British accent which does not suit her at all.

Facebook When people think of promoting their video on Facebook, they will often think of using a Facebook page. This might have worked five years ago. However, Facebook has mostly eliminated the organic reach of Facebook pages, which makes sharing posts primarily useless unless you pay to boost your posts.

            "answer_text": "Keep in mind, YouTube isn't serious like Google and their calculation is extraordinary. In the event that you need the most traffic, you simply need to follow some basic steps. It might seem like a great deal, yet it isn't. A large portion of them are short and simple to understand. While it is not crucial that you follow these steps, it is highly recommended as they yield the best results. Push hard in the initial 24 hours Unlike customary SEO, content that performs well in the initial 24 hours will in general do well for the life of the video. On the off chance that you have an email list or a message pop-up list, inform them of your YouTube video right when it gets uploaded. If YouTube notices that your video is doing admirably right off the bat, they will suggest it to more individuals and rank it higher. Transfer text-based transcripts Although YouTube can, to some degree, unravel what your video is about, it is recommended that you don't depend on it. It is better that you physically transfer an interpretation of every video. While this might be an extra bit of effort you\u2019re putting in, it will enable YouTube to figure out what your video is about and rank you for the correct terms. Chill with your audience YouTube is a social site. Content that gets the most commitment plays out the best. The undeniable suggestion is to advise viewers to leave a like and comment on your video, and to subscribe to your channel. Be that as it may, what works the best is reacting to your audience\u2019s comments. Many YouTubers starting out (and well into their careers) try to address their followers\u2019 comments during a video, or react to them in the comments section. Concentrate on active visitor clicking percentage Similar to Google search, YouTube takes a long look at the active clicking factor. From utilizing video thumbnails that shine, to making convincing features, you need to get viewers to tap on your video rather than anybody else's. If you need a cool looking thumbnail, use SocialBook\u2019s clipping tool to make a customized image. Utilize the correct keywords Similar to Google, if you focus on inappropriate hashtags, you won't get a lot of adoration. You can utilize SocialBook YouTube Builder or if you need a free suggestion you can utilize Ubersuggest. While scanning for the correct hashtags, don't simply pursue the ones that have the most elevated traffic, center around the ones that are additionally identified with your video. Keep your subscribers on YouTube YouTube doesn't need individuals to leave the platform. Sending individuals off to your site at the beginning of your channel will hurt you. Also, if your video isn't relatable enough, you won't progress sufficiently. Since you got the nuts and bolts down, how about we go over if YouTube is extremely justified, despite all the trouble. ",

            "answer_text": "With its widespread popularity, it\u2019s hard for marketers to ignore the video marketing channel. But with such high popularity comes high competition. The channel is crowded with an endless library of video content, so how can you stand out?  We\u2019ve all caught ourselves binge watching hours upon hours of cat videos. There is nothing to be ashamed of! The question is, how can marketers steal attention away from these famous cats to get more eyes on their own YouTube channels? This is just what this article aims to provide for you \u2013 because if you\u2019ve spent the time to invest in video then not only do you want a return, you need a return! It\u2019s time to grow your channel\u2019s subscribers through some strategic work. Here are 12 tips to grow your YouTube subscribers, fast! #1: Clean Up Your YouTube Channel Before we get into the good stuff, it is important to do some housekeeping. While you may think everything your business does is flawless, you are not Beyonc\u00e9, so your audience might not think so... I know, I know, it\u2019s hard to swallow, but it\u2019s important to step away from your self and into the shoes of an outsider from time to time.  Taking a hard look at your YouTube channel and revaluating what is on there will likely lead to the realization that a chunk of old content should be deleted \u2013 whether it is outdated, poorly produced, or just a flop of a video that should have never made it up there in the first place. If you have something of this nature tied to your brand, it\u2019s going to immediately turn that lead off, and cause them to lose trust in your brand. Delete it and never look back! This brings me to my next tip\u2026 #2: Only Create and Post Highly Watchable Content Yes, I know this tip might seem obvious, but YouTube is full of clutter, so it\u2019s easy to feel like you can get away with posting sub-par content. Well, you can\u2019t! The only way to really stand out from the pack and grow your subscriber base it to create the best of the best content in your space. The key to accomplishing this is planning during pre-production. Here are a few ways you can do this better then your competition: Do Your Research Watch your competitors\u2019 videos, as well as videos in industries outside of yours, and jot down notes of the most intriguing parts. Rather then copying what your competition is doing, find a more creative way to do it better. For example, if I was in the gum business (or any other business for that matter) I\u2019d probably take a tip or two from my all time favorite YouTube commercial, The Story of Sarah and Juan. Check it out, and just try and tell me this didn\u2019t make you cry. It is pretty obvious what is so wonderful about this commercial: the ability it has to elicit powerful emotions. How could your company do this? Script ahead You might think you can wing it on screen. Well, you can \u2013 but you shouldn\u2019t. You need to plan out your script, do a table read, re-write it, table read, and re-write it again. This process improves your script to make it take on the story you\u2019re trying to convey in the most powerful way. Businesses often underutilize the power of scripting, but mastering this art can take your videos to an entirely new level. If you\u2019re new to video scripting, check out this guide from Wistia! Purchase the right equipment for an in-house studio What is the \u201cright\u201d equipment? And can you afford it? This answer to the latter question is yes! Shockingly enough, the camera isn\u2019t your most important piece of equipment. Why? Well, nowadays the camera on your iPhone is close in quality to a much more expensive alternative. If you are shooting in-house, the most important equipment to have is a simple background, studio lights, and a tripod. Yes, there are a few other things you might need depending on the video, like props and audio equipment, but nailing down some of the basics and creating a solid in-office studio will lead to better video creation.  Wistia comes to our aid again with this awesome DIY Studio Set-up Guide. Also check out our own guide to creating a video culture at your company. Make the first 10 seconds of your video the most memorable Did you know that a whopping 20 percent of viewers drop off within the first 10 seconds of your video? This is why you need to make the most of the most first few seconds. To make an awesome first impression, don\u2019t start your video with a bland introduction, but rather with the most climactic part of your video. If you start with a bang viewers aren\u2019t going to want to leave. #3: Execute Top-Notch Channel Trailers YouTube has this beautiful feature for marketers looking to grow their subscription base, called channel trailers. These are just as they sound, short trailers that automatically play when a visitor arrives on your YouTube channel page. This is the perfect opportunity to build your subscription base, if, and only if, you create insanely compelling content. These trailers need to be short (30-60 seconds), compelling, and most importantly they need to give your visitors a reason to stay. Do they need to be hilarious, beautiful, and emotionally charged? It will definitely help! What I really can\u2019t stress enough is the need for an impactful call-to-action that gives the viewer a reason to subscribe. Check out this awesome example from SoulPancake. Not only is the trailer the perfect length, it provokes motivational emotions, comedy, and ends with a very creative call-to-action.  #4: Make Sure Your Videos Are Under 5 Minutes So, your videos are all 30-60 minutes because your digital engineering software is complicated to explain? Or perhaps you\u2019re in the law industry and believe the only way to instill trust is to include long video testimonials on your channel? While testimonials are great, long videos and YouTube do not go well together! Regardless of how complicated the product you\u2019re marketing is, your videos should never exceed 5 minutes. Why? Well, science. Study after study proves that online video viewers have a short attention span. I mean, did you forget earlier when I told you how 20 percent of viewers drop off within the first 10 seconds? In fact, HubSpot has found that the ideal length for videos on YouTube is a nice and concise 2 minutes. So re-edit those long webinars, and turn them into short, snappy clips.  If you feel like you can\u2019t cut down your content, the tip below will definitely come in handy! #5: Turn a Set of Videos into a Binge-Worthy Playlist Do you have a set of videos that go together? Perhaps you do a recurring weekly educational series, or you have a set of webinars around the same theme? Whatever it is, you should make that grouping into a YouTube playlist. This will allow your viewers to continue watching without having to manually search for and click into the next video. Why is this good for subscription growth? Well, it will keep people on your channel longer, and show them that you have a plethora of quality content. This will also keep your video content highly organized so your channel doesn\u2019t become a cluttered mess that turns users away. BuzzFeed Tasty does an awesome job at this. Check out their YouTube playlist page, which is grouped by different categories like, \u201cDinner,\u201d \u201cVegetarian,\u201d and my personal favorite because I despise dishes, \u201cOne-Pot Recipes.\u201d ",

I would say find a topic that has little stuff on it but has a high demand. I started a little magazine on Flipboard for Cinematography a few years back and it quickly became the top magazine for the subject with over 12,000 regular viewers. It was at a time when a lot of people were making movies but there was not much in area of resources about it. That is how you will have success. ",

If you have a singular top performing video, I would suggest you consider putting $20 or $50 into boosting that video to have a paid extension of audience. Like an ad. ( if reaching more people is that important to you.). Once you start hitting larger audience, I think you\u2019ll begin to gather a larger and larger following. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s pretty secretive the algorithms that YouTube uses to determine who sees what videos, but as each of your videos gets a larger viewership, and as you continue to consistently create more content, interesting content. Then I think the algorithm will reward your videos with appearing a little more often in peoples feed. Then it will grow organically, and maybe even one of them will get lucky and go viral. ",

This is blatantly obvious but people don't seem to take this seriously. People come to your channel, that means they see your other content, not just the video they clicked on to get there. If there is good content they will subscribe. So instead of looking for one viral video or spamming people, make a bunch of good content; innovative, creative and with good production value so when people come, they'll stay. Getting people to your channel is easy. Getting them to stay is not. That's why a bank of good videos is very useful in getting subscribers, real subscribers who will watch your every video and hopefully like and share and comment. ",

So I started learning about it and here are few of my conclusions about it. I hope they will help you. Don\u2019t look for instant success or viral success because it doesn\u2019t last.Upload videos as frequently as you can and upload 100 videos on your channel before you start to make a strategy.Don\u2019t make too polished videos as people are unable to connect with you.Keep posting regularly.Promote yourself on Social Media but don\u2019t over-promote as that might turn people against you.First three seconds are most important. Establish everything in that time. Don\u2019t use long introduction or graphics. People are here for content and they don\u2019t have patience.In your videos, tell people to subscribe to your channel. It works. Even if people like a video they won\u2019t subscribe, like or comment because it is an extra effort on their part and it doesn\u2019t bring any return for them and it is not natural for them.Use great thumbnails and don\u2019t be lazy about it. Use photoshop to create great thumbnails.Follow your passion and don\u2019t just make videos seeing what works in the market. Two things sell on youtube - Either personality or content.",

            "answer_text": "There is not a magic answer to this. I recommend picking your niche. Whatever that primary topic is, you have to consistently create content. Post regularly (at least weekly). Be yourself, part of the allure of YouTube is the connection and community that builds around each channel. Then after you are posting regularly, promote it through social media. I would recommend doing it in a way that isn't obnoxious. Share links when a topic in your video is relevant. For example if I had a video on top tips for creating great content, I might share it on a post like this. Lastly there are a few things that will have people bail out on your videos that you want to avoid. Leverage the whole screen, if you are starting out shooting video on your phone be sure to do it in landscape mode. Be sure your sound is good. You don't have to use a professional microphone (it helps) but when you edit, adjust sound levels in your clips so all sound is a consistent volume. Once you have done all this promote it in forums, Facebook, twitter and others. It is most often NOT a get righ scheme despite the fact that we all here stories of some doing it. It is rare and unusual. After a couple years of doing all of this we have 1200 subscribers so it is still relatively small. ",

That's one thing YouTube checks when filtering the videos for viewer. Another thing you can try to do is put as many links in description as you can but make sure that the links are relevant and the sites to which link you provide are safe for all users. Another thing which you definitely know is that you have to put good relevant tags for your while uploading so that viewers get yout video in their search list if they want to see your kind of content. And the last but not the least you can do one thing that almost evert YouTuber does, make the title and thumbnail of your video a clickbait. ",

            "answer_text": "First, if you\u2019re just starting out, take a look at our guide to creating a YouTube channel from scratch. It\u2019s a lot of work but it\u2019s also a clean slate. And, to help you save time, we\u2019ve compiled a list of beginner tips for YouTube. And now, in order from easiest to most complicated, our best practices for converting viewers into subscribers. Don\u2019t tackle them all at once. Try out one of these tips for each new video you post, or implement one a week. Here we go. 1. Ask your viewers to subscribe: I told you we\u2019re starting with the easiest ones first. Sometimes your audience just needs to be reminded. The big red subscribe button is omnipresent, but you might also want to point out the bell beside it that turns on notifications for your new videos. Simple. Does this tip seem too salesy to you? This is your reminder that you\u2019ve got valuable content, and you\u2019re just making it easier for them to keep up with the work you do. If you\u2019re already doing this, some idea: https://cheaplikesubscribers.com/p...ube-subscribers/ remember to demonstrate why your channel is worth subscribing to. And make sure you do it right when they love you the most (e.g., right after you\u2019ve provided new and useful information, or you\u2019ve made them laugh). Don\u2019t do it too much, or you\u2019ll risk turning people off. 2. End your videos by mentioning the one you\u2019re working on next: Subscribing to a YouTube channel is an act of anticipation. Viewers who\u2019ve just seen what your brand is about are primed to want more, if you\u2019ve done your job right. Hyping your next video, and making it clear why it\u2019s not to be missed, is the most organic way to encourage people to tap subscribe. Of course, this requires having a good handle on your content schedule, and knowing what\u2019s coming next. (More on that soon.) 3. Interact with your audience and make friends: If you form relationships with your viewers, they\u2019re more likely to want to keep watching your work. Respond to comments. Follow their channels back. Yes, it\u2019s exciting if a famous YouTuber comments on your video, but who knows who\u2019ll be famous next year. Form a community of peers and promote each other. (Yes, I\u2019m talking about shine theory.) Also, once you\u2019re plugged in, your audience will provide you with plenty of free content ideas for your next video. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to take all of them. 4. Update your channel art: Your YouTube banner welcomes everyone who clicks over to check out your channel. Maybe they just watched a video and are looking for more. Maybe they\u2019re a potential subscriber. Put your best foot forward. Your banner needs to be clean, on-brand, compelling, and\u2014this is the fussy part\u2014optimized for all devices. You don\u2019t want important details covered up by your social media buttons, for instance. We have a handy guide for creating your own YouTube channel art, along with free templates with the most up-to-date dimensions. 5. Brand your thumbnails: A thumbnail is a 1280 x 720px still image that acts as a cover for your video. And they are also your first, best chance to persuade people to click on your video. (Aside from your video titles, that is, but more on that later.) While some might advocate using the most \u201ceye-catching\u201d design (which seems to mean screaming red capslock over a man\u2019s shocked face and a picture of a\u2026 tomato?), one size does not fit all on YouTube. But we aren\u2019t here to earn cold views. To convert a viewer into a subscriber, take a look at your videos page. What does a new viewer see? Sleek, professional and consistent videos that imply an ongoing commitment to quality? Or a random mish-mash competing for attention? You want to aim for consistent branding in all your thumbnails. Use the same font, the same colour palette, or even the same frame composition so people know (at least subconsciously) that they\u2019re looking at a video from your channel. For instance, John Plant has built his survivalist Primitive Technology channel up to 9.9 million subscribers with understated, minimalist thumbnails. They\u2019re not loud, but they are consistent. And most importantly, they\u2019re clickable ",

Another thing is don\u2019t just record your screen all the time ,based upon the type of content you are providing sometimes you should also be willing to put yourself infront of a camera. I say this because ,most of the videos on youtube are screen recorded, people don\u2019t get a chance to recognize you if you do the same .Put yourself infront of a camera , your first video might be annoying ,but it really does\u2019t matter , they are here for the information . The first video in front of a camera might not give you a good following , but if you keep doing it people start recognizing you from your previous videos. The count starts increasing day by day .

The answer is making videos on things people are searching for or that you know people will be interested in. This is difficult because you need to, in a sense, predict what people will want to watch which isn't easy but can be done. You can narrow ideas down a little bit by deciding what types of videos you want to make such as gaming, vlogs, news, trends, etc. Once you find what you want to make videos on, this becomes easier. Once you get s few videos that are getting a lot of traffic then it becomes easier to grow and gain subscribers. Is this really \u201ceasy\u201d? No. But that's because there isn't really any fast and easy way to gain LEGITIMATE subscribers. Again, do not fall into the hype about buying views or subscribers because it doesn't benefit you at all like these companies want you to believe. ",

There is no shame in asking your followers to help you to get you to a target subscriber number be it 1k, 10k, 100k or 500k. Attach some offer or gift with your campaign. It will work wonders!Buy \u2018em! Getting subscribers is like a domino effect. Once you get a sizable number in the rest come tumbling after.

On my amv channel i have videos with 500 views and videos with 300.000 views from recommended and being at the top on searches, while on the gaming channel i gain followers and views from reviewing new games people are interested in or making more detailed videos about games im interested in.

You have probably noticed that almost every YouTuber will remind you to subscribe and may even talk about their subscribers. They have a good reason for this. Subscribers are the best way to generate views for a video on a consistent basis quickly. If you have a large subscriber count, then you will get video views when you publish a video. More views will mean that YouTube is more likely to promote the video across the platform, which just leads to more views. Views are also a key metric when pitching advertisers, which means more money for the YouTuber. ",

Let\u2019s start with the very basic thing which is not any channel growing tips but will really help you - i. Never get demotivated and stop uploading. The day is gonna come soon. ii. Just don\u2019t spam in other videos about your link and your channel. There\u2019s a high chance that you will receive hate and people may report your channel. iii. It\u2019s not some quick-food recipe and it takes a lot of time. People who say that they gained 1000 subscribers in one week are already someone big or are lying. Know the facts first. Now, the main tips - i. Never disrespect the tags, title and descriptions choose them wisely and don\u2019t use other\u2019s name. ii. Install any extension which will help you (VidIQ & TubeBuddy-I prefer them and do it from any brand you trust) iii. Thumbnails are the main source that will attract viewers. So, make them wisely. iv. Keep the viewers engaged. v. Do anything that will make them see your video till the last and tell them to see any of your other related videos if you can. Thank You! Wish a successful career ahead on YouTube, ",

Finally, \"keep 'em coming!\"  YouTube viewers will come back if you're constantly offering new, fresh material on your channel.   One more thing:   I think your viewers will appreciate replies from you when they post comments, but don't \"return fire\" if you get negative posts.   Your personality will come through, and if you counter attack an angry poster, you'll lose viewers - no matter how off the wall the attacker was.

Do you have a website? I think that would help you on your endeavor. How about Twitter? This is an idea I haven\u2019t tried, but it could work in an experimental fashion. Go to Twitter, find someone to follow who has similarities of what you\u2019re YouTubing, the one you follow could possibly lead you to more like minded individuals. Keep this up for a while and see how far it takes you, start interacting with these folks, if you had a site to bring them back to that would be great, but you may be able to bring them straight to your channel. Make sure you have good shit on your channel before you bring a bunch of folks to it, the name of the game is word of mouth. If you get 5 people who like your stuff, they go tell someone and so on etc\u2026, same holds true if it\u2019s bad, so make sure you\u2019ve got something worth showing first. Good Luck Robert ",

The advantage of doing online advertising is that Google, Facebook and many of the tech giants have already done the hard work for you. They have amassed user behavior from the statistics they collect through their search, social platforms etc. You as an individual needs to create compelling ads that will bring in the traffic to your channel. You may also consider advertising in Youtube also but I would suggest to use Google adwords, Facebook ads and others. I plan to gear up and do the very same thing and to put up posts on my art/tech website. Art Site by Ferdouse Khaleque Seek your inner potential Hope this helps a bit! ",

Ninth after you make a audience, make a community where your unity has its own interest. Example: like in gaming, the most common interest of the gamer is to PLAY, therefore you will be united as one in PLAYING GAMES.

In my opinion, you will be successful in gaining subscriber is to consistently upload your video no matter what. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Tejas, Good Morning Getting real YouTube Subscribers is a boon as they become your loyal viewers for a long time basis. The other way out is what many YouTube Creators do & which I find is unfair too is to go for the Sub4Sub Policy. You find them in Social Media Sites like Facebook. These subscribers which come are not loyal viewers & in a long time basis they won\u2019t remain with you. So, Sub4Sub is a sure no for me. Now coming back to your question, to get real subscribers the content of the video is the first & foremost thing. Concentrate on the video content if it is genuinely very catchy, then viewers would like it, share it among friends & subscribe to your channel. There is no other best alternative then that. Next, one more thing which we do is through your Social Media Back Up. For example, you have your list of friends but most of the time you are not in touch of the friends of your friends. Now when you create something good which you really want to share, tagging your friends helps. Even you can post in various Facebook Groups (related to your video content). And lastly, the most important thing is create a good \u201cCall to Action\u201d speech in your videos telling them to subscribe & press the bell icon so that they regularly get updates of your videos. Tell them to like & comment in the video. These activities creates engagement with your viewers which really in a long run will provide you viewers who will stay in your channel. Hope this answer helps you, best of luck. And don\u2019t forget to follow me on Quora & upvote this answer. And whenever you have some free time, you can visit my YouTube Channel. I follow the same policies. You can check them out, even my videos for the call to action part. We can chit chat there via comments too & can help you.

What makes you more fun to watch and to come back for more. Are you more talented, is what your doing different or the way your doing it different?

I\u2019ve uploaded (decent) content on a regular basis, and asked people to subscribe and shared it with friends. But the most important thing I\u2019ve found is branding yourself and your channel - give it a meaning or a purpose. For me that was focusing on what I love, art and photography. If you want to see an example:  Here\u2019s my brand new intro video. You can see on my channel I\u2019ve chosen a specific brand, topic, and style to pursue. This helps when people see one video they like because when they visit your channel they see more similar videos. ",

This works very well if you already know someone who has a following on social media because it is free and will help you gain lots of followers. Another free method you can use is becoming more involved in other places (like Quora, for example) because then you can gain credibility and be able to add links to you channel (like this one to mine).

Step 3: share your videos with others through blogs, social media, paid ads, etc. (don\u2019t be spammy when promoting). Step 4: make more awesome videos. The process is pretty simple. The tricky bit is making good videos that people enjoy watching. The best strategy for that is to make lots of videos and keep looking for ways to improve your content. The more content you have out there, the more chances you have of creating that \u2018perfect storm\u2019 of content and timing that goes viral and radically grows your audience. Plus, on YouTube, the audience gives you feedback. Listen and respond to comments. Ask questions. Pay attention to videos that receive strong positive and negative responses. Then, use that feedback to guide you when creating future videos. The more you understand your audience, the easier it gets to know what they will respond to. ",

Good quality content does not necessarily mean using high end recording equipment or insane editing skills(although it will help a lot) but the content you create must be appealing enough to the audience that they would want to come back to your channel every now and then to get quality content and thus get value. Once you are creating quality content your subscriber count will start increasing,now you can share your youtube video on instagram,facebook or other social networking sites to bring traffic from there to your youtube channel. If you have the capacity to and are willing to spend some bucks on promotions you can utilize Instagram\u2019s advertising system. It works great. Another key point is to use youtube to its full potential.Youtube,along with being a platform for content creators is also a social network,so you should be using it like one.

For viral content like best TikToks, they will be found by people in their YouTube \u201crecommended\u201d. Not by searching. Hence, loading the title with keywords is just unattractive.Focus on 10-minute+ videos. YouTube likes watch time. You won\u2019t get recommended much with 4-minute videos.Remove the small text in the videos. Nobody can read it, especially on mobile. But people will feel they\u2019re \u201cmissing\u201d something by not being able to read it. This will disengage people scrolling, so they\u2019ll scroll past!The above tips to you apply for any small creator. They\u2019re really important. ",

            "answer_text": "I give advice with FREE TRAFFIC orientation and in accordance with Youtube policy. You may have heard that you have to be good at SEO or make content that is TREND. I agree, but the most important thing that many people forget is the video content. The video may not be good, but it must be valuable, solving the problem of the audience. And when making videos, maybe you don't have much experience. No problem, try to do your best. I firmly believe that at some point, your video will be good and valuable. So the most important issue is that the video content has been resolved. However, just making good videos is not enough. Because suppose, you have a very nice or very valuable item, but if you do not \"show\" to others, they do not know. Similarly, if the video is good, the value you don't share, the audience won't know. In short, create valuable videos, do the best you can and share them with your audience through social networking platforms. Absolutely, no comment calls for crossover subscribe. Good luck. ",

I\u2019d say the best thing to do is to make sure that your videos look visually appealing in the sense that your camera isn\u2019t of a super low resolution. Of course, don\u2019t purchase super expensive lighting and camera equipment if you cannot afford it, but on the off chance that you can afford it then do so. Otherwise, just buy a cheaper camera and simple lighting that you find in your house. Maybe just set up your camera outside or by a window where you\u2019re bound to get good lighting. I think people underestimate the value of a good setup. ",

Quality Content - A video worth making (good script or information) Good lighting, well captured video and audio. 2. Evoke Emotion - be it any emotion; Happy, Sad, Anger, Sympathy, or Fear if you can evoke emotions of the viewers then they will end up liking/sharing it or atleast your video will remain in their mind instead of fading away. 3. Target trending topics - Be it Modi government or Tanmay Bhat's Snapchat (You can give out your perspective, unheard facts on it or make a rant or funny mockery of it), it should be something which people are constantly taking and searching about. You will end it getting new viewers. 4. Be Consistent - If you want to sustain in long run rather than hibernating for years after publishing 1 or 2 videos then upload consistently. Now this does not mean everyday (Quality over quantity), let your audience know when to expect your new video whether it's going to be weekly or monthly just make a schedule, announce it publicly and then stick to it. Congratulations, you now have the ingredients to make it big on YouTube. Good luck \u270c ",

Gaming is pretty popular and it is the most popular on youtube. Gaming is risky but rewarding. Keep in mind that you\u2019ll have either friends in the gaming community or enemies that you\u2019ll have to watch out for. You can also do video essays, which is another popular topic and videos can be getting millions of views for the persons opinion on it. Most of the people in the Youtube essay video community are friendly and like to collaborate with each other. Diy channels are not as popular, but this route should only be taken if you have pro diy/makeup skills. ",

Same as above. How to videos. Look for the most searchable stuff and do your own niche on it. Comment on other videos from small to mid creators for people to see your comment.

But I found out, this is not the case. So I started doing research and found there is a certain science to it that you have to discover and use. So do some research, find what people are looking for and use those keywords in your videos. Also look to what other people are doing in your genre. I hope this helped. Sincerely, Dwayne. ",

Which in turn can make you the central figure of authority on that topic. When that's in place there several ways to enhance your subscribe rate. Telling the audience to subscribe to keep getting your value is one. Be creative about it. It's what YouTube is for anyway. Have fun and enjoy the ride. Hope it helps ",

I say \u201cless cheap\u201d because there\u2019s sometimes an expense the collaboration, like travel, props, additional equipment upgrades, etc.. Still, the benefits are exposure through someone else\u2019s network. If there\u2019s enough overlap in your audience\u2019s interest, you can count on some increased traffic. Not cheap and less best way: Buy ad space. I mean buy ad space, not spam forums or chats or comments on other people\u2019s videos. That crap just makes you look like some desperate fool with nothing of quality people actually want to see (we\u2019ll call that the cheapest and worst way).

I posted regularly as in the times a week, I commented on other helicopter related channels and their commenters could see from my thumbnail profile pic I was related to helicopters so some of them clicked on my image and came to my channel and subscribed. Once you have a decent library of videos YouTube groups all of your videos and suggests them to your viewers on the right side. So if you find one of my videos chances are many if not all the suggestions of other helicopter videos down the rights side of your screen are also mine so it keeps you on my channel. If you find a fascinating one you most likely will share it to your social media and your friends will in turn watch it and some may subscribe. It take a time. It took three long years and 187 videos to get my channel earning money. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer entirely depends on who your audience is, from category to age. Most mid-teens will like humour over fact, but that tends reverse as the ages progress. If you're vlogging, try and keep it under the 10 min mark so people don't lose their attention quick. If you're broadcasting news, the most successful news channel is on the serious/humour borderline.  And if you're trying to amuse people doing challenges or pranks seem to be the most effective way. I cannot say this for all channels but the majority have some form of humour in it. However keeping that in mind the most important rule is to upload good content weekly and or daily. Posting an 'ok' video once every 3 weeks won't get you very far. ",

Let me save you some time by telling some points which I have learnt Content - We cannot strongly stress on this. Content needs to be unique -either in the matter, the way of talking, visuals anything. Something to make you stand apart.Schedule - Release the videos at a set standard. Youtube algos reward channels that follow a fixed schedule. Even if you have lot of videos, do not get tempted to dump all of htem .Instead schedule them and let youtube see that u follow a certain schedule. In the beginning, it may seem that we can do a lot. but u need to stick to this until atleast u reach a sizable amount of subscribersDo not get tempted to Sub for sub. You may get subscribers but this doesnt help in the long run as the sub for sub accounts will never watch your content. They are not genuinely interested in your content.We need organic growthPatience - We need to keep doing the videos until youtube pushes us.This may take a long time but we need to keep at it. It may seem frustrating and demotivating at more times than one but plough throughHope these help :) Remember the top youtubers(unless they are already well known) started with a couple of subscribers.

Also, no one promotes your video for free. So you have to promote your video. You have to spend time and money in promoting your content. Study how your videos are getting views, analyze, Select the topics which have more views in a period of time. For doing all this, you need to have a team, or you need to have a great topic, which is viral. Its a difficult job.

Have faith in you and your content / ideas. You'll grow. Not now but laterRespect your audience, this is an important factor where many famous people too failNever judge your channel by numbers. Subscriber base must be qualitative not quantitive.Be constant. If you're posting 4 videos in a week, then no matter what you have to maintain it. The audience waits for you!Improve yourself on a regular basis and move along with the trend. Either you make your own trend too :pHope to see you grow! \u263a\ufe0f Good day. ",

My best advice i can give you dont post all your videos at once. Set a time each week or day you post by a do it. Consistency is key. Also when you first start your not gonna have anyone who will be able to see your videos so post lots of comments upvoting other channels and hoping they gove you a shoutout or meet up and get in their videos. Make sure you dont target someone with very few subscribers though. This wont help your cause. Good luck! ",
