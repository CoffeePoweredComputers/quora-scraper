            "answer_text": "It depends on your long term goal, your definition of \"worth\", and what your options are.  First and foremost, whatever you do make it something that fascinates you.  Make sure it is something about which you are curious and makes you excited. I find the area of search fascinating and I am fortunate to have been given the opportunity to work professionally with search daily.  However, note that I have a Masters in Slavic Linguistics, not in IR, and I did not start out professionally in search. If your goal is to make a living someone is going to have to pay for your education.  Either you'll have to pay to go to school or a company will have to pay while you learn. I have been fortunate.  As my company's needs for search has grown so has my knowledge/experience.  They've been paying me along the way to learn/do search along with other things so it's been worth the investment.  Now I'm one of the lead search people at our company and spend most of my time on search and big data-related efforts. You may not be as fortunate as I am.  Usually, a company that posts a job for an IR position will want someone with IR experience and will want you to hit the ground running.  Without that experience, professional or educational, a company will have to pay you while you figure it out.  They may not want to delay their return on investment.  You could also find a non-IR position with a company that already does IR and make your way over to the IR team to start your education. If your goal is not employment/income but to learn more about IR and have the opportunity, working on a Masters could be a great way to achieve that goal.  We are living in the age of data and I see the amount of data growing, not shrinking.  There will always be the need to pull meaning out of that data and IR is a key part of that.  If you decide to leave academia I doubt you will have problems moving on to other opportunities. ",
