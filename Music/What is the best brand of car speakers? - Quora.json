            "answer_text": "There is not such a thing as the best car speakers for various reasons: What is good sound for you, may not be the same what for me is sound quality. You can get the most expensive loudspeakers in a car and they may still sound like crap  (Genesis) You can have the same set of speakers in two cars and they will probably sound completely different   (Scan Speak) There are plenty of high end audio brands, but you need to achieve the best \"synergy\" between your components and the the best positioning for the speakers, for each car, each case.   (Focal) If the source is of a lower quality, the speakers alone will actually do worst. The \"better\" the speaker, the more you will be able to notice the \"imperfections\" of the other components in your system.  (ZR Speaker Lab) I could be here for a long time posting brands like Morel, Dynaudio, Sonus Faber, Pioneer, McIntosh, Feastrex, Transmission Audio, Ground Zero, Audison, etc, etc... What you should do is listen to a few and buy the ones that will sound the best to YOU.  ",
