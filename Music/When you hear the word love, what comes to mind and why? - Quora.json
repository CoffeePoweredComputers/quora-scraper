            "answer_text": "My friend once told me that love is when you like someone over a year without having to see them. Three years ago when I was still in Belgium(two months before returning to Japan), I decided to talk to the people in my class whom I never had talked to. Amongst those people, there was one guy who I did not like. He was violent, arrogant, and loud. Not my type. I was scared of him and physically unable to befriend him. (Like once when he walked towards me in the hall, my body instinctively took a boxing defense pose) However, I made my decision. So I started to talk to him. Gradually, I became used to his presence. I also noticed his inner kindness. He wasn't the jerk I thought he would be. Yes, he was violent and would hit girls(Literal meaning), but he never actually hurt anyone. He was just being playful, and oddly enough, he was pretty popular among the girls. My feelings started changing. I had never thought he was attractive, but now I did. I had never thought I would be writing notes to him during class, but now I did. I had never thought I would be so excited to go to school, but now I did. I had never thought I would feel so happy because of someone, and now I did. I was in love. By the time I had to leave Belgium, I was madly in love. I didn\u2019t now how I could survive without being able to see him. I wrote him a letter a week before leaving. I never expected him to reply but he did. He handed me a letter on my last day at school. I still have it, locked safely in my treasure box. Even after I came back to japan, my feelings never changed. I had to tell myself that I would be able to meet him someday in order to keep me going. I felt a sadness I had never felt before. I read his letter over and over, every day to keep myself going.This went on for about two years. As of now, I don\u2019t feel that necessity to meet him, but if I ever meet him again, I know that the burning sensation I used to feel for him will come back. To me, Love is many things. Love is happiness, sadness, trust, unpredictable, and eternal. p.s. Sorry for the long answer hehe. ",

            "answer_text": "On Love, from The Prophet, by Khahil Gibran: When love beckons to you, follow him, Though his ways are hard and steep. And when his wings enfold you yield to him, Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you. And when he speaks to you believe in him, Though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden.For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning. Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself. He threshes you to make you naked. He sifts you to free you from your husks. He grinds you to whiteness. He kneads you until you are pliant; And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you may become sacred bread for God's sacred feast. All these things shall love do unto you that you may know the secrets of your heart, and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life's heart. But if in your fear you would seek only love's peace and love's pleasure, Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love's threshing floor,Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears. Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself, Love possesses not nor would it be possessed: For love is sufficient unto love. When you love you should not say, \"God is in my heart,\" but rather, \"I am in the heart of God.\" And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course. Love has no other desire but to fulfill itself. But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires: To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night. To know the pain of too much tenderness. To be wounded by your own understanding of love; And to bleed willingly and joyfully. To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving; To rest at the noon hour and meditate love's ecstasy; to return home at eventide with gratitude; And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips.

            "answer_text": "That's a question that requires a lot of thought. Love is a verb, an action. Not a feeling. Joy is the feeling just as often as fear, or anger, or caring, or greif. If I had a wife and she told me that she was so sick she wasn't going to work, I could say \u201calright dear I'll call ya'\u201d. And unless I sensed that she just needed a day off from it all, I'm not slgiving her my love. Love would be me saying whatever and leaving. Coming fight back in and saying \u201c Just kidding\u201d and then calling my boss and chewing him out 'cause I'm not going to work. Again I'd be playing, because I already called work off when she wasn't looking. Now I can pamper her and let her get rest while I do yard work or fix the car. Cleaning the house is a definite. And that is love. So what do I think when I hear the word, LOVE? I think of LIFE , and what I've been through. Because good or bad, we all been youched by LOVE. Get you some if you can. ",

Many people, at least in my experience, think that if you love someone, you might want a relationship or sex. If you ask me this is not true; you can love a friend for who they are, that does not mean you want to marry them. For example, sat there was a boy. He has a girlfriend, and a girl best friend. One day while with hos girlfriend, he receives a text from his girl best friend, pulls out his phone, and replies with a heart, or says i love you. The girlfriend instantly assumes he is cheating or wants a relationship with the girl best friend. In reality he does not, he just loves who she is as a person. I think i have an uncommon thought when i hear the word love, and an even more uncommon opinion of love, but that\u2019s just who i am. ",

I will say this though however it manifests in your life, it's something to be treasured. You need to know the difference between love and obsession. You also need to know when it's toxic either giving or receiving and pull back so that it doesn't destroy you or the person you care about. I'm not saying don't put yourself out there because that's how you find love. I'm saying take it slow. ",

But whether there are prophecies, they will fail; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, it will vanish away. 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part. 10 But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away. 11 When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. 12 For now we see in a mirror, darkly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known. 13 And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.
