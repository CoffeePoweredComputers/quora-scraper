            "answer_text": "Hmmmm, Soft, hard and insane? True story. I had an audition with a band claiming to be a classic rock band. The worse audition I ever went to. I\u2019ve been to 3 pretty bad ones over the years. Bad for different reasons. But mainly because the bands were horrendously bad! Answered a post on Craigslist \u201cLooking for Lead Guitar replacement for a Classic Rock band that\u2019s been together for 20 years.\u201d I get there with a Strat or PRS, not sure, and a Marshall. I mean, it\u2019s Classic Rock, right? Just brought one guitar because it\u2019s just an audition. First I had to haul the gear into their basement. Narrow stairway. And no one offered to help. So I make 3 trips up and down a flight of stairs, back and forth to the END of the driveway! Amp, guitar and gear, pedal board, etc.. Second, it\u2019s a small room in the basement. SMALL! Maybe 16 x 16, with LOW ceiling! And I\u2019m over 6\u2032 tall! No windows. Just the stairway. Third, they ALL freaking smoked like chimneys! I mean, if you smoke, fine. If you allow 4 or 5 people in your home to smoke, that\u2019s up to you. But 6 people crammed into this teeny place, and 5 of them smoking!?! Forth . . . When I walked in I immediately recognized the keyboard player and his wife. And the band! The band was a full blown Country band! I look at the keys player when I first saw him and said, I thought you guys were a Country band. He says, \u201cYeah, we\u2019ve been together about 20 years as a Country band but decided we want to start playing classic Rock instead.\u201d Fifth, no bass player. They kept saying he was coming, just running late. We started at 1pm, and at 4:30, he shows up, after I just want to go home! They kept saying to please stay till he gets there because he\u2019s so good he pulls the whole band together. So I stayed. Basically, this was the rehearsal that was going to magically turn them into a Classic Rock band from a Country band. Their other guitarist was ok, but not a Rocker! They figured, add a Rock lead player, and they\u2019ll sound like a Classic Rock band. They did not! Further more, while they\u2019re trying to figure out how to play some Rock songs, they keep looking to me to get the songs going, etc.. With no bass. And the keys player was honestly, horrible! His wife was the lead singer of the band. And ALL Country! Let\u2019s just say she needed a few more notes. The 2 or 3 she used for all the songs left her short! Hey, I just thought of a new saying . . . She\u2019s 3 notes short of a full melody! LOL Finally . . . sixth and lastly . . . the bass player shows up after 3 1/2 hours of this crap. I think I stayed more out of curiosity than anything else. My wife was out of state for a few days, and I had some time to kill. And besides, I WAS playing! He apologizes while setting up. We start playing. Now with the bass player that\u2019s going to pull it all together! And this guy was a Country, oompa pa band, to notes per measure, thumb hanging over the neck to play the botton string, Polka and Country old world bass thumper! UUUGGGGGHHHHH! We play a ballad, he\u2019s playing Bum,bum, Bum bum thru the whole thing! Go to a faster Country song. He plays the same thing. But at least it \u201cfit\u201d the song. Then we do some rock n roll thing, like Johnny B Good or something like that, and he plays . . . the same thing! Bum,bum, Bum bum, Bum,bum, Bum bum . . . . OK, now here\u2019s why I answered this question . . . All while working out songs, false starts, figuring out intros, outros, chord changes, bridges, etc., there\u2019s this BIG guy, with a full set of Ludwig Rockers, and a bunch of cymbals, huge drum sticks, buzzed hair, beer drinking and smoking the whole time, in this teeny room, and this guy is literally POUNDING on the drums. Gigantically LOUD! Seriously, the guy was playing so loud, everyone had to play loud. If I wasn\u2019t right by one of the PA speakers, I wouldn\u2019t hear a word she sang. It was obvious these people all knew nothing about professionally playing anything. In the tiny room it was unbearable! So after a few songs I ask the drummer if he could please lighten up! If he played hard all the time, there was no dynamics. No build ups. And he says . . . \u201cI play one way. LOUD!\u201d The practice session was HORRIBLE! Yeah, they seemed to think it went great. I tear down and load all the gear myself. No help. As I load my amp into my van, the drummer comes up to me as says . . . \u201cWell, what do you think?\u201d I said \u201cAbout what?\u201d He says . . . \u201cThe band! You wanna join us?\u201d I politely said . . . I don\u2019t think we\u2019re a match. PS: One of the other 2 \u201cworst auditions\u201d I ever did was about a year later for another band needing a lead player. I showed up, and it\u2019s the same keyboard player! That\u2019s as far as I\u2019ll go into that scenario! ",

            "answer_text": "A lot depends on what you mean by \u201cPercussion Instruments\u201d. If you mean ALL percussion instruments, including drum kits, then you already have two very good answers. As a \u201cpercussionist\u201d as opposed to a \u201cdrummer\u201d, I would just briefly like to touch upon the subtleties of the term\u2026.. A drummer tends to \u201clead\u201d, counting in the rhythm, holding a steady tempo for others to follow, whereas a percussionist will follow, listening to what is being played and adding little bits here and there As a fellow percussionist once told me that, in the meal that is music, the drummer is the T-bone in the middle of the plate. It provides a foundation round which the meal is built. The percussionist is the herbs and spices. (S)He adds a certain flavour which can\u2019t be achieved by any other means. From a quiet clave on the off beat, just to gently keep the rhythm alive, to a thrashing tambourine to add further top-end excitement to the fast sections, it is a very different approach, listening and responding. Hope this helps you. ",
