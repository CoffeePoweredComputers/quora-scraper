            "answer_text": "That would be a definite yes/no/sort of Most people think of ballads these days as slow songs, especially based around the theme of love. Traditionally ballads are songs that tell stories, often intricate ones. Bohemian rhapsody is a ballad It starts as a slow song song thus meeting the much accepted meaning of the word. The rocky part deals with the relationship problems the narrator faces when abandoned, and although the music is heavy, thematically it fits the bill of a ballad. The song tells a story of wrongdoing, guilt, judgement, abandonment and acceptance of fate. It\u2019s a typical murder ballad. Bohemian rhapsody is not a ballad BR isn\u2019t a simple love song. In fact it\u2019s uncertain it deals with the ideals it claims to at all. The protagonist tells his mother a secret and faces a judgement for it, from others it himself. But it\u2019s not a story, it\u2019s an allegory. The situation is not a linear story of love and rejection but a series of self-doubt thoughts about the sexuality of the narrator. There\u2019s no external love or story involved. The operatic and rock sections are so clearly at odds to any definition of ballad that this undermines the idea that is one. Bohemian rhapsody is sort of a ballad An amalgamation of both the above gives the clear definitive answer of, sort of. The song fulfils many elements of a ballad and rejects others. Partly this depends on how you interpret the lyric. I would argue that the song - which includes pop, soft rock, hard rock, and opera, and has a lyrical content that could be a story of murder, trial and punishment, a typical 70s singer songwriter self doubt, tortured soul issue, a coming out metaphor, or a nonsense set of words - can not be identified as any single genre. The above listed parts are not all mutually exclusive, and I suspect parts of all were intended. So parts are very much a ballad, whereas others not so. This song is so different to anything before it since that identifying it as any specific genre is not only impossible, but ultimately not useful. ",
