            "answer_text": "One can only speak for themselves since one guy's answer might be different from another, including my own. The 'first move' can mean various different things, and does not necessarily mean being asked out. Moreover, being asked out on date does not mean going steady either.  Maybe I'm one of the luckier guys out there, but I've had many women make the first move on me, by inviting me to do things like go bowling or dancing with them. Also, many times a women who likes me will tell her friend/s to tell me to either ask her out, or at least tell me that she likes me. However, it's very rare for a women to actually ask me out on a date, though it happens occasionally. I don't expect a woman to ask me out, but I do love it when they make it easy for me to ask them out. 'Signals' are not a first move as I've learned that every woman is different. Signals also do not place the woman in the same situation that the guy is in. I can tell you one thing, that if how you attain a relationship is held in higher regards over ending up with a compatible mate, the relationship probably does not have a strong foundation to begin with. I've always questioned why some people consider how you initiate a relationship to be more important than actually finding the easiest way possible to be with a compatible partner in a relationship where you both would make each other happy. Life is already challenging enough, and filled with plenty of hardships as it is, so why turn dating into a dogma? I had never understood the tradcon mindset on this one, or their willingness to bully others who don't conform to their way of thinking. ",
