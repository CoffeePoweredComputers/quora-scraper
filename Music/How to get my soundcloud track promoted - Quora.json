            "answer_text": " It isn't easy to get to the top especially when you are still a newbie and eager to make your song promoted. If music is your passion, you should get this into a business. Let me share some tips to promote your Soundcloud music. Use Tag The best way to promote your music is through tags. Tagging makes your music discoverable when a listener is searching for songs on SoundCloud. If you have music in genre drum and bass, just tag as #drum&bass, and otherwise. To make it more detailed to your listener you can add location too. Make sure to put only one genre to make your tracks findable. This makes sure your music is easy to discover. Promote Your Music On Social Media SoundCloud enables you to connect your music to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, YouTube, and Instagram as well. Be active on social media, promote your SoundCloud seriously there and bring more fans from it. Several ways you can use to do promotion on social media such as make polls using Instagram, make use of free downloads, discounted merchandise, tickets to gigs, and other incentives. Besides that, engage firmly with people. Hold contests, offer giveaways or meet-and-greets, or backstage passes for your next songs. Share Tracks Privately Before Your Release It's good to have connections with other musicians or collaborators. Since SoundCloud lets you share private links to your tracks, in my opinion, you can share the unfinished tracks with collaborators or sending demos to labels or blogs. Sharing a private link gives the music a personal touch and a sense of exclusivity that is perfect for the tastemakers out there. A simple step: upload tracks, set to private, save it and hit the share button. And voila, you will see a private share URL that is unique to your track. Know Where Your Target Market Is You can target them either online or offline. You can find out where your potential listener by learn more about who your listeners are and their preferences and demographics. Where to find them? You can find them by using Soundcloud go Pro or Google analytics. It is one of the free analytics programs. They can tell everything from where your listeners are, to their age to their interests. From here, you know who is your target listener and you can plan out anything from your next release to your next tour, or even to when you should promote your songs. Apart from that, you too can look them on online platforms. So you can see not only what your potential fans want, but where they live and what they do and how they engage with the web. These places include: SoundCloud (obviously)MixcloudYouTube8tracksRedditLastly, you can get your track promoted by seeking help from a marketing site to help promote your music and get it more plays, likes, and repost. Let them settle the promotion part and what you need to do is focus on making quality music. Boost social credibility and make your song look very popular. This will attract more people to listen to it, help your music reach a larger audience and build you a fan base. I hope this would be much of a help! ",

            "answer_text": "These are the experiences I have gained to get my soundcloud track promoted 1. Promote your SoundCloud profile on social media. Create separate artist accounts on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram and update them regularly. There, you can drop links to new songs, post about exciting projects you\u2019ve got in the works, and interact with your fans and followers directly. Social media is without a doubt the single best way to market yourself and your music online.[16] Invite your friends to share your posts on their own profiles. The more ears your music reaches, the larger your network or potential followers will grow. Be sure to link your social media accounts to your SoundCloud profile, as well  2. Submit your work to music blogs. Run a search for blogs that are on the lookout for new music. Being featured on a popular site just one time can send your number of followers skyrocketing. Not only that, you\u2019ll enjoy added credibility as an artist since your work comes backed by the blog\u2019s reputation. Focus on blogs that feature music from your preferred genre. Small niche blogs, while they don\u2019t command as wide an audience, are often more willing to post material from lesser known artists.[18] Include a short message along with your submission explaining who you are and why you\u2019re writing: \u201cA friend recently told me about your blog and mentioned that you feature experimental metal music. I just put the finishing touches on a post-metal/drone track that I think would fit in perfectly with the rest of your content. I\u2019ve included a link at the bottom of this email. Let me know what you think!\u201d 3. Be active on internet groups and forums. Get involved in discussions with like-minded creators and fans with whom you can share your passion for music. Since listening is a hobby for these people, you won\u2019t have to twist any arms to get them to check out your work. Forums and internet groups are some of the best places to get honest feedback from someone with an experienced ear. 4.Social Proofs Normal ones usually ignore this, but they don\u2019t know that they missed one of the most important things in getting popular. So my sincere advice is \u201cplease, don\u2019t put it aside!\u201d. Well, let\u2019s get to know how to boost your social proofs! The easiest and fastest way to accomplish this is making a purchase from an online marketing company. From my experience, one of trusted providers is AudienceGain. They have professional users everywhere around the world who will promote your music through their internal network \u2013 boosting your credibility and social proof quickly. I've bought from them many times since last year and I have not gotten any problems till now. You know what? Many people always say that this is just a waste of money, but the reason why they said that is because they don\u2019t know exactly what its real effect is. Its real effect is that it can raise your credibility with your audiences, make you look popular and so become more attractive to audiences. Thanks to that, you can totally get more people to know about your soundtracks and hit the button of like and follow. ",

            "answer_text": "You must to do that. If you don\u2019t promote your track to everyone so how can your track become famous. I\u2019m going to share some tips to execute promote own track and page.  1. Purchase SoundCloud Plays, Repost. Getting your tracks played more is indispensable for drawing new followers. People are inclined to listen to your tracks if they see plenty of other people listening. A smart way to achieve that boost is to purchase SoundCloud plays. There are many companies available online that offer different plays packages. Some providers can deliver 1000 plays for as low as $3, see our reviews of the top providers to find the best deal for you. Carefully research each provider before purchasing SoundCloud plays. Go beyond the prices and look into the quality of other services they have. You should also consider the additional services they offer, like followers and likes. By the way, i'm going to share you a service that i'm using to buy plays and other services because they have had event Buy 1 Get 1 Free. I bought many plays of them and nothing any problems hapenning. I think it's the good provider to refer. 2. Comment on related SoundCloud tracks Connecting with other SoundCloud artists within your niche is an effective way to build a network for attracting more followers. Commenting on their tracks is one of the most basic ways to do this. It also makes you more visible to other artists\u2019 listeners, drawing them to your tracks. The key to making this strategy helpful is leaving high-quality comments that would lead to a conversation between you and the track\u2019s owner and fans. Feel free to comment about their track\u2019s technical aspects or other topics that would be of interest to them. Do it in a constructive manner to leave a positive impression and encourage them to respond. Once you have set up an ongoing conversation with other artists and their audience, you will inevitably draw them to your own music. When directing them back to your tracks, make the action a part of your conversation. You can, for instance, present your tracks as a reference for them. This encourages them to see what you offer. 3. Connect with bloggers Reaching out to music bloggers can increase the visibility of your music outside of SoundCloud and attract new followers. There are plenty of blogs out there that cater to your specific genre. These blogs are often on the lookout for new acts to feature, giving you a good opportunity to catch their interest. Talking to vloggers is just as important: When submitting your music to blogs, prepare a good pitch for it. Talk about any interesting stories behind your tracks or aspects of your music in general. This will make you stand out from other submissions that the blogger is reviewing. Having an impressive SoundCloud page is also important since you will be linking back to it in your pitch. Put your best tracks on the front of your profile for the blogger\u2019s benefit. You can also purchase some followers to boost your page\u2019s prominence and create a better initial impression on them. 4. Post on music forums and Subreddits While social media is the dominant online promotional channel for musicians nowadays, forums are still invaluable for drawing new SoundCloud followers. Reddit, in particular, remains a popular place for people to find new artists to follow. The site has dozens of active music subreddits, including one dedicated to SoundCloud. Before submitting your tracks to any forum, familiarize yourself with their posting rules. You also don\u2019t want your link posts to look spammy. Instead of just dropping your SoundCloud link, provide some context around it. You can talk about the inspirations behind the track or its technical aspects. This serves to pique readers\u2019 interest and get them to click the link. As it is with social media, engaging with other forum members is essential for making your SoundCloud page and tracks more visible. On Reddit, for example, actively responding to comments can improve your upvotes and place your posts higher in the post lists. Keep your engagements genuine and interesting to turn these upvotes into a real following. 5. Connect with influencers If you are promoting your SoundCloud page and tracks on Twitter, getting influencers to tweet your links will give you a big boost. One way to employ these influencers is through sponsored tweets. Here, you pay influencers to recommend you music to their followers. Sponsored tweet campaigns vary in cost depending on the popularity of the influencer and the scale of the campaign. To get the most out of sponsored tweets, you should have the right influencers. Look at how passionate they are about the kind of music you have. This will tell you how effective they are at promoting your music to their followers. Additionally, this can give you an idea of how receptive their followers will be to your tracks. 6. Make a music video Creating music videos is always an effective means of drawing attention to your SoundCloud tracks. Use your videos to cross-promote your Soundcloud page on other social media sites by adding a link back to your profile, or the featured track. ",

            "answer_text": "Music is your passion. If it were up to you, you\u2019d spend all your time writing and performing. But if music is also your business, you have to leave the studio and do some legwork to promote it. To help gain the most out of SoundCloud and reach the widest audience possible, I\u2019ve put together some tips and ideas that any musicians can easily implement:  1. Upgrade your Account First, let\u2019s assume that you\u2019ve covered the crucial basics on already having a profile for yourself or your band, and you have a professional-looking profile picture or logo as well as a solid and concise bio, and links to your website and social networks. Then, it can be well worth upgrading your account to one of the Pro options. Aside for the obvious benefits of being able to upload more music, it also gives you access to one of the most valuable tools an artist can have: data. Pro accounts give you extensive stats on where your music gets played from, which you can then use to market your music accordingly. 2. Engage In real life and in social media there is only one way to really gain meaningful strong relationships, and that is to get out there and mix it up with people. If you sit and watch from the sidelines, not much is going to happen. You need to use that mentality when growing your SoundCloud followers. So if you really want to be embraced by the SoundCloud community, you must contribute. Comment on other artists\u2019 tracks, repost them, favorite them, whatever you can do to engage with other users. Do this consistently for a while, 30 minutes a day, and see that great things can happen over the course of a couple of months. 3. The power of groups When like minded people get together, they can accomplish huge things, and also be an amazing resource for your music promotion. With hordes of people on the internet and social media, there are endless amounts of groups and networks which you can be a part of and share your music with. Some great examples are SoundCloud groups, Facebook groups, and Reddit. Aside from those big three, which will be more than enough to fill up your time, there are countless forums and other websites for sharing tunes. They two key critical factors for success with these are ENGAGE. Nobody wants to be around someone that only talks about themselves. So comment and engage with people about topics other than your music.Make sure you\u2019re picking the right groups that are relevant for your sound or genre. Said another way: don\u2019t join a trance group when you produce deep house4. Share on Other Platforms Since SoundCloud is a social music streaming service, you can find ways to integrate it with your other social networks. Whenever you post music on SoundCloud, be fervent about posting it on Twitter, Facebook, and any of your other social networks that your fans are actively paying attention to you. Not only will that get your play counts up, hopefully your fans using SoundCloud will interact with you by commenting and sharing your songs on it. Don\u2019t spam every single one of your new twitter followers with a direct message, but tweet about your track and include a link with a call to action if relevant, such as asking your followers to share the song if they like it. You can hire a 3rd website like BUILD MY SOCIALS - one of the TOP SOUNDCLOUD FOLLOWERS SUPPLIER to buy SoundCloud plays and followers. It\u2019s a great way of kickstarting a song. Instead of starting from zero plays, you can start from a few thousand and quickly put things in gear. Not everyone gets noticed quickly and some don\u2019t get the recognition they deserve at all. Make sure you promote your music the right way because doing nothing and hoping a lot of listeners will find you doesn\u2019t work anymore Try to click the website and experience how well it works! Finally, it\u2019s your turn to stand out and show the world what you \u2019ve made of. ",

We are continuously working to open up Premier to more and more artists, with the ultimate goal of opening up monetization opportunities for every artist. If you aren't yet part of Premier, you won't be able to monetize with SoundCloud for now - however we're working hard to build the infrastructure that enables us to expand the Premier offering across the globe. Promoting tracks is currently only a feature available with Soundcloud Premier, as highlighted there. ",
