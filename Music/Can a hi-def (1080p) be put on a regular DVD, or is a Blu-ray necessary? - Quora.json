            "answer_text": "Yes. Most Blu-ray players support the AVCHD format, which will allow you to burn HD content to a DVD. The caveat is that your playback time will be rather limited, as the largest capacity DVD is around 9GB versus 25GB for the smallest Blu-ray. If you want to extend playback time, you will have to compress your media further, which can introduce compression artefacts like macroblocking, aliasing and other things that look ugly. Generally speaking, you can get about an hour on a DVD9 in close to Blu-ray quality. If you\u2019re willing to drop down to 720p, you can get over 2 hours, but you will lose some detail. ",
