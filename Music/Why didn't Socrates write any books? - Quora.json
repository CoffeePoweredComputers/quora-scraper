            "answer_text": "No one will ever know why Socrates never wrote anything down for certain, but it is a question that has been bothering people for millennia. Iohannes Stobaios, a fifth-century AD compiler of ancient sources, includes an anecdote in Book 3, Chapter 21 of his book Anthology collected from an earlier biographical source about Socrates\u2019s alleged reply to this very question. Iohannes Stobaios states that someone once asked Socrates why he never wrote anything down and Socrates replied, \u201cBecause I see that material to write on is far more valuable than anything I might write.\u201d This anecdote is most likely apocryphal and the reason it gives is probably wrong, but it makes an interesting point. Both Plato and Xenophon, who were both Socrates\u2019s students, stress his humility. It is also true that, at the time when Socrates was alive, papyrus had to be imported from Egypt and was therefore relatively expensive. A far more likely explanation for why Socrates never wrote anything down, however, is that he simply did not feel it was the best teaching method. Classical Greece was very much an oral culture and most ideas were taught by word-of-mouth from teacher to student. It was only rarely that ideas were committed to papyrus. It is quite telling that Plato and Xenophon both chose to write about Socrates in form of dialogues, or written accounts of verbal discussions.  ABOVE: First-century AD Roman marble copy of a Greek bronze portrait head of Sokrates originally created in the fourth century BC by the sculptor Lysippos It is worth noting that Socrates was far from the only great philosopher of antiquity who never wrote anything down. Thales of Miletos (c. 624 \u2013 c. 546 BC), who is often credited with having been the first philosopher, never seems to have written anything down either and everything we know about him comes from later writers. Likewise, although ancient writers refer to writings attributed to Pythagoras of Samos (c. 570 \u2013 c.\u2009495 BC), no such writings have survived to the present day and scholars dispute whether any of the writings attributed to him in antiquity were authentic. Socrates was far from alone in not writing anything down. For those who are answering this question by saying that Socrates might not have existed, you should know that that is almost certainly wrong. Socrates certainly existed, as any classicist will tell you. For one thing, we have a contemporary hostile portrayal of him in Aristophanes\u2019s comedy The Clouds, which was first performed at the Great Dionysia in 423 BC when Socrates would have been around forty-seven years old. We also have the admiring portrayals of Socrates by Plato and Xenophon, both of whom had been Socrates\u2019s students while he was alive. While it is true that Plato uses Socrates as a character to express his own philosophical ideas, this only means that Plato\u2019s portrayal of Socrates is not always historically accurate; it does not in any way imply that Socrates himself might not have existed. The portrayal of Socrates in Plato\u2019s earlier dialogues is generally agreed to be more historically accurate than the portrayal in his later dialogues. Furthermore, Xenophon, who also wrote about Socrates, was not even much of a philosopher himself, but rather a historian, so we have no reason to suppose that Xenophon was just using Socrates as a character to make philosophical points. Socrates is also described by Aristotle, who was born long after Socrates\u2019s death and therefore never met him in person, but who was a student of Plato and would have doubtlessly heard a great deal about Socrates from his teacher. Clearly, our sources on Socrates are more than adequate enough to establish that he was a real person.  ABOVE: Presumed bust of Xenophon, a historian and student of Socrates who wrote about him ",

            "answer_text": "After watching all these wrong(not to say dangerously ignorant) answers below i am obliged to write a better answer. First of all to answer to Sarah Bowman any scholar who has studied about ancient Greece and Socrates knows that Socrates was a historical person.His life and teachings is documented without any doubt by multible trustworthy sources. Socrates was taught by Diotima who was a Pythagorean .Pythagoreans were iniciated and were bound to secrecy and they were never publishing books (with the exception of Philolaos who did on a time when Pythagoreans were attacked with difamation accusing them as ignorants. Philolaos then wrote a book and silenced all critics as he wrote a book that was 2000 years ahead of its time ) 1)Socrates highly esteemed Pythagoreans and therefore this might have been a reason why he also never wrote anything. 2)On the other side Socrates Talent was to act in dialogues .He could use his intuition and overpass any argument , or he would examine his opponents . Socrates needed a live opponent to express his Genius . It is difficult to write such dialogues for your self in your mind 3) a third reason is that Socrates was Humble. He did not pretend to be wise .He was teaching others by examining their logic or by quoting Pythagorean and Orphic myths .He would feel bad to pretend that he wrote something .It would have been against his character 4) But inorder to understand why Socrates might have not written/or published anything we have to understand why Pythagoreans almost never wrote anything. The deeper answer is that Truth cannot be trully written. Can only be discovered and experienced. Language is a translation . Truth is impossible to be put in boxes or in words and not be dilluted . Words can be missunderstood but to guide someone to reach truth is something unique .Needs time , effort , chalenges .It is very difficult to do this with a book . Also Truth is not bidimensional but at least tridimensional .Truth is not linear so as to say it from one beginning towards an end . You can teach a truth with thousands of different ways , non of them is better or worse. Read a book doesnt make you wise. Study these thousand possible ways does. ",
