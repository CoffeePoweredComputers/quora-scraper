            "answer_text": "It depends on how much time you\u2019re willing to put into it. It can take as little as a few months to be able to carry a tune, to as many as 3 years or more in order to learn the finer points of singing like harmonizing with other singers or the ability to make your voice vibrate (vibrato). The good news is you carry your voice with you at all times, and because of this you can practice practically any time you wish, either alone or with other singers/musicians. I believe, unless there\u2019s something physically wrong with the components of your singing voice (lungs, vocal cords, nasal passage, hearing, etc.), anyone has the ability to become a singer. It\u2019s a matter of developing the skill, like any other skill. ",

            "answer_text": "I did not sing (at all) until the age of 56. I am at home a lot and sing most every day, and for long stretches and at 58 I pass well enough and post songs that people appear to like.I reckon another year and I will have greater ease.Sing because you are drawn to it, and wish to do it. If it ever feels like pure work, it is not for you at that moment.Personally, I believe that just about everyone can develop their singing voice. There will always be those who like to hear it. If you choose to take a singing instructor, be sure to choose one who caters to the kind of music you like. I do think that is very important! ",
