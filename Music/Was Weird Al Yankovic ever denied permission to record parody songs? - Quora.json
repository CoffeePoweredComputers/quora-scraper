            "answer_text": "Yes. I\u2019m guessing there are probably more than he\u2019s talked about publicly, especially from his early days when he wasn\u2019t a music superstar in his own right, but here are some known examples of artists denying him permission to parody their songs: Prince consistently refused to allow Al to make any parodies of his work. Al would try again from time to time, just in case he\u2019d lightened up and would be more receptive than he had been before. But it never happened, and Prince went to his grave having never approved any Weird Al parody idea. Michael Jackson, on the other hand, was a fan of Weird Al, and had already approved two parodies in the 1980s: \u201cEat It\u201d, as a parody of \u201cBeat It\u201d, and \u201cFat\u201d, as a parody of \u201cBad\u201d. But in the early \u201890s, Al was putting together a new album, and was hoping to use a parody of Jackson\u2019s \u201cBlack or White\u201d, called \u201cSnack All Night\u201d, as the big lead single. But Jackson turned this one down. He told Al he could use any other song from the Dangerous album he wanted, but \u201cBlack or White\u201d just had too serious a message to be made light of. But since \u201cBlack or White\u201d was the monster hit and major cultural event at the time, Al wasn\u2019t interested in settling for a lesser-known album track. He abandoned the idea of using a Michael Jackson song and decided to hang back and watch the charts to see what else might come along. This turned out to be a very fortuitous thing, because shortly thereafter, Nirvana\u2019s \u201cSmells Like Teen Spirit\u201d happened and absolutely blew up. Kurt Cobain gave his blessing for Al to turn it into \u201cSmells Like Nirvana\u201d, noting that being asked for parody permission by \u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic himself was the first time he really realized his \u201clittle group\u201d had made it. So Al had his lead single for the album that would come to be called Off the Deep End, and instead of drawing from that well of the soon-to-be-irrelevant Michael Jackson for a third time, he ended up looking like a real visionary by pouncing on the exploding grunge movement right at its very first hit. Paul McCartney refused his permission for a parody of \u201cLive and Let Die\u201d called \u201cChicken Pot Pie\u201d. Why? Because he\u2019d gone vegan at that point, and he didn\u2019t want his work used to \u201cpromote\u201d the eating of meat. While I admire Sir Paul\u2019s willingness to stand up for his principles, if I could insert my own opinion for a moment, I think he was being unreasonable here. \u201cChicken Pot Pie\u201d is a silly comedy song. I don\u2019t think it was going to inspire anyone to eat chicken who would not otherwise have been willing to eat chicken. But I didn\u2019t write \u201cHey Jude\u201d, so what do I know? Then there are a couple of more ambiguous cases: Coolio denied that he had given Al permission to parody \u201cGangsta\u2019s Paradise\u201d as \u201cAmish Paradise\u201d. Al had spoken with Coolio\u2019s management, never having reached the man himself, and was told that he had approved it. Once the song came out, Coolio claimed that he had never approved it and was very unhappy that Al had made a mockery of his serious message song. It\u2019s not entirely clear what happened. Was there a miscommunication between Coolio and his management? Did Coolio give his approval but then decide that letting Weird Al do a silly reworking of his song was not in keeping with his tough gangsta image, and claimed publicly that he was upset about it even though privately it didn\u2019t actually bother him? No one knows. At any rate, Coolio never sought legal action, and any hard feelings seem to have passed by now. So whatever actually happened, it doesn\u2019t really matter anymore. The situation with Lady Gaga was an odd one. Al had wanted to do a parody of her song \u201cBorn This Way\u201d, called \u201cPerform This Way\u201d, about how over the top her public persona is. When Al spoke to her management, they told him that she was uncertain how she felt about it, and she would need to see the lyrics first. Al obliged and sent them over, but then they told him that she couldn\u2019t really be sure until she heard the song. So Al had to cut short his family vacation, gather his band members together, and actually cut a recording of the song. He sent it over and was then told . . . no, she didn\u2019t like it, and she wouldn\u2019t approve it. This pushed the usually easygoing Al too far; her team had put him and his band through quite a lot of unnecessary inconvenience just to have permission denied, and he decided that if he had to go to all that trouble to put in the work to record it, his fans should at least get to hear it. It wouldn\u2019t go on the album and be sold for profit, because Gaga hadn\u2019t approved it, but his policy of getting permission for his parodies is a personal decision, not a legal obligation. So he put the song up on his YouTube channel for people to listen to for free, and wrote a blog post explaining to his fans why it wasn\u2019t going to be on the upcoming album. Later that same day, Al was contacted by Gaga directly. She said that she had been completely unaware that any of this had been going on, that she was actually a fan of his, that she thought his parody was really funny, and that she gave her full blessing for him to put it on the album. So, it was released on the Alpocalypse album, where he could be paid for his efforts after all. Again, who knows what really happened here? Did her management really go behind her back and make him jump through these hoops without bothering to inform her that he had called? Did she deny permission and then, seeing the backlash once the song and Al\u2019s story came out, decide she had made an error and retract the denial to save face? I wouldn\u2019t even speculate, but again, everything is okay now, so it doesn\u2019t really matter. And a couple of honorable mentions: In 1980, with The Empire Strikes Back being a major hit, Al recorded a demo parody of the song \u201cLola\u201d by The Kinks, called \u201cYoda\u201d. This demo was very successful on \u201cThe Dr. Demento Show\u201d, a popular radio show for comedy music which was instrumental in Al\u2019s initial success. Seeing how popular it had gotten, Al decided to ask George Lucas and the Kinks for permission to release the song on an official album. Lucas approved it, but the Kinks did not. Years later, Al happened to run into Ray Davies, the singer for the Kinks and the man who wrote \u201cLola\u201d in the first place. Al asked Davies why he had denied the parody, and Davies told him this was the first he was even hearing of it. As with the Gaga case, Davies\u2019s people had apparently not even bothered to ask him before turning Al down. Davies did give his permission, and the song was finally released commercially on the album Dare to Be Stupid in 1985. Star Wars being what it is, the song\u2019s coming out five years after the movie it was about did nothing to affect its relevance, and to this day it is one of Al\u2019s most popular songs. James Blunt approved Al\u2019s parody of \u201cYou\u2019re Beautiful\u201d, called \u201cYou\u2019re Pitiful\u201d. So Al recorded it and prepared to release it on his Straight Outta Lynwood album. But at the last minute, not Blunt himself, but Blunt\u2019s record label, Atlantic Records, told him it was not acceptable. Al decided it wasn\u2019t worth a legal battle, even one he would probably win, so he complied and never released the song commercially. But he also decided that since Blunt himself didn\u2019t have a problem with it, there was no harm in releasing it as a free digital download on his own website (this was before YouTube). So he did, and as far as I know, James Blunt has never had anything bad to say about that. Atlantic, however, still will not budge on letting him release it commercially, so it remains unavailable on any compilation album for the foreseeable future. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it\u2019s happened a few times. Prince never said yes. Michael Jackson, an early booster of \u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic, asked him not to parody \u201cBlack Or White\u201d (with \u201cSnack All Night\u201d) because he thought the song\u2019s message was too important. Paul McCartney asked him not to record \u201cChicken Pot Pie\u201d because he didn\u2019t want to endorse meat-eating. Al once thought he had Coolio\u2019s blessing for \u201cAmish Paradise,\u201d his label having contacted Coolio\u2019s, but Coolio actually told his label he did not approve. That\u2019s why Al tries to reach artists personally. There have been also weird incidents like Eminem ruling out a single and video for \u201cCouch Potato\u201d and Atlantic Records lawyering up after Al got James Blunt\u2019s approval to do \u201cYou\u2019re Pitiful.\u201d But as noted in another answer, he doesn\u2019t legally have to ask anyone about any of these songs. And he\u2019ll sometimes play the rejects live or release them some other way. ",
