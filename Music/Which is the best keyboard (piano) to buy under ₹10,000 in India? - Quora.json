            "answer_text": "There is very little point in buying a <10,000 piano. See, after a while you\u2019ll need a better instrument because your skills would keep developing and a cheap model just won\u2019t do. I recommend Casio CTK-6300IN. While some people prefer Yamaha over Casio, Casio is what I have used and I can testify that it\u2019s a very decent instrument for both beginners and intermediate players. The best course of action is going to a music store and getting one which feels right playing. However, if you\u2019re really serious about playing the piano, wait till you can triple your current budget and go for an 88-key, weighted key model, as that\u2019s similar to a real grand piano. ",
