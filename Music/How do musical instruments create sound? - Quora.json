            "answer_text": "Different types of instruments produce sounds in different ways. All of them cause air pressure waves \u2014 because that is what sound is: waves of air pressure differences. String instruments: the strings are made to vibrate, by plucking, hitting or bowing them. The vibrating strings then cause disturbances in the air around them. Most will have a sound chamber that amplifies sound waves of particular groups of frequencies.Electric string instruments: the strings are made of metal, and the body of the guitar contains \u201cpickups\u201d, essentially magnets within coils. As the string vibrates closer and further from the pickup, the pickups generate electricity. That signal is then sent to the amplifier, which makes it more powerful, so that a speaker or headphones will be loud enough to hear.Woodwinds: For reeded woodwinds: the air flow over the reeds will make them vibrate. For non-reeded woodwinds: there is an edge (the \u201cfipple\u201d) that you blow across, either the far edge of the mouth hole (for transverse flute or fife) or an edge you blow towards through the mouth hole (for pipe organ, recorder and tin whistle). This generates turbulance: chaotic air movement. The length of the body of the instrument, up to the first open hole, reinforces particular wavelengths in that chaos, making them stand out a lot more.Brass: the lips vibrate (like when you make a fake \u201cfart\u201d sound by blowing air through closed lips) and the air within the instrument resonates with that vibration.Percussion: you hit something, and that makes air around the instrument move. With a drum, you have a big piece of flexible material, traditionally something like goat skin, that vibrates nicely, making drums nice and loud.Other instruments can work in different ways, but all of them have in common that they make air vibrate. Some of them only do that in their speakers (for electronic instruments), but without vibrating air, there is no sound. ",

            "answer_text": "There are three things needed for an instrument to be heard: First, something that can vibrate, which could be a string, an air column (brasses and woodwinds), a membrane (drumhead, kazoo membrane, etc.), the body of the instrument itself (cymbals, marimbas, maracas), the human body or just a loudspeaker (synthesizer, theremin). Second, Something to disturb or add energy to that vibrating medium. For a string this could be a pick or a bow; for an air-column instrument (aerophone) it\u2019s typically a blown reed of some kind or a player\u2019s lips buzzing in a mouthpiece. Membranes are typically struck with hands, beaters, mallets or sticks. Self-vibrating instruments (idiophones) are similarly struck or shaken. Once disturbed, the vibrating part of the instrument exhibits resonance, which is the tendency to build energy and vibrate at a particular frequency or frequency spectrum. For example a bass guitar has a concentration of energy at its fundamental frequency (the note you hear), whereas say, a cello still has a strongly recognizable fundamental, but also produces a complex spectrum of overtones which give it that very rich tone (timbre). A cymbal resonates in many different frequencies or modes - so many that it produces a shimmering sound rather than a distinct note. Thirdly and most important, an instrument needs a way of efficiently coupling the vibrating energy to the surrounding air. For example, if you pluck a string by itself, you may hear a faint note, but because a string is very skinny and round, it really doesn\u2019t make much impression on the air. Consider the same string in a grand piano - a note easily loud enough to fill a concert hall. The difference is that the piano string is stretched on a bridge connected to a large spruce soundboard. The string mechanically transfers its energy efficiently to the soundboard and the soundboard couples to the air over a large area, maximizing the acoustic energy that can reach your ear. For winds and brasses, this coupling is accomplished by the bell at the end of the instrument; for drums, it\u2019s the body of the drum itself. These three things work \u201cin concert\u201d to produce a vast variety of musical sounds. ",
