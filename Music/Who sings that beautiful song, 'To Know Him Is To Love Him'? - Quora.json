            "answer_text": "Written by Phil Spector, based on the inscription on his father\u2019s tombstone, \u201cTo know him was to love him,\u201d it was performed by the Teddy Bears, the vocal group to which he was a member, in 1958. It enjoyed some degree of success. It was also recorded by Peter & Gordon, Bobby Vinton, the Shirelles, and even the Beatles had a version. My personal favourite is by Steeleye Span. They had David Bowie as a guest playing saxophone. This was recorded around 1978 and included on their live album as an add on at the end, not part of the live performance, but a studio recording. ",

            "answer_text": "The Teddy Bears sang it, and then there has been a lot of renditions of it. Just like I will always love you that Dolly Parton put out that Whutney Houston did a rendition. Come together that John Lennon and the Beatles put out and when MJ purchased the Beatles Sony catalog. I am surprised he did not put out more songs than that one ; since he had that catalog. ",
