            "answer_text": "It depends on what you count and what you don\u2019t. If you count polkas, there are only two musicians that could possibly be considered. Weird Al has a whole polka dedicated to The Rolling Stones that includes twelve of their songs. Another polka contains a thirteenth Rolling Stones song, and yet another polka contains the song State of Shock by Mick Jagger and the Jacksons. More recently, we have the Hamilton Polka, referencing fourteen songs by the same composer plus a reprise. Depending on whether or not you count the reprise as a separate song, the answer to your question would be Lin-Manuel Miranda, possibly tied with Mick Jagger\u2026 if you count polkas. The only other musicians who would even come close would be other veteran members of the Rolling Stones like Keith Richards and Charlie Watts. Another candidate is Michael Jackson. Even casual Weird Al fans have heard of Fat and Eat it, and State of Shock has already been mentioned. Weird Al wrote another parody called Snack All Night, based on Michael Jackson\u2019s Black or White, but he never released it on an album out of respect for the message of the original song. Although he never wrote a parody of Thriller or included it in a polka, he did do a sort of visual parody of it in the music video for Eat It. Depending on whether or not you count polkas, music videos, or songs not on studio albums, the number of Michael Jackson songs Weird Al has parodied ranges from two to five. If you count music videos and songs separately, the number jumps up by an additional two for Fat and Eat It. You\u2019ve also got Paul McCartney and George Harrison. The only song of the Beatles that Weird Al pays homage to on a studio album is Hey Jude as part of a polka (the same one that has the Rolling Stones song, if you\u2019re curious). However, he\u2019s also written parodies of two other Beatles songs that didn\u2019t make it to studio albums: Gee I\u2019m a Nerd (Free as a Bird) and Pacman (Taxman). The album Even Worse includes (This Song\u2019s Just) Six Words Long, which is a parody of George Harrison\u2019s Got My Mind Set on You, and there\u2019s a song called Chicken Pot Pie floating around the internet, which is a parody of Live and Let Die by Paul McCartney and the Wings. This song might have made it onto a studio album if Weird Al hadn\u2019t been so good about respecting the original artists\u2019 wishes and Paul McCartney hadn\u2019t been such a self-important vegetarian. The music video for UHF also references Your Mother Should Know, a song they performed as part of their Magical Mystery Tour movie. This gives Paul McCartney anywhere from zero to five parody references, and George Harrison gets one to five. I don\u2019t think there are any other musicians out there you can make a true case for, but here are some other fun tidbits: Weird Al parodied Bob Dylan\u2019s Subterranean Homesick Blues music video in the music video he made for UHF, and then again fourteen years later in the music video he made for Bob. To my knowledge, this is the only time he has parodied the same music video for two separate songs.Eminem and Lady Gaga both have the honor to have been parodied by Weird Al in two separate tracks on the same album. Poodle Hat has a song called Couch Potato, which is a spoof on Eminem\u2019s Lose Yourself, and it also includes The Real Slim Shady at the end of The Angry White Boy Polka. Alpocalypse showcases Lady Gaga\u2019s flamboyant stage presence with the song Perform This Way as a parody of Born This Way, and you don\u2019t have to be a genius to know which Lady Gaga song starts off the medley on the same album entitled Polka Face.",

            "answer_text": "Weird Al has parodied many musicans in his career. I would have to say Michael Jackson. He is the only one I could find more than one song he did a parody of. Eat it was a parody of beat it. Even the whole video was a frame by frame parody. He also did fat which was a parody of bad. Likewise, the video was a parody of it too. I know after fat, he didn\u2019t really want to do Michael Jackson parodies anymore. I can\u2019t find anyone else he did more than one song of. ",
