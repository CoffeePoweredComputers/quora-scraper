            "answer_text": "Since, I talk about k-pop so much, I think I\u2019ll talk a bit more about j-pop this time. Just like K-pop there are many dark things that we as fans either overlook or don\u2019t know about, or either it is something out of our power. Sasaengs/ Extremely Obsessed fans.One thing that is common between the Kpop and Jpop industry is that, there is always some obsessed fans that really take it too an extreme extent. The reason why I think that this is very dark, is because even if these Sasaengs (extremist fans that are involved in kpop), and obsessive fans are literally stalking, harassing, and getting into personal spaces, there is RARELY anything done idols can complain that this is a serious problem, but as I said nothing is actually done to these fans, to hold them accountable for their actions until someone literally gets hurt.Take the case of Mayu Tomita. [1]She was a member of AKB48 and an actress and singer. On May 21,2016,Mayu got stabbed 37 times [2]all over her body by an obsessive fan. Mayu is still alive miraculously, and the fan now serves 14.5 years of prison. However, she had been reporting that this man had been stalking her, sending her death threats for literally just returning a gift to him. That woman is now partially blind in her left eye, and most likely experiencing trauma from the incident. What makes this upsetting is that no one took her seriously until it was too late. For kpop fans, even though sasaengs haven\u2019t done anything to this extent, this doesn\u2019t shy away to the fact that nothing is done when idols express to their fans to stop getting into their personal spaces and following them, and harassing them. This case is sad to see, because it shows the reality of what these idols face with probably on a daily basis. Yes, these obsessive fans need some mental help, but they also need to be punished for the emotional stress they give their idols.Dating BansAnother common thing with the kpop and jpop industry, is that many companies ban their idols from dating to a certain extent. Where after so many years, or until the graduate from their group will they have the ability to date again. The main reason why these companies have dating bans, is precisely due to fans. This sounds quite absurd, but it is mostly true. Lots of fans will tend to freak out if their idol gets into a relationship, and this is really because of how they feel that their idol solely exists for the fans and nothing else. To me, idols that sign into companies with dating bans, are almost like signing up to marry all of your million fans.Often times, if idols get into a relationship there is quite a lot of backlash but there are still fans who don\u2019t care if their idols get into a relationship. Some of this backlash can get out of hand, where the idol is punished in a way where it just doesn\u2019t even make any logical sense, if you look at this in a normal perspective for fans who think normally.I\u2019ve mentioned this before in this question Kila Mel's answer to What have been the biggest J-pop scandals?. But the situation of what happened to Minami Minegishi, where she shaved her head due to the dating ban in her company, because she ended up in a scandal with Alan Shirahama, is just ridiculously sad, and ridiculous.There is also Sungmin from the kpop group Super Junior, where his fans petitioned him out of any future group promotions, because his fans felt \u201cbetrayed\u201d for him getting married. Now the talk of him getting petitioned out of the group completely is surfacing[3], but hopefully nothing is done for it where he needs to leave the group.As well as the incident where kpop idols HyunA and Edawn (formally a member of Pentagon), got kicked out of their company for dating each other because they violated the contract. [4]Keeping the YouthThis is more common with jpop idol groups, specifically girl groups. If you have listened to any jpop girl groups, you will notice that the girls are pretty young ranging from ages 13\u201323 mostly. Nothing is wrong with this, since most idols debut at a young age, the only thing is is that, you almost rarely see a jpop girl group idol (not solo) that is not even above the age of 25.Zetima and Hachama which is a subsidiary of Epic Records and Pony Canyon in Japan, has/had famous girl groups, like Morning Musume, Cute, Camellia Factory, Angerme, Juice=juice have a tradition of holding graduating concerts for any of it members, and welcoming the new younger members in. A lot of it, is to keep the name of the group from continuing but, also the girls who graduate are usually the oldest members (who actually aren\u2019t even that old, probably around ages 18\u201324), which is to keep the group at a certain age range. A lot of it I feel, that it is a sense of ageism among companies to keep girl groups young, but also to satisfy fans to keep the youth since, the younger you are the most energy you can bring out on stage. Since, lots of their fans have a huge range of being really young to really old. Its interesting, but I see it as there are some fans who I feel have pedophilia, since these girls are also so young. Not that having older fans are bad, its a good thing you can make music that can reach them, but it just increases the thought of pedophilia. However, the girls who do graduate do move on with their career and their life where they start as a solo artist or even get married which is always fun to see.Drugs/ Sex for money/ prostitution/and many related eventsNow the biggest kpop case, South Korea has probably has ever seen was Burning Sun[5] where so many idols we used to know and love have been involved and arrested by contributing into a prostitution ring. Not to mention drugs and consent were involved. There are probably questions on Quora regarding this case, as it is not even over yet. So I won\u2019t get into detail here. I will just give you an article that talks about the timeline of events.To me this isn\u2019t quite surprising, since there are many entertainment industries that have had issues regarding these topics. If its America, one additional topic would be artists murdering others, which hasn\u2019t been seen in any artists or idols in both kpop and jpop. But it just goes to show that these idols aren\u2019t as innocent as it seems or what the media portrays them as. At least it has made people more aware of situations like these, and the possibility of these events happening. But it is dark and heavy subject in both the kpop and jpop communities.Mental HealthTo me, for both kpop and jpop, mental health such as depression, anxiety, and stress isn\u2019t taken so seriously as it should, since both countries have very high suicide rates. In the music industry for both, it is partially the companies fault, but the majority goes to the society these artists live in.For both communities, mental health is almost a taboo subject to really touch on, but it needs to be talked about. On October 14, 2019 the kpop world has lost a well loved idol , Sulli, or as known as Choi Jin-ri. Where many fans speculate that she had taken her life, from all the cyber bullying she has put up with from the time she left the kpop group f(x) until now that she is gone. Where, if you had follow up with all the events and articles prior to Sulli\u2019s death, a lot of it deals with cyber bullying. What makes this dark, is that it took a whole life of one, to see the truth of the internet and open a lot of fans eyes up, that what people were doing to her wasn\u2019t okay. Where now South Korea is now considering creating a Sulli Act, in place for cyber bullies to be put out there and known, as well punished.Not to mention Jonghyun, who was in SHINee, who is also from the same company as Sulli, took his own life back in December 18, 2017. Same with him, it took the life of an idol to see that, idols are experiencing mental health issues that shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly.For J-pop there was X-Japan\u2019s Hide, who also took his life back in May 2, 1998. I am not sure what happened with society over in Japan with Hide passed away (I was born literally a couple of days after he passed away). But as big of an artist he was, Japan is facing so many issues with suicide, where it also affects Japanese artists too.Overall, there are bad things in both kpop and jpop that probably should be known before entering the world of either genre (if you are new). But there is plenty of good things in each genres that are enjoyable, despite these dark subjects. (Sorry if this answer has some typos, bad grammar, run on sentences, etc. I was writing this before the start of my next class, forgive me for trying to pass on time).
