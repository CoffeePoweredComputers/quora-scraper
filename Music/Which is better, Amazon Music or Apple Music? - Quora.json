            "answer_text": "Apple Music has an edge over the competition for one big reason: exclusive releases. It was the only place to stream Adele, Drake, Chance The Rapper and Frank Ocean's newest albums upon release and it remains the only service that streams Taylor Swift's \"1989\" record. The service also offers a ton of playlists, many hand-crafted by musicians and tastemakers, however it lacks the robust sharing options built into Spotify. Pros It combines your iTunes library with music you don't own, rounding out what you can play.A combination of human music experts and algorithms help find music you'll want to hear based on what you play.You can control what you hear or search for new music using Siri on iOS devices.Has music locker via iTunes MatchCons Despite being overhauled in iOS 10, the app's design remains confusing, making it frustrating to useAndroid app not compatible with all devicesDoesn't work with old iPods (except iPod Touch)Who will choose it Those who want to listen to albums and songs they've added to iTunes. Anyone who wants to listen to the newest, hottest music from the world's biggest musicians. Amazon Music Unlimited is the newest kid on the block. It looks to follow in Tidal and Apple Music's footsteps, signing an exclusive contract to release Garth Brooks's latest record. Brooks doesn't have the same hip factor as Drake or Beyonce, but neither does Amazon Music Unlimited. Rather than having a big focus on helping subscribers stay on the cutting-edge of music, the service features recommended playlists and radio stations that are grouped around artists you've already listened to. Pros Cheapest per month -- if an Amazon Prime memberLyrics automatically pop up on the \"now playing\" screenOffers cheaper plans for Amazon Echo, Echo Dot and Amazon Tap (but restricts listening to those devices).Has music locker, and allows you to \"mix and match\" music in locker, streaming catalog and Prime Music catalog into one playlistCons Artist profiles don't have biographiesOfficially advertised as \"tens of millions\" of tracks strong, it's unclear if the catalog is quite as large as its competitors listed here (see chart)Who will choose it Amazon Prime members who want to save a few bucks, and mix their existing music collection with a subscription content.

            "answer_text": "It really depends on your taste in music If you are more into international music and are the among the first ones to listen to album when a new album drops then hands down Apple Music is best since some of exclusive albums come out on Apple music. Relatively speaking. It would make more sense to use Apple music of you are an iOS user since everything is well integrated with Siri. Since Siri commands work only on Apple music and none other streaming services. Apple music is relatively expensive. On the other hand Amazon music is what receives new music a little later expect 1\u20132 hours on new rap albums and none of exclusive albums. Mind you I\u2019m talking here about international music. Interface maybe a con to some but that depends on personal preference. It is also quite cheap considering you also get access to Amazon\u2019s Prime TV Shows some of which are exclusive to Amazon Prime only. Also since Amazon music is expanding it has started to get some exclusive releases and new releases faster than Apple music. But you know typical Apple. In India pricing for Apple music is Rs.60 month or $1/month (for students) and Rs.120 or $2/month (for individual)For one year it is Rs.720 or $12 But check out amazon\u2019s pricing Rs.500 or $8.33 for one year with prime membership and benefits such as one-day delivery form amazon marketplace, prime video and of course amazon music. But these prices vary from country to country. But here in India Amazon music is hands down the best. ",
