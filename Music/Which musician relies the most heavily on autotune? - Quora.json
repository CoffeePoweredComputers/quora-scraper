By now, I think we can all agree that technology has taken the front seat in driving most of contemporary music\u2019s major innovations, whether in pop, jazz, hip-hop, or modern instrumental. You could point just as easily to the Edge turning his guitar into an organ with effects pedals as you can to Skrillex making a (pretty darn good) living without ever learning to play an actual instrument. But there will always be one instrument that people will have a hard time accepting technology\u2019s ability to augment or alter: vocals. Perhaps it was that awful pre-chorus in Cher\u2018s 1998 hit \u201cBelieve\u201d that sullied it, but as soon as an artist corrects his or her pitch using Auto-Tune and his or her voice starts to digitally wander, critics immediately point to it as evidence of a lack of vocal talent. And, for sure, untalented pop artists do tend to hide behind this life-saving software, but is it always used for that purpose? Are artists really incapable of using Auto-Tune stylistically, even when they\u2019ve got the chops to back it up? T-Pain\u2018s heartfelt, stripped-down performance on NPR\u2019s Tiny Desk Concerts series in 2014 proves, triumphantly, otherwise. I would challenge critics to evaluate why vocals need to remain so pure and unaffected, especially when there\u2019s a long-accepted history of guitarists, synthesists, drummers, etc. who drown their instruments in effects? Hint: They don\u2019t. If Dr. Dre had made all of his classic beats on an acoustic drum kit, the world would be a different place. Then again, if he hadn\u2019t programmed them digitally, someone else would have. Auto-Tune can certainly sound tacky and unpleasant at times, and, in some situations, it\u2019s utterly superfluous. Yet, like anything, when it\u2019s used with subtlety and ingenuity, it can imbue a track with a compelling, unique, and undefinable sound. Here are a few examples of artists tastefully using Auto-Tune and why it works. 1. Frank Ocean \u2013 \u201cChanel\u201d The majority of this song features Ocean\u2019s voice au naturel with just a little bit of reverb. After a powerful vocal run where he reaches for the some of the highest notes in his chest voice, Ocean finally settles into an Auto-Tuned hook at 2:11 with the lyric, \u201cI see both sides like Chanel.\u201d There\u2019s no question that he could have sung that small bit without Auto-Tune, but it adds a robotic, almost melismatic, effect to his voice. The way his voice oscillates between notes with Auto-Tune is subtle and inhuman, and he only includes it in this one small part of the song. It\u2019s creative and minimal, and no matter why he chose to expose the effect in that moment, nobody could argue this wasn\u2019t a deliberate artistic decision. 2. Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 \u201c711\u201d If you don\u2019t think Beyonc\u00e9 can sing, watch this. She\u2019s provided powerful vocal performances to her fans for years and years. No one has to wonder whether or not Beyonc\u00e9 has a gorgeous, dynamic voice, yet, on occasion, when the song calls for it, she leans on Auto-Tune to create a more electronic feel. On \u201c711,\u201d the Houston singer raps her way through the banger, and she uses a small dose of Auto-Tune to give her vocals that extra trappy effect to match the rapid flutter of the drum machine\u2018s snare hits. In this way, the effect provides a way in for her vocals to fit the song\u2019s electronic, simulated context so they can shine within it. 3. Chance The Rapper \u2013 \u201cSmoke Break\u201d (feat. Future) Chance The Rapper is an incredibly gifted rapper and vocalist. His smoky timbre and powerful voice yield soulful, honest performances whether he\u2019s rapping or singing. Just watch him perform live. Prior to breaking his third mixtape, Coloring Book, Chance had never tried Auto-Tune, despite some of his peers using it religiously. When the mixtape finally dropped, fans were surprised to hear the contentious effect. But what Chance did was smart; rather than depending on it in order to hit the right notes, he uses it for stylistic purposes, like on the song above, \u201cSmoke Break,\u201d with Future. It elevates his sound to fit in more with the Top 40 radio pop mold, which could\u2019ve been a strategic move to gain more national airplay. And because it\u2019s one of only a few instances on the album that he uses it, the effect doesn\u2019t tire us out. 4. James Blake \u2013 \u201cPut That Away and Talk to Me\u201d James Blake is famous for his falsetto crooning. His cover of Feist\u2019s \u201cLimit to Your Love\u201d features his voice front and center with nothing but a little bit of reverb and compression affecting it. Blake is no stranger to affecting his voice, and, on his last album, he embraced Auto-Tune on \u201cPut That Away and Talk to Me,\u201d above. The way he uses the effect makes his voice sound tiny, small, and robotic. But his emotions are still there in full color \u2014 they\u2019re just under the spell of electronic manipulation. He\u2019s a heartbroken cyborg. 5. Kanye West \u2013 \u201cRunaway\u201d Everyone knows Kanye West put out an entire album full of Auto-Tuned songs \u2014 the polarizing and essential hip-hop release 808s & Heartbreak. The song we\u2019re going to focus on, however, isn\u2019t from that album. In fact, it\u2019s a song where he doesn\u2019t even rap or sing with Auto-Tune (that you can clearly hear) at all. At the 6:05 mark, it sounds as if a distorted guitar begins to rip a very low-tuned solo. That isn\u2019t a guitar, though. It\u2019s not a synthesizer either. It\u2019s West\u2019s voice. He puts an ocean of distortion on his vocal track, then turns the Auto-Tune up to 11, and basically creates his own guitar solo but with his voice. It\u2019s an innovative way to craft a solo, and while, to some, it might sound like distorted mumbling, others may passively hear it as a long guitar solo. Auto-Tune doesn\u2019t just have to be a mask that bad singers wear \u2014 it also can be a tool for unique creative expression in addition to crafting interesting production. ",
