            "answer_text": "Going anonymous because my friends know me here and don\u2019t know I read fanfics. Now, the previous answers also have great stories, and I\u2019ll try my best to omit stories that have already been mentioned. For me, what defines a great, or the best story is the quality of writing, the plot, and how much it balances certain elements. So far, I\u2019ve discovered a lot but not too many\u2014 Here is my top twelve, and I\u2019ll indicate rating, length, and how wonderful these fics are (in no particular order): Note: Not gonna give a 10/10 rating or anything like that because they\u2019re all 10+ for me House of Cards by sugamins- (actually, include everything written by sugamins, bar none.)- rated E(xplicit), has a lot of violence, gore, and explicit scenes- the very first, and arguably the very best fanfiction\u2014 no, story I\u2019ve read (in line with the last story in this post) Speaks a lot about the fuckery of this world.- pretty long; it\u2019ll take you a few hours to finish this (I stayed up late just to continue reading this)Vervain and Rapunzel by vietbluefic- rated T, has violence, and major character death as well- think Rapunzel and Hansel and Gretel mixed together, all while maintaining its own individuality as a story- read so much like an actual Grimm Fairy Tale- dark, disturbing, and highly recommended- only a couple of chapters long, but beat a lot of long fics I know based on its content and its qualityThe Bulletproof Host Club by naxariis- the first lighthearted one so far on this list- rated T, no warnings unless you count sudden serious moments among silly ones- hijinks and shenanigans. That is all.- perfect blend of humor, sass, and cute/tragic backstories- still going strong, so far is above ten chaptersyou say witch like it\u2019s a bad thingby Curionene- another wonderful author, check out all their works pls- Rated E for explicit content and some violence- Witch!Seokjin with Familiar!Yoongi- Humor, romance, angst, fantasy, and werewolves, oh my!- one of my favorites, always gave me a smile when it updated\u2014 it\u2019s over 20 chapters long- make sure to read its companion fic, as wellwhat am I supposed to say (when I\u2019m all choked up and you\u2019re okay?) by wenmemehuiSuperpowers! Prophecies! Humor! Angst! Hoorah!Well-balanced characters, great worldbuilding and principles of magic, and the connection of everything to everything is amazingAuthor updates slowly tho, makes up for it in the quality of chaptersCatchy blurb\u2014went for the superpowers, stayed for that and everything elseStarving (& Other Artistic Mediums) by TAHC- rated M for mild smut- struggling artists NamGi + Baby Jungkook- multilayered story, with many untold stories WITHIN itself, and the writer\u2019s style could make you feel every single emotion known to mankind.- two or three chapters- don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s humor hereLiar Liar by suga_wa- still cracks me up until now, even with the multiple times I\u2019ve read it cover to cover- a case of mistaken identity, that I totally relate to since it reminded me of when I first joined the fandom- Rated M for one explicit scene- five chapters, but humor is off the chartsEat Your Heart Out by CynoDemure- rated T, potentially triggering content (eating disorders); one or two chapters- hits you really close to the heart- deals with feelings of loneliness and finding comfort in someoneYou\u2019ve Got The Best Of Me by internetpistol- death. loss. life. love. happiness.- I don\u2019t want to leave any comment about this story, as no words could legitimately describe it. This story gave me goosebumps, and had me let out tears. In all my years of reading stories, not one has managed to make me cry and borderline break down like this story did.- I knew after reading the title that this was going to be great. - my expectations were exceeded. Severely.- It just\u2026 it felt like I was in the story. You know how it\u2019ll end, but it still hurts when you see it.Rainbaby by signifying_nothing- FUCK THAT, everything by signis, but this is a favorite of mine because of the worldbuilding, the human dilemma, and the fact that this is one of signis\u2019s best works- finally found an accurate story that describes a son\u2019s love for a mother and vice-versa- found and lost family- went for the Fae blurb, stayed for the familial + romantic themesunmaking by maledict- the blurb tells you how it\u2019ll end- put this in the list because it\u2019s still the only fic less than 2,000 words that managed to create a large impact to me- Hunger Games AU- mentions of underage prostitution, but that\u2019s it for the M ratingArcanum by InterludRealityDark. Dark. Dark as fuck.Rated E because violence and non con content is REALAside from sugamins\u2019s Ophelia, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve read anything this dark beforeHere\u2019s the thing: Deals with the devil don\u2019t end up well, kidsA story about trying to break free from a tyrant, and the humanity one has to sacrifice to gain their own freedomSounds weird, but it kinda fitsNot for the weak of heartPut this in the list because of how wonderfully this was executed, and for the great plot as wellSPECIAL MENTION, LAST, BUT DEFINITELY NOT THE LEAST: Blood Work by SaltyAuntSuga - leave me alone, I\u2019m still drowning in feels - boi I could not stress how astounding this story is.- legit at the same level (or even above) House of Cards, and that\u2019s saying something- character development, morality, plot twists, drama, realism, vAMPIRES, NON-CLICHES, WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR- accurate tag: you will scream \u201cFUCK THIS FIC\u201d- believe me.- if you\u2019re looking for realistic characterization and stories where characters make the wrong decisions, this one\u2019s for you. Also, we got relationships of every kind here: healthy, unhealthy, familial, and romantic.- not to mention the wit and kindness of the author <3 Whoo, so I was meaning for it just to be a top ten, but then I couldn\u2019t leave a few of them out. If you\u2019re really going to ask me what is the best, well\u2026 I really can\u2019t choose because they all have their own charms. If you\u2019re looking for long reads though, Blood Work and House of Cards are for you. Have a good read!! ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I'm a major fanfiction reader and by now I've read mannnnyyyy. But mostly it depends on what type of genre you are looking for and what ship appeals to you more. As I'm an avid reader of fan fictions on archive of our own so I can only give you opinions of the ones I've read on that site\u2026 The Songbird and the sea\u2026 (Yoonmin and side vkook) Literally one of the best fanfiction out there. The plotline is amazing, the writing is amazing everything is JUST FREAKING AMAZING. Its fantasy and its absolutely mind boggling how the writer thought of the plot. Innocent Jimin is offered as a sacrifice to the troop of The Black Fox of The East when they attack their village and Jimin hates his life aboard The Agust. But of course, our sunshine Tae is there to keep him company and things\u2026happen. Pirates BTS?? awesome vmin? enemies to lovers?(hello? the BEST TROUPE OUT THERE!!) Its all out there! Definitely a MUST READ.Fall asleep (fall for you)\u2026 (Taekook and side Yoonmin) The writer just knows how to sweep a person into this one. Insomniac JK who can't sleep in someone's presence due to trauma has to deal with a persistent Taehyung who just start rooming with him. (Enemies to lovers again!!) A flash of angst with absolutely beautiful storyline and character development. I've reread it so many times now.Tastes like victory\u2026.(Jikook with side taegi) Prepare yourself for a tub full of angst coz its right here. Boy oh boy it absolutely drowns you in anguish. (Enemies to lovers AGAIN) An underground boxer JK and a prostitute Jimin who meets under unfavorable circumstances but Jimin needs protection so he asks JK to teach him how to fight. But our cold hearted JK is really an asshole in the beginning but don't let that back you away!! They have the most beautiful relationship in the end!Incalesensce (Taekook) I just read it a few days ago and the writer is planning to write a sequel to it and it definitely is worth all the love it gets coz its brilliant! Fantasy again with the people grouped according to the seasons they are born in. A winter born JK with a spring born Taehyung ( guess what is it) who can't touch each other and cancel each other's power out. Accidentally get roomed together and just CAN'T stand each other! Its really good! Give it a try!Cuz in a sky full of stars ( i think I saw you)\u2026 (Taekook with side namjin and yoonmin) One of the earliest fanfiction I read and it still has a special place in my heart! Who just doesn't want sexy CEO JK with his adorable assistant Tae? Throw fake dating in to appease Seokjin and namjoon (who are getting married) and they fly of to Jeju island but can they fool their hyungs? Its absolutely magnificent piece of art and definitely needs to be read!I know there are many out there which are really amazing and every artist and writer needs to be appreciated and loved but here are just SOME of my favorites! If I started going on, the whole day will be gone and my list won't be finished! ",
