            "answer_text": "We should not feel hurt while singing. Vibrato is a phenomenon that should just be allowed - not produced. The human vocal mechanism (including airways) has an organic tendency to add vibrato to the sung tone. The style of musical has made this into a (somewhat stereotype) effect - only added to the 'tail' of the note - also called 'release'. So it might signal letting go of the 'control' of the tone/emotion. Older singers may have a heavy vibrato - signaling weak support. The natural sounding frequency seems to be around 7 Hz - which is similar to the amount of beats allowed in the corresponding piano range (due to tempered tuning). A fast vibrato gives the impression of nervousness. So you may try to just let go and notice what vibrato is naturally in your voice. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes to Joergen\u2019s answer. I would emphasize that singing should NEVER hurt regardless of vibrato. Vibrato is a naturally occurring phenomenon that results from efficient vocal production: breath combined with vocal tract coordination. If you ever feel discomfort while singing, STOP, swallow a sip of water, then return to practice. If the discomfort continues, it means there is some tension that will cause you continuing trouble. Get an experienced teacher to help with it. ",
