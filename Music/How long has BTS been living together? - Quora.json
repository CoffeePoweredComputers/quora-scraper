They\u2019ll be celebrating 10 years of living together in October of this year(2020)Hoseok isn\u2019t far behind, he\u2019s been living with them for 9 years, Jungkook for 9 years as well, though he came months after Hoseok started living in their first dorm. Jin was the last to move into the dorm, but Tae and Jimin lived there around the same so those 3 have been living with the others for about 8 years. That\u2019s just living together, they\u2019ve known each other for longer than they\u2019ve lived together, for some of them they knew each other for a year or more prior to living together. Hope that helped. ",

Knowing Jungkook signed up to be a ig Hit trainee at 13, I'm gonna guess they've lived together for 9-10 years. I'm not sure about their current living situation, as it seems during this pandemic times they have been away from each other (but it might just be my impression), but I'm sure they are together 90% of the time as they have the same schedule.\ud83e\udd17 ",
