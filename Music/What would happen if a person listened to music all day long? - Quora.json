            "answer_text": "A long time can mean whatever you want it to mean, so I\u2019\u2019ll assume a full-length symphony concert is a \u2018long\u2019 time, as opposed to spinning a half dozen pop records. If the music is to your taste, which hopefully it will be as you\u2019ve chosen to attend the concert, then it is very likely that you will already know or at least know of the works being performed and/or their composers, so you should have a fair idea what you are in for. Given the above, you will find yourself - with luck and a good performance - carried along by the music, delighting in the elements within it you are familiar with or pleasantly surprised and maybe moved by the unexpected. So you should, you could, leave the concert hall uplifted by the wonderful music you have experienced. I use the word \u2018experienced\u2019 because, with much classical music, you don\u2019t just listen to it, you actually experience it - feeling the emotions, the joys, the sorrows, the romance - the composers intended. Again, that\u2019s just my view, honestly stated. You may think differently and you may be right, so please don\u2019t take offence if you disagree. ",

            "answer_text": "You'll start by listening to your favorite tracks, this will go on for an hour or so and you'll listen to each and every song to make the most sense out of it and try to relate to the situation you are presently in. You'll enjoy it fully and the state of euphoria you always desired is almost reached. You get a little bored then and try to shuffle tracks. You keep changing tracks then you reach the end of your playlist and then you feel energetically drained.Then, since you've nothing better to do, you play your favorite song once again. Then you realise that this doesn't make sense or it is boring or it is just that. Then you throw your earphones and promise yourself to never listen to music again. At this point, you are hell saturated and trust me, you'll keep that promise for at least 3 days. ",
