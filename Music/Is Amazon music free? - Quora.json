            "answer_text": "Amazon Music is not free. You need to subscribe to Amazon Prime Music or Amazon Music Unlimited to listen to Amazon Music. And you will cannot listen to the music once it expiry. If you want to download music, you need a program to help you download the music to MP3 or other formats, so that you can still play the music. And I suggest you try to use TunePat Amazon Music Converter as it is no need to install Amazon Music app but download music from Amaozn Music web player. This program supports to download Amazon Music to MP3, AAV, WAV, and FLAC format, and the downloaded music can be played on any other media players. ",
