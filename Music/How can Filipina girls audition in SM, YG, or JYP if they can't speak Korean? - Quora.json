            "answer_text": "You can join the online audition for YG and JYP. Or maybe Global audition like SM did last year (2018) if theres any this year. It doesnt mather that you cant speak korean. If you really pass the online audition or audition i think they will call you face to face, there should be a translator so you can communicate without using korean language. Well i never pass the online audition but i ever got casted by SM and im Indonesian btw. They will not ask you to speak korean, they just ask what language you master and stuff. Plus.. if you really pass and become a trainnee, they will teach you how to speak korean. If you really want to audition, just focus on yout talent. Hope this help ",
