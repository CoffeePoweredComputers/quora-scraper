            "answer_text": " Red Hot Chili Peppers - One Hot Minute It's actually a really good record, but the band has had problems with it already years before it was created. In 1991, the RHCP recorded what is considered their best record, Blood Sugar Sex Magik. It was their big, worldwide breakthrough. Guitarist John Frusciante hated the idea of being this type of rock-band guitarist. He started obstructing the band, quit the band mid-tour in May 1992 and lived a very secluded life for some years. In the meanwhile, the RHCP had big troubles finding a new guitarist. Eventually, they found out Dave Navarro (ex-Jane\u2019s Addiction) was available. They took over a year to compose and record One Hot Minute. Navarro\u2019s way of writing music was very different compared to Frusciante (and the first guitarist, Hillel Slovak). RHCP makes their music spontaneously, jamming and improvising for hours. Navarro was more of a thinker and a writer. Despite the hardships and despite the disappointing sales, One Hot Minute, released in 1995, was a musical success. (In my opinion, RHCP makes some of their best music when they're in trouble or just coming out of trouble.) The match with Navarro, however, turned out to not be so good anymore. He left the band / was put out of the band early 1998, with Frusciante coming back. In the mean time, Frusciante had been going through some really bad years, having suffered from a heroin addiction that he only barely survived (at one of his low points, he almost cut out his eyes because he thought there was a demon inside). The Dutch journalist Bram van Splunteren made a confronting documentary of his horrifying situation in 1994. His friends finally took Frusciante in rehab and he rejoined the band early 1998. And that's when the big OHM-ignoring started. For reasons never explained (perhaps Frusciante refused to play these songs, perhaps the other band members didn't want to confront him with this \u201cother\u201d music, perhaps it was because singer Anthony Kiedis and Navarro had big difficulties with each other) the band never played a One Hot Minute-song, with the exception of Pea, which is a short, absurdistic solo by Flea, the bass guitarist. A lot of fans wanted OHM-songs and the other two band members (Flea and Chad Smith, the drummer) really like(d) the record. But alas, it was never played. Only very recently, with Josh Klinghoffer having replaced Frusciante (who quit around 2009 for the second time), they started playing Aeroplane, one of the OHM-singles. ",

            "answer_text": "Since there are some good answers here I will only add 1. For the longest time the band RUSH. They formed in the early 70\u2019s with 5 guys and a style and a sound but languished in obscurity and then with the approaching 80\u2019s their label dropped them citing they were not material for the new era. Another label became involved (Polygram Records) and sat them down and told them that if they relaunched as a CONSCIOUSNESS MUSIC BAND that label would take them and produce them. At the heart was this statement: \u201cAll of you guys are very smart guys and now it is time to start writing smart music\u201d. REM & U2 beat them to the punch as the guys reluctantly came onboard and 2 guys left entirely in protest making RUSH a 3 man band. In one of the few cases ever the record label was 100% right & the artists were 100% wrong. By 1983 RUSH had relaunched, lost most of it\u2019s 70\u2019s fan base, began connecting to a younger & smarter crowd and went on to produce 7 epic albums in a row. A feat no other band in history has managed. HOWEVER it was well down the line before those guys began to actually embrace and accept what they were writing and performing and maybe not until HOLD YOU FIRE did that happen. Just after that they did a tour called SHOW OF HANDS and in that they had clearly made the transition of not only liking their own music but actually LOVING THEIR OWN MUSIC. This clearly showed and that tour although it changed names was carried over from 88 - 92 = 5 years basically. BUT IT ALL STARTED WITH BEING ASKED TO MAKE A FORM OF MUSIC THEY DID NOT KNOW, LIKE, OR WANT ANY PART OF. Today they may still not be a top all time band by sales, but are among the most respected ARTISTS in rock history. ",
