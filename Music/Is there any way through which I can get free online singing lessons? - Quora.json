            "answer_text": "Oh boy. I\u2019ve been interested in singing for a long time, so as a beginner the first thing I went to were these vocal coaches who gave out free lessons on YouTube explaining how the voice works and methods to help people learn how to sing. These online vocal coaches are very confusing when explaining their ideas. Everyone has their own interpretation of what is healthy for the voice and what \u201ccorrect technique\u201d is, and so they place ideas that contradict other teacher\u2019s beliefs. Also, a lot of these vocal coaches rely on pseudoscience to back up their claims on how the voice works, making a lot of what they say unreliable. When I was introduced to all this new information in singing, I came out of every singing video either confused or believing something that was not true. If you want to risk it and check out some YouTube vocal coaches, I will recommend Carl John Franz, who has some pretty good methods on getting your voice working efficiently with proper technique. Another good one is New York Vocal Coaching, which is a nice vocal coaching channel that covers a lot of information in singing. Tristan Paredes is a pretty good vocal teacher who backs up a lot of his claims with science, but he doesn\u2019t have many vocal lessons on his channel. Recently he\u2019s been reacting to other singers and critiquing them. Remember to keep in mind that many of these vocal coaches have different definitions for terms that describe certain sounds in the voice (Ex. \u201chead voice\u201d or \u201cmixed voice\u201d) PS: If you are interested in joining an online singing community filled with learning singers and vocal teachers, you can join Tristan Paredes\u2019 discord server here. Here you can ask us any questions related to singing if you are confused about anything. Good luck on your singing! ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on which level of singing you want to reach. If you want to just sing better overall you can find a lot of tips in all over youtube really. If what you want is to reach a high level of technique truth is you are unlikely to do it from free vocal programs. Anyway: Best free vocal program: Free Your Voice Best non-free vocal program: Eli Prinsen's Hybrid Vocal Technique The problem with free vocal programs and tips is that they are incomplete and are useless if you really want to become better, they just can help you to understand some tricks. So if you decide that you want to buy a vocal program I recommend you HVT. If you want it to work, you really need to pay attention and be 100% sure that you are doing exactly what he\u2019s telling you, specially with the zipped vocal chords trick, you need to make sure that you are doing it correct. At the beggining you\u2019ll strain but as you practice you need to try to make all the tension with your diaphragm. If you decide to buy it I tell you that\u2019s the most important exercise in the program so make really sure you are doing it correctly. Finally, HVT is specially for rock, metal and pop singing, it teaches you resonance, range, vibrato, breathing, support, warm ups, cool downs and vowel modifications mostly. Before you buy the program I recommend you to check the free vocal program I mentioned. It teaches you a couple things about breathing and support which are useful to understand what it isn\u2019t explained very well in the HVT program. Because it explains it but at least I got the feeling that I didn\u2019t know if I was doing it correctly, and I wasn't, so searching in youtube and google I found that free vocal program that explains it a lot better.
