Don\u2019t judge them and complain unless you want them to get angry. You can leave if you can\u2019t stand to listen to it. If they prefer their music to you, then you haven\u2019t lost a good friend. ",

            "answer_text": "You means his music taste or the music he writes. If he is your freind, and your taste diverge, you can either say the music is Good, hear it once or twice and he will be happy or the risky way, tell him you dont like the music much. However if he wrote that music, depends. Does He acccepts critics, if so tell him, that for you the music lacks something, maybe lacks that sweet beat. Or just say its Good and survive, may be painfull for you in long term. Either way, i recomend for you to keep it for your self unless your freind accept crit, you don't want to destroy your self estem. ",
