            "answer_text": "Shri Purandaradasa is considered Sangeetha Pithamaha of Carnatic Music. Even Saint Thyagaraja has acknowledged his contribution. Though nearly 475000 compositions were said to be created by him, hardly 700 have survived. He has mainly composed in Kannada, his mother tongue and a few in Sanskrit as well. He is revered even by the Hindustani Musicians as Mian Tansen\u2019s Guru, Swamy Haridas, was believed to be a disciple of Shri Purandaradasa. There are umpteen krithis of this great saint, which are household songs, not only in Karnataka, but also in Tamilnadu, from where I hail. It was Smt ML Vasanthakumari, who had popularised the Dasarnamas through her concerts and her mother Smt Lalithangi edited a music book of Dasar Namas. Please enjoy the eternally popular songs like Narayana ( Suddha Dhanyasi ), Jagadhodharana ( Kaapi ) etc from well known artists. ",
