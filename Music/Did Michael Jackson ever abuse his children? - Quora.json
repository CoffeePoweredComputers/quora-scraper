            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not going to go there regarding guilt or innocence as there is no concrete proof either way. The facts are that Michael\u2019s special friends were always those outside his family. They were always boys in a certain age range. There was always a pattern regarding the progress of the friendships and involvement of their families, especially the mothers. . Most of the boys either did not have fathers or had distant dysfunctional fathers. There was a pattern to how each boy was discarded or replaced as they reached the teenage years. There were 3 boys who were exceptions to being discarded for very practical reasons I won\u2019t get into. There was a pattern to the boys being given expensive gifts, special favors, advantages or rewards they desired most and which their families could never have provided. These types of pedophiles are referred to as friendly aquaintence pedophiles. They never seek out family members. They prefer other people\u2019s children. They make the child feel special and highly valued. They distance the child from their own family and isolate them, making them emotionally bonded to the abuser. They befriend the child in an atmosphere of caring, kindness and mentoring . They know how to gain their trust, love and loyalty. The sexual contact becomes a part of the relationship that the pedophile convinces the victim is normal and natural . Michael did spend time with and travel with his nephews , never his nieces. He prefered the company of boys. He preferred the company of other people\u2019s boys. These boys had sisters. He did not befriend the sisters. He did have many photo ops with the sisters and entire families of the boys when he had to include them on trips or Neverland visits. ",

            "answer_text": " No, never having been abused as a child himself he would never do that to his children or any child. MJ haters may say whatever they want but his kids were there and they should know and they said he was an excellent father.  Paris said so herself at his funeral and she needed a life coach to help her get over his death. She had turned her room into a shrine for Michael with his pictures all over the room until a therapist told her to take them all down so as to be able to move on. His kids meant everything to him and that\u2019s why he left all his money to them, not his siblings or nephews or nieces, but his three kids, whether he biologically fathered them or not. It is for them he accepted to do the 50 live shows in London, which arguably killed him. He put masks on their faces so as to protect them from the media and his bodyguards said that when they played in a playground he would stay in the car and cry because he couldn\u2019t go out and play with them for they would get mobbed.  Michael Jackson loved genuinely all children not only in words but in actions too. He gave over 300 hundred million dollars to charity, most of which for children, and left 20% of his now 1 billion dollar Estate to charities, mostly for kids. His children have now 100 million dollar networth each and thus they will never have to work a single day in their life.  ",

Sad to say. Let me answer your question with a question; Is it abusive when kids, who are either adopted or conceived artificially are denied the right to EVER know who their biological parents are? (Rather it's to know their hereditary medical history or their heritage is besides the point) I think it\u2019s a cruel thing to do to a child, to hide the truth about their identity and let strangers reveal it maliciously to them. In this case strangers being journalists reporting this. In 2011 there were stories that in July 2008 MJ had a dentist improperly put Blanket, age 6 at the time, under unnecessary anesthesia. The Nevada Board of Dental Examiners sanctioned the dentist for not having a permit to do this. So make of that what you will.  ",

Michael Jackson will always be \u201cthe abuser\u201d till the end of times and no one can change that in the head of man and this is very sad. People love to talk bad of the gifted. Why is it that even if nothing was found to make him guilty of the accusations, people still have doubts? Humans see love and think thier is something bad underneath it and it is easier to accuse and see the bad side then just accept that this man was good!!! I don\u2019t think MJ ever abused children and he made sure to help kids as much as he could. You could see the love he had for them. You could see how much he cared for his children. NO Michael Jackson did not abuse any of his kids. I can not believe he could do any harm to them. One day God will make every one see that he was just a loving man and that day he will finally be in peace. Stop thinking of the bad rumors and look at all the good things he did. He did much more for humanity than the rest of us! ",

Seeing love was seeing Michael with his children, there was no other relationship that he was in that compared to it, none. Michael was hell bent on giving them all he had of himself, he wanted them to be loved and feel loved, he wanted to raise them correctly and give them what he could. I think that most people know that he loved his children very much and I have never read or heard about him being abusive to them. Even if I had I would never have believed it because as we all know the lies about him traveled fast and the truth always takes a back seat as it does with a lot of people, but Michael was a good father and he never abused them, he never abused any child.

He loved his children they were his life, they were the reason he got up in the morning and started his day. He was a father that would change their nappy, read them stories, play games etc just like normal dads stuff. Its so sad that people still judge him with these false ridiculous accusations he was found not guilty but his reputation was ruined and even in death his name and reputation tarnished. God bless you Michael you are and will always be the kindest generous human being may you be at peace and I am glad that you got to experience fatherhood ",

He was framed by extortionists, but the jury who cleared his name relied on the results of extensive and thorough investigations which included the confiscation and searching of his computers for child porn, the raiding of his Neverland home, and a humiliating strip-search. The investigations ended with no proof of guilt on his part. These guys who are now accusing him of molesting them are only doing it because they are broke. While he was alive, they as adults didn't accuse him. They were financially stable then. But now, they are broke, and their lazy selves only want easy money, so they accuse him of molesting them. Michael did not molested anybody. He is being framed all over again by people who defended him during his trial. They cannot be trusted as they are proven perjurers. You've got to make research about Michael, then you'll find out that these guys are liars. ",

Sadly, there are people who still believe the false allegations/accusations made by those whose primary motives for spreading such false stories are greed, the desire to seek some form of attention from the media, and their wanting to become famous themselves \u2014\u2014 through association with a well-known celebrity \u2014\u2014 pure and simple.

His children were brought up with love & discipline and were well mannered and polite. Considering their nomadic life and uber famous father, it is a remarkable testament to how well Micheal raised them to be as normal as they were. Just watch videos of them as children with him. The mutual love and respect they had for one another is inspiring. There are numerous stories told by their personal chef, bodyguards, etc. about how soft spoken and polite his children were. Having been an abused child himself, Micheal vowed to give his children the true childhood he never had. ",

He was such a great father and a good person with a big heart. Only people that want to see the image the media presents, would believe such ridiculous claims. Kathy Hilton has watched him interact and take care of his kids. She has praised him many times as a good father along with Michael Flatley. ",
