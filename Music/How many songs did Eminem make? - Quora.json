            "answer_text": "To further drill down on the answer provided by Jordan McBride, Jordan McBride's answer to How many songs did Eminem make? And Lucas Martin Lucas Martins's answer to How many songs did Eminem make? Not only does Eminem and in fact most rappers (see footnote 1) write all their own songs, but there are more albums to ad to the list. Eminem released the Slim Shady EP without a record deal as well as a full length album titled Infinite. He also released an EP as a duo with Royce Da 5\u20199 under the moniker \u201cBad Meets Evil\u201d and then later a full length album, called Bad Meets Evil: The Sequel. Eminem fronted the rap group \u201cD12\u201d and released another two label backed major release albums. That\u2019s all I can think of, that was missing from the previous posts in terms of officially released songs. There are however some awesome \u201cunreleased\u201d (meaning the songs were never made commercially available) songs written by Eminem they are easy to find on YouTube and off the top of my head would probably increase his total number of released songs by about eight or so. (If you would like some of the titles so you can look them up let me know) I\u2019m not going to bother to do the math on everything mentioned above for one reason, we\u2019ll never really know how many songs Eminem has written because for everything that we can tally up there would be 100 songs in a notebook or trashcan somewhere that will never see the light of day. Eminem is a prolific lyricist I encourage you to delve deep into his catalog and enjoy everything it has to offer it has to offer. FOOTNOTE It\u2019s a big deal in hip-hop that all (most) rappers write their own lyrics. With other genres of music It\u2019s far more common for someone else to write a song and sell it to another artist to perform. Since the entire point of hip-hop is not so much the music but the message or at least at its roots that\u2019s what it was there\u2019s a different mindset when it comes to the lyrics of the songs.",

            "answer_text": "As of September 8, 2018, Eminem had 344 songs, according to Ethan James's answer to How many songs did Eminem make?. Since then, Em has released \u201cMusic To Be Murdered By\u201d, \u201cHomicide\u201d, \u201cRemember the Name\u201d, and \u201cThe Adventures of Moon Man & Slim Shady\u201d- not in this order, so don\u2019t attack me in the comments; this is just the order I just remembered them in. If Eminem had 344 songs in September 2018, the rap god has three more songs now because of \u201cHomicide\u201d, \u201cRemember the Name\u201d, and \u201cThe Adventures of Moon Man & Shady\u201d being single. That\u2019s 347. Now, \u201cMusic to be Murdered By\u201d, possibly Eminem\u2019s biggest release since 2018\u2019s \u201cKamikaze\u201d, was released. The album, which was based off of Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s 1958 eponymous album, has 20 songs.
