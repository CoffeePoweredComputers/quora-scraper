            "answer_text": "I guess I will add my three cents worth, since that's about how much interest I have in Elton John....ooops I mean his music. I went to a concert of his back in @ 1973 I believe when he was big time and wearing wack-a-doodle costumes. My guy friends loved him because he was so strange. It was a college thing liking the oddest oddball in the culture. His concert was pretty entertaining because he wore those big glasses and wigs and psychedelic costumes. The highlight was him dancing on top of the grand piano in these stilleto boots. The songs were fun. \"Rocket Man\", \"Bennie and The Jets\" and \"Crocodile Rock\". For Oklahoma City in the 70's this was big time! But you have to remember Elton John's songs were really Bernie Taupin's creations. Bernie was a fine lyricist. Basically, Elton John was just a nightclub pianist. After the split from Taupin, Elton John ( who was mediocre then) became even more mediocre.The thing that has always bugged me about Elton John is his reliance on basic chords. That is all he knows how to play - CHORDS. And he's a BANGER!  Bang, bang, bang....same chord, same chord, same chord. But folks look at this and say...\"Oh, look how fast he plays such a gorgeous white piano. \" They think he's a genius! Listen carefully to his early songs : \"Song For You\", \"Candle In The Wind\", \"Daniel\". These are beautiful songs BECAUSE Bernie Taupin had a wonderful style with imagery and metaphor and emotion. Elton had to massage the beauty of the lyrics so as not to crush their sensitivity. But alone and even with other lyricists, Elton has no discipline. He has no one to say..\"STOP! That's in bad taste you idiot\". Today Elton John delivers the quintessential Liberace-like formula that brings in the bucks. He was never talented, he couldn't play the piano worth squat, and sadly he still believes his own hype.

            "answer_text": "Elton John is actually very boring. I think people like him because he wore outlandish costumes and had catchy songs in the 70\u2019s that were written by other people. Then when he came out as gay people really started thinking he was a genius even more than they did when he first became popular. Elton John is a milquetoast talent wise. I never understood people\u2019s obsession with making lounge singers into millionaires. Elton John and Billy Joel are basic piano players that are glorified lounge performers. Neither of them have any real talent. People love to take boring soft rock and think its oh so grand. Does anyone who was born after 1960 actually like these guys or other bores like Barry Manilow or Neil Diamond, or the cringiest of them all, Joe Cocker ? piano driven pop rock isn\u2019t really ideal rock music, its just cruise ship music for baby boomers. Furthermore, the boring and aging soft rock obsessed buffoons that enjoy this type of \u201cmusic\u201d are the same people who are always looking for new and annoying music to listen to in an attempt to appear hip. there\u2019s nothing worse than a 56 year old woman humming or bobbing their head to Justin Timberlake or Ariana Grande or \u2026.Imagine Dragons (yuck!) Basically, Elton John is the embodiment of boring pop filler that seems to grow like cancer in every crevice in the musical world. I try not to take anyone who likes his music seriously. ",
