            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A, James. No question. The proof has been with us for decades, because: Many, many crappy plywood guitars from brands like Harmony, Sears etc. from the 40s-60s are still doing fine, and they were pretty bad by today\u2019s standards. Think about it. Those guitars are older than I am, and I\u2019m old. Yet people still play and trade them. Boom. There\u2019s your proof. But wait, there\u2019s more.Build quality of your average Squier these days is way better than the average Fender in the mid 60s-early 70s, and those Fenders aren\u2019t going anywhere despite the terrible QA Fender had then. Woods were better on average in the 70s, I admit, but your signal chain pretty much wipes out any differences there.Remember Squiers are made in big factories with high-precision CNC machines to tolerances unknown in guitar mass production for the first 350 years of the guitar\u2019s existence. High tolerance means better fit, means less chance of problems.For years Fenders were made using worn jigs and fixtures from the original factory. These had slowly lost their precision and fit. Meanwhile Squiers after around 1995 or so were made from newer machines on closely watched assembly lines built from scratch, with the things they\u2019d learned from Fender\u2019s mistakes over the years.Squiers are just fine. And don\u2019t even get me started on the higher end Squiers, which are CRAZY good quality per dollar.My guitar range from a $25 Squier that sounds fantastic to a $25,000 1959 Fender that also sounds fantastic. I\u2019m not the least ashamed or uncomfortable playing Squiers. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure. Any guitar can last decades or centuries as many have already replied. As others have noted pots and switches and other hardware will last decades but eventually wear out and need to be replaced. Pretty much every moving part will eventually wear. And while they don\u2019t move your frets and nut also fall into this category. They may be stationary but the string itself moves and the string will eventually wear both the frets and the nut. So assuming you bend strings and or use the whammy bar the frets will need dressed. Each time that\u2019s done you remove metal from the taller frets so that they match the lowest fret. There\u2019s a finite amount of times this can be done but I\u2019d still expect the frets to last decades. Playing style has a LOT to do with this. My 1984 Squier is still going strong. But the frets are getting worn down. It\u2019s one of the reasons I don\u2019t play it as much as I used to. Japanese wire and American and European wire is sturdy stuff. But as production has shifted Squier quality has gone up and down with it. I\u2019m not going to say it\u2019s bad fret wire categorically across the board but once production shifted from Japan fretwire becomes a bit of a variable quality. As prices have dropped relative to inflation costs must be recovered somewhere. Pots. Fretwire. Switches. Tuners etc have all undergone cost saving measures at some point in time. I\u2019ve worked on enough heavily played Squiers to say that while not what I would necessarily call the factory wire sub par in all cases it does wear out faster than better wire you find on better and pricier instruments. It\u2019s simply something to be aware of on nearly all entry level brands and truthfully most play these guitars as their primary guitar for a few years then upgrade keeping it as a spare. My advice is play it and let your kids worry about the refret. But if you play it long enough and hard enough the bill may come due on your shift. Just something to be aware of and at this price point it absolutely would not keep me from buying a guitar. And all the other guitars in this price bracket are probably using the same quality wire.

            "answer_text": "Of course it can. Maybe the wood quality isn\u2019t quite as good, and maybe the hardware is a little cheaper than an American made Strat, but a Squier Strat is really no different than any solid body electric guitar. With the exception of the geared tuners, pots, and maybe tremolo (if you use that. . .I don\u2019t) it has no moving parts. So long as it isn\u2019t grossly abused, there is ZERO reason why a Squier can\u2019t last a lifetime, with the following caveats. Eventually the pots (on any electric guitar) wear out, become \u201cscratchy\u201d and need to be replaced. The tuning machines may eventually wear out and need replacement, though good quality ones will last a LONG time. And if you play a lot, especially if you BEND a lot, the frets will wear out and will need to be replaced. On a Squier it might be more cost-effective to replace the entire neck. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a squire Tele, that I bought in 1995 and it continues to operate as it did the first day. It doesn't stay in tune very well after playing it with gusto, but if just strumming it holds up for several hours. I'm certain that it won't just disintegrate one day. In fact with only a little upgrade it would even stay in tune. I bought it for an art project, not to play, and kept it because I liked the way it looked hanging on the wall. I don't use it for anything other than decoration, and almost gave it to a neighbor kid once but he decided he wasn't interested in guitar. ",
