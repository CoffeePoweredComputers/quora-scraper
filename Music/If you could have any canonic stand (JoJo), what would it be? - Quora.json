Other Stands like Gold Experience (not even necessarily Requiem, though that\u2019s obviously top tier shit and given the choice I would totally take it), Whitesnake, and Soft and Wet are certainly close contenders though. Heaven\u2019s Door\u2019s three primary weaknesses are its lacking speed compared to the worst threats out there (I call anything less than A Rank speed lacking), its lacking raw power, and its inability to read its user and make permanent edits. All can largely be solved via tattoos. Direct combat is pretty easily solved by tattooing statements to the effect that I am a master of the Spin and the Ripple into my flesh, especially since mastery of those techniques grants use of Hermit Purple and Ball Breaker, since those Stands belong to the techniques, not the users of those techniques, bypassing the \u2018one stand per user\u2019 rule. Hell, with a bit of work I could bootstrap myself up to the level of an Ultimate Lifeform and make beneficial changes to my personality. And then in general Heaven\u2019s Door is a fantastically potent information gathering Stand with its long range and ability, and also acts as a top tier support Stand. ",

So the evolution of the stand doesn't mean you lose the use of that act. Act 1 has an excellent range and can affect your opponent psychologically. Act 2 can essentially change the properties of any object depending on the sound effect used. The only limit to act 2s power is your own imagination. For example you could electrify an object by using the \u201cZAP!\u201d sound effect. Then act 3 is just a generally powerful stand. You can completely imobilate one object or person at a time. Making any enemy completely vulnerable to you. Anyway these are just my thoughts, honourable mentions are ZA WARUDO (2\u201310 seconds isn't enough time to be useful in everyday life). Also Mandom because I could rewind time and try again when I say awkward things during conversations. ",
