            "answer_text": "For me, that would have to be Metallica. In the spring/summer of 1988, I started to explore metal good and proper. At first, I knew about Poison, Ratt, Alice Cooper, Def Leppard, and their like. While I enjoyed this, I had the feeling that there was even more to it. And thus, a couple friends introduced me to a few even heavier bands, including Anthrax, Slayer, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Megadeth and Metallica. There were many good bands of that era, with each achieving a degree of success in their own rights. Having said that, I think it can be agreed that Metallica is easily the most famous example of them all. ",
