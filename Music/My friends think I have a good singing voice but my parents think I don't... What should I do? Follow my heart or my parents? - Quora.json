            "answer_text": "You may take the positive inputs from your friends and at the same time analyse the reason for the negative feedback from your parents.  Positive feedback is a motivating factor, which will help us in moving forward, whereas negative feedback is an important factor too for us to correct and develop ourselves on our way forward with perfection. So, you may analyse and work on this part. However, listen only to your heart and intuition. Because, as Steve Jobs said, only they (your heart & intuition) know what you want to become. If your heart asks you to sing..then do not stop it for anyone or for any reason..follow it, work on it sincerely..it will surprise your parents one day..  \u200b ",

            "answer_text": "If the question is about whose heart to follow, the answer is your heart. Your parents have themselves to follow what their heart wants.If the question is about your voice, I think you can get out and find out, you can take tests, try singing before audience in whatever possible way. Get feedback. Keep going. Take care of from where your daily physiological needs are coming from, food, shelter and clothing. Following passion needs a healthy body to pursue it. ",
