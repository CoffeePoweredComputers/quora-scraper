            "answer_text": "OK, first of all I need to mention that I\u2019m more of a Once than a Blink so my opinions might be biased but I\u2019ll try not to be since I love both groups equally. So here we go. *Disclaimer: I wont talk about fame (YouTube views/popularity), English fluency and visuals since they don\u2019t influence any of my opinions. Also, this is going to be a very lengthy answer and I\u2019m practically writing this during school, so prepare for a very, very long read. Vocals: Although I personally prefer Jeongyeon\u2019s vocals, Jihyo is no doubt the best out of Twice because of her technique and stability, followed by Nayeon, Jeongyeon and Mina. Chaeyoung, Sana and Tzuyu are also pretty good. Momo and Dahyun are probably the weakest vocalists, but even so they\u2019re pretty stable in live performances. Now talking Blackpink; Ros\u00e9 is definitely the best out of the bunch since she\u2019s the main vocal, followed by Jisoo, Jennie and Lisa. Ros\u00e9 is my bias in Blackpink and I know lots of people dislike her vocals, but I personally love it and I think she\u2019s a pretty decent main vocal. Jisoo also has a good vocal technique but probably has more stability than Ros\u00e9. Out of the leads, I feel like Jennie falls short of Jisoo as her voice suits more to rapping than vocals. Finally, Lisa, being the sub-vocalist is the weakest out of the four, but she\u2019s improving quite a lot lately. Verdict: Overall I would have to say Twice over Blackpink, mainly because of their stability, which is what Blackpink needs to focus on. I hope they can improve more in their future comebacks. Dance: Twice\u2019s main dancers are Momo and Mina while Blackpink has Lisa as main and Ros\u00e9 as lead. I\u2019m not a dancer so this is purely based on my opinions. Main dancers: I think that Momo and Lisa are pretty equal in terms of technique and stage presence, however since we haven\u2019t seen Lisa\u2019s full potential Momo edges her out by a little. Momo has been in numerous dance performances along with Mina (they created the dance themselves), while Lisa has only done covers, so for now it\u2019s Momo over Lisa.Lead dancers: Twice and Blackpink\u2019s second best dancers are Mina and Ros\u00e9 respectively. This is really hard to choose since both are my biases from each groups! Anyway, I\u2019ll quickly mention what their strengths are: Mina excels in technique, sharpness and free styling, while Ros\u00e9 has excellent stage presence and facial expressions. Again, Mina wins over Ros\u00e9 since we haven\u2019t seen Ros\u00e9\u2019s full potential yet.Verdict: Twice over Blackpink Rapping: I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll need to explain for this one since we all know that Blackpink wins. Blackpink is a rap-heavy group, which explains why Jennie and Lisa are better than Chaeyoung and Dahyun since they obviously get more training. I do have to mention that Chaeyoung gets some bonus points since she writes her own raps. Verdict: Blackpink over Twice Concepts: This is a hard one, especially since both groups have completely concepts so I\u2019ll talk about them separately. Twice has a cuter and energetic concept. Although I prefer more of a girl crush/feminine types of concepts I love how Twice can pull this off naturally while not looking like 5 year olds. All of their songs have the same cute vibe, but I love how they have different themes for each song. They\u2019ve done a zombie apocalypse, romance movie parodies, tropical/beach, Halloween party, witches, aliens, city vlogging, camera lenses (don\u2019t know how to explain this but this was in Cheer Up), sleepover, clones with geometrical maze and recently a more mature, futuristic theme with Fancy. That took a while, but it just shows how versatile Twice can be with just one main concept.Blackpink mainly has a girl-crush type of concept, which leads to their popularity in the western side since these types of concepts are more common. However, they\u2019ve been able to show different styles like a slow song for Stay, EDM-based music for Playing with Fire and their pink side in AIIYL, which is my personal favourite. Even though they\u2019ve been doing girl-crush for a while now, I\u2019d love to see another AIIYL-type of song, but I know this will probably not be accepted by most of their newer fans. I still have high hopes though!Verdict: Draw. This purely depends on your taste. Management: JYP over YG, period. I\u2019ll move on. Comebacks: Twice has 2\u20133 comebacks per year since debut, not including Japanese releases, while Blackpink normally has 1. I feel like the lack of content resulted in many Blinks unstanning, which I understand since YG is a trashbag anyway. I\u2019ll talk about Blackpink first: I won\u2019t lie, my hype kinda died down lately because of KTL and how they\u2019ve been very repetitive with their comebacks. As I said I\u2019m hoping for another pink concept and of course Ros\u00e9\u2019s solo, which I highly doubt we won\u2019t get. As for Twice, I never get bored of their comebacks. I a pretty new Once so I don\u2019t know much about their past comebacks, but I absolutely love Fancy (my favourite Twice song). Fancy is literally the comeback of 2019 since it was a masterpiece and in my opinion, Twice\u2019s best comeback. I\u2019m also looking forward to Feel Special, their upcoming comeback, mainly because they all look stunning in their teasers, Momo\u2019s forehead and Mina coming back! Twice have been transitioning into a more mature vibe, while not completely leaving out their cuteness into their comebacks. Verdict: Twice over Blackpink, mainly because of their consistency. Songs: I won\u2019t go too deep into this since Blackpink only has 15 songs while Twice probably has 60\u201370 by now. Twice: what I love about Twice\u2019s songs are how each member play a role in them and not a single one is forgotten. I have to admit that Twice\u2019s old line distributions have been pretty trash, but this has definitely changed with songs like What is Love, Signal, Fancy and Likey. I also love how the member\u2019s voices fit each part of the songs perfectly, like Nayeon for the chorus, Mina for the bridge, Chaeyoung and Dahyun for the rap parts, Sana and Momo for the killing parts and Jihyo for the high notes and adlibs, alongside Jeongyeon. I also need to mention the masterpiece that is Fancy, aka song of the year. Feel Special needs to be really good to live up to Fancy, if not better, so I\u2019m expecting a lot!If you\u2019re a hardcore Blink (or Blonk), get ready because I\u2019m about to spill some tea here. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love Blackpink, I love my girls but they\u2019ve been kind of disappointing with their recent songs. I loved D4, but I hated KTL to be honest. It was practically the same as D4 but the chorus was really empty and I was anticipating a legendary dance break but was let down. I love their side tracks though, DKWTD is my favourite from the KTL album.Verdict: Twice over Blackpink Choreography: This kind of connects to their contrasting concepts so I won\u2019t spend too long here. While I feel like both Blackpink and Twice\u2019s dances are pretty easy to learn, I have to give this to Twice since their complex formations make their dances slightly harder to learn than Blackpink. It took me 3 days to learn the WIL chorus choreo, compared to just minutes for D4\u2019s chorus choreo. Twice\u2019s choreos also have specific hand gestures that make them more iconic, like the rockstar gesture in Fancy, the OK in Yes or Yes, the T in TT and drawing a ? in the air with WIL. Verdict: Twice over Blackpink Personalities: Twice over Blackpink. Blackpink are very entertaining considering that they only have four members. They have proven this though the Blackpink House series, BP tour diaries and recently BP summer diaries. But I do have to say that while Jisoo is the funniest and overall has the best personality, the other three kind of look fake in a way? Like their stage performances are badass and stuff, while they act cutesy and aegyo-ish offstage. Idk that just kind of confuses me.First of all I have to mention that Twice has an advantage here since they are a 9 member group. Anyway, like any other JYP group, Twice are literal crackheads! JYP wasn\u2019t joking when he said that his groups have the best personalities, this can be clearly seen with Twice. I\u2019m fairly new to the Once fandom, but I can see that we\u2019re pretty chill as none of the girls empower each other in terms of personality, although Sana and Dahyun are the loudest and best personalities in my opinion. But even Mina and Tzuyu, the quietest members have their funny moments and as an introvert I can definitely relate to them.Verdict: Twice over Blackpink Equality between members: I feel like it's no surprise when I say Twice over Blackpink. I see way more Lisa and Jennie solo stans compared to Ros\u00e9 or Jisoo stans (or even OT4 stans). Even though I'm Ros\u00e9 biased I try to stan OT4 as much as I can. Whereas in Twice, all 9 members have a pretty equal amount of fans, even with Sana, Nayeon and Tzuyu being the most popular members. The Once fandom is also pretty chill and there are hardly any fanwars, compared to Blinks (here I'm generalising when I say that Blinks are very agressive and defensive, although most of the fandom is pretty nice). Final Verdict: Twice over Blackpink. End of essay, I'll start my actual English essay now. Thanks for reading peeps, stream Fancy aka soty ",

            "answer_text": "Which is better, Twice or Blackpink? What is the reason if one is or isn't better than the other?  Sometimes you build, sometimes you destroy. It\u2019s time to put the best up against the best. The long overdo battle of the greats is at hand. The clash of the titans! Ecks vs. Sever! (lousy movie, btw). Hulk Hogan vs. The Ultimate Warrior! (dating myself). It\u2019s my present loves taking on my first loves! Fight!  Visual:  Sweat pouring down our faces, nerves twitching out of control at the Earth-shattering visuals here. Tall, powerful Tzuyu. 4D uniqueness in Jisoo. I\u2019d like to build this up into a stronger match than it is, but Tzuyu unloads with a flurry of arrows right on target. With a hair flip. Twice wins this round. Main Vocals:  I\u2019ve made it no secret in the past that, despite the hate from naysayers, I love Rose\u2019s voice. Her fluctuations and sound outdo Jihyo\u2019s powerful projection. As much as I like Jihyo, I\u2019ve never put her \u201cup there\u201d with most other Main Vocals. For that matter, I\u2019ve never done that with Rose either, I just love her voice. Blackpink. Lead Vocals:  Another thing I\u2019ve said before is that I really like Jeongyeon\u2019s ability to go from sugary sweet to rock hard. Nayeon\u2019s husky tone is icing and gravy - hopefully not at the same time though. That would be gross. On the BP side, Jisoo\u2019s deep, very different singing voice is also a favorite of mine. And while Jennie\u2019s vocals are very by-the-book and nothing sets her apart from anyone else singing in her key, I do very much like the way she sings. I don\u2019t rank either team very high when it comes to singing live, however. Fact is, my pros and cons are equal on both accounts. It\u2019s a tie. Sub Vocals:  So, there\u2019s this drink called Absinthe, right? It\u2019s outlawed in 90% of the world because it\u2019s poisonous. So it not only makes you drunk but it also causes hallucinations. The French army used to get wasted on it, then kick a ton of ass in wars. After it was banned, the French never won another war. Lisa is the French army after Absinthe was outlawed. Twice wins easily. Main Dancer:  I swear, ever since people started sending me these battles, the best category has always been this one. And I love that because I love dancers. This truly is the fun part for me. Lisa is amazing and I roll my eyes every time someone tries to talk her down. She can probably do anything, but Momo has proven how versatile she is over and over again. In truth, it\u2019s barely a battle no matter how great Lisa is because Momo is the French army drunk as shit on Absinthe. Twice. Rap Vocals:  Alas, this is NEVER a fun category for me. I\u2019m a rap snob, so I always look forward to a good fight here and I never get one. Strangely enough, this is one of the better pairings I've seen. Of the 4 of them, I only consider Chaeyoung as the one who always really cared about being a great rapper. Of the 4 of them, Jennie has the most impressive swag and delivery. Lisa and Dahyun are about the same, I\u2019d say. Though I prefer Lisa here. My bitching about Blackpink raps have always been that the lyrics are often ridiculous. My bitching about Twice raps have always been that they were strange at first and lacked power, but got better over time. Jennie\u2019s flow can be dope, but Twice\u2019s rap line hits really good beats. Damn, this got harder the more I thought about it. In the end, I want Jennie to carry her team over the finish line here, so Blackpink wins. EDIT: Update Oct 2020. Lisa has really impressed me lately. I don't ever do updates, but I will today. BP slaughters Twice here. Overall: I dislike a lot of Blackpink\u2019s lyrics, rap or otherwise, but I love their music, what little of it there is. I can\u2019t say that about Twice. Twice has such varied melodies that hit, that I have to say that they do a ton of things right. Their choreography is superior to Blackpink\u2019s, their songbook is bigger, more interesting, and better. Both teams kill the visuals, but there\u2019s more of Twice to \u201cdrool\u201d over. Twice has a better company, they have more comebacks and no matter how much ass Blackpink kicks in America, Twice never forgets where they came from. They adore their fans, they work their asses off and the more I see myself writing this stuff down, I lean even harder in their favor. Twice runs away with this one. WINNER: TWICE.  Thanks for reading. Okay bye. EDIT: I thought I'd updated this a long time ago. ",
