            "answer_text": "Let me tell you a story of my friend, Mike. When Mike was in elementary school he would complain that his mom didn\u2019t buy him his video game. He complained, complained, and complained. When Mike was in middle school he was worried about not being the most popular kid and that Jordan was much more of an athletic stud than he was. Mike always wanted to be the strongest in his class. When Mike was in high school he was mad that his volleyball team didn\u2019t make the state finals. He felt sorrow when his main group of friends from middle school stopped talking to him. He was confused when Chelsea stopped talking to him out of the blue (fuck chelsea btw). When Mike was in college he decided it wasn\u2019t for him, so he dropped out of college. He went to pursue his dream of becoming a professional basketball player and when he realized he was not up to par with the elites, he gave up. When Mike was old his heart was giving out. It was then that he realized that complaining to his mom did nothing, that being the strongest out of a bunch of middle school kids is meaningless, that Chelsea is a piece of shit, and that his dream of becoming a basketball player was only 1 of his many dreams. Most importantly, Mike realize that all of his sorrows of the past were temporary. They came and then they left. The biggest sorrow of Mike\u2019s life was not realizing that sorrow came from within. Mike made his sorrow and when it was time, he decided to get rid of it. ",

            "answer_text": "There are all kinds of sorrow, and all kinds of occasions for sorrow. I have experienced many of them, from the deeply personal to the global. But if you want to know the single most painful pang of sorrow for me, the answer may surprise you. It was the moment when I knew that it was time to do the right thing and give my lovely, sweet, beautiful kitten Ariel a merciful death. Why was this so painful, given the incredible range of things there are to bewail in this world? 1. My kitten was purely innocent. Her illness was incurable and she was suffering. She certainly did not, nor could not, have done anything to \"deserve\" such a fate. 2. She could not understand what was happening or what was coming. There was nothing I could do to comfort her.  3. The responsibility for her death was mine and mine alone. 4. We had a true bond of love. I knew I was going to miss her and mourn her for the rest of my life. 5. She trusted me completely. And that meant I had to do right by her even though it was incredibly painful to me.  Love is the source of the deepest sorrow.And it is entirely worth it. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A Hima Ghiri Amidst all the chaos and the hullabaloo revolving around the deadly covid-19, and the recent announcement of 21 days National lockdown. I happened to stumble upon a video shared by one of the news channels on their social media handle. A rickshaw-puller along with two of his kids was roaming the empty streets of Delhi, in the hope of finding, at least a single traveler so that he can buy food for his starving kids. \u201cThe children haven't eaten for 2\u20133 days, and there's not a single grain of rice at home. Ever since the harmful virus has affected our country. People have stopped coming out of their houses. How are we supposed to survive if we don't get passengers? After the announcement of the lockdown, the price of basic necessities has shot higher. Look at us, we can't afford a morsel of a meal for the kids, leave alone dreaming of buying at double-triple rates.\u201d Trust me, I kept my phone aside and cried my heart out for some time. There was this feeling of uneasiness and sorrow churning deep in my gut. The helplessness in the father\u2019s eyes and those hunger-stricken innocent eyes kept flashing in front of my vision. I do not know, what the implications of covid will be. How far we will be able to come out a warrior, though each one of us is trying in their best spirit. But the daily wagers and the below poverty line are left with only two options: \u2018Die of hunger (with the lockdown)\u2019\u2018Die of covid (if on the road without the lockdown)\u2019When we are safely locked up in the warmth of our homes. We should also think about these people and urge those in power to not let them die out of their misfortune.  Image courtesy: http://getty images ",

            "answer_text": "If you asked me about my perspective , my feelings and experience on this topic then I am glad to share that . But , I don't know what's written in our holiest vedas and puranas about this topic. I researched alot but can't find direct answer . So, in my perspective and experience biggest sorrow is\u2026 Seeing someone DYING The one whom you love alot and they loved you back in the same way and even more than you and you can't do anything because it's not in your hand . No matter how greatest doctor you are, no matter how rich you are , now matter how many good powerful connections you have . You don't able to anything your money , pride , education seem worthless and meaningless . You see them in pain , you gonna shaked entirely but you can't able to do anything accept see them in pain and show them sympathy or give them some hope . But you know right . Seeing our parents getting old . . Our lovely parents how easily they said all the time \u201cyou are my child you may grown up by age but you still our small baby.. innocent ,cute , doesn't know about worldy wolf .\u201d I don't know why but our parents forget..\u201d No matter how much time pass and they become more and more old we never accept that they getting old they still our young , strong and superhero for us \u201c. Why they forget when we got our brain, since that time to still we see them as usual . Why and how they got wrinkles , their body pain which gone regular now , loosing working capacity or complains about weakness . Dear, parents we relate these things to us like we got pain due tough and hectic day in some occasiona . We thought that your wrinkles is nothing that things there because you may didn't take your nap properly , you gonna weak because you don't take your meal properly like us . We don't relate these things to your age . This is psychological ,okay . We don't accept that you gonna old as we become mature . Loosing your internal energy .. Go and search for motivation .. you found hundreds of videos and thousands of articles and books on this topic . Everyone has a story . How they are idiot once in a life and sudden become an UPSC topper , Bank manager , CA ,CM, Army etc .. How they deal with stress , depression and anxiety when they failed and how they just move on. You know what common thing you found in all these stories,articles and videos sharing ?You found they have dream . They have passion which never let them sleep whole night , which never let them live satisfied in what they have . No matter much they are poor ,rich or financial crisis crushed them they their dream , passion never let them to accept that condition . They have burning sensesation in their body which make them crazy to do anything and fought any battle . That passion,dream and that burning fire make them conquer of the world . But what if someone don't have these type of burning fire inside them . Those who never knew on which path they want to go and meet heart comfort . These type of people may have all talent but they don't know what's their aim and heart soothing palace is . They have no passion , no dream and burning fire take and they lived meaningless life . They just breathe . Remember Hrithik Roushan movie \u201c Lakshya\u201d . This movie based on that . Go and watch if you don't watch yet ! Loosing yourself .. I\u2019m very filmy . So , Do you watch a bollywood movie named \u201c Tamasha\u201d Ranbir and Deepika's movie ? If you watch that movie you can realised what happened if someone only dream die . The boy who is cool , laugh , talking and enjoying and playing in their life . He shown very lively . But life took a sudden turn and everything changed . His only dream die . He loose his self completely . He may had a job , a settled life but within him he was dead . He loose himself completely . Nothing make him happily . Or , sometime watch try this movie \u201c Henry searched for his Happiness\u201d . In that movie Henry lived a very awesome life . He was a psychiatrist and he had a very beautiful and supportive wife . Everything seem perfect . No financial crisis , no dream dying but there is something still missing in his life . He daily goes to his clinic listen , his patient suggest him medication and come back home on time . He lived great life but he was not happy . He get bored in his life now he did't feel any happiness . At last his patience broke up he told his wife and just run away from his daily boring life . He was on mission . Mission is \u201csearching for happiness \u201c. He went many countries , experience many things . And at last he found where is happiness . You may thought suddenly why I'm talking about movie . This is because only movie shows you real emotion and you can live all those emotions without having real onces in your life. So, this all may seem simple but believe me this situation gives intolerable sorrow and pain . ",

Irony of my life ? I despise being mediocre, and yet, I am as average as average gets. I know, I know. Success takes time and a shit load of hard work. And maybe then if you are a tad bit lucky, you may become exceptional at something. 22 and a half years on this blue planet, and I am yet to win at something. I have competed in lots of events, and lost so many times that I now have stopped keeping a count. Its only in the last few years, as I grew older and wiser, I learned a lot about myself and the reason for my failures. You see, I am what you call, \u201cA poor finisher\u201d. It sucks ! I start with a lot of enthusiasm. I just lose all of my focus and will towards the end. Has happened a lot with me, and I intend to change this attitude ASAP. What\u2019s my greatest sorrow you ask ? That would be knowing all of my limitations and yet being unable to move past them.  Suggestions and edits are welcome. :) Sources - Wordgasm (@wordgasminsta) \u2022 Instagram photos and videos ",

One day in the morning in my college I was reading a notice board which was in the month August. Then on september 5 (teacher's day), seniors (2nd year)came to my class and started teaching.And they shared first year experience also we spend some time with them planning about the freshers party. We had a nice time. Then one day one the boys sent an request on insta. So I thought just part of the friendship and I accepted it. That guy belongs to the same state were I belong to. We became very good frnds. After few days, he told that he is in love with me and saw me first time on that day in August when I went to read the notice board. I was shocked. He liked my attitude which he saw in my body language. But I am type of a girl who is not interested in relationships. I seriously hate that stuff. Then also I thought to accept him. Then I came to know that he is alcoholic &chain smoker so I decline his proposal which made me little emotional. I have never been into a relationship. And never gona happen in my life. Because now my full focus is on my career and my family. Thanks for reading\u2026 Have a good day\u2026take care Upvote my answer. U r free to suggest edits\u2026 Also comment\u2026 ",

Why not spend this small life being happy and loving. Slowly everybody goes, why not give them all the possible love in that small span of life. I am recognizing it , I am in the process. Know who really matters and who never did. Because you will not get a second chance everytime. I really regret that for a period of time I damn it didnot value my dear and near ones. I am rectyfing my mistakes. Thank God I realized it before it's too late. I even now know why it happened. We often take for granted the few people who always sacrifice for us. We take them for granted cause we know they won't leave us no matter what. But let's take a moment , realize their value and fall in love with those few people who always loved us, helped us in hard times, beared us when all others left. Thanks\u2026 ",

So I try to overcome the negative aspects of these thoughts, and instead of being filled with negative feeling, I try to take lessons from these experiences and improve my personality. After all, life is about experiencing and learning from failures.  ",

These failures, the thought of my failure puts me in deep sorrow. Especially those failures over which I didn't have control. Not me but my destiny controlled it. Sometimes, somethings are just not in your hand. You are helpless. This state of helplessness gives me sorrow. The fact that I can't control it or there's nothing I can do about it leaves me in pain and a sorrowful state. ",
