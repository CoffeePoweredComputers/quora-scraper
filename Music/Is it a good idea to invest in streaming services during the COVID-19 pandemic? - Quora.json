A lot more that are still concerned about the virus- and I think they should be- can pop their own popcorn and see all sorts of stuff for the single price of a movie ticket. I think the competition is pretty tough right now but Netflix is about $10 and the others hover around it. It appears that Netflix is having more customers and I assume the other are as well. Bottom line- the analysts that cover some of these think that people will keep the services after the virus is really contained. But it could take till next year- or even longer if no vaccine. In sum- I believe these services will keep many of those that have recently joined. . Zoom has also picked up customers and they should stay as well. Particularly if a lot of them will now work at home. ",

I am not big on streaming services, they sound expensive. To tell the truth, I am not even sure exactly what they encompass. If they include Gaia TV, I might subscribe myself. Right now I subscribed to some online classes that are absorbing my interest. That will not work for everyone. If it doesn\u2019t work for you, you can afford it, and streaming services will keep you home safe go for it. Hell, even if you can afford it do it. They are definitely cheaper than an extended hospital stay. Even if later on you are paying off a bill and cursing yourself for the indulgence, you will be alive doing it. Do what you need to do to stay safe at home \u2026 and wash your hands. ",
