            "answer_text": "Least problematic idols for me are Chaeyoung  Seulgi  Most for me are G-Dragon  Don\u2019t get me wrong, this man is an icon in his own right, but all the appropriation of my culture and blackface doesn\u2019t and will never sit right with me. Jennie  This was hard to say, but Jennie is extremely problematic. I first noticed when I was watching Blackpink content and cam across a video where Blackpink were getting interviewed and the interviewer had gave them gifts and everybody seemed excited, except for Jennie. She even rolled her eyes after opening the gift when she realized it was a phone. I get that people don\u2019t have to smile all the time, but at least be respectful. Another thing I noticed was the quality of her performances for she gave for her solo promotions and for her D4 promotions. In her D4 promotions, she lipsynced a lot and didn\u2019t really put much into the performances. But during her Solo performances, her energy was clearly present, her dancing was on point, and her vocals were mostly stable. And last but not least, the lazy dancing scandal. First of all, before y\u2019all attack me and say the scandal was cleared and she had an injured ankle, the poster of the article and the picture literally states in their bio that they aren\u2019t a reliable site. It also wasn\u2019t confirmed by YG either. The first thing I realized is how they \u201csolved\u201d the situation. YG takes down the video and Jennie starts dancing better. Then when the article came out all it did was confuse me more. The article states that her ankle got injured during their debut. Blackpink have been a group for 4 years. All blinks now that they\u2019ve had breaks. I\u2019ve gotten my arm broken before. It barely took 2 months to heal. Her having an injury for that long and never doing anything to fix it sound like bs to me. Sakura  She literally fatshamed one of her old bandmates then proceeded to act like her twitter was hacked. Yokoyama, AKB\u2019s current(?) captain exposed her for acting as if she sucks at physical activities to get pity and attention from fans. Even a Japanese MC called her out for being one of the fakest females in the whole entertainment industry. She honestly reminds me of \u2018The Boy Who Cried Wolf\u201d cause everytime she makes a mistake its hard to know if its truly a mistake or not. imgur.com (clip of her purposely making her team lose during a game.)

I\u2019m not sure about the MOST controversial since I feel like there are a lot of them (well it a looot but a pretty large number). But there is an idol who went to prison for trying to blackmail an actor, and another member from that same group was allegedly a sasaeng (obsessive fan who stalks, or engages in other behaviour constituting an invasion of the privacy of a Korean idol or other public figure). Their names are Dahee and Trinity. Both from the K-pop girl group, Glam. Glam was a BigHit group, and ever since their controversies, Bighit has never debuted a girl group again. Dahee  She and another actress tried to blackmail actor Lee Byung-hun for the about of $4.2 million. Trinity  She was allegedly a sasaeng fan Leeteuk from Super Junior. She posed as a CEO's daughter and the daughter of a producer to try to meet Leeteuk, and was known as \"Cussing Granny\" due to her swearing very often and aggressively.

            "answer_text": "Well problematic won't mean that they are bad. It will mean they cause a little problem wherever they go, like breaking something, mistaking, forgetting something important, making everyone tensed etc etc. From my view the first will be \u2026 BTS's RM/ Kim Namjoon. He is a nerd type and a talented idol, besides the leader of the band BTS. But he is a little problematic \ud83d\ude02 He breaks things whatever he touches, well I'm not 100% sure if he breaks whatever he touches, but maybe a few things were broken by him. That's why fans and his members stated he is problematic.    Hehe poor guy. But he did break music record kkkk. And another person is Exo's Kai,it's not invisible to fans that he breaks things whatever is infront of him. Like a several times he broke microphones at stage \ud83d\ude02 and a few times he was problematic around the reality shows like Exo's ladder games, arcade games, Knowing brothers, and the hilarious one was last year at knowing bros show he mistook Padding as Under the Panty in the game, still so many fans call him Panty guy, or panty oppa after that scene. Besides sometimes he's bad at rock paper scissors games.    This is where he mistook, under the panty in Shout in silence game.  Broke microphone and Suho's reaction. As maknae a line in the group the other members have to take care of Kai a lot, especially Suho and Kyungsoo after Baekhyun takes care of him. Still at the end I will say even if they are problematic, they are idols with massive talent. Sometimes it's hard for them to cope with everything they work on. No human is perfect, so no opinion. We fans just take fun from their problematic behaviors that's all. ",

You should look her up, even her visuals look pure. The most problematic for me is Jennie (don\u2019t hate me, I don\u2019t hate her\u2014this is based on how much she\u2019s involved in scandals, issues, etc.) I guess people couldn\u2019t just believe how they actually have a rule on dating, they were just starting out, and here comes the revelation that she is dating Kai. Nothing bad about that, if you think about it. But some take it as if she\u2019s being careless and can get away with things just because she is Jennie. ",
