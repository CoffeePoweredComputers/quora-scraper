            "answer_text": "Layla by derek and the dominoes. There is so much history in it from the band's side and from my side as a teenager when it first played on the radio. It has some of the most passionate playing you'll ever hear in secular music from eric Clapton and duane allman, not to mention the tragedy of duane's death. A girl i once knew as a friend had a 66 Pontiac GTO and we (my friends) would ride around with her on Friday and Saturday nights. She was a beauty and she was an only child, and her dad owned a rice farm, so she got what she wanted, but she wasn't a spoiled brat. Anyway, when layla played on the radio (AM at the time), julie (her name, RIP) she put the pedal to the metal in that GTO. a few years later while i was in the navy, her ex- husband shot her in the back of the head while she was sitting in the car at a club, and some friends of mine witnessed it. The guy is now in prison, but another of my friends who had also been married to her (no judgments, please) went to prison on purpose so that he could kill the guy. Layla. That's the one. ",
