            "answer_text": "For me it's simultaneously the complexity and simplicity of the chord structure. Most \"songs\" use maybe 4 chords for their primary hook. Hotel California uses 8. (7 if you don't include using F# twice) Bm F# A E G D Em F#. Within these chords are several apparent sonic resolutions. The second chord feels as if it's resolving the first. The fourth feels as if it's resolving the third. The sixth feels as if it's resolving the fifth and the eighth, in addition to feeling as if it's resolving the seventh, also resolves all previous 7. This provides more anticipation AND release throughout than most 4 chord structures. Notice the stepping into consecutive fifths. Bm's fifth is F#. A's fifth is E. G's fifth is D. In addition to the audible resolutions there are harmonic overlaps between each set of chords that allow melodies to interplay and travel more freely. Bm and F# share the F# and D notes; which assists in the ostensible resolution. A and E share the E note and provide, between them, a delicate balance of the A-A\u266d and the B and A notes. G and D share the D note and provide a similar delicate balance between the G and F# and the A and G notes. Then Em and F# climb, with the same balance; into an anticipatory climax leading back to the Bm. And all this is before the Latin rhythmic feel even kicks in. This is one chord structure that, for me, never gets old. It's often used in Flamenco music and is sometimes even referred to as the \"Spanish Progression\". For me it captures the mind as well as the heart (but I'm a ridiculous fan of all Latin music). There's enough complexity to make it interesting but not so much as to detract from the emotional quality of it. Then there's the chorus, which flips into the key of D (or the relative major of Bm.) It uses the same chords (minus A and E) but provides a completely different feel. It offers hope where the verses felt hopeless and lost. It provides absolution to the verses' mysterious transgressions. All this set to lyrics that are mischievously esoteric and metaphorical to the point that many various interpretations can be inferred. Everything from the life of excess in Hollywood to the first Satanic Church of California have been put forth as interpretations. I'm not sure what the actual meaning is but that's part of the beauty. People will take from it what they will and given that the music beckons the heart and the mind; both are open to interpret rather than being confined to either an intellectual analysis or an emotional one. For me that's what does it. The absolute simple complexity of the composition. ",

            "answer_text": "It's a masterpiece.  Every element of the song contributes -- even the drum beats at the transition from the intro to the first verse. But I'll just highlight four elements that I think really contributed the most to the song becoming a classic. The Twelve String Guitar Picking in the intro.  This is quite an unusual sound for a pop ballad, so it's an immediate hook. The song would have been great with a six string for the intro, but definitely not as great. The mood created by the Chords and Phrasing. Of course I can't go back and un-learn the lyrics, so I could be projecting back onto the music... But I don't think I am.  The eight chord pattern that is used twice in the intro and then under the verses is really a pattern of four pairs.  The first, second and fourth pairs end with a held note.  The third pair doesn't. Instead, there are extra notes connecting to the fourth pair, and they are stepping down.  To me, all of this evokes feelings of a contemplative journey that turns in the wrong direction. The Lyrics.  The imagery is particularly vivid in the first verse: \"dark desert highway\", \"cool wind\", \"warm smell of colitas\", \"shimmering light\", \"she lit up a candle\".  Then you get \"voices down the corridor\", which is the first hint of darkness -- that the journey is going wrong.  Then comes the first chorus and everything seems fine for a bit, but after that you get the shot across the bow. In one of the best turns of phrase in all of pop music: \"Her mind is Tiffany twisted, she got the Mercedes bends\", right there, the imagery turns from vivid to mysterious and stays that way until the final verse. It finally turns vivid again: \"mirrors on the ceiling\", \"pink champagne on ice\", \"prisoners here, of our own device\", \"steely knives\", \"kill the beast\".  Finally, you get the climactic line, which is both direct and mysterious, and again one of the best turns of phrase in pop music \"we are programmed to receive, you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave\". And last, the Lead Guitars.  Of course everybody talks about the outro twin solos, and they're awesome, but the fills are just as important to the song.  It's more than just the texture and harmonies they add, which are great.  Above, I described the mood as contemplative, and the fills give energy and urgency to that contemplation.  They're as essential as any other part of the song. ",
