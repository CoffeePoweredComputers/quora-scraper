            "answer_text": "There is not a upper class in Ireland. However here are two classes accepted in the population. These are based on negative and positive qualities of individuals. Decent/good class persons are those who exhibit the positive traits and virtues of wisdom,understanding ,fortitude , tolerance and knowledge and try to follow the Golden Rule as good citizens while low class persons are those who irrespective of their personal wealth, financial position, elite education and political affiliations / positions show the less appealing qualities of humanity of pride ,greed ,envy .laziness, lust,intolerance/anger and dishonesty. A Irish adage is as follows; \u201c Put silk stockings on a goat and it still remains a goat\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Ireland is actually pretty homogenous from a class perspective. The line between working class and middle class is becoming increasingly blurred - that\u2019s not to say that there are not areas of extreme poverty and extreme wealth - but generally the bulk of the population all sit somewhere close to the centre. In terms of an upper class, whilst there are still some limited traces of a landed aristocracy from the time of British rule, in practical terms this has all but disappeared. Of course, there is to some degree a ruling class - more so political dynasties and groups of well-connected people. Arguably one of the characteristics of this group is that they all went to expensive private schools such as Gonzaga College in Dublin or Clongowes Wood College in Co. Kildare where they made lifelong connections with other well-connected families. ",
