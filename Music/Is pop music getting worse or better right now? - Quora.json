            "answer_text": "Way worse.   Pop music of the Fifties was Frankie Lane, Les Paul, Percy Faith, Kitty Kallen, Rosemary Clooney, Doris Day, Eddie Fisher, The Everly Brothers, Elvis Presley.   The Sixties gave us Ray Charles, Chubby Checker, Bobby Vinton, Nat King Cole, The Four Tops, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, The Righteous Brothers, James Brown, Otis Redding, The Beach Boys, Marvin Gaye.  The Seventies included Three Dog Night, Rod Stewart, Jerry Reed, The Carpenters, Jim Croce, Barry White, Pink Floyd, Elton John, Simon & Garfunkel, Queen, Aerosmith, The Commodores, The Bee Gees, Donna Summer, Kansas, Cream, Bob Seger.   The Eighties; Blondie, Billy Joel, Kool and the Gang, U2, Kim Carnes, Ann Murray, Survivor, Joan Jett, Rick Springfield, Foreigner, Journey, Men at Work, Def Leppard, Michael Jackson, Prince, Madonna, Guns 'n' Roses, Wham!, Tears for Fears, Chaka Khan, Stevie Wonder, Chicago, Pat Benatar, Tina Turner, INXS, Phil Collins, Whitesnake, Cheap Trick, Miami Sound Machine, Hall & Oates, Bon Jovi, Paula Abdul.   The Nineties; Boyz II Men, Bryan Adams, Mariah Carey, Wilson Philips, Extreme, Dr. Dre, Whitney Houston, Eminem, Cypress Hill, TLC, Dave Matthews Band, Janet Jackson, Sheryl Crow.  .....here's where it starts going downhill.   Late Nineties and the turn of the century give us the Spice Girls, Backstreet Boys, 98\u00b0, Marcy Playground, Puff Daddy, Savage Garden, Sugar Ray, Britney Spears.   Nowadays it's Kanye West (feat. Sylena Johnson or Katy Perry or Jamie Foxx or Lupe Fiasco or Twista, Keyshia Cole and BJ)  or Juvenile (feat. Lil' Wayne) or East Side Boyz (feat. Mystikal and Krazie Bone) or Lil Jon (feat. Three 6 Mafia) or Ying Yang Twins (feat. Lil Jon and the East Side Boyz).    It seems no one can do anything themselves anymore.  Pop music today is comprised of a monochordal riff consisting of a basic scale played on some sort of digital synthesizer, set to a 4/4 time at 120 bpm (thanks to Steve Chall for the correction.) with the bass and vocals so hot you can't hear that there's no other music behind it.  There might be a string swell in there somewhere if you're lucky.  And if it's not hip-hop, and it actually has a chord structure, then 9 times out of 10 it'll be a I-V-vi-IV structure over and over again; whether it's Taylor Swift, One Republic or Maroon 5.  So sad and uncreative.  But then again, it IS pop music;  which caters to what the masses want to hear.  I blame the masses for putting up with it.  If these crappy songs didn't make millions, they wouldn't exist.  The music industry has been allowed to get lazier due to the public not caring about what goes into their ears.   I'm not saying I like all those artists I listed before, but they were top pop artists of their day, and they were good at what they did.  Nowadays.........   hmmmmm.... ",

            "answer_text": "I would say it\u2018s because since the middle of the 90s the development towards a monoculture in sound and production has reached a parity with television advertising and lack of desire for innovation based on fear of less popularity. Rap has also become a major factor with lyrics mainly focused on sex, excess, and competing with other rappers. Since the dawn of technology leading from Techno to EDM the styles of DJ productions are homogenized to a simple blur of dance beats and the occasional repetitive melody. There are still rock bands occasionally singing something more meaningful, but the production makes most of it sound like television commercials regardless. Lately artists with unique voices in the industry tend to be blended out by the blandness of younger artists. yes every era since the 50s has had music that may be considered pretty bad today, but I think that what today\u2019s music lacks are those artists who pushed boundaries in Pop music such as James Brown, Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, Pink Floyd, and some such legends of the 70s. 80s New Wave created a plethora of unique stars, all the way from the B-52\u2018s, Gary Numan, Blondie, up to even Madonna. The whole Synthpop wave was another fresh sound, even early techno in the 90s had it\u2018s moments, although rarely any great lasting songwriting classics. Where are the achievements of songs such as Ben E. King\u00b4s \u201cStand By Me\u2018, or the Eurythmics \u201cSweet Dreams\u201c? Even cover versions were better arranged in the 80s than they are now. The reason why it all seems so bad now is that alternative artists and musical innovation is now happening outside of the mainstream, so you aren\u2019t having the chance to hear it on the radio. Also music videos that were so important to advertising fresh sounds have lost their outlet as the MTV Format has changed and YouTube is the new location for viewing. Hope my answer helps explain this in some way. Music is subjective, but there will still always be some vintage classics to enjoy. ",
