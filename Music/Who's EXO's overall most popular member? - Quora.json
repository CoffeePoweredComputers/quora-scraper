            "answer_text": "Let me break it down for you: Most popular on social media: Chanyeol (he has 13 million followers on Instagram and one of the pictures he uploaded was like the most liked picture by a Korean celebrity in 2017).Most popular in Korea: I hear it's Xiumin, and I've observed this through social media that many Koreans are Xiumin stans. The skincare products that Xiumin was seen using in It's Dangerous Outside the Blankets completely sold out in Korea and even one of those headbands he was wearing was being sought out by people.Most popular in China: It has got to be a tie between Lay and Sehun, even though Lay is an insanely popular celebrity and icon in China, Sehun's fanbases in China are on another level.Most popular in Japan: It is 100% Baekhyun, his merch sold out immediately at the Elyxion in Fukuoka and I read that people were going insane trying to get his picture card.Most popular in the West: I would say Chanyeol and Sehun tie here. I think many international EXO-Ls stan them like crazy.Most popular amongst the 'experts/music critics': By experts I mean vocal experts and critics. Well, Chen's voice has received praises not only by listeners but by individuals who literally study music. I have seen vocal coaches from across the globe reacting with awe to his singing videos, praising his talents and going as far as having his face on their phone covers or wearing his merch.Most popular with the actors: D.O has really broken down the stereotypes that people have about idol actors, his ability to project a number of versatile characters with such sincerity has been widely praised. D.O has won over the hearts of many seasoned Korean movie stars and they're like his own band of supportive 'hyungs' (my all time favorite performance by D.O has got to be in My Annoying Brother, I was so so proud of him and now I'm awaiting the release of Swing Kids).Most popular in Southeast Asia: Kim Jongin aka Kai aka Nini aka Asia's First Love. I think he's really popular in countries like Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines followed closely by Baekhyun. Also, Nini has this duality which I cannot really put into words, he's a star on stage, a shining star. He was born to do this.Most popular idol group leader: Our saviour, our president, the guy whose strength allowed us to move on from what happened in 2014 - EXO's Suho. I'm not saying this as someone who loves EXO but how many bands can comeback even stronger with the kind of year EXO had in 2014? Seriously if it wasn't for Suho, they would have fallen apart.The bottom line is that all members are popular depending on how you view popularity or how you choose to define it. I'd also like to add that the most popular member in my heart is\u2026\u2026Chen as of December, 2017 (my sincerest apologies to Chanyeol, but J.D stole my soul without me even realizing it). ",

            "answer_text": "We\u2019re in 2020 now members are doing things individually you can tell and see clearly who is popular. Baekhyun the most popular without doubt he\u2019s known in kpop industry he is even gaining more popularity until now ..Even in Japan and China he is popular his music on QQ people purchase digital and physical for him. He has fans among exo fanbase and outside the fandom. He has a lot of solo stans who just stan him not the whole exo ,some from other fandoms just stan Baekhyun only. He is really successful as a soloist and as a musician his music charts well and longer too which shows it all not to mention how he sold 1M albums with a mini album and the debut album sold more than 500k surprisingly His magazine covers sells the most even merch or anything sells fast Secondly I think Sechan especially in china too they\u2019re doing well as a subunit too though they don\u2019t chart well but they\u2019re selling well and brand ambassadors too which is good . Most of their fans are exols who support them and put effort for them as well Lay/Yixing is the china king. He carries that title globally he is so popular in China and he is very successful even opened his own company which thousands of people signed up for to be trainees there .his concert tickets sold out in sec and his album solo 1.7M in 7min on QQ which is insane. Then Kai he is popular too he is a model of big brands that speaks more volume . He doesn\u2019t have a big fanbase but he has more support from most people D.O is the next he is an actor and he is very popular in Korea gp which is very great he also have solo stans who support his acting skills. His music charts well and he is doing great Suho is also popular too and most of his fans are exols . His solo did so well Jongdae is digital monster for a reason . His know to be one of the best vocalist in kpop of all the time. He is doing well and even got support for his marriage for the fans Xiumin is popular in Korea if he release his solo I know he will do well ",
