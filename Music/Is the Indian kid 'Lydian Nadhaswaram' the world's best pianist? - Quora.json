            "answer_text": "Not even close, probably never going to be. His interpretations of classical music is extremely ordinary, I don\u2019t even know how someone could compare him with Daniel Barenboim, Murray Perahia, Arthur Rubinstein, Martha Argerich, Pollini, etc. You can only play Flight of the Mumblebee with zero phrasing or articulation so many times before someone figures out you\u2019re overrated and ordinary. And giving him the title \u201cbest pianist\u201d, which doesn\u2019t exist, shows you know absolutely nothing about music. ",
