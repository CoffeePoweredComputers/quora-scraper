            "answer_text": "I know you think that IQ test holds some answer to a question you have, but truthfully, that is not the purpose of an IQ test. IQ tests in public schools are used to identify possible learning disabilities. Obviously, you didn\u2019t have one, or you would have received an IEP and been assisted by special education programs. IQ tests are not used to identify gifted students. IQ tests do not accurately quantify people with extremely high intelligence. I could go into a long explanation of why that is, but I\u2019ll spare you. Do you even understand the history of IQ tests? The first one was done by a French gentleman named Binet. A gentlemen named Goddard translated it from French into English. But you would be shocked why he did that. Goddard is very controversial because he believed that people with low IQs should not be allowed to procreate \u2014 yes, you read that correctly \u2014 he felt that people with low IQs should not be allowed to have children. Today, there are numerous IQ tests that are used for different purposes, but most are used to help diagnose learning disabilities. The most common types of IQ tests are: Stanford-Binet Intelligence ScaleUniversal Nonverbal IntelligenceDifferential Ability ScalesPeabody Individual Achievement TestWechsler Individual Achievement TestWechsler Adult Intelligence ScaleWoodcock Johnson III Tests of Cognitive DisabilitiesUnless you know specifically which of these tests was administered, your IQ score would basically be meaningless to you anyway. IQ testing is just one way to measure someone\u2019s intelligence. You should never rely on them as the sole measure of intelligence. As a teacher, I\u2019ve had a student with an IQ of 135 (which is incredibly high) who couldn't tie his shoes! He certainly could have never succeeded in higher education. I\u2019ve also had a student who barely had an IQ of 70. (An IQ score of 69 indicates the person is developmentally disabled \u2014 what we used to call mentally retarded.) He learned a trade, became a cabinet maker with incredible skills, and makes a 6-figure salary. An IQ is so very misleading. Just by reading your post (unless you had somebody else write it for you) I can tell you are not a person with a low IQ. Your sentence structure, grammar, and train of thought all indicate someone with an average or above average IQ. What more do you need to know? You are \u201call that, and a bag of chips!\u201d You should also know that an IQ test administered when you were in 4th grade (probably 9\u201310 years old) is not indicative of your current IQ. IQ scores fluctuate as children grow and develop. Also, factors like distractions, anxiety, and stress are not taken into account in this scoring system and could drastically affect a child\u2019s performance on any given day. Even more outside of the child\u2019s control, potential administrative errors can also sway what category a child is placed under. Research shows that labels of all types are harmful for children \u2013 and can influence future behavior in drastic ways. IQ tests can be a great way to analyze specific aspects of a child\u2019s intelligence, but they ultimately fail to look at the entire picture. Examinations of intelligence should not be fixed to a one-size-fits-all mentality. They need to consider a child\u2019s overall pattern of strengths, weaknesses, environment, and culture. What may be considered intelligent in one environment, therefore, might not in others. You simply can\u2019t use a number to decide what you are capable of. Things like determination, resilience, adaptability \u2014 these all come into play too, and none of these things are measured on an IQ test. I completely agree with your parents. There would be absolutely no benefit to you knowing the score from an IQ test taken in 4th grade. The negatives however, are huge! If the scores are low, you may give up and stop trying. If the scores are average, you may not try for a more difficult college major (or even for college)) and you would deny yourself some great opportunities, because IQ does not tell your ability to succeed in college or a specific career. If it says you IQ is incredibly high, you may decide you don\u2019t need to bother working hard. None of these is a good outcome. EDIT: Here is an additional response based on your comment, Chuck Larry.  (Source: This graph was adapted from Figure 12 of Hauser, Robert M. 2002. \"Meritocracy, cognitive ability, and the sources of occupational success.\" CDE Working Paper 98-07 (rev). Center for Demography and Ecology, The University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin.) You notice that each of these fields has a RANGE! You mention needing an IQ above 135 to succeed in certain professions. If you look at this chart, you will see that only a very few professions even suggest an IQ above 130, and even those have a range of 95 to 135!!!!!! You don\u2019t have to have an IQ of 135 to do them \u2014 it is a range. And based on your posts and responses, which are very articulate and structurally sound, it is highly unlikely that you have an IQ less than 95. You are just trying to convince yourself that if you don\u2019t have an IQ of at least 135 that you\u2019d be wasting your time trying for a harder profession, and this just isn\u2019t true. A person with an IQ of 95 and ample motivation can be just as successful in those fields. I\u2019m sure this is why your parents are refusing to give you those scores. My advice to you is this \u2014 stop trying to define yourself as a number. You are so much more than that. Based on what you have said, I think you are trying to use your IQ as a cop-out, to avoid even trying for a more difficult major or profession, and you are dis-regarding any information that you feel contradicts your view. You say you are 16 years old. I\u2019ve been a professional educator for longer than you\u2019ve been alive. I know, unequivocally, that having an IQ of less than 135 does not mean that it is pointless to try for any profession. Now yes, if you had an IQ of say 75\u201380, I would say you were wasting your time \u2014 but based on your posts, it is obvious that your intelligence level is more than enough for you to pursue any profession or field you desire.

            "answer_text": "My parents didn\u2019t even tell me I\u2019d taken and IQ test, and I didn\u2019t know. Guess there was enough testing in school (even though it was in the 60s) that it kinda got lost in the mix of tests, as far as I was concerned. But when I was in 7th grade, I somehow found out that there was a minimum IQ score to get into the gifted program I was in, so I asked my mom what it was. She told me, so I knew my score was that or higher. I really pushed her, and I found out that my score was exactly that number\u2014the minimum. Flash forward twenty years. I had done poorly in a couple of college courses, despite normally getting very good grades. I decided I must not be very smart after all. I was seeing a really good therapist, and asked her about getting an IQ test. She gave me one. That score was 18 points LOWER than the one I had gotten in the 60s. This was a really great therapist. She let me continue the test after the time deadlines of various sections (she said she always did that). She said that I did unusually well if given enough time, and that wasn\u2019t measured by the test itself. She said most people didn\u2019t do much better if given more time, but I did. So, it seems it may take me longer but I do end up being smart after all! I probably have some sort of learning disability. So if you do talk your parents into telling you your IQ score, then don\u2019t take it too seriously. I let myself get crushed by my score that I got as an adult, despite what the therapist told me about how well I did if given more time. It wasn\u2019t worth it to get so distraught. My emotional energy would have been better spent on other things. And fwiw, if I were your parents, I wouldn\u2019t have mentioned the IQ score or test to you in the first place. Still, I would tell you at age 16 if you asked. But I\u2019m not your parents. PS - I am the parent of an adult child who\u2019s very successful and graduated summa cum laude from a prestigious design school of an academically distinguished university. She had attended (magnet, if you know what that is) public schools for all 13 years, and I never heard anything about her taking an IQ test, much less what her score was. She doesn\u2019t seem any worse for the wear. ",
