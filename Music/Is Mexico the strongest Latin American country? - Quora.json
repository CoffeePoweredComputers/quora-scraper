            "answer_text": "It depends of what you mean by strong. Talking about the size of their economies (GDP), the biggest one is Brazil, then Mexico, then Argentina, Colombia and Chile. If you talk about GDP per capita, then the strongest would be Panama, then Uruguay, Chile, Costa Rica, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. The difference between this index and total GDP is population, because Brazil is the most populated of them all (around 211 million) and then Mexico (around 130 million). In comparison, the population of Argentina is around 45 million, Chile 20 million, Panama 4 million and Costa Rica 5 million. So, the question is, what is stronger: A country with a big GDP but a medium size income per capita (like Mexico or Brazil), or A country with a medium size GDP and medium size income per capita (like Argentina), or A country with a big income per capita with a medium (Chile) to small GDP (Panama, Costa Rica and Uruguay)? If you want to make your decision harder, consider what kind of goods and services each or the above countries produces, and whether their production goes for inside or outside consumption. ",

If you mean by standard of living Chile, Argentina and Uruguay are first world countries. In this case Brazil is \u201cstronger\u201d because of its size and that's about it. Still a great country tho. Brazilians are nice people. ",
