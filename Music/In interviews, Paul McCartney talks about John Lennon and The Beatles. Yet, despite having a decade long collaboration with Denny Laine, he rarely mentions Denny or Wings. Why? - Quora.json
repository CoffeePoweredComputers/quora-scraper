            "answer_text": "Paul had been friends with Lennon since their teens. Both John and Paul lost their mothers at an early age, both were songwriters, and they were creative partners for 14 years. Each considered the other a brother and creative equal. Paul knew Denny in the 60s when he was an early member of the Moody Blues. Paul HIRED Denny to play in his band in the 70s. So, Laine, like the rest of Wings, were considered by Paul to be more like hired hands\u2014not friends or equals. From what I understand, Paul didn\u2019t pay the rest of Wings very generously. As Wings evolved, Denny was a mainstay, and became something of a go-between from Paul/Linda to the various other members of the band. So, he was useful and familiar, but never considered equal or essential. Also Denny and Paul\u2019s relationship ended in an argument. When Paul was arrested in Japan in 1980, it caused the cancellation of a Wings tour and basically resulted in the end of the band. Paul was tired of the Wings format, shifting lineups, etc. so he pulled the plug and made another solo album, playing all of the instruments himself\u2014McCartney II. The rest of Wings, particularly Laine, were angry at Paul for getting arrested and torpedoing the U.S. tour and band. So, Paul\u2019s relationship with Denny was MUCH different than his with Lennon. Personally and professionally. He and Laine weren\u2019t nearly as close and Paul didn\u2019t consider him so much of a partner, but an employee; and a disgruntled employee at that. Although he and Paul didn\u2019t write many tunes together, one that they did, Mull of Kintyre, is Wings and Paul\u2019s most successful single. Although Laine co-wrote the song, Paul only paid him a flat fee for it. Laine didn\u2019t receive an equal share of the royalties. Something that grated on him for a long-time. Late 1980, Paul told Wings that he didn\u2019t need them for the next album. Laine stayed on to help Paul b/f announcing he was leaving Wings in Apr. 1981. He felt he was underpaid. Denny can still be heard singing backup on Paul\u2019s solo albums Tug of War (\u201882) and Pipes of Peace (\u201883) performing songs that McCartney began recording in 1980. You can understand why Paul doesn\u2019t have the same urge to reminisce about Denny as he does about Lennon and The Beatles. ",

            "answer_text": "The Beatles were his first band and he went through all of their incarnations with them, from the Quarrymen to Johnny and the Moondogs to the Silver Beetles to the Beatles. He grew from a fifteen year old kid to a swinging batchelor and then a 26 something year old husband then father all whilst being one of The Beatles. He and George Harrison had been like brothers since they were preteens. He and John met when he was 15 and John was 16 and became best friends, sharing a bond that may never have been seen before and likely won't again. He and Ringo became friends as he reached adulthood. These three men with manager Brian Epstein, and music producer George Martin were his family. He loved each of them, they loved one another, even as the public thought they hated one another. He never became that close to his Wings bandmates not even Denny Laine. He didn't share the same types of experiences with them so of course he doesn't have much to say. He didn't love them, he might not have even liked them I don't know. Linda of course being the obvious exception.   ",
