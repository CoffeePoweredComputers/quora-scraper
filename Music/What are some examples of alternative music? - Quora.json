            "answer_text": "It kinda depends on what you mean by alternative.  There's Alt-Rock, originally referred to as 'College Radio'.  R.E.M. broke the style open with the song 'Radio Free Europe' from their 1983 release Murmur.   The words used in the the question are 'alternative music'.  Strictly speaking the general term for this kind of music is 'Alternative-Rock', it's a genre.  Alternative music could refer to this genre, but it could also refer to music off the beaten path, something significantly different, something that can't really be placed in any genre.  Captain Beefheart, who worked with Frank Zappa among others, is an example of this approach.  He began recording many years ago and still hasn't been categorized.   To some people, perhaps most people, this is just noise.  But many highly respected musicians, from Lennon and McCartney to members of The Black Keys, really liked this guy.  He passed on in 2010. The Grateful Dead explored music and its potential in an improvisational form as few other bands ever have.  Though their songs on paper are fairly straightforward, you never knew where they might take them live.  Below is an instrumental from their live set Europe '72.  How they arrived at this particular bit of jamming is a difficult process to explain.  But however they arrived, they got there and the result is a beautiful piece of music that defies labels.  Is it rock?  Is it jazz?  I'm not sure what to call it.   In 1972 I saw a triple bill at the Memorial Auditorium in Chattanooga, TN.  The headliner was Humble Pie.  Flash, a forgotten one hit wonder, was also in the lineup.  But the show opened with the band Roxy Music, unknown by anyone in the audience.  For the time alternative was a word you could definitely apply to them.  They pretty much bewildered the crowd with their appearance.  A green Elvis Presley haircut on the sax player, a lead singer who walked a thin line between sleazy and super-cool. Then there was Eno, who slinked around in a sexually ambiguous getup that had everybody guessing.  Most of the audience didn't really get them, but I was totally blown away.  And the thing that blew me away more than anything else was the synthesizer solo in the song below.  I'd never heard its like before, and haven't often since.   ",
