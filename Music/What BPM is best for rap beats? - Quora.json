            "answer_text": "Tempo - Wikipedia Check out this Wiki on Tempo. BPM Is included here as well as other helpful links to help you with this. I don\u2019t think you have to stick between any lines when it comes to BPM for your tracks. Some songs are more aggressive while others are more low key. It\u2019s the beauty of creating. You will notice that not all BPMs that have to do with Rap, or any Genre really are the same. I have seen them all over the board. I think the BPM is more of a helpful tool when you are playing tracks side by side or mixing them. We used to pay attention while making Playlists for our Local Radio Station as well. This is where Beatmatching - Wikipedia skills come in handy. For you, if you do some experimenting, you will get to try so many different patterns that you won\u2019t feel so tied down to just one tempo. This is when you can really explode and begin to create. I think all songs need to be felt out. Some may deserve a slower tempo to accent the Rapper or Vocalist and some may want a more Aggressive tempo to match the message. Where do you want the focus? How do you want the listener to \u201cfeel\u201d as they consume the lyrics as well? Does the timing match the flow of the Lyricist? Tap for Beats Per Minute BPM Here is an online tool to find the BPM if you do not already have one of these handy gadgets in the software you are using. Maybe test a few BPMs with a Track and try Rapping to each one separately. You will know when it feels good. Hopefully this gives you some peace of mind to have Freedom with your work! Don\u2019t be a Sheeple! Be Unique! Good Luck Simply Mary - Musician, Singer/Songwriter ",

            "answer_text": "It all depends on the vibe. BPM is largely based on your energy or the style of the track you\u2019re trying to create. When I make melodic beats centered around piano chord progressions (Rod Wave, Roddy Ricch), they tend to be around 120 BPM. It\u2019s usually easier for me to play the piano at that speed without making mistakes. Once I have a nice loop going with some hard drums, I\u2019ll often speed the track up in Logic to around 160 to give it some more bounce.  If I\u2019m making a boom-bap type beat the BPM will likely be around 70 to 90. I used to make a lot of these types of tracks on the MPC or Maschine back in the day (more recently in Reason and Logic). For me, it was always easier to adjust the swing on drum machines, and the beat\u2019s BPM would largely depend on that. Additionally, if you\u2019re a sample-based producer, your BPM will depend on how you chop and time-stretch your sample. I would also find that my beats would be faster when I came home from the club in my younger days haha. That was back when Atlanta\u2019s trap scene was first taking off and literally exploding onto the airwaves. I remember seeing T.I. at The Compound downtown perform his whole album for ASAP when it first dropped. It was electric! The floor was shaking from all of the bass. There were so many people there that night. People were standing on top of tables because it was so crowded. It felt like the ground was going to cave in.  There was a girl next to me who actually fell off the table she was standing on. She got right back up from the floor, took another shot of what looked like Hennessy, and started dancing again! That\u2019s when I knew the night would epic. I went home and made a dope trap beat around 5 in the morning, and ended up selling it to a local rapper from the Northside a few weeks later. But these days, my beats are a lot slower. Music is pretty much energy anyways, so your track can definitely reflect your mood and vice versa. ",
