            "answer_text": "Who was a better guitarist, John Lennon or Pete Townshend? Neither one of them was really a guitarist to write home about. They were actually pretty similar in some ways, but had different areas of strength within right hand technique, some of them surprising for each. To begin, Pete was an absolute zero as a lead guitarist. He rarely attempted anything in the nature of lead guitar, and it is one of the marked weaknesses of The Who as a group. Lennon was no virtuoso, but at least did some simple leads, notably on \u201cGet Back,\u201d which a lot of Townshend fans would deny if it were not on film. Lennon learned a sort of inside-out alternate-bass fingerpicking in India, and featured it quite a bit on the White Album. But before I grant this one entirely to John, I note that there was a bit of alternate-bass finger-picking here and there on Who albums, like \u201cI\u2019m One\u201d on Quadrophenia, and I have to assume that was Townshend. Townshend had some interesting right hand technique, using a pick, that he showed off mainly on acoustic guitar, some of it surprisingly good. Then again, Lennon had some really surprising right-hand pick technique that significantly boosted the early Beatles, like the fast triplets on multiple strings, in \u201cAll my Loving.\u201d SO I would give John the edge (no pun intended, not Edge), if it stopped there. However, if by \u201cguitarist\u201d you mean a performer, it was John who was able to stand up and belt out a rock tune with a great rock voice, or sing in precise harmony with Paul or Paul and George, while all the time playing a precise rhythm part like the one described. Pete\u2019s voice was adequate at best, and he rarely opened his mouth when Daltrey was around to carry the load. You hear him mainly on his solo albums, and the vocals are not impressive. So as a performer with a guitar, I\u2019m afraid Lennon kicks the shit out of Pete. In live shows, Pete did some acrobatics and tricks with the guitar as a prop, but that really added nothing to the music. But guitar-playing is really not what Lennon is best remembered for. He is known as one of the best and most celebrated pop/rock composers in the history of the form \u2014 his principal rival being McCartney - and he constantly gave proof of an ear and musical imagination that Townshend could not even approach, and no sane person INCLUDING TOWNSHEND would dispute this. While some of Lennon\u2019s most influential creations, like \u201cImagine\u201d were written at the keyboard, he also made interesting use of the guitar in this manner. So if you limit the discussion to Lennon as a \u201cguitar player,\u201d they can at least be compared. But overall, Lennon is a soaring, gigantic figure in music history, and holds a place that Townshend could never aspire to \u2014 not in his wildest dreams, nor the fevered dreams of Who fans that are hopping mad from reading this.
