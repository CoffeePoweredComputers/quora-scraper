            "answer_text": "Im sure youre meaning \u201cWhat do you think WHILE youre listening to music?\u201d and if thats the case, than it's very simple. It all varies on what's on my mind. Some days i have a lot of aggression, so when i listen to certain songs i just imagine myself going on a psychotic rage. Other days if i am sad, i play a little bit more slow songs. And i envision myself doing past memories differently. Music has a power of the mind a lot of the time and can put people in a \u201cdifferent world\u201d temporarily. ",
