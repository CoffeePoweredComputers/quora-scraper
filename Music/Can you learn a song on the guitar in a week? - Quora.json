            "answer_text": "Last year I had to learn ten songs over a weekend. A week to learn a song which was within your playing ability would seem like an extremely long time. If you mean \u2018starting from scratch\u2019, then, yes, you could learn how to play an easy three chord song which you already knew how to sing within a week of starting. You would still sound like a guitarist who had been playing for one week, and there\u2019s nothing that could be done about that, unless you carefully had the song chosen for you and used some tricks (like open tuning). If you want to learn how to play Stairway to Heaven or Romeo and Juliet in a week starting from scratch, and have it sound something like the original, then, I would say, no, these songs are too difficult.

Sometimes I have learned a song, upon hearing it for the first time, before it finished playing. Other songs, I\u2019m still working on and refining after playing them for years. But given a week and proper motivation, I could produce a suitable rendition of about any song. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely, but it depends upon the song. Are we talking about a really simple four-chord song? I can do that in an hour. I learned M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce\u2019s \u201cHome Sweet Home\u201d in about 10 minutes. It only uses six chords, and three of those are different versions of A (A, Amaj7, and A7). Are we talking about an extensive classical etude in which most of the chords involve four notes at once with lots of runs, all run at say 100bpm? That will take a lot longer. Weeks? Then there\u2019s the question of who \u201cyou\u201d are. Me? I\u2019m just an okay player. Not \u201cgreat.\u201d Maybe not even \u201cokay.\u201d You may be better (and thus faster) or worse (and thus slower). ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on the song and your skill level. If you are a beginner, you may be able to find a song with an easy strumming pattern and three or four chords that would only take a day or so to learn. However, if you are looking at a complicated song with many different chords and even a solo as a beginner, it will take months, maybe even a year or more, to learn the song. If you are an intermediate player, you should be able to play a three or four-chord song with no problem, and you should be able to play songs with barre chords easily and even do easier solos. If you are trying to do a very hard song, it may still take a while, though. If you are an advanced player with a lot of experience, it should take almost no time at all for you to learn any of these songs. ",
