            "answer_text": "This requires strengthening your particulars or is muscle (the one that allows you to purse your lips forward of your teeth. It also helps if you work on curling your tongue, since that provides a channel for the air to travel through. Begin by rolling/curling your tongue and then pulling air inward like you are sucking a very thick milkshake through a straw. Then, using the same technique, blow outwards. As you become stronger, raise the middle part of your tongue toward the roof of your mouth and blow faster air by pulling in your abdomen (tummy) as if you were coughing. (Faster air= higher vibration/pitch/notes)  It will take some practicing, but you will soon been whistling like Bing Crosby! ",

            "answer_text": "Just practice! Whistle register is caused by the front part of your vocal cords closing and letting air flow through a small hole in the back of your vocal folds. So simply practicing can ultimately increase your whistling range. But don\u2019t practice too much, if you feel it strains your throat, stop for a few hours, or maybe for a day. ",
