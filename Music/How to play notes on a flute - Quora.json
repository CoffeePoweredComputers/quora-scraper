            "answer_text": "Have you ever blown air across a glass or plastic bottle? It's quite similar to that. The flute embouchure uses lots of cheek muscles that pull the lips (especially the lower) flat back and slightly down in a frowning/grimacing motion. I don't have a picture but there are loads of tutorials on YouTube that can show you what it's supposed to look like. If it is a western classical flute, you will place the mouthpiece in the little nook above your chin and under your lip. If it is a bamboo flute or some other traditional flute without a headplate, then you'll actually place the flute directly on your lip. The exact spot where the flute should sit varies from person to person, I have found, so you'll have to use the next step to figure out which precise position is best for you. Once the flute is in place and your lower lip is tight, start blowing air across the sound hole, not into it. Woodwinds make their sound by passing air over a sharp edge. Most woodwinds use reeds for this, but flutes use the metal edge of the mouthpiece opposite of the lip (or a fipple, in the cases of the whistle/recorder subset of flutes). Use your upper lip to direct the air to do this as needed. Some experimentation is needed to find the correct angle\u2026if adjusting your upper lip isn't working, try rolling the flute toward or away from you while keeping it under your lower lip. Your first attempts will be whistley and airy, but that's perfectly normal. With time you will be able to produce a clear tone every time. However, one should note that bamboo and wood flutes have a much earthier timbre than their plastic and metal cousins, so their tone will not be as \u201cpure\u201d or \u201cclean\u201d, but still beautiful. :) Hope this helps. Happy playing! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi! Well, I don\u2019t think that Quora is the best place to ask this question but I\u2019ll do my best to help you. I\u2019ve been playing flute since I was 7 years old and I remember that at the beginning making it emit any kind of sound was extremely difficult. However, I had a great techaer who taught us some pretty useful techniques in order to help us improve our mouth and tongue positions. First, I suggest you to buy a bag of rice. Now, if you don\u2019t want to clean afterwards, go to your garden or a park and put a grain of uncooked rice on the tip of your tongue. Just like this:  Try now to spit it as far as you can. This will help you position your tongue and lips correctly. After you have done this several times, take only the headjoint and repeat rhe same action as the one you did for spitting the rice\u2026 BINGO! Did you hear that? Your first sound out of many!!! Good luck in this journey. Playing flute is an enriching and wonderful activity and you\u2019ll see how much you can improve in just a couple of months (if you are consistent with your practices). Maybe you can even film yourself every week to record your progress! ",
