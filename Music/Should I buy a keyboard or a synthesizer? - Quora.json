            "answer_text": "Hi, It depends on one\u2019s definition of a keyboard and a synthesizer. In the old days a synth was this:  It did nothing but create strange noises and was almost considered to be laboratory equipment. But to \u201cplay\u201d it you needed a keyboard to go with it like this:  The keyboard would send electrical impulses to the synth to tell it what to play. The modularity of the system meant that one keyboard \u201ccontroller\u201d could be used to control several synths. The concept became popular as it help to standardize they way everything would interconnect. Fast forward to the 21st century and you can get all manner of synths, keyboards and other types of controllers. Some are integrated and are just called synths like this one:  These are great for gigging but less flexible in a studio. For a modular solution you can get whats now called a sound module like this:  See how its just a box without a keyboard? You can also get smaller ones like this:  And they can both be controlled with controllers. Most of the time they are called \u201cmaster keyboards\u201d or \u201ckeyboard controllers\u201d like this:  See how the keys are deep, just like a proper piano? Or you can get this:  This model has lots of pads, buttons, knobs and sliders. Its particularly suited to composing, recording and mixing more modern types of music. It all just depends on your taste. You can even get this:  Its a wind controller, connected to a sound module. You play it in a similar way to a clarinet. Going back to the defenition of keyboard, sometimes people mean this:  They\u2019re fun and meant for \u201chome use\u201d. A more playable version for people that don\u2019t have space for a real piano or the time/money for a synth is this:  Modern home keyboards with full sized keys have impressively realistic sounds. They also have a built in speaker system and \u201cauto accompaniment\u201d (look it up). Note that a \u201cpure\u201d synth would not have all these integrated features. Home keyboards can even connect to sound modules, computers and other equipment. Consider this setup:  The keyboard is connected to the computer. Software records the notes played by the keyboard. You can even get software to act as a \u201cvirtual synth\u201d. This is arguably the most modern and flexible way to get a keyboard to make sound. For someone starting out, my advice would be to get a good home keyboard that has a USB connection. That way you can start playing straight away but enjoy the expand-ability that will take you in any direction you like. Happy synthesizing :) ",
