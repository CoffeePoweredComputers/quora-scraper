            "answer_text": "I would love to rant about this for a solid year but yea Hobi\u2019s personality is definitely a Thing to discuss :) \ud83d\udc9c \u270c\ufe0f \ud83d\ude07  You see according to Army's he's the most happiest member, even if you try to bring him down :)  So his personality is definitely very wise and full of positive emotions\u2026  He's humble af..  And I do think he's the same in reality tho cause it's hard to deny it even watching their videos and in general how the boys interact..  You see this is why Hobi is my second Bias \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc9c  His personality is neverending and he can handle even the most evil person on earth (perfect example being little Brat Jungkook and his fella Park Chim Chim, featuring Taehyung)  Also Hobi is very classy and fine man so there's no need to deny that he has great personality and whatsoever the best manners in BTS in Facct  Also he's always so happy to dance so if you ever meet him just start dancing because I'm pretty sure that's the way he talks with someone :D jk  Also there was this video where BTS got bit drunk on camera and when they were drinking Hobi was all cheerful and fun but when he got tipsy he literally went from 100 to 0 and looked sad af like he didn't wanted to put up with this CrAp anymore :D  But so on he has to be pretty nice personality for real cause I really do think that he shows it very well by what he's doing and making everyone happy :) \ud83d\udc9c \u270c\ufe0f so there you go  Also this Pic hurts my feelings cause Joon is my first Bias \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude2d\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9c\u2764\ufe0f and they both look so fine I would literally jump into the vulcano for them ",

            "answer_text": "Easy answer: No one knows him truly, so it\u2019s hard to know if the personality we or anyone in his life sees is real. I\u2019m sure he has his struggles and his happy days but in the end no one is really able to tell you what he\u2019s like without being around him 24/7. i hear he\u2019s the most different off camera though.
