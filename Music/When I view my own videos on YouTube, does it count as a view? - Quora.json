            "answer_text": "Yes, if you watch your own video, it counts as a view. But, if you do this again and again within a short period of time, YouTube will stop increasing your view count.  If one person watches the same YouTube video twice, does it count it as one or two views? When it comes to watching a YouTube video, it is not enough with clicking for the counter to register our visit, but it is not necessary to watch the entire video. Visits are counted after 5 seconds of playing. If we watch the same video several times, only one view will be counted, because the cookies in our computer or device will consider us the same user. After 30 minutes, the information in the cookie will be erased, a new session will start, and then a new view will be counted. If the same user has watched the same video multiple times and his views did count, the reason could be that he deleted his cookies or he changed browser.

            "answer_text": "When I was just starting out and had only 2 videos and 60 views per video, my friend mocked me and told me I was wasting my time. I replied to him it is very hard to get views and create high quality content and to prove it I challenged (and bet 20\u20ac) him to get higher in view count than me. He accepted. 1 week after he had 1 super crappy video with 800 views. I couldn\u2019t bealive my eyes, while my 2 videos had 150. Luckly it didn\u2019t discourage me so I kept making videos, even better than before. But when I made 3rd video and had totaly 400 views, his 1 video had 1300! I was so pissed. How could a REALLY bad video win so far over my videos (they were mediocrish, I was a beginner then). I surrendered and payed him 20\u20ac. But I kept working on my videos. 2 weeks after I noticed I had a total of 10 comments on my 3 videos with 400 views, and 30 likes and 15 subscribers, while he had 0 subscribers, 0 likes and 0 comments on a 1500 view video. I asked him about that and he didn\u2019t say anything. Next day I beated the crap out of him and returned my 20\u20ac as well as his 20\u20ac. I checked google analitics and I found out he had 1500 total views, but only 1 organic view. Only 1 real person has seen his video, and that was HIM. Turned out that idiot has refreshed the page 1500 times to get 1500 fake views. If you checked audience retention on his video, it was aprox 0,2 seconds. Only possible if you spam that CTR + R. So yeah, refreshing the page screws everything up. ",
