            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t listen to recorded music as a form of entertainment. I make music, or am in part made of it. I suppose I started out weary. I respond to music very deeply, when there is something to respond do. This means commitment on my part. I cannot commit my emotions to something superficial. It has to mean something to me. You might say I treat my ears like sexual organs; I don\u2019t allow just anything into them, especially something that has been hanging around in bars. I don\u2019t judge those who go around with beats in their ears to get through the day; but I don\u2019t consider much of the material to be actual music. That\u2019s fine; humans organize sounds in lots of different ways for many different reasons. My goal is art. For getting through the day, for distraction, for pushing back the boredom: I have other vices. If you have become more chaste about what enters your soul I suspect that\u2019s a good thing. Perhaps you do not plunge into emotional trances because you have grown beyond the material. Music can enter and inform your soul. Maybe you need music that explores deeper and more diverse emotions.

            "answer_text": "Yes,and this isn\u2019t a bad thing just means that you might have found that you like relaxing better.Also,you could just not be feeling that type of song right now.Like listening to a song of heartbreak when you\u2019re having the best day of your life.Or listening to an overly happy song when someone you knew just died.They would feel off to anyone,because if your hormones are having you feel one thing while you\u2019re trying to immerse yourself into a completely different feeling would be like trying to turn on a light switch when the light is out. So,just find a lot of different music to fit a variety of different moods along with some that can fit any mood. Also if none of this is working you could just be going though a dry season for emotion filled music.Don\u2019t worry,everyone has dry seasons for different stuff that they like.It\u2019s natural but be prepared if your music style has just completely changed. Mine did I used to like sad classical music,but then I found a lot of good upbeat music but still enough I can relax while listening to it too. So,Just go with the flow and keep the tunes coming whatever style they might be. ",
