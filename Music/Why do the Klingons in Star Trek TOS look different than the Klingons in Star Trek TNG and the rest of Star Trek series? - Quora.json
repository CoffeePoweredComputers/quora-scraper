            "answer_text": "Why do the Klingons in Star Trek TOS look different than the Klingons in Star Trek TNG and the rest of Star Trek series? There are two reasons, one dealing with reality and the other with the Trek universe. In-universe, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode, \u201cTrials and Tribble-ations\u201d first teased that there was a reason for the change in the Klingon physiology, but as Worf simply responds, \u201cWe don\u2019t speak of it,\u201d when asked about the differences, that\u2019s all it was - a tease. Later, yet earlier, in Star Trek: Enterprise episode \u201cThe Augments\u201d the writers go for a science fiction hat trick, tying together three storylines - from TOS, TNG and DS9- by treksplaining that the supermen of the TOS episode \u201cSpace Seed\u201d were precursors of the augments of ENT who in turn become the basis for Klingon experiments in genetic augmentation which explains the TOS Klingons looking so much like humans. The third connection lies in the name of the scientist who developed and whisked off the augments in ENT: Soong, the ancestor of Data\u2019s creator in TNG, all played \u2014 Soong in ENT, Soong in TNG and Data \u2014 by Brent Spiner. But the explanation in the real world is a lot less convoluted: Make up prosthetics in the 1960\u2019s TV industry could manage fairly good Vulcan ears, but extensive forehead modeling for guest stars and extras, especially for actors who needed to handle stunts in a bar fight just wasn\u2019t going to happen. The transition to more alien-looking Klingons was done when Trek made the jump to movies where hair-styling and darkened skin tones just wasn\u2019t going to cut it if movie Klingons weren\u2019t to come off as cheesy.

            "answer_text": "The Original Series Klingons were created using a very limited budget and, as others have noted, were the best that could be done under the circumstances. Perhaps the worst thing about them was that they were\u2026. sparkly.  The Klingons of The Original Series had sinister facial hair and, at least in some episodes, blackface makeup that made you expect them to burst into \u201cMammy\u201d any second. The material in the Klingon shirts was shimmery, perhaps meant to suggest the martial appearance of chain mail. Since the Klingon Empire was supposed to be militant and dictatorial, perhaps a 1930\u2019s German look might have been more appropriate.  Three Klingon warriors as they would have appeared had the costume designers been sufficiently savvy. Here is the height of 1930\u2019s German fashion. Formidable, eh? The logical conclusion is that the look that would have been ideal for the original Klingons was one that combined the dark facial makeup and the dapper haberdashery of fascism. This look.  The Klingon Captain Koloff as he ought to have appeared; Star Trek\u2019s production team bumbled around and, sadly, never quite got there. When the budgets rose and latex prosthetics became less expensive, Klingons took on the far more convincing look we know and love. One has to wonder - as at least I did at the time - why the franchise felt the need to go back and \u201ctreksplain\u201d the wide difference in the looks. They should have simply acted as though the Original Series Klingons were entirely identical to the Klingons as they appeared from Star Trek: The Motion Picture onward. I think people would have been fine with that. Instead, they came up with the elaborate explanations later put in place. Convincing? About as convincing as Jim Kirk explaining Spock\u2019s ears to an early 20th Century police officer.  \u201cI see you\u2019ve noticed the ears. They\u2019re actually quite easy to explain.\u201d ::crickets:: Leaving the original Klingons identified in-universe with the authenticated Klingons would have presented a difficulty only once: in the Deep Space Nine episode \u2018Trials and Tribble-ations,\u201d when Captain Sisko brought Worf along for the ride into the past and the DS9 team was required to blend in.  One of the most fun Star Trek episodes ever, DS9\u2019s \u201cTrials and Tribble-ations\u201d placed the DS9 officers aboard Station K7 at the time of the Original Series episode, \u201cThe Trouble With Tribbles.\u201d Jadzia Dax (in red) was a knock-out in her mini-skirted uniform, the 1960\u2019s idea of what the future would look like. And yet every difficulty represents an opportunity. What if, the moment the Defiant discovered itself in the past, the camera moved to Worf only to reveal Michael Dorn made up to look like an Original Series Klingon? And nobody seems to notice?  Imagine this man as an Original Series Klingon in a Starfleet uniform - with the Fu Manchu facial hair, patted-on black powder over his otherwise unaltered face, and perhaps the garish gold sash from the first picture at the top of this reply? Perhaps the leer and the insolent manner as well? I take it back - one person seems to notice for a moment - Avery Brooks\u2019 Captain Sisko could have looked straight into the camera for a quick wink, then looked back at whatever he was doing. It would have been Star Trek\u2019s only \u201cbreaking the Fourth Wall\u201d moment, and an epic comedic scene that would have matched the campy tone of the Original Series episode in which the moment was now embedded. Ah, the lost opportunities. Perhaps when Peter Jackson remakes The Original Series, they can do it, as long as he doesn\u2019t outfit all the Klingons in Orc outfits. ",
