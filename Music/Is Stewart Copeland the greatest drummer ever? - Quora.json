            "answer_text": "As said, each one of them is surely good at what he does; to be the greatest is not all; you have to adapt to the singer, bassist and to the guitarist. To play endless solos as some, begins to be relatively easy when you have not other musicians to adapt yourself to. -Stewart Copeland, who learnt drums since his 12 years old, succeeded the difficult 4-years jazz school*. If we set the difficulties scale with 0 for no playing and 100 for classical drums, rock drums school is maybe at 30%, and jazz drums school is at 80%. *By comparison, Andy Summers did the guitar school for 3 years, and Sting sounded first like an amateur. So, no possible comparison with drummers who were educated in the rock school. He had much of his influence from Ginger Baker of \u201cThe Cream\u201d, as you\u2019ll be able to see without difficulty. To maximise the beating does not make the groove, as Copeland notices it, so when you see him playing even in Driven to Tears, he is not even at his maximal potential. Stewart Copeland is to drumming what Mozart is to the classical music: When you do not know much scores of them, you are in the quasi impossibility to anticipate on their play mentally, due to the researches they made in music;when you know different styles of them, you can guess some of their new scores since these are in the logical beauty.Stewart Copeland presents the advantage to know a wide set of drums playings: Jazz of course;Rock where he did his career;He travelled in Africa to know the source of our rhythms origins;He played classical for the remaining of his career.So Stewart Copeland is able to play a wide range of musics, sometimes mixing them - what he is one of the sole drummers to do and to be interested in. He is passionated, and everyone sees this. He knows both the drummer posture of the jazz which he practises often, and the timpanist posture more used in rocks, which he plays sometimes - and can reach the drum on the right with the drummer-handled strip with his left hand, without difficulty.  He pushes on his left strip with the major finger, thank to his tall hands - when most of the drummers can do only with the fourth finger - what let him to beat much powerfully. If required to notice, he figures in the 8th position of a Google search for the best drummers:  , and in the 10th position of Rolling Stones magazine (but I have a big doubt that Charlie Watts figures only 2 places after him, for his fix tchac-boom - tchac-boom). -Stewart Copeland is able to place scientifically purposely shifted rhythms in music during any of his live plays (but he was more fix at the occasion of The Police reunion, surely due to the age) live plays which were always different, renewed by The Police, often overtaking the studio version. -For a good insight of his charleston subtle control: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuFAYAEgKMA , and for the fighter he is, see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c01jjSwX7s \u2014Edit: N. B.: He know also percussions as well, as you can see with the 2007 version of Wrapped around your finger. ",

            "answer_text": "Huge fan of Stewart Copeland and was fortunate to see him play back in the 80\u2019s when he was still full of piss and vinegar. Stewart has always had a unique style that made him stand out, largely due to the variety of musical influences that surrounded him as a kid (dad was a jazz guy, he was a kid in the early rock and roll days, and was surrounded by middle eastern music). That combo, with splash of punk and reggae helped define his style. He is one of MANY great drummers of his era, but comparing him to somebody else (i.e. Neil Peart, John Bonham, etc.) is comparing apples to oranges. He\u2019s probably not the best technical player, or the best metal player, or the best prog rock player. He IS however the best at being Stewart Copeland and the Police would have been a totally different band if somebody else had teamed up with Sting and Andy. ",
