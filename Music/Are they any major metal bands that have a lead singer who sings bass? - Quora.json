            "answer_text": "Two bands come to mind when I think of lead singer who also plays bass Mot\u00f6rhead and Slayer Mot\u00f6rhead has some pretty good songs out there, which don\u2019t tend to have very harsh vocals, and isn\u2019t super fast paced. Lemmy\u2019s voice is just unmistakably recognizable. He also plays bass. May he Rest In Peace. Slayer\u2019s Tom Araya can definitely scream his vocal cords raw, and play bass at the same time. Slayer has many head banging songs, if you\u2019re into the more heavier and faster type of metal. Either way, you can\u2019t go wrong with either band, since they are both good in their respective genres of metal. Hope this helps! ",
