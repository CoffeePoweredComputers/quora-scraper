            "answer_text": "I would like to accept the other answers at face value but being gay, accepting gays in MJ\u2019s day was a career killer. MJ was brought up a jehovah witness which is anti gay. He had career problems over being labeled as effeminate and gay. Other answers say he had mere \u201cdiscomfort\u201d with LGBT persons. Hate might not be a good word but Prejudice or bigot might be a better word. Substitute Michael Jackson \u201chad discomfort with gays\u201d with the words .. \u201cdiscomfort with Latinos\u201d Or \u201cdiscomfort with blacks\u201d etc\u2026 and you will see the prejudice there He had gay fans he did not want to alienate and he had to work with gay dancers, choreographers, directors , so he was never going to own up to how he felt. His friendhip with Arnold Klein proves nothing. Klein was deeply closeted to his patients and celebrity friends, ALL of them , almost until the end. ",

No, and that's only because he was hit on by a gay man who didn't seem to know what the word no meant no matter how polite Michael tried to be, and after that he just didn't like being around them because he was afraid of another incident like that one happening, but even that would never cause him to hate the person.

He was often thought to be gay, and I can imagine his being uncomfortable around a person he wanted to treat kindly, but was afraid would make more bad press for him. This is much like being at a family wedding with your new wife and your former wife. Everyone is uncomfortable, everyone is polite, and we try (at least after some passage of time) to an obviously pretended sociability. ",
