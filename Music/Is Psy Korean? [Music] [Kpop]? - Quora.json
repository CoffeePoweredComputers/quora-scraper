            "answer_text": "His music style is regarded as somewhat original one in South Korea. He is regarded as a creative artist/performancer/performace-director as well. First of all, all songs are composed by himself, and only a few songs are composed cooperatively. Originally the style of his music is hybrid of synthesizer music plus hard rock plus dance music. Hardrock feature is quite apparent in his music. He seems to be affected by Cho PD and DJ DOC in the past. In very early period, he was affected by Cho PD, but from some certain point he left him, and he started to be affected by DJ DOC. About foreign musicians, he seems to be affected by Jean Michel Jarre and Van Halen. Especially about Queen, Psy clearly admitted the influence from the band, especially about the performance style. Perhaps, Andi Roselund will give you good answer, if he is interested in this question. ",
