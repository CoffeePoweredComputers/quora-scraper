            "answer_text": "Yes it is possible. Theasiest way, is as you might guess is with two or more microphones. The easiest way is with condensor mics under the grill and in the bass box. BTW condensor mics should never be put inside the bellows (pressure area) of an accordion. However, some bands like Zydeco bands play very loudly on stage. This can cause problems with feedback in the stage monitors from the mics under the grill. If this is the case, you will need to use non-condensor mics inside the accordion and the separation between the bass and treble side of the accordion will not be as good. ",
