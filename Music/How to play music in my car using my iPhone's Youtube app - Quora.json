            "answer_text": "This may not work as easy as others have suggested. Yes if you have a song playing and connect the earphone output into most cars input. On a Ford you can snyc the phone through the radio. However, it may not buffer all the information as youtube is also trying to transmit video, which is not going to be understood by the radio that is only trying to decipher the music MP-3 and not the MP-4 format being transmitted via the blue tooth interface. Also, when traveling down the highway the MP-4 signal often gets interference. On city streets I rarely have 4g LTE signal with all the bars showing. In your home it is easy to get a good wifi signal, create a list and get your i-pad, i-phone to go through the list and play songs. However, in a mobile car once the signal is lost for 10 - 15 seconds driving under a bridge you would need to re-established a connection to get the song to play. I have at times plugged an i-phone into a mac with garage band and recorded the song. Then after recording you can send the song to i-tunes on the desktop and import as an mp-3 separate file for each song. the quality will be reduced as youtube recordings are not the highest quality. However this is one way to get music you want. ",

            "answer_text": "Easy if you have an aux in jack in your car, just use a 3.5mm jack. If you have an iPhone 7 or above with no headphone jack, use a Bluetooth receiver to an aux jack. If you have a tape deck you can get a cassette adapter with a 3.5mm plug and use either headphone out or a Bluetooth adapter to feed signal. If you only have radio, there are FM transmitters that will broadcast on a clear channel and they usually have a 12 volt power plug and a 3.5mm in port. If needed use a Bluetooth receiver to go wireless from the phone to the FM transmitter. I tried to cover several options if you have an older car with no USB ports, or a receiver. Using what came from the car factory, there are many options to get music from a phone/mp3 player to your speakers without modifying the car. ",

If the system has bluetooth audio support, then you can pair the phone with the audio system and play the music over bluetooth.  But, unless you tell me what kind of car and what kind of audio system do you have, what I said above is just a stab in the dark. ",

You can then turn your phone off, but the music will stop so just tap the home button and hit the little play button that should pop up and then you can listen to youtube music in your car while your phone is off. Good luck! ",
