            "answer_text": "All the answers given so far are very good. Development is a complex process, and it's a comparison with other countries, and I think all the answers here reflect that. Of those who agree that Indonesia is underdeveloped, which I think is correct, there are 2 main streams of reasons: Personal, having to do with Indonesian people's attitudes.Objective, having to do with external factors such as culture, history, politics, and so on.Both have merit, and as someone born in Canada who now calls Indonesia home, let me offer my perspective. The number 1 difference between developed and emerging economies is education. Education has the transformative power to change both personal perspectives and meet objective challenges. By \"education\", I mean more than just training, I mean a liberal education which includes a breadth requirement to learn a little bit about everything. My undergraduate degree required the equivalent of 1 year full time classes outside my majors, in arts and sciences, and in at least 5 different departments. From what I've seen online, Universities in Indonesia have NO Philosophy departments (the most important department of a University in my opinion because the foundations of the academic and intellectual systems, including every science, is philosophy), and very little in the way of liberal arts. From childhood, I was culturally instilled with a strong value in education for education sake, not education for increased economic opportunities. This is one of the major differences between the US and other European based developed countries, and it's also a value which appears to be lacking in developing countries like Indonesia. It's worth noting that a 4 year undergraduate degree in the US is only worth 3 years in Canada and European countries. The personal and objective effects of a liberal education are interrelated, but let's try to consider them independently, objective ones first. Here are some of the major objective effects of a liberal education of the top of my head: All tech countries put major investment into education. Universities hold the majority of patents with the researchers because they fund research. Copying others and making lower quality tech products will ensure that one stays at the bottom of the tech chain. This is the same with manufacturing. South Korea is a great example of an Asian country which invested heavily in education and, in a span of about 20 years, became a leader in quality tech and manufacturing brands.Critical thinking skills, plan-ahead, and logic are learnt methods which help solve problems in any field. Small things like the inconsistency in home light switch installations really annoy me here because they are unnecessarily illogical and show the poor plan-ahead indicative of nearly everything made in Indonesia. Sometimes switches right next to each other are opposite.Educated countries develop industries for standardization in everything from construction, to food quality and health, to selling real estate or even cutting hair. Quality standards are tested and certified. Either by market demand for quality, or government requirements, certifications are required. For whatever reasons, these don't exist yet in Indonesia. Even if it makes the work cheaper, the expense is more in the long run because, say my roof is not built with proper water protection, the cost of repairing leaks later is greater. So this also relates to 2 above. It's just poor plan-ahead.Part of a liberal education is learning how to learn. This relates to 1 in learning how to research and what to do when you face a new problem where research does not help. It also helps create a workforce who can solve problems independently. In my small experience so far, Indonesian workers generally need to be told exactly what to do and how to do it, then they need to be babysat to make sure that they follow through with the work. The expense starts to add up when you have to have multiple layers of supervisors on supervisors on supervisors to get a simple job done. I've somewhat jokingly and somewhat frustratedly remarked on occasion that I'd rather have 1 unsupervised Canadian employee than 10 supervised Indonesians.Part of a liberal education is learning how to teach. Training, or lack of training, is a major problem in all sectors of business here. Even jobs like telephone support and sales are grossly undertrained. Nearly every lower middle class household hires a housekeeper, but how many of them are properly trained? There is an enthusiastic young population of entrepreneurs who are trying hard to figure out how to succeed in business but are in desperate need of good mentoring. A good liberal education has a snowball effect. Those who are able to afford the education, or excel and are granted an education, in turn are able to educate others who, if they are educated how to learn, can in turn educate others. There's an English saying, \"Give a man to fish, and he'll eat for a day. Teach a man to fish, and he's eat for life.\"Part of a liberal education is learning how to communicate and make complex ideas simple. Good communication is the glue of any type of organization. How many Indonesians know, for example, the basic grammar of Bahasa Indonesia? I'm still learning the language myself, so I'm still a beginner and can't really answer this question. When talking to people, I do have a difficult time understanding all the slang. It seems to be used a lot more than in English.With increased education and a more independent and dependable workforce, incomes will go up, which will increase the value of labour in general, and the overall standard of living.Investment in education is the fastest way to increase the development speed, lift the overall GDP of a country, and decrease the gap between the super rich and the super poor.The interrelated subjective effects of a liberal education are just as, and perhaps even more important as Derianto Kusuma argues. A liberal education is more about making good citizens than good employees, managers, or entrepreneurs. A good citizen is a person who takes responsibility to behave in a way which makes a better society. A good citizen knows and respects the law, but is also aware that the intention of the law is to create a better society, and when a law inhibits social growth, it should be questioned and potentially opposed. A good citizen tends to be involved in the political process rather than ignore it or simply criticize it. A good citizen helps others whenever they have the opportunity and ability. A good citizens holds themselves to standards which make a good society, such as honesty, integrity, and hard work. A good citizen doesn't need to be a leader, but if a leader is needed and they are qualified and able, will accept the responsibility of leadership. A good citizen has a heightened sense of ethics, but is respectful of others and their differences. A cashier who knowingly gives a customer the wrong change and pockets the money is not a good citizen as much as a politician who pockets tax money. Someone who asks for or accepts bribes, or otherwise acts outside of the law without justifiable moral grounds, is not a good citizen. Someone who is indifferent to the future of their society, who dumps garbage anywhere or burns it without respect for the environmental consequences for their descendants, is not a good citizen. Someone who doesn't pay their correct taxes is just as bad of a citizen and the corrupt politician who pockets it. To develop, a society needs to create a culture of good citizenship to build essential trust relations to offset corruption and dog-eat-dog capitalism. This starts with a liberal education.Related to 2 above, a liberal education creates both a critical and a constructive mind. It allows a person a person to think independently, solve their own problems, and help others. It helps a person put a problem or issue in a bigger perspective. A systematic mind sees the bigger picture and not just themselves.A liberal education instills confidence and imbues, as Derianto Kusuma puts it, individual empowerment. A poor, marginalized, disenfranchised person can rise to become a leader with this confidence and personal empowerment. This person's feeling of self-worth and happiness is not dependent on the approval of others, but by meeting personal goals and maintaining personal integrity and self-worth.Fulfillment and personal growth in life comes from setting and completing achievable challenges slightly above one's present ability. A liberal education teaches a person what they are capable of and what their limits are. Knowing the difference between \"I don't know\" and \"I can find out\" is essential to personal fulfillment and working within a team.I am not an expert in the history of Indonesia nor its present political space, but here are a few observations of possible contributing factors for the lack of a liberal education. Unlike some other European colonial powers like the British, for some reason, the Dutch were not interested in investing in an educational infrastructure in their colonies. Compare the English colonies in Asia and their present development like Hong Kong, Singapore, and India. It's remarkable that, even after almost 400 years of governance, Dutch is barely a known language in Indonesia and has had relatively little impact on Bahasa Indonesia. Arguably, one of the most valuable commodities a colonial power could have brought was education and an academic infrastructure.Corruption poisons attempts to build an academic infrastructure. On the one hand, corruption reduces the amount of money available for education. On the other hand, if you are rich, you can buy a degree in Indonesia. This second point is one factor in an Indonesian degree not being accepted in developed countries where advanced graduate degrees and specialties much need in Indonesia might be obtained, especially in medicine and hospitals.Politicians have not previously prioritized budgets for education. I understand why gas and electricity are subsidized, especially for the poor, but I would argue that it would be a better 10 year plan to reallocate those funds into education. The current government has said it will prioritize infrastructure, which is also much needed. However, how efficient will the infrastructure development be if it isn't planned by people with the highest levels of education? Again, I would argue that education should be the top priority for any 10 year plan.There is very little social value in education. This is an endemic problem in a relatively uneducated society. How do you convince a generation who hasn't had the opportunities to get an advanced education that education is valuable, especially when the concerns of how to eat and pay today's bills are more pressing and immediate? This needs to start on the government level. Businesses can't be relied on for liberal education because their bottom line is to maximize their profits. A budget which prioritizes education, as argued in 3 above, will also have to market education as cool just as Apple markets its gadgets.There is very little money for government spending because taxes are too low. 10% is way too low for a developed country, and even worse for a developing country, and even worse for a developing country which needs funds to fight corruption. People tend to hate to pay taxes, especially to a government perceived as corrupt. I completely agree with the current government's prioritization of anti-corruption policies and practices. Corruption needs to be removed on every level. But taxes still need to be raised and probably even more so since only a few people pay them and much of the current pool of taxes needs to go to fight corruption! Here are some potential objections and misconceptions to prioritizing education. Increased taxes and decreased subsidies will cause the inflation rate to sky rocket way higher than the growth rate, which will cause the IDR to drop significantly. There will be less spending. While this might be true in the short term, it will show the real level and rate of development, rather than one artificially fabricated by short term policies. It won't take long for incomes to go up, both to offset the increased cost of living and as a reflection of a higher educated and more productive workforce. The price of imports doesn't change, so income will eventually go up to meet the demand for imports. At the same time, a lower currency is better for export because other countries can now buy our products more cheaply, and so it benefits the manufacturing sectors which are sorely lacking in Indonesia compared with countries like South Korea. Lower currency, and a real uninflated one, also makes foreign investments in Indonesia more attractive.There is little correlation between being successful and having a higher education. While this is true on an individual level for the most successful entrepreneurs, it's not true for the average person and a society. People love stories about the high school drop out who made a billion before his peers graduated. It's a sort of underdog story. But it's very rare. Most high school drop outs go on to make very little in hard labour jobs, and due to poor health and a hard life, die younger and less fulfilled.A person learns more valuable life lessons by working when they are younger than by going to school. Both school and work provide valuable lessons, but school will have more benefit to your life if it is done earlier. Plus there is plenty of time for working after school, or even working through school which is what many people have to do to help pay for it.I can't afford it, I don't have time, or I'm too old. Unfortunately, this is a sad reality for most people in a culture which doesn't not already prioritize and fund education. It might be possible to raise funds with the help of family, friends, and even an employer who feels you will be a better asset to their company and have a long loyal career with them. If it is just impossible, or not feasible, you can still support policies and politicians who want to make it possible for future generations. You can save for your own children's educations. This is really why it can take 20 years to develop.Those are my 20,000 Rp, for whatever they are worth! I welcome comments and/or objections. I'm the foreigner here, so really, what do I know!? ",

            "answer_text": "Let's try to break down this question what underdeveloped means ? Some assumptions : Lack of social empowerment (people who not care about things that going on the world)Lack of technological advancement Obvious, seen on the street social problem (poverty, famine, diseases, beggar, etc)Relatively low GDP per capitaanything else ? (you can suggest your edit)If this is what you mean with Underdeveloped I agree with Deri's answer that this is due to the lack of investment in human capital.  To have technological advancement, modern society, and higher GDP you need to change from Primary sector of the economy to Secondary sector of the economy to Tertiary sector of the economy to Quaternary sector of the economy. In short we must move from agricultural civilization to manufacturing civilization to service civilization to information civilization. In another words, we must move from : First phase : Society that taking something directly from natureSecond phase :Manufacturing to finished goodsThird phase : Give better service better convenienceFourth phase : focusing in knowledge, information and creativity To be able to conduct this you need an educated population.Now let's move deeper shall we?  How come this, lack of investment in education happen? WE LIVE AN AMBIGUOUS SYSTEM WHERE EDUCATION DOESN'T LEAD TO BETTER LIFEFull Stop.  Let's answer this yes / no question :  Does education directly lead better life in Indonesia ? Does a smart, wise and educated person in Indonesia have better living quality compared to other people ? If you answer NO, for both questions, then this is the reason why Indonesians doesn't invest in education. There is no apparent connection that education leads to better life, at least in Indonesia. How this related ? Let's go deeper shall we ?    1. Human are practical being  Investing = the action to invest your asset  for bigger gain in the future Investment in education will be pursued and demanded by the citizens IF we can ENSURE that investment in education will bring bigger gain in the future.  In Singapore to become a minister of high official ranking government officials, you had to get a government scholarship. If you didn't get this scholarship it will be almost impossible to be a high raking government officials. This is their glass ceiling, an unwritten rules but the rules apply. This is how they say to their citizens that \"Singapore is a country based on meritocracy. Either you had to study hard, live in rules, or you will never be someone in this country.\" In Indonesia, this doesn't happen. There is no connection about being educated and living a better life 2. The first point of a nation is stability  Machiavelli \"It is better to be feared than to be loved\" In 1500s Machiavelli write that it is better for a nation to be feared than to be loved, this is in some part true.The first thing that a nation have is a stability, you cannot make a lean nation where you can adjust your market and your team and search for your customer. For a nation a stability is the first requirements, and one way to get stability is to get power. How to get Power in Indonesia? Let's think about this, an archipelago, with maybe hundreds of kingdom, and no single ruler, how come Dutch colonized Indonesia?  The truth is maybe Dutch never really colonized Indonesia, instead Dutch makes agreement with the prince and the kings, the aristocrats to rule Indonesia together. This is how the Dutch get their power in Indonesia, by making agreement with Indonesian noble.This is also how Indonesia New Order defend Indonesia stability, with the right connection with the powerful.  3. It is every human wish to give better advantages to their descendants (children) While education is more or less a level playing field (no matter your parents are professors, Ph.D, or  someone who never finish high school, you need to study yourself to be someone educated), human in the nature want to give better advantages to their children. Now how to give better advantages to your children? Through inheritance of power, if in the past, the king does this directly using the system (the prince directly become the new king), now we use politics, network, and money. Powerful Indonesian family try to use this to ensure a better life for their children, and at least in Indonesia they are quite successful. This is why in Indonesia maybe whose child you are or who you know matter more compared to how educated and smart you are.  It is our system. 4. Indonesia, where \"the strong survives\" You lie! No, that is not our system. We live in a democratic meritocratic nation! Aren't we? Are you sure ? Let's take an example of law field. Usually law field is quite straight, you need to knows the rules, you need to argue wisely and convincingly. It is one of the field that attract the best talent in US. However, in Indonesia, the field of law is a contest of power and network. Which side have the biggest cash, which side have the better connection, which side have more force (can gather more mass). In Indonesia you even can say that Supreme Court is false ( I need to remind you that Supreme Court is as sacred as President, telling that Supreme Court is wrong maybe similar to saying that we must change our flag). Indonesia system = a games of power ?   Four points above leads me to conclusion that :  Indonesia society run as a Game of Power, where maybe a play of politic, who you know and which family you are born to matter more than how smart and educated are you. Or in Deri's word : Indonesian society is such that education plays relatively little role in one's economic advancement. Which implies that the cause of lack of investment in human capital in Indonesia is actually incentive problem.  Worse, in nation scale!  Even thought Indonesia perceive themselves as a democratic and meritocratic country, the truth is Indonesia is a country where the power reside in few and meritocracy is a fiction. This is also the reason why some of Indonesian whose able to study abroad in the end maybe prefer to work abroad instead in Indonesia, because foreign country system favor meritocracy. At Indonesia conception Soekarno & Soeharto, decide that to make a nation out of this archipelago, we need to cooperate with all person or group who held some power. What they forgot is to design a clear rules about how an ordinary nobody who happen to born in this person can be someone in this country. Is it through : Education ?Religion ? Financial ?Network & relationship ?Instead what we have is a mirage of democracy and meritocracy. But the world (Indonesia) isn't such a bad place, even thought education is a skill someone had to have, in the opposite side, maybe some networking and relationship skills will help in life and business too, and maybe Indonesian are quite skillful in these. I think other countries amazed at how often we have small talks between each other.   Btw, if you think :\"You have written all of this!! In some parts I agree with you, but this is so difficult and abstract, this cannot help my life. Why you write this and what can we do after we read this??!!\" Yes, in some ways you are right, but there are two reasons why I had to write this : 1. One important trait of aristocracy is to be undetected and unnoticed, Otherwise ordinary people will revolt and protest to get the same rights. This is the most important reason why I write this. I believe if all Indonesian at least know something about this, than our aristocracy will have no choice and have to change.  2. Urgency to design a better system I have been thinking a lot, about what makes a country a good country, what is the purposes of a country in our modern life (in the past the first purpose is of course to defend a territory and ensure stability, however with modern life, this purposes become obsolete and ineffective), how a country can learn from a company to ensure better life to their citizens, and what actually is a better life? I believe that at the basic a nation is more or less similar to a company, an organization which have certain purposes and consists of a lot of part. The problem is like in a company, or in other organization, sometimes the organization purposes becomes blur, this make the organization ineffective and corrupt. One aspect of social studies is to discuss about what a good governance is, about what makes a country good, which government we should chose, some country chose communism, some country chose democracy, some chose freedom of speech, some others maybe more inclined stability or meritocracy. All of this are good, so what aspect that makes a good governance ?  It comes from the people, come from the citizen (this way you don't need to enforce your idealism like what Hitler does) [1]Have clear responsibility system (reward and punishment), if some part of the system is corrupt and inefficient, how we should punish it and who should punish it.Gives people hope (we need to make it cleat that some nobody from a disadvantaged background can work to make his way to get a better life) [2]Focus on the future or next generation (Like a start up who focus on long term investment, I believe that this is the way of nature, spending time planting and nurturing seeds to get a fruit for food in the future)We are not fighting alone, globalization and technology make it easier force us to demand a change of the system, even thought Indonesian market is huge, to penetrate world market we need better education, if your network can help you import an item and sell it in Indonesia, your network maybe wouldn't work in the world competition, where you know nobody. In the world competition most of the time you need to built the best product and let your product speak for itself. Therefore we need to change the system, and this will favor meritocracy in the future.     Additional notes :The inspiration for point [1] & [2] comes from Jim Collins series books, some points that come from the books are  : Clock building is more important than time telling (perceive our identity maybe as Land of Freedom is more important than setting goals like to have food self sufficiency)A great company doesn't mean it is great for everybody, but it means that it is great for certain people (Singapore maybe aren't good for people who are a rebel and doesn't like to follow the rules, but it is still a great places for a lot of people)Leadership will perish when the leader gone, in the meantime a strong identity and culture will survive even after the founder of the company die (for example Hitler or Soekarno, they have great leadership, but their idealism doesn't survive after they die)It is more important to put your best people in the field with the biggest opportunity (even thought it only contribute to 1% of your revenue) instead put him in the field with the most challenge and problem (even thought this is where you get 99% of your revenue at the moment), I think Jim Collins write a story about Philip Morris regarding this issue.Solving a lot of problem doesn't make you great, achieve to penetrate into bigger thing is what make you great (also resonate with Auren Hoffman's answer to What advice would you give yourself 10 years ago?) Notes :Wheeww, this is my longest answer, I never write this long before.However, so far this is also the most interesting answer for me personally, I hope you have a good time reading it. ",
