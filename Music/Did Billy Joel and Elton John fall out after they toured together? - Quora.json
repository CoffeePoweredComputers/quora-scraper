            "answer_text": "I am fans of both artists, but I am more familiar with Elton John than Billy Joel. First of all, Billy Joel and Elton John, while having similar styles/acts, are very different people with very different personalities. This does not mean they cannot be friends. But it does make for an interesting relationship. I do not believe that either of these two performers are actively \u201cmad\u201d or \u201cupset\u201d with the other. Elton John is very driven and thinks nothing of booking a 300 date world tour in any given year. Billy Joel tours, but seems to be more laid back about the process. Elton has continued to put out new albums (the most recent being in 2016), while Billy stopped after his 1993 River of Dreams album. One point of disagreement between these two friends has been why Billy has not been making new albums. Billy has stated repeatedly over the years that he stopped writing songs and making albums when he felt he reached a peak - he also has said he never liked the song writing process. Billy wrote both the lyrics and music for his songs, while Elton writes only the music. Elton can write a song in minutes (literally), while it probably takes much longer for Billy. Elton continues to feel that Billy should put out some new material. I also seem to remember about 8 - 9 years ago when there was (supposed to be) a Face to Face Tour with Elton and Billy. From what I recall, Elton wanted to do \u201cx\u201d number of dates, and was all set on his end, e.g. his agent, manager, etc. Billy, however, had never agreed to do the dates (or even the tour). Back at this time, Elton was probably disappointed - and upset (and knowing Elton probably mad as hell). As for Billy at the time, he was dealing with some personal issues, and I believe he was in dire need of having both of his hips replaced. Billy mentioned at one point that he did some shows where he could barely walk on stage. Billy differs from Elton in that he has said recently that he is tired of doing the same show over and over. Elton, however, can seem to do show after show after show. Of course, set list tweaks and some level of improv, but from my experience of having seen multiple Elton shows live from the same tour: It\u2019s pretty much the same show. Elton was also critical of Billy\u2019s rehab. He felt it was to \u201clight\u201d when compared to his rehab back in 1990. However, all that being the case, when Billy Joel recently played Madison Square Garden he performed Elton\u2019s Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, and as Billy put it, \u201cTipped his hat to [Elton John].\u201d So to really answer the question, I don\u2019t believe they have fallen out. Friends and contemporaries can and do disagree, even argue, and get upset. But that does not take away from the underlying friendship. They probably will never tour together again, but given Elton\u2019s intended retirement that was probably not going to happen anyway. ",

I've personally seen them together as part of at least three different joint tours, and I believe there have been a couple of others that did not make their way to the city I was living in at the time. They speak of each other with affection and respect, and it\u2019s hard for me to believe that they could have toured together so often or spoken so highly of one another if they had fallen out. ",
