            "answer_text": "The emo rap sound will go the way of the emo rock of the late 2000s, it will be seen as uncool and people who came of age in the mid-late 2010s will start poking fun at who they were during that period, but whether it will be essentially reevaluated and cool to listen to go again by the end of the decade is another question. But as the 2020s go on, it will increasingly be viewed as a cringy thing you listened to in high school.Rock music might make a sudden comeback in a way nobody expected, defying commonly-held beliefs about the incompatibility of the genre with modern music culture. This new rock band/movement won\u2019t cater to the boomers\u2019 idea of a traditional band, therefore making old people hate rock once again and the genre interesting in the mainstream once more. These rock bands might form an alliance with existing rock-influenced rappers (if the new rock movement doesn\u2019t somehow overtake hip-hop) and those rock-influenced rappers might drift away from rap towards rock in the process\u2026Post Malone will potentially go rock/metal completely. These rock bands might speak/make music about current issues and therefore reach an even wider audience. Several of rock\u2019s offshoots will also undergo a mainstream renaissance while new ones are made in the process, and rap-influenced rock music (not the 90s style but a modern take on it) will prevail instead of rock-influenced rap.The trap sound will see a rapid decline and be viewed as extremely beaten to death.Electronic music will obviously continue, but it won\u2019t sound like anything like what\u2019s happened in the 2010s.The idea of \u2018genreless\u2019 music will either be taken to it\u2019s extreme, or seen as a realistically impossible concept that was only going to be explored for the sake of it and fade away.",

            "answer_text": "I think music will continue to become more electronically infused and unfortunately, I think the music will become more homogenized than ever before.  What Jim Morrison predicted has come true and I think will only continue to become truer. Technological advancement has had an adverse effect on the quality and depth of music.  Consider the above. Music has steadily become more homogenized since 1982 and this is primarily because: 1. Music is more accessible than ever before. 2. The Music Industry has focused on promoting and keeping trends than promoting diversity in music. Why should the music become inventive and why should artists risk their careers being creative when they know they can release a basic remix of a song with different lyrics and it can go to number 1. I don\u2019t even really like Rap and Hip Hop, but I will admit that the differences between Biggie Smalls and Lil Pump is night and day. Here are the partial lyrics Lil Pump Gucci Gang: Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gangGucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang!)Spend ten racks on a new chainMy bitch love do cocaine, oohI fuck a bitch, I forgot her nameI can't buy a bitch no wedding ringRather go and buy BalmainsGucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang!)Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gangGucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang!)Spend ten racks on a new chainMy bitch love do cocaine, oohI fuck a bitch, I forgot her name, yeahI can't buy no bitch no wedding ringRather go and buy Balmains, ayeGucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang Compare that to Biggie\u2019s Juicy It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazineSalt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousineHangin' pictures on my wallEvery Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley MarlI let my tape rock 'til my tape poppedSmokin' weed in Bambu, sippin' on Private StockWay back, when I had the red and black lumberjack\nWith the hat to matchRemember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha\nYou never thought that hip-hop would take it this farNow I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tightTime to get paid, blow up like the World TradeBorn sinner, the opposite of a winnerRemember when I used to eat sardines for dinnerPeace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri\nFunkmaster Flex, Lovebug StarskiI'm blowin' up like you thought I wouldCall the crib, same number, same hood, it's all goodAnd if you don't know, now you know, nigga As I said before, I\u2019m not really big into rap and hip hop, but it is evident to me that Biggie\u2019s music had a message to it. Depth, real. It takes no intellect to listen to Lil Pump, and that is the problem. I think music in 2020s will continue to decline and become more homogenized. Honestly, in 2029, Lil Pump\u2019s Gucci Gang might actually be good. ",
