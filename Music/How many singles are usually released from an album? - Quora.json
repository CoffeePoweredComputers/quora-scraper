            "answer_text": "The whole concept of \"singles\" has become a bit meaningless in the digital music era.    Record companies can still choose to promote, or suggest to stations, particular songs from an album.  However the way this is generally done today is to release the lead single before the album, in some cases, and increasingly, significantly before (the title single to Robin Thicke's Blurred Lines album was released over 3 months before the album itself).   In other cases albums have been released bit-by-bit to iTunes or other outlets (as \"countdowns\" or similar).  But when users can choose to download nearly any song from any album individually, the term \"single\" in the old sense of an individual song that can be purchased (possibly with a bonus b-side or other additional content) becomes moot.    Going back to the pre-digital era, while an early release of a single was not unheard of it was not typical and singles seldom preceded the host album by more than a week or two.    Going back even before that to the pre-album era, singles were the main channel for releasing music; albums came about as an additional way to market the same material -- after the songs were popular an album with 2 or 3 singles plus \"filler\" would be marketed.  In this case singles can't be considered to have been \"released from the album\".  (This is largely true in the US; in the UK album and single releases were independent and less likely to overlap).    But, during the album, cassette, and CD eras, singles were typically \"released\" concurrent with or after the host album.   Any pop-rock album typically debuted with a \"lead single\" identified - typically the most catchy, widely-accessible song on the album.  Subsequent singles would be released with the intention of keeping the artist \"on the charts\" and on the radio as long as possible, constantly boosting sales of the albums and any accompanying live tour.    The art was in the sequencing and timing of the singles releases.   Releasing songs that sounded too similar back-to-back might cause listeners to get tired of the artist sooner, but going too far afield from expectations might also backfire.    As to the original question, the number of singles released is limited only by the number of qualifying songs and the appetite of the audience.   Record companies are happy to keep releasing singles as long as they chart, and keep the album in the public ear.   (Often the last single released charts poorly or not at all and defines the stopping point).  Typically three charting singles was considered a very strong showing for a pop-rock album; exceptional albums had double this.   The record for hit singles from an album is jointly held by Michael Jackson's Thriller, Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation, and Bruce Springsteen's Born in the USA, each of which spawned seven top-10 hit singles.   This page on Rate Your Music gives a full list of albums hosting four or more top-10 singles.   Note that in nearly every case more singles than the numbers shown here were released from these albums, not all making the top 10 (For instance, all but one of the ten tracks on MJ's Bad album were released as singles but \"only\" six of those made the top 10).

            "answer_text": "It depends on the album - how much songs it has, how well it is selling, and so on. Almost always atleast one single is released before an album. Nowadays, it isn\u2019t uncommon for two singles to be released before an album. Sometimes, as much as three or more singles are released before an album (e.g Purpose by Justin Bieber, Witness by Katy Perry). Songs released as lead singles are usually to showcase how the era of the singers music will be. When an album is released, it typically has atleast 1\u20133 songs become singles, thought often enough, as much as 4\u20135 singles can succeed an album. It depends on how well the album is selling, or what plans the singer may have. A lot albums have a maximum of 4\u20136 singles overall, but sometimes it can be more, reaching as much as 9 singles (e.g Sasha Fierce by Beyonc\u00e9, Bad by Michael Jackson). Songs released as singles are usually released as singles due to how much they can be predicted to become popular, like what could be a good dance anthem or how the song stands out in comparision to other songs on the album. Bonus tracks are rarely released as singles, but they sometimes are (e.g Super Bass from the deluxe edition of Pink Friday, La La La (Brazil 2014) from the deluxe edition of Shakira, if you count that as a single). Typically, singles aren\u2019t released with too little time apart, usually a few weeks or a month or two. Sometimes, the duration of abums and their singles could span nearly 2 years (e.g 1989 by Taylor Swift, 18 Months by Calvin Harris). TL; DR: It depends on the album, but typically about 3\u20135 songs from albums are released as singles, but it varies from album to album. ",
