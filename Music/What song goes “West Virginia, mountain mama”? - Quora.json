            "answer_text": "\u201cCountry Road\" John Denver He was big in the 70's with several TOP 10 songs, that the whole country could, and did, sing along to. I believe a couple were number 1. A huge deal in those days. He had a short-lived TV variety show but had success as an actor, hitting it big starring in the film, \u201cGod\u201d , opposite the legendary George Burns as God. Huge hit. It's actually a good movie. They had good chemistry. Critics liked it, and his performance in this box office hit. \u201cGod 2\u2032 , the sequel didnt quite measure up. He was a talented guy. KISS was more my thing then. Elementary school days. But , you couldn't escape John Denver. He was everywhere. His life came to a young, tragic and sad end when the plane he was flying (he was also a pilot) flew straight into the side of a mountain on a sunny and clear Colorado afternoon. I believe he was in his 40's. (Answering your question by memory- no research). Not sure if it was ruled a suicide, but as I recall, his wife seemed to think it was, as she shed some light on his personal struggles. He was a victim Depression. He drank heavily to self-medicate. I remember reading this in the paper as a kid- Surprised. Trademark big smile, likeable, all American guy with these uplifting (maybe corny some of them but..) songs. Wholesome. \u201cThank God I'm a Country Boy!\u201d his huge hit played everywhere. He was also highly regarded as a musician- acoustic guitar. And THAT'S !..you're in-depth answer. ",
