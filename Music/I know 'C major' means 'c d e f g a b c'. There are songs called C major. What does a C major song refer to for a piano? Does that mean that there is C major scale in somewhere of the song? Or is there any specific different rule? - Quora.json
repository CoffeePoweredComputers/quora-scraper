            "answer_text": "There are no specific rules about how music is made - the only real \"rule\" is that the one making the song should enjoy it!  (Schools make rules, so teaching will not be chaos - but after the lessons, musicians apply the rules either as they please or in obedience to their own cultural styles, or - usually - both). First:  the \"key\" of a song means a tone that one feels as the center, about which the higher or lower notes are wound.  Sing a little of a familiar song.  now sing the same song, but higher.  You have just sung in a \"higher key.\"  The KEY is the tonal center, the most significant tone. A \"scale\" (c d e f g a b c', or some other) is a set of tones that are used most frequently in a song.  The tones may be used in whatever order, and as many times, as the song-maker chooses.  Typically, the scale \"c d e f g a b c\", which is a \"Major\" scale, is used in happy songs.  The Christmas carol \"Joy to the World\", begins with a Major scale going down (c' b a g f e d c).  A more wistful kind of tune (the Minor scale) may be made in the key of C by lowering the third tone and sixth tone (E and A) a little = C D e-flat F G a-flat, and so on).  You can make a Middle-Eastern tune by lowering the second tone ( C D-flat E F G ) from the major scale.  There are many other patterns available!  Each gives a different emotional effect.   The name which covers types of scales is called a \"mode.\"  There are Maor and Minor modes, and dozens of others, some folk-traditional, some invented by musicians.  Most European/American tunes are either Major or Minor; Assyrian music is almost all minor or Near-Eastern.  Traditional Oriental music and American Appalachian music (odd pair!) uses a five-tone scale (C D E G A).  The five make up the physically strongest connection in the ear, and are often prominent in folk music, jazz and other simple ethnic types of music.   The piano keyboard is designed so that ANY tune may be played in ANY key level - this is done by making each successive key, counting the black keys, an equal increment of tone higher.  The musician then learns the patterns of black and white keys that can make a scale sound right.  \"Joy to the World\" can be played in the Key of D Major - I will use the symbol # for \"sharp\", the black key just to the right of a white key bearing the letter name.  Here it is: D C# B A G F# E D.  If you can play this, or have someone play it for you, you will hear that it sounds just like the version in C Major, just a little higher.   It is an amazing system, and very versatile.    Originally keyboards and harps did not have \"black keys\".  They were tuned in a popular scale to whatever their society preferred.  A musician could alter the emotional effect by centering the tune about a different tone than the usual.  This would produce, effectively, a different mode (if you can play a simple tune on the piano starting with C, try the same pattern on just white keys starting on some other note, and you will hear the difference. The piano only captures the APPROXIMATE pitch (high and lowness) level of tones that are used in songs.  Some cultures, notably the African ones that eventually became mixed into blues and jazz, have tones that would be \"in between\" some of the piano keys!  People from those cultures, introduced to Western-style pianos, would go back and forth, above and below, ultimately inventing a new style of music to accommodate the impossibility of representing their traditional music in the way they had hoped.   It is far easier to get a tone out of a piano than out of a horn or stringed instrument - so keyboard instruments have become enormously popular.  But they have one drawback - they can only play the twelve tones (C C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# and B), whereas a singer can sound all the pitches in between.  Just slide your voice up and down like a siren.  There!  You have just made a melody a piano can not reproduce!  So the piano has had the effect of dividing any music it touches into these twelve \"tone compartments\", but singers, violin players, trombonists and guitarists can make many more. I likely have answered much more than you expected, London!  But I have organized it in a fashion that makes sense, though if you do not play a keyboard you may want to find a friend who does and discuss this with him or her.  I wish you well, and please comment if you need explanation! ",

            "answer_text": "A song in C Major means that the C Major chord (CEG) will be the final chord of the song. When the music arrives at that chord it will feel like it is the end, especially after 4, 8, 12 or 16 bars of music. The song will also mostly use white notes. Black notes are allowed for interest, but do not have any harmonic importance.  The main chords which will appear in the harmony of a C major song are C, G and F. Between them they use all 7 notes of the C major scale and they are known as the Primary Triads of C Major. They are the only major chords which can be made from the C scale. Secondary chords are A minor, D minor and E minor, and these are the only minor chords which can be made from C scale notes. The B chord (BDF) is diminished and sounds a bit strange, but can be useful. Think of the C Major scale like a pallette of colours that look good together. C is the most predominant colour in the picture. When you use a different key, such as A Major or B Flat Minor, the notes and chords will change accordingly. ",
