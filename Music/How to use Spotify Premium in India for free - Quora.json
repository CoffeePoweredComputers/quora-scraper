            "answer_text": "Honestly, there's no free way to use a service but there's a huge discount if you go to the purchase menu. Apart from that you don't actually need Spotify for a ton of reasons in India. 1st reason is the absurd pricing where every song can be nowadays listened and downloaded for free almost anywhere without any hassle. If you're an Indian, you're wasting your money on Spotify unless you're the talk of the town who would purchase anything for showoff. Spotify doesn't give value for money in India. ",
