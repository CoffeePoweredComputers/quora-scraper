            "answer_text": "Hello, and thank you for this question. Greatness is not an absolute attribute of music. Greatness is determined by CONSENSUS, by a growing general agreement of the power, depth, and expressiveness of music, whether a single composition or the entire lifework of one composer. To ask \u201cwho is the greatest early music composer?\u201d is to invite many opinions. A large number of music historians and early music performers, however, regard Josquin des Prez as \u201cgreatest\u201d among a whole long list of truly wonderful Renaissance composers including Pierre de la Rue, Johannes Ockeghem, and Jacob Obrecht among others. Palestrina\u2019s position (he was living two or three generations after Josquin) over time has fallen in general opinion, as there are many \u201cgreat\u201d composers working in Europe as contemporaries of Palestrina, including Adrian Willaert, Cipriano de Rore, Carlo Gesualdo and Orlando di Lasso among others. Early music can mean a variety of things, of course. \u201cEarly\u201d can mean anything from 12/13th c. Notre-Dame polyphonists Leonin and Perotin all the way through the Baroque and JS Bach/GF Handel. Generally however, Early music means the late medieval period starting with Guillaume de Machaut and Francesco Landini all the way through to the early music of Monteverdi, about a 300-year span from roughly 1300 to 1600. In that period another luminary, the composer Guillaume Du Fay, also lived and produced an impressive amount of late-Medieval/early Renaissance music. Some prefer Du Fay to Josquin, in fact. However Josquin\u2019s music tends to resemble later post-Renaissance music with its luscious harmonies and soaring, expressive melodies. Du Fay\u2019s music, with a few exceptions, is more medieval sounding, though his Missa Se la face ay pale is wonderfully melodious and harmonious. Du Fay\u2019s chansons are delightful. Much Du Fay is more medieval sounding, using fixed forms and isorhythms, a process that goes back to Machaut, Philippe de Vitry and even earlier in the 13th century. So this has been a very exhaustive (and exhausting) reply to your question. I hope it will spur you to investigate these wonderful composers, who have enriched countless lives including mine! All of the above composers have been generously recorded on CDs and many can be heard streaming on Amazon Music for free. Good listening! ",

            "answer_text": "Who is the greatest early music composer? This question made me think: what makes a composer \u201cgreat\u201d? I think there are several factors. Popularity. When large audiences seek out the music of a particular composer, there must be something special about it that speaks to the human soul.Influence. Composers\u2019 music lives on, and if you hear its echoes in the compositions of generations of later composers, that\u2019s evidence of greatness.Originality. This one goes along with the last. Originality for its own sake might just be seen as eccentricity, but if it alters the future of music and sends it off in new directions, that\u2019s a sign of greatness.Personality. The best composers speak with a distinctive voice, a style that makes them instantly recognisable. That is evidence that their music comes from the heart and is not artificial, derivative or formulaic.Consistency. There are hundreds of one-hit wonders. I can think of individual pieces that make me sit up and listen, but we require more from a composer than a couple of purple passages to list them as great. Great composers write a lot of great music.Our own taste. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, no composer is great if you personally are not bowled over by at least a few things they have written. Taste, and consequently our assessment of what\u2019s great, is subjective.To my taste, then, as well as on all the other criteria, JS Bach rules, if you wish to classify his as \u201cearly music\u201d. If not, then we need to go back to Palestrina, Monteverdi, Gesualdo and a dozen others. The choice will be personal. Those are my three nominations. ",
