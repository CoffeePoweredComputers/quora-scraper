            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not racist to have a preference. I\u2019m black so I know a bit about my community. The funny thing is, a lot of black people don\u2019t like Afro hair. There\u2019s been a shift in recent days but I know many black women who much prefer Brazilian or Indian hair on their heads and many black men who agree. That\u2019s not racist in and of itself. However, keeping in mind the historical, social, and psychological effects of racism I would like every person who sees kinky Afro hair and recoils, to question themselves. Whether you\u2019re black or white, you should try and question it. Why don\u2019t you like it? Is it a real, natural preference? Is it because it\u2019s something you don\u2019t see often? Could it be the fact that for a long time, Afro hair was socially unacceptable. Because it grows on the heads of black people, it was ugly. Because up until recently and still today, black hair is seen as unkempt and inappropriate in a professional environment. Do you know if any of this influences you? Whenever people ask if something is racist I implore them to look deep down and think about these things. I don\u2019t believe that it is racist to have a preference. I prefer Afro hair because it is what I am accustomed to. Perhaps a white person would feel the same about their own hair. None of these are racist. What might be racist is disliking the things that racists, for centuries, have been telling us to dislike. And on a final note, having a few racist tendencies does not a racist make. I think everyone has a few biases and beliefs that are not kosher. So long as you don\u2019t act upon them, it\u2019s generally fine. I wouldn\u2019t suggest going around and saying you don\u2019t like Afro hair though. I wouldn\u2019t go around saying I don\u2019t like straight hair because it\u2019s probably a little insulting. Be respectful. ",

            "answer_text": "My youngest son\u2019s friends, with types 3 and 4 hair, smell so much better after playing outside than my son. He has that medium-blonde, straight, stringy, white kid hair that smells (and sometimes looks) like a wet dog after exercise in the heat. Nothing I can do about it - just a genetic thing - but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m racist against small sweaty white boys just because I think they smell like wet dogs. Similarly, if someone didn\u2019t like very curly hair, that\u2019s their thing. Just don\u2019t be insulting people about it. ",
