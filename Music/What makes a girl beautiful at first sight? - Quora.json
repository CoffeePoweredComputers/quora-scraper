            "answer_text": "Beautiful. It's a powerful word!! It's a word that holds power and prestige far beyond that of any other adjective. It's a sacred word, one kept for those who truly can't be described any other way. It's a word that chases women to plastic surgery and extreme diets. It's the base of all women's desires and lifelong struggles. But isn't beautiful about so much more than looks? Isn't it in that extra thing \u2014 that thing that makes a woman beautiful instead of hot?People who have \u201cbeautiful\u201d exteriors can begin to look ugly after you get to know them, while someone with a somewhat \u201caverage\u201d face can become the most beautiful person you know, proving that beauty isn't just a fa\u00e7ade, but an iridescent quality that is not solely dependent on one's gene pool. It might be the girl you don't notice at first, the one who doesn't always stand out. It's the girl you need to get to know, whose beauty becomes more defined with every conversation, every glance. It's a word that describes women who can't be classified as just hot. Her passion defines her more   \u200b\u200bThere is nothing more beautiful than a woman with passion. A girl who gets excited about things, lives for things and holds things close to her heart is a girl worth knowing.She's the girl you'd rather talk to in bed than take to bed. Because passion is contagious and watching someone get excited about something is the most beautiful quality you can find in someone.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------She shows you her real face  \u200b\u200b\u200bWomen have the right to wear makeup and there is nothing wrong with that. However, a beautiful woman doesn't feel the need to hide behind it.A beautiful woman does not do anything for anyone but herself, whether that means wearing makeup or going barefaced to work, she makes sure you know that she does not owe her looks to you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------She doesn't chase the limelight  \u200b\u200b\u200bA beautiful woman doesn't fight for the limelight, but is naturally endowed it. The allure of the beautiful woman is that she does not need to work hard or fight for attention.She is confident and humble, which usually presents a mysterious quality that attracts people more than outlandish gestures and cries for attention. She doesn't take away from others or place her worth on how many people she's talking to.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------She knows how to talk  \u200b\u200bThere's nothing worse than a woman who doesn't know how to use her mouth. A woman who knows how to speak her mind intelligently, who can captivate you with her words and opinions proves that there is nothing more beautiful than intelligence. Smart is sexy and words have the power to turn any girl into the woman of your dreams.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------She can go it alone  \u200b\u200b\u200bA woman who doesn't need a man is a woman who is confident \u2014 and confidence is the key to real beauty. A woman who doesn't need the approval of others radiates with a security and poise that elevates her from the status of just another hot face.Because being a woman isn't about needing a man, and a beautiful woman understands that she, herself, is enough. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------She's open  \u200b\u200b\u200bBeautiful women do not limit themselves. They are open to new ideas, places and people. They do not shy away from things because of stigmas and fear, they are beautiful in their boldness and their open minds.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------She's got soul  \u200b\u200b\u200bThere is such a thing as people with ugly souls and we've all met at least one person who proves it. A beautiful woman radiates not because of her tinted moisturizer or glossy hair, but because of that something inside her that just makes you want to be near her.Hot girls don't need to you show you their souls, beautiful women attract you with theirs.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------She's got that thing   You know that thing, it's the thing you just can't place. It's something that you can't put into words, let alone describe to your friends.It's the special something about her that you can't place because you've never seen it before. It's the defining quality of the beautiful woman, the thing no one can ever completely describe. Source:http://elitedaily.comPictures: Google ",

So...back to what gets me to go WOW... Her titsHer tight shaped assHer legsHe face. She's cuteThe clothes she wears that compliment her curvesHer curls flowing hairThat's what I see first so that's what's gong to get me to say \"wow.\" Her curves, the way she looks. That's attraction. Not love,. Not me knowing her personality. I haven't a James Boind devise telling me what her personality is or history about her. All I see, is her ass, tits, curves and cute face, legs in the beginning.  Now if I like what I see - I will approach. But if she's a snotty drama queen, acting like she's it, has no social skills, acting really playing hard to get then I WILL walk away. I won't be interested. I don't care how attractive she is. It is all gone, blah. Gone. It turns me off. That's the same online too. If she doesn't answer my message, after she added me, after she followed, acts like she's it, playing hard to get...bye, bye.  I'm not interested no matter if she's attractive.  What will get me to ask her out is... She's confidentShe's not intimated for me to approachShe smiles and conversesShe flirts and good at itShe's adventureous and I'll know by asking a question and she answersShe's decisiveHer personality is smiling, bubbly, kind, compassionate.These, when I talk to her, if I find these I'll ask her out. If I don't, I'll say it was great talking with you and I move on. It's not enough for me because when dating, these are important for me. These are qualifiers for me. This is when I look deep inside the woman. So first attraction. If all is well when we talk. Then I ask her out.  But if you don't want the truth.. It is the way she brushes her hair away.  How she looks clean. How she looks so determined. How she looks smart and elegant. Like she is going somewhere in life. Her flowing curls and her cute face. ;) ",

            "answer_text": "Question asked: What makes a girl beautiful at first sight? Well, I read the answers and found that mostly segmented on basis of physical attributes. And, you folks are right that within first sight you can just assume on basis of appearance. Some said that eyes of the girl could help someone to decide whether she is beautiful or not. But, if a guy who is like me who rarely look in the eyes of strangers and most of time busy with his own thoughts, then the task supposed to be difficult. So, what I do? I rarely pay attention on someone's look. Because it doesn't matter what person wearing, how looking, with whom walking and so on. Because its their choice and their convenience.  So, one day I was travelling in a crowded bus from Noida Sec-62 to South-Ex-1. I was  just holding the bar and standing as there were no seats and whatever seat I managed to get, offered to the needy ones. And, she caught my eyes. A young lady probably 23-24 years old. She just managed to stand in between the seat. Then, after a stop the seat in front of her emptied and with my amazement she didn't sit and offered that seat to an old lady. Throughout the journey, I found that she just offered the seat to others and not thought about her comfort. In fact, a girl was vomiting and she offered her something and tried to divert her mind through random talks. Then, my stop came and I deboarded the bus.  So, she is the beautiful girl in that bus from my perspective! Why? A bus which is filled with dozens of girls and ladies but everyone thinking about own comfort and fighting for seat, she voluntarily offering her seat to needy one. So, she is beautiful by her soul. I didn't remember her face but I remember her act.  So, a person who think for others and choose others comfort over own, then that person is beautiful for me.  Everyday I come across many faces and I hardly remember all but I remember some for their good deeds. They are beautiful.  So, what's your attitude towards others decide whether you are truly beautiful or not. And, if you observe, you will able to find someone's attitude towards others. Their small acts will just tell you what their attitude is.  Many can catch your eyes but very few will catch your mind!  ",

            "answer_text": "Well let me tell you my personal experience. I am currently pursuing engineering at Jadavpur University . During the freshers in our college, I almost collided with a girl. She was dressed in a white dress. I was apologetic but she said its OK. Then she smiled at me. Believe that was the most beautiful smile I had ever seen. It almost had a bewitching effect on me. She was my junior my friends told me. Many of my friends did not find her beautiful at all. Yet I was almost captivated. People say that beauty is in the eyes of the observer. I have never heard of a statement truer. Sometimes I feel  that God must have spent his entire vacation designing her. Her smile,her little eyes, her grace everything fits so beautifully in a casing. If God was DaVinci she would be her MonaLisa. My friends always say that me  feeling the way I do makes no difference to her so I must stop admiring her. Yet she is just a treat for the eyes .Everyday I see her dressed in different attires ,yet there is no attire that can beautify her any further.  I think there is no fixed formula which makes a woman beautiful. Yet there is something that beats all permutations and combinations. Something divine. Its like asking what makes a beautiful poetry so elevating.Its like asking what so divine about a painting.  A woman is nothing but a three dimensional divine sculpture. The sheer sight of her  makes my day. Normally I am a guy brimming with self confidence yet when I try talking to her I cannot dare go beyond a \"hi\" or a casual \"hello\".  I can go and on talking about her yet I wont be able to explain. All metaphors fail when I try describing her. If I am ever able to talk to her or If I ever get to know  it would be great. But even if I am never able to do that her memories will be etched in my conscience for eternity. P.S: I am writing what I might never be able to tell her in person.   ",

            "answer_text": "Let me describe what makes a girl beautiful at first sight through quotes, The beauty of a woman must be seen from in her eyes, because that is the doorway to her heart, the place where love resides.  - Audrey Hepburn  The spark in her eyes captivates the heart. The looks and the charm makes a girl attractive but It's the eyes which makes her look beautiful. Especially, how she sees with it. Expressive eyes wins the heart and drops the jaw.  \u201cFor attractive lips, speak words of kindness. For lovely eyes, seek out the good in people. For a slim figure, share your food with the hungry. For beautiful hair, let a child run his fingers through it once a day. For poise, walk with the knowledge you\u2019ll never walk alone.\" If someone is doing above things then no matter what, that girl is beautiful.  It is not only the looks, it is her acts which actually makes her look beautiful.  \u201cThere is nothing more rare, nor more beautiful, than a woman being unapologetically herself; comfortable in her perfect imperfection. To me, that is the true essence of beauty.\u201d  The girl doesn't have to be perfect or model like. If she is comfortable with herself then the beauty will radiate like a moon in the dark night. Nothing else is needed than her confidence and the way she carries herself. The lips will mumble \"Wow....\" inadvertently.  \u201cTo him she seemed so beautiful, so seductive, so different from ordinary people, that he could not understand why no one was as disturbed as he by the clicking of her heels on the paving stones, why no one else's heart was wild with the breeze stirred by the sighs of her veils, why everyone did not go mad with the movements of her braid, the flight of her hands, the gold of her laughter. He had not missed a single one of her gestures, not one of the indications of her character, but he did not dare approach her for fear of destroying the spell.\u201d  Sometimes, approaching the girl breaks the spell. Just have to see it to believe it. It can be in an airport, coffee shop, park etc. There are moments in which the girl mesmerizes with her natural beauty.  Her short smile, Her cute stares, her laughing at trivial things, her karate kicks on air when she thinks no one around her, Her nonchalant gesture to help someone etc. Each and everything she does naturally becomes beautiful, pretty, gorgeous and adorable.  Girls of all kinds can be beautiful \u2013 from the thin, plus-sized, short, very tall, ebony to porcelain-skinned; the quirky, clumsy, shy, outgoing and all in between. It\u2019s not easy though because many people still put beauty into a confining, narrow box\u2026Think outside of the box\u2026 Beauty is not restricted. The more the braids waft with the breeze, the more her subtle beauty shines. Beauty is everything. All girls are beautiful, Only for some the hearts are ugly.  Finally, To the girls out there, People often say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and I say that the most liberating thing about beauty is realizing you are the beholder. - Salma Hayek  Thanks for a2a Pradeepta Yadu  ",

            "answer_text": "I am amassed by the variety of answers given for this question. My 20 cents will be about the visual frames of a (mostly unknown) girl's reaction that makes her beautiful. Tucking hair behind ears.This could be any girl and beware, this won't last more than few seconds. She is most probably engaged in some conversation or writing something while subconsciously her manicured fingers goes up to her falling hair and tuck them behind her ears. That's the moment. Your eyes themselves will give out the \"WoW' without even asking the brain. Eventually when the visual signals reach your brain, it will be confused as to which one concentrate on, her thinking eyes,  her curling lips or the nails combing through her hair.   Smug:Smug associates with two reactions. Self satisfied achievement or a flirt. Both are beautiful on a girl.   Determination:No one likes an agitated girl. But a girl who is calm, composed and determined? That's a sight to behold. That \"Say what you wanna say. I am gonna do what I am gonna do!\" attitude is definitely the most beautiful thing in a girl if you have the eyes to observe.  The 'I am Gonna Beat You' frame:You are having a casual chat among your friends and you just pulled this girl's leg (metaphorically). Replay her actions from that instant. Her eyes will widen followed by a smirk in her lips. Then realizing that your comment is on her the smirk will widen into an open mouth while her hand coming up to cover it. Midway she will realize the mischief monger and divert her hands to hit you. Now you pull yourself sideways to avoid the hit looking back at her face. That's the moment. A little shy, a little smile, a little joy of recognition and a little piercing eyes threatening you.  The Side Looking Frame:Either laughing over a friend's comment or made a startling realization. The way a girl's eyes roll sideways while her face is still straight. This one.   Reading Girl:An intensely reading girl is definitely a beauty in herself.   Gossip frame:The one thing boys envy of girls. We guys can't gossip and get fun out of it as effectively as you guys. And by the way, Did I tell you you girls make the scene beautiful as well?  Shy Girl:I guess this should to to the top. A shy girl her with head tilted down while her eyes trying to look up. Call it shy, flirt, happy reluctance or just an joyous smile. Anything fits in this classic frame. IMHO Indian girls score better in this frame.   There are many other visual frames where a girl looks beautiful. These are just the prominent few. ",

Story of how I met a gorgeous girl. I was in a subway joint.  Sitting across me, on the roadside table was this girl.  She was having a sub, chit chatting with her friend.  My gaze stopped at her. *let's see what made my gaze stop at this unknown girl* She was so fair, with those golden tresses. Most probably colored but so neatly done.  In the shimmering street light she looked like a sunflower doing a late hour.She was simple.  No make up.  I could see the scar above her left eye.  It must have a great story.  She didn't seem to mind the face scar.  I liked that confidence.*when she got up to get a lemon tea* Woah!  She is short!  She sits up so upright that seems tall!  No bending over, taking support.  Sitting straight and pretty.I saw her walking till the table.  She walked up-straight, chest out shoulders broad.  Not in a lousy usual manner you see around.  Her head was high and I loved the way she carried herself, instantly.All these points were enough for me to gather up guts to go and talk to her. Bonus read:  I was taking a parcel too, when I was inside.  I overheard her refusing for polybag.  She carried the parcel in her usual bag!  Brownie points!! Thanks for the A2A.  :) ",

Let me explain a bit, if I look at a very pretty girl but she is grumpy or showing arrogance, I will feel guilty to have thought \u201cwow\u2026\u201d. And it will simply be a \u201cwow\u201d. On the other side, take 2 normal / random girls during a night in a pub. A lot of men must have experienced this: you approach the group, one of the girl (usually the one you want) is smiling, enthusiastic and asking questions. The other one is waiting 2 minutes and then ask you to leave in a very rude way. This second grumpy moody girl is often the one that will ask \u201cAhh when I go out men never talk to me, it\u2019s always with for my friend, what can I do to be as successful?\u201d. Erk. I often answer that she has to observe her friend, look at how her friend is open to the world, smiling and positive.She has to observe herself as well and realise that what she projects to other is often the opposite. So, to resume, I can\u2019t remember how many time I look, look back at a girl passing by or standing on the other side of a place thinking \u201c wow..shes quite beautiful\u201d, when I see a girl smiling, social and interesting. As if there were positive and pleasant waves emanating from her and touching everyone around.And that\u2019s how I surprised myself many time, realising that those girls are often not the prettiest! But people will remember them more than the prettiest\u2026 In the end everything is about personality and open minded. ",

            "answer_text": "According to me Beauty is Relative. When it comes to beauty i think we must be familiar with the term Relativity. A person may look beautiful to someone and the same may not attract the other. I think every living being carries an Aura around him/her. When we look at a person we get a particular internal feeling about him/her and our brain starts a thousands of quick calculations which ultimately results in liking or disliking of that particular person. I think this Aura can be altered with our change of looks, dressing, makeup, walk, appearance, talk, smile and even with time. When a particular person whether a guy or a girl comes in front of us in some particular getup which gives that person a particular Aura; Now If we somehow like that aura then we think he/she is beautiful otherwise we don't. I think not even beauty but also many other things depends on our Aura. Whether we will be comfortable with a person or not, whether we will talk to a person or not and many other feelings depends on this Aura of ours. Every person perceives this Aura in a different way. A particular Aura may attract a person and the same may averse another. So, in conclusion i think Beauty is Mystified and Relative. And we must be comfortable with ourselfs and our looks because that only will generate our true Aura ( which will be active maximum time). And that true Aura will attract a perfect person towards us automatically, who will love us for who we are. ",

            "answer_text": "Coming from someone who is very picky! The very first thing I look at is how pretty she is; the combination of face and hair.  This is closely followed by her figure; if someone is either too fat or too skinny my attention soon wanders.  After that it's things like how she behaves, how she talks, how intelligent she is...  OK, it sounds very superficial, I know, however... Having said all that, there's a big difference between physical beauty, which is something that most of us can agree on, and personal beauty, which is a combination of 1,001 intangibles which go to make the girl's personality and how she responds to, and interacts with, me.  It even includes how I unconsciously respond to her genetic make-up, the information about which is carried by her pheromones.  We can all get to know girls who are far from our mental image of beauty, yet we sometimes find ourselves attracted to them, and on a far deeper level this is the kind of beauty which should be paramount in lasting relationships.   Now if you can combine that with physical beauty, you're on to a winner :-) ",

            "answer_text": "Our brain perceives the charm a.k.a beautiful in human-beings primarily by comparing it how much the face satisfies the Golden Ratio.I will use a succession of golden ratios to create a golden ruler to understand design in the face:  The head forms a golden rectangle with the eyes at its midpoint. The mouth and nose are each placed at golden sections of the distance between the eyes and the bottom of the chin. The beauty unfolds as you look further.  Even when viewed from the side, the human head illustrates the Divine Proportion.The first golden section (blue) from the front of the head defines the position of the ear opening. The successive golden sections define the neck (yellow), the back of the eye (green) and the front of the eye and back of the nose and mouth (magenta).  The dimensions of the face from top to bottom also exhibit the Divine Proportion, in the positions of the eye brow (blue), nose (yellow) and mouth (green and magenta).   The golden ratio face calculator grid:You get an actual measure of golden ratio proportion and beauty using the golden ratio face calculator that is included in PhiMatrix golden ratio design software   The ear reflects the shape of a Fibonacci spiral :     Even the dimensions of our teeth are based on phi :   For more information: Measuring Facial Perfection - The Golden Ratio - Oprah.comhttp://www.phimatrix.com/face-beauty-golden-ratio/ ",

But when you finally know her as well and then you've got that her attitude not as well as her face/body you just understanding that beautiful is not about just face/body. It is about a pretty heart,brain,and attitude. But like i say at the first that every girl is beautiful. Back to what you ask in my opinion a beautiful girl is someone you've met at the first time but just feeling you've knew her for along time ago because she is really beautiful.she is always smile , she is always spread love and a little good things but you just like omg she's so perfect.even when she's not. That girl will really attracted for other girls to be her friend and for boys to be her girlfriend. That's my opinion . ",

So, I become conscious and a bit uncomfortable when I talk to them. But this makes me eligible to answer this question. Whenever I had any sort of interaction where I found girls to be confident, not authoritative or loud; humble, no-non sense and hygiene conscious, i find them beautiful. There are other factors as well but i would say these were the common traits. And it has nothing to do what they wear. In another instance, we had a DIDI - she is still there and happily married. She was elder sister of our friend. And she was DIDI to all. Every boy of our friend circle respects her to the core. She was the topper of the class and currently well established in her life. She has all these traits too. But, it was not due to her being a \u2018topper\u2019, it merely shows that she is good at what she does. It was due to her innocence. She was confident, competitive but still has that air of innocence. Innocent to all the such factors defined by society that divide human beings. So innocence, to me, enhances the beauty of their conduct, and make you respect them. ",

So what makes a girl beautiful at first sight for me? First the physical appearance. Clean, feminine clothes- not too loose, not too tight, not too long, not too short. A cute face, with threaded eyebrows, free flowing lustrous hair, and a smile that plays out often. Add to that a well-maintained body, with manicured, painted nails. Then the demeanor- Not arrogant, but confident. A bit of coyness makes a girl look cute as well. She would behave politely with everyone deserving of it. A woman who is secure in her skin, and comfortable with her self. If there's an example of such a girl, it would be Gayatri Joshi from Swades.  (Image not from the movie)  ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A Dr. Pradeepta Yadu   Oh. Great this question is bit tricky because what I believe is every person has their own criteria to define beauty and  as what I believe is no girl can be beautiful for all and no  girl ugly for all.  It totally depends upon  people to people to define beauty.    Beauty lies in the eyes of a beholder. I mean it. According to me - What makes girl beautiful - I sum up my answer in few points. 1-Her simplicity- This is what I  a first notice in any girl. 2- The way she carries herself- Carry that suits not just because of the show-off. 3- Her Smile- Smile make girls more adorable. 4- Her Confidence. 5 -Her sense of Style. 6- Her hair. 7- Her eyes. 8- Her body. 9- Her voice tone. 10- Sence of humor. 11- I find the girl more cute and beautiful when she wear  spectacle.(Something wrong with me i know) 12- What she is doing at that moment - apart from all these things if she is helping needy people then I don't think all above matters to me this quality is enough to make any girl more beautiful.

Chronological way: Her simplicity Look at these. These are best examples of simplicity:    Her dressingSome thing which attracts first after look, obviously is the dressing sense. I admire this attire most:    Her eyes:This is one part of your body which speaks a lot. I bet if anybody denies eye's top contribution in summarizing girl's beauty    Her Feet:This is my personal view. Can you stop looking at her feet, if it is this?     Apart from their attire and beautiful body, something extra which attracts my attention are as follows:      Thank you ",

When i was something like 13yo, a horny boy has i recall it, i would look to girls starting on their legs and ending on their head. What do you want? We are stupid and young :| It wouldn\u2019t mather very much how she looks, if there was something to grab, she would automatically be pretty and beautiful. Nowadays, it\u2019s quite the opposite (i\u2019m almost 20yo). The first thing that i notice is the eyes, then the smile and last the cheeks. It\u2019s quite clich\u00e9 i know xD but it\u2019s the truth :) The moment you randomly look them in the eyes and smile to them, and they smile you back, for me, it\u2019s what makes them beautiful at first sight.

            "answer_text": "Wow , it depends for me.  1. Her eyes attract guy at most of the times. The perfect kajal , the eye colour , not too heavy makeup on eyes , all this just adds to the beauty of the girl and eyes are the first thing we can notice and incidently harm free ;) 2. Her smile , as said a smile can cure broken hearts , a smile can attract a guy directly to her and even start a conversation. 3. Overall body looks are also important. Not too thin/slim , not too chubby/healthy . I am not saying I want a perfect figure , but it should hold any type of attire , a party dress or a traditional sari or a normal kurti 4. The aura the girl has around herself attarcts guys as it defines is she a bimbo or a smart girl with brains. Just 5 mins with the girl and we can understand it. Well these are just a few but important factors for me.  Hope I was useful !! ",
