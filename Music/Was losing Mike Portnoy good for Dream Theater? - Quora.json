            "answer_text": "Obviously personal opinion here, from a long-time fan (since 1993). Good for the band? No. Good for MP? Absolutely. I really think that the band lost some spark when MP walked away. He had been a true driving force for the entire existence of the band. He was the one that curated and released the archives (the demos, live stuff, etc.) and he made sure that the live sets were unique each and every night. Since he left, we got an album where JP basically wrote the drum parts, one really good album, and then an overblown concept from JP that was basically the JP/JR show; The Astonishing is the only tour I\u2019ve skipped, simply because I couldn\u2019t stand the ending to the story (they called off a war because the daughter was killed? really? that\u2019s not a reason! if anything, that\u2019s *why* people go to war. maybe I just didn\u2019t get it, though). I pre-ordered the new album, but still haven\u2019t gotten it from Amazon (still in for the super-deluxe edition, three albums in a row now; I have high hopes for this one). MP, though. Since he left DT, I\u2019ve lost count of all the projects he has participated in. Adrenaline Mob, The Winery Dogs, Transatlantic, Twisted Sister, Shattered Fortress, Sons of Apollo, Flying Colors, The Neal Morse Band, PSMS, Metal Allegiance\u2026 Those are just the ones off the top of my head and I\u2019m probably missing at least a couple. I think he has to be one of the busiest guys in the industry; Constant Motion, indeed. Leaving his band and his friends may have been the hardest decision of his life, and I know I miss him in DT, but it was probably the best thing he could have done for himself. ",
