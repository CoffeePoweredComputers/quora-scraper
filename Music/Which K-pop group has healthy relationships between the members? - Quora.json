Disclaimer: all of this is speculation, we don\u2019t really know which groups have good relationships or not. These will just be a few of the groups I think have really good relationships. ITZY- from all the ITZY videos and interactions I\u2019ve seen, I think they have a very fun but close relationship. They joke a lot with each other which shows that they are comfortable with each other. I don\u2019t know a lot about ITZY but from what I\u2019ve seen, their relationship is quite good.TXT- TXT\u2019s relationship seemed a little bit withdrawn at first, but by now they seem very comfortable with each other. I really love their relationship, they have like sibling mixed with best friend energy. They play around a lot but also seem like they would talk about important stuff with each other if they needed to.Stray Kids- Stray Kids seem to have a very very fun and happy relationship. They all seem to have a lot of fun together. They all kind of get drawn out of their shells when they\u2019re together.Those were just some of the groups I thought of. I\u2019m sure there are many more, these are just some of the groups I know pretty well.  Here\u2019s a Stray Kids photo for your enjoyment. ",

            "answer_text": "I'll answer with Super Junior. All the members are close to each other, even their families. Having a show attended by families, hang out together, they really show that they're good. They said their relationship was only because of contract (I like how savage are Heechul and Ryeowook when they said this), but in fact they're like a family. They've suffered so many things together, even when they stated they\u2019re a bit awkward with some member but they shared a strong bond to stay together. I think it's natural to have members fight with each other, because it's what families do. They actually maintain a good relationship not only between the active members, but also the non-active members, they still close to each other. If their relation is not that good, I don't think they will stay together for 5 or 10 years, but now they're going to celebrate their 15th anniversary on November. Please wait for it \ud83d\udc99. Even though I'm not familiar with this group, but I think Shinhwa should be on the answer too. The members want to stay all together despite the agency only want 5 of them. They chose to move to another agency together, faced so many problems together, and now as far as I know they become the only group who has all member stay together for more than 10 years. ",

            "answer_text": "For me, number 1 will definitely be EXO.  They have a dynamic that remind me of a close-knit family\u2014not friends, but truly brothers that have suffered and cried and braced through so much. Some say their personalities are boring, but it\u2019s the kind of group dynamic that I want to see more in K-pop: they truly show their affection for each other, and you can feel the deep bond they\u2019ve build. Another group that makes me appreciate their dynamic are Red Velvet:  To me, these two groups both act like a family together: they may not show much skin ship or loud affection, but you can definitely feel the bond they\u2019ve built through interactions and their humor. They\u2019re family, and they act like that, both on camera and off camera. Skip the loud humor, the excess skinship, they\u2019re sisters and brothers.   ",
