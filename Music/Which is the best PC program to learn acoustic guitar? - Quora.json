Yousician is a highly interactive and gamified application. It does an excellent job of tracking your playing (recognizing what you played and comparing that to the current lesson\u2019s \u201cideal\u201d) and providing feedback. I believe you can try it for 7 days for free. I\u2019ve also read a lot of reviews praising Rocksmith, which is not a PC application, and requires a console (XBox, Playstation). Since consoles are pretty cheap these days, I thought I would mention that. A screenshot of the \u201cbouncing ball\u201d interactive teaching approach in Yousician:  ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on what kind of music your into. My favorite is Blues Guitar Unleashed. Comes with book, dvds, and online classes and tutorials. This program will break down the blues for you with music theory. Teaching rhythm and lead. Once your done with that you should be able to play in a band with other types of music as well. After taking that course you should know what else you want to learn. Then YouTube it. For easy to intermediate songs it will only take minutes to learn. I have played music on stage I had never played before with the knowledge I applied from this course. Www.bluesguitarinleashed.com ",
