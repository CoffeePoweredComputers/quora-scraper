            "answer_text": "Oh that is a hysterical question! :-) How do you know all of them are singing badly? And by what criteria are you judging the quality? Two things re: the group. There is courage in numbers and bad singers (or timid singers) find their mojo when singing with others and rise above mediocrity.2. If the group sounds good,I guarantee more of the singers are competent than not. Finally. A soloist has no where to hide. All the flaws are his or hers to own. PS. I almost didn\u2019t answer this\u2026but it was just too funny. ",

More people off key or hitting even the proper pitches at slightly different times and pushing out all manner of unattractive tone from nasal whines to gravelly rumblings? Pass please. Just spare me the torture. I would pay good money to head off those loud assaults that masquerade as birthday serenades by restaurant staff in some US chain restaurants. ",
