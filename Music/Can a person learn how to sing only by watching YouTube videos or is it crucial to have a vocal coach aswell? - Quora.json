            "answer_text": "Imho you need a vocal coach too. Things videos can\u2019t do: Personalise your coaching to best suit what you need, and when. People are different and learn at different paces, one person finds something easy and the other finds it difficult, etc.Check you are doing proper breathing and doing the right things with your posture, shoulders, back, etc.Bonding over common interests to develop a closer and more genuine relationship.Support from someone that has been there, done that. Plus, they probably live relatively close to you. That can really help when you feel things are lost and you need encouragement.Emergency help with auditions, finding piano accompanists, networking, etc.",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, there is no replacement for a live, in-person coach or teacher. A YouTube personality can not evaluate your sound and recommend remedies. Failing that, a Skype session or similar (with quality microphone and sound capture equipment) may be an acceptable alternative. You can learn to sing without the reflection of a trained voice teacher, but you are unlikely to proceed as quickly or as effectively on your own until you are extremely developed. ",
