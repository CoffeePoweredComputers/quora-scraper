The human ear reacts to a changes in the sound level than the actual sound itself. Wake up, Wake up, Wake up,it's a brand new day!Wake up, Wake up,Everything begins today, Wake up.Built in song from Micromax.   Awakening can mean the end of sleep, or simply a moment to survey the environment and readjust body position before falling back asleep. Sleepers typically awaken from slow-wave sleep, soon after the end of a REM phase or sometimes in the middle of REM. The rising or setting of the sun, and internal circadian indicators, along with successful reduction of homeostatic sleep need, typically bring about awakening and the end of the sleep episode. Today, many humans wake up with an alarm clock. Scientific studies on sleep have shown that sleep stage at awakening is an important factor in amplifying sleep inertia. Alarm clocks involving sleep stage monitoring appeared on the market in 2005. Using sensing technologies such as EEG electrodes or accelerometers, these alarm clocks are supposed to wake people only from light sleep.",

What ever song you may like when you are awake, when you put it as your alarm ringtone, your mind associates the emotion when you wake up with the song being played. I'm grumpy as hell when I wake up by external force(alarm or my sister slapping my face). If there is a favorite song that is being played at that moment, subconscious mind associates the mood with the song and it will turn into the song that you hate the most. I've ruined the nice feeling that I used to relish by listening to few songs that I used to like. Btw, it can work in opposite way too, If you know what I mean.  ",
