They are a list of notable historical figures and events from the second half of the 20th century largely in chronological order. And they friggin\u2019 rhyme! Here\u2019s a full list, dated: \"We Didn't Start the Fire\" (Facts) History Summary from 1949-1989. The list mixes pop culture and geopolitics on equal terms, as though the Korean War and Marilyn Monroe are of equal significance. To many Baby Boomers, they might as well be. Their lifetimes have spanned the rise of true mass media, where news and entertainment mingle freely and saturate the culture. Landing on the moon and getting high at a rock festival, boxers and the pope, desegregation and the Beatles \u2014 it\u2019s all intertwined. ",
