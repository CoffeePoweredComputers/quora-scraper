            "answer_text": "The bands that influenced zep as a whole were early blues (30's, 40's) artists such as muddy waters, Skip James, and Howlin' Wolf, which is actually why zep called themselves a blues band. but more specifically, the individual bandmates' influences differ slightly, especially throughout the years. John Bonham: Bonzo was reportedly raised by a mother and father who were supportive of his musical passion; young Bonham would bang on pots and pans at the age of five until they eventually bought him a real drum kit at the age of 15. Having grown adept to speed and heavy hitting throughout that gap, his drumming influence mainly consisted of jazz drummers such as: Buddy Rich (made apparent in the live rendition of Moby Dick at Royal Albert Hall, with his use of paradiddles and other rudiments around the set as well as using the kick drum as a driving forces in accordance with the snare in certain parts)Gene Krupa (made apparent also in Moby Dick when he breaks down the snare into the off beats, produces a very choppy sound which resembles Krupa's style very clearly)Earls Palmer (Endurance, chops)Charles Connor (Endurance, Chops)Which would explain his use of rudiments and speed in fills and large span or styles between rock and jazz. Then, upon his skills developing, becoming affiliated with Zeppelin, and music shifting with the change of the era, his influences included: Carmine Appice (The footwork in Good Times Bad Times, bonham said, was directly inspired by a fill Carmine did in an early Vanilla Fudge song. And, hugely, Zeppelin toured with Carmine's band, Vanilla fudge, in 1969, where he showed Bonham his drum set, a Ludwig maple thermogloss set, which was the inspiration for Bonham's signature kit, as well as his affinity for Ludwig drums, which he used for the rest of his career.) Bernard Purdie (Fool in the Rain uses a modified variation of the Bernard's \"purdie shuffle\" called \"Bonham's half time swing\"- which is one of the hardest drum pieces to play)Ginger Baker (Simpler fills, rudiment use, etc.)Max Roach (I have yet to find a specific example of Roach on Bonham's work, but Roach does play a similar set and uses demo black dots, which may have been a source of Bonham to use them, as seen here: Clyde Stubblefield (Funk beats were hugely inspiring to Bonham's sound, and if you've ever heard Clyde Stubblefield it doesn't take much to see how funky he is) And of course there were others but we can't cover them all haha. Jimmy Page: The guitarist, slayer of the 'tang, and casual occultist (lol), grew up a studio musician from a young age, first taking up the guitar after hearing the song \"Baby Let's Play House\" by his original influence: Elvis Presley (also noted are his guitar tones and riff pauses, possibly a direct influence.)But quickly changed gears as he gained popularity among the musicians in the Liverpool area. He even had a tv interview at the age of 14!  Having learned how to mix music and iron out his flaws while being a studio musician quickly moved him to the top of the game, working with popular bands and filling in for performers left and right- shaping his tone and style of playing into his own. Common contenders for his favorite influences were: Scotty Moore (roots rock guitarist)James Burton (roots rock guitarist)Little Richard (roots rock guitarist)Chuck Berry (roots rock guitarist)Among the influences of these and others, as well as Indian and African music, Arabian music and other abstract types of music, he developed his inevitably familiar and recognizable sound. John Paul Jones JPJ grew up in a musical family, his father, Joe Baldwin (pianist and arranger for big bands) taught him how to play the piano with artists such as Charles Mingus (jazz pianist who Jones took inspiration from early on)Big Bill Broonzy (20's Jazz singer and guitar player, similar to Leadbelly, whose band was a factor in Jones' playing)Sergei Richmaninoff (I don't even know what the fuck )in mind. Baldwin, being on tour with big bands often, caused Jones to be in a boarding school much of his life, where he studied music for years. Later on, at the age of 15, he joined his first band called \"The Deltas,\" and he, a year later, bought his first \"Dallas Tuxedo\" electric solid-body bass guitar- which he used for many gigs until he found his next influence in a Chicago jazz LP: Phil Upchurch (Introduced JPJ to the Fender Jazz Bass, which he used for most of his career, up until 1976, influenced his solo like bass riffs notes le in The Lemon Song and What is and What Should Never Be)It was later on that Jones picked up other stringed instruments and keyboards, while being a studio musician and playing with hundreds of famous artists including The Rolling Stones, Their Satanic Majesty's Request (string arrangements can be heard on the song She's Just a Rainbow), Herman's Hermits; Donovan (\"Sunshine Superman,\" \"Hurdy Gurdy Man,\" and \"Mellow Yellow,\") (WikiPedia) and he picked up his use of abstract instrumentation. Robert Plant Plant grew up with a Blues man, his father, being of huge musical influence to him- his father, and his mother, wanted him to pursue music; even from when he was young. But young Plant, or at least from what I can tell from his article, was never much into the blues at first. He used to hide in his curtains, for example, and pretend to be Elvis Presley because the sound of the windows and the curtains made his voice sound good to him. Elvis Presley (Notible in his stage presence and heavy use of sex appeal later on)But as he grew older and his fathers music made a bigger influence on his life, and he I'm sure went through many breakups, the blues started catching his taste. At 16, Plant left training to be an accountant to pursue college, and was meanwhile going from band to band in the Birmingham area to make a name for himself in the blues world. after eventually creating The New Yardbirds, in 1968 with guitarist Jimmy Page, Bassist John Paul Jones, and his Drumming friend, John H. Bonham, that his, and his father's, musical influences began to show more- in terms of lyrics, subject matter, and his deliverance and melody resembling many classical blues artists such as the favorites (most often associated with the whole band, justly) Muddy Waters (lyrical matter, noteable in: I Cant Quit You Baby, Since I've Been Loving You, and, Every Other Zeppelin Song, and swing style, southern blues)Howlin Wolf (Lyrical subject matter, blues licks infused with rhythm, adding a more on the edge appeal to the limits of what you're allowed to say in songs) etc.Little Richard (High pitched gasps, a trait they shared that is noteable in songs such as Since I've been loving you Live, 1973) ~~~~~~~~~~ But most of all, the band's ALL AROUND most notorious influence would have to be [yo Bonham, gimme a drum roll] LEADBELLY LeadBelly was a southern acoustic blues singer and guitar player who sung about the hardships he endured being black in America in the 30's, as well as relationship problems he's had throughout his life: I.e.: the blues. Songs that Zeppelin, we'll say, remade from Leadbelly alone during their trek include Communication Breakdown (possibly)Gallows PoleGood Times Bad TimesHeartbreakerEtc. (still up to debate between whether Howlin wolf, muddy waters, or Leadbelly is #1, but imma go with Leadbelly because I've talked about the others)Anyway, thanks for reading, I hope this answer was useful! -Peace love and rock n roll \u270c -C ",

            "answer_text": "John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers was a big deal in the British music scene throughout the 1960\u2019s, and the Bluesbreaker\u2019s personnel kept evolving as artists left to start new bands, such as Fleetwood Mac, Cream, and The Rolling Stones. Many guitarists jammed in the Bluesbreakers before breaking out on their own and becoming starts, such as Eric Clapton and Mick Taylor. There was a ton of collaboration among artists from different bands in that era, and John Mayall\u2019s project is just one example of how the prominent British musicians of that era influenced each other. Jimmy Page from Zeppelin and Eric Clapton knew each other well and played guitar together. The influence of American Blues and Jazz artists, particularly African Americans such as Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Howlin\u2019 Wolf, and Robert Johnson, can be heard on the many blues style Led Zeppelin songs. Those American artists were a huge influence on not just Zeppelin but other British rockers of that era including The Rolling Stones, The Animals, and John Lennon. In fact Zeppelin covers quite a few blues songs that came from American artists, such as Robert Johnson\u2019s \u201cRiverside Blues\u201d. Contemporary acoustic guitarists such as James Taylor and Joni Mitchell also influenced Jimmy Page. When you listen to a Zeppelin album like \u201cPhysical Graffitti\u201d, which puts together a fascinating collage of sounds and musical textures, it is clear that Zeppelin\u2019s musical influences are from a variety of eras and styles, much more vast than the examples I gave here! I tend to focus on guitar since I am a guitar player, but a drummer may have a different answer as to the influences on John Bonham\u2019s variety of rhythms and percussion, and there is another answer for the influences on Plant\u2019s lyrics, so it is an interesting question but really has to be answered on multiple dimensions.
