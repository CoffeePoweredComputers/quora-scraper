            "answer_text": "Most originals are better than the covers. Most covers add absolutely nothing to the song, while some covers are so despicable it should\u2019ve been a criminal offence (Rolf Harris - Stairway to heaven, I\u2019m looking at you). Five Finger Death Punch made a good fist of \u201cBad company\u201d and while I love both versions I still prefer Bad Co\u2019s. However there have been many where the cover has surpassed the original. Especially when Dylan did the original. Byrds Mr Tambourine Man Dylan Hendrix All along the watchtower Dylan Nutz One more cup of coffee Dylan Ferry A hard rain\u2019s a gonna fall Dylan Manfred Mann Mighty Quinn Dylan MMEB Blinded by the light Springsteen Greg Kihn For you Springsteen Beck Bogert Appice Superstition Stevie Wonder Jeff Beck Cause we\u2019ve ended as lovers Stevie Wonder Hollies The air that I breathe Albert Hammond Nilsson Without you Badfinger Babys Isn\u2019t it time Ray Kennedy Linda Ronstadt I will always love you Dolly Parton Joe Bonnamassa Sloe Gin Tim Curry Rod Stewart First cut is the deepest Cat Stevens Nazareth This flight tonight Joni Mitchell Stone Sour Wicked game Chris Isaak Five Finger Death Punch Gone away Offspring Seether Careless whisper George Michael Off the top of my head.

            "answer_text": "Cover song better than the original: Whitney Houston\u2019s version of \u201cI\u2019m Every Woman\u201d. The original was sung by the legendary Chaka Khan. And Chaka\u2019s version is awesome. In fact, when I heard Whitney was going to cover it, I got VERY nervous, because as much as I loved (and still love) Whitney (and Chaka), I didn\u2019t think ANYONE could improve on the original. Well, happily, I was wrong. Whitney\u2019s version is so good, that it appears to be the only one Chaka gives any credit to (as is her right as the originator). I\u2019m trying to remember if Whitney sang background on the original. She might have. Thanks to her glorious voice and her mom\u2019s connections as a legendary background singer in her own right, she did a LOT of background work before she broke big. Side note: Whitney and her mom, Cissy Houston, worked with Luther Vandross a number of times. Luther always requested Cissy for background vocals whenever she was available. Well Luther worked with David Bowie when Bowie was recording Young Americans. So in light of all that, it\u2019s not surprising but quite fun to spot Cissy Houston (AND Chaka Khan) singing background vocals on the song \u201cUnderground\u201d from the soundtrack to the 1985 film \u201cLabyrinth starring\u2026 David Bowie. You can see them in the DVD behind the scenes footage. Original song better than the cover: Seal\u2019s version of \u201cCrazy\u201d is WAAAAAAYYYY better than Alanis Morissette\u2019s cover version. I love both artists. Seal in particular is special to me besides there\u2019s something practically alchemical in his voice. When he sings his OWN work, it literally feels like the sun is rising in my chest and I feel my internal energy recharging. Alanis moves me too but NOT like THAT. I might be one of the few people who LOVED Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, the follow up to her smash album Jagged Little Pill. She\u2019s not perfect, and there always seems to be a clunker or two on her albums. But there\u2019s also always a SUBLIME offering as well (\u201cPurgatorying,\u201d \u201cIncomplete,\u201d \u201cUtopia\u201d). Sadly though the tone of her voice and her interpretation of \u201cCrazy\u201d somehow leeched ALL the power out of that song. \u201cCrazy\u201d is a song that summons POWER. That\u2019s what Seal\u2019s voice does. There is a credit on one of his albums where he talks about risiing or striking with the force of the PEACEFUL warrior. That\u2019s what his music summons for me (helped along by that fantastic Trevor Horn production). Apparently African (possibly Yoruban but I\u2019m not sure; please forgive my inaccuracies) folklore has a figure called Obtala. He\u2019s a warrior king who fights for justice. THAT is what Seal\u2019s voice encapsulates for me. So sorry, Alanis. I still love your work. But let\u2019s just call your cover of \u201cCrazy\u201d (done because you love the song and who could blame you? Can\u2019t be mad at you for having great musical taste) a loss and move on. No one - as yet - can touch the original\u2026 ",
