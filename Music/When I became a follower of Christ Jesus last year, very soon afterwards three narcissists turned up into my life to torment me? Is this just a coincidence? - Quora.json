            "answer_text": "When it comes to spiritual matters, I do not believe in coincidence. Satan is always looking for an opportunity to attack. Job 2:2 And the LORD said to Satan, \u201cFrom where have you come?\u201d Satan answered the LORD and said, \u201cFrom going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it.\u201d 1 Peter 5:8 \u201cBe sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.\u201d One of Satan\u2019s tactics is to attack through people we could have a potential relationship or those we are already in relationship with; especially nonbelievers. He will try to attack in this manner found in Luke 11:24\u201326, \u201cWhen an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, \u2018I will return to the house I left\u2019. When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order. 26 Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first.\u201d Given that Narcissists present the possibility of causing of trauma i.e. relationship problems, emotional abuse and various other distressing issues. The enemy will absolutely use a Narcissists or any person as bait to distract you with lies that are in opposition to God and His truths. So no, there is no coincidence that three Narcissists would come into your life to test you and your faith. Ephesians 6:12 \u201cFor our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, congratulations on finding your new relationship with the Lord our creator. Our journey is not going to be an easy one but the Lord promises he walks our walk and talks our talk. Through your times of trial just put your trust in him and he will come through for you. You know, now that I think of it. I\u2019m in the exact same situation. Three of my friends\u2026 All believe we are Gods. I think their ways are perfectly summed up in 2 Timothy. 2 Timothy 3:2 But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God\u2014 having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with such people. This verse perfectly describes the three friends I\u2019m dealing with at the moment. They love themselves and acknowledge a form of Godliness but deny its true power (which is that of the Father, the Son and The Holy Spirit). I can safely say to you my friend, those narcissists are not a coincidence. God has given you a glimpse of truth. That what you read in the Bible will coincide with what is going on in the world right now. The best thing to do\u2026 Is what the Bible teaches us to do. Titus 3:10-11 Warn a divisive person once, and then warn them a second time. After that, have nothing to do with them. You may be sure that such people are warped and sinful; they are self-condemned. I hope this answers your question. Please feel free to message me if you have any questions about faith, I am always willing to support a brother. May God bless you. ",
