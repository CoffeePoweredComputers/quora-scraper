            "answer_text": "I personally do not know, but from some of the stories there were times when it wasn\u2019t pleasant to work with her, let alone for her. When you fire your chef because she ate one of the pastries that you instructed her to throw in the garbage, ( with so many hungry people in the world. ) I think that would give you some sort of an idea to start with. Diana Ross is so wrapped up in herself that she would have rather had the pastries trashed then allow the chef to enjoy just one. Diana Ross is known to give her employee\u2019s little room for mistakes, and she could also be a person who was insulting and sometimes cruel in my opinion. In an article: Leona Vs. Diana- Who\u2019s The Real \u201c Queen Of Mean\u201d? you can read just a little of this, and from that time til now nothing seems to have changed. With her delusions of importance and many times feeling that she is superior to others, I can\u2019t see her as someone that I would want to work for, I don\u2019t think too many that have worked for her would say that she is a good boss\u2026.. at least not if they are telling the truth.
