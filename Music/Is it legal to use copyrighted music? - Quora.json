Fair use is a doctrine where you can use copyrighted work, just not all of them, so that people who want to enjoy the work would rather go to the legal sites to watch \u2018em. There are several rules when implementing fair use: Use copyrighted content in a way that pure enjoyers won\u2019t enjoy. This means changing or altering the work, by, let\u2019s say, making a parody, or like lots have done, making critical comments as a character say something, let\u2019s say. The commentary must be critical that people who just want to enjoy the copyrighted content won\u2019t find their home at your work.Use work less than needed. If it is a video, cut unneeded parts. If its a photo, make it low-res, but not too low-res, ofc. If it is a painting, don\u2019t stabilize the camera; rather move it around. Note, works that have lasted for the owner\u2019s life plus 70 years means that the copyright expired and it is in the public domain; you are free to ignore copyright if that\u2019s the case. Works not made by humans (i.e. this painting by a chimpanzee).Only use when needed. Seriously, don\u2019t get to useless. Don\u2019t play copyrighted music throughout your video without context and without mandate. There are tons of public domain and Creative Commons works, you can use them instead if able.That\u2019s just what you need to know about fair use. If you wanna dive into it all\u2014the history blablabla, you can go to this Wikipedia page that I\u2019ve revised before answering this. ",

            "answer_text": "It is not legal to do so without permission. In fact, the U.S. perspective for music and audio tracks is much more restrictive than it is for other content. Fair use is a means to use parts of someone\u2019s work in your own effort (providing you fit the four rules), but courts have judged that music is not applicable when used as samples. And no audio recording is in the public domain; none of them. This is due to a quirk in copyright duration for audio recordings that will resolve itself in another couple of decades. (Although I realize this is off topic.) When someone asks such a broad question like this one, I wonder if they understand what copyright even is: What is the point of copyright? If something is copyright protected, no one can use it at all. The owner has the exclusive right to copy or distribute it. They may give or sell licenses that allow users to use it with their permission. And, in very narrow cases, you can write an article or make a new segment that is about that work, including a sample of that work under fair use. But no, you can\u2019t just use someone\u2019s property without permission. ",
