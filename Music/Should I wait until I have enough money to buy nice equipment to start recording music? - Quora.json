            "answer_text": "I recorded with Audacity and a cheap $2 headset mic and an old acoustic guitar with a cheap $6 magnetic pickup and a cheap P bass and manually exported drum tracks froma demo version of some shareware drum machine when I was in high school. Didn\u2019t stop me from recording. Got me a better PC mic that\u2019s still one of those $2 things. Got me REAPER. Sounded a bit better. Some of my best recordings still come from this era, even if the sound quality is a bit wanting. I got me a USB condenser when I got work, and got my first xmas paycheck. Downloaded a better drum machine thing, and got gifted some $100 Chinese made electric guitar. Some of my worst recordings and one of my bests come from this era. Got me an audio interface so I ditched the USB mic for a normal condenser mic of the same quality. Also got a Mac Mini. I still worked with REAPER so it wasn\u2019t any different from my old Windows setup - the only real difference is that setting shit up is much easier. Getting a Mac doesn\u2019t make sound better. Now I have a Maschine Mikro and a still cheap Dean ML X guitar and a still cheap Stagg Telecaster copy guitar and an also cheap Alesis Q25 controller and I still approach recording the same way I do when I had the most basic shit. If you wait for the good equipment before you start, then you\u2019re just some guy who puts out terrible shit with good equipment. You could\u2019ve started now and learned things and be putting out great shit when you get the good equipment. You seem to think that good equipment makes good records. They do, but only half of it. Don\u2019t think that the skills you have automatically scale up with your equipment. ",

Use whatever you've got in terms of mics, don't worry about getting an Apple, download the excellent Audacity for free, get into it. Don't be afraid of being lo fi. Get used to tracking, mixing and dealing with audio wave forms. Get stuck in, learn as you go, then when you can afford the better gear you'll know what to do with it. ",
