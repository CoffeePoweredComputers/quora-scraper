            "answer_text": "I went to a high school called Great Neck South on Long Island, NY. There was a rival Great Neck North High School as well. Our nickname was the Rebels (Great Neck South Rebels). Great Neck was a very liberal northern Long Island town politically in the late 1960s and 70s. It was very had to find a Republican in Great Neck. Even the very well off area of Kings Point was predominantly Democrats who tended to support the civil rights policies of LBJ as opposed to the Wallace type of separatist policies that was a wing of the GOP (and unfortunately still is). Our school symbol was the Confederate Flag (Army of Virginia Battle Flag). I played on the South football team, and although I declined to have the Confederate Flag patch sewn on my uniform, other players did wear the patch. A black woman sewed the patches on the uniforms, I was told by other players. There was a Confederate Flag on the roof of the high school for awhile. Before the big rivalry football game with Great Neck North (Blazers), there always was a parade of high school students marching through town with rebel flags including some black students and players who waved the flag. In other words, to the student body, the flag represented being from the southern part of town, the high school being named GN South, and the high school nickname being Rebels. There was either little awareness of extent of the historical significance or the amount of disturbance it caused for black people and sympathizers in general. At the time, I felt ambivalent about the flag as a high school symbol. I knew we were using it as a symbol of being from the southern part of town, but I also felt there was something not quite right due to the same flag being adopted by racist groups. I was glad to hear that the high school about 15 years after I graduated, changed the symbol to a Revolutionary War Rebel who fought against the British for US independence as they kept the name Rebels to this day. So I learned that symbols mean different things to different people at different times and places in history, where even the exact same symbol could mean to a particular person something positive as it did to black and/or sympathetic students in high school and later in life it became a very negative symbol to the same people either as the symbol got co-opted by movements one is opposed to, or by learning more about the past history of the symbol.

            "answer_text": "In many cases, it means someone who is either paid off in one way or another (many black GOP pundits on TV, etc. fit this description) or else someone who has bought a \"southern conservative\" ideology hook line and sinker.  Human beings desire to be members of a club or a tribe. In many case, we get more attention by being members of an \"outlaw\" or otherwise opposite club or organization. That's another possibility. Despite those who would offer excuses, the Confederacy was based on an economic system which held that people were owned - bought and sold like cattle. An American black celebrating this is akin to modern Jews waving the Nazi flags and symbols because of all the positive things done by the third reich (roads, infrastructure, etc.). ",
