            "answer_text": "As a guitar player, professional soloist and vocalist for over 50 years, I can add some personal insight to this good question. I\u2019ve owned so many acoustic guitars I feel I have a decent overview of acoustics that is first hand, verses hearsay or second hand assessments. In 1987 I purchased a Yamaha LL-5sc for $650, hard case included. It was the low end of the LL series and came with a solid Sitka spruce top, solid Mahogany back, layered mahogany sides, gold Yamaha tuners, mahogany neck and Rosewood fingerboard and saddle and all gloss finish. I\u2019m looking at it right now 33 years later. When I got it, I owned a 1969 Martin D12\u201328, a 1974 Martin D-18 and two Takamine guitars, a 12 and a 6, for gigs and practice where I was uncomfortable exposing my Martins. The \u2018Talkies\u2019 were decent guitars for the low-medium prices. Around $200 each I believe. They were branded with the \u2018law suit\u2019 Martin headstock logos that really ticked of Martin - ala the law suit which they won. The six string was damaged in a bar fight so needed to replace. Went to a dealer in San Francisco who recommended I look at the Yamaha LL series which he claimed was of superior quality than most of the Yamaha acoustics. He claimed they were hand made in Japan, although \u2018made in Japan\u2019 still had a cheap goods reputation. $650 was a lot of money back then, probably around $2000 in todays money. I had only paid $550 for the Martin D-18 in 1974 and $650 for the D12\u201328 in 1977 (used), so after playing it for an hour or so I relented and bought it. I discovered that it was made in Taiwan, not Japan and almost returned it feeling I was mislead either intentionally or otherwise. But the tone, sustain, playability was amazing for a newly born acoustic I decided to keep it. Good decision. The Martins are gone along with several Taylors and Gibsons, but \u2018Miz Yami\u2019 and I are still a couple. In my music room where I sit, there is a Taylor 714ce, V brace, a Taylor 224K Dlx, a Alvarez Yairi WY-1, an old Talkie 12 string and the Yami LL-5ce (gutted the old electronics). Dozens of AG\u2019s have come and gone, the Taylors and Yairi are only one, two and three years old and the Yamaha 33 years old and plays like butter and has the seasoned tone of beyond description. My son, who was born the same year as Miz Yami, is a professional musician full time. I have gifted him guitars over the years, but he makes no nut and saddle bones about the one he wants. He says he\u2019s torn though. To get the axe, his Dad and best friend have to die. It\u2019s in my will. He says he doesn\u2019t care about the others, just have mom sell them. There\u2019s my take on Yamaha. I\u2019m writing a mini novel here, so I will close. But before I do, two months ago I bought a Yamaha LSTA Trans Acoustic with built in Reverb (room and hall) and chorus, all adjustable low to high. I had always fantasized about having a AG that had great effects WITHOUT BEING AMPED. Even with more volume control. Until two years ago that is - a fantasy and wishful thinking. No more! I will write about this later, but quickly, it is my go-to AC. Effects are amazing, the top Solid Engellman Spruce, ARE aged, sides and back solid EI Rosewood, Ebony fingerboard and saddle, five ply Mahogany and Rosewood neck, Gotah gold tuners, new LL bracing system, beautiful dark sunburst finish and sounds great with or without effects. Out of this world effects though. Workmanship is excellent, and yes, it\u2019s made in China under Yamahas watchful eyes. Cost? $1087, about one third of what I would have paid and worth it. Since I got it I haven\u2019t even picked up my $3300 Taylor. That\u2019s how much I enjoy it. Yamaha, you bet. Great guitars and innovation at good prices. By the way, my THIRD best loved guitar is the Alvarez Yairi, made in Japan and one of the best guitars I\u2019ve ever played or owned. Cost: $1780. AA Red Western Cedar top, solid Rosewood Back and sides, Gotah Gold tuners, near perfect intonation, OM body and perfect fingerstyle guitar. Ok, there\u2019s more than you asked for, but it may help someone make a good decision. Have a Blessed and Happy Day. ",

            "answer_text": "I am not a professional player, so this is my guitar aficionado\u2019s humble opinion which requires a little background information. When I first taught myself to play at 13, all I wanted was a Yamaha guitar, simply because they were the best available where I live. I was not all that aware of the history behind Gibson and Fender back then. Because I am a Latin American, most people I knew would play Mexican or Spanish nylon string classic guitars, yet I liked blues and Rock and Roll much more than Mariachi and Trio music (still do, though I\u2019ve grown to have some appreciation for those too). Yamahas where much more expensive than the cheap Mexican guitars that you could buy for 40 US$ or so, and certainly more than I could afford on my allowance as a middle class Honduran rock star wannabe. Still, I saved some money and when I was nineteen I finally bought me a 150 US$ Yamaha acoustic which was pretty expensive for me at the time (can\u2019t remember which model, the sticker was pulled off after it got caught on a storm years ago, but I think it\u2019s one of the FG 400 series) on which I could finally get that bluesy, great quality sounds that I longed for since I was 13. It still sits in my 14 year old son\u2019s room, almost 30 years later, though it\u2019s color has long since faded and it has scratches all over. The bridge is a little bent, so the middle frets tend to over vibrate a bit now, but otherwise it\u2019s still ok. It accompanied me through trips, parties, adventures and a few gigs (back when I still had rock and roll dreams). I have bought a few more guitars since. I own a Gibson Les Paul, an Ibanez A75 arch top and a few acoustics of different brands. I have also become a way more proficient player since and have played on Fenders, Martins and a few others. I forget about my old Japanese pal most of the time, yet whenever I pick my old Yamaha up, the sounds that come out of it are the sweetest of all. Of course, a high end Gibson or Martin is a great guitar. However, maybe it\u2019s because it has life in it (every scratch or crack on it has a story), but my 150 $, 29 year old, beat up Yamaha remains my favourite one. ",

            "answer_text": "From the nature of your question, I'm going to assume that you are fairly new to the guitar world. Yamaha is a large company that has manufactured many different instruments for decades, in several countries. Their attention to quality control means that Yamaha guitars, both electric and acoustic, are consistently well made. Many older Yamaha models are becoming highly collectable, such as the \u201cred label\u201d acoustics and the high end \u201cSG\u201delectrics. You simply can't go wrong starting out on a Yamaha. Even a modestly priced model F310 acoustic sounds good and (for the price level) is very well made. High end Yamaha guitars are typically exquisitely high quality and consistently well reviewed. One example is their LL series of acoustics. Beautiful but pricy. One answer implies that Yamahas are not used by professional musicians. That's not the case. Many, many working musicians play Yamaha guitars. But you may not see many superstars play Yamaha. Why? Mostly, history. Most older rock and pop stars are American or British, and in the 1950s and 60's, the American companies Gibson and Fender dominated the electric guitar market. Gibson and Martin (Another American company) made higher end acoustics back then. Yamaha marketed modestly priced guitars for the student market. Britain didn't manufacture any quality guitars back then, so any half serious British rocker would seek out an American guitar. Now, many younger players look and listen to what their idols played and so many also choose Gibson, Fender and Martin guitars. That is when they can afford them. Ironically, these days there are many other brands (including Yamaha) that make superb instruments that are much less expensive than these (in my opinion) overpriced brands. ",

            "answer_text": "I own 2 Yamaha guitars, an electric Yamaha Pacifica which I paid \u00a3100 (uk) which I guess is about 20 years old and a 12 string acoustic FG-412-12 which I paid \u00a365 for which is older still. Both have brought me huge amounts of pleasure over 100 of hours of play. For information I also have a hand built 6 string acoustic and an American built Thinline Telecaster. I searched pretty widely when looking for a reasonable priced electric and played lots of Squiers, epiphones and Ibanaz guitars but until I was playing guitars selling for minimum \u00a3400 second hand they just didn\u2019t feel nice to play. The moment I saw the Yamaha and just run my fingers across the strings it sounded bright and alive and the neck feels really comfortable and gives nice feedback in my hand. I bought it immediately without even plugging it in. I still have it and love playing it. The 12 spring kind of fell into my lap and for that sort of money it wasn\u2019t worth looking further. I am looking to upgrade the 12 string now, but for an 80\u2019s Takamine for way more than I paid for Yamaha. In my view at the beginner to intermediate level Yamaha guitars are the best choice. The consistency of the guitars means you cannot go far wrong and they are hugely versatile instruments. In the UK they are widely available second hand and the build quality is such that even old guitars don\u2019t really depreciate. If you buy second hand you can use for it for a few years and then trade up, you probably will be able to sell it for pretty much what you paid. Or alternatively keep them as you have grown to love them. Yamaha do produce professional level instruments, the SG and SA series are very highly regarded, but I have never actually played one so I cannot comment. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what model of Yamaha but generally Yamaha makes a good guitar. Some models are actually great guitars. For me at least the SG 3000 was one of the best guitars ever made. It was certainly better than any Les Paul in my opinion. Currently I have a Yamaha SG 2000 that was built in 1978 and is the model Carlos Santana helped design. Back in the days when Carlos did the song Black Magic Woman he was playing a SG 2000. Many of the SG series are great guitars as long as it is above SG 1000 model. The SG models below that are still good but not great like the higher models. I used a SG 800 in the studio and it did a fine job but it had a set neck and for me they were not as good as the neck thru models, There are many other great Yamaha guitars and even some of the cheaper models like the Pacifica are still good guitars but the older models seem better in my opinion. I have owned probably 10\u201312 Yamaha guitars and they are good guitars to own and are usually a well made guitar. You really can't go wrong buying one. I have owed over 600 guitars in my life and had so many different brands and models I can\u2019t remember them all but I certainly remember many of the bad ones and the very best ones. For me Yamaha ranks as the best ones I\u2019ve owned. I especially love the ones produced in the late 70\u2019s through the 80\u2019s. ",

After many possessions, exorcisms, and repossessions (yes, I do this too, to help that bloke in the hat out when he does not get paid), I am quite well versed at making a guitar scream, making the wax in the pickups froth and rotating a guitar\u2019s neck 360-degrees like in that one movie, before leaving in a stench of sulphur to go find my next guitar to possess. I possessed a fantastic classical Yamaha guitar once. It was well built, sounded great, was good value for money and was a good place for me to inhabit and lie low for a while from all these pesky, benevolent deities. The guy who owned the guitar, however, was not a very good player and regularly invoked the names of various gods and deities while practising - badly so. This hexery vexed me and eventually I had to leave on my own accord through self-exorcism. The moral is this: The guitar is only as good to possess as what the player is who owns it. ",

            "answer_text": "One does not posses guitars, they posses you ;) But yes. Yamaha guitars are GREAT guitars to own. Even the low end Yamaha guitars are very nice sounding, the action is usually well set up and they last. In the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s they were often the guitar of choice for Country music bands and are still high quality. They are a better value than Martin or Gibson guitars FOR THE PRICE. They are great starter guitars and even up into the stage when you start gigging. Later on when you start visiting music stores and learn more about guitars, you will find that you may become unfaithful to your Yamaha. (It\u2019s better to be unfaithful to your guitar than to your woman.) A very high end guitar will peak your interest and feel just right\u2026. and you\u2019ll buy it. But yeah! Yamaha guitars are great. As are Ibanez guitars and Blueridge. Good luck and enjoy the journey. ",
