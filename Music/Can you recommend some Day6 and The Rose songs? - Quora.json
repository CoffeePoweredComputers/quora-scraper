DAY6 is probably my favorite group, but there are a few songs that I like a little more than the others\u2026 I Need Somebody (This song deserves a Grammy), \uadf8\ub7f4 \ud150\ub370 (I Would), Stop The Rain, You Were Beautiful (ENG & KOR version), Congratulations, Wish (\ubc14\ub798), I'll try (\ub178\ub825\ud574\ubcfc\uac8c\uc694), COLORS, and I Loved You And so many more.

And I actually came here to get some recommendations as well especially on Day6, cause I know The rose a little better. But I\u2019ll leave some recommendations anyway. DAY6: As I said, I haven\u2019t heard a lot of their music, but their song \u201cShoot me\u201d was the one who made me invested and wanted to learn more about them and here some of their other songs. \u201cSweet chaos\u201d is also a great song! The rose: My favorite is definitely \u201cshe\u2019s in the rain\u201d it\u2019s such a beautiful song, and if the song itself doesn\u2019t make you cry, it will when you read the lyrics\u2026Other songs I really like from them are, \u201cSorry\u201d, \u201cBaby\u201d and \u201cRed\u201d ",

Also, recently they performed a cover of The Script\u2019s \u201cBreakeven\u201d! As for Day6, all their songs are amazing and never disappoint! One of the first songs I listened to is \u201cCongratulations\u201d, there is the English version of that; you should check the original and the English versions! \u201cLetting Go\u201d by Day6 is really good and you can feel the emotions they pour into the song and the music video. You should listen to all their songs! haha ",
