            "answer_text": "Unquestionably the Beatles. John, Paul, George and Ringo sit heads and shoulders above the rest. Here\u2019s several reasons why: Influence: In the 1960s & 70s, everyone wanted to look, act, and sound like the Beatles: haircuts, beads, Neru Jackets, etc. They opened people\u2019s mind politically and socially. And the list of artists that they directly influenced is endless: from Aha, Billy Joel, the Clash, Don McClean, Erasure, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Greenday, Howard Jones, INXS, Jet, \u2026 Prince, Queen, the Ramones, Squeeze, Tom Petty, U2, Vapors, Wham!, XTC, Yaz and Zebra. They led the first British Invasion to America, and by many accounts are responsible for influencing the 2nd British Invasion (\u201880\u2019s New Wave). The 1967 BBC broadcast of \u201cOur World\u201d was the first global satellite music event for which the Beatles composed \u201cAll You Need is Love\u201d; hundreds of millions around the world tuned in. Kids born 30 years after the last Beatles song was recorded, know and are familiar with at least some of their most popular songs. You can\u2019t say that for most bands.Record sales: Top 5 songs simultaneously in Billboard\u2019s Top 100; until Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller, no one sold more records. In just 7 years they recorded 7 albums, 22 singles, 4 EPs, and made 4 movies. They traditional songs into hits (\u201cHappy Birthday\u201d, \u201cMy Bonnie\u201d). Even average / not great albums went platinum. As hinted in the song \u201cSgt. Pepper\u201d (\u201cIt was 2- years ago today \u2026.\u201d), 20 years after each single was recorded Apple issued a picture disc 45rpm record that had the picture from the 45-jacket embedded on the disc. They sold out instantly and became highly sought after collectibles.Talent: Substantial roots (American rock-n-roll), fertile grounds (Merseyside in Northern England) and great timing (1960\u2019s) aside, these 4 boys had genuine talent; each went on to superstar solo careers. They wrote their own songs at a time when record companies dictated what the artists would perform. Not just Lennon & McCarthy, but the distinct genius of George Harrison. And they wrote other artists\u2019 material (Marvelettes, Anne Murray, Rolling Stones, etc.).Musical Evolution: Their music, with inclusion of other styles, experimentation, and innovation never before seen defines musical evolution: early raw rock, quiet folk rock, introspective blues, country cross over, soft ballads, power ballads, fun goofy songs, complex rock (laying the foundation for album oriented rock), genuine quotable poetry and inspirational story telling. They blazed new trails, added Piccolo trumpet (Penny Lane), Sitar (Norwegian Wood), Recorder (Fool On The Hill), and other instruments to popular songs. They invented the concept album (Sgt. Pepper), parodied themselves (Yellow Submarine), and got a 7 minute song on the radio (Hey Jude) at a time when radio stations refused to play anything more than 3\u20131/2 minutes. Then they created their own record label.Humble Beginnings: 4 poor lads from Liverpool; no money, no training, no plan, and two of the 4 came from single parent homes. Against these odds arose a band that changed the world.Global Appeal: They started in Liverpool, England, honed their craft in Hamburg, Germany, conquered America, and then toured the world. They even recorded songs in German.Revered by their peers: Other successful musicians praised them publicly; Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Ray Charles, Marvin Gaye, Bob Dylan and Mick Jagger among them. They were known to perform and collaborate with Eric Clapton, Elton John, Billy Preston, Jimmy Page, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Billy Joel, Sting, Tom Petty and Roy Orberson.Cross-Discipline Realities: Is there another Rock-n-Roll band that can prove a mathematical law? The Beatles, Wings, John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Star from 1960 - 1998 proved unequivocally that \u201cThe whole is greater than the sum of it\u2019s parts\u201d.A Social Statement: The Beatles were more than a rock band. Like all great artists, they both expressed and reflected the times they lived in. They defined the 1960s and shaped the 70s & 80s. Song title phrases like Working Class Hero, All You Need is Love, Give Peace a Chance, You Say You Want a Revolution?, and Let it Be all resonate in the hearts and minds of those who grew up in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. They paved the way for Bob Geldorf (Band Aid), U2 and other politically sensitive artists to thrive while sending their message.Summary: While there were lots of great rock bands that added incredible color dimension and advancement to rock-n-roll in their own right, there is not a single other band that offered each of the categories above. The appropriate parable in Baseball is Babe Ruth: He was the one of the most incredible hitters that ever played the game and simultaneously one of the most incredible pitchers that ever played the game. The Beatles are the Babe Ruth of rock music",

            "answer_text": "I would like to take the name of not 1 but 3 top bands for me and for most of the people all around the world: 1) The BeatlesThey are unquestionably the best and most important band in rock history, as well as the most compelling story. Almost miraculously, they embodied the apex of the form artistically, commercially, culturally and spiritually at just the right time, the tumultuous '60s, when music had the power to literally change the world (or at least to give the impression that it could, which may be the same thing). The Beatles are the archetype: there is no term in the language analogous to \u201cBeatlemania.\u201d The Beatles generated an intensity of joy that slapped tens of millions of people in the face with the awareness that happiness and exuberance were not only possible, but in their presence, inevitable. They generated an energy that was amplified a million times over and returned to them in a deafening tidal wave of grateful hysteria. 2) Led Zeppelin Over a 10-year, nine-album career from 1969-79, Led Zeppelin was the most popular rock group in the world, ultimately selling more than 50 million records in the U.S. alone (more than 200 million worldwide), developing the blues-based power trio-plus-lead singer archetype in many directions including mystical English folk-rock, Middle Eastern-influenced exotica, quirky pop and every manner of heaviness. They also came to symbolize the Dionysian excesses of the rock lifestyle. 3) Pink FloydPink Floyd is the most eccentric and experimental multi-platinum band of the album rock era, creating exceptional cinematic sound sculptures \u201cMeddle,\u201d \u201cDark Side of the Moon,\u201d \u201cWish You Were Here,\u201d and the band\u2019s popular apex and conceptual death knell, \u201cThe Wall.\u201d They well-known rock bands of the progressive rock genre, capturing the essence of lengthy instrumental passages and complementing them with memorable vibes and clear lyrics. Their concepts were compelling, from early psychedelic eccentricities to the formation of a concept album. ",

            "answer_text": "My list and ranking of the greatest , best , and my most favourite rock bands of all time , in respective order , and why I think they are the best are : 1) The Beatles - The songwriting partnership of Lennon - McCartney duo (credited to the members of The Beatles and English musicians : John Lennon and Paul McCartney) is fantastic and the greatest (in my opinion) , released great and widely influential albums in the late 1960\u2019s (most notably being : Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967) , and Abbey Road (1969) , wrote simple songs that had not too enough complex compositions that topped the US Billboard charts , were the progenitors / revolutionized and innovated the idea of an \u201c album \u2019\u2019 to be the most dominant and important form in music rather than a \u201c single \u2019\u2019 , were also the progenitors / revolutionized and innovated the idea of playing in front of a live audience at the stadium (most notably playing the 1st ever stadium show and were the 1st ever stadium music acts to play at the famous Shea Stadium concert in 1965) and how the music should be recorded , their ability to shed / shun and diminish their celebrity image from the \u201c 4 mop tops who had huge popularity in the early 1960\u2019s \u201c Beatlemania \u2019\u2019 as \u201c teen idols \u2019\u2019 to the real musicians they became while shedding their former images while producing and releasing the greatest rock records of all time \u2019\u2019. 2) Queen - The stage presence and vocal \u201c singing \u2019\u2019 skills along with innovating and changing the way how frontman should act and dress on stage of Freddie Mercury (the lead vocalist \u201c singer \u2019\u2019 / frontman of Queen) , the guitar playing skills of Brian May (the lead guitarist of Queen) which in my opinion is vastly underrated , the multi-talented Roger Taylor (drummer of Queen) who is also hugely underrated , Their ability and talent to write and compose complex structured songs that appeal to both masses and classes while becoming anthems worldwide for sporting events (most notably being \u201c Bohemian Rhapsody \u2019\u2019 , \u201c We Will Rock You / We Are The Champions \u2019\u2019) , Their live stage performances together while performing as a band (most notably being in the 1985 Live Aid). 3) Led Zeppelin - The electrifying stage presence and wide vocal \u201c singing \u2019\u2019 range along with changing the way how frontman should act of Robert Plant (the lead vocalist \u201c singer \u2019\u2019 / frontman of Led Zeppelin) , the extremely significant and best guitar playing innovative skills and techniques of Jimmy Page (the lead guitarist and founder of Led Zeppelin) , the best drumming skills in fast speed which are uncomparable of John Bonham (drummer of Led Zeppelin) , Their live stage performances together while performing as a band , composing and writing \u201c Stairway To Heaven \u2019\u2019 which is considered to be one of the greatest rock songs of all time. 4) The Rolling Stones - The great combination of musical collaboration on their music and even while performing together on stage / live for the band between the frontman / lead vocalist \u201c singer \u2019\u2019 Mick Jagger and lead guitarist Keith Richards , Their (and all the band members : Mick Jagger on lead vocals , Keith Richards on lead guitar , Brian Jones on many other different instruments (till his death) , Charlie Watts on drums , Bill Wyman on bass guitar , and Ronnie Wood also on lead guitar) experience of  live stage performances together as a band , shedding and successfully reducing and removing their celebrity images (along with their rivals , The Beatles) from \u201c bad boys / and teen idols \u2019\u2019 to \u201c great yet hugely successful live musical act that produced sensible and self composed / written records \u2019\u2019. 5) U2 - The passionate yet spiritual-like sounding vocals of Bono (lead vocalist \u201c singer \u2019\u2019 / frontman of U2) , Their live stage performances together while performing as a band (most notably having multiple highest grossing concert tours to their name) , ",

            "answer_text": "In no order, who would you say are the top five rock bands of all time? I\u2019m going to look at this in terms of influence on the industry, other artists, and creativity, not just on popularity or who sold the most concert tickets or albums. The Beatles - Just think about what they did in such a short amount of time and the bands that credit them as a major influence in their own careers. They continue to define rock 50+ years after forming.Led Zeppelin - Few bands have been as widely imitated as Led Zeppelin. Their music dominated Album Oriented Rock stations and continues to be played today.Nirvana - I don\u2019t think that the Grunge movement in music would have been as huge as it was without Nirvana, and this band permanently changed the face of rock.The Clash - A punk band with social statement undertones, during their heyday they were called \u201cThe Only Band That Matters\u201d by many in the industry.The Ramones - One of my favorite bands to see play live. Their 3 chord, 3 minute max songs just rocked. They were the original punk band and it was a nice escape from the hell that was disco in the 70\u2019s. Among the groups that have credited The Ramones influence are Green Day and one of my favorites U2. In an interview for Time magazine, U2\u2019s lead singer Bono said of the Ramones \"When we first formed the band, Adam and I were 16, Edge was 15, and Larry was 14, and we were fans of the Ramones. They kind of stopped the world long enough for bands like U2 and others to get on... We were a band before we could play. We formed our band around an idea of friendship and shared spirit. That was a preposterous notion before the Ramones.\"Honorable mentions: The Rolling StonesThe WhoFleetwood MacBob Marley & The WailersThe White Stripes",

            "answer_text": "Alright, here\u2019s my top 10 best rock bands of all time - 1- Led Zeppelin- Absolutely no room for argument here. Robert Plant on vocals and Jimmy Page on the guitar and John Bonham on the drums was an utterly sick partnership. Extra-ordinarily creative as these dudes were and mind-numbingly sensational, this band had it all- lyrics, attitude, insane skill to develop the kind of music nobody ever could during the 70\u2019s. 2- Pink Floyd- My mind is always in a battle to decide who should be number 1, Zeppelin or Pink Floyd. Probably both these legendary bands should be placed at a similar pedestal for the kind contribution they\u2019ve made to rock in their own ways. \u201cComfortably numb\u201d and \u201cWish you were here\u201d still remain one of my all-time favorite rock songs. 3 -Queen - Ahhh!! Queen- I\u2019ve always been such a massive fan of Freddie Mercury and his band. Freddie was the soul of this band, super energetic voice and an indefatigable performer. This was such a complete band. \u201cUnder Pressure\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t stop me now\u201d are my favorites. 4- The Beatles- Probably the band with best singers on it in Paul Mccartney and John Lenon. These prodigious legends will always be irreplaceable. There are so many songs of them that I absolutely love, If I have to name one its gotta be \u201cHey Jude\u201d. 5- Avenged Sevenfold- You must be wondering who the fuck are these guys. I wont say much about them. Just check them out once if you haven\u2019t yet and I can promise you that wont be disappointed. Start with these tracks- So far away, Seize the day, and A little piece of heaven. This is one hell of a band which holds a really special space in my heart. Solid lyrics, insane guitarists, probably had one of THE BEST drummers on the band. RIP Jimmy Sullivan. I know, I said I wouldn\u2019t say much about them, But couldn\u2019t resist. Another reason this band is so fucking good is because its probably among the very few modern bands which still consistently makes fantastic rock stuff even today, in a time where we are surrounded with garbage musicians making utter garbage, bands like these remind us that rock is still alive. 6- Radiohead- Plain genius. Beautiful and classical compositions coupled with lyrics so cryptic, deep and nonchalant that will make you completely lost. Their track \u201cCreep\u201d has to be in the rock hall of fame for being one of the greatest rock songs of all time. I could listen to it all day. 7- Red Hot Chili Peppers- C\u2019mon! who does not love RHCP. \u201cCalifornication\u201d Don't forget me\u201d \u201cUnder the bridge\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t stop\u201d \u201cSnow\u201d, so many brilliant songs. Has to be at 6th for me. Long live RHCP! 8-Nirvana- Another great band, their heavy lyrics with some intense inclusion of grunge rock rightfully earned them an unparalleled cult following which is still growing today. 9- Foo fighters- Was a really difficult choice to make. To place them on 9th on the list was a bit tricky for me, but nevertheless, a good band who made some great songs over the years. I always was a big admirer of Dave Grohl since his Nirvana days. Their new album was a bummer though. 10- I can't think of a band that should be 10th on my list. There are so many names that are popping up in my head. Will probably update once I zero in on a band worthy of a 10th spot. ",

            "answer_text": "Was The Beatles a rock band or a pop band? The Beatles was surely the best band so far, so if they were a rock band, then they are number 1. But, generally speaking, rock lists don\u2019t tend to include them, so I\u2019ll leave them out for now. Just put them back in at #1 if you consider them to be a rock band. \u2018Of all time\u2019 means \u2018of all time so far\u2019. In which case: #1 Led Zeppelin. There was a world pre-Zeppelin, and there was a world post-Zeppelin. They changed everything, more than anyone else did, ever. At least as far as rock bands are concerned. #2 The Rolling Stones. I was never a fan \u2014 born at the wrong time \u2014 but for pure bandsmanship, they out-showed everyone else. I could put Queen in that slot for the same reason, but the Stones were, well, the Stones. #3 U2. Again, I wasn\u2019t really a fan in the 1980s, but this is the only band which has been at the forefront of relevance for almost forty years. In terms of longevity without ever becoming a self-tribute act, these are the greatest. Bands that were amazing bands but couldn\u2019t qualify for the \u2018greatest\u2019 in any of these three criteria include: Queen: glamorous, exquisite musicians, innovators. But they can\u2019t out-Zeppelin Zeppelin for musical ability, and they didn\u2019t out-showman the Stones.Pink Floyd: so, so good, just not the top.Fleetwood Mac: Rumours is still one of the greatest albums ever, but their other material didn\u2019t live up to it.Dire Straits. Amazing, and coming back into fashion, but they were also on the borders between rock and pop. If they\u2019d ever turned it right up\u2026Lynyrd Skynyrd. What could they have become if it weren\u2019t for that aircrash?Genesis. Another superb band.The Police. I so much wanted to put these in the top three, but couldn\u2019t achieve it.The Ramones. Think the Sex Pistols invented punk? Forget it, the Ramones were there long before them.Evanescence. One amazing album. But the tension between the leaders died when one of them left, and nothing they made after that was the same.Florence and the Machine. Lots of time yet for Florence Welch to make that definitive statement\u2026 here\u2019s hoping.Black Sabbath. If Zeppelin didn\u2019t invent heavy metal, then Sabbath did. But unlike Zeppelin, they stayed in one place.The Who. Eclipsed by their peers, they still had everything, maybe not quite in the same quantities as the top three.Status Quo. For many people, Status Quo was rock music.The Jimi Hendrix Experience. If it wasn\u2019t for the name, this band would get a lot more credit. They were three outstanding musicians. Everyone talks about Hendrix. I think if he had lived longer, the band would have established more of its own identity.The Yardbirds. Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page all got their starts here. No other band was the beginning of so much.Van Halen. They seem a bit 80s now, but, back in the 80s\u2026 well, they rocked.",

            "answer_text": "It is so subjective to give a definitive answer for this. The great rock bands can be judged on so much criteria. Here are my answers for different reasons. The Beatles - They had such a wide variety of styles. A band that was only making albums for 7 years and had a mass following because of the quality of the music primarily. They are also the first band to really get popular writing their own songs. The personalities of each member of the band is known well by just about anyone alive right now. They broke up over 40 years ago and people of all ages love them just as much today as they ever did. AC/DC - The great simple hard rock band. These guys found something they were good at and stuck with it. They are as great today as they were in the 70s. They are still the greatest heavy rock band around, and their sound has not changed one iota. Led Zeppelin - The learned thinkers of rock. Played solidly and didn't give in to studio commercialism to release singles. They made it solely on albums. That's pretty impressive if you think about it. Plus the music has a driving power and thoughtful solemnity that overshadows all bands that came after them. The Who - We wouldn't have stage antics like guitar smashing without them. The music is solid, expertly written, produced, and performed. They are alos the loudest band in the world. That has to count for something. Queen - The showman playboys of rock. No band has ever, or will ever, match the true showmanship of this band. They had an awesome sound that is practically timeless and they can also boast the greatest front man who ever lived. Freddie Mercury is the most profuse singer in the history of popular music. Rolling Stones / U2 / Pearl Jam - I'm am calling a three way tie for these guys. Why? They have stuck it out for a long time. Sure there have been line up changes or long breaks, but all three have continued to make new music and haven't lessened in quality. That's a real tough thing to accomplish. U2 are the longest lasting band without a line up change. A lot of people on here have put forward Bob Dylan. He's not a band, he's a singer/songwriter. Also, he's not best known for his rock music. He's a folk genius, don't get me wrong, but I can't put him on a list of great rock bands. Just my opinion. Hope this answer is helpful to anyone. ",

            "answer_text": "Original question: Who do you think are/were the greatest rock bands of all time, and why? Yes, I do think The Who were the greatest rock band of all time. Not long ago, after watching an interview with Chuck Klosterman, I went out and bought his latest book: But What If We're Wrong? The idea that Klosterman explores in this book is to understand how the present might be viewed a couple of centuries in the future, when it has become the past. It's an interesting conceit. In the second chapter, which talks about music, Klosterman suggests that the story of rock and roll (or rock 'n' roll, or just rock) is likely to be told by focusing on a single iconic musician. He provides some good arguments in favor of his choice for this iconic rocker: Chuck Berry. And when a pop-culture expert (and the author of both Fargo Rock City and Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs) makes a pronouncement like that, you have to consider it pretty seriously. And make no mistake about it, Chuck Berry was fantastic. But, in this case, Klosterman's wrong. And, of course, given the structure/nature of his book, he might even agree with me when I say that he's wrong. To fully understand the argument, you have to imagine that it's the 23rd century. (The Enterprise has presumably just left on its five-year mission to boldly go where no man has gone before.) You're putting together the syllabus for a course called something like \"The History of Popular Music in the Western World\". You've already finished the lecture on \"March\", which is personified, as everyone knows, by John Philip Sousa. (This is the example that Klosterman provides for how our present has simplified its view of this part of the past history of music.) You then cover \"Ragtime\", which is personified by Scott Joplin. (You, the present day reader rather than the 23rd century music scholar, might think that ragtime would be better personified by Jelly Roll Morton. And you're right about the greatness of Jelly Roll Morton, of course, but still wrong nevertheless. Our present has already decided that Joplin is Ragtime.) The next lecture obviously has to cover \"Jazz\". I admit that I can't figure out if jazz will be personified by Louie Armstrong, Duke Ellington, or Miles Davis. This difficulty probably results from the fact that we're still a little too close (historically) to jazz for this distillation to have taken place. Maybe jazz can get two lectures (between the two world wars, personified by Ellington, and after World War II, personified by Davis). But eventually, you have to put together the lecture on \"Rock\". And so, to help you along, I've compiled a list to help persuade you that you should tell the story of rock using The Who as the canonical/iconic example. Rock is primarily the product of bands, not of individual musicians. And The Who, obviously, are a band.The heart of rock and roll lives in England. (Pacem, Huey Lewis. It's not in New York or LA or even Austin.) The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Kinks, the Animals, the Yardbirds, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin.... And, of course, The Who.Woodstock. Festivals are an important factor in the history of rock. And Woodstock was the iconic festival. This criterion rules out the Beatles as the iconic rock band. And you have to tell a very different story if you use the Rolling Stones and Altamont.My Generation.Art school. An amazing number of English bands/musicians started/met in art school. Pete Townshend's fellow students at Ealing Art College included Ron Wood and Freddie Mercury.Destruction. In June 1964, Pete Townshend started the practice of destroying his guitar on-stage as part of his live performances. Keith Moon extended this to his drum set. And to hotel rooms....Roger Daltrey's fringed vest. And his scream.My Generation. And Won't Get Fooled Again.Keith Moon. Widely regarded as the greatest drummer in rock. Died of an overdose of clomethiazole while trying to control the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Which, of course, makes him the iconic rock drummer. And drummers matter. I think it was Duke Ellington who explained this best: \"In jazz, the drummer plays with the band. In rock, the band plays with the drummer.\"Loudness. The Guinness Book of World Records lists a 1976 concert by The Who in London as the loudest rock concert in history, at 126 decibels.The invention of the rock opera (Tommy; Quadrophenia).My Generation. And Won't Get Fooled Again. And Pictures of Lily. And Pinball Wizard. And Baba O'Riley....And that's all without even mentioning John Entwhistle, who was voted the greatest bass guitarist of all time in a 2011 Rolling Stone poll.",

            "answer_text": "1. Rolling Stones - cover band, derivative, blues thieves, I don't care, I still listen to them regularly - Gimme Shelter is practically the second US National Anthem.2. Led Zeppelin - It is still hard hard rock. Will have you pulling apart the sofa looking for drugs 30 years after the fact. ==== 3. Beatles - I understand why people would rank them higher. Never been that into them myself. ==== 4. The Who5. Pink Floyd6. The Clash - 2nd album is kinda weak, everything else is strong EDIT: I see from some comments that the Clash might not be all that. I'm just old enough, early 40s, where the Clash is my Who or Led Zeppelin. By that time, the Who and Zep were the geezers so to speak. It's hard to overstate the impact The Clash, Black Market Clash and Sandinista had on my musical interests. Does that make them worthy or just personal? R.E.M. was better than U2 overall, but after around 1992 the music just wasn't as good/interesting to me. I still listen to the earlier stuff. First 3 records are perfection. I thought U2 was interesting at first, but overall, I don't think they are very good and do not really understand their success. After Joshua Tree, they just fell off for me. I don't even want to hear the old stuff. At the time though, I thought the first 3 records were pretty compelling. Maybe it was the Steve Lillywhite effect? They can't really make this list, but, man, I really like The Fall.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_(band) Since Van Halen I was a 1978 release, it's pretty easy to make a case that they had an absolute influence over the next ~15 years. That record was 1986 LA Glam, but in 1978. Impressive. Problem with them is 1984 sucked, and everything after that sucked too. ",

            "answer_text": "Top 5? Wow, I would have to think in terms of the innovators who actually steered the direction of Rock (IMHO) Let's start with this man. Yes I know you said bands, but he is among the early founders of what became rock and roll.  Elvis Presley, along with people like Little Richard, Bo Diddly, defined rock music in its seminal days. Elvis gave us the style and the swagger. Leather jackets, greaser hair and the gyrations.  The Beatles started with the raw material of rock and took the world on a trip. They were one of the biggest influences on culture in the 20th century and musically evolved the genre through the power ballad, screaming vocals, and pioneering psychadelic rock. What about these guys?  The Beach Boys brought us the endless Summer. While many couldn't commit to the moptop Beatles who made long hair and the hippy style the trend, these guys brought a wholesome look. But they brought much more. Tight harmonies and interesting music which in its own way evolved (check out Pet Sounds). They were also pioneers in studio technology. These were the guys I listened to in school:  Not the shmaltsy love song band of the eighties, but chicago the band of the early 70s that influenced people like Jimmy Hendrix. Their music was said to force Berklee School of music to rewrite their music theory course. Not only did they blend styles of Rock and jazz, but they brought complexity to the music through complicated harmonies and rhythm. Finally, if I had just one more band to choose it would be this one:  Rush took us on a musical journey of fantasy and energy. They were story tellers and dreamers who combined the complexities of the other innovators but defined the genre of the power trio. What a hard question to answer. So many choices and directions to take. A few controversial choices of my own and several that I can't imagine having to leave out. How could we have rock without Chubby Checker, Yes, Boston, Van Halen, not to mention the punk rockers, psychedelic rock, oh yeah and Frank Zappa. Thanks for letting me try. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to compromise and say The Rolling Stones. If the question was \u201cWhich is the greatest album rock band of all time\u201d then the answer would be the Beatles. Their catalogue holds up better than any other artist. They came, they released 7 years of brilliant studio albums, and they left before they started releasing crap. All their albums are great and their influence can\u2019t be denied. But their live shows were terrible. They were great, sloppy but great, in the early cavern days but in their successful era they played 25 minute sets where they had a bored run through of their standard set list to screaming audiences who couldn\u2019t hear a word they sang. If the question was \u201cWhat\u2019s the greatest live band of all time\u201d then my answer would be The Grateful Dead. There was nobody else like them and when they were \u201con\u201d (which they were more often than not) their concerts were incredible. Nobody else could deliver three hours of incredible, improvised rock and roll and then return the next night and deliver a completely different, but just as good, three hours. There\u2019s never been a live group like them before or since. But their albums were often terrible. American Beauty and Workingman\u2019s Dead are both great, and I have a soft spot for their debut, but other than that they were clearly uncomfortable in the studio and less than the sum of their parts. Deadheads often ask each other what the best version of a certain song is. The answer is never \u201cThe studio version\u201d. Every single song they ever recorded was topped by a live version, usually dozens of live versions. So I\u2019d give the title of greatest band to the Rolling Stones based purely on the fact that they were the second best album and second best live band. Their sixties output is scattered with some of the best pop rock of the era and their incredible run of masterpieces (Let it Bleed, Beggars Banquet, Sticky Fingers and Exile on Mainstreet) is a run of brilliant albums that no other band has matched. Their work for the rest of the seventies was a step down but still outstanding. While it\u2019s true their recorded output wasn\u2019t as good in the eighties and nineties as it was in their prime, there are still a lot of gems there. They haven\u2019t recorded anything as good as Sitcky Fingers since 1971, but to be fair, nobody else has either. Unlike the Beatles, they improved their music when they took it out onstage. Their live shows were incredible, Jagger is the greatest frontman in rock and roll and the only person on the planet who could steal attention away from Keith Richards. While their studio output isn\u2019t what it once was, their live shows are still outstanding and a ferocious representation of the quality of their back catalogue. Sadly their live albums were generally poor representations of their shows and were usually made up of overdubbed tracks cobbled together into an experience that wasn\u2019t a good representation of what he crowd enjoyed. Thankfully they have recently started to release archival live shows in full which showcase how good they were. If Brussells Affair had been released as a live album at the time it was recorded, instead of decades later, it would top Live At Leeds as the most highly regarded live album of all time. I hope the Stones have another great studio album in them and finish their career on a highpoint. 2012\u2019s Doom and Gloom shows they can still write an oustanding song and an album of that quality would be an excellent note to finish their incredible career on.

            "answer_text": "Well, a question like this is impossible to answer with absolute certainty( maybe because it\u2019s subjective;) ) but I\u2019ll add my thoughts on it. From Rubber Soul onward, the Beatles catalogue is a treasure that will forever. Their music is something that always lifts my spirits, regardless of my circumstances. If you study their music, you\u2019ll learn about some of the remarkable things they did with their sound and their songwriting. For anybody even with a remote interest in rock music, I highly recommend looking into how the Beatles wrote their songs. It\u2019s a fascinating journey. I have to mention The Rolling Stones. While I believe a lot of their stuff is very mediocre, I can\u2019t deny the fact that they were an absolute driving force back in the day. I watched a documentary describing the Rolling Stones sound as \u201caudible testosterone\u201d, a description I fully agree with. But when I think of testosterone, I imagine seeing someone speeding down the highway listening to \u201cImmigrant Song\u201d or \u201cWhen the Levee Breaks\u201d. While Zeppelin is primarily known for fist-pumping head bangers, their modest acoustic songs are, in my eyes, just as important to their legacy. While the Stones and Zeppelin are commonly the first bands to come to mind when thinking of classic rock and roll bands, The Who represent everything that makes rock and roll great. Their famous stage presence combined with their diverse range of songs make them legendary. They\u2019ve been rockin\u2019 with each other for a while now, which is pretty remarkable in and of itself. Then there\u2019s Floyd. I can always rely on a chill Gilmour solo to raise my spirits, for he is the sage of guitar gods. Roger Waters, while not having the best public image, is a brilliant songwriter. They are one of the few bands with lyrics that really pierce your soul. Listening to \u201cNobody Home\u201d compels me to start acting like an actor in a musical. Lastly, I\u2019ll mention who is perhaps my favorite of the bunch, The Doors. Jim Morrison was a guy with the perfect balance of sophistication and flare. He is one of the few who naturally just compels you to start singing. What\u2019s more, the group really knew how to JAM. I\u2019ve always been impressed with their musicianship, and I still tend to get lost in the instrumental jams they did when I\u2019m listening to them. Oh, I almost forgot about R.E.M. . This group could do it all, from euphoric rockers to beautifully melancholic ballads. I\u2019m gonna come out and say that Michael Stipe is the best vocalist of all time. Is there anyone else who is as masterful at adapting his voice to the song as he is? I think they rival the Beatles when it comes to really taking your imagination on a joyride. ",

            "answer_text": "This is gonna be unexpected from me, since this band has not transferred over to my generation by and large, but I\u2019m all in for Jethro Tull. I know what you\u2019re thinking: 1) Who?? or 2) Pshh, you mean that weird band with the flute and the guy who dresses like a 19th century horseman? Precisely. And that man in question is Ian Anderson, who served as vocalist, flutist, and acoustic/rhythm guitarist for the band for its entirety (1967\u20132014). Here he is:  This guy is one of the best musicians in rock music. Not only did he write great lyrics and sing well (for the first 20 years, anyway), but he also played a whole plethora of instruments for music he composed almost singlehandedly. In addition to the instruments I mentioned, he also played keyboards, bass, mandolin, bouzouki, saxophone, and even occasional drums in the studio. The guy can do it all, as he showcased by steering the band through different genres such as blues rock (late 60s, early 70s), Progressive Rock (early-mid 70s), hard rock, folk rock (late 70s), and then 80s prog and hair type stuff (first and second half of the decade, respectively), before kind of simmering down to more progressive stuff in the 90s. This is why Jethro Tull is so great- how many rock bands do you know that have changed their sound so much over their time, and have done it amazingly? Of course, it isn\u2019t ALL because of Ian. He had a great partner in crime in this guy:  This is Martin Barre, the longest-lasting member of the Jethro Tull family besides Ian himself. Martin joined in 1968 to record their second album, Stand Up, and lasted until Ian fired him in about 2014. His guitar style moved gracefully with the genre changes, and he nailed them all, even (and especially) the heavy, hair-metal kind of stuff in the late 80s. This man is criminally underrated as a musician, I think he\u2019s better than Jimmy Page and Tony Iommi and guys like that. He lasted most of his career in Ian\u2019s shadow, but his guitar work is unparalleled. Thanks to these two, Jethro Tull easily clears the others.  ",

            "answer_text": " The greatest rock band of all-time? Easy. Led Zeppelin and I\u2019ll tell you why they are the greatest. I understand Zeppelin is the choice among many for the greatest rock band of all-time, something of a favorite or a choice people who really don\u2019t know anything about rock music pick, I think the fact that so many choose Zeppelin solidifies their greatness. The simple fact of the matter is that picking and choosing who is the GOAT is reserved for the general public, music writers rarely give such opinions and the musicians themselves are rarely a source of truth as they all somehow believe they are the greatest. With that being said, I believe that Zeppelin is the greatest because of three reasons. Their popularity has remained throughout their fifty year existence. Arguably they are more popular now than they were back in 1968. Don\u2019t just put this off to bandwagon fans, although I am sure there are quite a few. Zeppelin remains popular for a reason and I believe that reason is their music. Just like the Beatles remain popular, so does Zepp.The quality of their music. Arguably, Zeppelin produced some of the finest sounding music ever. I don\u2019t know if it is because of the sound recording techniques which Page used, but when you listen to Zepp\u2019s music, there is a sound produced which isn\u2019t like anything else.The songs themselves. Zeppelin wrote some incredible songs. The plagiarism stuff aside, Zeppelin wrote music which is still be used and highly desired today, the fact that it was used in a Marvel movie last year movies this point.Of course, these are just my reasons, entirely subjective.

            "answer_text": "Queen or Led Zeppelin. Guys put Opera, Funk, Reggae, Metal, Folk, original Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll, Blues, Jazz, Hard Rock, Aretha Franklin-kind of songs, classical music, etc etc. All the members were absolutely the best at what they were doing, during recording sessions Queen invented the Tape Delay effect used widely today. It has been scientifically proven like a year ago that Freddie Mercury is the greatest vocalist of all times, they measured the sonic speed of how he could jump from taking a very high pitch note (one of the highest in the world) down to totally different singing style, they actually measured the physical state of his throat and lungs, there are people with wide vocal ranges of course, but they are not even artists, random people from youtube with the similar vocal apparatus traits. But those findings just added a lot of love among the fans and brought thousand of new ones. Robert Plant\u2019s vocals are unique, even now, his singing is momentary recognizable, he has I think top 5 unique voice that universal, skilled and sweet to the ear. Freddie stands somewhere there too. Both bands had a certified engineer, John Deacon actually put up from different radio parts the Vox amp for Brian May that he still uses on stage (one row of the amps or more is fake, empty, this has been done to fine-tune sound on the big venue). John Paul Jones from Zeppelin is kind of a magic man, he plays bass generally, but on the Stairway To Heaven live performance he has this organ with the legs keyboard just like on big church organs, and he plays the two keyboards parts, he plays his bass part with legs, \u2014 he just uses all of himself to play music, and has been constantly inventing stuff. Both bands musicians are sharp individuals, starting from John Bonham who unfortunately passed, who is still recognized as one of the best drummer in the world, to Brian May who actually doctored his guitar from god knows what pieces of junk, he borrowed his mom\u2019s blouse buttons to make fret marks, it has a complex electronics, and around 15 years ago Gibson started manufacturing this \u201cRed Special\u201d guitar that was and is a hit on the market. Brian May never played any different guitar but acoustics. Queen guys, their line-up never changed since they became Queen, they\u2019d play scrabble on their tour buses, when other rock stars were drowning in whiskey pools and choking on cocaine and dying of idiotic behavior. There were parties of course, but that was not the lifestyle. Led Zeppelin started working earlier a bit, so there were parties because they were the first along with The Rolling Stones, the real fandom (not mania) started to grow up in the audience, but everyone always managed to get to the venue on time and play their best. Well, Jimmy Page screwed up on stage a couple of times in the late 80\u2019s or it was early 90\u2019s, that was funny:) I think it is very important that each member of any band are approximately the same social level, I mean education, the families they descent from, those people wouldn\u2019t invent punk, and even if they did, they\u2019d ignore that because there are so many more interesting things like orchestral arrangements, soundtrack production, trying different things. The latter was the most important for Queen, \u2014 surely for Freddy, who between recordings managed to take part in a Royal Ballet, and just causally told the other guys that he is dancing in that avant-garde play, where he had to sing a song being held upside down, the piece of that got into the \u201cI Want To Break Free\u201d video. I could actually go on and on and on about those two, but I have to answer the question! So \u201cWhy\u201d \u2014 see above. \u201cWho\u201d \u2014 Queen. ",

Couple that with their creativity and willingness to experiment, and it\u2019s difficult to top them.The Rolling Stones \u2014 they gave the electrification of American blues mass appeal and added an element of danger that that Beatles didn\u2019t particularly trade on.The Who \u2014 the pioneers of the rock concert not just as music, but as a show. Between Townsend smashing his guitar, Moon blowing up his drum kit, Daltrey twirling his mike over his head, and Entwistle keeping it all together while being a demon on bass, they even showed Hendrix a thing or two. Speaking of whom\u2026.The Jimi Hendrix Experience \u2014 because Hendrix broke the barriers of what an electric guitar could do.The Velvet Underground \u2014 all too unheralded and they weren\u2019t around long, but they pioneered the concept of rock as a visual art form which led to Pink Floyd and prog rock, and explored subject matter most others wouldn\u2019t. Their debut is hypnotic, even to this day.Led Zeppelin \u2014 the quintessential hard rock band; their debut was noticeably heavier than anything that came before it, and that\u2019s not an exaggeration. They made Seventies rock what it was.Black Sabbath \u2014 more than any others, the inventors of heavy metal. Metal bands still tune down to this day because of Tony Iommi.",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m an admitted music novice, including when it comes to the overwhelming (yet comparatively brief compared to other genres) history of rock n roll. There are quite a few bands that I\u2019m simply not familiar enough with to consider, despite how great I\u2019ve heard that they are (i.e. Metallica, Led Zeppelin, U2, and many others). That being said, here is my highly personal and entirely subjective rankings of, if not the best bands, certainly my favorites. The Beatles - Nothing to be said, really. Simply unparalleled.Radiohead - The greatest musicians of the modern age. This band has made some of the most emotionally powerful stuff I\u2019ve ever heard, creating a great sense of existential anxiety and distance that, if you let it in, can become beautiful and warm and comforting, like being told you really aren\u2019t alone. Their early stuff is great, but it really is Kid A and after is just on another level.The Velvet Underground - Second only to Bob Dylan, Lou Reed is my musical and especially lyrical hero (despite being an apparent misogynistic racist shit-bag in real life). The heroin shot of The Velvets in the era of love and LSD was like throwing an electric piranha in a bowl of stoned goldfish. But to compare them to a carnivorous fish is to ignore their sweeter, equally gorgeous side, the side of \u201cI\u2019ll Be Your Mirror\u201d, \u201cPale Blue Eyes\u201d, \u201cCandy Says\u201d and other classics.The Clash - Punk rock is often labelled nihilistic, but if there is any band to prove that stereotype wrong it\u2019s this one. If I need a pick me up, a good dash of social unrest personified, or just a light at the end of a tunnel, I go to this band. There is not band more idealistic and committed than The Clash.Nirvana - This has been a recent fixation for me, but I think they are certainly worthy of being in the conversation. No one gets teen angst like these guys (the closest second might be Violent Femmes) and to be able to get across such misery and anger without seeming like they\u2019re faking it or coming through as whiney or melodramatic is an achievement in itself.Honorable Mentions: The Pixies, The Kinks, Sex Pistols, Talking Heads, Bob Marley and the Wailers, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, The Strokes, The Beach Boys, R.E.M.

            "answer_text": "The Beatles. The whys are answered here on nearly a daily basis. If not for the Beatles there would unlikely have been any other huge bands. Bands such as the Rolling Stones would not sound as they do to us as they would not have progressed past the blues they began with. The British music Invasion probably would not have happened so most of us wouldn't even know who those bands were. The Beatles were responsible for the influence and inspiration of most of the musicians of their time and since. They were at the forefront of most of the musical genres we listen to today. They were at the forefront of fashion. They conquered the whole damned world without firing a shot but by singing a few songs. They went from being mortals to immortals and their musical legacy has reached mythical proportions. They were four of the most talented individuals to ever come together in a band and had four of the most diverse personalities and yet complimented one another perfectly. The songwriting team of John Lennon&Paul McCartney is considered to be the greatest songwriting team of all time. Most bands have a frontman The Beatles had three. They had two of the greatest vocalists of any band in Lennon and McCartney. They had a third great vocalist and songwriter in George Harrison. Richard Starkey aka Ringo Starr was a great drummer and a pleasant vocalist. They had what most other bands didn't, a deep love for one another that never diminished even after the roller coaster ride ended and the bubble burst. No one at the time compared with them. No one ever will.    ",

            "answer_text": "Oh, hell. I guess it depends on how you define greatness. Probably financially, longevity-wise, and the continued quality of the shows, all things considered, I\u2019d probably give it to the Stones, in spite of the rough patches. If you\u2019re talking about creating a fairly tight and devoted fan base, the Dead probably pulled that off. The Beatles probably get it for moving pop music closer to fine art (and we\u2019re talking Rubber Soul /Revolver until the end) than anyone else, and for practically inventing a new production aesthetic. The Beach Boys, and let\u2019s face it, I\u2019m talking about Brian Wilson, are also up there in the revolution of studio craftsmanship, and I probably would say Steely Dan gets a nod for taking cues from both of those groups and becoming so dictatorial in the studio that engineers still use those recordings to EQ auditoriums. Now, if we\u2019re talking about the Big Bang that was the creation of the whole genre, even though Elvis was the breakthrough point and the world would forever in one way or another view the world of rock and roll through Elvis -colored lenses (if you don\u2019t believe me, just compare the cover of the first Elvis LP with the cover of The Clash\u2019s \u201cLondon Calling\u201d), I think Little Richard wins the prize as a performer, as an innovator, and planting so many seeds that bore the fruit of so many sub-genres: Motown, Soul, funk, immediately spring to mind, but there\u2019s not a country-rock piano player, nor heavily made-up glam rocker, or outlandish showman (looking at you, Marilyn Manson) that doesn\u2019t owe the man a debt. I spent a little time thinking about including some music from a later time period than I have used in this particular analysis, but with only minor deviations, these artists created the templates of modern music, and I imagine that those people who freaked out about Public Enemy in the \u201880\u2019s could not have been more freaked than the average American seeing Tina Turner shake it during prime time in 1968. I also realize that I didn\u2019t include any female artists except for Tina, and for that I can only offer the limp but true excuse that women, though always a (usually undervalued) presence from Elizabeth Cotten to Diana Ross to Joan Jett, have had to fight their way onto trails that they often found had been credited to others, often under the (ugly) assumption that female performers were little more than pretty dolls wound up to play by and for men. This is certainly not the case, but I\u2019m sure that any feminist reading of the history of Rock and Roll will rightly point out that it was, and sadly to some extent still remains, a boy\u2019s club in the popular imagination, if not reality.

Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \"rock and roll\" in the USA in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the UK, the US, Canada and Australia. Musically, rock centres on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass guitar and drums.Typically, rock is song-based music usually with a 4/4 time signature using a verse-chorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse.Rock places a higher degree of emphasis on musicianship, live performance, and an ideology of authenticity than pop music.Rock is best played at volume 11I have listed just few examples that I think demonstrates \u201cRock\u201d as a genre. Voodoo Child (Slight Return) - Jimi Hendrix Helter Skelter - Beatles The White Room - Cream Whole Lotta Love - Led Zeppelin We Wont Be Fooled Again - The Who Can\u2019t Me Knocking - Rolling Stones Now I\u2019m Here - Queen Barracuda - Heart Back in Black - AC/DC Welcome to the Jungle - Guns and Roses Love Spreads - The Stone Roses Enter Sandman - Metallica Killing in the Name - Rage Against the Machine Come As you Are - Nirvana 7 Nation Army - White Stripes Rock music - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "The Beatles - They changed music, forever. Love them or hate them, they took us from soft, country-esque sound to hard rock, in 6 years. No other group has been as influential and prolific as they were. Led Zeppelin - The band that defined what being a rock and roll band should be. If it\u2019s Tuesday, this must be Belgium. They filled stadiums, sold albums, didn\u2019t bend for commercial needs, and they stand as musical giants some 40 years after their last album. RUSH - The musical geniuses from Canada. Every album has been platinum. As a trio, they have the world\u2019s best drummer, one of the best bassists ever to touch a string, and a grossly underrated guitarist, simply because he shares his stage with legends. Pink Floyd - Piper at the Gates of Dawn through The Final Cut - they embody what it is to be progressive rock. A band defined by their sound, who\u2019s members had been nearly anonymous throughout their career. Dark Side of the Moon stands as one of the best selling albums of all time, with an unprecedented 1630 weeks (31 years) on the charts, with 937 weeks (18 years straight) as a top 200 seller. The Jimi Hendrix Experience - It\u2019s hard to overstate the influence of this band. They are the quintessential hippy rock band. Jimi changed what it meant to be a guitarist, and their catalogue of hits is impressive. These folks, in my mind, are the absolute giants of rock and roll. Nobody else comes close. While there are many other talented musicians, or famous bands, nobody else can claim the influence on music that these 5 can. ",

They have many hit songs; They may have failed to evolve with the times, but that doesn\u2019t stop them from having one of the largest sets of songs played on commercial radio, of any band, indicating how strong they are ( Just ignore boring songs like Satisfaction and instead listen to Paint it Black, etc.)U2; So many great songs and so many hits; One of the most famous \u201csocially conscious bands\u201d; But I put this in as a whim, I don\u2019t expect much agreementAerosmith; Ok, not the greatest rock band ever, perhaps; But one of the greatest American rock bands; They had a ton of hit songs, and reinvented themselves a few times; Toys in the Attic is still impressive to me, and when people are patting Guns and Roses on the back for Appetite for Destruction\u2019s hard edge sound, just listen to Toys in the Attic!Not the Beatles; No way, not for me; I grant the many reasons people will put them #1, and hell, there\u2019s good reason to do so. But I find them boring for the most part, which is the opposite of why I like rock & roll; They are more pop than rock to me, whatever that means; I grant songs like Day in the Life are great in a way, but not in a rock and roll way; not to me",

There is also a difference between recording and performing bands. I am a huge fan of Deep Purple, but I\u2019ve seen some footage of concerts that were not always riveting. Led Zeppelin were a very successful and magnetic live act. The Beatles were immensely relevant in writing and recording but had a relatively short \u201clive\u201d presence in their recording heyday. The Stones alway entertained. Pink Floyd recordings and concerts have a huge atmosphere. AC-DC were one of the most phenomenal bands in concert I\u2019ve ever seen. I\u2019m not a huge Queen fan, but they were a superb mix or recording and performance presence. I love the Beach Boys\u2026 some immensely wonderful music, largely via the genius of Brian Wilson. Are they a rock band? Special honourable mentions: \u2022 Free (recordings and live, check the Isle of Wight festival) \u2022 Jethro Tull \u2022 Yes \u2022 Little Feat \u2022 Doobie Bros \u2022 The Who. An awful lot will come down to how old you are! And who influenced you most. If I had to be purist, and use \u201crock\u201d as the prime delineator, Led Zep might be ahead by a nose\u2026..as many of my other fave bands are probably not entirely \u201crock.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "There are way too many ways to answer this question. First of all, let's assume you mean English-language rock music, an assumption based on the language and placement of the question.  And we'll presume that \"band\" precludes any solo artists, including those that perform under a band-like moniker (like John Ondrasik's Five for Fighting or Trent Reznor's Nine Inch Nails). I guess the question behind the question here is what defines being the \"best.\"  Makes the best music?  Most influential?  Biggest impact? For technical skill, I'd probably lean towards bands like Rush, Yes, Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, Dream Theater, and Van Halen, and between those I'd probably have to choose Union-era Yes, based on sheer band member numbers, but I'm sure plenty of people could construct well-argued alternatives.  For example, a very compelling argument could be made for a band like Queen, which combines skilled musicianship with otherworldly vocal talent. For collective musical talent, it's hard to find a more impressive group than USA for Africa (\"We Are The World\").  With Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Hall & Oates, Michael Jackson, Smokey Robinson, Tina Turner, Ray Charles, Harry Belafonte, Willie Nelson, Dionne Warwick...the list goes on and on.  Though you could probably make a similar argument for Bob Geldof's Band Aid (\"Do They Know It's Christmas\"), as well as Artists for Haiti (\"We Are The World 25 for Haiti\"). For overall talent (musical and non-musical), I'd probably choose another celebrity supergroup, Voices that Care (\"Voices That Care\").  Besides the (by comparison) modest list of vocal leads, the supporting choir includes the likes of Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky, Magic Johnson, Tommy Lee Jones, Whoopi Goldberg, Meryl Streep, and dozens more highly talented celebrities (though it's not clear whether they actually all performed on the song itself).  You could probably still argue for both USA for Africa and Artists for Haiti under this criteria as well. This is the point at which things take a decidedly Beatlesesque flavor. For album sales, The Beatles win hands down, having sold more units than  both of the next two bands on the list (Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd)  combined.  For impact, creative breadth, longevity, and influence, it's hard to  argue with The Beatles - which is why they're the most commonly given answer to this  sort of question.  For half a century the Beatles have been widely accepted as the root of modern musical influence, and even those that argue alternatives always have to argue against The Beatles, essentially disproving their point.  (That said, the followup meta question -- but who influenced The Beatles? -- is fairly interesting, as the most obvious band to do so is The Beach Boys, who could be said to have driven The Beatles to ultimately become the super-influential band they were, and were a pretty talented bunch themselves.) In terms of popularity, The Beatles likely top the list again, both for height and longevity.  There have been crazes to rival Beatlemania (New Kids on the Block, anyone?), but no group has equaled that level of success.  (Well, perhaps Michael Jackson or Elvis, but alas, neither qualifies as a band.)  And the Beatles are still revered today, in a way that borders on musical religion. But finally there's the big one: who makes the best music?  Sure, I could go down the path of trying to qualify which band's music is better than all others, but I really feel like the answer is whoever's music you like most right now.  Musical enjoyment's underlying subjectivity means you like who you like.  Whoever manages to give you the best version of whatever it is you like, for you, is the best band ever, even if it's They Might Be Giants one day, Two Door Cinema Club the next...and One Direction when your 10-year-old niece is over. So the answer is The Beatles...maybe, but probably not, depending on what you mean by \"best,\" and who you're asking. Hope that clears things up for you. =) (reposted from What is the best band of all-time?) ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s my answer on why it\u2019s (drum roll \u2026) The Beatles: Thomas J. Beaver's answer to Why are The Beatles considered the best music artists of all time? Start with this: The Beatles had 30 #1\u2019s (singles) and 34 (additional) Top Ten hits. In 1963\u201366, a span of four years, The Beatles had 18 #1 albums in at least one country (the US, UK, Australia, Germany, France, or Canada). A unique feat. From the 13th of February, 1964 through May 9th, The Beatles held the Billboard #1 spot for 85 consecutive days, one song after the other. A unique feat. In April 1964, the Beatles had all five of the Billboard Top Five singles: Can\u2019t Buy Me Love, Twist and Shout, I Want to Hold Your Hand, She Loves You, and Please Please Me. A unique feat. In 1965, when \u201cTicket to RIde\u201d went to #1 in the USA, it was the 7th consecutive #1 single (US charts) that was a Beatles song. A unique feat. Musically, in 1963\u201364 they brought the Chuck Berry/Little RIchard \u2014 combines with the Everlys \u2014 style of rock to the US audience. Then, with the help of producer George Martin, the \u20185th Beatle\u2019, they led the pop world into becoming more and more avant garde, particularly in the 1966\u201367 era. John Lennon and Paul McCartney broke through as the best songwriting duo around, and probably (arguably) in history. Once George Harrison developed into the top songwriter he became as well (circa 1967), The Beatles had three elite songwriters in one band \u2026 a unique feat as well. I could go on and on \u2026 but that\u2019s a good start. ",

Biased towards higher prices in recent years - a single Stones stadium show at $200 a ticket can do better than an entire Beatles national tour. Even \u201cnumber of tickets sold\u201d is biased - Beatles at Shea Stadium could only fit 50,000 people in the venue, while larger stadiums today can crowd in 100,000. And then you get free open-air concerts where you get 1 to 3 million people listening, and Woodstock 69 where 30,000 tickets got sold but 300,000 people showed up\u2026 Number of albums sold? Things get skewed - \u201cFrampton Comes Alive\u201d was an OK album, but sold *way* more than its quality would have predicted. Number of singles or albums that hit the top 10? There\u2019s tons of major classic rock bands that never hit the top 10. Hell, even Led Zeppelin only had *one* single ever hit the top 10. Amount of popularity compared to other bands in their era? The word Beatlemania was invented for a reason. Amount of popularity 20 or 40 years after they did their music? See Rolling Stones. :) (And today I saw that Judas Priest announced their 50th anniversary tour for next year\u2026.) Amount of impact on contemporary artists? A band called Van Halen released a single called Eruption back in 1978, and pretty much every other guitarist on the planet said \u201cWait, what?\u201d Amount of impact on other artists that came later? Poster child here is Robert Johnson, who you probably never heard of because he recorded 29 songs in crappy mono sitting in a hotel room somewhere in Texas back in 1936 and 1937. And I can probably come up with some other definitions, like \u201cthe bands I listen to the most now\u201d and \u201cthe bands I\u2019ve listened to the most over the past half century\u201d and \u201cthe bands I most like to listen to\u201d And yes, there\u2019s a difference between \u201cbands I listen to the most\u201d and \u201cbands I like to listen to the most\u201d - when you\u2019re spending 8 hours a day in a cubicle farm with music on to drown out office noise, Tangerine Dream is a better choice than something like Ramones that\u2019s likely to get you singing along with it\u2026 :) ",

            "answer_text": "You won\u2019t get a straight answer from anyone for the following reason. Your question is one of a moving target. There have certainly been many extremely good rock and roll acts, but they are all reflections of a particular time and place. People today seem to look at the sixties like it invented rock and roll when all that happened was there was a major social upheaval across the country that was reflected in the popular musical expressions of the moment. Rock and roll has been a fulcrum if you will, a place where people seem to put all their focus, expecting it to represent some kind of definitive cultural statement. However, that is never going to happen in this country for one simple reason. Popular music for the last hundred years has been dominated by commercial interests, and anytime money defines a cultural expression it is instantly tainted and no longer an accurate reflection of society. This has happened countless times and thus you can really only comment, and only subjectively, about any particular greatest rock group at any point in time. There for, although the Beatles changed the face of rock and roll popular music along with, and no less than countless other groups that were more or less prolific, you really can\u2019t say that they were the greatest rock group ever anymore than any other group at any other time. Of course the Rolling Stones are very good, but so were The Yardbirds. This kind of speculation is like trying to \u201cprove\u201d that Charlie Parker was a better saxophone player than Sydney Bechet. They were both superb, both successful and famous and performed music that reflected different generations of musical audiences. Music is a snapshot of what is going on socially and always has been. Before the sixties period, and overlapping with the fifties were producers with stables of songwriters and performers like Phil Spector, who was far from the only one. If we switch the question to classical cello players it was thought for a long time that Pablo Casals was the greatest cello player in the world, but then Yo Yo Ma was not performing yet, at least not for the size of audience he has today and I would dare anyone to try to make the comparison. In the final analyses this kind of argument is like the Olympics where some athlete performs some activity in a quarter of a second faster than someone else so they get the gold medal. Are they actually the best? I would argue that there is more to being the best than that. It looks to me like quite often an awful lot of people are the best in any given field. There is no band that can accurately be given that title in my opinion because the question does not allow for such a rigid answer to be given. ",

Now, if you want my personal favorite rock band, that\u2019s a whole different matter. But to assume my personal favorite is the absolute greatest of all time, when there is not an absolute standard for measuring something such as \u201cmusical greatness\u201d, is absolutely foolhardy and cocky. Which is why I would word this question completely differently. But I\u2019ll answer about my favorites. Stryper is probably my first all time favorite. By first, I mean, first in chronological order, not necessarily favoritism. Stryper is a Christian hair metal band and they undoubtedly had an influence on me in my younger years and today. They looked like other bands I liked, and they were Christian like me and made songs I liked. As time passed, I\u2019ve grown less into Hair Metal itself, but I do not believe I will ever completely move on from it. They were and still are a band, they had all the original members back for a while, but unfortunately some different things caused them to have to part ways with their bass player, and now one of their guitarists has recently had a seizure and is recovering. A really cool side note is a Hair metal band called W.A.S.P. I wouldn\u2019t recommend going back and listening to any of their older stuff, as it\u2019s not exactly appropriate in any way, however the reason I mentioned them is their lead singer became Christian and is now producing very Godly music, which is such a super cool thing! As they say, there is unimaginable rejoicing in heaven every time someone who is lost comes back. My favorite band today would probably be A Day to Remember. They aren\u2019t really Christian, but I love their music and they are pretty responsible as far as bands go. They inspired me in many ways musically and remain one of my most loved bands. They are what got me into singing and screaming music. I\u2019ve never been too much for all screaming music\u2014 I enjoy contrast and different moods and dynamics more than an all out continual beatdown\u2014 but I can respect and get into some of it. I do shy away from the stuff that gets stupidly violent or obscene, though. That doesn\u2019t seem particularly healthy, to me. There are different ways of thinking about it, but I guess we have to be careful our \u201crelease outlet\u201d doesn\u2019t become the very validating source of our fetishes. If you like 80s or 2000s electronic music, or Pop-punk, or just energetic music, I recommend The New Cities first album Lost In City Lights. Every song on that is just so melodic and catchy to me, I love it a lot. They went WAY more electronic and pop on their next album, but this first album is really cool, just enough guitar to be awesome to me, perhaps it reflects the changes in popular music landscape, at one point the pseudo punk (whatever you wanna call it, no offense intended) thing was popular, but then popular music kinda switched a little bit more towards total electronic dance for a while. Now it\u2019s like in-between, today. But also a lot of rap type things. Now you can go and find someone else who likes the total opposite of all these bands. Have fun, Ya\u2019ll! Blessings ",

            "answer_text": "If it comes down to 5 choices, I think this is a less controversial question than meets the eye. I don't agree with Charlie Cheever w.r.t. several of his \"strong-case\" suggestions (Phish, Radiohead (band), Queen, Yardbirds, Aerosmith (band)). No way these bands have a shot at the \"greatest bands ever\" title. And I don't agree with the relativist suggestions that... no answer is the right one; the answer depends on taste; it's a splintered set of choices; etc. In my opinion, you have to play stadiums to qualify for this list, which I believe includes: BeatlesU2 (band)The Rolling Stones (band)Led Zeppelin (band)The Who (band)Of this list, I feel that The Who is the most vulnerable to displacement.  Potential alternatives for the #5 slot include: Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band (per Jacob Sommer)Grateful Dead (band)Pink Floyd (band)RushThe Clash (band)The Jimi Hendrix Experience (per User)I wouldn't pick any of these four bands for my list, but I believe that each has a meaningful plurality of fans who would support them over The Who.    I also have a personal fondness for Nirvana and Metallica, but neither is a serious contender for the Greatest of All Time title. ",

            "answer_text": "Joy Division. I know this is not going to be popular, but Joy Division deserves a place in the top 5 I don't know what the best rock band of all time is, but Joy Division is arguably the most relevant band to rock music today, particularly for alternative and indie rock (which is basically the only interesting thing happening in rock today) Joy Division started was started in Manchester in 1976 by Ian Curtis. What John Lennon was to Liverpool, Ian Curtis was to Manchester. Their most famous song is \"Love will tear us apart\". Curtis suffered from Epilepsy and killed himself in 1980 in the eve of the band's 1st American tour.  Ask any musician involved in indie or alternative rock and they'll cite Joy Division as one of their favorite bands. Among others, the band heavily influenced and is one of the favorites of: - Robert Smith, The Cure- Bono, U2- Dave Gahan, Depeche Mode- Sid Vicious, Sex Pistols (Curtis was also influenced by Sid and a concert of the Sex Pistols inspired the formation of Joy Division)- Bloc Party- Red Hot Chili Peppers ...and many, many others. Moreover, the surviving members of the band, formed New Order a few years laters, another brilliant band that gave us songs like: Ceremony, 1963 or Bizarre Love Triangle. If you have ever seen a Sophia Coppola movie, you have heard New Order.  A lot of the most exciting current bands like Two Door Cinema Club, Bloc Party (if the keep themselves together) or Russian Red are direct heirs to Ian Curtis. Pearl Jam is the other big band I'm missing here ",

This Australian band was political punk, rock, dance, had a 7-foot tall bald-headed lead singer, played live shows that were the stuff of legend. These guys never compromised. They never pandered, never sold out to corporations. They never got so big that they wouldn\u2019t drag some equipment out to a rural area and mix it up with the poor, and play a show for them. Or play atop a flatbed trailer in front of the Exxon building in New York. They were not progressive in musical style but they were still pioneering and inventive, musically. I saw them play twice in Michigan and was blown away. They remain one of the most well-reviewed, most respected acts on Earth. Their music was fire and fury. They embodied rock music, at least in my estimation, better than any band. And I have heard a lot of bands.

            "answer_text": "Most if not all answers here refer to well known bands, and I\u2019ve seen quite a few of those, but if we\u2019e talking about live music, then the place to hear and see it is not in the huge stadium, but somewhere a little smaller. That usually means seeing bands on the way up, on the way down or those that few people outside a city of nation have ever heard of. Bands on the way down can sometimes be just a little depressing, especially if there are few or even no original members, and can come across as a tribute band to themselves; and not a good one at that! That\u2019s not always the case of course! Most bands that have been doing the bar and small venue circuit for years range from okay to bloody awful with a few very clear exceptions, but most of the best live performances of bands I\u2019ve been to see are of those who appear to be on the cusp of something. The band is tight, the songs are good to brilliant, the atmosphere is electric and sweaty, and you go home and remember it for months or years afterwards. I had such an experience purely by chance! In the mid-eighties I had arranged to meet a friend in the student bar of the Camberwell School of Art, a place I\u2019d never been before, and was looking forward to an enjoyable and probably drunken time in a visually arresting environment; all recalling my own student days. I was in for a surprise. The bar was black. The walls were black. Everyone in the place except me was dressed in black with black hair and white faces. The Goth ethos had taken over the Camberwell student body that year and I felt just a little out of place! I bought a so-so but cheap beer dispensed via a black pump and settled down in a corner to await my friend. I was ignored by everyone. Who is that weirdo everyone seemed to be saying, or maybe that was just my growing paranoia. I waited. I waited some more, looking at my watch. Callaghan was nearly an hour late. I was nursing my beer, unwilling to spend more money in such a depressing place especially as I was sitting there alone, and when the hour struck I\u2019d had enough. \u201cSod Callaghan, I\u2019ll go somewhere a little more comfortable,\u201d I thought to myself, and knocking back the remainder of my beer and stalked out. I learned later that Cal had met with some sort of disaster he\u2019d had to sort out (Cal met with disaster quite frequently!) and this being pre-mobile days he\u2019d not been able to contact me. I wandered down Camberwell Road in the direction of Camberwell Green, the old town houses that had been converted in to flats and bedsit and the cheaply built council flats looming over me in the gloom of the inadequate street lighting, and wondered what to do next. At that time in London the live music scene was fairly kicking and there were numerous venues all over. On Camberwell Green was a small pub called the Father Redcap which at that time was an excellent live music bar. A few years later it junked the live bands and replaced them with DJs, and the last I heard was it had junked the DJs and was back to being a sleepy late 19th Century boozer. I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s still open, but I can tell you that around 1985 it was a place to go! I had no idea what they had on that night and whilst they more often than not booked good acts you couldn\u2019t rely on it, I was prepared to be disappointed. I squeezed through the door in to the totally packed and smokey interior. The first thing I saw above the crowd on stage was this crazy looking guy wielding a washboard and sporting a pink Mohican descending from what must have been a serious leap in the air. He was playing that washboard furiously and singing like motor oil and honey flowing over broken glass. A strange way of putting it, but you get the idea: the guy could sing; and he had presence! He was flanked by two guitarists, both long-haired, grungily dressed, and menacing, swapping lead and rhythm, and behind to his left was an even more menacing figure with a shaved head, psychopathic eyes that drilled the audience, turn-up jeans and enormous tattered hobnail boots, who leaned forward threateningly as he thunked away on a tea chest bass. Behind them all was a tall black guy with an array of percussion instruments which he beat the hell out of, but was always on the nail. The whole band managed to be impossibly tight and exciting, totally assured on the stage, and the crowd was going wild. I described them in a review at the time as being like a cross between the Rolling Stones and Dr Feelgood, only tighter, but this doesn\u2019t really cover it. They did originals and some very originally arranged covers, there was a country and jazz influence in there and even rockabilly, and they were, when it comes down to it, not like anything else, just themselves. The Gutter Brothers. You\u2019ve probably never heard of them, so I\u2019ll fill you in. They started as a busking band in London\u2019s Covent Garden, honed their act and started playing the venues. They released a couple of albums, the first originally only on cassette, and were soon in some demand to provide songs for soundtracks for TV including a long forgotten but quite good British sitcom called \u201cGone to The Dogs.\u201d They did lots of amazingly good and well attended live gigs and it looked like things were really going to start happening for them, but somehow it never did. The band broke up and the singer returned to his home in New Orleans and everyone went off and did other things. Meanwhile their small output of recorded music continued sell despite the fact that it was not being promoted at all, especially after it became available online, , and they remained a good musical memory for many, especially around London. A few years ago the tea chess bass player, Dennis, he of the psychopathic eyes but who turned out to be a perfectly pleasant and civilized chap off stage, died and the remaining band members attended his funeral. Having met up again and being aware that form their online sales they still had some sort of fan base, they thought they might do a few gigs. These went down so well that they now do a short tour each year, usually to packed houses. Some of that old magic is still there, but it was in the 80s that they were at their peak and it\u2019s a great pity that almost nothing of those gigs has been recorded. For this question I hunted the net and found a few very badly recorded videos from the 80s that do them no justice at all, and some footage of the band since they started performing in their new incarnation which is a little better recorded but still doesn\u2019t fully show why they were such a wonderful band. I finally found this video which is clearly recorded in someone\u2019s home studio and, whilst it can\u2019t really communicate what the band were like on stage in the 80s, it was the best I could do.  Going back to that night in the mid-eighties hen I first saw The Gutter Brothers, I was rather pissed off with Cal at the time for standing me up, but I ended up thanking him for inadvertently giving me the opportunity to catch the band for the first time. In fact I think Cal was one of the people I took to see them the next time I saw them. ",

They made brilliant music together, wrote incomparable songs, affected the musicians who were contemporary to them and those after them.

They were a phenomena, a force of nature if you will impacting everything and everyone in their path. What a barren landscape musically and more the world would be if the Gods hadn't put John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Richard Starkey into each other's path.

            "answer_text": "Hopefully, I don\u2019t go too crazy with my teenage fangirling here. This is a long one, so scroll down to the bottom for a quick summary. In my opinion, the greatest rock band of all time is: Sleater-Kinney.  Image Credit Left to right: Carrie Brownstein, Corin Tucker, Janet Weiss For those of you who have never heard of this wonderful band, Sleater-Kinney is a punk band from Portland, Oregon that formed in 1994. Over the years, they have released eight albums. Sleater-Kinney is the best rock band for a ton of reasons. Firstly, they know how to shred. As they have no bassists (2 guitarists and 1 drummer), they come up with some really interesting riffs. An example of this is in the song \u201cWhat\u2019s Mine is Yours\u201d, from their 2005 album The Woods.  Secondly, they aren\u2019t afraid to talk about their emotions and show vulnerability in their songs. Some \u201claddish\u201d bands avoid doing this as they think they will come off as \u201cweak\u201d or \u201cless masculine\u201d. Sleater-Kinney aren\u2019t weak: they are fierce. An example of this is their song \u201cOne More Hour\u201d, off their 1997 album Dig Me Out. This song is about the breakup of Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein, where both of them let out their feelings. Think of it as a punk version of \u201cDreams\u201d by Fleetwood Mac. They also aren\u2019t afraid to be angry and badass in songs such as \u201cEntertain\u201d and \u201cCall the Doctor\u201d. Thirdly, they aren\u2019t afraid to touch on serious subjects. Their song \u201cCall the Doctor\u201d is about conversion therapy. Their song \u201cPrice Tag\u201d is about being a mother in poverty. Their song \u201cWhat\u2019s Mine is Yours\u201d is about being gay in a small town. Their song \u201cJumpers\u201d is about the increasing number of people killing themselves by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge. Their song \u201cEntertain\u201d is about bands reuniting just for nostalgia\u2019s sake. The list goes on. Finally, they\u2019re consistent. Unlike some other rock bands, Sleater-Kinney have managed to have a consistently good discography while doing something new each time. After reuniting in 2015, the public thought that they would make a mediocre album. They didn\u2019t. They ended up making No Cities to Love, an excellent album that talks about the struggles of fame and motherhood. TL;DR: Sleater-Kinney is one of the best rock bands because of their amazing riffs, their \u201cno BS\u201d attitude, their lyrics, and their consistency. If you like Nirvana, you will probably like Sleater-Kinney, as they come from the same Pacific Northwest punk scene. If you like Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth or Patti Smith, Sleater-Kinney demonstrate the same level of badassery. ",

ALL unique. deadheads collect recordings of top live shows.. some of which were STUNNING. The 1977 Show, Barton Hall, Cornell U\u2026..is amazing. You don\u2019t NEED to get stoned.. it will transport you. The Dead, the WHOLE\u2026.went from mid 60\u2019s to mid 90\u2019s, and that does not count side projects, post Jerry stuff\u2026 which is significant. i\u2019d note Garcia, Neil Young, Clapton, Jorma are all GREAT electric or Acoustic. i saw Floyd Live (surround sound) on the 1970 + 71 tours. WOW. Probably would say Animals, Wish you Were Here were their most refined. The Stones\u2026 have been GREAT forever. My only Stones show.. Altamont\u2026..was FREAKY ( fk the Hells Angels) but was dramatic. saw Neil Young in MANY variants,\u2026\u2026ALWAYS great. Neil lived maybe 30 min up the road, so, he liked to play \u2018surprise\u201d local shows and.. those were AMAZING i got to see Janis (1967) Marley (1978) and Jefferson Airplane Late 60\u2019s,early 70\u2019s\u2026\u2026wish they lasted longer. I missed on Jimi, the Doors, Traffic. Among \u201cnewer bands\u201d\u2026 Dave Matthews band is who i most hope to see. ",

            "answer_text": "The Beatles.  They started out as a typical rock and roll band in western Europe, playing in dive bars, but they constantly reinvented themselves and their music throughout their time together the 1960's.  They were the trend setters that all of the other bands followed in terms of musical style, recording techniques and appearance .  Their music can still be heard everywhere from classic rock stations to doctors office waiting rooms.   During their heyday, they were central figures in creating the youth culture.  Before the Beatles, the recording industry was focused primarily on the adult market.  Beatle-mania was a game changer.  The focus quickly turned away from grownups to tap into this newly affluent group of teenagers, thereby opening up the door for the other bands that followed.   Their influence on modern culture went far beyond the music they created.  They were soon elevated to the lofty status of oracles for fashion, politics, religion and recreational drug use.  Anything the Beatles showed an interest in, whether is was long hair, the anti-war movement, Eastern religion or LSD, quickly became part of the international lexicon.   We are still feeling the reverberations of that influence today.   Think about it.  Four young working-class lads from Liverpool England form a band and manage to turn the world on its ear in the span of a decade and leave their mark on history for generations to come.  How improbable is that?  The term \"Beatles 4ever\" isn't wishful thinking, it's simply a statement of fact.  Legendary indeed! ",

            "answer_text": "My nomination? Def Leppard. It's certainly one of the most underrated bands of all time, but if you look at what they've accomplished it's easy to see why I think they're number one. They sold out almost every concert they played oftentimes setting records for how fast they sold out the venue. Mind you that these aren't nightclubs - they're football stadium sized arenas.Between Pour Some Sugar on Me, Rock of Ages, and Photograph, it's pretty hard to not know at least one song.Most bands have one or two hit singles per album. 1983\u2019s Pyromania had three. Which was followed up in 1987 with Hysteria which had, well, seven.Due to the success of the two aforementioned records, Def Leppard is one of just 5 rock bands to have 2 different records reach Diamond status in the USA (that's 10 million copies)Def Leppard is one of just two bands where I could sit down and just listen to any album from cover to cover and enjoy it. I can't do that with the Beatles, Pink Floyd, Queen, Led Zeppelin, or The Rolling Stones. Def Leppard is about as consistently good as they come.So yeah, Def Leppard earns my vote. ",

            "answer_text": "If I were to go into the typical, mostly objective reasonings of what the best rock bands ever are, I\u2019d need to name the likes of Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, etc. Howver, the answer I'll give you is simply my personal opinion. Deep Purple has always been one of my favorites for their variety and distinct sounds different from any other band I know. I also feel that they have no filler songs. I can listen to most of their albums from 1975 and prior all the way through without finding a song that seems lower quality from the hits. Perhaps an unoriginal opinion, but Machine Head in particular is one of those album that absolutely does not have a filler song. Also a huge fan of The Zombies. Similar band to The Beatles but with a more manageable discography. They have similarities to The Beatles in their catchy songs, poetic lyrics, variety, and harmonizing. Like Deep Purple, few to no filler songs in my opinion. Last band I'll mention is Yes. Excellent progressive rock band. Again, no filler songs, at least in the good albums. Yes was instrumental in its genre and tried some new things and did some weird things that ended up working really well and creating some epics, like, of course, Close To The Edge. Hope that answers your question a little. It gave me a chance to geek out, at least. ;-) ",

            "answer_text": "There are many legendary rock bands.  The one that tops them all is debatable.  I would personally say the most legendary rock band would have to be the Rolling Stones.  There are millions of stories to be told about the Stones since their inception in 1962 to the present day.  The Rolling Stones have played in dozens of countries around the world and have a history of performances across decades in music history.  They have been credited with influencing many entertaining and exciting artists throughout the years.  Their stories are legendary, one of my favorites is during the 70s when they would be dropped out of helicopters and land on the stage and proceed to bring the house down with their classic hits.  They have dozens of hits that are mainstays on Rock stations in America, Europe, and around the world.  In 1975 they announced their tour of the Americas by playing a free concert in New York City on a flatbed truck to surprised onlookers.  During their height in the 80s The Rolling Stones played the biggest venues in America including the Superdome in New Orleans, JFK Stadium in Philadelphia, and the Cotton Bowl in Dallas.  In my honest opinion, there will never be a band as legendary as The Rolling Stones. ",

            "answer_text": "Pink Floyd - Their run in the 70\u2019s is the best by any band ever, probably followed close by 80\u2019s Metallica. When you pump out 4 albums in the space of a decade which 2 of them are considered among the best of all time but the other 2 are considered by some as better than the other 2 then you\u2019ve had a pretty decent run. Go past the 70\u2019s and they put out The Final Cut which is criminally underrated, some of David Gilmours best Guitar Solo\u2019s and Roger Waters best song writing. Roger Waters Leaves and there\u2019s no stopping them. David Gilmour puts out 2 albums which may pale in comparison to their 70\u2019s albums but are amazing in their own right. They then put out one of the greatest love albums of all time in Pulse. There\u2019s certainly a certain level of Bias as I have listened to and loved Pink Floyd for over 20 years now (I\u2019m only 28), but let\u2019s not let that take away from the fact that they certainly are the greatest band of all time, period! The Wall is the greatest album of all time, Comfortably Numb is the greatest song of all time and the Guitar Solo at the end of Comfortably Numb is the great Guitar Solo of all time. I haven\u2019t mentioned anything pre-DSOTM or The Endless River. Pre-DSOTM there\u2019s not a great deal of upside, there are a few decent songs like Echoes and as far as The Endless River goes it\u2019s pretty great in it\u2019s own right but it has nothing on everything else I mentioned.

The amazing energy, the light show, the superb musical skills of all members, just has never been surpassed by any other concert I\u2019ve seen. Led Zeppelin STILL are 2nd in album sales for a group (the Beatles are first). This despite having broken up almost 40 years ago. They nearly broke the Internet in 2007 when the world heard there was to be a reunion concert - 20 million people competed to become one of 2 million included in that raffle (I was one of the 2 million but alas not one of the 2000 that actually got tickets).

The most innovative? I\u2019m tempted to say the Beatles, but I don\u2019t think they were really a Rock band. The trouble with that category, \u201cinnovative\u201d, is that it immediately disqualifies most bands we would think of as Rock bands. As you might have noticed, this list so far hasn\u2019t mentioned any US bands except the Eagles. It\u2019s slightly curious, in that, a lot of my taste in other musical genres is decidedly American. I certainly concede that Steely Dan and Frank Zappa were innovative, but, are they Rock bands? The greatest heavy metal band? Probably Metallica, though I certainly got a shock when I downloaded their version of \u201cSo What!\u201d, thinking it was a jazz number. I bet nearly everybody who attempts this is Male. There\u2019s something about the male psyche that just loves lists. I think \u201cpeace and love\u201d is a good motto when we discuss our musical tastes and we should just enjoy the music which we like and leave everyone else to listen to enjoy their choice. I draw the line at rap though. ",

I personally go through phases. I regard the Beatles and the Stones as pre-eminent for reasons based chiefly around their great songs and their position as the creators of rock music as it is today. I regard Joni Mitchell with the LA Express as the most accomplished musical band ever. This is because of the great songs, enormous sophistication and playing skill exhibited on their albums Court And Spark and Hissing Of Summer Lawns. That said at any time I could be listening to say Elvis Costello, Neil Young, Julian Cope, The Beach Boys, The Stranglers, Small Faces, Buffalo Springfield, Public Image Limited. I love all these outfits and much much more besides. And I frequently listen to soul, reggae, jazz and folk too. ",

Others, Queen and more recently U2. A lot more great bands in the second tier, The Doors, The Who, CCr, Eagles, Deep Purple,ACDC, Sabbath etc. Third tier has hundreds of bands, Rush, Metalica, Van Halen, Kiss, Bon Jovi, GNR, Journey, Foreigner, Def Leppard, Scorpions, etc. Others in slightly different genres, The Stooges, Pistols, Nirvana, The Cure, The Smiths, Radiohead, now it gets to the stage of a lot of great bands but not quite in the same league as those at the top. Individual artists, well theres Bowie, and Springsteen, Jimmy Hendricks of course. And plenty others just down a tad, Meatloaf, Joe Cocker, Alice Cooper, and so on. Even a lot of my personal favs, arent gonna make this list, The Cult, Alice In Chains, Soundgarden, Dishwalla, Cold Chisel(great aussie band). Yeah, I think if your being really objective the top of the list pretty well stays the same, its just as we get further down then it becomes more subjective. Btw, Ive probably missed out one or two really obvious choices by accident. ",

When sphagnom core broke up three of the members went searching for a new front man, after interviewing many contenders in a long weekend event called \u201cLegendfest\u201d they chose the enigmatic icon of the Unanderra underground scene, Laz Lightning. He gelled straightaway with Big Tone, Marky D and Mud ( sticks) McClure and the Gun club was born. Their sound was a fusion of Nirvana, Kyuss, Silverchair, AC/DC and Engelbert Humperdinck rolled into a massive chorizo. If you are lucky enough to have original copies of limited release songs, Totally wild, Hallowed or Day after a crime, you basically have your superannuation needs sorted!!. This frantic foursome developed a cult following with Sunday sessions in the \u2018rarge packed to the rafters with like minded souls. Just like the greatest of meteors that blast across the heavens, they too, eventually burnt out. This was no surprise to those who had followed them, the hard rocking, hard partying way they were living would have tested even the best of the more \u201cwell known\u201d deity\u2019s of the demon life we call rock and roll. Why should this relatively unknown band be so revered and go down with the greatest bands in history ?, it can be summed up with just one simple word\u2026\u2026.because. ",

Here\u2019s my top 5. Enjoy :) Grunge Rock - Nirvanacuz I had to! Nirvana is the band that got me through my rebel years. Why? Kurt Cobain (center in pic) portrayed pain like it was pleasure, and that death can be beautiful if you\u2019re willing to burn out than fade away.  2.Alternative Rock - Rdiohead For starters, Thom York with his falsetto is a dream angel. Some of the band\u2019s best songs IMO are (How to Disappear Completely, Lotus Flower , Just). The most powerful song of this band, I feel is Paranoid Android.  3. Psychedelic Rock - Pink Floyd I\u2019m gonna be honest here and say that I was waiting to include this band in one of my answers. These guys are classic, the Gods of Guitar, the BEST!! Besides, these guys have nice hair (uhm\u2026 Thom York had nice hair too. It must be the age now so\u2026 yeah!)  4. Glam Rock - (late) David Bowie He wasn\u2019t exactly a band, but I thought I might as well include him since this man put the glam in glam rock.  you see all that make-up? it\u2019s better than most girls can get right on Halloween. i\u2019ll just go ahead and add his makeup-free pic-  5. Reggae Rock - The Police This band caught me with it\u2019s hit single - Roxanne. It\u2019s quite impossible to not get hooked onto it since the first listen. The group disbanded in the late 80\u2019s sending a lot many fans heartbreak.  ",

Here's my thoughts on some of these \u201cbests.\u201d \u201cBest live rock band\u201d goes to the Who by an eyelash over the Stones, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Queen, and Hendrix. I can make an argument for any of them (especially Purple, my personal favorite), but the Who were absolutely phenomenal live in their Keith Moon years. Hearing Daltrey live doing his primal scream at the end of \u201cWon't Get Fooled again\u201d enduces quintessential rock mania and goose bumps. In that moment, rock doesn't get any better. \u201cBest rock group in studio\u201d is clearly the Beatles by a significant margin. They invented the concept album with 'Sgt. Pepper,\u201d and their amazing songwriting skills were on full display in the studio. They made it not just OK but advisable to use a variety of non rock instruments on your album. Props also go to the Beach Boys, Pink Floyd, Yes, but the Beatles win this one. \u201cBest Rock Musicians\u201d to me (acknowledging my bias) is Deep Purple. Few bands had 3 virtuosos as skilled as Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord, and Ian Paice. The improvisations that Blackmore and Lord threw back and forth were both cerebral and visceral to an amazing degree, which is why their live concerts were so amazing. Cream is a very close second (they were jaw dropping in their skills) but I prefer Purple because of Lord's Hammond, which gave an additional (and largely unique) texture to the music. Also worthy of mention are Zeppelin, Yes and (surprise) Beck, Bogert and Appice - 3 vastly talented players. \u201cBest musical legacy/impact\u201d once again has to be the Beatles. They turned rock music on its ears and incredibly advanced the genre both musically and societally. Frankly, this one isn't even close. An amazing string of seminal albums, a seemingly non ending string of fabulous songs - and McCartney today is perhaps the most consequential musician living, regardless of genre. Yes, you can point to the Stones. the Beach Boys, and pioneers Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and Elvis Presley (musicians but mot groups) all of whom have significant legacies. But the Beatles remain supreme in their impact on the rock music world. There are certainly other ways to define \u201cbest,\u201d and countless other bands I haven't mentioned who are terrific. But this is my list and my thoughts on your question. ",

            "answer_text": "Nirvana  No one has ever changed music in the way Nirvana did. Nothing even close. They literally catapulted a genre into people\u2019s hearts without even trying. Sure, they didn't invent alternative rock. But as far as I'm concerned, they made it a genre. Before that, it was just rock without significant guitar leads and polished sound. Nirvana used Kurt Cobain\u2019s brilliant songwriting, blended it with fuzzy distortion, dirty drum beats, and explosive bass lines and shot it up the charts. Nevermind created the success of Pearl Jam\u2019s Ten, Alice in Chains\u2019 Dirt and even Green Day\u2019s Dookie. Today \u201calternative\u201d is an incredibly popular genre. Bands like Green Day, Fall Out Boy, Fun., My Chemical Romance, and Panic! At The Disco would not be multi-platinum selling bands without Nirvana. I own every Nirvana song ever produced, even live versions so I guess I'm biased, but it's for a good reason. From the sad compromises of \u201cServe the Servants\u201d to the goodbyes of \u201cYou Know You're Right\u201d to the angst of \u201cStay Away\u201d to the pure punk of \u201cOh The Guilt\u201d, Nirvana remains (in my opinion) as the greatest true rock band of all time.

All of their albums have gone platinum, and most of them are prog rock perfection. They had mainstream success in the 80\u2032s, and while they're not as well known today, they still are world famous. They have (in my opinion) three of some of, if not THE best musicians to have ever lived. The Bassist is also the keyboardist, and singer, and he could sing his guts out. The drummer is the greatest drummer ever. I'm not even going to hide my bias. He has done amazing things on a set, and even changed his style, as he was willing to improve and learned something from jazz drumming. Alex is a very underrated guitarist, and is a very capable player and emotive soloist, as well as an impressive technician. They have inspired many musicians, and touched the hearts of millions. For my money, they are and always will be, the greatest band, with the greatest music in the universe. ",

            "answer_text": "Okay, there's the greatest rock band of all time in the studio; The Beatles, and then the greatest live; The Grateful Dead. The Beatles.  Hard to argue against them, they built the foundation for experimentation in the studio and sought to stretch the limits of what could be accomplished there throughout their existence as a band.  They were able to combine experiment and success better than anyone ever has inside a studio.  George Martin deserves a lot of credit for this success.  I'd put Pink Floyd at number 2 in this regard. The Grateful Dead.  No other band has ever created a more solid bond between themselves and their fans than The Dead.  And it was their live show that did it, their studio work being of secondary consideration.  They put together a business model that is now being emulated by other bands all over the place.  A model based on touring rather than on a relationship with a record company.  The idea of never playing the same set twice, of allowing taping during a concert and an effort to keep ticket prices reasonable were all pioneered by The Dead.  I'd put The Rolling Stones at number 2 for a live act.  They mixed quality with durability very well. ",

They only released eight albums over an eleven year period and each one is a winner and features at least one must listen to track. They were the ultimate stadium rock band, watch the shows on their DVD called DVD, just magic. Their influence on other bands right through to today is immense and they have become the bench mark for every new guitar based band to be measured against. They are the kings of hard rock, but included lots of other music styles too. Their 5th album Houses of the Holy contains eight tracks everyone features a different music style including, folk, funk, reggae, progressive rock, blues, psychedelia and radio trending pop. ",

Seeing how music isn\u2019t really a \u201cmeasurable\u201d entity, you\u2019ll get who everyone\u2019s favorite band is. Along with why. Herein lies the beauty of music. Different things touch people in different ways. That in of itself is unmeasurable. Ok, my favorite? RUSH. Why? Well, they stayed together, intact for over 40 years. They changed their sound almost from album to album. Their level of musicianship is way above average! Their lyrics range from sci-fi/ fantasy to deeply philosophical. Their music complex and still catchy. But!!! What I think sets them apart from most others is their ability to recreated what they\u2019ve made live. All while putting on a visually stunning show! ",

            "answer_text": "My personal opinion is The Who. Some reasons: - They pioneered the rock opera and really pushed rock out of just short pop songs into something more epic. - I think Quadrophenia is the best album ever and the best rock opera. - Their catalog is really deep and really varied. - Amazing live performances (listen to Live at Leeds, for example) - Were important in the 60s, 70s, and 80s. - Their music has more replay value than other other rock band I've listened to (Radiohead is maybe the only one that's close.) I think some would make cases for The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, U2, Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, Queen, The Yardbirds, Radiohead, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Rush, The Grateful Dead, Phish, and Van Halen.  Some people into more obscure music might argue for Can. ",

            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: I consider The Beatles to be the most influential and important band in popular music whether we label it rock, pop or popular music. It's beyond doubt that The Beatles, The Who, Led Zeppelin, Cream and to a large extend Stones, Beach Boys and The Byrds all belong to the parnas of rock bands. Still, when asking for a 'legendary' band I think the answer has to come up with a band which has achieved more than sheer volume and popularity let alone direct impact on music history. 'Legendary' contains something mythical and 'against-the-odds' which defies popularity and success.  In this regard, I'd like to nominate the following three candidates for the most legendary rock band award: 1 - Velvet Underground for challenging the aesthetic parameters of rock; 2 - Fairport Convention for incorporating the traditional music heritage into the rock idiom;  3 - Magma for reaching beyond the given format by bringing the rhythm section at the core of the music. Some may ask whether these acts are actually rock bands and that's precisely the point. Rock has developed into a meta-phenomena in music through the help of legendary bands which are not confined to The Beatles, The Who, Led Zeppelin, Cream and to a large extend Stones, Beach Boys and The Byrds but also to Velvet Underground, Fairport Convention and Magma.

That moment reminded my why I loved him as much as I did as a kid. But of course Dire Straits is not the only favorite on my list I like a lot of bands and my taste is very broad from the Beetles and Rolling Stones to Dire Straits, Metallica and Alice N Chains and pretty much everything in between. The best live rock n roll bands that I have seen in concert were The Rolling Stones, Dire Straits, Def Leppard and Metallica\u2026Oh Metallica was the best metal concert I ever went to\u2026they opened with Fade To Black and their sound was amazing\u2026I sat in the very back in the grass and felt like I was in the front row they were that good\u2026the worst concerts were Guns N Roses, Poison and Aerosmith though I still like their music I will not go to another Guns N Roses concert\u2026Axl Rose is an ass to his band members and his fans and the concert I saw he showed up late and was shit faced and could not even sing or carry the tune to his own songs\u2026I walked out of that concert 20 mins into it I didn't even ask for my money back they were that bad ",

U2 would struggle to make this list and I love both of these bands\u2026 Led Zeppelin, The Who, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles. Pink Floyd, Rush and Queen\u2026These are some of your pioneers of rock music. Queen in my opinion, is being pulled into the first tier but most likely end up at the front of the second-tier. But maybe. I think there's a second-tier that would perhaps include Aerosmith, U2, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. Radiohead, along with Coldplay (who I have much respect for) who I also love, would round off that second tier. I have to also say, Crosby Stills Nash and Young is in here somewhere in some kind of way along with Hendrix. Man, the British Invasion ruled. This argument I think we would all agree, certainly with cement that in times place... Let's put it this way; every band I listed up above I could listen to continuously on a loop all day. Now, as far as the why? For me, since Music evokes feelings and emotions and memories, it just depends on what's going on in your life, the mood you\u2019re in, etc., etc., That, I think is the much deeper question... ;-)) ",

            "answer_text": "Sorry, this is kind of a bad question. By what standard? How could art possibly be judged so objectively that there could be a \u2018best\u2019? Take the advice of Afrika Bambaataa from his classic \u2018Looking For the Perfect Beat\u2019. In it, he describes himself and the Soulsonic Force as, essentially, a group of intergalactic musical anthropologists, cruising through the galaxies in eternal search of The Perfect Beat. And yet; he also says that this song is the perfect beat. He says you can hear the perfect beat by turning on the radio. He exposes a very Daoist view of art. Every work of art is beautiful in it\u2019s own moment. While sitting alone in a dimly lit room with a glass of wine, I might tell you the best rock band of all time is The Shangri-Las. While hanging in a dive bar, I might say any band Neil Young was in is the best rock band of all time. While dancing in dark room with strangers, I might say Soulsonic Force is the best rock band of all time. Two minutes later, I might say it\u2019s Cybotron, and five minutes after that Cyndi Lauper, and I would be right each time. If you absolutely require an answer, in my opinion the best rock band in history is Shiver. http://www.allmusic.com/album/shiver-mw0000017773 ",

Bands such as the Rolling Stones would not sound as they do to us as they would not have progressed past the blues they began with. The British music Invasion probably would not have happened so most of us wouldn't even know who those bands were. The Beatles were responsible for the influence and inspiration of most of the musicians of their time and since. They were at the forefront of most of the musical genres we listen to today. They were at the forefront of fashion. They conquered the whole damned world without firing a shot but by singing a few songs. They went from being mortals to immortals and their musical legacy has reached mythical proportions. They were four of the most talented individuals to ever come together in a band and had four of the most diverse personalities and yet complimented one another perfectly. The songwriting team of John Lennon&Paul McCartney is considered to be the greatest songwriting team of all time. Most bands have a frontman The Beatles had three. They had two of the greatest vocalists of any band in Lennon and McCartney. They had a third great vocalist and songwriter in George Harrison. Richard Starkey aka Ringo Starr was a great drummer and a pleasant vocalist. They had what most other bands didn't, a deep love for one another that never diminished even after the roller coaster ride ended and the bubble burst. No one at that time compared to them. No-one previously will.    ",

Why, first off every album I listen to is at least good they always made a more then ok album, and actually most of their albums if not all of their albums are in my top twenty albums of all time. I can go back and listen to it even their debut album with a different singer had songs I can rewind and listen to again. Second off their musicians are all equally great, and they can play any types of genres and the thing is not only did Dream Theater made me a metal head they also made me appreciate a lot of types of music and also one of my favorite guitarist John Petrucci plays in Dream Theater, and he is a awesome guitar player he can play really fast and play really great melodic guitar solos he inspired my playing in guitar, also my favorite drummer Mike Portnoy played in Dream Theater the drum solo in Finally Free is one of my favorite drum solos of all time, and in the opening in A Nightmare To Remember is one of my favorite intros of all time when he was using blast beats. Most importantly I just like their songs that's why I like them I like their singing, melodies, and their approach they're good at making it sound technical, melodic, and heavy. If I want to start a band I would like them to have similarities with Dream Theater not like a copy cat I would write originals just a similar approach. ",

Some better than others. What metrics would you use to figure this out? Technical skill? That\u2019s irrelevant for rock music. Album sales? Honestly, who cares? There\u2019s a ton of popular music selling millions of albums that sucks. Conversely there is a lot of music that only a small group of people have heard of that are amazing. Stop thinking like this. Music isn\u2019t about the best. It\u2019s not a competition. It\u2019s about individual expression. Get off your phone and go have some visceral experience, listen to everything you want to and find new music, see bands live, stay out late, whatever. Stop worrying about stupid things like who\u2019s the best. ",

I've said this before, The Beatles unlocked the door and Zeppelin kicked it in. The Blues, country, folk, reggae and Heavy Metal they played it all. Two studio musicians, John Paul Jones and Jimmy Page, who played on thousands of recordings and two country bumbkins. If we're going on popularity, they had their first 6 albums all in the top 200 at the same time. They broke concert attendance records all over. When they played the O2 Arena more 20 million fans tried to get tickets. They turned the pay of bands completely around from promoters to the acts. They didnt have a huge promotion department behind them. They didnt cut singles. Have cartoons or lunch boxes. The critics hated them. But what mattered the most, was the fans. They loved them. Zeppelin was a word of mouth thing. They didnt cut the 3:33 song. FM radio was born or AOR. They're my favorite band and who I think are the best. But that's just my humble opinion. Someone else will have their opinion and they'll be wrong ;) ",

Springsteen himself is surely one of the greatest songwriters and bandleaders in rock history. In concert, they manage to make a large band (8\u201310 people) sound as crisp, clear and tight as a small combo. Springsteen is as dynamic a live performer as you\u2019ll ever see. And they\u2019ve built a very large body of top quality studio recordings that can stand beside anyone\u2019s.  ",

I know many people will disagree with me saying that they play the same 3 or 4 chords and all their songs sound similar.And even though I'm a hardcore fan of Led Zep,G'n'R and the likes,nothing can beat the sheer energy that AC/DC create. Their songs are simple,catchy and crazy.Their lyrics are rebellious.Just watching the videos of their performances make your hair stand on an end.Rock'n'roll,according to me, is expressing yourself in a natural and the most energetic way possible and these guys do the best justice to that. Just type 'AC/DC Riverplate' on YouTube and see their videos.I just hope to watch them live someday. \\m/ AC/DC all the way \\m/  ",

            "answer_text": "This is truly subjective but I would have to go with the Beatles. An obvious choice in my mind. The Beatles literally invented what we now know as rock. The Rolling Stones, for one example, would never be who they were without the Beatles, and there are countless others. Another note, no one else in history produced as many hits in as little time as the Beatles. they were only active for around 7 years, producing 13 albums all containing hits, and most of them containing multiple hits. The pure ingenuity of the McCartney-Lennon duo is truly incomparable. ",

I realize that some of these selections stray from the one true way of Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll. But in an era wherein Rap \u201cartists\u201d are voted into the Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll Hall of Fame, a little fudge-room should be allowable, I hope. I was tempted to list some Reggae artists as well. A giant such as Bob Marley is, after all, rather hard to overlook no matter what the genre. Lucky Dube, Alpha Blonde and others deserve some mention as well, since they were not only influenced by, but influencers of Rock music. So, there you have it. Perhaps a bit ragged around the edges, but a heartfelt assertion of merit, by any measure. ",

PS: please don't ask why beatles is not in this list. :P  PPS: If the person is new to rock, my suggestion start with pink Floyd and Lynyrd Skynyrd. You may not appericiate the genius of Led Zepp at that time, i know i didn't.  Anyways happy listening. ",

I will try to keep all my recommendation within rock, hard rock and traditional metal, not sure if you like heavy music or no.

            "answer_text": "Great music is different from a great band. There were really amazing songwriters who changed the face of music and it's direction but a great band is when people of different individual talents come together and just kick ass. Although it's subjective, I would go with Led Zeppelin (Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, John Bonham) everyone of them was a surgeon with their instrument. Second close is Tool. Yea, MJ Keenan, Adam Johnes, Danny, Justin of course. I don't think i will ever see this perfect blend of talents. Even though I love 90's grunge band Nirvana, there has always been single creative force behind the band and a single songwriter. There are still a lot of bands with such unique sound as Zeppelin and Tool but that vibe is totally different. It's genuine and magical. ",

            "answer_text": "I will say the Beatles. Why? Were they the greatest/best musicians? No. But what they accomplished as a band, moved/changed rock n roll/music/recordings..broke the rules, added new rules that have become standards..pushed others to innovate explore as they did. Music in general was in the dull drums until they came on the scene and woke everybody up, they even changed hair styles , dress styles.. and that is history which we can trace back to the Beatles. Oh yeah.. lets not forget there great singing and song writing and playing abilities. This is not to say that there have not been some amazing bands, but they have not changed the scene and influence the music as the Beatles did. And that in my humble opinion is why the Beatles are the greatest band of all time. ",

            "answer_text": "I think this is a very subjective question, but it also depends on how you define \"the best\".  Some might feel the band that has sold the most albums is the best.  Others might feel it's the band with the most songs to hit #1.  And there might be people who think it's the band that puts on the best live show. I think we can admit that an inordinate amount of talent is not mandatory to create a great rock band...that's been proven. It's not a good indicator of how good/successful a band will be.  Preferably each band member would be skilled musicians, but that alone doesn't mean a band will be the best.  Attitude is important and goes a long way. Chemistry between the members is hard to define, but you know it when it's there and it can't be manufactured. All great bands have this. Keep in mind, band members don't have to like each other for there to be chemistry.   Two bands immediately come to mind...Aerosmith and Van Halen.  I have a hard time picking one over the other.  They both have been around a long time, they have very distinctive sounds, songs that have stood the test of time and can still tour to sold out venues. ",

Three of the greatest guitarists ever in the same band and for one song (\"For Your Love\") at the same time...Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page....although Page was a studio session player and not yet part of the group at the time, and different musician's tracks were recorded at different times.At least one of these three influenced every rock guitarist to follow.Led Zeppelin would have been named \"The New Yardbirds\", but other Yardbirds members (Keith Relf, singer, songwriter, harmonica player, Chris Dreja, guitarist, songwriter) objected.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Yardbirds ",

            "answer_text": "I currently think AC/DC is the best rock band of all time; my reasons include their originality, influence, their longevity and their ability to simply get down and  r-o-c-k rock. Also unlike other bands mentioned on this list, I consider their genre to be rock only and not a rock/pop/indie/prog/blues hybrid. Interestingly I hardly listen to them - maybe because their music is so ingrained in my psyche that I don't feel the need to.    And there are so many other more contemporary bands I know we won't be saying are the greatest rock bands of all time but I wish we were in some kind of alternate universe where they were (e.g. The Hives, The White Stripes, The Mars Volta, Queens of the Stone Age).

            "answer_text": "This is so subjective. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a greatest rock band of all time. Some may argue it\u2019s the Beatles or the Stones since they were the innovators of the \u201cclassic rock band sound\u201d and their respective music catalogs are over 55 years old. But there are so many great bands that emerged after the inception of The Beatles and the Stones. I personally love Van Halen (David Lee Roth era only), The Who, Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, AC/DC (Bon Scott era only), Queen, Journey, Elvis Costello and the Attractions, INXS and so many others. Some people like certain musicians in a band, the lead singer, the lyrics or melody of a song, etc. but it\u2019s all subjective. I tend to like more songs than bands nowadays, because a lot of bands today are relying on the way a song is engineered/recorded. Less bands are playing instruments and are relying more on synthesized sounds. ",

Consistently high quality sound and lyrics Biggest catalog of great music - Rolling Stones - I find their sound more exciting than the Beatles, and because of longevity, they have more total good songs than the Beatles. Most ardent fans - Led Zeppelin - I missed the Beatlemania of the 60\u2019s, in my experience no band has had the cult like following bordering of worship, as had Led Zeppelin. Their sound is likely unbeatable, they are only so-so on lyrics though. My personal favorite for relevance and style - The Who - Great and innovative sound, larger than life band members, deep and sensitive lyrics as well as hard rock anthems. ",

However, to have some fun with the question let\u2019s apply a different conceptual framework. In the Baseball Hall of Fame, there are some players who are there because their high points were amazing compared to their peers even if they maintained that extremely high level for a relatively short period of time (e.g. Sandy Koufax). There are other players who are in the Hall of Fame because they were very good for a very long period of time (e.g. Pete Rose). In football, there seems to be a clear Quarterback GOAT in Tom Brady because combination of a consistent very high level of performance plus longevity. The longevity condtion disqualifies the Beatles and many other aspirants. The Rolling Stones haven\u2019t released a good song in almost 40 years so they fail the consistently high quality test. If we combine the criteria of high level of performance and longevity, there is a clear answer. Neil Young and Crazyhorse. ",

Defining greatness is subjective, but objectively we cannot consider Radiohead either, due to a lack of musical ability. Possible contenders are Queen. Amazing talent, and amazing songs every so often, but irregular quality in terms of albums Pink Floyd. Alas they made The Wall. Yer man Dave Gilmour has done some very good recent concerts Pearl Jam. 30 years of underwhelming albums cannot undermine their debut. And in the recent Gigaton they have just recently produced their second best album in three decades. That is very impressive. Meshuggah. Is this rock? Certainly they kick ALL butt, although the live concert I attended was very poorly mixed Dire Straits. High quality! Finally, The Shaggs are years better than freaking Radiohead and The Beatles.

No band has or ever will come close to the Beatles. I suggest you do your homework. Paul McCartney has a solo artist, and forming Wings for a decade in the seventies, the since the start of the eighties has so many awards and so many number one songs from 1962 to today. No one else ever will ever be what he is. As a group the Beatles are number one. No more to say. Study your homework. ",

Billy Gibbons guitar chops are constantly ranked among the 100 greatest (I rank them among the 2 or 4 greatest at least), and Dusty and Frank provide some of the solidest rhythm support. They are excellent arrangers, promoters, and entertainers with great group chemistry. I recognize they are not in the same league as, say, Bruce Springsteen when it comes to being the Gods of Poignant philosophical musings but my boys can compose and belt out catchy, typically hilarious ballads about love, lust, automobiles, Texas, and most famously fashion ('cause ev-ry girl crazy 'bout a SHARP-DRESSED-MAN duuuuh dah duh day duh). There are personal reasons, too; ZZ Top was the first rock-and-roll band and among the first music at all I was ever exposed too; they're from the South, and I lived in the South; and I am a fan of their frontiersman, manly, Harley-Davidson riding image and lifestyle (don't worry, I like baseball and poetry and politics and plenty of other stuff too). So I'd say, in my book, ZZ Top is on Top. ",

Okay that is not why I chose him as the greaestt rock band of all time. The reason is in the late 50s he performed in London UK. A really obscure band from Liverpool heard him. It was the first time they heard American R&R. The band later became known as the Beatles. To be clear it was the group that consisted of John Lennon, Paul Mc Cartney, George Harrison and Richard (Ringo) Starkey. t was Gracie who influenced their bouncy, lively sound. For his was the first US rock and roll they ever heard live They loved the sound. ",

So I give my vote to the jimi hendrix experience just for the amount of change to rock music they brought without them rock music wouldn't be the same, although that can be said for many other bands too so basically this question is just a toss up.

They have recorded country (such as Far Away Eyes). Reggae (such as Too Rude). They have ballads (Angie). Satisfaction is one of the most well known rock song ever, and it captures that feeling of teenaged desire. I love Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, Floyd, Doors, Kinks, and many others, but the Stones stand alone. ",

Every one of those albums is still worth listening to. the variety of styles, from straight-ahead blues-based rock to skiffle. the live performances! No other band was nearly as much fun in concert.

Sounds ridiculous I know, but I'm willing to bet that 90% of current rock, indie rock and really any band with a guitar, can trace its genesis to some guy hearing Pavement play on a college rock station in the '90s and thinking, \"I could totally do that.\" ",

Along with this, they often experiment and you\u2019ll find that even one song is entirely different from another in the same album. To this point they could go under many different genres and subgenres. Plus, I also enjoy them for nostalgic reasons. Band Two: Alt-J One of the more obscure bands out there, I personally enjoy them for relating reasons; I\u2019ve always been into the weird and more experimental songs/bands. Band Three: The White Stripes I enjoy them quite a bit, plus their songs are catchy as hell. No specific reason why either, this is probably because of my widespread taste in music. ",

They have lasted so long, albeit in a few incarnations, and their musicianship is still very high. They have managed to meld together a wide variety of musical influences and genres, yet they have a recognizable sound. They have taken a lot of risks but are not a marginal/marginalized band. They have been a messy grouping yet they have pulled together time and again. You can hear their \u201cbig hits\u201d on rock \u2018 roll stations and indie stations, and find their music easily, and there is so much of it. They are not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but they have a huge following. And there are many other people out there who like some of their music. They have influenced so many musicians. I love their music. ",

First it would depend on the type of music you listen to, i listen to rock, metal, rap, blues mostly to rock and metal, then it would depend on when you really started listening to music for example i liked alot of music my parents listened to but in grade 5 i did a project with 2 guys in my class and they were listening to Metallicas Master of Puppets and that day i went home all excited because i heard this band that was so awsome after that i went through my dads vinal and the very next band i found was Guns N Roses and from there it just keeped going. There theres my first two legendary bands and just to name a few more i would consider in that group obviously Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, The Beatles, Motley Crue, Skid Row, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden but these are just some of the bands i listen to and think are legendary, someone who listens to more country might think differently.

The Angel's (Aussie rock band who were given a kick-start by AC/DC) - great fun, with an occassional hint of social comment. Queen and The Who - for all the reasons in the other posts and to different degrees all the descriptions for Tool & The Angels can be applied to their music. And of course The Who were the loudest band in the world for several years. If told I could only ever listen to one, it would be Queen for the range and variety of their music - and they still put on a great live show. There are great bands in the other comments, that it's hard to go past. ",

The band deserves such commitment. While most of their peers have fallen apart due to greed or laziness, Rush has maintained the same line-up since 1975 and their concerts are as spellbinding as they ever were. It's also beyond dispute that Neil Peart is the greatest drummer on the planet. They just wrapped up an epic tour where they played Moving Pictures straight through, and are working on a new album. Here's hoping that they bust out 2112 the next time out. It's the only way to top that last tour. RushFan4Life \\m/ \\m/ ",
