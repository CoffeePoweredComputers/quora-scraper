            "answer_text": "There really isn\u2019t an objective way to answer this question, as it will depend on personal taste\u2014and the genre of music chosen.

However, other people who listen to a great deal of classical music may well choose another composer\u2014Beethoven or Bach, for instance, and I would not be able to argue with them sensibly. ",
