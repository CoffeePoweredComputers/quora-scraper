(If you game)I suggest grabbing a RX 460-Rs 9500(If on a tight budget),if you can flex the budget a bit more buy the 1050ti Rs-13000. (If you don't game)Use integrated GPU until you an afford a dedicated GPU. ",

            "answer_text": "For the best price / performance ratio you should look at the 4th gen processor as the newer 6th gen processors require DDR4 ram (I know ddr3l is supported but it's hard to find a board for). But at your budget I would recommend bumping down to a Core i3 and upping your GPU budget. A good rule of thumb is Price of motherboard+CPU ~ Price of GPU. ",
