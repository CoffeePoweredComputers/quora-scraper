            "answer_text": "Maria Callas, arguably the greatest opera singer of the past century, was often considered fat by the people around her. She was, in her own words, \"heavy,\" though she claimed she weighed no more than 200 pounds. Here she is, playing the title character of Bellini's Norma before her weight loss:   (I don't see it...) When she was around 30, Callas lost eighty pounds over the course of little more than a year (1953-4). She said:  I was getting so heavy that even my vocalizing was getting heavy. I was tiring myself, I was perspiring too much, and I was really working too hard. And I wasn't really well, as in health; I couldn't move freely. And then I was tired of playing a game, for instance playing this beautiful young woman, and I was heavy and uncomfortable to move around. In any case, it was uncomfortable and I didn't like it. So I felt now if I'm going to do things right\u2014I've studied all my life to put things right musically, so why don't I diet and put myself into a certain condition where I'm presentable. Post-weight loss:  Some have speculated that her dramatic weight loss contributed to a decline in the quality of her voice. Fellow soprano Dame Joan Sutherland said:  It was a bigger sound in those earlier performances, before she lost weight. I think she tried very hard to recreate the sort of \"fatness\" of the sound which she had when she was as fat as she was. But when she lost the weight, she couldn't seem to sustain the great sound that she had made, and the body seemed to be too frail to support that sound that she was making. Oh, but it was oh so exciting. It was thrilling. I don't think that anyone who heard Callas after 1955 really heard the Callas voice. Callas singing \"Casta Diva\" from Norma:  ",

            "answer_text": "In the realm of opera, in addition to Pavarotti, often known endearingly as \u201cthe fat one\u201d, you also have Monserrat Caball\u00e9, also known as Monster-fat cow belly:  One of the most sublime vocal instruments of last century, hands down. Then you have some more females (yes hence the joke). Great dramatic American soprano Jessye Norman (God does auto spell hate her name\u2019s spelling!!!):  Her Verdi, Strauss and Wagner were stellar! A note: she did lose a lot of weight later in her career, enough to deserve losing the nickname, Just Enormous. Here she is a few years ago upon earning a Kennedy Center medal:  Another great soprano who lost a great deal of weight, but very early on in her career was the legendary diva, Maria Callas. Before she was 30 she looked like this:  but she lost the weight and in a year\u2019s time looked like this:  And this was in the pre-gastric bypass age!!! Smart career move, n\u2019est pas? More recently, noted British Wagnerian soprano, Jane Eaglen has lost some weight, but still she\u2019s not far off from this:  Yes, here she is as Turandot, the princess/goddess that men are racing to have themselves killed over. WTF?!?!? One female opera singer, California native Deborah Voight, perhaps the greatest active Wagnerian/Straussian singer, had tremendous success with her gastric bypass. As she has a beautiful face, this surgery really helped to keep her career strong. Here is a before/after pic:  Crazy, huh?! Nowadays, the push to have more skinny opera singers (for the sake of verit\u00e9) has pushed out many fine talents who have not been able to keep the weight off. ",
