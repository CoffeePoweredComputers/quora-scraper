            "answer_text": "My mother made me take piano lessons when I was 5 years old. After a few months, I had my first recital. I dressed up in a lovely dress, played a couple simple pieces, then bowed. People were clapping and smiling at me. At that moment I felt so pleased with myself, so proud of my performance. Immediately afterward, my mother and my teacher came up to me and asked me if I wanted to continue lessons. I, of course, eagerly nodded. How could I say no? Just a year later, I started regretting my decision. The pieces began to get harder. I had to practice more. There were more recitals that I had to prepare for. I had to memorise songs. Next, I had to participate in exams and perform in front of judges. The teacher started to get angry at me when I couldn\u2019t keep up. It was stressful. I hated it. I hated being forced to attend lessons every week, hated having to practice for 30 minutes a day, hated being yelled at by my teacher. I was a failure. I dreaded my weekly lessons and started to avoid practicing. There was no passion when I played. I had begged my mother to let me stop, but she kept reminding me that I had wanted this. That I had agreed to continue my piano lessons. So I continued taking piano lessons for 10 years. But after 10 years, I finally quit. I eliminated the high expectations, I eliminated the teacher\u2019s constant criticism. I eliminated the stress. But I didn\u2019t get rid of music. When I was about 9 years old, the high school orchestra came down to the elementary school to perform for us and let us try the instruments. I remember trying my best to play each of the instruments. Finally, I tried the viola. It sounded terrible, of course. I had no idea what I was doing. But the boy whose viola I was attempting to play just smiled. I\u2019ll never forget his words: \u201cHey, you\u2019re good! You should play viola.\u201d And so I decided I wanted to sign up for orchestra. I wanted to learn how to play another instrument. I wanted to play the viola. This time it was different. Everything about it was different. Because I could choose. I chose which instrument I wanted to play. I chose to attend viola lessons instead of going to recess. I chose to wake up an hour earlier than normal to attend practice. I chose to practice at home. I learned how to play the viola. I learned how to appreciate music. I was passionate. I made the choice. And that made all the difference. Make sure your son wants to learn how to play piano. If not, don\u2019t force him to do something he isn\u2019t passionate about. Help him choose something he actually wants to do and encourage him. ",

            "answer_text": "I regularly am asked if I will take a student this young, and always recommend waiting a few years until the child is 7ish. Here\u2019s why - it is no extra work for me, but it is a lot of extra work for the parent. At no time, will a child this young EVER practice on his own. You, the parent will have to sit with him for every practice. You will have to attend every lesson so you know what his teacher expects him to do. You will have to read the lesson out to him, remind him of the songs he has to work on, assist him in the placement of his hands, and you may even have to point out the notes as he plays them with a pen/pencil. Young children in the pre-reading years often have tracking issues (their eyes can\u2019t follow the notes across the page) so pointing to them and saying their names/counting as they play is often essential. This issue should pass in a few weeks to a month of practice. The day you stop sitting with your child at every practice is the day he/she will stop making progress. You can expect this to be true until about the age of 7ish. At the age of 7 you can tell the child to practice the piano (after homework etc) and reasonably expect it will happen. Although at that point you will have to schedule and ensure the child practices, but you can be nearby doing other activities while they work. At the age of 7 (usually) at NO TIME will a child leave their fun activity (friends, coloring, tv show, computer game etc) and voluntarily go practice! Okay, only the rare and unusually child will! Most will have to be wrangled over to the piano to practice and they will hate it and wish to quit. If you can stay the course with them, you can expect independent solo practice with no reminder or nagging from parents somewhere between 11 and 13. Been doing this a long time. Seen it happen many, many times. So the answer to the question is: He will practice when you make time to sit down with him at the bench, open the book and say \u201cNow Johnny, put your hands on the piano like your teacher told you\u201d Okay, now you play the first notes here - and say their names out loud with me!\u2026.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "At 5 years old, I\u2019d say your son is too young to be pushed into learning piano. I say this from personal experience as both my brother and I were pushed into learning piano from a very young age. The best way, in my opinion (as well as learning piano, I\u2019ve taught quite a few kids, although I\u2019m disinclined to teach anyone younger than 7 or 8) is to just encourage him by playing games with him at the piano. Get him to have a go at copying a simple melody that you play for him, things like that. Make it fun, and he\u2019ll be more interested in learning. ",

            "answer_text": "I asked my young son what would it take to make him want to practice. He told me he wanted to be paid to practice, 10 cents a day. So for 70 cents a week I agreed. He never missed a practice after that. I was there for his sessions. I learned to recognize various pieces, and would request certain ones. Neither my wife nor I have any musical abilities, we just enjoyed his playing, and actively encouraged him. He went on to play professionally. I guess what I am saying if you make it important to you it may become important to him. ",

            "answer_text": "Make sure that he is the one who wants to learn to play and not have it foisted on him by parents.  If your son really wants to learn the piano, set a consistent time each afternoon after school for him to practice. There is nothing wrong with allowing him the latitude of taking one day a week off from practice, but all other days must be fulfilled before doing anything else. Make sure that mixed in with scales and other pieces that he practices there is a selection or two that are his choice to play and get good at.  Be sure to praise this efforts especially as he reaches milestones in his efforts. ",
