That being said off the top of my head I know that (surprise surprise) the synthesizer driven \u201cwho are you\u201d is an Ozzy creation as is the synthesizer driven \u201cam I going insane\u201d from sabotage. I know Ozzy and Geezer wrote the lyrics to fairies wear boots together when they were high. Ozzy never wrote any other lyrics as far as I know. Who wrote the music? That\u2019s easy; Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward. ",

But all four guys in the band shared songwriting credit equally. After Ozzy left, he claimed credit for lyrics to certain songs, including \u201cParanoid.\u201d Butler was livid, saying \u201cOzzy didnt write nothing. He can't even read, so how could he write a song? \u201c What's the truth? Who knows? ",
