It was recorded for his self-titled debut album and quickly rose up the Billboard country chart , eventually peaking at number 8 in 1989. This song also directly led to another of his hits as it was hearing his name in the lyrics that caused former rodeo champion Chris LeDoux to introduce himself to Garth and offer to record a duet with him..that song turned out to be \u201cWhatcha Gonna Do With A Cowboy\".
