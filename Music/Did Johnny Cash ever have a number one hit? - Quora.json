            "answer_text": "Although he is in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Johnny Cash never achieved a number 1 hit on the Hot 100 Singles Chart. His biggest pop hit was A Boy Named Sue, which reached number 2 in 1969.  However, on the Billboard Hot Country Singles Chart, he managed 14 number 1 hits. He collected five in the 1950s: I Walk the Line and There You Go (both in 1956), Ballad of a Teenage Queen, Guess Things Happen that Way, and Don\u2019t Take Your Guns to Town (all three in 1958). He collected a total of 19 top ten country hits in the decade. Moving on the 1960s, Johnny Cash again reached the top five times: Ring of Fire (in 1963), Understand Your Man (in 1964), Folsom Prison Blues - Live and Daddy Sang Bass (both in 1968), and A Boy Named Sue (in 1969). He added 16 more top ten country hits to his total in this decade. There were three number 1 hits in the 1970s: Sunday Mornin\u2019 Comin\u2019 Down - Live and Flesh and Blood (both in 1970), along with One Piece at a Time (in 1976). He garnered 10 top ten country hits in the decade. Johnny Cash had only one number 1 hit in the 1980s: Highwayman (in 1985) as a member of the country supergroup the Highwaymen (with Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson & Kris Kristofferson). His only other top ten country hit in the decade was The Baron (in 1981). In addition to these totals, Johnny Cash added four top tens in duets with his wife, June Carter, and one more with Waylon Jennings. So the grand totals are 14 number 1 hits, along with 52 top ten hits \u2014 all on the Billboard Hot Country Singles Chart. I\u2019d say he deserves his place in both the Rock & Roll and Country Music halls of fame. ",

            "answer_text": "In the UK, the answer is, unfortunately not. The best he got were two No4 hits. First in September 1969 with  \"A Boy Named Sue\", and then in April 1972, with the the help of The Evangel Temple Choir, he reached the same spot with  \"A Thing Called Love\". It's extremely sad that his final recording  \"Hurt\" barely got into the Top Forty, stalling at No39. ",
