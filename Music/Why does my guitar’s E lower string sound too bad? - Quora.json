            "answer_text": "It's hard to say. This problem arises in many conditions like if the string needs to be changed, it is rusted, the tuning keys are displaced, the fretboard is bent, etc. If you play the string open then it may sound weird. You may try tuning the string to its position. If the problem continues i would suggest you to take your guitar to the store from where you had bought it. Explain your problem to them and they will help you out. ",
