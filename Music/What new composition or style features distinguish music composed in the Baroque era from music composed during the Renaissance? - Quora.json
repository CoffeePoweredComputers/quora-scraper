            "answer_text": "There are a lot of these, but a few important ones. Particularly, the ascendance of the use of solo voices over polyphony. This is when we start seeing a lot of pieces for one voice and an accompaniment that does not carry nearly as much musical interest on its own as, say, lute parts or keyboard madrigal reductions. Also, choral music that is homophonic rather than polyphonic starts appearing a lot. Next most important is the use of unprepared dissonances, and more free use of dissonances in general. Instead of having dissonances always prepared as suspensions or permissible as passing tones, in the Baroque is when we start seeing neighbor tones and escape tones. Also, the development of tonality, as opposed to modality, although there was sort of a stage in between that some theorists refer to as \u201ctriadic atonality.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "The Baroque era ushered in two major changes in thinking. The first being the tonal harmonic system of functional harmony as the basis of musical structure. That system introduced functional harmony, meaning that chords had specific relationships to one another and followed in specified orders and sequences. The introduction of functional harmony allowed for longer more organised types of forms and allowed for the harmonic development of ideas through modulation and sequencing. Functional harmony also allowed for the liberation of dissonance as an expressive entity. New kinds of dissonance were developed and used. The second major innovation of the Baroque era was the use of motivic repetition as the foundation of phrase structure and the repetition of phrase structure as the foundation of larger sections and the repetition of larger sections to become form. None of those developments could have happened without functional harmony as the basis. ",
