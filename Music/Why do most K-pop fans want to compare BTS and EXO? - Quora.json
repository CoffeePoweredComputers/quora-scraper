            "answer_text": "Naturally, people want to compare their faves to another group of the same caliber. EXO is a group that has dominated the Korean pop industry since 2012 with MAMA, as they\u2019ve been immensely successful with songs such as Growl in 2013. They\u2019ve won one of the most daesangs in history and are overall a force to be reckoned with. They were believed to be almost unstoppable. BTS started out pretty non-mainstream. Unlike EXO, they didn\u2019t have the benefit of a huge company with many successful bands already; most of Bighit\u2019s groups weren\u2019t making it at all. On top of that, they debuted with a hip-hop concept that criticized Korean society, ostracizing many people from their music. As such they were always the \u201cunderdogs\u201d, but began rising to the top especially in 2015 with I Need U. When they won their first daesang in 2016, that\u2019s when tensions began to rise between fans of EXO and BTS. I think BTS fans have this need to prove themselves and their idols, to an unhealthy degree. Yes, while many fans don\u2019t do this, a lot of the immature fans definitely attack EXO or go on EXO fan sites/videos and start leaving negative comments. Because BTS used to be an underdog group, the fans want to ensure that BTS stays at the top but also wants to pull other groups down. It\u2019s not all BTS fans though, EXO fans also do the same thing. But that\u2019s just because they\u2019re popular right now. BTS is definitely NOT an underdog group anymore- no one can deny that. They\u2019re probably the two biggest male group fan followings as of now in Kpop. They want to outdo each other constantly, so they compare the two groups. In terms of actual Kpop fans, not just BTS or EXO fans, it\u2019s probably because they\u2019re the most active on social media. You can\u2019t go anywhere without seeing BTS or EXO anymore (on Kpop social media) and fans constantly compare them, which is why they\u2019re always being put side by side with each other. TLDR; EXO and BTS are the most popular groups as of now, which is why people want to compare them. ",

            "answer_text": "Because our minds work like that. We think by ways of comparing things. It\u2019s how we gain knowledge, understanding, and wisdom. It\u2019s okay to compare things. But if its comparing like Oh shit boy but did Exo do (insert what BTS did that EXO didn\u2019t do), then yeah thats bad loololol. But if its just trying to understand who BTS is like or who EXO is like then yeah comparing is good. ",
