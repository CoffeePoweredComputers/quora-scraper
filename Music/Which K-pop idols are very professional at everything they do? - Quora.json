She always has slick movements and creates it so that nobody even notices - whether it\u2019s mic problems, outfit problems or just regular stage problems  In the rehearsals, the rest of the pinks just sing, some do 50% effort when it comes dancing, but Ros\u00e9 acts like it\u2019s the actual performance.   One time, BLACKPINK\u2019s background audio stopped working. the rest weren\u2019t sure, but Ros\u00e9 acted like nothing happened and continued singing, leader material. QUEEN   In the videos of BLACKPINK BEING PROFESSIONAL more than 50% of the videos are just Ros\u00e9   In Interviews, Ros\u00e9 always speaks and introduces the members, professionally, answering wittily. She saved Jennie once.  THE MOST PROFESSIONAL IDOL IN THE INDUSTRY ",
