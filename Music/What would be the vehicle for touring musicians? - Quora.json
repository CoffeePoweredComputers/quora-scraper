Dent along the fender and all. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re Tom fucking Araya, you\u2019re never too metal to drive one of these bad boys.

Yeah, the gas mileage sucks, and you\u2019re going to be thinking that the poor thing is either going to blow up or fall apart while you\u2019re driving it, but it\u2019s reliable.
