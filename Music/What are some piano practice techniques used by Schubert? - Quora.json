            "answer_text": "I am pretty sure nobody knows much about how Chopin, Mozart, or Schubert practiced. (I\u2019m surprised you omitted Beethoven. )The best one could do is to research the piano pedagogy texts that they might have encountered. However, it\u2019s an intriguing question. How did Mozart\u2019s pianistic style, with it\u2019s characteristic flowing melodies against arpeggiated harmony, evolve into Schubert\u2019s use of octaves and big block harmonies, a technique closer to ragtime than it is to Mozart? Was it the evolution of the instrument? Was it that Schubert had much bigger hands? Did Schubert learn that technique from someone else? Your questions could be the basis of a substantial research project. ",
