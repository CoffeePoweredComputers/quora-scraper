            "answer_text": "To reply to your query two things must be kept in mind Versatility & creativeness of the music composer.At least he / she has worked in more than 5 languages & is recognized nationally.Since India is a big country & there are a lot of music composers who are popular in their state but infact not known to the other part of India. It does not necessarily mean that his creation is of lesser weight age . A composer is an artist & should not be seen in this perspective. It is also true that a music creator may not appeal to all the generations as such , hence acceptability or popularity in a true sense bound to be dependent on the age & maturity of the listener. In my view one of the most talented music director of India is Salil Chowdhury due to the perfect blend of eastern ,western & indian folk music with a perfect combination and harmony though he is almost forgotten by the common people. Our favorite music maestro Illaiyaraaja was a guitarist in his orchestra & he had foreseen his talent during his association with him. Mr RK Shekhar ,father of AR Rahman used to conduct his arrangement in South Indian music & Rahman has expressed his influence on him. ",

            "answer_text": "In my personal opinion It has to be this man  VIDYASAGAR He is one of the best musicians in the South Industry and has also composed for Hindi films He is the guy behind this  And this  Being one of the leading composers in Malayalam and Tamil sadly he's not much talked about other composers like A.R.Rahman sir or Yuvan . He can give good melodies as well as upbeat Kuthu Paatu as well. ",
