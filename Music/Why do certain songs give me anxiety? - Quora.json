The only possible explanation for \u201cgiving you anxiety\u201d is the song reflecting back to you what is already happening in your mind. Blaming it on certain songs is a bit naive, my friend. No song will really \u201csolve\u201d your anxiety either..if this really bothers you then you should ask yourself what is really wrong. And how you really fix it. 20 years of anxiety+15 years of listening obsessively to music +10 years of playing it have taught me a thing or two, trust me.. ",
