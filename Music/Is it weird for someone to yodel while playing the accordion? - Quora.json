            "answer_text": "Well, for all the instruments you could play while yodelling, the accordion seems the most fitting. I mean if I try to think of yodelling and where it is done, I also associate many of the same cultures with some kind of an accordion-like instrument. So\u2026 yes. It\u2019d be weird but only because of the yodelling. If you are going to yodel (and it being weird is definitely not a reason not to do that) while playing an instrument, accordion is probably the least weird option there is. Besides: \"Somethings only not cool until you make it cool\" - Ed Sheeran Do it well enough and it\u2019ll be the coolest thing ever. Nobody will care if it\u2019s weird. ",
