            "answer_text": "There really isn\u2019t an age restriction on what age you can debut but it\u2019s typically not recommended to debut young. The Korean Entertainment industry is a very dark and physically, mentally, and emotionally taxing place to work in and and honestly not a good place for young teens or children. Plus being that young, I highly doubt you have the skills and training to debut. There are a lot of restrictions on when minors can and can\u2019t work (which is like the one good thing Korean Labor Laws have in place). Anyways, there are a few \u201cidol\u201d groups out there who are very young and essentially debut/branded as basically like a cutesy child-like group. An example would be Hi Cutie, the group debuted in 2017 with the oldest member is 14 and the youngest was 11. They don\u2019t promote very often and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen them on variety shows or music show stages.   Another particularly young group would be Busters, who also debuted in 2017 with the oldest member being 16 and the youngest being 12. They do portray to be a bit older than Hi Cutie but again, they don\u2019t promote very often and while they did do some music show performances, they don\u2019t really go on variety shows (though Chaeyeon is a regular host on a children\u2019s show).   Their company has come under fire for over sexualizing the girls before though. Which is also why it is not recommend to debut young. ",

            "answer_text": "The typical age range of a debuting idol group is somewhere between 16\u201321 or so (international age). In the last year there have been some slightly younger groups here and there like NCT\u2019s Dream subunit and YG\u2019s upcoming boy group with Bang Yedam, with members around 14\u201315 years of age. The South Korean government has discouraged this by placing heavy restrictions on idols under ~16 after a spate of really young groups around 12\u201313 in age several years ago raised complaints about child abuse. There\u2019s also the occasional older idol in their mid-20s that debuts as well (e.g. Solar in Mamamoo). Age at debut could reflect talent/star power but it could just be luck as well. Plenty of idols that debuted young just happened to join their agency months before a group debuted and filled a need, while others got unlucky and had to wait half a decade for the next group. ",

That is one of the reasons why entertainment companies in Korea hires children when they are still in middle school so that they are able to train for a longer period of time while debuting at a tender age of 15 or 20 years old.

If you are older than 18 they may not take you because you don\u2019t have much time and you are already an adult, usually you would train for about 4 years aswell, but you can still have a chance, Heechul from SUJU was not the ideal age but since he was good looking they let him in.

Therefore no, a nine year-old can\u2019t debut as a k-pop idol. You need to focus on your studies since you\u2019re just a 4th grader.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good age to debut anyway. You should start training at around that age then you can have more experience, you will be more likely to debut. ",

They don\u2019t judge you based on age, though. They judge you by how talented you are and how good your singing/rapping/dancing is. Hope I was Helpful~Bye~ ",
