            "answer_text": "While I stand to be corrected I think that car\u2019s with CD players are being phased out on the grounds of safety. Changing a compact disc while driving means you are required to take your attention off the main job in hand, namely safely driving the car, A memory stick can contain hundreds if not thousands of songs as can your smartphones and these devices can be plugged into the USB port or via Bluetooth. You can then program your music in advance or via the buttons on the steering wheel. I think it might even be possible to by just speaking instructions. Time moves on, The CD will soon be as obsolete as tape cassettes, VHS and Betamax. Best regards bob. ",
