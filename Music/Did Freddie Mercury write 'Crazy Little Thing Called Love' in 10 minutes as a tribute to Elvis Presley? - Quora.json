            "answer_text": "I have an article that is about this that is on Wikipedia. The article is called Crazy Little Thing Called Love - Wikipedia. It has a lot of things on it including this one quote: The song was written by Mercury as a tribute to Elvis Presley. Roger Taylor added in an interview that Mercury wrote it in just 10 minutes while lounging in a bath in the Bayerischer Hof Hotel in Munich during one of their extensive Munich recording sessions. You can read the rest of the article yourself and get the information directly from Wikipedia. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Just like you said. I read it (back when reading was an art, and there were these things called magazines) that he had a vocal riff and didn't know what to do with it. Then, in the bath, it hit him. He didn't want Brian May involved in it, because he wanted to keep it raw and rough with an unpolished quality. Brian likes a polished sound. ",
