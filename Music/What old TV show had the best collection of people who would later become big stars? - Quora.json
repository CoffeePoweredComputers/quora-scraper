            "answer_text": "I\u2019m always looking for people who later became big stars. Surprisingly, the one where I found future stars was Cannon? I know just your average private eye show from the 70\u2019s. But one show had a very young Martin Sheen. Pretty good. And in that episode a \u201cDan Travanti\u201d who later billed himself more augustly as Daniel J. Travanti when he starred in Hill Street Blues. There was an Alfred Hitchcock episode where a pharmacy makes a fatal mistake \u2014 it is Hitchcock, after all. The young delivery man was Robert Redford. But in watching a lot of Hitchcock shows I never saw two unknowns who became famous in a single episode. I don\u2019t know why more bit-part people don\u2019t end up becoming famous. ",
