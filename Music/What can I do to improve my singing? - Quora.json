            "answer_text": "Not sure who the singer you're referring to is, but I can give you a few general tips to improve your singing. ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS warm up properly.Do scales to improve range, and control over your voice. If you don't know what scales are, they're the lalalalala that goes higher then lower again in movies. You can find a lot of scales as warm-ups on the internet. If you have a piano, use it.Work on singing from your diaphragm. It's the muscle above your abs, beliw and around your lungs. If you breathe, and your shoulders are lifting, you're doing it wrong. There are plenty of tips to train your diaphragm on the internet as well, so use those.Find your range. Your range is the amount of notes ir octaves (a series of 8 cosecutive notes going higher or lower) you can sign comfortably without any vocal strain. Until you learn the proper techniques for doing so, do not go out of your range. These yechniques include falsetto, and belting. Also do not use these techniques too much since doing so can strain your voice.Practise practice practice. The voice is literally a muscle and training it constantly will make it \u2018fit\u2019. Fit muscles get injured less often and perform better don't they?",

Not \u201cpractice makes perfect,\u201d but rather \u201cperfect practice makes perfect.\u201d I say this, because you can practice all you like, but if you were doing it wrong, then you\u2019ve learned it wrong (this applies on more levels than just singing). Keep practicing, but have someone check your \u201cwork\u201d every now and then. They\u2019ll give you pointers that I can\u2019t do over the Web, as I can\u2019t hear you sing. You could also try mastering difficult songs. Songs that you know you wouldn\u2019t challenge otherwise. Master these, and simple songs will seem like a piece of cake. ",
