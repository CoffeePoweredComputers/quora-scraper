            "answer_text": "This question is very opinionated as there is not one k-pop group in the industry that has not made it without talent. Every group is worth stanning for. Just find something about the group that you might not find elsewhere or in any other group. A group that I stan pretty hard for is A.C.E. The members include Jun, Donghun, Byeongkwan, Wow, and Chan. Even though the group only debuted in May 2017. Each of the members has years of training and survival shows. The UnitJun - 21stChan - debuted with UNB.MixNineByeongkwan - 4thDonghun - 8thWow - 11thNote: MixNine debut group was canceled. Additionally, each member has multiple years of experience. Jun - Jellyfish Entertainment, CJ E&MDonghun - Superstar K5, CJ E&MByeongkwan - JYP Entertainment,Wow - YG Entertainment (could have debuted in Winner), CJ E&MChan - JYP Entertainment, Alive87 (dance crew)Even though they debuted a few months past a year, they have been busking together for a couple of years. I would recommend checking out their busking videos. They\u2019re so good. Videos: A.C.E(\uc5d0\uc774\uc2a4) - \uc120\uc778\uc7a5(CACTUS) MVA.C.E(\uc5d0\uc774\uc2a4) - Callin' MVA.C.E(\uc5d0\uc774\uc2a4) - TAKE ME HIGHER MVHcue - I Feel So Lucky (Official Video) ft. A.C.EIn addition to their MVs, I would check out their relay dances on Mnet. They\u2019re the kings at relay dances. ",

            "answer_text": "To this question there isn\u2019t a \u201cMost talented kpop group\u201d because all of them are equally good. I also think that all of the groups are worth to stan. All of them put all of their time and dedication to their songs. It also depends on your opinion. For me I think that BTS, Seventeen, EXO, Blackpink, SHINee, VIXX, and got7 are very talented. I don\u2019t know honestly but the question is a strange question because like I said. It depends on opinions. If I recommend BTS, you might not think they are the most talented or the most worth to stan. Anyway I hope this helps! ",
