            "answer_text": "The simple answer is that Paul has invested his money wisely, largely in publishing rights to songs. His MPL Publishing of course has the rights to his huge and lucrative post-Beatles output but he has bought many other catalogues as well with access to over 25,000 copyrights, including the publishing rights to the musicals Guys and Dolls, A Chorus Line, Annie and Grease. Since 2005, he is annually listed as not only the richest musician in the UK but also the highest grossing so the wealth keeps coming even in his mid-70s. Had he been successful in wresting control of Northern Songs and re-acquiring the rights to the Beatles catalogue, his wealth would be unfathomable. But he learned from those early mistakes and continues to buy up other copyrights (he owns over 25,000 songs) even though the copyrights of PS I Love You and Love Me Do are the only Beatles songs he owns outright.

Too Paul maarried a woman that at the time was wealthier than he was, so money managment would have been a built in concern in jis marriage. Not so with Mick's. Too, Mick blew a lot of money on champagne and blow. Dont worry about Mick though\u2026\u2026 Continued\u2026. Is he? Once you get past a certain amount\u2026it really doesnt matter. Both have been fairly astute. Maybe Paul hasnt made as many mis-steps. Both lost rights to their OWN songs at one point. Think where they could be standing. ",
