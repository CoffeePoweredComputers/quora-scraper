            "answer_text": "This could be a very long answer, as pretty much every Classical composer since Mozart was influenced by him to some degree, even those of later eras, whose music sounds radically different admired this Austrian master, such as Wagner, Mahler and Tschaikovsky. In short Mozart (1756\u201391) was a pianist and composer, who became one of the first to make a successful living as an independent artist, away from a court or particular patron. This gave him freedom to experiment with forms such as opera and the piano concerto, which he revolutionised and which are now ranked as exemplars. Mozart is, like Bach, Haydn and Beethoven someone who later \u201cclassical\u201d composers held up as an faultless in terms of melody, form, counterpoint, balance and texture. Simplicity, beauty and memorability are the things he achieved, which were, and are, his legacy. ",

            "answer_text": "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was the definitive composer of the Classical Era (roughly 1750 to roughly 1805 \u2014 as opposed to the generic term \u2018classical music\u2019, which is better described as western European art music from the renaissance to today). Perhaps no other composer\u2019s music has been studied as deeply and with such detail. He was born in Salzburg, in what is now Austria but spend most of his working life in Vienna (b. 1756 \u2014 d. 1791). He was a child prodigy who spent his childhood on tours of Europe, set up by his father. I won\u2019t go into any details, since whole shelves of books have been written about his music and life. Suffice to say, no discussion of Classical or classical music is even close to complete without discussion of him and his output. ",
