            "answer_text": "First of all you can not claim what anybody\u2019s sexuality is unless they say it themselves. Always make it a priority to make sure that the members are not uncomfortable because of things like assuming sexualities, ships, sexualising content and all of that. With that being said I highly doubt they will ever read this and I am just giving my opinions as a bisexual and an ARMY who has been around for years. However, do not trust in anything I say, this is just for fun and to exchange ideas. One thing for sure though is that all of them are allies because regardless of the homophobia that is highly prevalent in Korea, all the members have shown direct support for the LGBTQ+ community as well as shown support by openly supporting various people and media which is LGBTQ+ related. Okay now finally onto my thoughts. Seokjin - Heterosexual = I feel like Jin is straight, I really have no idea why but yeah. Like I\u2019m pretty sure he has at least entertained the thought of being with another man before, but I feel like he\u2019d think it\u2019s not for him. Yoongi - Pansexual = I could definitely see Yoongi like people regardless of their gender because that is how is attitude towards life is, \u201cwhy have boundaries, do what you want to\u201d. I could also see him as bisexual but the main difference between the two is mostly just the role a person\u2019s gender actually plays into attraction. I know there is that one Japanese interview where he said it doesn\u2019t matter if it is a boy or girl when he was asked about an ideal partner, but I have heard that the translation is not the most accurate so take it with a grain of salt. Of course there are also his lyrics about his \u201ctongue technology being able to turn on both guys and girls\u201d, but even that could just be to the no boundaries idea. His rap is just so awesome that everyone will be taken over it lol. Okay that\u2019s enough for Yoongi though. Hoseok - Heterosexual = Hobi also I feel like is straight. I could see him enjoying messing around with his gender expression in terms of fashion because anyways gender is just a societal construct and Hobi would be the type to ignore all of that and do what he wants to. For example, getting those super cute nail art designs. But in terms of sexuality I feel like he is into girls. Namjoon - Heterosexual = Namjoon is the first LGBT supportive king of BTS but for some reason I feel like he is a really really strong ally but who is still straight. Like Jin I could see him questioning his sexuality and considering being with men. He might also be pan or bi but even then I think he would be predominantly with women. Jimin - Bisexual = I know everyone is always like Jimin is GAYYY because I mean Jimin is literally stealing every man that sees him left and right lol but I think he is bisexual. Jimin clearly does not care much about following societies rules of gender expression and he just looks and acts the way he wants to. Over the last 2\u20133 years especially he has become much more comfortable but in terms of sexuality I still think he would be open to being with a person of any gender while still taking into account their gender. Pansexuality is also possible but I feel like he would care about the gender because I feel like he would have a different dynamic if he was with a man and women or a person of any other gender. Taehyung - Bisexual = Like his fellow 95-liner I feel like Taehyung would be into people of all genders while taking into account what that gender identity is. I think he would lean more towards women in general but I think he still is into people of other gender identities. As an add on I think Taehyung is the type of person to be demisexual as in a person who tends to find themselves sexually attracted only after forming an emotional connection and attraction to them first. He seems like the type to care predominantly for an emotional relationship. Jungkook - Heterosexual/Homosexual = Here is the thing about Jungkook, I think he is either super straight as in not even questioning being anything else orrrr he is super gay as in just gay no attraction to any other gender but the same as his whatsoever. I know I could just say bisexual for him but for some reason I feel like he is the type to only like one gender identity, either the same as his or the opposite as his. But I don\u2019t know which one lol. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe that all of them are straight. You can\u2019t believe what those translators mention on youtube. Everyone is quick to say Suga is bisexual when indeed the person who translated his comment did not do it correctly. The question that was given to him was what type of person do you like. He said he does not have a type and that he had to get to know them first. In which I completely understand. I do not have a type that I like in a man. What I may like in one person I may hate in the other. As for Jimin I have no idea where anyone thinks that he is gay. Jimin nope not in my book. I can say that a female looks pretty but it doesn\u2019t state that I like females. People need to understand what doesn\u2019t look right in America, it does in South Korea. Women and Men are all touchy feely in S.Korea. It doesn\u2019t mean anything. I have a friend who is from S. Korea born and raised. He is so much that way. He has pictures on his facebook page of hugging, holding hands with his best friend in S.Korea. There is nothing wrong with it. It doesn\u2019t mean he is gay or even bisexual. People here in America are so quick to judge someone else sexuality without even thinking. ",
