            "answer_text": "Because he drank a lethal dose of hemlock, which paralyzed and eventually killed him. If you mean why he was condemned to death, a number of factors were into play. 1. First of all, in Athens it was not uncommon to see an intellectual (philosopher, poet, sophist) get accused of impiety\u2014it was a common way of dealing with the politically or intellectually undesirables. 2. Socrates was accused of introducing new gods, since he contrasted his inner voice or daimonion with the oracle of Delphi, and also of corrupting the youth, because of the appeal he had on the younger generations and his teaching them to question the norms of society. 3. Socrates had also made a lot of prominent Athenians dislike him by engaging them in public dialogue and exposing their superficiality and empty pomposity. 4. Inside Socrates\u2019 cycle there were or had been a number of controversial public figures like Alcibiades. Some of them (e.g. Critias and Charmides) even played an active part in the regime of the Thirty Tyrants imposed on Athens by Sparta. When democracy was restored, Socrates became a victim of revanchism. After all, it\u2019s not very unusual to see a teacher receive backlash over their students\u2019 wrongs. 5. Socrates acted quite provocatively during his trial. For example, when asked what penalty he would propose for himself, he said he should be housed in the prutaneion and honored. That turned the jury against him. If you mean why Socrates chose to die rather than escape, as his students suggested, it\u2019s because he thought that would nullify his entire teaching and life up to that moment. Socrates believed that the law is to be respected, even when it\u2019s at fault, otherwise social and political order would crumble. He didn\u2019t want to betray his city by escaping like a coward and a hypocrite and, according to Plato, he once said: \u201cIf it were necessary either to do wrong or to suffer it, I\u2019d choose to suffer rather than do it.\u201d Besides, he was so deeply tied to Athens (he never left it except for taking part in a couple of military campaigns) he most probably didn\u2019t want to live anywhere else.

            "answer_text": "He lacked Quora to discuss the questions that bothered the youth of Athens. So he had to confront the parents of the youth he talked with in the body. They claimed he was corrupting them because they would argue with their parents and the parents wanted to be in complete control over their children. So they blamed Socrates. Socrates, after a trial that found him guilty, was given a choice of ostracism and leaving Athens or committing suicide. It is not clear to me what would have happened if Socrates just ignored either choice. But he was an old man and was probably aware that it would be death to leave Athens and even if left alone his life was becoming physically difficult for him . So he chose suicide, a relatively simple death to both shame the Athenians and to solve his problem of age. Did he have some agreement with Plato, one of the youth he corrupted to write down what he had done? That would have and did make Socrates immortal in a way that the youth could always be corrupted and the dictatorship of the parents could always be challenged with each new generation. And thus we have the Dialogs of Plato and Socrates\u2019 immortal words. ",
