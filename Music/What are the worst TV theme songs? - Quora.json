            "answer_text": "For myself it was the theme - or rather, themes - from a long-forgotten 70s series called James at 15, which was the story of a teenage boy whose family relocates from Eugene, Oregon to Boston, Massachusetts because his father is a college professor. Keep that in mind as you hear this completely non-sequitur piece of folk-hillbilly schlock which was the first incarnation of the series theme:  If the kid had come to Beantown from Kentucky or Tennessee this would make more sense, but simply moving from one established coastal college town to another, this choice in introductory music seems rather disjointed in a narrative sense. Someone on the production staff must have agreed with that assessment, because when the show was renewed for a second season, and renamed James at 16, the theme was rewritten into something more bubblegum pop-friendly, yet just as lyrically cluttered and musically jarring as the first theme:  The show was canceled before it could be renewed for a third season, presumably titled James at 17, and most likely because the audio recording equipment in the studio committed machine suicide before allowing itself to be subject to a third effort at making a worse intro. The two greatest TV themes of all time - Gilligan\u2019s Island and The Brady Bunch - were crafted in order to succinctly explain to the viewer exactly what the show was about so they could just jump in and be entertained with a full understanding of the premise. In comparison to this formula, James at 15/16 is a mess of evocative imagery about walking sticks and flowing rivers which tells me I\u2019m supposed to feel something when I hear it, but never really making it clear why this is the case.

It will run through your head for the rest of your life. You have been warned! It\u2019s the 1966 cartoon of Hulk, based directly on Marvel Comics.
