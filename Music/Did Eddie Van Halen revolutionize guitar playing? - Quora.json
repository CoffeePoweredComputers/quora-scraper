            "answer_text": "He actually did. There was no way to transcribe a lot of what he was doing with his right hand technique in the tapping realm. It was too unconventional for sheet music. He is primarily the reason tablature took off in the way it did. A guitarist who couldn't read music, created a style so complex, it defied transcription into musical notes. It's fitting. I remember struggling with his work. Going to shows and watching him closely as a kid, and figuring it out over time. But it took years to become somewhat competent. He was also a master of tones and feedback. The reason why is because in the beginning, they could not afford all the pedals and effects other bands were using. Eddie had to find another way to manipulate the guitar, and express himself musically. I think he achieved that. He's one of the first rock guitarists to excite me. He actually wanted to play drums. His brother was taking flamenco guitar lessons. His brother became a better drummer than he did, and I think Eddie did alright! Amazing! ",
