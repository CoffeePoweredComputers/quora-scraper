            "answer_text": "Yes, you can! It is just like singing a whole song. The difference is that you are singing into the kazoo and your syllable usage might be limited. However since the tune of the song is the priority and you don't have to actually emphasize on the lyrics, playing a song on a Kazoo is actually easier. But there are few dynamics that you have to get used to. Hope this helps. Cheers! ",
