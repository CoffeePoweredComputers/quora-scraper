            "answer_text": "With Berklee, it\u2019s not so much about \u201cgetting in\u201d - but rather what you \u201cget out\u201d of your experience there. If you\u2019ve got the money and descent chops you can get in. If you\u2019re looking for scholarship it\u2019s going to be quite a bit tougher. Berklee College of Music and the Boston Conservatory are now interlinked. That\u2019s important to know. When I was there the conservatory musicians were \u201cthe competition.\u201d They make a great ally as well - and this opens up additional opportunities for students. Berklee is not really a school for the person who wants to be a choir teacher or band director. North Texas or University of Northern Iowa or many other schools will get you there. Berklee is for the person who wants to be a great musician. Who has music in their heart that\u2019s trying to break out. Berklee is where you make an impression. It\u2019s where you network. It\u2019s where you hone your craft. It\u2019s a magnificent spring board. Know that you may only be at Berklee for a year\u2026maybe two. Find the open door and get yourself in. Those visiting producers, musicians, studio heads\u2026get to know them. Every opportunity that\u2019s posted\u2026grab onto it. Every chance to showcase your music\u2026take it. It\u2019s not about \u201cgetting in\u201d it\u2019s about what you \u201cget out\u201d of Berklee. Berklee has been the highlight of my resume for 30 years now. The education bullet that everyone asks about. And I was only there for 1 year. And yet that one year has benefited me as a musician for a lifetime. ",

            "answer_text": "That is a common question with a complicated answer. Having gotten in myself (and actually graduated, no small feat there) I can say that my application, audition, and interview were all extremely important opportunities to be completely honest with who I am as a musician and person within society. That sounds strange but bear with me, Berklee sees the best musicians from around the world auditioning for them. After my time there I am sure I am not in the top ranks of those musicians but got in regardless. The way I approached the entire process was to focus on what makes me both a strong musician and a person that would be a good addition to their college. Depending on your instrument the audition part can be slightly different. What they look for is a general knowledge of harmony and melody as well as the ability to think and react musically and that you have a niche that you are good at. The interview is a relaxed conversation between you and usually either a volunteer alumni or someone else associated with the college. If you're truly passionate about music and come off that way in the interview (assuming you already have in the ridiculously long application) your chances are very good to get in. If this was too confusing or simply not helpful let me know, the more specific you can be and want to be the better I can help. Either way, I can say my particular route was very easy in terms of getting in because I was doing something I loved and I showed that by performing things I was great at, not necessarily what was flashy or technically superior.
