            "answer_text": "As several have said, it has to do with the language and sounds. The way you speak and the way the listener hears it. \u201cWant you\u201d spoken quickly blends together. You hear a \u201ctyu\u201d sound which comes across as \u201cchu\u201d. This is much more common in popular music where the vocalist is not classically trained. Seldom will you hear it in classical music because vocalists in that genra tend to enunciate their words more carefully. Also, even if Robin Zander is clearly saying \u201c I. Want. You. To. Want. Me. \u201c into the microphone, the effects, distortion, distance, surrounding crowd noise, etc., will most likely cause you to hear, \u201cah wan chu to wan mee\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cI wan chu to want me\u2026\u201d It\u2019s a slurring effect resulting from the difficulty in going from the \u2018T\u2019 sound with the tongue pressed against the upper front gum to the pursed-lip, tongue back \u2018U\u2019 sound. Try it - say the clipped \u2018want you\u2019 then say the more slurred and easier to pronounce \u2018wan chu\u2019 paying attention to all the moves your mouth an tongue have to go through for each variant. \u2018Want you\u2019 is 4 phonemes wah-n-t-u and \u2018wan chu\u2019 is only 3 (wah-n-chu) and much easier to sing. The next phrase in that song \u201cI need you to to need me\u201d, \u2018need you\u2019 is pronounced in only 2 phonemes: \u2018nee\u2019 and \u2018dyu\u2019, so you have two forms of you, chu and dyu, in that one line alone. If sung with \u2018proper\u2019 pronunciations, the lyric sounds formal and stilted. ",
