            "answer_text": "Records:  That was the beginning of music exploration for me, and still is a great part.  I browse Thrift Stores, and the local Record store for new titles, and talk to others that are browsing as well.  I have over 2000 records, and I have only listened to about 2/3 of the collection.    Sound Cloud: I follow producers on Soundcloud and I click on artists that I enjoy to see who they follow. Taste Kid: I type in artist that I enjoy and it shows me other artitst I might enjoy. Parties: The new mix tape.  I love listening to and discussing music at parties.  I discovered Devin Townsend, Mindless Self Indulgence, Flogging Molly, COB, Marilyn Manson, Eminem, all early in their carriers, all at parties.  Music Sharing: Yes its Illegal, also very time consuming to go through all of the stuff one might download, but back before lawsuits told us it was illegal you could broaden your horizons beyond local radio.  Sure you downloaded the entire Discography of Gwar which turned out to be not so great, but all the bootleg The Doors recordings were very very good, as well as discovering that Hip Hop was great back in the 80s/90s when you downloaded the best 400 songs in Hip Hop.  Which led you into a further discovery that Run DMC was fantastic and you purchased their Record. Now as an alternative to Downloading, I listen to Soundcloud, and I research the artists on their websites, of course this was not possible in '99, because the internet was super slow.    Not Pop Radio!:  Holy marketing BS Batman!  The reason that most songs hit the top 40 is paid placement on the radio and You Tube.  As the top 40 proves, our general public is not exposed to enough music to be the judicial committee on what should be popular.  Its simply popular, because they said it was popular. ",

            "answer_text": "I built a really simple web-app to deal with this exact issue. I always felt like the song-suggestion algorithms that Spotify and SoundCloud are pretty useless, so I built my site with an adaptive selection algorithm. You can check it out here: MusicFinder - discover new music I should preface that the site is very new and hasn\u2019t had many users yet, so some song suggestions may not be very good. However, as people use it the database of songs/artists as well as the accuracy of predictions will improve quickly. ",
