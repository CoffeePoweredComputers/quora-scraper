            "answer_text": "No idea. You don\u2019t have to like modern music. It\u2019s not mandatory. It\u2019s not mandatory to only like classic rock, or 40\u2019s country, or early disco, or jump blues. It\u2019s not mandatory to like music from any decade, any period, any generation. There\u2019s no such thing as music that\u2019s too ancient for youth to listen to, or being too old to listen to new music. There\u2019s just music. Whether it be made by banging rocks together or clicking around a computer, it all takes ability, talent, knowledge and practice. The one thing about all music is you don\u2019t have to like it and you should never be apologetic for liking what you like. And there\u2019s so much music out there, so much variety from every age and all over the world that you\u2019re going to find something to like. And probably, something you don\u2019t like. If it so happens that it\u2019s \u2018modern music\u2019, which is a term that relates only to calendars, then that\u2019s that and it\u2019s a little bit of a shame, but it ain\u2019t no big deal.

If you really want to appreciate it, listen to a lot of it. That being said there is no requirement that you like modern music. You could live a long satisfying life by ignoring it ",
