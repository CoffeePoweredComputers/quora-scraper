            "answer_text": "Because they are war refugees from Northern China, not Guangdong natives. Matter of fact, Hakka in Chinese is \u5ba2\u5bb6\uff0c literally means \u201cguest families\u201d. So you know they are not local natives. But this \u201cguest\u201d can be traced back centuries ago:  This picture demonstrates how Hakka people fled for war from Northern China to South at 4th Century (\u4e94\u80e1\u4e71\u534e\uff09then moved even more south at 10th century (\u5b89\u53f2\u4e4b\u4e71\uff09followed another movement at 12th century (\u8499\u53e4\u5165\u4fb5). Hakka language presents lots elements of Old Chinese.  Here is Sino-Tibetan languages relationship. You can see Old Chinese developed into Old Wu-Min language family (extinct), includes Min, Wu, Gan-Hakka. Then later on Southern Gan developed into Hakka. Different as Min, Wu and other Gan languages, which were developed locally. Hakka was a language preserved in the immigration progress due to its close family structure. One key difference, despite Hakka and Cantonese are both widely spoken in Guangdong, but they are rooted very differently, Hakka is based on Old Chinese (\u4e0a\u53e4\u6c49\u8bed\uff09and Cantonese is based on Middle Chinese (\u4e2d\u53e4\u6c49\u8bed), same as Mandarin. They\u2019re two separate development track in linguistic view. Hakka people lived at those fortress like building as family unit for thousands of years.  Therefore, their languages and cultures were preserved from outside influence. However, those buildings weren\u2019t able to stand for modern rifles and cannons. Therefore when Qing Dynasty conquered China and moved toward South , many Hakka fled again toward west, those relocated to Sichuan and Guangxi, later on become the main force of Taiping rebellion. Again, during the Taiping rebellion, many Hakka people fled oversea to Taiwan and Southeast Asia. Still majority of Hakka people still lived in Guangdong. There\u2019re no other places can be fled to with large population group\u2026 That\u2019s why most Hakka still live in Guangdong today. Hakka population density map  ",
