            "answer_text": "This is just me stating facts, I don\u2019t have intentions of writing this as hate towards the idols, which are going to get picked by me. All of them are known for being the most popular in the group, so I don\u2019t think that my answers will shock you. Also, I don\u2019t stan every single group out there, so I will not list every group here. BTS Jungkook I almost put Jimin here, because from what I am seeing every month, he is the number 1 favorite idol every month for how long I can remember, but even though the ranking is based on people\u2019s opinion, I still think that Jungkook is the most popular - he is not receiving the most spotlight as I believe that this doesn\u2019t really exist in the case of BTS, but he the member, who pops up in many people\u2019s heads when someone says \u201cBTS\u201d. Many people adore him because he is the \u201cgolden maknae\u201d and for some reason, he is the most relatable member, due to him being the youngest, for most of the fandom out there. I am not really able to tell you more reasons, because he is not my bias and I don\u2019t really see that much things on him, which would want me to make the bias out of him (but that is my opinion, he seems like a lovely boy)  GOT7 Jackson This has been tricky, mostly because there are also other members like BamBam or Jinyoung, which are the most popular, but I think that Jackson is still able to beat them. He is promoting in China, in the US, he has been in many shows as an individual and also as the only member so far promote as a soloist having many popular songs in his discography - Papillon, 100 ways, etc. Also considering, how many fanfics on Wattpad Jackson are appearing without people actually know who he is, is just proving my point. Whenever this boy is put in the spotlight, he just makes the whole crowd fell in love with him (like, remember his reaction to JYP\u2019s performance with Hwasa = LEGENDARY) and I tend to believe that he is also the member, which brings most of the people to the fandom.  EXO Baekhyun Again, there are many members, who are really loved by the public the most - Chanyeol, Kai, or Sehun -, but Baekhyun is just treasurer by the fandom the most, not just for his dorky personality and cute appearance, but also for his amazing vocal skills. He is just the member, who always makes people laugh in any type of situation and that is probably another reason, why he is so popular. He has this youthful appearance, which is making many people fall in love with him, but if you are keeping up with the group, this popularity is sometimes the thing, which is making him feel bad - when Chen announced his marriage and baby, people were telling that SM Entertainment doesn\u2019t care, just because Chen is not Baekhyun and doesn\u2019t have such popularity as the other main vocal of the group.  NCT Taeyong/Lucas NCT is huge, you probably know that. Therefore, I wasn\u2019t really able to pick just one member. Taeyong was a sure thing, but then I thought about it and I realized how big influence even Lucas have in the group when he got more opportunities/lines as a whole new member than some members, who have been in a group for way longer time did.  (Lee Taeyong) Both of them are getting the most spotlight in their music, which means that people notice them more than other members. Both of them are known for being handsome and extra talented.  (Wong Yukhei - Lucas) If I should be honest with you, I was also thinking about putting Mark there, so honorable mention to that Canadian boy, because he is pretty popular too and I think that even though you don\u2019t know NCT, you still heard or saw one of these boys.  (Mark Lee) STRAY KIDS Hyunjin/Felix Both of them are extremely popular, mostly for their visuals. I don\u2019t really know why so many fans are so attracted to Felix because when I was a new STAY (name of their fandom), the only thing which I remembered about him was the deep voice, which didn\u2019t suit his adorable face and him being another Aussie (again, this is not me bashing Felix, but now understanding what makes him so popular - I had to put him here as he is considered the most popular member).  When it comes to Hyunjin, I get the hype he gets, because he is extremely handsome (just like Felix and the rest of the group), but his visuals suit the beauty standards the most. And every time when there is a visual out there who is also talented like Hyunjin in dancing and rapping, people can go crazy. Also, he posts the most selfies on their social media, and even though most of them are taken from the same angle, he is always stunning in them and their fans can go crazy whenever Hyunjin posts something.  ATEEZ San Again, he is a handsome one (why does it feel like the most popular ones are always the visuals?), but I think that he is more known for his stage present and powerful dancing. He gets most of the spotlight whenever the beat drops in their songs as he is just master in facial expressions. You can take a look:   ASTRO Eunwoo I think that he is the most famous example of it. Not just thanks to his amazing visuals, but also his acting skills, he is for sure the most popular member, who even though he doesn\u2019t have any main or lead position in the group, still manages to get most spotlight in almost everything ASTRO do. The group probably wouldn\u2019t be famous if they didn\u2019t have him and I am saying that as their fan. Eunwoo really brought in most of the fans.  SHINee Taemin/Minho I think that Taemin is here, because now when most of the fans came into the k-pop family, they got used to seeing the group only represented by Taemin, because other members serve the military, while the youngest Taemin will go, once the other members will come back. Also, who wouldn\u2019t know Taemin\u2019s dancing skills and amazing solo work, right?  Minho is attracting people with his looks and athleticism. If some idol is handsome and looks a bit like Minho, they always compliment him - \u201cYou look like Minho from SHINee = handsome\u201d. I think that most of his popularity comes from his acting as he acted several times.  BigBang GD It is obvious that G-Dragon is not considered as a king just for the fans, but also for the YG as a company. Because he started really early in the industry, he managed to build so strong fanbase and be so loved by the general public, that even the scandals which he went through didn\u2019t affect his title of the \u201cmost popular member of BigBang and one of the most known soloist\u201d  TWICE Tzuyu/Nayeon I couldn\u2019t decide between these two amazing girls. Again, Tzuyu is popular because of her beauty and because he is the youngest member of the group, while Nayeon is just a likable person overall with well-known vocals. Nayeon is usually the one that catches most of the attention of the new fans because she gets most of the iconic lines in their songs.  (Tzuyu)  (Nayeon) Red Velvet Irene Again my theory is being confirmed - the visuals are the most popular ones. Irene is a gorgeous woman, who is also talented and even though she hit thirty years old, she is just out there looking like a fresh twenty-year-old. I think that she is so known because her name is said in the industry so many times, that some fans may know how she looks like, but don\u2019t even know from what group is she - just like Jackson.  BLACKPINK Lisa I was thinking about Jennie, but I think that Lisa is just more popular overall. She is like a magnet for all international fans because she is gorgeous, dances well, and raps like a badass girl at the same time, which is like a goal for many people in the west. I also feel like, because she is from Thailand and is the only non-Korean member, it causes more attention to her too. Even though she has miserable clothes and she is not as promoted as Jennie, she still manages to be more popular.  ITZY Yeji I think this is obvious. Maybe it is because of her unique, but still breath-taking visuals or maybe because she is such a talented young girl, which already build some fanbase while featuring on Stray Kids' survival show, where she got the most praise I believe from the JYP himself for her skills.  EVERGLOW Mia/Yiren I think that Mia is mostly known to her having the most lines and spotlight in the group with also having amazing skills, proving that she is able to cope with all of that, while Yiren is known for being the youngest and visual (just like Tzuyu).  (Mia)  (Yiren) MAMAMOO Hwasa I think that she is mostly known for not giving a f*ck about what people think of her. She id different from every single idol out there, because she is not scared to do anything, even though the netizens will bash her for that. She has unique visuals, great fashion style, and is breaking many stereotypes in the industry. Simply said - a queen.  G-Idle Soyeon Another example of a member who is bashed for being favorited by the company and having the most spotlight, even though it is not true. I think that Soyeon is another example of being more known as an individual than a part of the group. Many people out there saw her or at least heard her name, without knowing who she actually is.  OH MY GIRL YooA I believe that she is the most popular member, thanks to her beauty and dancing skills. She is so much underrated dancer that it is making me angry. Mostly it is because the group got really famous just recently when they released their song Nonstop, but YooA is someone, who catches the attention of many new fans. Also, many people know her thanks to her brother who is a choreographer at probably the most famous dance studio in Korea - 1Million Dance Studio.  MOMOLAND JooE She is mostly famous for her looks - some people find her beautiful and some ugly. She also publicly spoke up about getting plastic surgery, which just made her look more unique than she already was. Most of her popularity sadly comes from being part of the probably most hated girl group out there and because she is in the spotlight of most of their content, many people send her so much hate that in the end, she is becoming famous for that.  2NE1 CL She is known for being favorited by YG just like Jennie is now back then when 2NE1 were still active. CL was also known for collaboration with GD and many other artists within the company. She was the face of the group back then and so far is the only member who got the chance to debut in the US. With GD by her side, they were the faces of YG.  ",

            "answer_text": "These are just observations from the groups that I know of. I\u2019ll interpret this as the member who is most popular/most known by fans. Super JuniorHeechul - he is well known in the entertainment industry. He has been on many variety programmes like Knowing Bros, My Little Old Boy, Love of 7.7 Billion (a more recent show) and Life Bar.  Leeteuk - he is a well known mc in Korea. He has been on programmes like I Can See Your Voice, Strong Heart and Star King. He is also the leader of SuJu. Most people have heard his name before, even if they haven\u2019t seen his face.  2. SHINee Taemin - he is a well known dancer in KPOP. Many idols look up to him as their role model. He debuted at an extremely young age and is the only one actively promoting at the moment as the rest of the members are in military.  3. EXO Baekhyun - he is one of the members with the most fans. he has done some solo work so he has quite a number of solo fans. He is popular for his vocals and his high notes. He is also in Super M, another popular group from sm.  Kai - he is well known for his skills in dance, like Taemin. He is known for having a very sexy vibe when he dances. Kai is also in super M. he was also known for dating Krystal (f(x)) and Jennie (Blackpink). (you go, king!)  4. NCT127 Taeyong - he is known as sm\u2019s favourite in NCT. he is given a lot of parts in most of their music and is always put in front during performances. he is also known for his extremely good looks, with many people complimenting him for it. he is nct\u2019s leader.  Mark Lee - most people know him as one of sm\u2019s best rappers. he has debuted 4 times and is definitely one of sm\u2019s favourites. he is also korean-canadian and can speak good English, which makes him relatively popular amongst English speaking fans.  5. NCT dream Haechan - this one was a bit hard to decide but I would say it\u2019s Haechan. this is because he is also in nct127, and has more exposure than the rest of the dreamies. he is well known for being a good vocalist, and also for being unafraid to share his opinions. (when he spoke on sasaengs outside nct\u2019s dorm on his birthday)  6. WayV Lucas - he is known for his extremely good looks and manly face. his story of getting into sm just by posing a few times is popular. he is also on Keep Running, China which gives him quite a large fanbase there.  7. GOT7 Jackson Wang - he is well known in China and all around the world as he has quite a number of solo works. he even has his own label and produces his own music. he has also appeared in a lot more variety shows than the rest of the members.  Bambam - he is really popular in Thailand (where he\u2019s from). he is probably the most popular Thai idol, aside from Lisa. he is known as the prince of Thailand and is extremely respected there. he is the ambassador for many brands in Thailand and owns a chain of korean restaurants there.  8. BTS Jungkook - he is most known as the golden maknae by fans. anything he does gets a lot of attention from fans, regardless of if it\u2019s good or bad (unfortunately). amongst fans, he is probably the most well known member because of his good looks and clear voice.  9. The Rose (they aren\u2019t idols but they are a band. I need to plug my babies they are so talented and deserve more recognition) Woosung - he does quite a number of solo works and is known for his amazing voice. fans say he sings in cursive (seriously, check then out and you\u2019ll know). he is also the main vocalist and can speak good English, which makes him the most popular amongst the other members.  10. Red Velvet Irene - she is known for her ice queen looks. she is extremely beautiful and fits in all the korean beauty standards. she is the leader of the group.  Joy - she is known in the acting industry and has acted in a few well known dramas such as Tempted and The Liar & His Lover. she is also known for her bright smile (like her name).   11. Blackpink Jennie - she is one of yg\u2019s favourites and she is promoted the most by the company. people also know her for her rbf and ice queen looks. she also receives a lot of hate from people (unfortunately) due to yg\u2019s clear favouritism over her (it\u2019s not her fault!). she also dated Kai from exo.  Lisa - she is known for being a good dancer and is one of the fan\u2019s favourites. she is extremely popular in Thailand (her home country) and has a large fanbase there. Recently she was a mentor in a popular Chinese programme, Youth with You and gained popularity in China as well.  that\u2019s it! please note that these idols are the most popular in the group, but it doesn\u2019t mean the rest aren\u2019t popular or talented. ~ em ",
