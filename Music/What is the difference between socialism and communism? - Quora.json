            "answer_text": "The problem with unpacking this is that both words have multiple interpretations. The word \u201ccommunism\u201d has had two meanings. Prior to the Russian revolution of 1917, the word was often used interchangeably with \u201csocialism\u201d \u2014 so there wasn\u2019t really any clear distinction. Back then communism was understood as a society that no longer has a class division \u2014 it is a classless society run by the \u201cassociated producers\u201d. And it would not have a bureaucratic top-down state machine either because the state was viewed as an institution to protect a dominating, exploiting class. After the Russian revolution, the Russian Bolsheviks \u2014 a particular socialist party \u2014 changed the name of their party to \u201cCommunist\u201d and built the Communist International to group socialist parties aligned with them. The Communist movement built from that point on was infused with the ideology of the Bolsheviks \u2014 a Leninist form of Marxism. They were committed to the idea of a \u201cvanguard party\u201d \u2014 a party of militants \u2014 overthrowing the old states and creating a new state with a one-party monopoly of power, to implement their conception of socialism, based on a managerialist conception of state socialism. In practice this ended up creating a new bureaucratic ruling class. This was the opposite of what \u201ccommunism\u201d meant in the 19th century \u2014 and was not what Marx had in mind. Socialism, on the other hand, is an umbrella term that refers to the various strands of socialism. We can group these roughly into three groups. First, there is the Communist movement that includes the various strands of Leninist Marxism that derive from the legacy of the Bolsheviks. Second, there are the electoral party oriented socialists. They differentiated themselves from the Communists after World War 1 because of their support for the western European and North American systems of \u201crepresentative democracy\u201d and their strategy was to pursue change with an eye to a gradual change to socialism through a series of reforms. In more recent decades in the USA these electorally oriented socialists in USA call themselves \u201cdemocratic socialists\u201d and often support market socialism as their vision of what they have in mind \u2014 a society of worker managed cooperative enterprises, maybe with some state run industries. The tendency for the electoral socialists over time has been to move away from advocacy of socialism as replacement system towards merely seeking reforms to capitalism \u2014 benefit systems like health care, restrictions on the predatory behavior of capitalist firms. But this is called \u201csocial democracy\u201d and is not actually a form of socialism even tho it evolved out of it. The third tendency are the libertarian socialists \u2014 syndicalists, anarchists and so on \u2014 who conceive of socialism in terms of a basis in participatory democracy \u2014 with the state and corporations replaced by the neighborhood and workplace assemblies and coordinating congresses and councils. So on this model workers would manage all the industries and the state would be broken down into a more democratic form of governance. Thus, to come back to the question. If people call themselves \u201ccommunists\u201d you have to ask them questions to determine whether they have in mind the more grassroots early concept of communism (as anarcho-communists do) or are they advocates for the Leninist vanguard party taking state power? If the latter, then we know that they will have differences with both the libertarian socialists and the \u201cdemocratic socialists\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Communism is typically classified as a subset of socialism representing an advanced stage of socialist development where the articles of consumption and basic necessities are freely distributed, the means of producing wealth are held in common, and individuals are free to pursue their own interests (i.e. all forms of mandatory labor are abolished because society no longer has need for work as traditionally understood). Communism as an economic system is presumed to become feasible only with appropriate advances in technology, but precursors to communism exist today, the most notable example being open source and free software development. Socialism is simply defined as a range of economic systems where the means of producing wealth are under social ownership - i.e. the net social product is remitted to the entire society as opposed to becoming the capital income of a separate class of private owners. In the classical socialist formulation, social ownership also included the integration of (most) economic institutions and activity into a single integrated network that dispensed with the need for market transactions for the factors of production (since allocations would now be internal transfers within this single network). In the market socialist formulation, enterprises would exist as separate firms and operate to maximize profits while factor markets would exist to allocate factor inputs between the socially-owned firms, the major difference between market socialism and capitalism being the ownership of firms and thus the distribution of profits. Market socialism is very different from communism despite being based on social ownership and appropriation of the social product. Even classical planned / non-market socialism is significantly different from communism because it would still require a social mechanism to induce people to work (much like capitalism), even if the necessary work requirement is progressively declining under socialism. Furthermore all forms of socialism presuppose the continued existence of property (in the form of various public, cooperative and collective property) whereas communism is the negation of property as it implies holding assets in common (i.e. no one group \u201cowns\u201d any means of production nor can there be any income rights because income in the form of monetary return wouldn\u2019t exist). Another fundamental difference between socialism and communism is the role of economic calculation. Just like a capitalist system, socialism requires a method for comparing and calculating costs of producing different goods and services; this is less an issue in a communist system where superabundance is the basis for its existence. Hence communism is often distinguished from socialism on the basis of its principle of distribution: under socialism the basis for distribution is individual contribution (to the social product), whereas under communism it is subjective need (implying free access). I agree with the position of communism representing an advanced development of socialism, but would caution that a communist society would be far different from a socialist one - perhaps even more so than the differences between capitalism and socialism. In colloquial usage, the term \u201cCommunism\u201d as a slur encompassing everything from the form of government of the former USSR and eastern bloc countries, authoritarianism, Marxism-Leninism / Bolshevism and socialist economics. The economic system of the former Soviet Union was a command economy and represented an attempt to construct a socialist economy; it was never a communist system and arguably never even achieved socialism. Edit: Collapsed Answer to a similar question: The fundamental difference between the two is their relationship to the concept of property. Socialism is based on a system of property rights vested in the community as a whole whereas communism abolishes the concept of property altogether by making productive assets a part of the commons. From a Marxist perspective - which is the only logical way to understand communism - communism can only exist once technological developments permit material superabundance that renders the concept of property and capital superfluous. By extension, communism has no need for money and arguably no need for a state to enforce property rights and restrictions. Communism is sometimes described as a \u201chigher stage\u201d or \u201cextreme\u201d form of socialism because it requires socialism to lay the foundations for a communist system, but the difference between socialism and communism at the conceptual level are more substantial. To illustrate the distinction between the \u201csocial ownership\u201d of socialism and the \u201ccommon ownership\u201d of communism, a publicly-owned enterprise that generates economic value that is remitted to the public at large would be one example of a socialist institution in which specific property rights (the capital goods used in the production of the firm\u2019s output) are vested. By contrast, the open-source code of an open source software project would be an example of communistic \u201ccommon ownership\u201d where the entire concept of property is negated and no one individual or organization owns the project\u2019s source code. When talking about the politicized definition of big-c \u201cCommunism\u201d meaning adherence to Marxism-Leninism (the ideology of historical and extant \u201cCommunist states\u201d), then the difference is that \u201cCommunism\u201d is a specific subset of socialism based on Lenin\u2019s theory of imperialism, support for the creation of a Vanguard party, a single-party state, the practice of democratic centralism, and often support for a Soviet-type planned economy. On the other hand, a \u201csocialist\u201d is anyone who advocates for some kind of socialist economy.
