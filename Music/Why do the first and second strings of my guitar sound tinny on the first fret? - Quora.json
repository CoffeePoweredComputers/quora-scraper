            "answer_text": "Hi. If it's just one fret that gives you this problem, then I doubt very much you have an issue with the neck relief (curvature of the neck), or the action (string height). Since it's these two (E and B) strings which causes you a problem, my gut feeling would be to take a look at the second fret. Some times neck wood dries our a bit and the end of the fret may lift from the fretboard. If it's a guitar you've been playing a long time, it may also be that you have a grooved fret (in your case this would be the first). However, it is very seldom that a slightly grooved fret will cause a problem like this. If it was just one string, it could have been problems with the string itself. On rare occasions, you may have a bad string that needs changing. If the strings are old (and you don't see any issues with the frets), you should definitely change the strings. Another option - in case it's an electric guitar - is that you have a pickup (usually) the neck pickup a little too close to the strings. This may some times give a magnetic \"pull\" that is too strong, in effect dampening the string. This some times occur together with a low action. But again, it is rare to hear it on just one fret... Just for safe measures, you should have the guitar checked by a qualified tech. A loose fret is easy to fix for someone with experience. He/she will also check the other things mentioned here at the same time. it may be that you could benefit from having the relief adjusted slightly. This is done with the neck truss rod and it is not something you want to mess with yourself. Oh and for the future - remember to specify what sort of guitar you have, what type and gauge of strings you use, pickups etc :-)----45+ years of setting up, repairing, playing and dealing with guitars and other stringed instruments.

            "answer_text": "It may be that it is \"fretting out\" slightly on the 2nd or 3rd (or even higher) fret. Try this:  put a capo on it, just behind the first fret. Then slide a piece of paper or a thin wire (like an E string) or something under the string towards the 2nd fret. If it clears between the  underneath of the string and top of the fret, keep going to the 3rd fret etc.  If it stops at one of the frets or is close enough that the string vibrates against the fret  while being played you may need to either adjust the neck, the bridge, or the nut slot may be cut too low.  I know these can be confusing, but you should be able to figure out what the issue is.  You didn't mention if it's an acoustic or electric...on most electrics you can adjust the bridge height independently for each string etc.. You can also check the curvature of the neck (if any) by putting a metal straight-edge along the length of the neck, checking for \"rocking\" which indicates a backward bending neck, or for gaps between the straight edge and the tops of the frets. Some players like a little \"relief\" in their neck profile and some prefer it to be pretty much flat (I like it flat) when strung up and under tension.  You didn't mention if it has always done this, or if it started recently  or with a new set of strings etc.  With colder weather many (particularly acoustic) guitars will draw up a bit due to generally less moisture in the air OR sometimes a string will be bad and have a dead spot in it and the solution could be to replace the string.  There are a lot of things it could be, just trying to give you some things to take a look at.  The good news is that whatever it turns out to be you can probably fix it fairly easily or a good guitar tech can!  Good luck! ",
