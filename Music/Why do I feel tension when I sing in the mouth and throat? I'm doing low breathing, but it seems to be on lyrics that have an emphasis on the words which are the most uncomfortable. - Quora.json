            "answer_text": "Less is more. You are not successfully directing your airflow into your head and nasal cavities, so that you have completely efficient resonance for the amount of airflow you have running through your throat to your head. The air resonation is probably becoming even more obstructed when you have consonants that require a more harsh dictation than others. Practice being as relaxed as possible in your throat mouth and head when you sing. This will help you learn to not over exert your airflow as a way to cover up tension in your mouth nose head and throat. The goal in singing is to be as relaxed as possible, and to use as little muscle and exertion as possible. This will allow you to project farther, and have an overall more beautiful, resonating sound. Good luck! One last step, make sure to not over pronunciation your consonants. Consonants are the same as airflow, in the sense that less is more and you want to be using as little effort and muscle as possible. Try thinking of The way your mouth obstructs airflow every time you have to slightly close it to pronounce consonants. The shorter time it takes to pronounce a consonant, the quicker your airflow can begin to resonate again. This is why some professional opera singers seem to barely pronounce consonants before their mouth is fully open again and resonating at full volume. Singing is mostly done with an open mouth and clear resonance. Consonants are just mostly for dramatic affect, and communicating the lyrics. ",
