            "answer_text": "Come on guys, that\u2019s not a good comparison. Tommy Emmanuel is wonderful, but his acoustic guitar style is quite different from the Brazilian acoustic guitar one (Actually, Brazilian acoustic guitar is not called \u201cguitar\u201d, whereas electric guitar is, reflecting the huge difference between the instruments) . Tommy generally plays a bluesy/folk/jazzy fingerstyle in steel strings guitar, while Yamandu and Raphael play bossa/samba style in nylon 7-strings guitars . The technique, harmony, and rhythm are all different. I believe both of them could be compared to other Brazilian guitar players, as well as classical and flamenco ones (andres segovia, paco de lucia,\u2026) . Particularly, I think Raphael is pretty \u201cmore powerful\u201d than Yamandu. He died young and theres a lack of good quality videos on youtube, but check this:  ",
