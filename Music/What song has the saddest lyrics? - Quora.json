            "answer_text": "I love a good miserable song. Years ago while looking for a list of sad songs, I came across a list (2007, I think, ( based on this link - 25 Most Exquisitely Sad Songs in the Whole World - I tried to find the link to the original list as it went into a bit of detail about each song). There were a few songs I knew, Nothng Compares to you by Sinead OConnor, Hallelujah by Jeff Buckley and so on, but there were loads I didn't, do I set out to download all of them from the Internet. This was before Spotify took off and I didn't have a smart phone, so I had them on my mp3 player. The list was: 25. 'The River' - Bruce Springsteen (1980) 24. 'Nothing Compares 2 U' - Sinead O'Connor (1990) 23. 'No Surprises' - Radiohead (1997) 22. 'A Change Is Gonna Come' - Sam Cooke (1964) 21. 'Space Oddity' - David Bowie (1969) 20. 'That's the Way I've Always Heard It Should Be' - Carly Simon (1971) 19. 'Lost Cause' - Beck (2002) 18. 'I've Gotta Get a Message to You' - Bee Gees (1968) 17. 'Back to Black' - Amy Winehouse (2006) 16. 'Shilo' - Neil Diamond (1968) 15. 'My Mom' - Chocolate Genius (1998) 14. 'Anyone Who Had a Heart' - Dionne Warwick (1963) 13. 'Naked as We Came' - Iron & Wine (2004) 12. 'In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning' - Frank Sinatra (1954) 11. 'Brick' - Ben Folds Five (1997) 10. 'In the Real World' - Roy Orbison (1989) 9. 'Concrete Angel' - Martina McBride (2001) 8. 'Dance With My Father' - Luther Vandross (2003) 7. 'Hallelujah' - Jeff Buckley (1994) 6. 'He Stopped Loving Her Today' - George Jones (1980) 5. 'I Know It's Over' - The Smiths (1986) 4. 'Hurt' - Johnny Cash (2002) 3. 'Eleanor Rigby' - The Beatles (1966) 2. 'Gloomy Sunday' - Billie Holiday (1941) 1. 'Chicken Wire' - Pernice Brothers (1998) You can argue over whether the list has the saddest songs ever on it. In fact, if you clicked on the link above, you will have seen that the arguments went on and on and on and on for days. There are also a number of songs on this list that have already been mentioned\u2026Concrete Angel, for one. A horrendously sad, and beautifully sung song.  There are also some brilliant songs that may not deserve to be on a list of saddest songs, but I think are brilliant, such as Hallelujah, by Jeff Buckley  or Creep, by Radiohead  both are on my my list of all time favourite songs. However, I have brought this list up as it introduced me to two of the saddest songs I can think of, that haven't been mentioned: Firstly, at number one is Chicken Wire by Pernice Brothers.  I'd never heard this song before I tracked down all the songs on the list. It's superb, but very very sad. About a woman gasssing herself in the garage with a drink in her hand. The lyrics are: With a drink in her hand She will stop her car and then Seal herself for good in the garage She's never leaving There were times to be sure It was so pure you might choke But it's too late in the garage The falling ceiling And all the walls will fade to black Could she be thinking of another now Take my hand, pull me through There's so much i left undone But it's too late now in the garage And all the walls will fade to black Could she be thinking of another They found her car still running In the garage She'd come so far to end her life By the rusty mower and chicken wire By the chicken wire and studded tire By the rusty mower and chicken wire (Pernice Brothers) Finally, and I think truly the saddest, most beautiful song, is about a couple struggling with abortion (Brick (song) - Wikipedia). Brick, by Ben Folds Five\u2026  Another song, and band, I'd never heard of. A song I've listened to regularly ever since I found it. The lyrics are: Six am day after Christmas I throw some clothes on in the dark The smell of cold Car seat is freezing The world is sleeping I am numb Up the stairs to her apartment She is balled up on the couch Her mom and dad went down to Charlotte They're not home to find us out And we drive Now that I have found someone I'm feeling more alone Than I ever have before She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly They call her name at seven thirty I pace around the parking lot Then I walk down to buy her flowers And sell some gifts that I got Can't you see It's not me you're dying for Now she's feeling more alone Then she ever has before She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly As weeks went by It showed that she was not fine They told me son it's time to tell the truth She broke down and I broke down 'Cause I was tired of lying Driving home to her apartment For the moment we're alone She's alone I'm alone Now I know it She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly Love the song, but horribly sad.
