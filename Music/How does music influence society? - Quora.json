            "answer_text": "I would point you to the excellent documentary \u2018The History of Rock and Roll\u2019. All the singers from the 60\u2019s unanimously agree that their music was intended to change the world but all it really did was reinforce beliefs held by those who listened to it and agreed with it. In other words, a racist person is not going to listen to \u2018All You Need Is Love\u2019 and have an epiphany. People wrote a metric ton of protest songs aimed at George W. Bush and it changed nothing. People are writing songs about Trump now and it changes nothing. Willie Nelson has even expressed his disappointment with Trump and he probably has a ton of fans that voted for Trump. He says he\u2019ll likely lose them but he doesn\u2019t care. What music does do, however, is affect the way we dress. What we eat and drink. What car we drive. Where we live. All these things because somewhere deep down inside we all want to be like our favorite artists. Or maybe they are our favorite artists because they share our tastes. Who knows. ",

Come on you know that one song that you hear that is your\"anthem\u201d it speaks to you reminding you of who you are or want to be.alws you feel feeling and when you hear it you become \u2026. something.. more or different? Well what I'm saying is music is a part of the world. It absolutly influences every living thing on Earth.
