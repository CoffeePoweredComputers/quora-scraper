            "answer_text": "It is just my opinion and I think YES , he created the roast video to get views, attention and controversy. I think this because of: Timing of the video: Carryminati has not started roasting just now, he is doing it for many years. Kunal sees any issue with him then video must have come a long ago.Kunal is following Ajey aka Carryminati on Twitter : Is he following him for the content of his roast?? May be, he is following him for that only. \ud83d\ude02 Right now, this YouTube vs. Tiktok is going famous and he wanted to get some benefits out of this as this is the right time to roast Carryminati. Think of any other time will his video be trending if it is not for this time. I don't think so. Thanks for your time. Keep smiling \ud83d\ude42. Image Courtesy : Twitter ",
