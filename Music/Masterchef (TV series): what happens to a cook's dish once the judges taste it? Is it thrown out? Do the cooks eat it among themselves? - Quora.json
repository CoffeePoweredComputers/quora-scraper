Either the judges hide the dish under the podium before take it to the crew, or I might of notice someone like Christina one time lifted a dish and take it aside off screen. So, if there is any leftovers from a competition or unjudged items, the crew must be eating it. If not, they are wasting \u201cRestaurant-style\u201d dishes on Kraft Service tables. ",
