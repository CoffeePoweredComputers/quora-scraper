            "answer_text": "I'm not familiar with the extent of your issue, but I will say it seems your inner-you is trying to get your attention. I could be wrong, but beyond  temporary perception-altering chemicals, I don't think that there is a professional out there who will be able to help you more than you can for yourself. I get the doubting yourself, and as trite as this may sound, have you tried yoga? I know, it sounds silly, but I've actually experienced the practice of yoga calming my own anxieties. Furthermore, on your more high strung days, I'd avoid stimulants of all kinds (caffeine, tobacco, etc) just in case that was something you hadn't thought of yet. Regardless of what you experience, please know that it is just your thoughts that are causing you to feel out of control, and that can best be handled by breathing deeply and slowly, closing your eyes, and if you have freaky visions while your eyes are closed, try this out. I once heard that when you have a nightmare with a monster or something scary in it, go up to the thing in your dream and hug it, as tightly and fiercely as you can. I tried this later in my own dreams, and the thing disintegrated entirely and the badness of the dream ended. I guess the idea that makes this approach work is that we're effectively facing our fears head on with acceptance and appreciation when we hug them, which is the most healthy way to grow from any trauma. I hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely nothing to worry about. The fear of insanity is a very normal form of anxiety and is related to the other anxieties you mentioned. There are a whole cluster of them, from fearing you will kill your loved ones to fearing you are a pedophile, and what characterises them all - the only thing that characterises them all - is that they are nothing to worry about. The fact that you have the anxiety response is a clear indication that the fear you have is not a real danger. Because your fear is how your mind reacts to the perceived threat. If you feel fear and aversion - that is your brain rejecting those things, and guarding against them. The most protective mothers torture themselves worrying that they will harm or kill their child. That just shows how protective they are. They even mistrust themselves, just in case. In the case of you fearing \u2018losing your grip\u2019, this applies as much as with any other such fear. Although it doesn\u2019t feel like it, the anxiety and panic is proof of just how much grip you have. In fact, your brain is just gripping way too tight. You can relax a bit. A good analogy is to see your anxiety and panic as a fire alarm. It gets triggered way too easily and goes off for no reason over the littlest thing. But that is all the more reason for you to never fear a fire. You will have to put up with the alarm bells in your head, which is awful for you. And it will not make it easy to sleep at night. But you can rest assured you are 100 per cent safe. The photoreceptors in your eyes fire off randomly and most people don\u2019t even notice it unless you point it out to them. But if you are anxious, tired, stressed, or high on drugs - you do. It means nothing and has nothing to do with your mental health in any way whatsoever. It is a completely different part of your brain, the part that handles visual perception. Do not worry. It is ok. ",
