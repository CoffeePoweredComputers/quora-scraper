            "answer_text": "A tasty question, this. I don\u2019t know who Joe Pass\u2019 favorite guitarist was, but I do remember a little story about how his walking bass technique developed. I can\u2019t remember if he was in high school or college, but the ensemble he was playing in had no bassist. Joe started working in walking bass lines with his chord changes, creating a unique style that is still recognizable today. I think I might have to go have a little listen now\u2026 ",
