            "answer_text": "As far as I have ever experienced, CD-R recording isn\u2019t quite 80 minutes. The CD standard was originally set for 74 minutes maximum and that standard produces the most reliable burned CD\u2019s. With the advent of burners and CD media that was being used for other than audio use, the 700 MB disc evolved which allows almost 80 minutes of recording. I have recorded 79:56 but never was able to hit 80:00. ",
