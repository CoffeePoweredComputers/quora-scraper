            "answer_text": "By first impression you can say that it's a Love song but the Word \"Yellow\" actually doesn't have any meaning here. Read following paragraph for explanation - \"Yellow\" was written in a Rockfield studio in Wales called the Quadrangle, where Coldplay began working on their debut album, Parachutes. One night after finishing recording \"Shiver\", the lead single of the album, the band took a break and went out of the studio. Outside, there were few lights on and the stars in the sky were visible and \"just amazing\", according to the song's co-producer, Ken Nelson. He told the band to look at the stars, which they did. Vocalist Chris Martin was inspired by the sight and the song's main melody, consisting of a chord pattern, popped into his head. At first, Martin did not take it seriously \"as he relayed the tune to the rest of the band in his worst Neil Young impersonation voice\". ***Martin went on to further explain that the word \"yellow\" has absolutely no meaning whatsoever and while writing the rest of the song he tried his best to change yellow to something else since every lyric before yellow made no sense but in the end the word \"yellow\" just sounded right. Martin also told Stern that through the years depending on the attitude and manner of whoever interviews him, he would make up some story about a song or album titles just to move on to the next question. Martin applauded Stern saying \"I like you, Howard, so that's the first time I've ever told anyone the truth behind 'Yellow'.\"*** ...and guess what, I like his explanation that that Word Yellow really does NOT have any meaning but it still fits perfectly and feels good and People are coming up with their own interpretations and that's Good. As long as people can connect themselves, you have hit the right chords! My Interpretation: Yellow is the color of many things. Light, flowers, the sun and other stars, it represents happiness as well a illness in some cases. Yellow is a color that can mean many things and have many emotions. However, it is a primary color, therefore, one of the simplest colors. Just as true unconditionally love. It is unpredicatble and raw. It's simple yet profound. It's also infinite like the possibilities of yellow when it comes to what it can mean or what other colors you can make when you mix it. Yellow also comes in many shades and intensities just as love does. When you love someone you would \"bleed [yourself] dry for them\" and \"[their] skin and bones turn into somethng beautiful\" to you. This song is about unconditional love. The real type that everyone wants and deserves. The kind of love that is everything it wants or needs to be. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a lot of speculation that song yellow was written by Chris out of his admiration for Gwyneth Paltrow but the song was released in 2000 and Chris met Paltrow only in 2002 . Only the initial lines of yellow were penned by lead singer Chris Martin rest song was written by other the band members . Chris in a interview with Howard stern said that during the sound checking of the song \u2018shiver\u2019, he found a chord that sounded really good and he sang the line \u2018look at the star' in Neil young voice and then showed it to other band members. They all liked it and bit by bit song got developed. He also mentioned the word \u2018yellow\u2019 had no meaning it was a kind of filler he used. He said he would invent a story for it, which he actually did in VH1 interview he said that he was looking through the yellow pages and named the song after the book.  According to me the song may be about the author's undying love to his sick/dead partner. The reference to stars and below lines shows that \u201cYour skin and your bones Turn into something beautiful\u201d The lines \u201c I swam across I jumped across for you\u201d \u201ci\u2019d bleed myself dry\u201d shows how much love and devotion the author had for his lover But he adds the line \u201cwhat a thing to do\u201d at the end of every stanza showing that all the efforts he has taken has gone sour. The song could also be about one sided love. The line \u201c so then I took my turn What a thing to have done\u201d shows that he finally had courage to confess but it did not work out. Fun Fact: in Henry depiction of Dante and Beatrice, Beatrice was dressed in yellow. Maybe yellow had something to do with one sided love. Yellow in general is synonymous to warmth, pleasure so may be author was saying it was beautiful pain. ",
