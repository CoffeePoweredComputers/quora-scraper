Here\u2019s a few steps: Start learning, but don\u2019t practice, at all.Even if you practice, make sure the practice sessions get obstructed by phone calls and random fiddling with your smartphone.Start learning after 30Stop taking care of your guitarDon\u2019t watch any guitar tutorials on youtubeI always wanted to learn to play the guitar, but never got the time and opportunity to do it. Actually, it was more due to laziness instead of the other reasons I\u2019ve specified. Also, I had a hobby that effectively prevents people from spending time in other hobbies, e.g. video gaming. Eventually, when I did start taking lessons, I was in my 30s, and I found it very difficult to continue. First month was filled with enthusiasm and excitement; I bought an expensive nylon stringed Ibanez guitar, and I started practicing every day. But things started changing in the subsequent month. Me and 3 of my friends started together. All of us came from similar background, and we also were in the same age group. One of the main reasons for starting the classes was the group we had. We encouraged each other and held group practice sessions. Things evidently were not the same when one of us decided to quit. Eventually, only I survived\u2014the other three just faded away. I continued for a little longer, but then I, too, stopped going to the classes. After that, it became very difficult to stay motivated. I do pick up the guitar occasionally, but nothing comes out of it. I even started taking classes again, but that, too, went nowhere and I was out of there within another month or two. Now I am 35 years old and pretty much devoid of turning dream in to reality. I may not be able to learn to play the guitar in this lifetime. So don\u2019t do the things I have done, and you have a good shot at becoming an awesome guitar player. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, having a passion for music speeds up the process a lot, especially if you're having fun. I started my lifelong love for music from elementary school, playing the cheap plastic flutes they teach with there. Sure, what I played was nowhere impressive nor heart moving, but I was happy and entertained by it. Many days I would be seen sitting in the school yard, playing all sorts of music from pop to classic. In my junior high, I joined the Chinese music orchestra club and started learning to play the cello. As one could imagine, this club wasn't one of the popular clubs, and only had around 15 to 20 people in it. However, inspite to our small size, we were able to play and have tons of fun jamming together. Who said you can only play traditional Chinese music? The instrument you play doesn't limit you to what you can play. Finally, I joined a rock club in high school, at first as a drummer. I had a hard time learning it due to the fact that you can't take it home with you, so instead I borrowed a rusty abandoned guitar laying around the corner, strung some new strings on it and took it home. From there I was a fast learner, and soon exceeded my older schoolmates. Why? Because I didn't play to impress girls or for attention. I played for the fun of it, and when you're having fun, it numbs the pain from forming blisters. Tips: YouTube is a great media platform to find inspiration and all your favorite covers to learn.Start by learning songs that you like, simplify the songs if necessary.Don't play to impress, play to entertain yourself first. Birds of a feather flock together, and you will meet more and more music enthusiasts like yourself!",

            "answer_text": "To become a better guitar player, you have to be open to learning things you may not believe matter. While finger exercises are good (do not buy that POS spring loaded finger thing - it's crap and was debunked back in the 1980s when it came out), the best finger exercise is to play the guitar. Reading music is not critical to becoming a better guitar player, but it is critical to becoming a more versatile and capable, and employable guitar player in studio work and for \"orchestral\" playing gigs (no TAB there). All guitar players begin with basic open chords. But many only go on to learn basic Barre chords, the major and minor forms, and that is where it ends for them. If you really want to improve, to be better, you have to learn the \"jazz\" chords, all those other chords with the funny names like a 13b5b9 an stuff like that. And to make your chord knowledge really excel, you need to learn four different ways to play every chord you know - four differing forms (fingerings), because any given chord is everywhere on the neck. Scales are also important, the modes, pentatonic minor and pentatonic major, the harmonic minor, chromatic and whole tone scales are a good place to start. Rhythm is critical to understand. If you cannot capture the \"feel\" of a swing/shuffle, and do it right, you will never find the pocket, the groove a song requires which uses this feel. Tied to rhythm is time keeping skill. You have to know how to count things out so you will know when things happen, how to capture that elusive strum pattern (rhythm) being played by the guitar player you're listening to. So working with a metronome is very important (electronic, not pendulum). Get a stand alone metronome, so you're not a slave to your phone or computer ( which should be elsewhere than where you practice). All my students learn this stuff, and more, like multiple styles to see how things work because Rock doesn't cover every possibility to show how things work. Nor does Blues, or Jazz, or Pop... There's definitely more, of course. But this should give you a firm basis from which to draw to get you going in the right direction.

If you can't get something down, move on and come back to it. Because anything that you do whether it is easy or hard at first, it gets easier. Know the difference between practicing too much and not enough. If you miss a practice or two, it's okay. Don't procrastinate about it though.   Have at least one song to practice that you are passionate about at all times. If  you don't like to practice, you most likely won't choose to practice. And if you don't practice, you won't get better. Lastly, have a good attitude even if you can get a certain chord/chord progression down. Don't beat yourself up! Why? Because it doesn't help the situation. If you don't have a good attitude, then you won't enjoy playing. And that's why we all play- to enjoy the music.   ",

            "answer_text": "Like the obvious answer, practice, but.. it really depends on what you consider to be a good guitarist. Are you going for solo guitar, playing tunes and pieces with no singing and or other instrumentation. This type of playing requires quite a bit more study and is a bit more \u201cnaked\u201d if you will. Mistakes and stutters stand out more when it\u2019s just you playing your axe by itself. Now, if you want to be a good accompanying guitarist for your own singing or someone else, you might get away with a bit less polish. Having played guitar for many years, I have hit several plateaus where it just seemed like I was going nowhere. The key here, at least for me, was to just stick with it a bit longer. Learn an open tuning, try finger style, pick up a slide, learn a song outside of your comfort zone. I will switch to mandolin or ukulele as well, these will give you a new perspective on playing a stringed instrument. Also, find a local jam group, as this will push you along as well, playing with others especially someone more accomplished will help tremendously. Lessons from a professional will help in the beginning, avoiding some bad habits and learning some theory is always good. Above all, pickup you guitar EVERYDAY ! Just noodling around is fine too. If it\u2019s not any FUN, you will not get very good. Even if you don\u2019t and still have fun, then you have accomplished more than a lot of folks. Playing guitar is therapeutical, soothes your soul and will give you lifelong enjoyment. Peace Den ",

            "answer_text": "Passion for music , dedication to learn and practice are the three main prerequisites to play decent guitar. When you will start to play guitar, you will probably go to a professional guitarist or will buy a book which will give you some basics. Whatever may be the case the first few weeks is going to be a challenge for you, and that is the time when most people give up. In the beginning you will find yourself stuck into practicing basics and getting your fingers accustomed to the string and learning the theoretical part , while others like your trainer or your friends are playing some fancy chords and music.Don't let this demotivate you. Just survive first 3 or 4 months with the practice then you will find that you have found yourself a new companion that will stay with you forever , learning will be so much fun and you will be too excited every time you hear something new or somebody playing something new. You are sad, you will search your guitar, your are happy , scared or anxious whatever may be the emotion , it will be there for you Just the feeling that you can play guitar will give you so much happiness that cannot be defined. So start your practice now and Happy learning. ",

Also, listen to plenty of music. A wise man once said that the late Johnny Winter played more guitar than anybody else because he listened to more guitar than anybody else. So for today, here is some nice playing to listen to by yours truly. Enjoy, and excuse the plug! NEVER GOING BACK AGAIN -originally recorded by Fleetwood Mac ",

This enables you to pick individual artists you\u2019d hope to emulate and learn from. Then watch YouTube or other Internet sites to watch carefully as your favorite artists perform. This also is goal-oriented practicing and playing. Find tutorials that best motivate you and inform you in the styles you\u2019ve chosen. Don\u2019t waste time idling or noodling with your guitar. Don\u2019t call it practice if you\u2019re lying on the sofa, or watching TV. Rather, start each practice with a goal or goals in mind. I have never had any problem devoting time to practicing guitar, because I enjoy it so much, but I know of guitarist friends who\u2019ve scheduled time each day to play. And they set deadlines to get ready for performances or make recordings. So set goals, manage your time and for inspiration, always go back to the guitar masters you\u2019ve chosen to study and grow toward. ",

But, above all else, we have to want it, we have to desire to be good and this provides the emotional energy you need to aspire and to continually improve. We need to want guitar playing so badly that we cannot allow it to fade away or dwindle into being yet another \u2018hobby\u2019. Guitar is a calling, a way of life and we must want it very much. ",

When we get up, when we go to bed, eat, etc. We decide everything in our personal lives. So if you want to become a good guitar player, you first must decide to. Then once the decision is made, you set out to acquire the tools necessary to get you there. A guitar (obviously) some learning material (books youtube videos, friends who play guitar etc) and if at all possible, a good guitar tutor. The last thing can make a world of difference. Why? Because a good guitar tutor that you make a connection with can teach you things that will help you overcome your learning curve. Help you to progress faster with short cuts from personal experience. A good tutor you make a connection with can make you feel good about learning and make you want to continue your study for years to come. Which will make you become a good guitarist.

You\u2019ll get as good as you want to be at whatever you want to be if you start making any kind of accomplishment in that field. So with guitar, start making simple accomplishments, and you will also be making progression. Then simply keep accomplishing what you want until you feel sufficiently accomplished. I should note that you might discover that your goals may turn out to be overly-ambitious ones. The only way you will be able to continue making accomplishments is to make those goals smaller. The advice I give to my students is, if you allot an hour for practice, set a goal that you think that you can accomplish in 5 minutes. Then if you feel like playing more, go right ahead, you have allotted yourself the time; why not? If not, then put it down, you accomplished something anyway. I hope this helps, and good luck. ",

After he finished playing a song in his guitar, she asked him what would it take to be able to play the guitar. His answer was: It takes three things: 1 - You have to have a guitar. So if you don\u2019t have one yet, go buy one. 2 - You have to like your guitar. If you don\u2019t like it you won\u2019t play it. 3 - The most dificult part: you have to make the guitar like you. ",
