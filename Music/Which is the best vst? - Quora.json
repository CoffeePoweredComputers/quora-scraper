            "answer_text": "There\u2019s no such thing as \u201cbest vst\u201d. There are so many out there, in different categories, doing all sorts of things. If you\u2019re talking about audio processing vsts, the ones from Waves have long been considered the industry standard. Lately they seen to be matched or surpassed by Universal Audio or, to a lesser extent, Slate audio, due to their nice analog gear emulations. VST instruments on the other hand usually depend on what kind of music/instruments you\u2019re looking for. Spectrasonics and Arturia are famous for their synth instruments, Vienna and EWQL have VSTIs for playing their beautiful and huge symphonic libraries. I guess the closer to a \u201cstandard\u201d here would be Native Instruments Komplete library, which comes with lots of different synths and samplers (including Kontakt, probably the most used sampler around for some decades now) ",

            "answer_text": "Best VST is a horribly broad and rather heavily argued upon opinion. It doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. I personally think that if you are looking for a specific kind of VST, you should narrow it down to either a VSTi or a VST effect. In terms of VSTi, I personally recommend Xfer Serum. It is a synth that can do ANYTHING you need (in terms of sound synthesis). It is a useful tool; I personally use it in all of my projects. If you are looking for a sampler, I would use Kontakt, although some of its libraries are fairly CPU intensive. I think that the best ROMpler is either reFX Nexus or Omnisphere. In terms of VST effects, your stock effects should be enough if you are getting started. If you are looking at purchasing stuff, I would recommend Universal Audio and Waves, although in my opinion, Waves is pretty overpriced. In conclusion, best VST is a rather broad question. These are my picks for the best VSTis and VST effects. Thanks for Reading! ",
