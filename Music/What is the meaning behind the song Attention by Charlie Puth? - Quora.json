In his song \u2018Attention\u2019 by yours truly Charlie Puth He talks about his ex-girlfriend who is jealous and hungry for his attention. She follows him every where he goes Now, Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd call you up You've been going round, going round, going round every party in LA 'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd be at one This lyric she is stalking him like a jealous ex wherever he goes. I know that dress is karma, perfume regret You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect But you're not coming home with me tonight In this lyric he is trying to tell her to leave him alone as they willingly never ever be together anymore. You just want attention You don't want my heart Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new Yeah, you just want attention I knew from the start You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you Throughout the song he is telling her different reasons as to why it over and will remain that way that she should stop \u270b doing things to attract his attention. And the song keeps on repeatin\u2026.. I hope you understood better\u2026. P.S. Don\u2019t forget to touch that nice arrow button\u2026. You will get free virtual chocs. THANK YOU.

            "answer_text": "This song is very neatly written with soothing music and very catchy lyrics. \u201cAttention\u201d song is one of my favourites. Meaning of song Attention : This depicts that even after their breakup the girl is all over boy\u2019s mind and life. She reminds him of the time when they were together. Boy says that the girl just wants his attention and not his love, he assumes that she might not like if he\u2019ll date someone else. She goes to every party possible in LA, as she knew she might find the boy in one of them. Boy simply doesn't like this. ",
