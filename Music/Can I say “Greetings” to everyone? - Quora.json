            "answer_text": "You could if you chose to. There is no one technically stopping you from greeting people in this way. If you are asking whether you should, that depends on the impression that you want to give off. Many people find unexpected phrases as a turn-off, but others would find it refreshing. In a professional context, many people begin their emails with \u201cGreetings,\u201d yet will never say it in person. People tend to be more uncomfortable with verbal deviations from the normal than with written deviations. It would help if you had more context for the situation that you are in, because certain scenarios demand certain types of behavior and etiquette. In addition, are you combining this \u201cGreetings\u201d with a humorous alien-like voice? Context could make a big difference in how well-received this statement is. ",

As for me,, I send my Greetings in written form - I don*t use this word when greeting someone viva - voce. Of course , saying * Greetings to everyone* is not actually a blatant mistake - but it is not so adequate like, say * Hi everyone! * Again, *Greetings to everyone* can be rather a written form (in a letter, book etc.) - while * Hi everyone* is the viva-voce (verbal) equivalent expression ",

I am assuming you are in a situation where it is normal to say \u201cHello\u201d or \u201cHow are you\u201d, for example if you enter a store and encounter a clerk you know. However, if you say \u201cGreetings\u201d to every person you pass on the street, some will think it strange. If people I know say that to me, I would especially appreciate it since they chose to say something different. ",

Better to say hi, hello, good morning/afternoon, or g\u2019day if it is to be casual or semi-casual. However, using \u201cGreetings\u201d as a salutation for cards or letters is not so much frowned upon. ",
