            "answer_text": "Simply, old movies are from a different era. When spoken dialogue started appearing in movies around 1928, virtually all of the screenwriters came from Broadway, and many theatrical plays were adapted for the movies. Dialogue had to be spoken clearly and distinctly in the theater-there were no microphones or speakers in theaters in the 1920\u2019s to 1940\u2019s. Your voice alone had to carry in a 1000 to 1500 seat theater. Many films in the 1930\u2019s starred ex-Broadway actors-it took years for the older actors to adapt to the camera and microphone. It is somewhat the same problem opera singers faced making recordings. Opera singers always (even mostly to today) had no amplification other than their own bodies and technique. Virtually all opera singers, especially singing popular type songs, are almost always singing in a \u201cstiff\u201d style that does not come across well. When they sang in opera houses, it was the only way to sing. When opera singers record popular songs, their style does not suit the medium. Film actors in the earliest days (1908 to around 1915), acted in an \u201coperatic\u201d style-they over-emoted because they did not understand the power of closeups in film. Later film actors adapted to the camera, and realized that \u201cless is more\u201d. It was the same way with dialogue in \u201ctalkies\u201d. Of course, this all depended on the individual actor-many actors spoke very naturally right from the early 1930\u2019s. There are many, many films in the 1930\u2019s and 1940\u2019s with very naturalistic dialogue and delivery. Remember, Broadway in the 1920\u2019s was a \u201cGolden Era\u201d for drama and comedy, and most of those brilliant writers came to the movies starting in the 1930\u2019s, and continued into the 1950\u2019s. Another reason why people might feel the dialogue in old movies is \u201cstiff\u201d is simply that they have not seen very many older movies, and cannot accept the movies for being of their own time. They are just startled because it sounds different, not because it is inferior. Remember, if you have only heard modern music, rap, hip hop, etc, you will certainly feel that Beethoven, Brahms, Bach, Chopin, Liszt and Wagner are also \u201cstiff\u201d compared to Justin Bieber.

            "answer_text": "For the most part, before the 1950s, actors were trained to deliver dialogue sharply and clearly rather than concentrate on emotional response. Typical acting lessons would focus on diction and clear speaking rather than how the lines sounded to an outside observer. Things started changing in the 1950s when new acting schools concentrated on showing emotion rather than dialogue. There were different approaches to how this could be done, but at its essence actors were either told to remember the emotional response they were trying to emulate, or to try to immerse themselves in their character. The concentrated less on dialogue and more on facial expression and body movement. This style started to be preferred by directors and many actors who had grown up in a \u201cfocus on diction\u201d environment adapted to it. ",
