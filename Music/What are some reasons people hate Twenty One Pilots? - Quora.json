            "answer_text": "They got overplayed, let\u2019s be honest.Some of their least impressive songs were their hits, giving a bad impression. (I actually love Stressed Out, but Heathens was really meh.)A lot of people don\u2019t want to have to think while listening to music. They listen for it for a catchy beat, and not deep lyrics.Christian lyrics. Not everyone wants religion in their music (albeit TOP does it in a way non-Christians can still understand/enjoy.)The clique insists that they are the best band to ever have existed, and if you don\u2019t agree with them, you\u2019re WRONG.Fake fan bullshit. Grow up.Not falling into a lot of trends/cliches/stereotypes/genres. They\u2019re really weird. Not everyone wants weird.Depressing lyrics. Sometimes, you just want something to jam out in the car. You cant really do that with Isle of Flightless Birds.People get upset when they get mixed into their genre. I\u2019ve seen so many rock fans get mad with TOP for not being \u201creal\u201d rock. They\u2019re not trying to be. Same goes for rap.General dislike of anything considered emo. And yes, TOP are very, very emo. (I don\u2019t even consider P!ATD or stuff like that emo.)",

            "answer_text": "Personally, if I found out they were getting preachy after I\u2019ve seen them talk about wanting the music to be accessible to all, I would be turned off. I like Holding Onto You but I get a very almost Christian Rock vibe from it. Which is still fine if it\u2019s not explicitly in the lyrics or confirmed by the band that the message is other than what it sounds like on the surface- learning to believe in yourself and take your life back after hardships. But I just like them, they\u2019re fun, the lyrics are clever, the band writes it\u2019s own material. Enjoyable so far. Even I\u2019m almost sick of Stressed Out a bit. Like that X Ambassadors song that found it\u2019s way into a commercial. Ruined. But I think of TOP like Imagine Dragons. It\u2019s just good and I like it. They\u2019ve both done some really empowering songs, and some that I listen to when I know I can\u2019t shake a shitty mood. I like listening to something and knowing that it wasn\u2019t written to grab attention, that it had a purpose and meant just as much to the performer as myself. BTW, anyone remember Skillet? Did you know they *were* a Christian band? A lot of the songs are inspired by faith, but you\u2019d never know it. So if TOP can toe the line in keeping their music relatable I\u2019ll probably keep listening unless they really get overplayed. ",
