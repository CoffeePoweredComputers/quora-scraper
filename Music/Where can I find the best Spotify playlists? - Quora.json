I wish people made more stuff like this - just good songs for people to discover - instead of compiling things like \"All new music from this morning\" or \"One-hit wonders from 1982.\" You can find it at http://open.spotify.com/user/mayaafish/playlist/7n0Ek9UwzALRtnfMJN5Dgf ;) ",

He offers lists that update to reflect new recommendations from Pitchfork, BBC6, NPR, as well as thematic lists (eg, Children of Morricone, a list reflecting a variety of spaghetti western-inspired tunes across a wide breadth of generes).  Its an incredible resource I've recommended t all my friends joining Spoitfy. ",
