            "answer_text": "It needs to be recorded and put on fixed media like a CD. With a marking pen or label making device you post the title of the song and the words Copyright \u00a9\u2117 2020 and your name. Make sure you include the circled C and P) If you have sold or given away copies that could be considered \u201cpublishing.\u201d The same applies if you put it on a streaming service like YouTube, Spotify or Apple Music. If you have sold or posted copies for others to take it can still be considered as \u201cunpublished\u201d if they were done for demonstration purposes, such as sending them to a singer to get them to cover the song. The law gives YOU the first right to record and perform the song. Once the song has been published or distributed to people at large any other performer can LICENSE the song through the US Copyright Office or a service like the Harry Fox Agency IF you have assigned Harry Fox to be your agent (you get 9 cents per CD the new artist PRESSES - $90 for 1,000 $900 for 10,000, etc.). YOU can also \u201csource\u201d license the song to anyone you want at any terms, but those should be in writing. If you think the song might stream on a service like Apple Music or Spotify (because you have placed it there) or get played college radio or local radio you should consider joining Broadcast Music, Inc. I suggest them because they allow you to get both the songwriter share and publisher share. ASCAP requires you formally sign as a publisher and pay a one-time fee. The chances of you seeing any money from this is minimal unless the song gets played on radio, TV or motion pictures. A single logging on college radio won\u2019t even get you $1. Make sure you tell all services, such as Spotify, that the music is copyrighted in your name and if you do go with BMI include those initials after your name. There are two kinds of formal copyrights. Published and unpublished. A SINGLE WORK (music, lyrics and sound recording) by a SINGLE AUTHOR (you and only you) is $35 for either PUBLISHED or UNPUBLISHED. You might still be able to register an album of songs, provided it has ONE TITLE (single work) and ONE AUTHOR for the same price. If there is more than one author the price is $55. If you register by mail using paper forms the price is $85. You can also register a group of 10 UNPUBLISHED songs, music and lyrics for $55. (These prices could go up at any time, that were what I found as of this writing.) You need a credit card or debit card to pay online. For mail registrations you fill out a form and must include a check or money order for the $85 or current fee. You must include ONE COPY of a CD with mail registrations for UNPUBLISHED work and TWO COPIES for PUBLISHED WORKS. For online registration they will want a digital file and they accept most common audio files such as MP3, MP4, WAVE, AUFF, WMA, etc. If your work is published or unpublished ONLINE only you can just send the audio file. If your work is PUBLISHED in the form of a CD or DVD you must send two hard copies of the CD to the Library of Congress using a form and label they will let your printout. As an alternative if you don\u2019t have a recording but do have at least a LEAD SHEET (showing the melody notes with the words sung written below) you can register that LEAD SHEET or full SHEET MUSIC with a different form (PA) but this ONLY PROTECTS the words and music to the song, not any given sound recording or recorded performance. Form SR covers both. IF you did your song as a video (Music Video) where YOU (and you alone) produced the video, wrote the song, music and lyrics and performed it. SINGLE TITLE, SINGLE AUTHOR. This must be submitted as a video file online in most formats including MP4, MOV, AVI, MPG, MWV, SWF. For paper forms mailed in it should be as a DVD or Blue Ray. The studio, recording engineer, and producer DO NOT count for authorship or names on registrations UNLESS YOU MADE ARRANGEMENTS IN WRITING GIVING THEM A PIECE OF THE OWNERSHIP. If you do this as published it would be best to use a label making system for your CDs and DVDs along with some type of printed cover with your name, the song name and the copyright notice with the \u00a9\u2117 and year. It\u2019s kinda cheesy to send a handwritten CD to the copyright office made with a sharpie, but if that\u2019s all you have do it. Just remember to put the copyright notice, year and your name on it, along with BMI if you join. If you think you might get played on Apple, Google Tunes, Spotify or YouTube you also might want to look into Sound Exchange. They pay money to record labels (and if you\u2019re producing and distributing this song, you are the record label) for streaming airplay. That is supposed to go to the performers, so if you had backup musicians or singers they are supposed to get a share of that along with you (but they don\u2019t get any rights in the song, unless you gave them rights in writing). Generally speaking the songwriter is the person who created the melody that is played or sung, and the lyrics that were written by the same person or another person. They are what is sung in that melody. Rhythm guitar, bass, drums are NOT a part of the songwriting process unless the creator of the song GIVES THEM RIGHTS in writing. (Once you give rights away you can\u2019t get them back unless they agree to give them back in writing.) When people write in tandem, like a singer who works with a guitarist who plays chords. They share rights as a courtesy, unless the guitarist LED the singer in a new direction with a chord. Then that guitarist is part of the creative team. If they just find the chords and play along, they are simply back up. I worked with a singer who made up lyrics and melody to a chord structure originated by the guitarist, so they shared music writing and she got lyric writing all to herself. The musical composer(s) and lyric writer(s) share the songwriter\u2019s share 50/50 divided among them either equally or by contractual agreement. John Lennon and Paul McCartney by agreement shared their songwriting money equally, even if only one of them wrote the entire song and that happened a lot. Desperate songwriters sometimes allow producers and major artists to share in the songwriting and publishing as a part of the deal to record the song. You do this on a need basis, and it must be with a major artist on a major label. ASCAP and BMI frown on this, but it is done in order to get a song out there. The actual songwriter should try to keep the lion\u2019s share of the writing money. It is a different story giving away part of the publishing. In the \u201cold days\u201d the songwriters never expected to get any of that publisher share. Today many of them get as much as 90% of the publishing, however the record label and their publishing arm always likes to get a share, if not the entire amount. Rather than giving away songwriting credit and money to band members, if you can give them some of the publishing. It is generally frowned upon by ASCAP and BMI for songwriters to sell or give away all their monetary rights in a song. This has happened when a given artist was destitute and things like this can end up in court battles.

            "answer_text": "I cant say about other countries- some have laws and some dont. American laws are different from most anywhere else, so we have two main entities to protect everyone world wide. American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) is an organization that protects over half a billion artists and contributors world wide. Broadcast Music Inc. (BMI) does the same thing but is focused on music. Basically, when you consider a piece as being complete- Maybe you\u2019ve written a book, or developed a cool new font to be used in advertisement to represent a company or entity, maybe it is a song or just a poem, whatever. You then want to make a few copies of that work. One copy will be mailed to the U.S. Library of congress, and registered as a copywritten work (for a fee). Then you need to publish the work. This legally requires going through a publishing company which you can apply to, or create your own publishing company to handle it. Then, if it has to do with music, you send a copy and register it with either ASCAP or BMI or even both. IF YOU DO NOT REGISTER A PUBLISHING COMPANY the either ASCAP or BMI will take over as publisher and you will get only the authors royalties when your work is sold. If you do have the publisher, then they get a payment for their interest in the work. (So if you own it you get the full royalty, if you dont you only get half). The third copy of your work should be stored somewhere safe such as a bank deposit box or a lawyer or somewhere like that. This way, if there is ever a dispute you will have the Library of congress, a copyright agency, a copy of the original untampered work and possibly even a lawyer to stand up for you and prove you are the rightful owner. Interestingly enough, a lot of big name bands take on entities known as holding companies. These holding companies secure all the financial interests and physical property including copyright ownership and payment information. ",
