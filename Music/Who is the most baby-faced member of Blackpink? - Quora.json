            "answer_text": "A baby face is when someone has a very youthful, cute face. It\u2019s defined by certain traits. Having a baby face mostly depends on having a \u2018flat\u2019 bone structure. This means that the bone structure isn\u2019t very prominent; a baby face doesn\u2019t have a defined jawline or sharp cheekbones. The overall appearance of the face is soft and cute. This is partly why baby faces are more common among East Asians. Our faces generally have more \u2018neotenous\u2019 features and a flatter bone structure. Other traits include a short and round face shape; slightly puffy cheeks; a round nose; a low nose bridge and petite lips. Having perfect, smooth skin also makes you look more youthful and therefore baby-faced. JISOO  Jisoo doesn\u2019t really have a baby face. She does have cute petite lips, but she also has a defined jawline, slim face, pointed nose and a relatively high nose bridge. Therefore, her overall appearance is very elegant and pretty but not baby-faced. ROS\u00c9  Ros\u00e9 has a \u2018softer\u2019 face than Jisoo, because she less defined cheekbones, puffier cheeks and a lower nose bridge. However, her face is too long to be considered a baby face, and she has a super sharp jawline. Her nose is also quite pointed. LISA  Lisa has a cute and doll-like face, but I wouldn\u2019t describe it as baby-faced. She has a short, round face with slightly puffy cheeks and a round nose, however, she also has quite large lips, a sharp jawline and relatively high nose bridge. JENNIE  Jennie has an adorable baby face. She has all the traits: a short, round face; cute, puffy cheeks cheeks; a round nose; low nose bridge and petite lips. In conclusion, Jennie is the most baby-faced member of Blackpink!  Thank you for reading! ",

            "answer_text": "Rose Definitely. She has the facial features that make her look as if she is super young. She sorta has aeygo sal. (Sorry if I spelled that wrong) Her eyes are soft and her face is super cute.  She has baby like cheeks and a cute like smile, making her look like the maknae of the group. But I guess you could say Jennie does too.   Yes, she makes aeygo sal. But Jisoo is cute in her own way, and she may look baby faced depending on her photo shoot:  Yep she has aeygo sal. So I guess you could make the descion out of these photos based on what you think. Oh yeah, I can add Lisa for ya too.  Basically, they all have cute baby faces. But here\u2019s my order from the one with the babyish face of them all. RoseJisooJennieLisaI hope this helps!!!!\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4c ",
