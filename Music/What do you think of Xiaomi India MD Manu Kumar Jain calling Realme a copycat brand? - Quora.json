So what matters is who does it better. People wants best and forgets rest. No one cares who copies who. And realme is doing great job. That should be appreciated instead of getting criticized ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019 think Realme is copying Xiaomi in any way. They are producing their own phones while Xiaomi is producing their own phones by using parts from other manufacturers like SONY, SAMSUNG,SNAPDRAGON,MEDIATEK,etc. Every company has got the right to use their parts in their phones. Oneplus,Vivo,Oppo,Lenovo,Motorola and many other companies use the same processor in their phones. That doesn\u2019t mean they are copying each other. ",
