            "answer_text": "Heres how and why these fandoms are so annoying and toxic. Every fandom has their toxic side but since I\u2019m going to present what those toxic sides are, since I\u2019m apart of them. I stan all of the groups below I\u2019m just stating the toxic sides that I\u2019ve seen in these fandoms. Armys=Obessive Annoying Misogyny competitiveness  The biggest problem with Army are the obsessive annoying and misogynistic fans. Constantly spamming non related posts about BTS and always trying to get them related into something. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u201cstream dynamite\u201d but I\u2019ve seen army\u2019s spam on the wrong times, plus the whole entire \u201cwell maybe if you streamed(insert bts song) I\u2019ve seen Army\u2019s say that to people who have literally lost their family members. Overall it\u2019s just annoying spamming BTS onto things that are just complexity unrelated to them. Don\u2019t get me even started on the misogyny in this fandom, even though most of the fandom are women. They constantly body shame and tried to bash girl groups. Especially I.U, just because Jungkook said she was his type. Don\u2019t get me even started with the blackpink-antis. I love the boys an want to support them as much as I can but that doesn\u2019t need to be in a way of spamming or bringing down other groups for them. They always want BTS to be on \u201ctop\u201d which I mean which fans don\u2019t want their group and I don\u2019t blame fellow army\u2019s for wanting that but they don\u2019t need to bring down other groups to do so. Blinks=Too many Akgaes/competitiveness towards BTS  i love blackpink, all of them, but there\u2019s a reason why Jisoo has the reputation in the kpop community of being the \u201cunderrated member\u201d literally jisoo gets more love and support from other fandoms then her actual fanbase. The fact that she\u2019s the least followed member of blackpink, always gets the least lines, always has the most boring outfits, YG obvious picking favorites here to grab in the cash instead of treating all the members fairly. Oh god, don\u2019t get me started on the Lisa akgaes. I love Lisa she\u2019s talented and beautiful but her akgaes are absolutely horrible. They constantly bring down and hate on other members to uplift Lisa. The fact that there\u2019s a 11-million gap between Lisa\u2019s and Jisoo followers is insane. Of course there\u2019s the members who are more popular then the others but I feel as if there\u2019s more akgaes of blackpink then actual blinks. You can have your favorite/ there\u2019s a reason why there\u2019s such a thing called a \u201cbias\u201d but you have to remember to support the whole entire band! Blackpink already gets enough hate as it is yet the fandom decides to constantly bring down other members. This doesn\u2019t just apply to Lisa akgaes but she had the most in my opinion amongst all the members. Another problem they have is their constant wanting to \u201ctop\u201d BTS. They always try to compare them and try to bring them down not to say army hasn\u2019t done the same but I feel as if there\u2019s a difference between how both fandoms get into fandom wars. Blinks do it more as a competitiveness way while army does it as a defense of BTS. Blinks want BLACKPINK to \u201ctop\u201d BTS whilst Army\u2019s do it because they don\u2019t want blackpink to \u201ctop\u201d BTS. Onces-Misogyny towards other groups  again this fandom is mainly full of women yet they constantly bring down girl groups, especially blackpink. I feel that some of them are \u201csalty\u201d and \u201cjealous\u201d that the fact BLACKPINK is considerably more popular then twice now. Even though their not as popular BLACKPINK their still pretty popular. Overall once\u2019s are pretty cool and chill, they don\u2019t do the constant spamming and compare the members. EXOl-Competitiveness against BTS  same problem with TWICE expect with BTS. I remember they tried to join \u201cforces\u201d with blinks to bring down BTS for no reason. Spamming on their posts constantly. I remember that EXO was considerably the most popular boyband, but just because they no longer doesn\u2019t make them less popular. i feel there\u2019s also a bit of favoritism in their fandom as well. Not exactly akgaes but favoritism, Specifically chanyeol, Sehun,Baekhyun and Kai. Not exactly the same as Blinks but just more favoritism overall that\u2019s okay. NCTizens -Competitiveness, and lack of care for other members  Okay I\u2019ve already gotten into the competitiveness topic multiple times so I\u2019m just going to skip to the lack of care for other members. So again not the same as blinks but it\u2019s more of a they focus their light on other members/groups of NCT more then others. Not to say the bash other parts of NCT but more of focus their time on other groups/members more. So those members kind of.. drift into the background. I mean I don\u2019t exactly blame them, I mean imagine stanning a group with 21(soon to be 23) members. Overall same problems as other groups with the competitiveness. Moomoos-Lack of accountability for Hwasa  In my opnion Moomoos don\u2019t have the same competitiveness as other fandoms because of loving the way you look and creating your own beauty standard message that comes from Mamamoo. The biggest problem with moomoos is their lack of accountability for Hwasa. Pretty sure the you all are educated on her actions so I won\u2019t get into it. People making excuses left and right and some moomoos even saying she\u2019s part black? What? You can stan and love your favs but you have to hold them for accountability no matter how lovable they are. Put your morals before kpop! ReVeluv-Lack of accountably for Wendy/Competitiveness For what I\u2019ve seen the competitiveness is healthy. They want red relvet to succeed but from at least from what I\u2019ve seen they haven\u2019t done any crazy shit to bring down other girl groups. Now for Wendy, pretty you all are educated about her actions so ya same thing what I said about Hwasa. I my opinion I don\u2019t think Wendy is racist, or has any hate towards black people but I wished she would\u2019ve taken back her disgusting stereotyping statements back and apologized. I think she\u2019s ignorant but nor racist. Stray Kids-Has toxic fans but doesn\u2019t have exactly a toxic side From what I\u2019ve seen I feel like Stays are the least toxic out of most popular kpop fandoms. I feel like the reason why is because most of their fans are made up of of other fandoms. Exols,Nctizens,Army, etc. Why would Stays bash other bands their also apart off. Overall they can be toxic, example some stays trying to defend Woojin situation but overall I didn\u2019t see that many. Most tried to exceed Woojin out of stray kids. Pretty chill fandom, from my perspective at least. If you\u2019ve encountered toxic strays comment. overall these are all groups I stan. These are my opnions no hate towards any of the groups themselves. Every fandom has a toxic side no matyer how nice it can seem there will always be those fan. This is just a explanation on the toxic sides of each fandom I\u2019ve been apart or at least from what I\u2019ve seen. If you have any further commentary go ahead. Remember, groups who have more fans will also have more toxic fans. Overall good day, btw this post took me like a hour to write. ",

But i have met a bunch of loona stans online and in school, other places etc. And personally im very annoyed with them because they are always saying \u201cSTAN LOONA\u201d i get that you want to support your faves and i appreciate that, but when you get mad because someone (like me) says \u201cNo thank you\u201d its problematic. Let people try out groups at their own pace, girl i aint ready to stan another talented group.\u2014\u2014 Back to our regular schedule* -Exo\u2019ls (Exo fans) -Reveluvs (Red velvet) SOME ARE SO DAMN IGNORANT LIKE BITCH [POOR SEULGI AND IRENE MY GIRLS HAVE TO HAVE SUCH FANS] (Sorry) -Wannables Wanna One (Im crying inside, daEhwI) ^A lot of fans are annoying and childish and thats the tEa *MY TEACHER JUST SAID CLOSE YOUR LAPTOPS ILL BE BACK MY CHILDREN -Blackjacks (2NE1) ^I have seen an unholy amount of immature fans i swear just look it up or something \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 THIS IS NOT RELEVANT TO THE POST BUT I JUST READ A COMMENT ABOUT MY BOYS NCT AND THE FAN SAID \u201cI don't like their lightstick because it looks like a meat tenderizer.\u201d I CANT BREATHE DLEWGDLWEU  CLC fans^ They always throw shit at (G)-Idle like calm down, both are talented as fuck, its not (G)-Idles fault that they debuted more recently when k-pop was more relevant worldwide while CLC debuted years back.

            "answer_text": "True I was a huge part of the BTS fandom from 2015 to 2019 and stopped because I got tired of getting attacked by other army. If I posted a comment on any social media platform there would be some army that had negative things to say. Even on Weverse they don't support each other and encourage each other. A fan base that large should respect each other's opinions and not disagree so easily. In the end they should be a team working in favor of BTS and Not be cruel to someone for not having the same bias or because you are streaming another groups new song. (Showing love for a less successful group should be encouraged I think.) I still follow the guys as a group and I'm very happy for the success they've had in music but I don't consider myself an army because I had to many bad experiences in the fandom. I'm not the only person from my group of friends to leave the fandom from to much negativity \u201cfellow fans\u201d don't have any respect. I had followed the boys closely on social media and did everything I could to help them grow as a group.. I left from the cruelty of other Army that is what I respond every time I'm asked about being a army. There seems to be a lot of delusional fans in that group as well. I've seen a lot of threats of self harm and other terrible things over childish stuff. They are just mere men and not gods. Idol is the job they choose they all live by a contract and when said contract is over they don't have to keep a social media presence or keep the fan base around. So many fans would attack me when I refused to get dramatic over the fact the guys won't be bts forever. Just like all other famous singer songwriters in history they will grow up and move on from this. There's millions of fans in that group who think they will grow old watching new Bangtan bombs and the guys will be performing for decades. If you mention it they will really blow up on you. ",

After a while of being an Army I started recognizing the weird toxic love hate, frienemy attitude that army has not only towards other groups/fanbasses but even to BTS . Army are always really protective and caring towards BTS but this includes making the slightest Interaction,comment and action to become a big deal and if you don't believe me when I say that Army isn't only toxic to other people but to BTS themselves I would be happy to talk about when Army dragged Jungkooks friend because of some silly pictures of them together what is he not allowed to have friends anymore?!? If that isn't enough remember when Jungkook revealed his Tattoo and instead of being supportive and nice the whole fandom started making up stories and theories about it ? Lets do better in 2020 ok?

It just suddenly all turned into a competition. Firstly people bashing bts for having toxic fans but only say that because they have a larger fan base. Also there are bts fans that literally come at anybody who says something bad about bts. Blackpink fans just literally going on twitter and spamming hate comments on other groups. They also make fun of other kpop groups and if some other group wins they try to pick out anything that happened for example the scandel where they said nancy from momoland was glaring at bp that wasn\u2019t necessary. Third onces just start hating on people that like bp for some reason. I know somebody that is once and all she does is curse at bp for surpassing twice and literally trying to pull them down. ExoL just start pulling people down that is above them and like trying to say that exo is the best boy group and how bts can never fill a stadium. Nctzens keep saying that the subunits aren\u2019t part of nct and those solo stans and trying to kick taeyong out of the group like why? And basically if you stan a group someone says something bad about them people will come after you. ",

Some kpop stans make fun of people for staning bts , they say that bts are boring , ( some kpop stans , not all of them ) who's being toxic now , armies ??? And another thing , don't give an excuse that you left staning the group only from the fandom , are you staning the fandom or the group . Did bts hurt you , I don't think so .

So they just get stuck with this boy group and they don't think clear about the existence of other groups too. Also many of them believe that BTS=KPOP that is completely wrong. But it\u2019s ok. Its just like what happened with justin bieber. he had many fans (mainly young ones) and as time passed his fans got bored of him and searched for new \u2018\u2019idols\u2019\u2019. Of course you can find a few BTS fans who are fine and no-toxic. But sadly they are not many. ",

ONCE and SONEs are at war because Girls Generation debuted WAAAAY before Twice and people say that Twice is basically copying Girls Generation But I\u2019m not sure\u2026.Who knows?

There are more solo stans than blinks and hate on the members they don't stan. I am not a fan of k-pop at all but I must say stop calling Army's toxic cause they are really sweet and supportive towards one another. On the other hand some blinks create hate accounts for BTS to bring them down. I have seen so many hate accounts on instagram that only have posts that show hate towards BTS. Not comparing , just stating facts. Blackpink deserves better fans. All Army's aren't toxic so stop saying so cause tbh most of them are super nice ",

I don't know why people are so sure that this base has the most toxic people. They are also fans of other kpop groups and artists. If you wanna prove that this group has the most toxic fans, you have to interview or experiment atleast a 90 million people individually, and these people are fans of only one group. Sure they may be toxic people in this base, but soon, they will open their eyes. I'm not only talking about armies, I'm talking about all those people in the world who are called toxic I suppose. Those eyes will be opened by that special someone, who is capable enough to do it. ",

Y'all are getting obsessed on bts and army's. BP doesn't deserve a fandom like this, please just stop and just focus on your faves.  ",
