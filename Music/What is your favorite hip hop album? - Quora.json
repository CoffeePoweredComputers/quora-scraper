            "answer_text": "It is very difficult to pick just one Favorite hiphop album. Especially if you listen to the genre pretty well. its like picking a favorite movie, pretty much close to impossible to me. I have top selections though. Harder when it comes to music. I\u2019ll give you 20 that I maybe could sleep at night with. They are not ranked. 1- Jay-Z - Life And Times of S. Carter Vol 3: This is the reason I became a Jay-Z fan. Thats just why its special to me. I consider some of his other albums better though, but this has a special place in my heart. Genius. 2- KA - Grief Pedigree: This guy has redefined internal rhymes and metaphors in a rap 16. His lyricism is damn near impeccable it gives me shudders when I realize this guy has no higher education under his belt. I\u2019m on my third college degree, I could never write like this. Plus the imagery\u2026 Look at the below water themed metaphors:\u201cDOVE IN vicious, road to riches, our LANE is open/ DOWSERS try, no CLOUD in the sky, but our REIGN\u2019S approaching / The style\u2019s WILD CURRENT, can\u2019t tame the OCEAN/ Then he ends the verse: \u201cSEASONED vet, you should accept the SAGE has spoken\u201d. Brilliance. 3 - Scarface - The Fix. : Scarface makes story telling seem easier than ABC. It\u2019s not. 4- Tupac - Makaveli (Don Killuminati) - His best album IMO. Four words - Me and My girlfriend. 5- Nas - Stillmatic : Almost flawless. 6 -Chino XL - The RICANstruction: This is basically Chino XL\u2019s magnum opus and the reason I consider him one of the best emcees. He did a song which was a lesson in oxymoron: Silent Art Child. Go listen to it, come back and write your appreciation essay then. 7 -Big Pun - Capital Punishment: Great album8- Talib Kweli - The Beautiful Struggle : I became a Talib fan because of this album. Just packed with impressive poetry and heartfelt messages. 9 -Common -Be: Combination of Kanye\u2019s production genius and Common\u2019s beautiful and sincere poetry. 10- Jay-Z - American Gangster : Pretty much a more mature and grown up version of Reasonable Doubt. Incredible. 11-Killah Priest : The Psychic World Of Walter Reed : Essentially a journey into the wondrous metaphysical and philosophical mind of Killah Priest. Incredible melding of beats, ambience and lyrics. Now this is strictly headphone music. You can\u2019t really just play this in the car, it needs one of those lying in the bed, eyes closed focused listening sessions. Filled with stream of consciousness /internal monologue (whichever floats your boat) kind of writing. Love it, love it, love it. 12- Vakill - Armor Of God : Bar none, one of the best punchliners in hiphop. 13- Cunninglynguists- A Piece Of Strange : One of the most underrated groups in hiphop. Incredible instrumentals and lyrics. 14- Cunninglynguists: Oneirology. I have no words. 15 -Eminem - Marshall Mathers LP : You should know. 16- Biggie - Life After Death 17 - Canibus - Rip The Jacker - One of the greatest wordsmiths of our time. Intelligent lyrics packaged in Stoupe\u2019s awesomeness. 18 -Masta Ace - Disposable Arts - Hiphop would not be the same if this guy didn\u2019t exist. 19 - Lupe Fiasco - Tetsuo & Youth. 20- Rhyme Asylum - Solitary Confinement : Unbelievably amazing wordplay disguised as battle rap packaged in album form. I can do this all day, but i\u2019ll stop here. ",

            "answer_text": "There are so many. I can't pick one. Instead, I'm going to pick 10 albums that are all my favorites: 1. Nas - Illmatic (1994): No explanation needed. This is probably my favorite of all time, but there are so many others it wouldn't be fair to leave it as the only choice.  2. The Wu-Tang Clan - Enter the Wu-Tang (1993): This is a hardcore classic. Easily up there with Illmatic simply for the incredible rhymes and beats. No words describe the 36 Chambers. Just listen.   3. The Notorious B.I.G. - Ready to Die (1994): Man, 1994 was a great year for rap music. This is hip hop's variety show, made by one of the greatest. So many classics. It's the holy trinity of the east coast along with the previous 2.   4. GZA - Liquid Swords (1995): Yet another East Coast classic. GZA masterfully weaves together some of the most complex songs of the 90s and easily serves as the Wu-Tang's best solo album next to Only Built 4 Cuban Linx (Not a favorite but still among the best).   5. 2Pac - Me Against the World (1995): All Eyez on Me is 2Pac's most popular album, but this is my favorite. This is to add a little variety to the list. Definitely one of my favorite west coast classics.   6. Nas - It Was Written (1996): Nas is my favorite rapper of all time, and this should be pretty clear now. Nas's sophomore classic isn't quite Illmatic, but still better than what most rappers could reach for.   7. Jay-Z - Reasonable Doubt (1996): Jay-Z's freshman album is his best. Absolutely stunning and without a doubt his best. How this is his least popular album, I don't know.   8. Run-DMC - Raising Hell (1984): One of hip hop's very first albums. It solidified hip hop as the true storytelling genre and is a fun ride for anyone who's ready to get into hip hop.  9. Eminem - The Marshall Mathers LP (2000): I've said this many times. Eminem is the most overrated rapper of all time. But few rappers ever made an album like the MMLP. Eminem here was at his very best: lyrically, flow-wise, and had just enough controversy to solidify his status as the greatest white rapper to ever live.   10. Kendrick Lamar - good kid m.A.A.d. city (2012): Rap is not dead. This album proves it. An absolute favorite of mine. I can't believe how much complexity there is behind it.   Note: Runner-ups include Only Built 4 Cuban Linx, Ironman, Supreme Clientele, Life After Death, I Am..., The Eminem Show, The Low End Theory, and The Infamous. Other classics are very influential and popular but I never really thought of them as a \"favorite.\" Instead, I call them \"influential classics,\" albums that are great but I don't necessarily love them. These include Paid in Full, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, Straight Outta Compton, All Eyez on Me, and Midnight Marauders. I have listened to all of these albums and I enjoyed all of them.  ",
