BTS and theirs songs are so inspiring that it's very impossible not to wake with music in your head. Not only BTS, but Daya's songs are best for Teenage girls. I am a soon-to-be adult teenager (17) and I assume \u201cSit still, Look pretty\" by her is a song every girl should listen. See you later by Blackpink (k-pop) is a sassy song for women. Music helps to calm you down. When you wake up, you get away from a sweet world, or a horrendous nightmare. But when, all of a sudden, a music of your choice starts playing in your mind, you feel at peace. Am I right? So, guys, waking up with music is normal for people. And that's also a gold feeling. I hope this article works for you. -Son Hwa-min. ",

So, one morning I woke up listening a song in my head. That was english song and it was clear as my own language. I mean english is not my language but hell, the lyrics and tunes were sooo clear. I thought how did I memorized this song and singing it so perfectly. I was really proud actually of my sudden skill. But when I openend my eyes and got my head up from pillow, the song was slowly vanishing it. Then I looked under my pillow the saw that I forgot to pause music player, earphone was under my pillow and as result, that happened. Other times, the same thing happened actually\u2026 ",

It just all depends on what kind of dream you have and how well you sleep, and whay songs you listen to right before you go directly to sleep, it also depends on what kind of mood you're in as well before you go to sleep for the night or even take a cat nap even. I hope my answer was helpful to you. ",

Usually when you have a song stuck in your head it can lasts for hours up to a day, but it was playing so much in my head that it literally started to play in my head for days (and nights). It started to stress me out and panic. It would play in my dreams at night, Id wake up from the dream, and it replayed in my head over and over again. I was exhausted\u2026it was a nightmare. I guess you could call it OCD\u2026but it never really happened again\u2026it was a weird trigger I guess. ",

I belong to two choirs and often, after a rehearsal, I will wake in the middle of the night with one of the pieces going round and round in my head, a real ear worm. Sometimes the piece is difficult to sing, especially without accompaniment, which makes it doubly annoying. After a concert, this usually happens once or twice and then I\u2019m fine again - till next time. I\u2019m told the best way to lose an ear worm is to sing Happy Birthday to yourself though I confess I\u2019ve never really tried it out! ",
