            "answer_text": "Rapping fast is a skill that takes time and practice so here are some start up techniques to get used to. Your breathing. You need to be able to say a lot of words in one breath as youre trying to articulate and spread a message, while sounding good at the same time. So take deep breaths and allow your lungs to create muscle memory so that your breathing is always deeper and longer, for good sound, and for quantity of words.If you have no words to practice rapping over and over again extremely fast, use gibberish that can help your articulation and say them very fast over and over. Example: Ba-du-ba-di and Fo-do-fo-fum. Continue to repeat those in sequence as fast as you can until you can articulate them all swiftly and smoothly. Incorporate your own words and feel free to think of other gibberish type words that you feel would help. The point is, practice rapping as fast as you can as often as you can, it works trust me.A final tip I advise to you, that helped me a ton, was just listening to a lot of fast rap artists that have great vocals and articulation. (If you haven't noticed, articulating what you're saying is most important. No one cares how fast you rap if no one can understand you) Listen to artists like; Eminem, hes the OG and raps faster than almost any rapper. His style of music is a little absurd and aggressive for the common public so a more modest alternative would be\u2026 Logic, hes a young, amazing vocalist, and raps insanely fast. His message is mainly peace, love, and positivity and he raps about his story which is moving. If you're a fan of funny rap, Lil Dicky, who featured on XXL freshman in 2016 consistently has fast raps and he\u2019ll have you crying of laughter. All these artists could help because if you listen closely, their breathing is very important to their sound. Any questions let me know. Wishing you the best and good luck rapping!",

            "answer_text": "Ah. Good question. First start with a simple tongue twister. Like \u201cShe sells seashells by the seashore\u201d and repeat that over an over again. Each time you repeat it, increase your speed. Once you have mastered that tongue twister and you have reached the speed you consider really fast, find another one and do that one, same process. Do about 3\u20135 different tongue twisters. Now, move on to a whole rap verse by a fast rapper. Try Tech N9ne. Choose one of their fast verses, but not one of their fastest. If you chose Tech N9ne, try his verse from Fragile, or Worldwide Choppers. Repeat that verse until you have it perfect. Now move on to faster songs. Like his verse from Midwest Choppers. Or, Welcome To The Midwest. Keep doing it until you\u2019ve mastered them all. When rapping, trying moving your hands a lot. It makes the speed a bit more natural. Hold your hand out in front of you, and move your fingers at the same speed that you are rapping. Fling your hand aggressively at the end of a bar, or an emphasized syllable. It helps a lot to keep your speed in check. I remember well when I first started practicing fast rap. Or Chopping as a lot like to call it. These tips are what allowed me to get to supersonic speed. hope this helps ",
