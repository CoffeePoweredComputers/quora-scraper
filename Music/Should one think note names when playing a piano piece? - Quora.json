            "answer_text": "I think you partly answered your own question - it makes you slower.  The objective of learning to play music is to train your subconscious mind to do as much of the work as possible, so the mechanics become instinctive and you can concentrate your conscious mind on things like phrasing, expression and communicating the emotion of the piece with your audience.   It's like when you learn to read. At first you spell out the letters before working out the word and saying it. Eventually, through repetition, you train your brain to recognise the letter patterns until you don't even consciously think about individual words, but follow the patterns of phrases and sentences. Another example: You're only competent with a language when you stop consciously translating each word into your mother tongue, but can just visualise the meaning directly from the phrases of the new language.  Keep practicing and repeating, and try to get into the flow of the music, rather than focussing your attention on each individual note. ",

            "answer_text": "I learned to read music not long after learning to read words in the English language. I cannot imagine thinking about each note as I play it - it will become impossible once you\u2019ve progressed to more difficult pieces with chords or have to rip off 8th note arpeggios. It\u2019s a bad habit that you should try to break immediately. It\u2019s possible that this habit of yours is a symptom of OCD; only you know if you have other OCD symptoms. Maybe a therapist could suggest a way to banish it from your mind. If it continues, you might want to try medication. ",
