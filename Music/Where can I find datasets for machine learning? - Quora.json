            "answer_text": "You can look into online sources where you can find publicly available datasets (Kaggle, for example). A lot of research groups also share labeled datasets with the community to further machine learning research. However, every dataset is unique in terms of its content. The trouble with public datasets is finding ones that are useful or suitable for your model. If you have the resources, or custom requirements for your data, outsourcing dataset creation or annotation to a crowdsourcing website is probably your best bet. That way, you can get large volumes custom training data quickly and at scale. At my company, Lionbridge AI, our mission is to make it easy to generate labeled data for machine learning algorithms. We cover a wide range of use cases including translation, data categorization, sentiment analysis, content moderation and more. Lionbridge manages the whole process from start to finish, from designing the workflow to sourcing the right workers. ",
