            "answer_text": "Accurately drawing a 3D object on a 2D piece of paper requires understanding (maybe just intuitively) some ideas from projective geometry. This is even more true if you want to properly capture perspective in your drawings. Imagine you want to draw an object casting a shadow: you need to consider where the light source is, the location of the object relative to the light source, and how these factors would affect the scene. Then you need to consider the perspective from which this scene is being viewed: where is the perspective source located (or the camera), how far away from the various objects is it, how wide is this camera\u2019s view? All these questions can be considered mathematically. And if you\u2019re actually doing this on a computer, that is realistically rendering 3D scenes or images, you actually need to use the hardcore math, especially linear algebra and projective geometry.

            "answer_text": "Math is the essential part of art. Many ancient artists like Leonardo Davincci were mathematicians. That's because art without math was just hard to work with. Now onto the question. How is math used in art? Well there are things like Perspective, which uses Golden Phi ratio. Then there is symmetry and asymmetry. And much more. What about music? You can figure out that one by yourself. ",
