I cought \u201cthe time is rite, my heart is set, invite me\u2026) The word Time could possibly be Tide, but google just goes back to the Blondie song \u201cThe Tide Is High\u201d, and not much beyond that. The closest I got is Sassa\u2019s 1988 \u201cWhen The Time is Rite\u201d   It\u2019s close, but sadly, I don\u2019t think it is the same tune though. It does seem to be from the same era, late 80s-early 90s, AND the same style freestyle/club, and even has the same feel as what was big in Miami during the time. Think Miami Vice! Hope this helps. ",
