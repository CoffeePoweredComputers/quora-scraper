            "answer_text": "Learn chords, so that you can play songs that you love, and potentially learning to sing at the same time will help. Eventually you will start to learn more complicated chords involving 7ths and higher extensions, the songs you are learning will become more difficult and you will want to play melodies with your right hand. I would say buy a real book, learn the chords and go from there. Jazz is probably the most fun you\u2019ll have on a piano. ",
