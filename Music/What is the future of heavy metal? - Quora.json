            "answer_text": "The greatest thing about metal music is that it's an ever changing genre of music and the last bastion of the music industry which allows artists to express their feelings in a manner in which they are comfortable with. Some write direct attacking lyrics while some write a story which is actually meant to question the wrongs happening in this world indirectly. There have been bands, there are bands and there will be bands which will always do something unique and keep evolving metal music (some for the better while some for the worse). There are bands today like Meshuggah, Vektor, Ghost, Gojira, Mastodon and a whole lot others which have taken up the helm of metal music and are constantly bringing new material which baffles our minds (listening to Meshuggah can actually make you understand the space and the black holes ) while Gods like Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Kreator, Diamond Head, Venom and a lot of older bands remind us of the classy but angst filled and hard core origins of Heavy Metal music. Our (Metalheads\u2019) way of understanding life and just each and every thing is quite different from the general populace and that's why many a times we are out casted or labelled. But what they don't understand is that our minds as metalheads are constantly driven towards our beloved metal community. We constantly think about doing something for metal and that's why our subculture is something to be proud of and attracts people who are in with metal for life. These are probably the reasons why we do not need to worry about metal because it will always have people who will come up with something great and exciting. Today there is extreme and black metal. Tomorrow there will be math metal and maybe later there will be space metal. But metal\u2019s evolution is inevitable because there will always be bands which are inspired by the Gods and those bands will add something extra to that and create something majestic and awe-inspiring and that is exactly how metal has always been. We had Sabbath in the 70s, Maiden in the 80s, Pantera in the 90s and a massive amounts of great bands since the 2000s. I cannot really give you an example of how it will change because one may never know what kind of an inspiration a person is drawing and what is going through their head but as a Metalhead myself, I'm proud to be a part of a brotherhood which is unique and I am very positive that it's gonna be heading towards the better always. Thanks. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know how to answer this. I think it\u2019s better to look at how the music evolved over time. In the beginning, there was just heavy metal which was a slightly more aggressive sound compared to the status quo back then. Initially it was just anger and aggression being expressed through music but I think the music has evolved over time. With studies showing that metal heads are more loyal to partners, the general population who listens to metal has moved on from angry teenagers to mature people who appreciate the music for what it is. Now, if we apply the same evolutionary pattern to the music, I think metal music is in very safe hands. New bands come up everywhere and many are good. India is becoming the new hotpot of metal music with a very fast growing metal scene. The typical 80\u2019s thrash is slowly blending with death metal and groove metal. Prog metal is bringing jazz back into metal blending blues with it. Metal is becoming the new template of exploring options with a big chance of gaining loyal fans. Take a look at Toska, being led by the Great Rabea Massad who also plays with Dorje. Toska is Dorje without Rob Chapman but the sound is very different. So, this goes back to that evolutionary theory; that metal will keep evolving and just keep getting better. ",
