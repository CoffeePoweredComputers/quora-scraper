So I then brought an AirPods, wonderful music and comfort, fits what I need. But soon lose a side of it. Coz of budgeting, I went on Amz and look for the ones under 50 bucks. (Wireless earbuds are easy to be forgotten somewhere.)  This is what I found. I am not sure about all bunch of things they say in the description. I simply choose it coz it looks cool and idk how to pronounce the brand's name. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 The performance though is just the same as what I 've got as Airpods, at least that is what I feel with my own ears. And the battery stays longer. (I didn't buy other brands and don't know how they perform.) p.s. I haven't loose this one yet, might because it's leather feeling like case. p.s. Can anyone tell me how to correctly pronounce the brand name, please? It is Enacfire. ",

            "answer_text": "I bought and really love the TaoTronics TT-BH076. I\u2019ve two sets so I can switch them out when charging (I travel constantly and use electronic headphones a lot more than average). Super comfy ear pieces that stay in well (not just the little cap that goes in the ear canal but also a crescent that fills the first curve of the inside of your ear, which helps both hold it in place and muffle outside sounds more). Really good sound. Charge lasts for several hours. The marketing says 30 hours a charge (not in the box charging, but actual use time), but I\u2019ve never tested that out specifically. I just know that in the year I\u2019ve had them I\u2019ve only ran out of charge (after hours and hours and hours) a couple of times. If I recall right they were around $25\u201330 back when I bought them on Amazon last year. ",
