            "answer_text": "Okay so magnets are what basically make guitar amplification possible. When you make an electric guitar pickup, the idea is to arrange magnets together in such a way that they are close enough to the nickel wound guitar strings so that when the strings vibrate the magnets \"pick up\" the sound waves and create an electric signal that is sent through more wires and a cable extending out from the input of the body of the guitar and into the amplifier. There are two ways of picking up the string vibrations: through either passive or active pickups. Basically, passive pickups do not require the use of a battery to create an amplified sound whereas active pickups do. There are also two types of both passive and active pickups: single-coil or humbucker. Basically, a humbucker is two single coils wired together to reduce or otherwise cancel \"hum\". Passive pickups and active pickups have different tone. Active pickup tone is generally characterized as being more consistent in quality as it is a more \"customizable\" sound through the avenue of an equalizer which gives you the ability to adjust the actual sound frequency of the string vibrations and, thus, its musical pitch -- highs, mids, lows. Metal players use a lot of active pickups. Then again, it can also be used to create a powerful, full-on, fat, bluesy-psychedelic sound; David Gilmour used active EMGs in a guitar which can be heard on the \"Pulse\" recording. Guitar tone is mostly personal preference. One develops his electric guitar tone palette through experimentation with different equipment, equipment settings, and even in how one plays the instrument. ",
