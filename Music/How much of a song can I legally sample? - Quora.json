            "answer_text": "While there is little doubt about the creative and inspirational value of sampling in modern music production, the short and safe answer here is, \u201cnone.\u201d Anything you sample from another artist\u2019s recording, and is recognizable/recognized by any party, puts you at risk for lawsuit. I recommend going the legal route and either licensing the sample properly, or replaying/hiring someone to recreate what you love about the recording, keeping in mind that you still may be subject to copyright terms. Here\u2019s a great article[1] on the subject by Sean McCauley of Octane. My recommendation from experience on both sides is to stay legal and avoid problems down the road. What if you create something now that suddenly and unexpectedly becomes popular 5 years from now, tangling you in legal issues at a time when your song (and your career, touring, studio work, etc.) needs your attention most?

Back in the 90s I released a track called the masterplan, earlier this year I was working on a new track called we have a plan, it was suggested that the voice clips from masterplan (my own voice) could fit in the new track, unfortunately I didn't have a mic to re record them so I had to sample the original voice clip but before I could release it I had to get permission from my old label to use my own voice because they held the copyright to the original audio ",
