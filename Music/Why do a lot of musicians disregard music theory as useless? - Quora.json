            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure how true a representation that is, there might be lots of musicians who have little music theory understanding, but its another thing to say they would regard it as useless. Most I would say, perhaps don\u2019t have the aptitude for it and have made a reputation for themselves without the need to learn. Like anything, there are different ways to crack a nut, taking a non-academic approach to yield, interesting results is a legitimate practice, but it would be kind of dumb to say its the only way to come up with anything pioneering. In time, any successful musician - trained or not, will likely end up knowing some theory, either through identifying patterns, spending alot of time in recording studios with sesssion musicans or producers who will hand off interesting tricks, or bits of musical knowledge. If you are a serious musician, it will simply make your job easier to learn some fundamentals. Like any businessman (the music industry is a business) you will eventually recognise the need to save time and so instead of fumbling your way through writing sessions or recording sessions, searching for terminology and looking a total fool - you\u2019ll naturally pick up some useful ways to describe an idea. The thing is, even the most committed punk bands - if they are playing 100s of live dates a year, recording a ton and mixing with other musicians - they end up becoming pretty knowledgable whether they like it or not!

            "answer_text": "What is music theory? There is nothing particularly theoretical about it. For most of us in the West it is a style study. At the risk of oversimplifying, music theory is an attempt to extract from a body of work a number of observable and repeated practices. Most of these practices can be found in Bach\u2019s Chorales. Some of these practices have survived to this day \u2014- at least in some contexts. Many of us, including non-musicians, have the cultural awareness to recognize the implications of particular practices. For example, in music theory we would say that the leading tone has a tendency to resolve to tonic. You can play an ascending C-major scale for a non-musician and stop on B, and ask them to sing the next note. Most would undoubtedly sing C. If you asked a non-musician how they felt if you ended a piece on a dominant chord, many would no doubt say they felt uneasy or uncomfortable or incomplete. At the same time, music is not exclusively a Western phenomenon governed by practices we can trace to Bach. Nor has it frozen in time even in the West. Music Theory as it has typically been taught in the West ignores a great many practices of non-Western cultures and typically only scratches the surface of contemporary music practices in the West \u2014- and even when it does, it is often inadequate. Without going too far down this rabbit hole (as tempted as I am), I will leave it at this? Does an author need to have a theoretical understanding of language to write an essay or a book? Most of us probably don\u2019t have a great grasp of the grammar we studied in grade school. And yet, we can write sentences and paragraphs and make up little stories. Some of us are better at it than others. Some of us spend much more time at it and improve as we practice the craft. However, our acquisition of language skills through cultural exposure (and practice) is probably far more important than understanding the theory. So likewise, the acquisition of music skills through cultural exposure and practice may serve us better in our craft (be that composing or performing \u2014- or simply listening) than a formal study of music theory. Having said all that, I would argue there is still a place for music theory in the well-rounded education of a complete musician. If nothing else, music theory presents us with a \u201cway\u201d of understanding music. It provides an intellectual roadmap, even if the tools we are given are not absolutely up to the task, to delve deeper into the questions of what makes this particular music work? ",
