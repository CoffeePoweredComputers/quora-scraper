            "answer_text": "The Strawberry Alarm Clock, now there is a name from days past.  The band formed back in 1966 and saw their first shot at wide recognition with the hit song \"Incense and Peppermints\" that same year. The song shot to the top of the BillBoard Top 100 but only for one week. It put the band into the public eye. The group with their new found recognition began to tour with names such as Buffalo Springfield as well as a group called The Beach Boys ;-\\ . The band was on the way, or were they? Lineup changes began early on within the band effectively changing the formula for success they initially may have had. By the early 1970\u2019s the buzz surrounding the band had began to subside and following internal bickering the group disbanded in 1971 with the various members scattering into other projects. Lead guitarist Ed King joined a group called Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1972. You may have heard of the group ;-) . King was the creator of the opening guitar riff for Sweet Home Alabama. The band reunited briefly in 1974 performing a few shows before quietly vanishing into the mists of time once again. But they again reunited in 1982 being tricked by a newspaper ad that had billed them as playing at a club in Los Angeles. That turned out to be an attempt by the club owner to get the band to reunite and he was successful. The band then soldiered on doing the oldies tour circuit disbanding once again in around 1982. In 2001 the band appeared in a San Diego concert and in the following years the band or whatever variant of a lineup they had/have continued to be involved in various musical ventures, but The Strawberry Alarm Clock we knew and loved long ago are effectively long gone. All that remains are the songs and the memories.  ",
