            "answer_text": "I\u2019m no pro, and I\u2019ve owned around 5 kits over the last 20\u201330 years. I started playing in college and am self-taught. I guess what I play would fall into the \u201crock\u201d category, so here\u2019s my take\u2026 The things that have been most important to me are the heads and the tuning. I\u2019ve used a \u201cdrum dial\u201d in the past before I tuned more by ear and it helped get the sound pretty consistent across all the drums. I\u2019ve played sets that are wrapped in plastic (cheaper) and now have a solid maple ddrum kit that I like. My take would be to worry less about the actual drum shells and focus on these items\u2026 Make sure the hardware is good and won\u2019t strip out if you\u2019re setting up and breaking down a lot (playing out)Get good cymbals for the style you\u2019re playing (Ziljian A\u2019s or Sabian AA\u2019s for example)Get good heads, change them as needed and work on getting top and bottom heads to resonate for the sound you want or the room you play inI guess that\u2019s it.

            "answer_text": "Some of the most common brands of drums played by popular rock players are Tama and Ludwig. Almost every major drum manufacturer makes drum sets that could be \u201crock\u201d setups. I play Yamaha drums, and I love them for rock, pop, funk, and just about anything else. It\u2019s more about the sizes of drums, the shell materials, and the head choices than the brand. A common \u201crock\u201d setup would be: 22\u2033 bass drum, 5.5 x 14\u2033 snare drum, and at least a 12\u2033 rack tom and 16\u2033 floor tom. If you like more toms, you can add in a 10\u2033 rack tom and a 14\u2033 floor tom as well. Maple and birch are some of the most common shell materials for rock drums. The Tama Superstar Classic (maple) and the Yamaha Stage Custom (birch drums) are 2 great options to get you started. Both are under $1,000 and are quality instruments that you\u2019ll own for a lifetime if you take care of them. ",
