            "answer_text": "Let me give you my answer.. Trance music for me is about the sound, the culture\u2026 everything Trance gets you into a hypnotic state if you let it, getting completely introspective and what not, it\u2019s really a meditation\u2026 the way you dance on trace is completely automatic and if done right, you\u2019ll just be smiling and dancing like a maniac! You just need to let yourself get into the music and find your type of trance\u2026 my favorite would be Goa trance but I like any\u2026 Trance is just not a big pile of sounds playing together (I\u2019m not saying any music is, but I\u2019ve been told that) trance music is carefully composed to get you to another level\u2026 Trance is a passion, it\u2019s really good\u2026. Seriously, find the trance you like and let yourself get into it.. just close your eyes, make sure there\u2019s no people around you so you can be 100% into the music and just let go\u2026 let your body and mind feel the music, get into it, fall in trance! and you\u2019ll see\u2026 beyond this aspect it\u2019s really good too because it\u2019s fun to dance to and listen to Trance artists typically try to show what they\u2019re feeling with their music, the same way some other singers do\u2026 Any thing about it ask me :), or the culture too whatever man And as others have said and I tried to explain, trance is not just a music but a story, a mindset\u2026 on the drug question, you do not need drugs to listen to it (you don\u2019t need drugs for anything but what I mean is this will take you wherever you let it to take you) ",

            "answer_text": "I know this question is older, but I wanted to answer it anyway. For me, it\u2019s mostly because of the incredibly happy and encouraged way it makes me feel. Uplifting and Progressive Trance are my favorites and whenever I\u2019m sad those are the two sub-genres of trance I listen to. They have an uncanny ability to remind you of the good things in life. Trance is such a beautiful and gentle reminder of how wonderful this life can be and all of the blessings we have. Trance reminds me I\u2019m glad to be who I am and what I am and it reminds me of love and hope and joy. I believe this is why a lot of Christian artists (like Plumb and Adam Young) provide vocals and lyrics for a lot of Uplifting trance songs. And it\u2019s also why I believe a lot of artists who do Trance vocals/songwriting exclusively (like HALIENE and Eric Lumiere) are Christians (because of the content of their lyrics). It\u2019s also partly because of nostalgia for me. I discovered Trance and House music in middle school back in 2007/2008 and listened to both genres all through high school up until this very day and listening to it just holds a lot of memories for me. I think for a lot of us, we have these reasons in common, actually. ",
