She seems to have a nice, broad and honest smile, that goes a long way towards attractiveness for me. I wouldn\u2019t call her unattractive, but I wouldn\u2019d say attractive either. I generally tune down my attractiveness score by the amount of makeup used / It looks great on many people, but I can only rate the work of Art then, not the person wearing it :) ",
