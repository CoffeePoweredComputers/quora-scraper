            "answer_text": "Any chord that contains a tritone interval in it somewhere is going to provide the necessary tension and will want to move towards resolution (even a simple V7 I, where there's a tritone between the third and minor seven of the V7). Whether or not the chord you choose wants to resolve to your root, or to something else, is a circle of fifths and voice leading issue. ",

            "answer_text": "A nice turnaround I like using is a Valt7 chord which works very well if the preceeding chord is a half-diminished.  For example in Dm: E half-dim - A7alt - Dm.  They work because both the half dim and the alt chord belong to a melodic minor harmony, creating a bit of tension before the minor I chord resolution.That and they sound hip to me. ",
