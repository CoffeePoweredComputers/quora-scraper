            "answer_text": "Lots of options here. Mesh drum heads and plastic cymbals. I think this is the best option, assuming that the child also has a \u201creal\u201d drumset somewhere for developing tone and technique and the home \u201csilent\u201d kit is just for practicing those skills. If they have a school set or a set at a private lesson studio to play on, this can be ideal.Drum silencing pads and cymbal \u201csilencing\u201d pads. These work okay, but I\u2019m not a fan of how they react. The rubber drum pads feel like rubber, not like drum heads, so technique suffers. The cymbal pads do a lot to quiet the cymbals, but they\u2019re not silent. The nice thing about this solution, however, is that you can just remove them to get a full volume, touch sensitive drum set.Electric drum set. This is EASILY the most expensive option. They do make cheap drum sets, but these are terrible for a young player to work on unless there\u2019s literally no other option. PLEASE don\u2019t spend $300 on an electric kit thinking it will be a perfect solution. The drums are not durable, so they will break quickly. They don\u2019t have a lot of dynamic range, so the student will not learn to play quietly or with control (which is easily one of the most important aspects a professional player can have). They don\u2019t sound good and they don\u2019t play well.You can do this, but be prepared to spend 2\u20133 thousand dollars on a high quality electronic kit that does a better job of approximating the nuance of a real drum set and will last more than a few weeks.Soundproofing. This may seem daunting, but there are some fairly simple things you can do. If the drum set is upstairs, it needs to be \u201cdecoupled\u201d from the floor. I\u2019ve seen this done by building two 6x6 ft or 8x8 ft platforms, each with a small lip. Turn one upside down (lip facing up) and tightly fill the space with tennis balls (alternately, carve out indentations for the tennis balls to sit - the idea is that you don\u2019t want the upper platform to roll; just not transfer vibration to the floor). Now put the second platform lip down on top of the tennis balls - ensure the lips don\u2019t touch - and put the drum set atop the platform. Now the vibrations won\u2019t transfer to the floor as much. Obviously, you\u2019ll also want to make sure the doors are tightly sealed (solid core doors are better than hollow).Location, location, location. I\u2019ll never forget the day in eighth grade when my dad came in and said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a present for you!\u201d He walked me out to the barn in the back yard, climbed the ladder to the loft, and there I found my drum set, guitar amp, loud stereo, a light, a TV, and a space heater (it was November). \u201cHere you go, son,\u201d he said, \u201cyour very own studio.\u201d I was really excited, but then my eyes narrowed\u2026 \u201cWait a minute,\u201d I said. \u201cThis is just to move the drums out of the house, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cHave fun!\u201d my dad called, grinning ear to ear.",

            "answer_text": "practice pads 24/7, than \u201cthe set\u201d during negotiated hrs. If the kid is havin trouble w/something - marks, behavior, whatever\u2026set up an earning system that is \u201cin addition to\u201d. In other wrds be a real dad, bite the bullet & suffer the kit itself if he can stop pickin on a younger sib, move a mark from a C to a B, etc. Make it a real program for real benifits (have increments in there earned for increments. We want him to live\u2019n die frm his own behavior) Ex: currently Cs, a C+ in xxx amount of time will earn 10 min of play 1X a day for the nxt 3 wks. a B- will earn 15 min of play, etc etc Measure wkly if possible, reward immediatly as this strengthens the power of the program. He can not get play (on the set) out side of the other negotited time (& this is a bit of a disencentive for the mark imprvement). Also it can not B taken away for things not marks related. Comprende`? Our job is to help them mature\u2019m grow toward independence. My house - no 1 gets any object or freedom w/o earning it. Also, nothing earned is taken away. I distribute no punishments as life has plenty of them. Like a single step on a stair I acknowledge, attend to (grant incentives) notice, each incremental advancement toward growth\u2019n maturity. Rather than give a cellie (1 example) just for being a resident of this house (teaches \u201cAll I gotta do is lay around here & things drop into my lap.\u201d) or cuz a friend has it, they prove to me there is the ability to successfully use a cellie. Cont the example: it may B they have shown me thru successive steps w/a land line they 1) have proper etiquette, 2) call at the correct time of day, 3) no bulling, 4) appropriate time limits, etc \u2013 anything I wish to have child demonstrate. Successful? Onto the nxt step. Measure for awhile, success? Up a step. Not successful? (went on the net, I had said that is \u201cway up the stairs\u201d, \u201cnot wrkin on that yet\u201d) go back one (or several steps) till I believe they R ready to try it again but w/success. They \u2018live\u2019n die\u2019 on the results of their own behavior. Not a punisher but an assister, guide, rewarder, ed/trainer. The incentives (rewards) relate directly to the tasks as do the disincentives. If I miss a day at wrk does the boss throw \u2018the boot\u2019 on my car wheel? No, he docks my pay. (The \u201closs\u201d equals the \u201cpunishment\u201d). Mis-takes R just that, required prerequisites to learning. It means \u201ctake over again\u201d (when ready for success). I want my child 2 learn, B successful, safe. If they can\u2019t reach hi enuff, I break dwn the task into sm enuff prt so they can achieve it. (I\u2019ve been on the planet longer than them, have more experience, so can C these connections they may not). This is just an overview. For detail C my answ to other Qs here on Quora (\u201cA Different Way of Parenting\u201d; \u201cDeepening Family Dialogue\u201d). ",
