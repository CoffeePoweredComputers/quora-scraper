            "answer_text": "Before Oppo decided to get out of the spinning sliver disc market, they were a very good value for people who valued good analog reproduction above anything else. Now? The last time I looked at a used Oppo 4K player on eBay is was $2300, this for a box which sold new for less than $400. Most of the disc players today which are of reasonable cost play multiple disc formats and output the audio via an HDMI digital connection. In this respect they only act as transports. The reason that the Oppo is so valued is that it had a high quality DAC for the analog audio output so you could use that if your receiver, integrated amp, or preamp does not have a good DAC stage. NOTE: most AVR\u2019s will convert analog inputs into digital for processing and then convert them back to analog for final output. Don\u2019t worry about it. So, there are lots of decent 4K UHD spinning silver disc players which will do the job, start by looking at this review: The Best 4K Blu-ray Player for 2020 ",

            "answer_text": "You need to decide which features you need. Sony and Onyko make multi-platter players which may be important to you. Both deliver great sound-at a price. The Sony also plays CD R/RW discs and can record and play MP3 WDMA and AAC files from USB. So my vote goes to the Sony CDP-CE500 with the Onyko DXC390 a close second. But combined 4K BluRay and CD players are also popular. Here Sony comes out top again with the UBPX700. It supports Dolby Atmos and most recently Dolby Vision too. The top of range Panasonic 4K Bluray player DMP UB400GAK is also worth a listen but its very expensive. ",
