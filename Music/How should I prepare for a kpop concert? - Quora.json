            "answer_text": "ok i went to the BTS concert in HK and there were some things I wished I had. We had a sitting seat so it was easier for us, however, if you are standing, you probably have to get to your seat pretty early and wait there. Most basic things needed: your phone (and earphones) - What i found from the concert in Hong Kong was that you could not bring in cameras if you were in the sitting seats, however, this depends. My friend brought a camera and had to pay money for it to be kept until the end of the concert. A good phone would do perfectly fine. Earphones are not compulsory but preconcert jams are always the best before a concert if you have a long line ahead of you.your phone / camera charger - my phone was literally on the verge of dying, i had to borrow my friends charger for this, and plus since your phone might be recording the entire concert, this is very important. You could check the concert requirements to see what you can bring too.Water - I dont know about you, but I scream A LOT in concerts, I basically lost my voice, so I suggest you bring more than 1 bottle, the guards will usually let you bring water in so it\u2019s fineyour concert ticket (wallet) - If you do not have your concert ticket uh you are basically screwed, wallet is needed if you need transportation or to pay for any merch you can preorder or buy there.Optional things that you should bring/learn/be prepared for: Fanchants - Since it is Kpop most songs (if not all) will have a fan-chants, it varies for each song so if you really like that group, it would be recommended that you at least learn it.Posters/signs/lightsticks - Lightsticks are the most common in fans because it looks nice when there is a lot and for some, it can change colour, however, it can be very expensive. I did buy one in advance because I was scared that in the concerts they would run out of stock (And they did). Lightsticks are not compulsory, posters, signs of the group or your bias is also great. At times, holding them up can be very tiring if you are standing in the front, especially if you are also holding your phone, however, many fans still do it.Fan-organised projects - When I went to the BTS concert, some of the fans at designed seats had to hold up purple lightsticks when it was a specific song. They also gave out fans and small lights to shine. It depends on where you are but there would most likely be a project, be prepared for this! :)jacket - unless it is summer and a open concert, I really suggest you bring a jacket, although i was wearing jeans and a jacket, I was still freezing in the concert hall.Hope this helps! have fun in your concert! :) ",

            "answer_text": "Get plenty of sleepSo you have enough energy to you know, jump around and dsnce to the songsDrink plenty of waterHoney water would help tooYou will be waiting for the concert to start and even when it does you will probably be screaming the whole time you don't want to lose your voice\u2026 being hydrated will help.Charge your phone and battery packsYou don't want your phone to die with no way to charge it without leaving your seat (this happened to me whoops)You will probably be bored before the concert starts, you could make friends with other people in the fandom that are around you.Make sure though to have enough battery for the concert and enough after to get an uber if you need oneIf you do get an uber prepare to walk especially after concert endsBring extra cashThis is definitely important. Because when you are there you with probably get a lightstick and then you might want some shirts and then maybe a bag\u2026. Etc\u2026Bring a coat if it is less than 45 or so degrees.I was at a concert with no jacket and it was freezing outside. (Even the members of the group said so. One said \u201cdon\u2019t catch a cold\u201d to the audience as well.)CLEAR BAG!!!If you bring a bag, bring a clear one otherwise you will either have to walk and get a lockerYou may even have to just surrender it if you want to get inside the concert asap (my sister gave up her bag when we went)Learn all the songs from the album and any other iconic songs from other albums.So you can sing along to the musicEven learn the dances if you are that dedicated\uff3c\uff08\u3007_\uff4f\uff09\uff0fBring deodorant?If you are jumping around, you might get sweaty so\u2026This didn\u2019t occur to me when i packed my bad for the concert\u2026Make sure you are strong (ish) and have good grip if you are in the pitMany people pass out there and there is a lot of pushing. Try to keep your place by holding on to the rail (?) tightly.By prepared to waitSelf explanatoryDon't be mad if you leave earlyI left early, right before the last song of the concert, and i got to get a shirt, since there was no line, and i got to my hotel pretty quickly compared to others and i didn't have to wait for an uber too long. Some people walked the whole way to the hotels and some waited HOURS for a ride\u2026 this may not be all concerts though, smaller groups (or bands.. I want to go to a day6 concert) may not be like this.Have Fun!!!Nobody cares if you scream all the lyrics. Nobody cares if you dance and jump. Nobody cares if you say Korean really badly. Because chances are, everyone is going to be doing it with you. Don't be afraid to scream out names members of a group or an artist. Just enjoy yourself, have fun! Hope you enjoyed, these are all the things i could think of that you should do to prepare for a kpop concert! Thanks for the request ~  \u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\uc0ac\ub791\ud574\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7 ",
