            "answer_text": "The standard spacing for keyboard keys is 3/4 inch. Even if you see this expressed in metric (19mm), your own measurements will reveal that it\u2019s really 3/4 inch or 19.05mm. Depending on the sculpting of the keytop, you won\u2019t always get 3/4 of an inch in size but, center-to-center, that spacing remains standardized. The overall size of the complete keyboard will depend on layout, fascia design, and where the circuitry is placed. As the circuitry has shrunk in size, the main controller is usually above the number pad where the LEDs are placed, and there are now many designs out there which have no fascia leaving the keys to \u201cfloat\u201d, giving the Extended Model M layout in the smallest footprint. This footprint has been further reduced by the elimination of the number pad (called ten-keyless), and shrinking the Function keys along with moving them closer to the numeric row. Obviously, laptops are already \u201cten-keyless\u201d and have some mis-shapen cursor keys to fit into the confined space. However, the typing keys remain spaced at 3/4 inch, although the number pad is making an obvious return as Laptops are growing in size and often used as replacements for desktop machines. Generally, only netbooks have a smaller spacing to fit everything into a smaller area. That is why people who are keyboard dependent for high productivity don\u2019t like using them. The standard of 4mm travel for a keyboard was introduced after metrification which is why there is no simple Imperial equivalent (0.157 inch). Also note that only manufacturers of decent mechanical keyboards pay any attention to this standard (e.g, Cherry and Filco). I have often wondered why there isn\u2019t a 1/2-inch standard keyboard spacing for children. ",

            "answer_text": "Generally speaking, computer keyboards are available in 3 sizes: 104-key or full-size, 10-keyless, and 60% keyboards.  The full-sized keyboard, typically containing 104 keys is the most common. It has the usual alphabet keys, with numerical keys above the letters, and the function keys above that. To the right, you\u2019ll see the direction keys and general page movement keys, and to the right of that a numeric keypad. 10-keyless is a step down in size. It has all the keys of the the full sized keyboard, except the numeric keypad. The 60% keyboard has your alphabet keys and the numeric line of keys above the alphabet keys and that\u2019s it. You typically see this style keyboard on smaller laptops, but stand-alone 60% keyboards exist as well. From there, you\u2019ll run into other quirky looking keyboards, but their overall key layout is typically a slight deviation from one of the three previously mentioned keyboard layouts.    ",
