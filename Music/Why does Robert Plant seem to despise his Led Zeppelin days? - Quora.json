            "answer_text": "I been reading all of the answers to your question. Wow you got people who actually talked to plant about that. That's cool. I do however want to correct the record on a few things. My source is a very good interview with Mr. Plant by one Dan Rather. When Mr. Rarher said to him, about his past, \u201c I imagine if you looked up Drugs,Sex and Rock and Roll in the dictionary, there would be a picture if Led Zeppelin there.\u201d Roberts reply was, and I quote, Well Thank you very much. That's very kind of you. So let's put to bed the thought that he was ashamed or embarrassed by his past.He seems pretty comfy with his past. In that same interview he spoke of his great appreciation and even love of his old band mates. Present tense. At no time did he say anything derogatory or negative about the \u201cLads \u201c He does say that to him, the time has passed. I will admit after watching Jason fill in for his dad, I had Hope's. But honestly, Led Zeppelin was 4 guys who came together musically, in a way that has never been equaled. To want more out of them is what every musician dreams will be his fate. When Bonzo died Zeppelin was over. Unleaded was a great gift from 2 of the 4, wish Jonsey would have been involved, but what ya going to do. The 02 show was like seeing everything you loved about them then realizing, as good as it was, it couldn't go on. I am first and foremost a Jimmy Page fan. He was the one who formed my all time favorite band. Saying that I have nothing but love and respect for Robert's decision to not tour under the Zeppelin banner but perform the music in a different way. As did Jimmy. See the puff daddy version of Kashmire, I know it wasn't called kashmire but it was kashmire. As said by others listen to the stuff with the Black crows. I think Mr \u2018s Page,Okantand Jones have given us much more than we could have dreamed possible in 1970 when Bonzo died. I also think they will remain tied to each other forever. I also think they are pretty fucking proud of that. ",

            "answer_text": " Robert Plant\u2019s relationship with Led Zeppelin has been very well documented since they broke up. Going as far back as 1982 in fact. Yes\u2026 that early. In 1982 in an interview supporting his first solo album Pictures at Eleven, Plant made this quote regarding a Led Zeppelin reunion: \u201cThere is no functional purpose for keeping things going\u201d In 1985 he said the following: \u201cBeing in Led Zeppelin was like living in a goldfish bowl\u2026 things were done on such a grand scale. The band was such a perpetual-motion machine that didn\u2019t allow me to stop and consider the values of the whole thing. The values were kind of in chaos for a while. The experience was a distortion of reality. My perspective of reality and hard work was out of line\u201d In 1990, he said this which I found very interesting: \u201cI don\u2019t know the guy who sang in Led Zeppelin. I see some very funny pictures of him, then I see Rock\u2019s vile offspring trotting behind in Lurex pants and leather gloves with the fingers cut off\u201d In 2012, \u201cYou have to be creative and imaginative and move on. And I think the great essence of Led Zeppelin is the creation and imagination that developed with each project. And a project is a project, it\u2019s not just going back and revisiting the past, it\u2019s moving forward\u201d And finally in 2017 \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to keep moving forward\u201d  Now that I have laid sort of a preface to set the mood let me explain the reality behind Robert Plant\u2019s comments and maybe even offer a brief glimpse into his mind. For Robert Plant, Led Zeppelin really died in 1977 when his son passed. None of his bandmates attended his son\u2019s funeral, in fact if I remember from an article I read a while back, when Plant lost his son, Page was too high to even realize what was going on. It is my feeling that this event was the beginning of the end for Led Zeppelin. Robert Plant began evaluating his life, he saw that touring had taken away from Karac when he most needed his father, he saw the effects sex, money and drugs were having on his friends John Bonham and Jimmy Page. Robert actually considered quitting Led Zeppelin but Bonham convinced him to keep going. So he did because his best friend asked him to, not for music, not for fame, but for his best friend. When John died, Robert was done. For him, Led Zeppelin is a band which has given him everything and taken everything. He lost his innocence, his friend, his son and years of enjoying life that he will never get back. I don\u2019t think Robert hates Led Zeppelin, but might he regret accepting Jimmy Page\u2019s offer? Honestly\u2026 yes, I do think he does at some points. I doubt it is a controlling thought or else he would never contribute to any Led Zeppelin projects such as Celebration Day, the remasters and the book, but I think it is an itching thought in the back of his mind and one that prevents him from ever accepting any form of Reunion offer. Robert seems happy doing his own thing, he enjoys a life now where he is at peace, making music without cost. ",
