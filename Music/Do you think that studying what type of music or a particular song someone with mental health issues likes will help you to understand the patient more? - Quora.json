            "answer_text": "Yes, assuming music has some meaning in the clients life (for most people it seems to have). The important questions whould concern the meaning of the songs/artists, what they represent to the client and what makes them pleasing. Usually there are patterns there that span to the patients thinking, values and experience of world in general. There are many reasons why someone would be interested in some specific music. Many genres have their own culture with their own values and esthetics. Sometimes the artists or songs associate with meaninful life experiences or people. Sometimes certain emotions expressed in songs or lyrics are especially appealing to the client either because they match the clients emotions or because they are contrary enough to them so that the client can use the music to alter their undesired emotional experiences (you know, like listening to happy music to get rid of sadness). Also for professional musicians and some amateurs the music is such a central part of everything in their life that it would be the best way to understand them. For some it has defined their social networks and even basic functions such as eating and sleeping. For some it is a big factor in identity and self-esteem. And a crucial way of dealing with emotions. And of course a source of financial stability. In case you can\u2019t tell, I\u2019m a bit passionate about this being a semi-pro musician myself. ",

The best way to understand someone is to spend a lot of time with them, to listen to them and to understand their point of view. ",
