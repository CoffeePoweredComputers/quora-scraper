            "answer_text": "Mmh let's clarify the claim \u2018Monitor Headphone\u2019 first: This should at least be a headphone that delivers the closest to truth (the incoming signal) reproduces what it gets. Technically that would e.g. mean it delivers a near perfect I pulse response leading to a tremendous wide and flat frequency range without reflections (inside the phones cover are) and not strange phase effects - leading to all listenable frequencies delivered to your outer ear equal in time and level. Plus they should be as distortion free as possible, show as good as no resonances (goes also to point 1 as resonances would show in an impulse response / transient response measurement), can deliver sound over a reasonable dynamic rang plus a reasonable maximum volume. plus they should - if used professionally - be built sturdy and comfortable so they sustain a comfortable and daily use for hours and hours if needed. On the other hand they could be just labeled \u2018Monitor\u2019 and \u2018Pro\u2019 to make them shine ;) Compared to typical consumer models they will lack some features: there is no extended bassthere is not super Loudness switch (to enhance the insane bass levels even more)there is no additional super tricky heini shiny special effect built in to make your MP3s \u2018shine\u2019In short: there will be no speciality a typical consumer (say with an untrained ear) feature which lets them stand out of the masses of feature loaded \u201cBUY ME\u201d headphones\u2026 But are they suitable for enjoyable music listening? If you really, really want that bass boosted fluffy earcandy - nope! If you only want to hear that cool deep bass when it's actually there - yes! When you want to be surprised how awesome \u2018that song you love\u2019 for say years or even tenth of years really is - yes! It is - from my very personal point of view - very enjoyable to listen via good or superb headphones. With the best products you will have endless fun listening to your or new music, never feel fatigued and never feel that you actually wear a phone (that goes for the comfy ones only of course). I would suggest checking out a hifi store with a proper music source (not that giant supermarket which also has 100 headphones on one crappy source with loads of cables laid out to make the result as bad as possible) maybe at a local hifi shop or if you are lucky on a reachable headphone roadshow aka can jam. Might be an experience of a lifetime :) ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, absolutely, as long as you understand the differences and do not mind them. USUALLY (because many claim 'Monitor' status but are not really monitor quality headphones) monitor headphones are designed to: Sound very neutral and accuratehave a very wide frequency responsehave a very flat frequency responsehave very low distortionDesigned to be comfortable for long term useheavy duty build, to last through many professional sessionsThey are made to sound accurate, and not to a company sound signature, which does not mean they sound poor or bad in any way, but the designers were trying to make accurate, clear sounding headphones so a sound editor knows EXACTLY what is recorded and can adjust the sound to have the effect that the artist/film maker/etc. wants. A consumer headphone usually has a 'sound' that is part of a manufacturer's characteristics and as you go up the model range you get better quality build and sound. Some people prefer the 'sound' of a manufacturer's products, and so a neutral and accurate sounding headphone might not sound 'good' to them. I personally prefer the more neutral and accurate sound of true monitor headphones, and as you go up the models of reputable HiFi headphone manufacturers, you get closer to the same accuracy. For example, the Sennheiser HD800, being one of the very best, is extremely accurate and allows you to hear very detailed audio information, and is used by many 'pro' audio engineers. Most PRO/Monitor headphones try to achieve that for less money, slightly less accurate, and a more robust build to stand the rigors of daily professional use. ",

            "answer_text": "Certainly. Monitor headphones are made for wide and accurate frequency response. They are not made for booming bass, recessed mids, or shrill highs. Someone before me explained the EQ patterns of a flat (monitoring) vs. a tweaked (consumer) headphone. Their explanation was spot on. I digress, however. The question was if monitor headphones suitable for music listening by ordinary people. I still say yes to that. I think people would do well to hear their music as honestly as possible. No big EQ curves, boomy bass, recessed mids or shrrlill treble. No fancy shmancy stuff to adjust or polish it. The moment I first heard my studio monitor IEMs (Westone UM3X), I was truly blown away by the accuracy and frequency response. I haven\u2019t looked back since. ",

People these days will look for booming bass, thick mids, and shrill highs, and that is what they deem to be good quality sound. On the other hand, audiophiles and audio enthusiasts find flatter response headphones to be ideal because this makes the original vision of the engineers transparent. Of course, there are ordinary people who will appreciate flat response headphones, but you\u2019re less likely to bump into them. Most others will have to learn to appreciate better audio. ",
