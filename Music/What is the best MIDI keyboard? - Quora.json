            "answer_text": "I hate to use the cliche, but there is really no \u201cbest\u201d MIDI keyboard. Everything will depend on: Your use caseSkill and experienceBudgetDAW (Digital Audio Workstation)What\u2019s good for a pro studio will not be good for a home producer starting Ableton 101. That said, some of the best MIDI keyboards on the market currently are: Akai MPK Mini MK2: Great for beginners as well as experienced musicians looking for a second portable keyboard. Hallmark Akai build quality. Integrates easily with most popular DAWs. Good mix of keys and pads.Akai MPK249: Akai\u2019s \u201cpremium\u201d MIDI keyboard for professionals. This one has fantastic weighted keys and pads pulled straight from Akai\u2019s legendary MPC series.Arturia KeyStep: Has more I/O options than you could ever use. Also use a great built-in arpeggiator and sequencer. Great if you want to control an external hardware synth.Novation Launchkey: Regardless of which key configuration you use, you\u2019ll find that the Novation Launchkey keyboards do a good job of mixing price and performance. I particularly like the Novation Launchkey 25 which is a great competitor to the Akai MPK Mini MK2Nektar Panorama P4/P6: Easily one of the prettiest midi keyboards on the market. Also boasts a great semi-weighted keybed, great faders, and rock solid build quality.In general, follow a few rules when it comes to buying MIDI keyboards: Prioritize good integration with your DAW of choice. Nothing ruins the production experience more than a keyboard that struggles to integrate with your DAW. In general, most popular brands integrate well with the Ableton, FL Studio and Logic Pro.On that note, Pro Tools integration is a little iffy for most MIDI keyboards. Even the venerable NI Komplete Kontrol has to be integrated as a VSTi. I would recommend asking Avid for pointers before buying a midi keyboard for Pro Tools.Synth-action keys are good enough for most production environments. But if you know how to play the piano, consider investing in semi-weighted or weighted keybeds.A few integrated pads, knobs, faders and other control options are a welcome addition.",

            "answer_text": "I recently got an Arturia Keystep (replaced my old trusted M-Audio Keystation Mini 32) and I\u2019m amazed at the build quality. The mini-keys are slightly bigger and don\u2019t feel like a toy (the key action is very good!). And it has Aftertouch (channel), which is really something at that price point! It\u2019s a upgrade my old controller is that it has Pitch/Mod touch strips (they were buttons before on my M-Audio) which are nice. The extra connections apart from USB MIDI is also good (MIDI ports and even CV outs for your hardware synth). I also own a Beatstep Pro, so all these options will be put to good use Added bonus is also a built in Arpeggiator and Sequencer. I made a video recently about how to set up MIDI Clock sync to DAW (Logic Pro X and Presonus Studio One), so you might want to check it out:  ",
