            "answer_text": "Perhaps the question would be better if it asked, Are Alaskans Indigenous people? The perceived pejorative term Indians, was replaced by what was thought better as in Native Americans. Some now prefer indigenous people, \u2018meaning \u201cthe native or original inhabitants of the Americas\u201d. The truth is, that most indigenous people have their own language name such as the Dine, who we call Navajo, or Iswa, who we call Catawba. Alaska\u2019s indigenous people are several different tribes, including, Aleut, Inuit, Tlingit, Haida, Tsimshian, Eyak, and a number of Northern Athabasca cultures. Alaska\u2019s first people number about 119,241 (as of the 2000 census). There are 229 federally recognized Alaskan villages and five unrecognized Tlingit Alaskan Indian tribes. The debate as to whether they crossed from Siberia, or up through Tierra del Fuego, or even by boat from Polynesia, are theories unproven. However, having worked with forensic anthropologists, I can say that the skeletal remains of indigenous people are unique, and can be readily identified. The cranial structure is different from people descended from white Europeans. ",

As too your question I\u2019m sure you mean the various ethnic groups that inhabited the Americas before Europeans. And the Inuit ethnic group has inhabited Alaska for thousands of years so yes the are. Are all Alaskans part of the Inuit group? No. Yet all those born in the Americas are native to America. ",

            "answer_text": "The study of Native American populations is technically very challenging because of the widespread occurrence of European and African mixture in Native American groups. Yes, they are related. It is thought from genetic and other evidence that the Native people from Alaska, Canada and Greenland in the north to Tierra del Fuego in South America came in at least three waves. Eskimo-Aleut-Inuit-Yupik speakers are the last wave and they derive about 57% of their DNA from First Americans. As for why the Inuit-Eskimo don\u2019t want to be called \u201cIndian\u201d or \u201cNative American\u201d, it is a cultural issue. They have and had different cultures. Having a different culture is not about \u201cbeing related\u201d ",

But I\u2019m not Alaska Native. My ancestors were overwhelmingly of European descent, both of my parents were born in California, and so on. Alaska Native is a specific designation based on ethnic, linguistic, and cultural heritage, and no matter how many potlatches I attend or how many invitationals I dance, it is not a designation I can- or should- ever earn.
