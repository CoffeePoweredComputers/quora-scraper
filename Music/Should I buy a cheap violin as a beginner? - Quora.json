            "answer_text": "one important rule in the field of instrument playing, for practice always prefer the hard/average quality instrument and for performance always have the best quality possible. there are some technical reasons behind this. if you start playing on rough/hard violin, obviously you will try to create best possible melodious sound out of that average quality instrument because everybody in the world play it to produce as beautiful sound as he can. so this will develop your art much better than practicing on high quality instrument. it will help you to balance between force , pressure, weight and timings while dealing with bow. you may have observed that the experts player can create a good tone even on the violin that we people might think as a low quality, they are able to do so because their skills of balancing this parameters (force, pressure, weight etc) became too fine due to practice a lot. so whenever you will learn the instrument, learn it technically well , don\u2019t think or worry about the fact that your violin is not sounding well. you will have it with time.and when you will switch to high quality violin, you can feel the difference, how it is easy for you now, because you are actually switching from tough one to easy one.",

            "answer_text": "Buying an expensive instrument right off the bat isn't a good idea, you want a good reputable yet affordable violin. I highly recommend the Mendini violins they range in price (starting at about $65) on Amazon, and come with everything you need to get started, bow, strings rosin, case, shoulder rest, and even an extra bridge. Before purchasing a violin online you need to be sized, to do that you need to go to a local instrument store and have them find out what violin size is correct for you. I hope this helps :) ",
