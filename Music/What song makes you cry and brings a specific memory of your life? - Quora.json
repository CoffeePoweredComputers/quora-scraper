            "answer_text": "Bollywood songs are perfect for all situations. They give you words when you are out of vocabulary during emotional distress. They remind you of your past experiences. There are two songs and hearing them i start crying immediately. One is \u201cfulo ka taro ka sab ka kehna hai, ek hazaro mai meri behna hai\u201d. It means a brother os praising his lovely sister saying all heavens and earth are saying that she is the only one amongst thousands. This song reminds me of my only brother whom i lost when i was 8 yo and he was 17 yo. He committed suicide as my father used treat him very badly and nobody supported him. Not even my mom. She herself was scared of my father. Another song is \u201csolah baras ki bali umar ko salam. E pyar teri pehli nazar ko salam\u201d. It means a salute to the teenage love and the love\u2019s first sight. This song reminds me of my love. Mine is a love marriage. We married after facing a lot of opposition from both the sides. Now even after 21 years of marriage we are alone. One more reasom i have to remember this song is that after marriage i had learned that he married me only for my money. Both the above songs make me sad as it reminds me a lot. I am not going into details of my experiences and feelings with regard to the songs as it diverts the subject and my husband also refers to Quora some times. ",
