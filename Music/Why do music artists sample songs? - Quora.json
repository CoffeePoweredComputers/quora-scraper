            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a way to \u201cbuild\u201d a song. It\u2019s like in classical music from long ago, when a composer would use another composer\u2019s existing work as the basis for something new. They would always acknowledge the source by calling it \u201cVariations on a theme by Berlioz\u201d or some such. As a songwriter, I understand that sampling can be a shortcut. It\u2019s a very different thing from inventing something new. Also, there are degrees of sampling\u2014you can sample a distinctive bass line (for example) and then build an entire song from that, like Vanilla Ice did with the Bowie/Queen tune. Or, you can simply \u201cquote\u201d a small bit of a song within a song that is otherwise original. The band Sugarloaf did this with their hit \u201cDon\u2019t Call Us, We\u2019ll Call You\u201d, sampling the very well-known riff from The Beatles\u2019 \u201cI Feel Fine\u201d. They even acknowledge that they did this in the lyrics: \u201cJust like John Paul and George!\u201d. But that sampled riff is just a brief moment within a song that otherwise has nothing to do (musically) with the Beatles tune. Speaking for myself, I find the former idea kind of lame. I don\u2019t have much respect for a song like that\u2014it\u2019s like an unacknowledged \u201cvariations on a theme\u201d. The latter method can be done very cleverly, especially when it\u2019s an obvious \u201cshout out\u201d to the original\u2014sort of a gesture of respect. ",

            "answer_text": "To answer this you have to take it back to the beginning. The first sample of a song were DJs in the Bronx playing the break (the best part) in a record back to back so break dancers could dance. This was coupled with the fact that in New York the music budgets in schools were cut and many of the hip hop pioneers didn\u2019t know how to play instruments or could afford them. When the SP1200 and the MPC came out it allowed DJs to sample the break as opposed to playing it back to back. They also sampled instruments and would play them on drum machines. Fast forward to today, people still sample because the beat is recognizable and people are drawn to what they know. It is used as a selling technique and a way to make music from music. ",
