            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll tell you my story, and maybe some of you can relate. There are people who seem to have a gift when it comes to music. Some people study it and can learn. And some people never learn. I\u2019ve heard gifted people claim that anyone can learn to sing. I don\u2019t know if that is true. For three of my middle high school years, my parents sent me to a private school in Montreal. Teachers in the public school had told them I was bright but not applying myself. Of course I didn't\u2026 I didn't care about performance in school. I had zero motivation. I must have been 12 or 13 at the time. So, for reasons that I only slightly understood, every day, there I was in this school far across town. Actually, the small classes were rather nice, and some of the other students were more likeable than I had found in in the local high school. There were music classes. For some mysterious reason, we all were to have recorders \u2014 not tape recorders \u2014 those boring wooden flutes. Somehow I ended up with a used one. The other kids, who'd been in the school for years, could play a few uninteresting tunes. I don't recall any classes to teach how to even play a scale or make the little flute sound more interesting than a whistle. I certainly never played any tunes on it. I had it for a long time and frequently wondered what I was supposed to do with it. I do remember a seminal class at that school with the music teacher. I even remember his name: Mario Duschenes. I think I know his name because he became something of a Montreal celebrity in later years, so there was some reinforcement. That day we were supposed to sing together. Duschenes was in front, facing us; and we were all together, somehow, facing him. I seem to recall I was in the back of the class, centre-left (I can still picture it). Since I've never been able to sing on key (I don't think I really know what it would feel like to be 'on key') I was probably singing the wrong pitch. Mr. Duschenes stopped the group and announced that someone was off. I didn't know what he meant, but I was attentive enough to figure out it was likely that since I was the new boy in the room, I was one of the offending singers. There was only one remedy possible \u2014 since if I was \"off\" and had no idea what being \"on\" could possibly mean \u2014 I simply stopped singing. To keep from being visible in the class, I moved my lips. My action was obviously appropriate! Mario continued with the class, and must have been satisfied with the sound. That day, and forever since, I've known that the way to sing in a group, and not disrupt the occasion, was to be silent. Looking back, I find Duschenes' failure to be able to teach me in his class, when that was his job, is a source of considerable resentment. In more recent years, I have spent hours with musical instruments, and computer programs, trying to discover how to make music\u2026 something that is so easy for many people. I think if my teacher had some real teaching ability, he might have unraveled this knot in my head when I was young enough to make that a simple task. Whether that was true will not be known. I do know he never tried. In later years I would learn to be an audio technician, and I was even responsible for managing the development of a recording studio. Now, in my seventies, I am exploring music and audio with my computer. Recently I did take a singing class. The instructor thinks she could teach me to sing on key, but her experience with people like me is that it takes many months. I mention this, because it would not be reasonable to conclude that my lack of ability was due to my lack of diligence. The teacher I had when I was a young teenager more than failed me, he hurt me. I suspect if I'd never been in his class, that with my own sense of discovery, I would have found music during those years when my father wanted to play the organ and there was some music in my house. Instead, in the music class, I learned to shut out that world. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all there is singing and singing, and then there is teaching. Let me explain. 1.\tThere is classical singing. About 1 in 50.000 people according to Richard Miller in The structure of singing have the kind of voice which \u2013 with good training \u2013 might make a person into a good classical singer. Then this person has to be very healthy, motivated, intelligent enough to learn to read scores and foreign languages etc. and so on. Then he or she has to learn singing, which is a daunting task. For a talented person, it\u2019s easy to learn to sing reasonably well as an amateur. This task however can\u2019t be compared to singing reasonably well on a professional level. What singers have to learn, is to control muscles many of which can\u2019t be consciously controlled. What makes things even worse is that the smallest tension will be heard in the voice, in this aspect singing can be compared to sports like Olympic gym. What they also have to learn, is to produce a specific set overtones, that enables them to be heard in a large venue, even over an orchestra or a grand piano playing loud. This can only be done be breathing in a very special way, and ensuring the diaphragm stays high and other muscles in the lower body region have a very specific tension, that changes depending on voice color, volume and pitch. Another complication is, that the sounds we hear when we are singing, are a very bad guide: the proximity effect and other effects lure us into hearing a good tone when we produce a bad one and vice versa. Even if we learn to recognize the right tone once it is strong enough to be heard back via the room acoustics, we can\u2019t control it while singing. Since our brains are always 0.3 s late, when we try to control ourselves we\u2019re doing that behind the fact. The only thing that helps is to breathe and start a new phrase without making the mistakes we have heard in the last one. Now you might think, a good teacher can help a singer with all of this. Don\u2019t be too optimistic here. We\u2019ll discuss this in 3. 2.\tThen there is pop singing. Many pop singers can\u2019t sing, but most people in the audience don\u2019t hear it. Apart from that there are mikes and a lot of software to make somebody sound a lot better than in reality, louder, in tune, more brilliant, more beautiful etc. Of course at many concerts pop singers don\u2019t sing at all, they just mimic singing while the music is played back and then there are the likes of Milly Vanilly who never sing at all, not even in the studio. There are some exceptions though, who really can sing and made a career based on their singing instead of based on other things, but technically you should count them partly under 1. They sing in a more or less classical way, but can afford to produce very weak tones, which are then amplified via the microphone, and can afford all kind of technical mistakes. Why? Because there is much strict set of criteria for a good tone. A singer can suggest he is making an ugly tone as a means of expression e.g. or sing in a husky voice like he\u2019s been singing in bars for a decade or so. Technical bad singing will also not be punished by the acoustics, they can use tones nobody would hear without a mike and of course sing pop music, which has much less dynamics and fewer high and low notes. Still, for those pop singers who strive for a harmonic and beautiful tone, many of the things mentioned in 1 are also true to a large extent, so it really can be damned hard. 3.\tTeaching. The pedagogics of singing is a mess. There are some teachers who teach in a modern way, and are aware of the scientific knowledge connected to singing. In the USA there is the National Association of Teachers of Singing, that really does makes an effort in the field of integration the results of scientific research into their teaching. Many teachers however, still teach singing based on knowledge that has proven to be wrong 150 years ago. This is due to the importance of tradition in music. Even though it\u2019s nice to hear the words from someone who taught the teacher of a teacher who taught the teacher etc. of your teacher when it comes to embellishments in Mozart e.g., this kind of old fashioned knowledge doesn\u2019t help you technically. And the real important knowledge of Bel Canto is lost anyway, to a large extent. Even more important: Most teachers use imagery rather than pedagogics. They say something like: imagine the top of your head being drawn towards the ceiling. Or: imagine the sound pops out of your eyes. That might be of any help for some, but will be very bad for others. Good teachers might not use imagery at all, or only if it seems to help and then adjust it to an individual student. But bad teachers just apply the same imagery to every student. I heard 19 different stories from teachers on how you should use vocal support (on how you keep the diaphragm high etc.), 18 of which were wrong. Most teachers tell you to sing in the mask and feel the vibrations. Why? Because you have cavities in your face that are filed with the sounds of your singing and then vibrate and act as a radiator for the sound. The sound is radiated by those cavities. Really? BS. In a scientific experiment they were filled up with wax, only to find out that those cavities don\u2019t play a role at all. And the vibrations you feel, can be completely different and felt at different places from the vibrations another person feels, while you both are singing well, technically. Many teachers use a technique or rather a set of tricks that their last teacher taught them. This might have helped them, but is very likely not be of any help to others. This is especially true if your teacher is a woman and you\u2019re a man. And then I didn\u2019t even mention the difficulties in the psychological field: you can only learn if you trust somebody, e.g. and have the feeling your teachers means it well. Just look at the Callas or Schwarzkopf masterclasses to see how difficult it can be to give a student that feeling. If you don\u2019t believe me: read Great singers on great singing (Jerome Hines), and you\u2019ll find out that almost all singers in the book had many bad teachers, until they finally found a good one. So now you know a couple of reasons why it is difficult to sing. There are many more, like the pressure to sing in front of a large audience if you know that you can\u2019t consciously control all the muscles involved. Now next time you hear somebody sing, especially classical, and have a big mouth about the things the singer is doing wrong, think about the things mentioned here and shut up, or rather applaude loudly when somebody manages to sing really like a God, because it basically is a miracle.
