            "answer_text": "It depends on your style and how many different sounds you wish to emulate . but remember the more guitars you have the less you are going to be really accurate on any one instrument . Steve Morse for example sticks to one guitar to really get the instinctual feel of that instrument And as a result is a much more fluent picker. To illustrate every guitar has a little different spacing between strings , a little different Body size and may even sit at a different angle when you play it . So it takes a little adjustment to switch instruments all the time . Back to how many guitars for electric  and as a Rock player , to emulate the main players you would need a Fender Strat to sound like Jimi HendriX or Ritchie Blckmore  , a Gibson Les Paul  To sound like Jimmy Page or many 90s grunge players and possibly one if the many 80's electrics like an Ibanez or Kramer to sound like Eddie Van H or Steve Vai .  For a country sound or say Keith Richards he plays a Telecastor. this also brings up your amp sound which has just as major an impact on your sound. . when I first started it took me years of fumbling through amps and guitars trying to figure out why my sound was 'different'than what  I was working towards . Hope this is a little bit of a start for you . ",

            "answer_text": "That largely depends on the genre you play. Like if you are a lead player who plays with different songs you might like to have guitars with different sound tonalities but unlike flute or mouth organ its not a necessity for the player to have multiple options.   ",
