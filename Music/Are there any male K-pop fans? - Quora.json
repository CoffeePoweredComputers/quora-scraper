            "answer_text": "Yes there are. BTOB fans are called Melody (or Melodies). Along the ways, some started to call male melodies MELODUDES. Sound cute, right? Wait for this\u2026. there are also MELOKIDS! and yes, you are right, they are kids who happened to be fond of those BTOB boys. One very adorable kid is Naoki, who is a big fan of Lee Minhyuk. And yes, we adult melodies are really really jealous of Naoki coz Naoki got a chance to kiss Minhyuk\u2026 on the lips! Back to male fans\u2026. some Melodudes said that BTOB boys are like friends they feel they can hang out with. Or older brothers they can depend on. Several yt reaction videos are made by males, and they showed their admiration not too different from female fans. Some melodudes called these boys HYUNG, which means older brother (some shout out their HYUNG really loud when BTOB were on stage, or even on outdoor occasions. Cute, right?), And BTOB boys were not afraid to entertain their male fans equally enthusiastic, being the biggest fans of BTOB themselves haha Actually, fanboying is not a new thing. My husband is a big big fan of Pink Floyd. And we have been a big fans since the 90s. So yeah, male fans do exist for performer any where in the world, be in the UK or in Korea. ",
