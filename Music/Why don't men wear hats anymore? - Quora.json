            "answer_text": "As I brought up in another topic, my neighbor and I actually share our hat collection, which is rather large at this point and garners quite a few compliments \u2013 but I'll get back to the moment. There are pictures of my dad in hats. The man lived to his late 70s and was a hoarder of TV show portions and yet there was not a single hat in the house that I ever recall seeing outside those pictures. From my memories of those photos albums, as they are not convenient at the moment, just about every hat looks the same, although I sincerely doubt that they are the same hat. Granted many are black-and-white photos, my point is there's not much deviation in style. I also remember my father's opinion of the tie:\"Not even a monkey is stupid enough to take a noose around its neck and tighten it.\" Which is why he refused to wear one outside of work regardless of the occasion. The same man who to his dying day always wore a complete business suit regardless of occasion, although occasionally he would take off the jacket was hot enough \u2013 believe me, I paid for them. He would claim that he had nothing to wear on a yearly basis and I would drive my best friend Bobby to the store with us so I wouldn't have to suffer alone as he was fitted for several more suits at over thousand dollars that I learned to set aside for the inevitable, \"I have nothing to wear!\" For the record, after his death, I would find he had hidden numerous articles of clothing, many of them unopened, for what I believe is the sole purpose of me buying him all new outfits every year \u2013 for an old guy, he was very fashion conscious in the sense of wanting to follow his own idea what was new and fashionable. Which is kind of my point, so forgive my long-winded of getting to it.In modern culture, men's hats would be extraordinarily inconvenient to the furniture \u2013 especially bumping against the higher back chairs. Most establishments will require them to be removed and the owner would have to keep track of them as well as find a place to stow them. The hat would work against the climate control indoors and against perspiration outdoors  {by which I mean fashion/business hats and not meaning such as baseball/trucker caps, which are obviously designed for utilitarian purposes}.  The the brim lining also often cause an indentation of the skin and in sensitive skin would also cause a rash. Hats are difficult to clean, most people don't, and as such they eventually acquire enough dirt to become an irritant even to someone without sensitive skin \u2013 especially if that person is bald, as was my dad. I think my dad saw the hat as one step above the aforementioned parable of the monkey with the noose around its neck a.k.a. the tie.For someone who never threw anything away, not even catalogs that were intended to order other catalogs, he didn't have a single hat in the house \u2013 I think that speaks strongly to how strongly he felt against them. Absolutely no benefit in a lot of grief I would imagine to wearing a men's hat as part of his daily \"uniform\". Now let me return to how I opened this post \u2013 my neighbor and I share a hat collection that we almost never go out without and almost always get complemented on :-) I obviously didn't always wear hats. I certainly didn't my father was still alive. I got introduced to them as a fashion accessory by a different neighbor when going to a new church. The variety of fashion choices in hats for women is absolutely astounding!  You might as well locked a kid overnight in a candy store, as here were all these respectable women wearing huge pieces of art on their heads and sometimes even changing out their hats {or even the entire outfit \u2013 hat inclusive} midway through the preacher's service. I would soon learn that the starting price for some of these averaged at hundred dollars US and only skyrocketed from there, so I learned very quickly to shop the secondary market. Still, what I want you to understand is the concept of art versus the concept of utilitarianism. The hats that my neighbor and I share are literally extensions of that style I first at that church \u2013 artwork that you wear {even if this particular neighbor's never going to step foot in a church on a bet ;-) The hats that my father was expected to wear during his day were not only copies of what everyone else was wearing, it was a hardship to wear them \u2013 a practice that deserved to die out under these particular cultural constraints. And to be fair, the practice of men wearing hats hasn't completely died out.  Aside from the obvious utilitarian ones, I still see them occasionally. Also, giving credit where credit is due, during the winter weather some of the men in my area can get really creative with their outdoor only hats :-) ",

            "answer_text": "I answered this in another thread but here it is verbatim: The reason men no longer wear hats is three-fold: changes in transportation, hygiene, and hair. A man's hat was used primarily as a means of protection against rain, dust, cold, and the sun. With the growing popularity of the automobile as the transportation of choice for many Americans, the hat became less necessary as men were no longer required to walk long distances outdoors. The images you've seen of streets in, say, New York was probably a veritable sea of men in felt hats precisely because walking was one of the only means of getting from point A to point B. Because automobiles offer built in protection from the elements, the hat became redundant. The second reason the hat lost its popularity is because of the emphasis on hygiene that developed in the late 20th century. In the 1950's, hair washes were weekly instead of the daily ones that we do today. Because hair washes were done infrequently, a hat was necessary to keep the dust and dirt away.   A sea of hats in Chicago. Finally, the hair fashions of the 1960's and 70's meant that men cared more about their hair and how it looked. In the golden age of hats, men typically had trimmed hair in order to ensure that extraneous strands of hair over their forehead would not stick out from underneath their hat. As men started to care more for how their hair looked, the less reason there was to wear a hat that might crush or mess up their 'do. It is interesting to note that back when men wore hats, it was considered subversive to not wear hats. Now, it's the people that wear hats that give the impression that they're going against the grain:   T-Pain in a top/stovepipe hat.
