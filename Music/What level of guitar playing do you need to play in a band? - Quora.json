            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll give you the basics of what is expected of you. First, let me say this: you can jump in and play with people at any time, as long as they understand you\u2019re not very good at playing. This means you may not know a lot of chords, may struggle with keeping up, may struggle with playing too fast. But that\u2019s okay, you have to start somewhere. And if everyone isn\u2019t particularly good at playing, then you\u2019re all in the same boat and it becomes about learning to play with other musicians for all of you. And that is awesome! However, if you want to be ready to play like you actually know what you\u2019re doing before joining a band, here is a list of things you should be working on. Now, you don\u2019t have to be great at any or all of them, but you should be working these things out, and show improvement over time, enough for the other musicians to be okay with what you struggle with\u2026 because all musicians struggle with something or a few things. So, here is the list\u2026 When you play with other musicians, there is an expectation you know how to keep time - steady time. So you need to work with a metronome. This is the best tool to help you learn to keep a steady beat and time. You see, too many players rely upon the drummer as their time keeper. But it isn\u2019t their job to keep the band on beat and in time. It is everyone\u2019s job. So do not neglect this important job - learning to stay on beat and in time! The drummer will be most appreciative. Rhythm. Ninety percent of your playing is going to be rhythm guitar, not \u201clead\u201d guitar solos. So, you need to know how to strum things, know multiple strum patterns, and you need to know your chords, and be able to learn new chords pretty quickly (within a couple days at most to where you can play them in context of the songs they\u2019re in). You need to know how to take direction when you do join a band. If you are not the leader, somebody invariably will \u201ctake the lead\u201d in directing the band, if they haven\u2019t already done so. And if everyone is okay with the \u201cleader\u201d, then let it be and let them lead, as long as it is what and where you want to focus. You don\u2019t need to be great. You just need to be able to keep up. Learn a bunch of songs and play the rhythm part along with the record. Can you keep up? If you can mostly keep time, keep up with the record, that is great! This is what you\u2019ll be doing with the band. Learn a lot of different styles. Don\u2019t stick with just your favourite. You cut yourself off from some great opportunities when you focus only on one thing. Trust me, variety is awesome because you\u2019ll learn more stuff sooner than if you stick with one style/genre. Learning to solo takes time, so even if you want to be a \u201clead\u201d guitar player, you will find a lot more bands in need of a good rhythm player. Learn a couple scales. The Pentatonic minor scale is important. The Major scale is also very, very important. Learn these scales in all five positions up the neck, and also learn them in every key - especially E, A, D, B Take some lessons from a good teacher if you are not already doing so; they\u2019ll help you really get yourself ready to play with other musicians if you want to be decent before you begin playing in a band. But like I said, you can jump in at any point in your progress. And as long as the other players are at about your same level or slightly better, and don\u2019t mind including you, you\u2019re good to go! Also, once you\u2019re in a group, you invariably want to play with people who are better than you, too. They don\u2019t have to be part of the band, you can play with them separately. This will really inspire you to play beyond yourself. And, honestly? Bass players - good bass players - are even more sought after than guitar players. Everyone wants to play guitar, few want to play bass. And a good bass player is worth their weight in gold, no matter if it is just a garage band or a major touring act. (If you are seeking lessons, I teach via Skype. Contact me via private message if you are interested. My rates are reasonable.) ",

            "answer_text": "It so depends on the band and your role in it. Lets look at a minimum and a midlevel case while understand the upper limit is way up there. For the minimum, let\u2019s say you are the main singer in a singer/songwriter kind of outfit playing cafe and bar gigs. In that role, you might need an acoustic and maybe a basic electric. You would need to be able to play all chord changes in all the songs, while singing. You might only need a basic clean tone, in tune and not too loud. You provide the harmonic framework, just as you would in your own bedroom rehersals. The other players should support you with complimentary parts. So, in this case, not a particularly high level. In the midline example, we will say you are the only guitar player in a cover band, doing only background vocals. Now you have a couple of guitars on an AB switch and a pedal board into a decent amp. You mostly play chords, but in more varied voicings, in more places on the neck. When there are guitar solos, you play them, at least suggesting the original. You are turning knobs, switching pedals and changing instruments to sound like the originals. You will not only understand the tunes and your options for chords, scales and tones, you will need to communicate with the bass player and maybe a keyboard player, in a musically technical way. You may need to transpose songs into new keys to allow the singer to hit the right pitches. In this case, you need to be a mid pack guitarist with a broad catalog of chords, be a fair soloist, know basic music theory and be able to manage your tone while performing. ",

            "answer_text": "A VERY good question actually, though rather loaded. There is some good news and some bad news here and I\u2019ll start with the bad news: It\u2019s a LOT more difficult than it used to be. This is mostly due to a perfect storm of a. rock/metal/punk etc. going back to being more underground b. hiphop/EDM/bubblegum pop etc. being the mainstream and having been for about 30 years c. just about everything on the guitar having already been done before and d. way more gear being way more readily available (though good, solid pro-gear and nice guitars will cost a month\u2019s rent and your soul) thus a HUGE glut of guitarists and e. thanks to the internet/youtube era it\u2019s a lot more competitive than it was back when Zappa and Hendrix had their time. It\u2019s all actually less a blame thing and more of an inevitability due to time and wear and tear of the artform. That\u2019s just part of it though, it\u2019s a lot more difficult because there are almost no more garage bands anymore. It just sucks for contemporary musicians to get their feet off the ground now and it\u2019s a LOT more difficult to manage the expenses of having good gear, practice space where you can play without having the cops called on you (if you\u2019re unfortunate enough you might have to pay to rent a studio room,) actually joining or starting a band in the first place with others that have similar levels of dedication/taste/vision/goals (especially a bass player of ANY sort PERIOD) and scheduling rehearsals and gigs\u2026 and even if you are fortunate enough to come across that and DO get paying gigs expect to make less than peanuts let alone minimum wage. True, if you\u2019re dedicated and persistent enough you can also be fortunate enough to sign on to a major label but oh MAN is that ever a temple of traps now that I can go on about ALL NIGHT. It\u2019s so bad you can \u201cmake it\u201d and STILL end up owing the label money! Self-producing is the way to go in these modern times IF you can do it. Also a lot of the difficulty has to do with the cutthroat competitiveness of it now. As I mentioned, back when Zappa and Hendrix were huge almost nobody had their skills (save classical and jazz purists but that\u2019s a completely different ballpark than what I\u2019m talking.) Back then in the good ol\u2019 days of guitar, it was still fresh and new; you didn\u2019t have to be FANTASTIC in order to make a good living off of it. Now in this youtube era all you have to do is choose a random video of someone playing guitar and it\u2019s quite likely they would\u2019ve been good enough to be a big star back in the 60s - 90s. It\u2019s just consequence\u2026 to the point where it\u2019s just not as impressive as it used to be sadly in this era where you can go on the net and fairly easily find a video of some 7 year old girl in some hut in Indonesia (for example) playing Petrucci stuff with no sweat like she wrote it. It can be flat-out discouraging for a lot of people\u2026 especially in this \u201cthere\u2019s a school for literally everything\u201d American Idol \u201cmusic is a competition because everything is competition\u201d era\u2026 at least back in the 70s and 80s there was Punk Rock. I\u2019m sorry to be so somber about this all\u2026 I just feel really sorry for guitarists in this day and age; they\u2019ve got it so rough. Having great skills at the guitar in these times is like being a multi-millionaire in a dead, over-inflated currency that can\u2019t be exchanged. Now for the GOOD news: It\u2019s STILL all completely subjective. Every player has a different experience so there\u2019s no \u201cone size fits all\u201d answer. If you are doing this for fun and joy ALONE you will have a far easier time with all of this, so long as you can communicate it well to others and are crystal clear about it\u2026 it\u2019s pretty Zen actually. I also say no matter what you do, where you are with your playing\u2026 yes work on your chops/getting better but I don\u2019t recommend obsessing over them (especially watching/comparing yourself to viral youtube guitarists) otherwise you will NEVER feel \u201cgood enough\u201d to even TRY auditioning/starting a band. I made that fatal burnout-inducing mistake back when I used to play/was serious about playing and MAN do I ever regret it. I\u2019d rather be a decent rhythm player with the courage to even TRY auditioning/starting a band/writing songs than be able to play Allan Holdsworth, Joe Pass, Paco De Lucia, Michael Romero etc. in my sleep but too afraid of what \u201cothers\u201d (usually simply other musicians) think to actually do something with it. TL;DR What level of guitar playing do you need to play in a band? If you ask me, there is no definitive answer as there are more variables than I can count. Just remember, don\u2019t become so critical of yourself that you won\u2019t try and find YOUR answer to this. Best wishes! ",

            "answer_text": " ANGUS YOUNG WITH GIBSON SG. I think if you can play basic chords on guitar you can play in a band, two examples that indicate this come from my reading of books about ACDC and JOHNNY CASH. JOHNNY CASH \u201cI was there when it happened\" a title from a Johnny Cash song, was used as the title of his bassist and one time manager, Marshall Grant\u2019s book on his time with Cash, who stated when they first got together as friends in Memphis on the weekends, Johnny Cash, Luther Perkins and Marshall Grant all played acoustic guitars together when singing. Johnny said one day, or evening, something like, \u201cIf we wanna be famous like Elvis and make a record we better learn to play other instruments!\u201d [meaning Bass and Lead Guitar]. Marshall Grant said he had never played a bass before but borrowed one from a friend, he didn't know how to tune it so got someone else to teach him, when he did learn to play it he got well known for his \u2018slap-pick' style which added percussion to their first recordings. They didn't have a drummer at the start and W.S. Holland was brought in later, as was D.J. Fontana who joined Elvis and the Blue Moon Boys (Scotty Moore and Bill Black).  The Blue Moon Boys, Bill Black (Bass), Elvis Presley (acoustic guitar) and Scotty Moore (lead guitar.) Luther Perkins bought a second hand electric guitar which had a stuck \u2018volume' knob, which was stuck in the high volume position. To counter this and not drown out the other guys, Johnny suggested he weave a dollar bill between the strings, this also provided a percussive sound and his style of dulling the strings (palm-muting) when picking gave the band the \u2018Johnny Cash sound'. Johnny Cash also strummed pretty hard and had a habit of simply placing his fingers across the strings without pushing them down on the fretboard and strumming, this was another percussive style that can be heard on many of his early Sun Records recordings. So what I am saying here is these guys used or accidently invented their own playing styles using simple chords but gave them their distinctive \u2018boom-chicka-boom' sound which was used wonderfully in train songs to copy the sounds of the clickety-clack of train wheels across railway tracks.  Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Two, Luther Perkins (lead guitar) and Marshall Grant (bass) [not shown]. ACDC The ACDC sound is instantly recognised by Rock fans the world over, and considering they mostly played basic chords (or power chords) they created a hard rock sound. All through their years of recording and playing live concerts, the brothers, Angus Young on his Gibson SG and older brother, the late Malcolm Young on his Gretsch guitar created great riffs many of them starting with Malcolm on rhythm guitar. Their style included plenty of palm-muting, hitting certain strings of a chord, hammer-ons, pull-offs, basic amp settings on full volume, a little sustain and other settings at about mid range on Marshall Amps. So you can play in any band really simply by playing basic chords, its all really a matter of technique, creating your own style of playing. Kurt Cobain played some pretty insane chords as a left-handed guitar player, as did Jimi Hendrix who could strum and pick a left-handed or right-handed guitar upside down. Early BeachBoys guitarist, Glen Campbell (known for his country music) played lead guitar on most of their early hits. What was remarkable about that? He was naturally left-handed but played right-handed guitars, right-handed.  Glen Campbell guitar solos 1960-2000. ",

As long as they share the same vision with their band companions, they might be able to contribute enough in the band to feel musically comfortably. Playing in a band should be fun! I guess that your question in som way reflects a notion that there is a certain level you must reach before you start advertising for yourself as a guitarist. What I recommend is this: Learn the Basic chords, and learn som strumming and picking techniques. Also try to learn som easy solos, and songs you like to play. Then its time to search for bandmates. Important: playing together is something different than playing alone. Be open about your skilles and fars. When your playing with others, remember that we are bor with two ears and one mouth, or in this case - a guitar. Be polite, dont imagine youre a guitar hero, and listen to the other people in the band. Do not play much louder than the other. Hopefully you and youre bandmates get along and are having fun.

Outside of soloing, the best thing a guitar player can do when playing rhythm is, hold it,\u2026..not much, and do it in time. A lot depends on the size of the band. In a trio he/she has to do more work/playing, but I just cant tell you how many guitarists try to play on every beat and usually way to loud. Typically a band has 4 or more people playing instruments and if every one is playing as much as they can, then it just comes out as a wall of noise. Oh your friends may like it but really it ain\u2019t good. All that extra stuff may sound good in the bedroom but on stage it just takes away from the groove that a good bass and drums are trying to create. So really the answer to your question is to play like an expensive dinner, a small amount with great taste. ",

Play with a band who cater to an audience that is more forgiving. Play at old people home, play at Church, play at the hospital at the cancer ward. I\u2019ve done it and it is very affirmative. Also, you learn valuable lessons that you don\u2019t want to learn gigging for a paying audience. These lessons include the basics of gigging, equipment failure, spare guitar, sound failure, load in, load out, *playing to make the audience happy* and not playing what you want to play, labeling your equipments not losing cables, dropping and tripping over your guitar. Playing for 50 minutes without a break. What to do on stage when you are not playing in the song. What to do if one member is missing. Covering others during their weak part. Having a good time so the audience will have a good time. You are going to learn a lot - especially if you have not gigged before. Just because the audience is not paying, you still need to be professional and treat them with respect. That will carry on with you in your whole career. ",

When I was in high school, some one offered to sell me a guitar and I turned them down. Then they told me it was only $16 and I said what the heck. That's how I started playing guitar. I started My first band a couple weeks later and self described it as pro nuke junk rock - the final battle. To join, you could not know how to play your instrument and the songs were improvised on the spot. We had the police called on us a couple times. A year later I had disbanded because I got too good just fiddling around and it didn't sound the same anymore. I discovered I could sing and have been focusing on that. Today, if you want to be in a band with me, you better be damn good or you won't make the cut. Time changes and we all start somewhere. And hopefully we grow. So personnel changes Happen because of that. Its ok. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "When you want to play three chord songs three chords will do. More important are things like discipline, choosing a 'repertoire', wllingness to listen to each other, forgive each others mistakes, but be critical at the same time. When you start performing, the audience will respond, how do you deal with that response. How do you deal with the attention (some members will get more attention, probably not proportional to the contribution to the band). How do you behave on stage, do you all pose \"look at me!\" at the same time? Are all of you shoegazers/wallflowers? When some girls start complaining to one of the members about some of the songs, will you remove those songs? Money, rehearsal room, transport, practical things.. The casual image of bands often denies they have these things sorted out. ",
