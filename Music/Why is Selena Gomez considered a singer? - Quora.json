            "answer_text": "Artist Biography by Matt Collar  Selena Gomez is a multi-talented performer with featured roles on the screen, both small and big, and a musical career that reached the summit of the charts from the very beginning. Her group Selena Gomez & the Scene issued a trio of breezy modern pop albums from 2009 to 2011 that each reached the Top Ten. After going solo, she scored a pair of number ones with the more adult-oriented Stars Dance (2013) and Revival (2015), then branched out into new sounds on collaborations with Kygo (\"It Ain't Me\") and Marshmello (\"Wolves\"). She hit the top of the singles chart for the first time with \"Lose You to Love Me\" (2019), a soul-searching ballad that delved into Gomez's real-life relationships and marked a new openness in her lyrical approach. The single's subsequent parent release, Rare (2020), became her third straight number one album. To know more, visit (click on) Selena Gomez | Biography & History | AllMusic Hope This Helps ;) ",

            "answer_text": "You know the press release that goes out to announce what artist is attached to what project, well it is usually written by an intern working for the agent of the artist. If said artist is referred to in said copy as a singer, when they have worked in other areas of the industry it can be due to the artist deciding to go in a specific direction. Part of a rebranding or the last success they saw was in that area. Selena is currently doing music, and is trying executive production, so perhaps she is slowly transitioning to a behind the scenes roll. Maybe shevno longer wants to act, as it can be exhausting to channel another personality for hours a day. Or perhaps whatever media source you saw that prompted you inquiry was lazy. It could be anything or simply an over site. ",
