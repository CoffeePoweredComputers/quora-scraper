            "answer_text": "Here is something crucially important for non-Christians, and even Christians who do not study the Bible well enough, to know about Jesus Christ: as God the Son, Jesus was worshipped, is still worshiped and will be worshipped throughout eternity. Before God the Father brought His firstborn (Jesus) into the world, He commanded all His angels to worship His Son (Hebrews 1:6) who created and upholds the entire universe (1:2, 3), who is the radiance of the glory of God (1:3), who is the exact imprint of God\u2019s nature (1:3), who is addressed as God by the Father Himself (1:8) and who is the eternal, immutable Creator referred to as Jehovah by David the great king of Israel (1:10-12; comp Psalm 45:6\u20137), Little wonder, as soon as the Magi laid eyes on the infant Jesus, \u201cthey fell down and worshiped him\u201d (Matthew 2:11). So Jesus did not need to say that people should worship Him. In fact, all through the earthly ministry of Jesus, people who recognized His divinity voluntarily and spontaneously worshipped Him. The following are some mememorable examples of Jesus accepting freewill worship: a healed leper knelt before Jesus in worship - Matthew 8:2a reputable ruler knelt before Jesus after He had healed his Son - Matthew 9:18the disciples of Jesus worshipped Him after He walked on water- Matthew 14:33a Canaanite woman worshipped Jesus in anticipation of her daughter's healing - Matthew 15:25the mother of James and John also knelt in worship before Jesus - Matthew 20:20a man tormented by evil spirits dramatically worshipped Jesus - Mark 5:6a healed blind man said to Jesus, \u201cLord, I believe, and he worshipped him\" - John 9:38some women who met Jesus after His resurrection clasped His feet and worshiped Him - Matthew 28:8-9; comp Mark 16:1; Luke 24:10all of the visible disciples worshipped Jesus after His resurrection - Matthew 28:17when Jesus appeared to all the disciples, Thomas worshipped Him by responding, \"My Lord and my God!\" - John 20:28Notice that in none of the above instances do we see Jesus forbidding those worshiping Him, as did mere men and even angels who were being worshiped wrongly by others (see Acts 10:25\u201326; Revelation 19:9\u201310; 22:8\u20139). Moreover, we find some passages in Scripture revering Jesus in worship as Lord and where the names attributed to Him indicate that others believed He was divine - John 1:1\u20133, 14, 18; Acts 20:28; Philippians 2:5-8; Colossians 2:9; 1 Timothy 3:16; Titus 2:13; Hebrews 1:3, 8. Since the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb (Jesus) are the temple of heaven (Revelation 21:22), all the angelic beings are currently worshipping the Father and Son (Revelation 5:11\u201314; 7:9\u201310). Ultimately, all will worship Jesus someday; \u201cso that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father\u201d (Philippians 2:10\u201311).

            "answer_text": "Worship in Luke At the end of Luke\u2019s Gospel, right after Jesus ascends into heaven, we read: \u201cAnd they worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.\u201d (Luke 24:52) While this verse doesn\u2019t tell us much about the kind of worship/reverence that Jesus\u2019 disciples gave him, the larger context of the entire Gospel of Luke sheds some light on it. Specifically, Luke used this word only one other time in his entire Gospel: \u201c\u2019If you, then, will worship me, it shall all be yours.\u2019 And Jesus answered him, \u2018It is written,You shall worship the Lord your God,and him only shall you serve.\u2019\u201d (Luke 4:7-8) In this passage, the verb proskuneo (used twice and translated both times as \u201cworship\u201d) clearly refers to the adoration due to God alone. The devil is tempting Jesus in the wilderness, and he wants Jesus to worship him. In response, Jesus quotes a text from the Old Testament that tells us to worship God alone. As a result, when we go back to the end of the Gospel, there\u2019s a good chance that the verb has this same meaning there too. However, this is not decisive, so let\u2019s turn to the Acts of the Apostles, also written by Luke and intended to be the sequel to his Gospel, and see how he uses the verb there. Worship in Acts Just like in Luke\u2019s Gospel, all the instances of the verb proskuneo in Acts also refer to the adoration due to God alone (Acts 7:43, 8:27, 10:25, 24:11). For the most part, these four verses are pretty unremarkable, but there is one exception: \u201cWhen Peter entered, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped him. But Peter lifted him up, saying, \u2018Stand up; I too am a man.\u2019\u201d (Acts 10:25-26) In this passage, we see something very similar to what we read about in Satan\u2019s temptation of Jesus. Again, someone is tempted to worship a creature, and again, Luke tells us (through the mouth of one of the characters in the story) that we should not do this. At this point, we see a clear pattern. Not only does every other instance of this Greek word in Luke-Acts (the name scholars give to this two-volume work) refer to the adoration due to God alone, but Luke also tells us in both volumes that we are not to worship (proskuneo) any created beings. As a result, it\u2019s clear that for him, the word refers to the adoration due to God alone, not to the kind of reverence we can legitimately give to a mere creature. Consequently, when we turn back to the end of Luke\u2019s Gospel and see Jesus\u2019 disciples offering him this exact kind of worship, the implication is impossible to miss: Jesus is in fact God. The disciples gave him the adoration due to God alone, and they were not rebuked for this (unlike Satan and Cornelius). We have no other choice but to conclude that they believed him to be God, and Luke agreed. The Worship of Angels Let\u2019s turn now to the Letter to the Hebrews, which begins by contrasting Jesus with the angels to prove his superiority. Throughout the entire first chapter, the author quotes Old Testament texts about Jesus and the angels to make this point again and again, and one Old Testament quote in particular is very revealing: \u201cAnd again, when he brings the first-born into the world, he says,\u2018Let all God\u2019s angels worship him.\u2019\u201d (Hebrews 1:6) Again, the Greek word translated here as \u201cworship\u201d is proskuneo, so we need to examine this verse closely to see whether it refers to genuine adoration or to mere reverence. To do this, we first need to find its source; we need to see where in the Old Testament this comes from. When we do that, we find something interesting: the author doesn\u2019t seem to be quoting any single verse. Rather, it looks like he is drawing on two verses, Deuteronomy 32:43 and Psalm 97:7. Both of these passages have phrases that express this same general meaning, and the precise wording of the quote in Hebrews looks like a mix of both of them. While it may not be entirely clear in all English translations, in the original Greek some elements are taken from Deuteronomy 32:43, and some are from Psalm 97:7. Another interesting piece of this puzzle is that if you look up Deuteronomy 32:43 in your Bible, you probably won\u2019t find the phrase in question. It\u2019s not there in the Hebrew manuscripts of Deuteronomy that most English translations today are based on; rather, it comes from the Septuagint, the ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament used by Greek-speaking Jews and Christians in the first century. When we look at both of these passages in their original contexts, the object of this worship is clear as day. It\u2019s God. In both Deuteronomy 32:43 and Psalm 97:7, the authors are talking about God, so they are obviously referring to the adoration due to him alone. Consequently, when we turn back to Hebrews, the kind of worship the author had in mind becomes clear as well. By quoting two verses about the worship due to God alone and applying them to Jesus, he was unmistakably teaching that Jesus is to be worshiped as God. We Should Worship Jesus yes, we should worship Jesus. He is more than just a creature, so we should not give him the reverence due to other created beings. Rather, according to the New Testament, we should worship him just like we worship God, which leads us to one inevitable conclusion: Jesus is God. ",

            "answer_text": "No, he taught that we should pray to the only true God; his God and our God Prophets taught that there is only one true God Jesus taught us to pray to the only true God Scholars of each religion like to boast and claim that their prophet is the best prophet and that they have the only way for salvation Some scholars exaggerate more and claim that Jesus is the only son of God Some scholars exaggerate more and claim that Jesus is God But the fact is that Jesus denied his divinity: In Mark 10:18, Luke 18:18-19, Matthew 19:17, Jesus was asked: \u201cGood teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d Jesus Said: \u201cWhy do you call me good? No one is good\u2014except God alone\u201d. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments.\u201d There is no mention to the original sin, atonement, sin inheritance, salvation by faith alone, or accepting Jesus as savior, but inheriting eternal life by obedience. That is also confirmed in Luke 10:28 \u201cDo this and you will live.\u201d And in Luke 10:37 \u201cGo and do the same.\u201d Most churches boast about the miracles of Jesus. Jesus was not proud of miracles; he condemned those who asked him to show miracles in Matthew 12:39, Mark 8:12, and Luke 11:29 \u2018A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign!\u2019 Jesus did not claim to be a God, he did not ask the disciples to worship him as a God, he asked them to pray to the only true God (his God and their God). When the scribes wanted to support the doctrine of Trinity; they have added verses like 1 John 5:7 \u201cFor there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one\u201d The bible footnotes explain that verse 1 John 5:7 was not in the original old scriptures. The bible footnotes show many other additions in King James Version which were added to support the claims of trinity and which were not in the old scripture; examples are: In I John 4:3 \u2018CHRIST is come in the flesh\u2019 is an addition In Matthew 8:2, 9:18, 15:25, 18:26, 20:20, Mark 5:6 the word \u2018bow down' was changed to \u2018worshiped\u2019. Jesus referred to himself as \u201cson of man\u201d. Jesus was not all-knowledgeable and he prayed to GOD, so this is enough to say that he wasn\u2019t God nor did God come down to earth to be Jesus. Jesus said, \u201cAnd this is life eternal, that they might know You the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom You have sent.\u201d John 17:3 Jesus said that he does not know everything; he said that only God knows But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father Mark 13:32 Jesus said that he is not equal to God \u201cI can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.\u201d John 5:30 Jesus said, \u201cThe Father is greater than I.\u201d John 14:28 \u201cJesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.\u201d John 7:16 Jesus prayed to God as written in Mark 1:35, Luke 5:16, John 17:11, Matthew 26:39, Luke 10:21, Luke 22:44 \u201cmy Father and your Father; my God and your God\u201d John 20:17 The disciples did not pray to Jesus, they prayed to the God and Father of Jesus \u201cBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ\u2026\u201d 1 Peter 1:3 Jesus introduced himself as a Prophet and people accepted him as a prophet, not as a God in Matthew 13:57, John 9:17, Matthew 21:11, Luke 7:16, Luke 24:19, John 6:14, Matthew 14:5, Matthew 21:46, John 7:40-41, and in Matthew 24:36 In John 17:6-8 and John 13:3 Jesus explained that God has given power and authority, he did not own it John 12:49 For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say John 14:24 Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me In Matthew 19:16-17 and Luke 18:19 Jesus denied being good in the sense that God is good. \u2018Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.\u2019 Jesus is called a \u201cMan\u201d many times in the Bible of John 8:40, Acts 17:31, Matthew 27:54, Luke 23:47, Mark 15:39 \u2018a man who has told you the truth\u2019 The disciples have introduced Jesus as a \u201cMan\u201d in Acts 2:22 and Acts 2:23 Most churches do not teach the true teachings like Matthew 10:8 \u2018Freely you have received; freely give\u2019; they teach that it is o.k. to reap the financial gifts in exchange of the spiritual gifts and teach the attractive ones \u2018And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified\u2019 Romans 8:30 They try to make people feel happy by such attractive teachings in order to receive more donations. \u201cIf we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you?\u201d 1 Corinthians 9:11. most churches do not follow the strict teachings which urge us to obey God as taught by Jesus in Matthew 22:35-40, Luke 10:25-28, Mark 12:28-34, but they prefer the attractive teachings of Paul like \u2018We are saved by grace through faith apart from works\u2019 - Ephesians 2:8-9 \u2018Even when we were dead in sins, we are saved by grace\u2019 - Ephesians 2:5 \u2018A man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law\u2019 - Romans 3:28 \u2018A man is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith\u2019 - Galatians 2:16 \u2018For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse\u2019 - Galatians 3:10 Most churches do not follow the strict teachings like If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away which is taught by Jesus in Matthew 18:9, Matthew 5:29 and Mark 9:47, but they prefer the attractive teachings of Paul like: \u2018God has chosen us before the foundations of the world\u2019 - Ephesians 1:4 \u2018God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation\u2019 - 2 Thessalonians 2:13 \u2018For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation\u2019 - 1 Thessalonians 5:9 \u2018But let me reveal to you a wonderful secret. We will not all die, but we will all be transformed!\u2019 1 Corinthians 15:51 \u2018God has saved us and called us\u2019 - 2 Timothy 1:9 \u2018we have been justified through faith\u2019 - Romans 5:1, Romans 5:9  Most churches believe that Jesus death was necessary for the forgiveness of sins. But Jesus, like all other prophets, taught that we can earn salvation by obedience, repentance, and good deeds to help others. No sacrifice is necessary for salvation. No bloodshed is necessary for salvation. No savior should die for the salvation of others; everyone is responsible for his own salvation. Jesus has confirmed the same in Matthew 18:21-35, 6:14-15, Mark 11:25-26, Matthew 25:31-45, Luke 15:11-32 , and Luke 6:36-37 When the scribes wanted to support the doctrine of atonement, they have added verses like Matthew 18:11 For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost The bible footnotes explain that verse Matthew 18:11 was not in the original old scriptures Hebrews 9:22 \u201cwithout the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness\u201d is a misunderstanding of verse Leviticus 17:11 which is not about atonement but is about dietary laws. God has clarified that blood in meat is not good for health; that clarification was necessary to the people who did not have advanced medical tools to know that eating the meat with the blood still in it is bad for health The true word of God is not what is written by the unknown writer of Hebrews; it is what has been taught by Moses, Jesus and the Prophets who taught the forgiveness is possible by obedience, repentance, and prayers Proverbs 16:6 teaches that \u201cIn mercy and truth atonement is provided for iniquity.\u201d Psalm 69:30-31 teach that praise worship is better than sacrifice 2 Chronicles 7:14 teaches that forgiveness is obtainable without blood sacrifice \u2018If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves, and pray and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin\u2019 Jonah 3 teach that people are forgiven when they repented and fasted, without offering any sacrifice and without shedding any blood Proverbs 17:15 states: \u2018He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the righteous, both of them alike are an abomination unto God\u2019 That should be considered as a warning to the teachers who promise free salvation to the sinners and who teach that the innocent has been punished on behalf of the sinners Jesus taught the parable of The Prodigal Son in Luke 15:11-32 to highlight the importance of obedience and repentance as the main prerequisites for salvation That is the core Christianity teaching as taught in Matthew 7:21 Not every one that said to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that does the will of my Father which is in heaven Jesus has confirmed the teachings of the Old Testimony \u2018in repentance and obedience is your salvation\u2019 as taught in Isaiah 30:15 In Matthew 25:31-45 Jesus described the final judgment as being based on good works; he clarified that those who obey the law will be saved Salvation is not based solely on belief and nothing else; salvation is not granted to those who merely profess acceptance of Jesus without performing kind or compassionate deeds In Luke 13:3 and 13:5, Jesus taught that repentance is necessary for salvation But unless you repent, you too will all perish Mark 12:33 teaches: And to love one\u2019s neighbor as himself, is much more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices What Jesus taught here is not different from the wisdom taught by the old testimony Hosea 6:6 \u2018For I desire mercy and not sacrifice, And the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings\u2019 That verse teaches us that forgiveness is possible by repentance and obedience; no sacrifice is necessary Matthew 9:13 teaches that Jesus came to call the sinner to repentance \u2018I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance\u2019 The wrong teachings about original sin, atonement, and salvation by grace without obedience to God\u2019s law were taught by Paul who was not educated by Jesus. How can you validate my claims? The best advice is to ask God to guide us to the truth. The door is open for everyone to experience divine intervention The wise and merciful father keeps his door open for his children God has more wisdom and mercy than any wise merciful father People can communicate with God at any time Prophets of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have urged us to ask God and taught that God answers the prayers of the obedient believer. Example verses are: Psalm 107:28-30, Psalm 18:6, Psalm 145:18, 2 Chronicles 7:14, Isaiah 58:9 Matthew 7:7, Mark 11:24, Luke 6:27-28, James 4:2, Qur\u2019an 2:186, Qur\u2019an 40:60 Do not worry about how you will receive and understand the answer; God has created us and he knows how to convey his message to us. I have spent years wondering about what the purpose of life is. I have analyzed the teachings of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and prayed to God to guide me to the truth. I had some doubts about the teachings of a certain teacher, I have prayed to God to guide me to the truth I saw in a very clear dream that teacher in a form of a criminal prisoner, has committed evil, waiting for his trial. In another dream I saw a wolf hiding after attacking sheep; I understood that message as the bad teacher who try to mislead people by the bad teachings as Jesus explained in Matthew 7:15-20 \u201cBeware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves\u201d. I also remembered the Parable of the Weeds in which Jesus warned us about the enemy who insert false teachings into the scripture in Matthew 13:24-43 \u2018an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat\u2019 Pray and ask God to guide you about the teacher who claims that God does not exist; you will see him in a bad image Pray to God to know the truth about the teacher who teaches that Jesus is God Pray to God to know the truth about the teacher who claims that God tests us in this life and will reward us according to our obedience and good deeds Pray to God to know the truth about the teacher who taught original sin, atonement, salvation not based on obedience but taught free salvation by a savior to die for our sins Again, do not worry about how you will receive and understand the answer; God has created us and he knows how to convey his message to us. Isaiah 58:9 \u2018Then you will call, and God will answer; you will cry for help, and he will say: Here am I\u2019.

            "answer_text": "This is a good question, one that many don\u2019t think about. Whether Jesus claim to be God or not, he definitely never demand that we worship him. You see, knowing God through Christ isn\u2019t the same as Jesus want us to worship. Jesus want us to know Jehovah God and through him we are saved, all the authority is in his hands, yet we do not pray to Jesus but through Jesus. There a big difference. Time and time again Jesus rebuffed the attention and worship. He can be a God but not the GOD. I am not saying that we should not adore him and honor him, I merely state the fact in the bible that he did not ever demand our worship. In Fact he is adamant of insisting that we worship God the father! So in all sincerity we must not be too COLD or TOO HOT on this. We must be balance in our approach. Do what Jesus teach us to do. Know that we can\u2019t know God the father without Christ.Christ came from above, he existed before Christ human form.God Jehovah have honor and given all authority to his Son Jesus.God the father send Jesus down to die for our sins. Two distinctive person not one.We are to worship and pray to Jehovah and get to know him through Jesus Christ.Neither Jesus or Jehovah is unimportant, for both are very important both have a role to play in our lives. We should love and adore both. DO not fall into a trap and only accept one and reject the other.Suppose I elect my oldest perfect child to babysit. I also told his/her other sibling\u201d,listen to your older brother/sister, he/she have all the authority over you while I am not here\u201d. Now, I know this is a simple analogy but can you guess who is Jesus and who is Jehovah in this case?Jesus is Jehovah child, he is the oldest but he also worship God the father, Jesus though not 100% human are like our older brother, who God the father have given him full authority over mankind. He existed before his human form as we\u2019ve come know as Jesus. He was with the Father when to world was being created and all that it is in it. His desire that we can get to know Jehovah God just like he have pleasure of knowing God. The problem is sin have separate us from the Father and Jesus is our only savior. Only through him can we get to know the Father. Therefore God know Christ and Christ know him. We know Jesus and Jesus know us. God know us through Christ and we know God the father through Christ. It\u2019s like a chain of command. Jesus say the father is like the person watering the vine, Jesus is the vine and we are the leafs on the vine. If the vine died, we died. If we separate from the vine, we died. If the vine separate from the Father, the vine died, we all died. ",

In the first three gospels especially (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) Jesus occasionally demands loyalty and obedience, but MOSTLY in these Gospels, he says that it is our behavior, not our patterns of worship, that matter most to God\u2026 \u201cWhy do you say to me Lord, Lord! and not follow my commandments?\u201d \u201cNOT those who say to me, Lord, Lord! will enter the Kingdom of Heaven, but those that do the will of the father.\u201d Even in the Gospel of John, Jesus says some very interesting things at the Last Supper\u2026 First, he says that those who follow his commandments will be able to do all that he can do, and be his \u201cfriends\u201d (suggesting equality in my mind) rather than his \u201cdisciples.\u201d And then, immediately after, he says: \u201cI leave you just one commandment; that you love one another as I have loved you.\u201d My real point is this\u2026 The New Testament is all over the place and says all kinds of things \u2014 agreeing only that Jesus was a person who emphasized mercy, forgiveness, and compassion above following the letter of the law. But as to how much he demanded to be worshiped, you can find all kinds of different answers in the Bible itself. The Fundamentalists assume that it\u2019s all about worship, worship, worship \u2014 but I\u2019ve quoted some passages here that directly contradict that. ",

Jesus never claimed to be God, Jesus never claimed to be a deity Holy Quran - An-Nisaa 4:157 \u201cand in their statement that they murdered Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of God, when, in fact, they could not have murdered him or crucified him. They, in fact, murdered someone else by mistake. Even those who disputed (the question of whether or not Jesus was murdered) did not have a shred of evidence. All that they knew about it was mere conjecture. They certainly could not have murdered Jesus\u201d* Nowhere in the bible Jesus said he is God, he never claimed deity and he never said that people should worship him. Holy Quran -Al-Maaida 5:72 Those who say that Jesus, the son of Mary, is God, have, in fact, turned to disbelief. Jesus said to the israelites, \u201cWorship God, my Lord and yours. God will deprive anyone who considers anything equal to God of Paradise and his dwelling will be fire. The unjust people have no helpers. Holy Quran -Al-Maaida 5:116 \u201cWhen God asked Jesus, son of Mary: \u201cDid you tell men to consider you and your mother as their gods besides God?\u201d He replied: \u201cGlory be to you! How could I say what I have no right to say? Had I ever said it, You would have certainly know about it. You know what is in my soul, but I do not know what is in Yours. It is You who has absolute knowledge of the unseen.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Mostly this question is asked by Muslims. They pose questions like did Jesus say himself as God etc.,. Now, first of all, one has to experience Jesus personally to know his true identity. No can really know Jesus Christ as the true Lord unless they have some personal revelation. This can be by a healing, a solution to the problem, visions, dreams, etc.. We know the Newton\u2019s law of Action and Reaction. There are some feelings and responses in our life that they don\u2019t need to be taught but they come out as a reaction. For example, an infant cries not because someone taught it but it is the only way he know to communicate. Sometimes they smile not because someone taught it but it is the only way he know to express his joy. They are natural phenomenons. Many more examples can be cited using our daily life. Christians worship Jesus Christ because worship is the reaction when a person is touched by the divinity of the Jesus Christ. Prophets are not worshipped, angels refused to be worshipped but Jesus Christ accepted it. Angel\u2019s reaction to worship:At this I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, \"Don't do that! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers and sisters who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For it is the Spirit of prophecy who bears testimony to Jesus.\" -Revelation 19:10 2. Apostels reaction to worship: a) Paul and Barnabas: When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, \u201cThe gods have come down to us in human form!\u201d Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul they called Hermes because he was the chief speaker. The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought bulls and wreaths to the city gates because he and the crowd wanted to offer sacrifices to them. But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of this, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting: \u201cFriends, why are you doing this? We too are only human, like you. We are bringing you good news, telling you to turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heavens and the earth and the sea and everything in them. -Acts 14:11\u201315 b) Peter: As Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence. But Peter made him get up. \u201cStand up,\u201d he said, \u201cI am only a man myself.\u201d -Acts 10:25\u201326 3. Jesus Christ reaction to worship: Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, \u201cDo you believe in the Son of Man?\u201d \u201cWho is he, sir?\u201d the man asked. \u201cTell me so that I may believe in him.\u201d Jesus said, \u201cYou have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you.\u201d Then the man said, \u201cLord, I believe,\u201d and he worshiped him. -John 9: 35\u201338 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands, saying with a loud voice, \u201cWorthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing.\u201dAnd every created thing which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all things in them, I heard saying, \u201cTo Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, be blessing and honor and glory and dominion forever and ever.\u201d And the four living creatures kept saying, \u201cAmen.\u201d And the elders fell down and worshiped. -Revelation 5: 11\u201314 So worship is a proper reaction to Jesus Christ by a person when he is encountered by the presence of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is to be worshipped because of the fact that He is divine. ",

            "answer_text": "He told Phillip that He and the Father are the same God. He also accepted worship many times. The problem with saying Jesus is not God is two-fold. It totally robs Jesus of His place in the divine plan. That God came in the flesh for our salvation, and to assure us. It also puts humans back in the position of serving an impersonal, distant God- if you say Jesus was not God come to show us Himself. For Christians, we saw God when Jesus came. We saw the God we worship, and the kind of being He is. We no longer have to wonder if there\u2019s anyone even there listening to our prayers. Because we know Jesus- and Jesus is that God. Just look at Islam for example. They have five prayers a day, but they can\u2019t even tell you anything about the God they worship. Jesus wants us to know the God He is. That\u2019s why He became a man. He also did it to show humans our place in God\u2019s world. That we do carry the image of God. We are worth something. God made humans with the plan to one day manifest in our very nature- so He made us like Himself, except we\u2019re flesh. I can\u2019t tell you why God did this, or chose to do it that way. I\u2019m not Him. I can speculate that maybe God wanted to do it. God wanted to enter another nature of the flesh and become one with it. I mean is that idea so impossible? That\u2019s my speculation. All I can ultimately tell you is what it means for us Christians that God did things the way He did. So he chose a woman from the seed of David, who He prepared to be His vessel. He endowed Her with all graces and virtues, since she was going to be the way He came through into the human nature. Her flesh was going to be His flesh. Then God the Son became a man. ",

Some say Jesus became the right arm of our modern construction of our working God model. I suppose worshipping him in this posture is appropriate. Feels good. But of course it is only God that Christians have been taught by Jesus to have reverence for and worship as a pluralistic thanks giving. Jesus is many things to a mass of people who worship God. This is ok. Be sure to give him a second chance to becoming a meaningful mystery of humane salvation, like a homeless man who refuses to beg of you, but delivers to you all you can think would be helpful to give to him. He is Clothed by the Sun and addressed in imagination that comes surrounding. The cross of three tree streets bear our western Nazarene. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer, yes and no. Pre resurrection, Jesus redirects all praise to God The Father. Post resurrection, Jesus accepts the praise of others to be right and true. And here lies one of the many problems with Islam. Muslims do not believe that Jesus was killed on the cross (despite old testament prophecy and New Testament eye witnesses statements and blatant hints from Jesus), nor do they believe Jesus rose from death to life (again, despite all the testaments saying otherwise). They also do not believe Jesus is God in the flesh (despite Jesus saying \u201cBefore Abraham, I am\u201d, which led to his crucifixion for blasphemy). Thus they make Jesus out to be a liar, or The Bible to be untrue (they do not follow the New Testament either, so no New Covenant, no grace, no Good News). So, really, from a Muslim point of view, this question is a a bit pointless as they do not view Jesus as God in flesh, but more a prophet, like Moses. Do we worship prophets? Not at all. There are several points in The Bible post resurrection where Jesus accepts worship. ",

            "answer_text": "Did Jesus say that we should worship him? I give below my answer to a similar question before:- Who should Christians worship? Christians should worship exactly as Jesus advised them. As per Old Testament worship has to go to Holy Creator of universe, Yahweh. As per New Testament also worship has to go to Yahweh alone, the Father of Jesus Christ. However worship to Father has to be done in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, filled with Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Yahweh. Following verses explain it further. \u201cJohn 4:23\u201324 (ESV) 23 But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him. 24 God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.\u201d \u201c \u201cEphesians 5:18\u201321 (ESV) 18 And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but be filled with the Spirit, 19 addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart, 20 giving thanks always and for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, 21 submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.\u201d ",

When we worship who are we to worship? The scripture says we are to worship YhWh..(bible says Lord)! This word Lord is not a name, it is a title! When we look further, we see this is Ba'al! So when we reinsert the proper names and titles, Elohym instead of god, YhWh's name instead of LORD, we can clearly see The errors. Yhwhshua the namesake of YhWh, 23rd psalms, acts, etc., we see a clear seperation between YhWh Elohym and Yhwhshua the namesake and messenger of YhWh! YhWh is sovereign and his namesake sits at the Fathers right hand. When Yhwhshua Ya'meshiyah left he disnt go back to be YhWh! He went back to sit at YhWhs right hand! ",

Jesus also didn\u2019t stop those who did worship him. Do you remember his triumphal entry into Jerusalem? Multitudes praised and worshipped him as rode in on a donkey. But some of the religious leaders called out to Jesus, telling him to rebuke the crowd because they thought it was inappropriate. But Jesus replied, \u201cIf they kept quiet, the stones along the road would cry out!\u201d So not only did Jesus not stop people from worshipping him, he implied that he should be worshipped. ",

(Joh 5:17-18) But He answered them, \"My Father is working until now, and I Myself am working.\" For this reason therefore the Jews were seeking all the more to kill Him, because He not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.
