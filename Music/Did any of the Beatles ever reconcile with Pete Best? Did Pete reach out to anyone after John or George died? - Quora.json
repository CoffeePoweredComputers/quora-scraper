            "answer_text": "When Pete Best was fired, Brian Epstein offered Pete a job with an up and coming band in Liverpool\u2026.I think they were called the Merseybeats (sp?). Pete turned the job down. I\u2019ve read that Brian Epstein asked Pete to perform one more show with the Beatles, but Pete said no (I imagine it would have been extremely awkward [and I still find this difficult to believe]). At some point he went to work in a bakery. He is said to have attempted suicide a few years later (I thought this was around 1968, but I am not certain). To my knowledge, Pete never had any contact with any of the Fabs after his dismissal. Neil Aspinall knew the Beatles from an early age (at least Paul and George). I believe he was a roadie for them in the early days and eventually became the head of Apple. He also fathered a child with Mona Best (Pete\u2019s half-brother, Roag). When Aspinall died in 2008, I remember wondering if Pete Best and Paul McCartney might run into each other if there was to be a funeral or any kind of memorial service. Apparently there was a service, but Paul was represented by one of his daughters. I think Barbara Bach may have gone in Ringo\u2019s stead. There was a book that the three Best brothers wrote more than ten years ago (The Beatles: The True Beginnings) which anyone who is interested in this question might find extremely interesting. There is a Paul McCartney quote seen on the first page which reads \u201cI think it\u2019s a good idea to let people know about the Casbah. They know about the Cavern, they know about some of those things, but the Casbah was the place where all that started. We helped paint it and stuff. We looked upon it as our our personal club.\u201d When Ringo Starr was inducted into the rock \u2019n\u2019 roll hall of fame, Paul McCartney did briefly acknowledge Pete Best: \u201c\u2026.I mean Pete was great; and we had a great time with him but\u2026(and then Paul returns to the subject of Ringo Starr). I heard John bash Pete in an interview once. I don\u2019t know if it was the 1970 Rolling Stone interview, but if it was, I would not be surprised as John seemed to criticize a lot of people in that interview\u2026.including Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and George Martin. George Harrison once commented something along the lines that \u201cat least Ringo wasn\u2019t afraid to smile\u201d (though I\u2019m not sure in what context this remark was made). Pete probably wasn\u2019t too close with George, Paul, or John, so it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that there has never been any talk between Pete and any of the Beatles\u2026at least that I am aware of.

That being said, there may still be a little bit of bad blood. After all, Best did sue the Beatles in the 60s for defamation of character and settled out of court. He also still maintains he was sacked for reasons other than to do with his drumming proficiency and perhaps whilst he sticks to that narrative things remain a little awkward. Paul is very guarded but he did seem to let slip a remark to Howard Stern about Pete\u2019s jealousy, IF I recollect what he said in an interview a few years back. Legend has it that Paul called Pete during the Anthology period to let him know he\u2019d be getting some royalties and if he did do that I think that is basically as far as Paul\u2019s willing to go. Pete is simply not regarded as a Beatle person, rather someone who was just keeping Ringo\u2019s seat warm and though that seems unfair to many Beatle fans (myself included) we weren\u2019t there and don\u2019t really understand the dynamics.

He was a guy who owned a drum kit and could travel to Hamburg. That was literally his only qualificiation. He played in the group for two years and in that time he didn\u2019t really socialise with the rest of the group if he could help it. He joined them onstage but otherwise kept himself to himself and didn\u2019t mix with them. He was never their friend, he was always only their work colleague and he was the work colleague who held them back because he wasn\u2019t as good at his job as the rest of them. They pushed Pete out and he was resentful and annoyed but they were unrepentent. He was a bad drummer that they didn\u2019t get on with and was holding their career back. Within a few years he was a guy they used to know for a short period of time. They became much closer to other people in their circle during the intervening years and well and truly moved on. ",

He later sued for slander because of a interview Ringo gave to Playboy. Ringo said something about drugs. Pete sued for $18 million. Beatles settled out of court for far less. Although Pete and the Beatles had a stormy relationship after the firing, it\u2019s interesting to know that Pete\u2019s mom(Mona Best) kept in touch with them and would visit them when she came to town. In 1967 she showed a picture of her husband in his military uniform to John. John asked if he could borrow the medals for the cover of \u201cSgt Pepper\u201d. She gave them to him. Pete finally got his payday for his part in the Anthology albums. ",

I don\u2019t think any ever did personally, but Pete Best did finally get some payment for his Beatles service in 1995 when the Anthology 1 album came out with many tracks that featured Pete on drums. I\u2019ve read that his income from royalties on that album was in the millions, and I\u2019m happy for him. He had to wait 30 years, but he finally got in on some of the money. He seems like a good-natured fellow who\u2019s taken his rather unfortunate lot in life with a good deal of class. Best even used Twitter in 2020 to send happy 80th birthday wishes to his replacement, Ringo. That took class. ",

They were hired to go to Hamburg and they did not have a drummer an needed one. They knew of Best through his mother and that he had a kit so they asked him and he said yes. I believe it was just that they needed someone quick and knew of him and how many drummers would have just picked up everything and move to a different country for a few months? Seriously I think he was available and he was never portrayed as being a true friend of anyone in the band. John was the leader then and he loved Paul and Paul brought George into the mix and John brought Stu Sutcliffe on tour being seems John worshipped him but poor Pete Best was kind of dimwitted as he is always portrayed o don\u2019t think he ever had any dealing with the Beatles ever again. Best has made a good amount of money from early recordings so don\u2019t think he has much to complain about. ",

Keeping with the oddness around the Fabs, you know his mother was married to Neil Aspinall, roadie then personal assistant then President of Apple up until his death. So there was a way to connect. I once heard the individual Beatles\u2019 relationships with people that were jettisoned out of their lives described as one of \u201camnesiac finality\u201d. Some of them are dead of course, but I don\u2019t believe Paulie is on speaking terms with any of the ex-members of Wings either. ",

He also wasn\u2019t a very competent drummer. Just listen to how sloppy and unsteady he is on the recordings they made before Best was kicked out. They weren\u2019t going to make it with him on drums, and they did what they had to do. At least Best finally got some retirement funds thanks to Anthology, which should be all the thanks he needs.
