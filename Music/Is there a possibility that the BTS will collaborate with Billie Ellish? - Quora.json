            "answer_text": "Back in April, BTS told Beats 1 Radio that they loved Billie Eilish\u2019s album, \"When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?\" RM said that it was something everyone should hear and that Billie would actually be one of their dream collaborations. Not only has BTS said nice things about Billie, but in April Jungkook made a now-viral video dancing to Billie's \"Bad Guy.\" Duh\ud83d\ude1b pic.twitter.com/3lGmo7GpF6\u2014 \ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8 (@BTS_twt) June 9, 2019\n During an interview with NPR at the Austin City Limits festival the interviewer, Stephen Thompson, brought up the possibility of a collaboration with BTS. Eilish put the question to the crowd, but a few folks very adamantly said \"no.\" Billie Eilish appeared thrown off by that response: \"Stop! Oh my God, that is so mean,\" she told the audience at the taping, putting her hand over her mouth and looking wide-eyed and shocked. \"I'll listen to them. They've very nice, they've said some very nice things about me.\" When @billieeilish asked who she should work with...I said @bts_bighit because they like her alot....however the crowd was meh over it\ud83d\ude44 She said she'd listen to them! But if there's ever a collab between the two...\"You're Welcome\ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\" That was me! #btsartmy @aclfestival pic.twitter.com/nQFbc929kd\u2014 sanantoniostephanie (@Steph_In_Texas) October 6, 2019\n I think that some fans don\u2019t like the idea of a collaboration between the two artists because some people strongly believe in the \u201cstereotypical\u201d prejudices surrounding Kpop. This includes the idea that Kpop groups have \u201c12-year-old obsessive fans\u201d (which is 100% not true). I think that that stereotype began to arise when groups (including One Direction) were still active and somehow it has been applied to all boy groups, including Kpop groups. There are many other stereotypes, but I won\u2019t touch on all of them. Another reason may be because Billie Eilish and BTS give off entirely different vibes in terms of their personalities and music. Both artists are very genuine, humble, and kind, but Billie seems to be more liberal in her thoughts and in what she says to the public. This specifically accounts for her curse words and her controversial ideas. On the other side of the spectrum, BTS does curse, but they are very cautious about cursing/stating controversial opinions on camera. Both have also experimented in various genres of music, but their styles of music still seem to be very different for many fans. Some think that their styles of music won\u2019t clash well, while others think that it would e the next greatest hit! In my opinion, I would love to see this collab become a real thing. Billie Eilish and BTS are literally my all-time favorite artists, so I would be beyond excited to see both of my worlds collide!  ",
