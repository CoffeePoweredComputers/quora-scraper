            "answer_text": "You have a few alternative to find out.  1. Send the person a massage from a different number on viber and see if it shows \"seen\" under your massage. 2. If seen that means he/she has not turned her \"Send \"seen\" Statues\" off. Now you know that when you send him/her a massage from your number but it does not show \"seen\" but shows only \"delivered\" that means he/she has blocked you.3. You can also know that by his/her profile picture. If he/she has blocked you, you can only see her/his profile picture of the time when he/she blocked you and it never changes. Add her/him in another viber number and see what profile picture it shows there. That will show different one if he/she changes his/her profile.4. If he/she has blocked you, you giver him/her a call from viber and it shows \"Calling\" not \"Ringing\". :) good luck ",
