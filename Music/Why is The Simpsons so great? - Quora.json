            "answer_text": "The Simpsons has been a great show. It has stood the test of time, with ratings still flooding in for the newer seasons. However, your question is \u201cwhat made the Simpsons such a great show? The fact that nothing like it had been done before. Yes, The Flintstones and The Jetsons has been around for a long time before The Simpsons came along (as had many other similar shows). While this is true, those shows, and the others with similar dynamics, never showed a family with SUCH dysfunction. Homer, an abusive, alcoholic, loud mouth, who has no idea how to tell ten minutes into the future. However, on Homer\u2019s other side a caring, working-class father to three kids.Marge, a loving and slightly over-protective mother. Essentially, the glue that held the family together.Bart, the trouble-making, obnoxious kid with what seems like no moral compass whatsoever. Then you see episodes where he too, would do anything for his family.Lisa, the dorky, know-it-all little girl with no friends. One of, if not my favourite character from the entire show.Finally, Maggie, the homicidal, remorseless baby. Who shot a man because he tried to take her lollipop.It is this family dynamic that sets The Simpsons apart from every other show on TV. (In my opinion)The incredible amount of different stories that the creators have been able to tell. From Lisa having a crush on her substitute teacher, to Mr. Burns capturing the LOCH NESS MONSTER.The fact that the show has gone on so long, longer than any other animated TV Series. (To my knowledge)Finally (I could go on, but I want to keep this from becoming way too long), the abundant amount of theories that the fans have come up with. Homer in a Coma, The Be-Sharps royalties, and so many more, it gets the audience at home thinking and interacting with the show.To sum up, The Simpsons has been one of, if not the greatest TV shows of this generation. I hope it still has a few more good years. ",

            "answer_text": "In the 90\u2019s The Simpsons became somewhat of an American icon. I fell in love with those silly yellow people with the four fingers, and edgy dispossessions. I never really noticed as a kid the stereotypical role that each character possessed. All I knew was that this show was super edgy and really cool. I related to the show because of the dysfunction. Every family possesses some form of dysfunction, however this show was the first show of its kind to take this type of family dynamic and throw it out there for the public in cartoon form. Marge is the typical urban housewife. She is more of an enabler of her alcoholic, underachieving husband. She looks the other way when her husband and ADHD child Bart stirs up trouble. She holds a deep love for her family, but like my own mother, it is just easier for her to look the other way. Bart Simpson is a troubled youth that has a disciplinary file so big that it takes up several filing cabinet in the principal\u2019s office. He reminds me of my oldest Brother. Lisa is the brainy child in the show. She is depicted as a nerd with no real friends just because she is so smart. Maggie is the youngest, like me, she is not really heard or noticed unless it\u2019s feeding time. Their father, Homer is the safety inspector at the nuclear power plant. He often falls asleep at his work center in sector 7-G. He spends all his free time at a local bar called Moe\u2019s until it is time to drive home drunk. He is a crappy father with a drinking problem, and an IQ slightly above that of an ape. He reminds me of my other older brother. This show had an impact on me because of the family dynamic. It highlighted the fact that no family is perfect. It taught how situations can cause craziness in everyday life, and this can be considered normal. The children, no matter how bad, as in Bart's case, or good, as in Lisa's case, were both treated the same. Even though the parents did not spend much time giving them the attention they needed, they still knew they were loved and felt secure in that. This is how I was raised. I did not get a lot of attention growing up, but I knew my parents loved me. This show made me feel normal. This show might depict an all American stereotypical view that other countries may have about American life. God help us all if it does. ",
