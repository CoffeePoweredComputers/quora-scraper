            "answer_text": "Many variables. In general if there\u2019s an orchestra pit that\u2019s where they will be unless there is dramatic reason for someone to be somewhere else. But not all plays are performed in theatres and not all theatres have pits so there are a variety of possible options. Behind the action is one. Off to one side is another. Back in the very early days of opera before purpose built opera houses it was common to hide the musicians behind the scenery. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a lot of variables as to where the orchestra is placed. For most musicals and stage plays with incidental music they would be seated in the pit in front of and/or under the stage. Some stage directors will place a small orchestra up stage behind a scrim so they are not seen. Other productions may make the players an integral part of the play. The may be down stage and visible to the audience and even interact with the cast. ",
