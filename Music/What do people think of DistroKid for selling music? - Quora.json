            "answer_text": "I recently released a CD and was going to go with TuneCore, which seems like a similar idea, but it was pointed out to me that if I went with CD Baby, I would also have efficient distribution of physical CDs, so I went with them.  They put your music on most digital-sales services and you have the option to distribute to Pandora and other streaming services as well. ",

            "answer_text": "But why share the revenue at all which would be fractional if you\u2019re not among the most popular artists? Just set up your own website with a PayPal cart or Patreon donations. You\u2019ll need the money to pay for the website\u2019s running costs, haha. Physical CDs? Burn & send them out yourself. You\u2019ll be able to connect with fans this way as I don\u2019t think Apple gives you the customer\u2019s details when you sell a track/album. ",
