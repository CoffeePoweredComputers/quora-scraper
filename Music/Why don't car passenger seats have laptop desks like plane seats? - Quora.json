            "answer_text": "For several reasons that really should be obvious: There is little demand. Very few people have adult passengers in their backseat regularly, and of those people, very few are in the car long enough to justify getting out a laptop and using it. Today\u2019s mobile computing is more likely to be done on tablets and phones.Tray tables are an injury risk during an accident. They block side and pillar airbag deployment, not to mention you could be throw into one hard enough to shatter your rib cage.They add additional expense to the design and manufacturing of the vehicle. It may not seem like much, but the market is highly competitive and every little bit counts.So there you are - people don\u2019t want them, few people would use them, they present a safety hazard and they\u2019re an extra cost. That\u2019s a lot of negative for very little positive. It\u2019s worth noting that a few ultra-luxury cars like Rolls-Royce do, in fact, have tray table for the rear seats. That is because these vehicles are designed to be driven by a chauffeur, and it is assumed that the passenger will conduct business in the car. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably due to different safety issues, with the table during an accident. But, when the designs of of passenger seats in cars was under scrutiny following the publication of \u2018unsafe at any speed\u2019. But this question does not address the question \u201cpassenger seat of what?\u201d. It could be a bus? A Train? But most likely a car. During the \u2018safety testing of seating\u2019, phase of Car Accident analysis, then the engineers would have discovered the hazards of the seating styles. The \u201creverse door design\u201d was eliminated following these tests. But, during these years, there was no device such as a \u201claptop computer\u201d. This eliminates the possibility that there was accommodations for a device that does not exist. It will not be possible until many years later, designs would be proposed for concept vehicles with laptop tables to be included in car/bus/train designs. ",
