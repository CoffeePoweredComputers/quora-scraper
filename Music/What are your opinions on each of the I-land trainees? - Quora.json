            "answer_text": "My favorites so far are: Jake- this boy just has something special. He trained for only a few months but he\u2019s doing great already. He may have blew up for his visuals, but he\u2019s got potential to become better at singing and dancing. Overall, he seems like a sweet and hardworking boy.Daniel- overall a very considerate and lively boy. His audition was good, but more than his talent his warm personality sticks out to me. He is only a 2006 liner and he\u2019s that amazing already.Heesung- potential to be a great leader for I-Land. He is really popular among the bighit trainees for his talent. He\u2019s a great dancer and good mentor. He will make it far along with Sunghoon by his side.Sunghoon- his visuals are what korea seeks for. He also has a lot of star factor considering he\u2019s popular even before coming to the show for his figure skating. I think he\u2019ll debut for sure.Hanbin- he was dropped out too soon and it\u2019s unfair. I liked his rap the most from the auditions. Even being in ground, he\u2019s been so productive and positive after making new friends. Fighting!Jungwon- first impression was that he is really cute. Later I found out from Episode 2 that he has possibility of being the next trendy vocal in kpop. His voice sounds similar to TXT Yeonjun when he sings.Taki- similar to Daniel, he really just radiates the positive energy. He\u2019s very good at dancing and he is passionate about what he does. I like him a lot especially how he is so kind to others.Honorable mentions: Jay and Sunoo ",

            "answer_text": "Im just gonna pick on my faves so far HEESUNG - i love him . He is talented , he have the aura and im.on being stage alone it doesnt look awkward much . He is vically stable and a very good leader but can be harsh sometimes and thats what i think he need to improve since nit everyone can follow they way he does things. TA-KI - he is my seperate twins. we born on the same day and same year yeah im delusional. anyway , tbh he is very cute . him in the ground isnt something u can argue because hus performence is average comapre to others. But he got potential and i believe he can debut. JAY - omg i just love that he dont give up on trying despite being rejected everytime. he didnt really catch my eye in the evaluation performences but i like his personality SUNGHOON - he is one of the contestants that i look foward to. he didnt impress me much in the evaluation test but he got a good heart and care for heesung when others dont. JUNGWON - he got insanley good vocals i mean his part was just soo soothing and his voice is just damn good. Plus he is very stable too. Honourable mention : hanbin , sunoo , daniel , jaebeom , youngbin , nicholas ",
