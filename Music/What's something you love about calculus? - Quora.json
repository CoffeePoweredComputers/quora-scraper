            "answer_text": "As an average student, I learned well in Calculus because I was lucky enough as both of my professors in two semesters were so good yet soooo strict. I took the course while I was a working student that time - school in the morning, then work at night in graveyard shifts - and I couldn't help but to study very hard, because I was so afraid of failing. When I finished those \u2018deadly\u2019 semesters, my love in the subject went on and on. I continued to read several textbooks and made a compilation of solved complex problems. In my higher years, when I couldn't remember an engineering formula, I simply derived it using Calculus which has made some of my professors impressed with my solutions. Because of that - even I wasn't qualified - my professor endorsed me to become one of the Math tutors in our school, so I had an opportunity to help my friends and even the students in lower years who were struggling in the subject. My group of friends grew in a hundred. Majority of them are already engineers by now, doing well in their careers and the good thing is, we're still friends. Isn't it worth learning? ",
