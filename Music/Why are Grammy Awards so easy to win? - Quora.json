            "answer_text": "To start, I will disagree with you because if winning Grammy Awards were as easy as you claim, many amazing artists like Mya would have won tons of them. Now, I will answer why it \u201cseems\u201d Grammy Awards are so easy to win. To start, the Grammys aren\u2019t fan decided. They are decided by a panel of board members who pick winners based on a set of criteria given by the head organization. The general public likely doesn\u2019t know what that set of criteria is. They just know the nominees when said nominees are picked by the board members. To the average fan, it seems that the most popular artist gets the award. However, it goes way deeper than that as if it didn\u2019t, more amazing singers and rappers would have won multiple Grammy awards than the same well known artists seemingly every time. ",

            "answer_text": "Uh, they\u2019re not. Did you not hear about the Recording Academy scandal involving former CEO Deborah Dugan? She spilled that the Grammys are rigged. So many deserving artists got screwed out of awards for over a decade (remember Mariah Carey\u2019s losses?). While a lot of great artists got their awards (Michael, Prince, Whitney, Celine, etc.), the Grammys are at their core, inauthentic. If anything it\u2019s even more of a crapshoot to get one. The recent proof? Billie Eilish sweeping all of those awards at the last ceremony (no offense to Billie, this is an institutional problem and she recognized it that very night). ",
