            "answer_text": "Genres simply start with either some musician mixing the features of some other genres or group of musicians that \u201cget angry\u201d with a specific genre. What do I mean by getting angry? In the late 30s, swing genre became a huge industry that supplies the demand for \u201ceasily listenable jazz\u201d, lots of records that were copies of each other made, just like today's pop. So bunch of musicians came together against this in Kansas City, in Harlem and lots of other places and then, a new genre (or style you may say) was born: Bebop! But the point is that the musicians didn't come together to create a new genre, didn't say something like \u201chmm, let's do something new and call it bebop\u201d, it was just what that's came out of their instruments. Or \u201cshoegaze\u201d that came out in 90s, no band claimed that they created a new genre, they were doing alternative rock with lots of pedals and so on, looking at the ground, at their pedals in their concerts. So, NME and some other magazines mocked this situation and called them \u201cshoegazer\u201d, this was how the new genre was born, in theory. Death metal is a good example as well. When the band Death came out with their music that combines the technic side of thrash metal and the elements of hard-core with philosophical; cynical and nihilist lyrics, some other bands followed their path too. Afterwards, the music they make is named as \u201cDeath Metal\u201d, after the band Death. But Chuck Schuldiner, the lead guitarist and singer of Death, wasn't happy about being called as the creator of this new genre, he was saying that \u201cIt's just metal!\u201d. As you can see, new genres generally came out after musicians mix the elements of other genres and combine them with specific themes (not always, but Psychedelic rock can be an example of this). But although the music is there, it's not counted as a new genre until someone, generally historians or magazines, label them with new shinny names. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A... It's a great question, and a difficult one to answer. But consider this, new genres of music are being invented all of the time. By the time you've read this answer, at least one new genre of metal will have been birthed. Genres are awkward things to define, even as they're happening. Often, you'll find certain acts that can't be placed simply because they don't stick to any particular genre. But, I imagine that you're thinking in broad strokes, such as pop, metal, jazz, blues, etc. The truth is that there probably won't be any new broad genres coming along any time soon. But the micro-genres will continue to evolve into new blends of completely different things. I can take the way that house music blended with techno and birthed trance and other electronic genres in the 90s, and then pop got in on the act, and now most modern pop music blends elements of electronic music with a little rock, and we have something completely new. That's the kind of evolution I'm talking about here. In general, and I look to history to be sure of what I'm saying, there are two possibilities for new genres. Either some new genres will emerge that increases the complexity of what we generally hear today, or music will devolve to an extent that minimalistic compositions will be the order of the day. Some of these things have slipped by on the sidelines already. Math Rock, which uses algorithmic dynamics, has seen some popularity in recent years. Some of the newer metal genres have seen a devotion to the skill of very precise guitar techniques and playing. Broadly speaking, and not just necessarily regarding the emergence of new genres, here are my predictions for the next decade... Music in most genres, especially that of popular music, will increase in complexity.Casual listeners, ever more tired with the same old pop music, will seek out newer pastures and bring them to a wider audience. Listeners' ability to comprehend and enjoy complex music will increase greatly.There will be more attention paid to how music is performed and produced. We've seen a huge increase in home hobbyists and bedroom productions. Production is the next phase in that equation, and more people will be learning how to do just that.Classical and contemporary music will flourish artistically. Some minor genres may become more prominent, while others may see a resurgence.There will be a continual increase of highly-competent composers and performers in many genres.  It will become increasingly common for top composers and performers to move freely among multiple genres.The connoisseurship of music will become widespread and even mainstream to a degree. Music snobbery won't just be for the music snobs any longer.",
