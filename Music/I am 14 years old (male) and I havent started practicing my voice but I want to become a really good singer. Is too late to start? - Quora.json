I started singing when I was 16 in a choir. Use any opportunity to sing and to learn. However, the fastest and most effective method is to find a teacher. I \u201clost\u201d many years in various choirs and significantly improved my singing only after I found a teacher (and I was 55 then). To make myself clear, singing in choirs and small groups is excellent but should be combined with lessons by a qualified teacher. ",

            "answer_text": "It is not late to start voice lessons at age of 14; it was a time when I started private lessons. Usually kids sing in choir till their High School; and then my dad found me a very good teacher that have sung in operatic choir. It is just a right age to start lessons b/c your voice only starts to develop fully when you are 18 years old; if you are 14 you may still go through changes in your voice; sing with care and find a good teacher.
