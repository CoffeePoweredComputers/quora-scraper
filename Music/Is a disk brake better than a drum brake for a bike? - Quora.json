            "answer_text": "You\u2019ve got a lot of answers here that have explained how these things work, so I\u2019m not going to get into that. Instead, I\u2019m only going to explain why disc brakes are better. Bear with me, it might meander a bit but there\u2019s a point to it. Everything in your vehicle is transfer of energy. There is chemical energy in the fuel, that gets burned and gets converted into heat energy. This heat energy is either given out to the atmosphere (or the rider\u2019s butt, in the case of Harley Davidson and Ducati), or is used to drive the piston, which is converted into mechanical energy. When your bike moves, it converts that mechanical energy into kinetic energy. When you want to stop, that kinetic energy has to go somewhere - energy can neither be created nor destroyed, remember? It can only be converted from one form to another. So what brakes do is convert the kinetic energy of your moving vehicle and passengers into heat energy, via the friction between pad and disc. If you\u2019ve got this far, congratulations - we\u2019re done with the concept of the brake. Now to why disc brakes work better. The disc is out in the air and can therefore exchange heat more easily with the atmosphere. A larger surface area is also exposed - that\u2019s both sides of the disc, plus the holes that are drilled and the slots that are cut into it don\u2019t just cut weight; they also add to the surface area. You\u2019ll get a lot of feedback about how disc brakes are not good in low grip conditions and they have a very sudden progression; more often than not rider education can take care of a lot of problems. If the test riders kept falling all the time under braking while the bike was being developed, would the manufacturer really still put that part into production?The only area where I can think drums can be better than discs on a motorcycle are in the unlikely event of some lubricant splashing on the brake assembly. Since the disc is open, that can be dangerous. But in all my years of riding things with disc brakes, the only time this was a concern was when the person who serviced my bicycle polished my bicycle brakes discs with oil. Luckily for me, I took that test ride in a crowded area, so didn\u2019t get up to speed before I had to use the brakes! ",
