            "answer_text": "Probably because pentatonics are easy to remember and play on guitar. Guitar is the most iconic and widely learned rock instrument, and it\u2019s a combination of the right notes, being laid out in an easy to use, and easy to learn pattern, that makes guitars and pentatonic scales work so naturally together. Furthermore, the minor pentatonic scale contains all the importan notes of the blues scale, and since rock n roll was built from the foundation of the blues, that tonality is still valid in rock music. Certainly any scale can be played on any chromatic instrument, but the nature of the guitar fretboard makes it easy to see and recall scale patterns visually and tactilely. If you learn a scale in one key, you simply move the same physical pattern to another starting point to change keys. For most other instruments, you need to learn different fingering patterns for each scale in each key, not so on the guitar (guitar does have its own unique challenges, but it is uniquely set up to be a natural fit for visual/pattern learners). So essentially, if you know one scale on guitar, you instantly know it in all keys. Pentatonic scales only have 5 notes per octave, so they\u2019re less complex than typical 7 note major and minor scales to begin with, further aiding in being able to learn them quickly. Beyond just being an easy pattern to learn and transpose on guitar, the way the minor pentatonic scale is laid out, you can simply play one minor pentatonic scale, and it fits over almost any entire blues or rock chord progression. This is the case with any instrument, not just guitar. If you\u2019re playing a rock or blues tune in the key of A major, you can generally just learn the the A minor pentatonic scale (that\u2019s not a typo, minor pentatonics are used even in major keys, creating a blues tonality), and it will fit over ALL the chords in the entire song. It\u2019s too technical to bother to try to write out why this is, it\u2019s much more easily taught by demonstration. Suffice it to say, for most rock songs, the minor pentatonic scale, started from the tonic note, contains almost all the useful notes you need to play solos or fills, over all of the chords in the song.

            "answer_text": "If I need to describe the reasons it will be as follows: It's easy to remember and play songs in pentatonic scale. If you see throughout the history rock musicians don't use sheet music on stage. They play songs from their memory, and since songs written in pentatonic scale are easy to remember they tend to use that scale quite often.It's one of the most versatile scale out there and it tends to sound good in most musical compositions.The thing about most early rock and roll bands is that they indulged themselves less in technical virtuosity and more into energetic performances. The simplicity and versatility of pentatonic scale makes it work great in that context.Third reason has to do with the origins of rock music. It evolved from blues and rockabilly. Almost all blues and rockabilly songs are based on the pentatonic scale, this trait of theirs was carried over to rock music.Not to forget the fact that many of the earliest rock and roll musicians came from blues and rockabilly background. So it's pretty obvious that they carried over the traits of those genres into rock and roll.",
