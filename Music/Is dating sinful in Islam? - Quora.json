            "answer_text": "Thank you for the request. Starting with a verse from Quran: This day [all] good foods have been made lawful, and the food of those who were given the Scripture is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them. (And [lawful in marriage are] chaste women from among the believers and chaste women from among those who were given the Scripture before you, when you have given them their due compensation, desiring chastity, not unlawful sexual intercourse or taking [secret] lovers. And whoever denies the faith - his work has become worthless, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers) (Quran 5:5) Dating, as it is common now, means finding a life partner by spending much time with them to know them better, and make a decision of marrying them. You are a Muslim and you might like someone. And you want to know them better. Nothing wrong with that. It would be better if you tell them this directly, or give them hints about that, so that they would know about your intentions. But all the meet-ups, dinners, hang-outs, It would be better if you stay away from all these. Because all these hanging out around, with a Non-Mehram, is not allowed in Islam, because Indeed when a boy and and a girl are alone, Shaitan is the third with them. Even if you get a positive reply from them, You both are not the only ones to make this decision. Inform your parents as soon as possible of your decision. If your parents think they are suitable for you, your parents will talk to the other\u2019s parents. If your parents refuse, convince them, with all due respect. Do not take all the decisions yourself. After both the parents agree, and find that you both are suitable for each other, and make a commitment with each other, which is commonly knows as \u201cEngagement\u201d. This time between the engagement and \u201cNikaah\u201d should be used to know the other better. You can talk on phones and social media in this age for example, while staying in the limits of modesty. If during this time you feel like you both are not suitable, you can break the engagement. No need to think about society and other stuff. So instead of taking the risk of falling into sin by hanging out around alone with a person of opposite gender, gain the confidence of your parents, and then know them better, and avoid staying alone with them much. So getting to know your life partner before your marriage is not only allowed, but it is encouraged to do so. You can also gather information about your partner from their relatives, friends, family neighbours etc. too. But stay in the limits of modesty and Islam. Hope I helped :)! ",

            "answer_text": "It isn\u2019t. Only sinful things in Islam are public fornication, be it cheating of your spouse or fiancee, or just raving in the street if you\u2019re single. Other things that are sinful are murder and harming other, and yourself. Harming in any way, be it cheating, deceiving, lying, stealing, torturing them or their beloved ones, torturing animals, plants, the planet. Literally, these are sins. It is not a sin to: write, read, (digital or paper), watch TV, play video games, play other games, sports, eating, dressing up, swimming, driving a car, working (unless it\u2019s to cheat somebody) sitting, sleeping, looking, having eyes closed\u2026 ",
