            "answer_text": "the people who buy singles and the people who buy album may not be the same. Radios often only play singles. When I was younger I mostly got the music I liked from radio and those were only the singles so that I would notice a new track released when it came on the radio because I never bought albums. At that time I also bought 12\u2033 singles occasionally. Later I started buying albums (CDs actually) and only bought some singles when they were special remixes on CD. Today, buying a complete albums is not necessary and singles are not as important, but the radio airplay thing is still happening. ",
