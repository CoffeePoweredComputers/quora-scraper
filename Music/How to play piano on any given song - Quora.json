            "answer_text": "Having an ear to be able to play music from simply hearing it is truly a gift, and one we want to nurture in our children. But it also can be problematic when it prevents students from learning their music fundamentals. I think piano is easy to learn, but incredibly difficult to master. Anyone can learn to pick out a few chords and melodies, and it won't take long. Playing an easy piano song or two is far from un-achievable. Having finesse on the keys is a whole other ballgame.

I personally insist on the reading of Staff Notation (because I'm an educator!); however, one of my pupils showed me how some Songs show a keyboard which highlights where the fingers should go. Of course, there is always the option of trying to pick a Song out by ear, in which case you will need to break it down  by  stages. ",
