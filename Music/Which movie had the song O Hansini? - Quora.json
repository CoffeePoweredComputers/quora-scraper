This one song is the only thing that is remembered from the movie, which has otherwise been forgotten. Movie: This song appears in the 1974 movie Zehreela Insaan (Poisonous Man) produced by Virendra Sinha and directed by Puttanna Kanagal. The movie starred Rishi Kapoor, Moushmi Chatterjee, Neetu Singh, late Pran, late Nirupa Roy, late Iftekhar, late Manorama, late Madan Puri and Paintal. It is remade from the KannadaNaagarahaavu (1972). Both the language versions were based on a novel by the legendary Kannada writer T R Subba Rao (Ta Ra Su). The Hindi version was extensively shot in the Karnataka\u2019s Chitradurga Fort. ",
