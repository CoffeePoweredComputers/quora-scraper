            "answer_text": "I believe that Benzin can be understood in basically three ways: This is a song about pyromaniac\u2019s love for petrol and fire. This is the most explicit and obvious meaning. Petrol is his or her substitute of a drug. Instead of smoking or drinking, a pyromaniac feels the urge to burn things.There is possibly a political interpretation referring to the U.S. politics and taking paraffin/kerosene from the Middle East. I heard that one somewhere but I don\u2019t recall the details.The other day I thought that there is a less violent way of understanding the lyrics. It may be about a person who just\u2026 loves driving cars. Petrol, preferably \u201cwith a lot of octan and lead-free\u201d, is in this case needed in a car for ignition. \u201cHeart and kidneys are my motors\u201d, he says.",

            "answer_text": "Benzin means gasoline. Basically the song is about burning things down. The narrator says he neither wants/needs drugs (cocaine, alcohol, coffeine) as help in his life, nor friends, medicine or women. The only thing he needs is fuel, kerosine, nitroglycerin. He needs this, because he believes: \u201cWillst du dich von etwas trennen, dann musst du es verbrennen. Willst du es nie woeder sehen. Lass es schwimmen in Benzin.\u201d (If you want to get rid of something, you must burn it. If you never want to see it again, let it swim in gasoline.) It is not specified what exactly he wants to get rid of. Funny side information: Till Lindemann wanted to make a song about gasoline because he liked the word \u2018Benzin\u2019. ",
