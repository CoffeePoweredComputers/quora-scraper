            "answer_text": " Dance is not merely body movement- it is like poetry in motion as someone said. With thoughts, emotions, expressions and elegant movements, it brings alive the meaning. Dance is an art from which is done with body, mind and soul. A dance done by our body alone is incomplete- it has to have the right expressions and involvement of the dancer. his/ her inner self. Dance must be done with lot of passion, for it to bring out the beauty of the music or song. From the hunting dances- depicting the prey and hunting scene, during the cavemen time, to the present day fusion or modem dance, dances have evolved in every culture in east and west. Dances generally are rhythmic, repetitive with slow movements or fast movements maintaining co-ordination between the music, steps, expression and grace. Though any person who likes music may dance a little or use steps according to the rhythm. very few people bring out the expression of emotion involved. So, anyone can dance but not all are good dancers though. The dances which are performed for an audience are mostly traditional and presented after practice. To understand the minutest detail of expression in these dances one must know the meanings of various symbols or \u2018mudras\u2019 showed by the dancers. Where as in the informal or dances which are just done for pleasure or entertainment, rigid rules or steps are no followed. It\u2019s more adaptable, spontaneous and less complicated in expression. The informal dance that is dances which are set to light music, fast rhythmic beats or popular film music because of its simple nature are liked by present generations as against the traditional and complicated classical types. One is a pure art at higher level and the other is art which appeals to the common man. All the different expressions of joy, fun, anger, sorrow, surprise, love or hate can be expressed in the pure dance forms, with great grace. The same emotions of life can be expressed in today\u2019s dance but in simple ways. The importance has shifted from showing right expressions gracefully to the feel \u2018nice or good\u2019 of dancing. Today, dancing is not just an art but an outlet to release our fears & enjoy and feel good about ourselves. Dance has been and is an expression of different phases of life. It is performed during birth, initiation into adulthood, marriage or even death (in some communities). It\u2019s performed to express our devotion to gods, please the gods & invoke the gods in different cultures. No one teaches little toddlers to dance but generally we find children attracted to the rhythms and start to move their hands, legs, body or head! They do it before even learning to speak meaningful words. That\u2019s the way they express joy probably. Its quality of lifting one\u2019s sprits, making us a little more confident, expressive in our feelings and general \u2018feel good\u2019 factor makes it more attractive to people, today. We find more and more people taking to dancing. The serious ones go for the traditional type and the people who want enjoy go for the simple modern ones. Some dance when they are happy, some when they are sad and some when they are disturbed or angry (just like lord Shiva who performed the \u2018thandav\u2019). Indeed, dance is an expression of life whether learnt and done or spontaneously done.  ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A Can you describe a very beautiful dance in words? I\u2019m not entirely sure what is being asked here, however. It could be taken as: Is it possible for someone (or just me) TO describe a beautiful dance briefly, clearly and lively. Using words that evoke that kind of thought or emotion. The answer is yes, though I am hardly the best at using words to evoke such easily. (In my opinion)Is there a dance in particular that I can think of, that I could describe as such. Again, possible. I don\u2019t have any in mind, though being familiar with dance overall, I could attempt to do so.Of course, then there\u2019s the matter of subjective beauty. I may think that some breakdancing is beautiful, or ballet.. .While most consider beautiful, and while I can appreciate the skill\u2026 generally bores the **** out of me. While I can obviously \u2018write\u2019. I do not consider myself a \u2018writer\u2019 as such, and am prone to writer\u2019s block, so for me to write up one, I\u2019d likely need a focal point of a particular dance, or at last style of dance first.

            "answer_text": "It was silent. The world seemed empty, the people frozen for a moment, abandoning thought for experience, for the entertainment of watching the brilliance of the product of a master's mind. Then the music started. Colours floating in and out of focus, existing but not enough to reflect on the audience\u2019s eyes, but the performers seemed to share my sight of the sounds. They wove and turned, perfectly matched to the purples and golds surrounding us. Their motion created a song of it\u2019s own, the sound of their dance painting a masterpiece of sound on the canvas already claimed by the colour of the music. Chasing and weaving, not forgetting the power of a frozen pose, the story told in every silence. Then they stopped. And the music stoped and we all held our breath, caugth by the power of nothingness. Caught like a deer in the headlights, for just a second as their brains processed what they had just witnessed and experienced. Then the room burst full of sound and colour, but this time the unsteady battle to be heard of fifty people sharing opinions exitedly in the languages I have grown to love. The sound of life. ",
