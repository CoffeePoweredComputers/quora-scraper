            "answer_text": "Okay, before getting into electronic music production, you need to know about music. Keep aside electronic music for now. Take up a piano course, learn the music theory. This might take you anywhere from a few months to years? But you have to wait. Then learn about sound design and elements of a track. By this time, you should have bought a DAW or digital audio workstation or would have got it somehow which is not fair. Then by time, you will get good at mixing and other things essential. Make connections with other producers who know their stuff and ask them for advice. Take it all in and make a decent song. After that, think about branding and marketing and socials. Get yourself a cool logo and a cool name, and make a soundcloud page, and focus on your branding. Make it look professional. At this point of time, you should be really decent in making music and your first release should probably the 30th or the 50th track you created and this would be around 1 year later. Or, you can release all those 50 tracks you made only to delete your alias and create a new one. Now, you can do 2 things. Send your OUTSTANDING song to a big record label, maybe Monstercat or NCS or so many more, possibly depending on the genre you create. Your professional EDM career will start then.ORYou can self-release your song and send it over to a big promotion company like Proximity or xKito music\u2026 It might not fetch you so much money that a record label can, but it will sure as hell give you exposure.There is so much to music production tat you will learn eventually.You need to invest on stuff. Music doesn\u2019t come in cheap. At lease a decent pair of headphones like Audiotechnica or something.And most importantly, you need to be patient.:) ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, There are five stages of an electronic music producer: InitiationExponential LearningThe DipProficiencyMasteryHowever, not everybody can effectively manage all the steps that lead to a good EDM song and choosing a good production studio is always a good idea. Therefore, I really recommend Supreme Tracks since our professional team members have a lot of experience and EDM is in their field of expertise. We managed to produce many successful EDM tracks - you can find some of our case studies on our Blog (EDM Song Production Services [Client Case Study]). As for the above mentioned stages, if you are keen on trying to produce your EDM track on your own, here are my advice: Stage 1: Initiation Firstly, you should choose and learn your DAW: Ableton Live, FL Studio, Cubase, and Logic Pro. My advice is not to thing to much if you\u2019ve made a good choice since that decision will take too long and your priorities will be way out of line. Just pick a one and start working with it, you can change the DAW later if you really have the need (but I am sure that won\u2019t be the case). Other gear that you need are: a pair of headphones or computer speakers . Yes, better equipment will certainly be helpful, however you don\u2019t need it at the beginning. A MIDI keyboard is also a plus if you have the budget. After downloading a DAW, your focus should be to learn how to use it properly. The best way to do this is to read your DAW\u2019s manual (you won\u2019t believe how many people don\u2019t do it or to watch a Youtube tutorial. Now it is time to play! At this stage, your only goal should be to play and more importantly- to experiment. Learn how to recreate a melody that you created in your head and make it even more interesting. Have fun! Create your first song - you are ready now. Yes, you are now able to do it from start to finish! Stage 2: Exponential Learning This stage lasts 1\u20132 years and you will develop skills acquire knowledge, improve as a producer at exponential speed. Here\u2019s an graph that I found recently that shows the learning curve:  In this stage there are 4 key disciplines you should learn: Learning the fundamentals, create a huge volume of work, experiment with as many different genres as you can and gathering feedback and build relationships. Stage 3: The Dip The first thing you must do if you find yourself in \u201cthe dip\u201d is learn to deal with the feeling of overwhelm. Afterwards, you should figure out your objective and motivation and learn how to overcome creative problems. Stage 4: Proficiency In this stage, again, there are several key disciplines you should develop: Advanced learning and remakingCollaborationChose your career pathYes, even if music is your side-job you can still reach stage 5 producing music, but it won\u2019t be easy. Stage 5: Mastery This is a stage that very few people get to and it means: deep experimentation, branching out and becoming a leader. I hope I helped! Once again, I invite you to try Supreme Track services, however if you prefer to do EDM production on your own I wish you the best of luck! Hope I helped! ",
