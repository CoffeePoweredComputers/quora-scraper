            "answer_text": "There are kits available for almost any make and model that was originally equipped with drum brakes. Having said that, only very old cars have drum brakes on the front axle. These cars are the only ones that would benefit from a conversion. Drum brakes are perfectly fine on the rear axle. There is no significant benefit changing rear drum brakes to disc brakes unless you are racing. Rear brakes only contribute about 30% of the braking effort. Spending time and effort to convert rear drum brakes to disc brakes is not worth it in most circumstances. Also, rear drum brakes last much longer and are much cheaper to maintain than rear disc brakes. Again, if you are not involved in competitive racing converting rear drums to discs is not worth the effort. If your car is old enough to have drums on the front then that is a different story. Drum brakes on the front axle are a real pain . ",

            "answer_text": "YES you can always do that it will require a little modification in your braking and hub assembly. the effect would be that disc brakes are more efficient when it comes to thermal heat dissipation capacity and will work longer than drum. also the amount of braking torque and force that will be received by wheels will be enhanced and hence stopping distance will be reduced. but you must have a good idea of your vehicles bhp and torque before you replace your drum brakes with disc. sometimes you dont need a large braking action as it may lock your wheels.

            "answer_text": "Yes, drum brakes can be replaced with disc brakes but the conversion will need adapters to change the hub that holds the brake in place. Also, for switching rear brakes in a car the handbrake( parking brake) needs to be modified accordingly to accommodate disc brakes. Finally, the brake bias has to to changed since now the discs will have much more bite and stopping power Compared to drum brakes, and might result in fishtailing under hard braking. ",

            "answer_text": "I googled conversion kits for drum to disc. I tried to copy the URL, but couldn't. My expertise definitely does not include cell phones. It looks like front brake kits run about $899 and 4 wheel kits are around $1599. Of course you have to add labor if you can't do it yourself. You would get by quite well with front discs only, although 4 wheel discs are real stoppers. The first car I owned with 4 wheel discs was a 1983 Lincoln Continental. The brakes were great. The main problem with drums is heat fade. Repeated stops like driving down a steep hill causes loss of braking efficiency. I remember large cars of the 60\u2019s like Buick and Cadillac's had huge drum brakes with cooling fins on them. Good luck. ",
