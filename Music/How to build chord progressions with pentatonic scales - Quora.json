            "answer_text": "If you want to build chords exclusively with the five notes in a pentatonic scale, just go ahead and stack those notes in different ways and find pleasant chords. Then string them together to create chord progressions. Something that is much more common in popular music is that many chord progressions are based on the roots of pentatonic scale degrees. Especially minor pentatonic scale is the main source of numerous rock compositions. A minor pentatonic consists of the notes A, C, D, E & G. These roots are harmonized to create major chords, so now we have five major chords. These chords are very common in popular music and they are used in different kind of chord progressions (Biamonte 2010.) In A major these chords would be I, \u266dIII, IV, V & \u266dVII - all of which are among the most commonly found chords in popular music. However, the tonic doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be A major. It\u2019s possible to create a chord progression of I \u2192 \u266dVII \u2192 IV \u2192 V in D major, for example. (By the way, those five chords, A, C, D, E & G are all open-string chords on guitar. What a coincidence\u2026) Use your imagination and go wild - come up with your own pentatonic scales and harmonies! Reference: Biamonte, N. (2010).

            "answer_text": "Pentatonic scales are lovely! But they come from a different world to traditional Western tonal systems. There are a few ways to approach their harmonization: - Use exclusively notes from the scale itself. Listen to examples of traditional Chinese (and other Asian) music based on a oentatonic scale. Of necessity, the harmonies would need to be thin. There would be many points in the composition where you were essentially using monopsony. Rests would start to take on more meaning. - You could also harmonise your pentatonic melody with notes from a Western scale, e,g, a major scale. The pentatonic scale is contained in the major scale so compatibility is easy enough. However, you would quite likely need to consider substituting leading note tones for suspensions and sustained notes, as the 7th degree of the major scale tends to pull the pentatonic where it doesn't want to. There are some lovely Asian classical works (e.g. piano concertos) in a Western idiom that can inspire you. - parallelism works well. Debussy is a prime example. Hope that helps! ",
