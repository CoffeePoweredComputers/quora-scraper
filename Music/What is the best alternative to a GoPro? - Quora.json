            "answer_text": "I like my DJI Osmo Pocket a lot, but it\u2019s kinda fragile with a gimbal for stabilization. I like it for it\u2019s 9-panel pano mode, lets me get a whole half a room with little distortion. I see where others like their Osmo Actions, and there are lots of comparisons directly with GoPro. It stabilizes images by getting a larger image through its very large lens, then applying digital stabilization. The demos they post of extreme action look really smooth. I don\u2019t have one, need camera drones, not action cameras, but I\u2019m brand-loyal to DJI, would buy this first if I needed a rugged camera. Either of the little Osmo cameras can get spectacular images, but the Action\u2019s got a larger lens and you can drop it, go swimming with it, put it on a harness with your dog\u2026 There are lots of cheaper GoPro-alternatives that somebody might swear are just fine after good experience with it. It really doesn\u2019t take a lot to make an image look good for a browser or a smartphone, and I\u2019ve been delighted with lots of cheaper alternatives, wish I could recommend a cheap action camera. Lots of them show up at Amazon or eBay and the feedback might help you pick a good-enough camera cheap. The Osmo Action is only reasonably priced for what it is, there must be some cheaper\u2026 ",
