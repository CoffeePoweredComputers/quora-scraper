            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll be honest here. Of course, you need the basic things. Like talent and skill. But the entertainment business is shady, so you also need a number of other things which are kind of unusual. Talent No one can make it in without talent. But there are cases when people aren\u2019t all that talented but are accepted because of the obvious passion, dedication, potential and beauty. You have to have a good voice and be able to dance properly. If you excel in at least one field, you are probably gonna make it in. For example, RM of BTS isn\u2019t that good in dance. But his rap makes up for it. Visual This may seem harsh, but you have really less chances of making it in without visuals. Especially in the bigger agencies, like SM, they prize visuals. I won\u2019t say that it\u2019s the inner beauty that matters, even though this phrase is true, it\u2019s BS for this world. But I can say that everyone is beautiful. But what they will judge you on will be based off of how attractive you are too. Some people are turned down the moment they walk in all because they were unattractive. You have to meet Korea\u2019s beauty standards or just be attractive in general. I\u2019ve heard many people say that they will still accept you if you are talented. Which is kind of true but now, I can say that it\u2019s only true for some cases. Visuals do matter. In this day and age, it\u2019s as if it\u2019s socially unacceptable for \u201cugly\u201d people to do anything. Basically, you have to be attractive. Personality If you wanna be an idol, then you have to have a persona, or just a bubbly personality in general. People will most likely look down on idols with a more quiet, offensive, sensual and/or different personality. To be completely honest, fan service includes your personality and the way you present yourself. Fans won\u2019t accept it if you aren\u2019t smiling at them 24/7. Having a bad day? Oh, that doesn\u2019t even matter, you still will have to smile. A more outgoing, bubbly, chaotic, cute, extroverted and innocent personality is what is attractive for the public, so they will accept you and love you. If you aren\u2019t like that, then you will have to wear a mask at all times just to please your fans. Basically, it\u2019s being a people pleaser and changing yourself for the sake of others. Tolerance The trainee system, diet, practice, sleepless nights and near to no privacy is really hard to handle and can drive a person crazy. I can\u2019t live without sleeping for at laeast 8 hours, eating lots and having privacy. So it\u2019ll be hard for someone like me to be able to tolerate everything that comes with fame. You are over-exposed as an idol. The schedule is insane. The diets are unhealthy. But, you can\u2019t break down. People won\u2019t really accept an idol who isn\u2019t smiling, isn't looking happy and is complaining about their schedules. You have to hide it with a smile, it\u2019s hard to oppose the system and have people support you. If you have one bad day and don\u2019t feel like carrying on, people won\u2019t accept it. All because you are a public figure. Just put the word idol into a sentence, and peope will expect you to be alright and be tolerant at all times. Groups like BTS are lucky to have fans like the majority of ARMY. ARMY accepted it when BTS would cry, be going through a hard time or just be not into the day. The fans don\u2019t say that \u201cit\u2019s their duty to not show their dissatisfication as they are a public figure.\u201d But, not everyone is like that, and people will always find things to criticize. Basically, without patience and tolerance, you will break down. And if you break down, people will hate on you, treat you like being an idol you have to be happy 24/7, won\u2019t accept it and treat you like you are arrogant. And if you are hated on, you will break down further. It\u2019s necessary to have tolerance. Be An Artist There\u2019s a fine line between an artist and an idol. An artist is someone whose involved in the music they make. Some examples are Hui of Pentagon, LE of EXID, BTS, Jessi and 3RACHA. And people who are just an idol, are people like Blackpink, EXO, TWICE and a few other SM idols. Now, I accept it if you don\u2019t songwrite, produce or compose your own songs. But I also prefer idols to be involved in their work, so whatever they sing about is coming from the heart, and many nights were sacrificed to make it yourself with the help of others. And, to be honest, I wouldn\u2019t really want to Stan a group who isn\u2019t involved in their work. I just prefer idols to be artists but I do accept the other side too. But nowadays, people hate on idols who aren\u2019t involved in their work. A lot of people hate on idols who don\u2019t songwrite. And they also call them untalented. That\u2019s just extra turmoil and no one will want to go through that. So it\u2019s best to learn how to songwrite/produce/compose so people will accept and respect you. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been struggling with these few words for a couple of months now: I want to be a K-Pop Idol- But\u2026 I want to be a K-Pop Idol. I truly do. The feeling is welling up inside of me, a dream, a wish, a hope that I want more than anything right now. I\u2019m willing to give up everything. My privacy, my time, I would put everything I have into it. I know that I have the determination. When I start something, I finish it. I absolutely love working until I can\u2019t, I absolutely love pushing myself past my limits. I love music more than anything, I always have. I have musical talent in my family. Music inspires me. Music is me. I\u2019ve always loved music in every way. Especially dance. And ever since I\u2019ve gotten into K-Pop, I\u2019ve been learning dance after dance, technique after technique, I\u2019m even spending the time and money for a professional trainer that worked with Girls Generation and Psy. I\u2019m putting my everything into my dream. But I don\u2019t know why, because the fact is, I will never be a K-Pop idol. Now, you\u2019re going to tell me as I\u2019ve heard from my friends, \u201cWell, with that attitude, no you won\u2019t. It sounds like you\u2019ve got the time and money, and determination to live your dreams. I bet you could!\u201d But I can\u2019t. And it\u2019s not my decision. So let me start with my first reason. My religion/culture isn\u2019t against, but strongly tries to keep us away from showy clothing, plastic surgery, etc. I think all the rules and restrictions of being a trainee and an idol will be against what I believe in. People ask me, \u201cJust forget about your rules. You can do what you want. Nothing is stopping you. If you follow your rules and don\u2019t become an idol, well that\u2019s your fault.\u201d And I guess that\u2019s true. But on to the next problem, that I can\u2019t control no matter what, is that I can\u2019t diet. I\u2019ve got a health restraint that I can\u2019t go into detail about. I could diet, but in no way, shape, or form would it work how they want. Heck, I\u2019d have to write that on my audition form, I\u2019m guessing, and they\u2019d turn me down right away. If not, once they realized, they\u2019d kick me out for sure. I can\u2019t go into detail, but there\u2019s no way any diet, even if it\u2019s very specific to what I need will get me where they want me, without hurting me worse and making me unable to do anything at all. I guess this is my biggest problem, verses the other one. Lastly, I can\u2019t sing. I guess I\u2019d learn from them if I got in just because of my talent in dancing, but I hear a lot that you have to sing as well. At least a bit. Hey, I\u2019m not the worst, but I\u2019m not specifically talented in singing in any way. I\u2019d probably be a rapper, but I just don\u2019t know\u2026 I think most K-Pop fans want this, they have this dream, wish, hope, just as I do. The thought that I\u2019d have a group that I\u2019d perform with, dancing and singing my heart out, giving people hope is what I want in this life. I don\u2019t care about the fame. I want to be like my idol, J-Hope from BTS. I want to give people a reason to smile, no matter what. I want to bring people the joy he brings me. All I\u2019ve ever wanted in my life is to help others, to bring them joy. That is my ultimate goal. And becoming a K-Pop idol, I hope would help me do that. And people tell me that I just want K-Pop because I am a fan myself, but I really like how Korea does groups, and it\u2019s not just singing, but dancing and rapping. I want to do K-Pop, but I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t. I know the consequesnces. I know what you have to give up. I know the pain. I know being a trainee isn\u2019t everything you imagine. It\u2019s enough for me. I still want it. I\u2019ve put in a lot of consideration. I know what it takes and I\u2019m willing. A lot of people who made answers on this question say that they grew out of it. They grew out of their dream. Maybe I will, but I honestly hope not. My hope right now is that I\u2019ll find some opportunity here in America where I can do something with dance, music, and performing. Something close enough. I might have a chance since America isn\u2019t as strict. That is my hope. I will always love K-Pop, but I don\u2019t have a chance with the industry. So, I hope America can give me the same joy. That\u2019s the only thing that keeps me going right now because my dream to be a K-Pop idol still burns inside of me like fire, it\u2019s so strong. And it hurts that I can\u2019t be a K-Pop idol. I just hope America can give me the same joy. And if I do grow out of this dream, I\u2019ve got other talents and things I wanted before I got into K-Pop. So I have a pretty good future ahead, I guess. We\u2019ll see. So to answer your question, yes, I do really want to be a K-Pop idol. Will I? No. Can I? No. But I\u2019m going to look on the bright side, and once again, hopefully America can give me the same joy in one way or another. If anyone thinks they have advice for me, I\u2019d appreciate it a lot. Thanks, and I hope this answers your question. ",

I mean, I think everyone once imagined to be popular and famous and rich once when they were young, but now that I know the consequences of being famous, I wouldn't dream of becoming a star. Yes, having fans shout out your name as they fantasize about meeting you in person, people asking for your autograph, your albums being bought every-so hour is fascinating. You get money, fame, and love. But there's also bad causes to this. First you need to sign a contract with whatever label. You have to dedicate your whole time in the whole recording the songs, practicing the choreography, making the MVS, having to go to concerts, dealing with super possessive fans, having to meet the dead line, watching your diet, making sure you have the right style, having to be careful out in public, all these hours spent on something that can go down at any second for something so small. For example, you're out somewhere on live TV and you say something but people mistake it to a whole different meaning. Next thing you know, you're in social media with so many people criticizing you for something you did not mean. All that hard work goes down the toilet for just a misunderstanding. So much time goes by trying to raise to the top, when you can spent your precious time with family and friends. Free from cameras and paparazzi, you can go out in the street in your pj\u2019s and not have to worry about someone commenting on your choice of style. I'm not saying that Kpop Stars deal with such slavery work, but they don't have the life of a normal citizen, they deal with do much crap, it's stressful. I can barely go without a day of complaints. I whine about homework, when these Kpop stars have to deal with getting the right pitch and lyrics for their songs, need to dance to \u201cperfection\u201d, be able to deal with fans. I just can't do that. Kpop stars also have to deal with training. It can take years for me to finally debut (exaggeration). Patience is not one of my virtues. And then not being able to see my parents for who knows how long?! Nope. That's a definite No-No right there. I have to see my mom everyday. So my answer is a definite no. Being able to be on screen and having my name being chanted by millions of people, sounds great. But being able to stay home in my cozy room with my mom and dress like a slob whenever I want to, sounds much better ",

            "answer_text": "depends on what you mean, either if you wanna be a Kpop idol, or just someone involved in Kpop musically. If you meant the former, then of course, you have to audition. But auditioning means you either have to have: Talent- which is the main reason for being a performer/ idol. You either have to be good at what you\u2019re doing, and by good I mean exceptionally good because there are a lot of people aiming for what you are and doing what you\u2019re gonna do, and sometimes, there are going to be people much more better than you. But of course, don\u2019t lose hope. Maybe you\u2019ll just be what the company is looking for. Visuals- you\u2019re good-looking by Korean standards and you have decent talent even if you\u2019re not good at it. They\u2019ll take you in if you fit their style and you have potential lol. See Seventeen\u2019s Mingyu, for example. The guy literally got scouted while he was out playing soccer and auditioned with SLIPPERS ON WHILE SINGING THE KOREAN NATIONAL ANTHEM (istg i hate him so much lmfao) but guess what? he\u2019s handsome and the CEO liked him so he\u2019s in BUT he improved himself and can now sing, dance, and is one of the group\u2019s rappers and is an emcee in Music Core now. So even if you look good, you gotta put effort to actually know how to do something or else you\u2019ll get hated on. But all idols get hated on by someone so better lessen the haters while you have the chance lol Mingyu rapping for reference:  so either of the two, or connections. connections are eVERytHIng in any industry tbh So you auditioned. Great! But wow. are there a lot more people. Bluntly, there will be people 10X better than you, but seriously, it all boils down to luck. If the company likes you, even if the other guy was better than you in all areas, then lucky you ! you\u2019re in! not as a trainee. but in the 2nd round of auditions lol Auditions have normally 3 rounds. Public. Private.Then a very long Interview. If you pass all those, you\u2019re a trainee! But the training process is much more harder than the audition process along with years of training every day and you\u2019re not even sure if you\u2019re gonna debut. Which is scary and nerve-wracking. But if you wanna dedicate your teenage years to something that you really wanna do then why not? But heed my advice: ALWAYS HAVE A PLAN B Companies may kick you out if you don\u2019t improve in your skills enough or if they\u2019re wondering why you\u2019re even there. And the training process is a literal jungle, if the company is planning to debut a group, then expect The Hunger Games to happen every man for himself regardless of your relationships. Why? Because you came there to debut and to become an idol. I can go on and on but I\u2019m sleepy and that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got so far. If you wanna be an idol, train hard before auditioning and stand out. That\u2019s all I gotta say. Dm me for more questions! Anyway, good luck if you wanna be an idol!! <3 ",

            "answer_text": "Are you asking specifically if a boy, as in, a child, can become K-Pop idol? Or are you asking if a male Korean can become an idol? Please specify in future questions if you want a genuine answer. IF YOU ARE A MALE AND YOU WANT TO BECOME A K-POP IDOL There are hundreds of male K-Pop idols. I can name a few groups just off the top of my head- BTS, EXO- Monsta X, GOT7, etc. And those are just a few of the more popular ones. Yes, it is possible for you to become a K-Pop idol. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW IF A CHILD CAN BECOME A K-POP IDOL I personally haven\u2019t heard about young children becoming K-Pop idols, since it requires hard training and often brutal workouts, and I doubt some of the bigger companies are able (or willing) to take care of a 7 year old\u2019s needs. The youngest I\u2019ve ever heard an idol to be at debut was 14 years old. And even then they\u2019d started training at a younger age, usually around 13. IF YOU (OR SOMEONE ELSE) WANTS TO BECOME A K-POP IDOL I am not going to sugarcoat this. K-Pop is a dark, dark industry. If you don\u2019t have true dedication, then your chances are at zero. Many trainees who truly love music have to leave because it is taking too much of a toll on their bodies. There are many people who want to become a K-Pop idol just so they can meet their favorite groups (BTS, EXO, BLACKPINK, just to name a few), maybe even hope to date/marry. If you want to become an idol for this reason, it is highly doubtful that you will make it, since even for Koreans, it takes a lot of true dedication to music to be able to debut. Also, many companies have precautions to prevent harassment. It isn\u2019t impossible to become a K-Pop idol, even if you don\u2019t have the standard Korean looks. However, there are a number of factors that can contribute to whether or not you\u2019d be successful: Are you Asian? There are a number of Chinese and Japanese K-Pop idols, along with some Taiwanese. However, these people tend to receive more hate, just because they\u2019re not from the same culture. If you\u2019re not at least partly Asian, the chances of you making it grow slimmer.Can you speak Korean? This is perhaps the biggest one. If you can\u2019t, you most likely won\u2019t make it.How good is your dancing/singing/rapping? No matter how pretty you are, if you can\u2019t dance, sing, or rap decently, the chances of you making it are slim, unless you\u2019re hoping to join as a visual.Are you ready for intense training? K-Pop idols don\u2019t become famous overnight. I can\u2019t emphasize this enough. IT IS NOT ALL FUN AND GAMES. We only see their good side, the happy side. On the other side of the screen, there may be bullying, suicidal thoughts, and tears, and we would never know. The training they go through is so intense, and many companies treat their idols like trash, so never mind about the trainees.Something else you should worry about is how you will convince companies to accept you as a trainee. This is not racism or prejudice- it\u2019s the simple fact that they need to eat and feed their family. They need to worry about whether you\u2019d be successful, because if you don\u2019t, their reputation becomes tainted. RANT I might\u2019ve sounded rude at some points during writing this, but that\u2019s because I\u2019m tired of people who just want to become K-Pop idols because they think that they\u2019ll be famous, they\u2019ll get to be friends with their favorite stars, everyone will love them, all they need to have is a pretty face. NO! It takes years for idols to train, and then some ignorant people come along and act like it\u2019s nothing. They work their butts off trying to please their fans, to produce good quality content, and they often starve themselves. My friend told me that she wanted to become an idol under Big Hit so she could marry BTS. Too many people think that it takes just a nice voice to become a star, that it happens overnight. And it doesn\u2019t. APOLOGIES IF I OFFENDED ANYONE, BUT I MEANT EVERY WORD I SAID. GOOD DAY. ",

            "answer_text": "Do I want to become a K-Pop idol? YES. Yes, I do. Ever since I found out about BTS, I always admired their charisma, amazing talent, and the love that they show to their fans. But I thought that if I were to become someone like them (female version) will I even be able to become so high up, praised and inspiring? Over time, I realised that BigHit does not do female groups, but even if they did, I would\u2019ve been too much of a coward to even apply. Why? Because I felt like I wasn\u2019t good enough, I would embarrass myself, and I was afraid to be judged negatively. Then, I got interested in Blackpink. They are my favourite girl group. I became inspired by them, each one of them had an impact on my dream to become an idol. I wanted to be just like them, good at dance, good at singing/rapping, have charisma, be beautiful like them, and be inspiring. But there were certain things that stopped me from actually believing in myself. I cannot perform on stage very well, especially if it is by myself (because I get nervous and instantly feel like people are laughing at me on the inside).I do not think I am good looking enough or fit enough to audition.I do not believe I am talented enough.I don\u2019t believe I am good enough in general.I don\u2019t know Korean (I\u2019m from Australia, also an Australian Born Chinese).I am not a very out-going and confident person. I was bullied in primary school, but now that I moved to high school, things are better. But the bullying had a huge impact on my self-esteem. I am constantly judging myself either for my body, face or both. But at the same time, I wanted to become an idol SO FREAKING BAD. I wanted to inspire people, to show people that I can be good enough, to be confident and to do what makes me happy. I don\u2019t know why, but I was sort of ashamed to admit that I wanted to become a K-pop idol. Maybe it was the fact that I thought that people thought I was pathetic? Or maybe it was the fact that I thought I was pathetic MYSELF? Both? I knew that it wasn\u2019t just that simple to become an idol. The first step is to audition, and if you get accepted, HALLELUJAH. But then you have to fight to be at the top, you have to train, work hard, and follow strict rules. Then you have the people who decide your fate, are you ready to debut? If you do, GREAT! You succeeded. But the fight doesn\u2019t stop there, you still have to compete with other groups, it\u2019s a race to the top. Idols are supposed to follow strict rules, they have to train hours and hours just to make the performance perfect. They have to endure the pain and tiring hours. They have to remain \u201csqueaky-clean\u201d, scandal-less and practically perfect. Some idols even do diets that include eating only a few things a day. Some starve themselves. I know that being an idol is tough. I mean, some members from BTS almost fainted and collapsed due to exhaustion. I\u2019m going to be honest, I think that the K-Pop industry is a little too extreme, but I am willing to try it. This is the only dream that I have been this passionate about. I recently quit my dance studio after attending it for one year. But for that one year, I never felt like I was good enough, yes, I was the youngest and smallest one there, I had the least experience, but I never felt like I belonged there. I was never confident enough. Now, I practice dances by following tutorials (mostly K-Pop dances) and I practice singing by myself. If an audition comes up for the company I would like to be a part of (YG Entertainment), I don\u2019t know how I am supposed to tell my parents. I can\u2019t just all of a sudden tell them, \u201chey, there is an audition for this company I really wanna be a part of, but it\u2019s in (this country, most likely Korea or Japan), can we PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE book a flight because this is my dream?\u201d No, I can\u2019t just do that, I don\u2019t know if my parents support this (my dad probably doesn\u2019t understand, both my parents would most likely want me to focus on my studies) and they probably think I am too young to do such things. I just turned 13, and there was an application for YG Ent. a few days ago, but I missed it. I don\u2019t know what to do with myself, if I want something SO SO BAD, but I feel like I can\u2019t do it. People say you only live once, and that one life, goes away faster than you think. Even if I do get my head around these things, I don\u2019t know if I can regain my confidence. I don\u2019t know if I can believe in myself enough to do this. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to endure all the hours of practise and hard work. But I know that maybe one day, I will be willing to give it a go. I just hope when the time comes, I am not too late. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019d be really cool, and I might audition a few times just to try it out\u2014if not, it\u2019s alright, but I still think auditioning would be a good opportunity for me. In all honesty, I believe I\u2019d be prepared for all of the things that come with being a K-pop idol, such as the constant training, the chance of being hated and bashed by the public, etc etc. I\u2019m going to go over all the parts of being a K-pop idol and how they\u2019d affect me if I were to actually pursue it. First things first: the beauty standards. Oh, my, the beauty standards are incredibly strict in Korea and many other Asian countries. In some ways, the appearance of an idol can really impact their career more than talent. Here\u2019s a list of the beauty standards in Korea: Slim figure - I have this.Small face - I\u2026 think I have this?V-shaped jaw - My jawline is more rounded and not quite what is desired; although, many k-pop idols do have a jawline/shape similar to mine.Small lips - Not quite. Some idols do have my lip shape but, unless I\u2019m mistaken, it is not ideal.Straight eye-brows - Nope, but that could easily be fixed by make-up and/or styling them. They are quite thicc, though.Flawless skin - I thank my mother for the good skin genes\u2014I don\u2019t really have to deal with blemishes or pimples too often.Large eyes - My eyes are in between normal and large, I believe.Double eyelids - Yup!Extremely pale skin - My skin color is light, but not nearly as pale and white as the Korean beauty standard. It looks way lighter in good lighting, but in normal lighting my skin is slightly darker.East Asian - I\u2019m only half Thai, which is technically Southeast Asian, however, it\u2019s more of a problem to be half white in the K-pop industry; I\u2019d probably face some backlash for that. There are half-white K-pop idols, though, such as Seventeen\u2019s Vernon and Momoland\u2019s Nancy.One of my biggest insecurities about my face is my face shape, I think. I wish my jaw was more v-shaped. I guess plastic surgery could fix that, though. Let\u2019s take a look at my face and figure and compare it to the Korean beauty standard:   The Korean beauty standard:  My figure (I\u2019ve used these pictures before in an answer):    gags at the promise ring on my finger man I regret that relationship\u2014 Oh, sorry, where were we? Right, here\u2019s what the ideal body is for a K-pop idol.  Eh, pretty close. Although, my Thai relatives said they think I\u2019m fat, but oh well. Next up: talent/ability. K-pop idols are usually expected to have a combination of these skills, although not necessarily all of them when you\u2019re first auditioning: Singing - I think I\u2019m pretty good at singing. It could use work, though, so with a lot of effort, practice, and a good vocal coach, I think I could be really good.Rapping - Well\u2026 rapping isn\u2019t exactly my strong suit; I\u2019m definitely not going to be the next L.E. or Jessi or something, but I can see myself being the sub-rapper of a group if needed. In the ironic words of my best friend from my old state, who got me into K-pop, \u201cyOu dOn\u2019T gOt thAt sWaGgER, nAm-sAyin\u2019 hOmiE\u201dDancing - I used to be in my school\u2019s drama club, where we had to sing and dance at the same time, and I could pick up the choreography pretty quickly. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have any problems training in a dance studio setting.If I were to be in a K-pop girl band, I\u2019d probably prefer being a vocalist over a rapper, simply because that\u2019s what my voice is more comfortable with and more used to. If my dancing skills improved, and my visuals are way better in the future, then center dancer would be cool, too. But of course, that\u2019s a stretch, there are few idols that can pull off being talented at all three\u2014but they\u2019re out there! ANDDDD CONCLUSION: It is extremely, extremely difficult to become an idol. The chances of me making the auditioning or even debuting is very slim, which is why I might just pursue a singing career here in America\u2014it\u2019s just as difficult, but there won\u2019t be language barriers. Of course, I\u2019m gonna think things through, and wait until I\u2019m older to figure out what I want to do with my\u2026 idol career, and such. ",

            "answer_text": "You can. However, it will be hard. Entertainments mainly look for people who are from an asian decent, and look asian. Yes there is a black female idol, Alex Reid from Rania, but it won\u2019t be as easy for those who are non-asian as it was for Alex. The Korean industry is infamous for its slight bias on asians. If you are really serious about becoming an idol, then why not? Annually, many entertainments hold auditions around the world. The main locations are: America, Australia and of course South Korea itself. You can audition with whatever, singing, dancing etc. You must be prepared to literally give yourself up, and dedicate everything to becoming a Kpop Idol. You will be competing against many other trainees, some who have been in the industry for a while, others newbies just like you, all aspiring for just one thing, to become an idol. Entertainments will expect you to practice day and night for hours on end, while also fitting in lessons (if you are still in the education process), singing/dancing practice, composing/producing music, and don\u2019t forget you\u2019ll be rivalling with other trainees. You will be put on a strict diet, to meet the standard of Korean beauty. If you are in a position where it will be hard for you to move to South Korea, and participate in the activities that a normal trainee would. No worries, entertainments are very desperate for trainees so they would invest in everything that you need to be brought to you. A dance teacher, singing teacher, trainer, staff and more. They will pay for this all. In conclusion, the Kpop Industry is like a battlefield. There will be many obstacles, and only the best come out alive. So if you\u2019re ready to fight and determine that place as an idol, go for it. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been working in and out of some companies and to be completely honest, the idea of being a kpop idol is a little exaggerated. The fame is of the practically 1%. However, the idea is still nice. I\u2019ve coached around 200 trainees but have only coached around 20 personally. The stress is a lot but the determination in some of them is surprising. The thought of debut is enough to encourage people to go beyond their limits and it\u2019s truly amazing. I\u2019m 22 and when I was 15, I was a accepted into - - Entertainment as a trainee. At the time, I truly wanted to become a kpop star and I would stay up for up to 2 days to practice. It sounds cruel but if you have the right mindset. I guess the deciding factor is your motive. WHY do you want to become an idol? Fame? Wealth? I wanted to inspire people and hope that when they saw my performances, I\u2019d make them happy and have hope because I don\u2019t come from a privileged background. I kept that mindset and trained for two years. However, I was still counted as a resident in the United States and had applied to college and chose to go to college in the states instead of pursuing my dream. Why? Because I realized even though my dream sounded nice, in the inside, it was still because I wanted to be known. I was bullied from elementary school til I left to train and my underlying motive I found was to prove the bullies wrong. It wasn\u2019t to make people happy; it was to make people feel bad instead. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t pursue my first dream. Now I work alongside with potential kpop idols and I still inspire them to pursue their dreams because I lived mine. Fortunate enough, I still can perform in front of people and make them feel good when they master a routine. ",

            "answer_text": "To be honest, no When i was younger, around 7-8, i got into kpop, my 1st ever kpop group was girls generation, they are my role models and i look up to them alot. I would always dance to thier songs and stuff like that, the idol life seemed nice, but that was because i was young, and i did not know that much of it. When i was around 12-13, that was when i really thought of becoming a kpop idol. I thought it would be the coolest thing in the world, i thought since im a pretty good dancer and have decent visuals i could maybe make it in, but looking back, i think my head was up in the clouds a bit too much and never considered what the consequences would be. Now that i am 15, i do not want to, there still is a teny tiny bit of me that wants to, but i usually shut down the fact with a check of reality. The thing is, i do not think foreigners would fit into kpop. Im sorry if this breaks your little dream, but its true, it won't work out, there is very little chance of it happening. Companies usually only accept asians and asians ONLY. Know, i KNOW there are non korean/Asian idols out there today and some that were in it back then, but if you look at it closely, its not working out. Alex from raina left cause it was too much for her, that one French girl in a kpop group was never heard from again, and in general, foriegners can make a debut, but their popularity isn't the strongest it would be, because they are forgieners, they aren't asian, they aren't korean, it does not workout. Back to my example, i acutally auditioned when i was 13 for a well known korean company, and to my suprise, i got a email after auditioning. Looking back i am glad i did not accept, the kpop idol life is extremely hard, i would not keep up with it at all. I am glad i have my freedom and can do what i want without people judging me for who i am or what my face looks like. I am korean/mexican mix, my grandma is Korean (on moms side) and my grandpa was mexican. I could have been a kpop idol, but thank god i turned the offer down. Tbh people who want to become kpop idols and are not asian or korean are a bit delusional to me. If you REALLY REALLY want to become an artist, then become it in your country, no need to go to a whole different country to be an artist, its worthless, it won't work out, face reality, your not korean, your not asian, even if you do get accepted, the training process is extremely hard, and you don't even know if your going to make it into a group. Your popularity wont be that high unLESS you come out of the big 3. To all kpop fans out there that want to become a idol, think about you, your health, your family, friends, etc.. is it really worth it? Is it? To loose all your privileges due to a dream that is too far our of your grip? Think about it, and make sure you have a taste or reality when thinking. Just cause your unnie lana did it, does NOT mean you are going to be able to do it too. Make sure you go through the question once, twice, and thrice if needed to. If you are really hardheaded and think you can genuinely make it, then go for it, just make sure to think about the consequences your little dream will have on you and all the people around you. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Let\u2019s take a look and see if I fit the Korean beauty standards or not. Slim Figure I am pretty skinny, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m skinny enough (I\u2019m 5\u20193.5 and I weigh 102.8 lbs). If I had to diet, I would probably just eat small amounts of food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and exercise a lot (I\u2019ll be practicing a lot so that should count). Small Face Eh kinda, but my forehead is kinda big V-shaped jaw No, but there are idols out there who have succeeded without a v-shaped jaw Small/plump lips my lips are thin and heart shaped straight eyebrows my eyebrows are mostly straight with a little arch flawless skin i have sorta bad acne since i\u2019m 14 and since i have freckles, i\u2019ll use some natural remedies to lighten them larger eyes/aegyo-sal i have doe eyes and double eyelids in conclusion, i look average but not ugly. how about my skills? vocal: i\u2019ve been taking vocal classes since june 2018. by now i\u2019d say i could be a lead or sub vocalist dance: i\u2019ve been taking dance lessons on and off since i was six but i plan to take more in my sophomore year. someone told me i am a very expressive dancer. rap: i\u2019m not the best rapper, i haven\u2019t taken any lessons even though there\u2019s a low chance i could get into an agency due to me not having a lot of Asian blood (12.5% Japanese), what if i actually got into an agency and got to train? first of all, that would be super hard, but i still want to go and see for myself. i\u2019m not the type to give up easily, but i would give up if i really(x100) had to, like if i started to feel suicidal or i developed really poor health conditions. i know the training won\u2019t be easy. i\u2019ll have to eat, practice, sleep, repeat. IMO, being able to debut and succeed is all based on luck. the non-asian idols we have now were lucky enough to train and debut, but not lucky enough to succeed in Korea. idols who are white like me (Lana, majority of UHSN, Unionwave\u2019s Miriam and Nia, O My Jewel\u2019s Sophia, and EXP Edition) give me hope that I could debut if I\u2019m lucky enough, but what makes me doubt myself is the fact that most international fans are going to be pressed because I have white privilege. Just like Lana, I could also see myself probably getting accused of having surgery to look Korean since I have 12.5% Japanese ethnicity. Or maybe they won\u2019t be able to tell, I don\u2019t know. All that I know, if I\u2019m talented and or lucky enough to debut, people are going to hate on me because I am Not half or full Asian andWhite privilegedI\u2019m not trying to colonize kpop with my whiteness, okay? Like I said, I have white privilege so my chances at getting into an agency are higher but not as high as half Asians. It\u2019s hard but I try to ignore the non-Koreans who say \u201cK-pop is only for Asians you koreaboo.\u201d IMO, anyone can be a K-pop idol if they can sing, dance, or rap and in Korean, but not in Koreaboo style. No \u201coNiOnHaSeYo OpPaR\u201d \u201csArAnG mE jUsEyO,\u201d etc. I bet the people who speak like that are just in it to meet their oppars and become a Y/N. Until I decide I don\u2019t want to be a K-pop idol anymore, I will continue working hard by improving my skills in dancing and singing and learning Korean so I can maybe get into an agency. ",

            "answer_text": "yay you! anyone can be an idol, but it\u2019s extremely difficult. first, audition for either the big 3 (YG, SM, JYP - JYP is the nicest) or a smaller company like happyface ent (has dreamcatcher). i wouldn\u2019t recommend pledis or cube because they\u2019re known for mistreatment. i\u2019m using JYP as an example since i have auditioned twice. JYP likes natural idols (no two faced), uniqueness, obviously skill, and looks (but they don\u2019t care as much as say\u2026SM). don\u2019t sing a language you are not familiar with. if you manage to pass the auditions (which would be difficult), you\u2019ll have to have a second audition either in korea (they might pay, but be aware that you might have to pay too). if you pass that\u2026 according to an ex SM trainee, basketballs were dropped on their stomach to \u201cstrengthen them\u201d. so if your passion is always at 100%, you\u2019re eager to improve, are happy for monthly body and skill evaluations, will know to not talk back, you are happy to train from basically 5/6am - 1\u20132am every day (yes, am to am) with sometimes no meals and school in between, potentially get trainee debt which you\u2019ll have to pay pack if you debut or if you terminate your trainee contract, face the potential of not being paid fairly or at all (X1 hasn\u2019t been paid a single cent yet) and will always keep in the back of your mind that you could train for years and not debut at all in the end, you\u2019ll begin training. i assume you don\u2019t know korean, so you\u2019ll have to learn that and your traineeship will go for longer. think you can take your time? lisa from blackpink almost didn\u2019t debut because she didn\u2019t learn quick enough. trainee contracts take around 2\u20135 years? (stray kids\u2019 bang chan trained for approximately 7 years). if you successfully complete your training and debut, yay! don\u2019t forget me when you\u2019re famous. ",

            "answer_text": "Do you want to become a K-pop idol? When I was a kid, I had aspirations of being a famous dancer/singer with any one of the two troupes I was a member of. I wrote songs, I modeled for a minute, won a talent show with one troupe, even dealt to some extent, with an up and coming music producer. He had no chance of getting us any real work, so we ditched him. I continued to perceive the world as my eventual moneymaking playground, planning to take it over one day. If that same kid were somehow transported to this day and age, with his lust for stardom, I might have wanted to become a K-pop idol. I wouldn't listen to anyone telling me I couldn't do it. I would ignore the same racial divides you guys do, and hold onto a distant hope of making it. Somehow. And I'd learn the value of experiencing failure at a young age. I'd never make it to South Korea, hell I'd doubtfully even learn Korean. JYP and friends would watch my videos long enough to compose a suitable rejection letter and move on. This would happen to me over and over again until I faced facts. Suddenly, I'd pay more attention. \u201cThere are no black K-pop idols,\u201d I'd say to myself. And I'd wonder what that was about. Finally, I'd see that my parents were right. The things I read on the internet were true. The starving, the disbanding groups, the small percentage of success. Going to South Korea would stop making any sense. Slowly, I would come to realize that it was all a dream and nothing more. And I would come up with something more practical and logical. If I was working in TV, which is probable, I'd meet BTS some years later. They'd show up for an interview on some show I was working on in NYC. I would be pretty excited to meet them as they got back together for a special comeback event. After the show, I'd step up to them and introduce myself. \u201cMan, you guys were great. I was a really big fan growing up.\u201d I'd take a pic with them, post it on Facebook, and go back to work. Okay bye. ",

            "answer_text": "YES YES YES!!!! I\u2019ve been really into Kpop for a bit. I wouldn\u2019t have even considered the thought of becoming a Kpop idol before I met BTS, Blackpink, and mamamoo. They really have inspired me with their music. I want to be in a group and make music for that group so I can inspire others like me to follow their dreams. There\u2019s a few problems that have definitely crossed my mind though. Im not Asian in any way (from what I know) I\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s very hard to become a Kpop idol if your not East Asian at all but that still hasn\u2019t stopped me from dreaming.2. The trainee process. This one isn\u2019t much of a problem for me because singing, dancing and songwriting are what I\u2019m absolutely passionate about so I\u2019m going to try my hardest either way and I\u2019m ready to be absolutely pulled apart being a trainee. The only part I\u2019m worried about is the chance of actually making it to debut as not many trainees make it to that. 3. Age/education. I really want to focus on my education but the entertainment companies really want them young so I really don\u2019t know what to do. My parents also don\u2019t really support me in my idea so they would never let me go to South Korea to audition. Those are my concerns. No I\u2019m not trying to pursue Kpop because I want to meet my \u201coppa\u201d it\u2019s because I\u2019m really passionate about Kpop. I\u2019m willing to do anything for my dream and that mind set is the only thing that has kept me from giving up my dream. At this point I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve thought about anything but that! Anyway I\u2019m not giving up anytime soon. Everyday I work harder towards becoming a Kpop idol and I know it\u2019s going to be hard. ",

            "answer_text": "YES. I would love to become a K-pop (or C-pop) idol. I love singing and dancing and am okay at both. I have tried to audition before and am very aware about the dark sides of the industry. Despite my many attempts at auditioning for all kinds of companies and shows (Idol School, Kpop Star, SM Entertainment, JYP Entertainment, Source Music and more), I have not gotten past the initial round of auditioning. It is terribly devastating, but I have accepted my fate. I do not think it is because of my ethnicity (I am ABC aka American Born Chinese) or my age (I auditioned from 13\u201315) or even my talent (tbh, there are idols that I can out sing and dance) that I failed to get in. It is because of my face. It is a fact I am well aware of and okay with. After all, I can only learn to love my face (or I could fix it, but I don\u2019t want to). Even now, if I am guaranteed a spot in a girl group, I would drop everything immediately and go. I would leave my comfortable life here, and go live in that starving, impoverished, desperate, judgmental, exhausted world if I could debut. But I can\u2019t. And I am alright with that. When I was obsessed with becoming an idol, a little voice in the back of my mind always said, \u201cBut don\u2019t you want to be a normal human? Don\u2019t you want to have a steady job, a quiet life, and be able to marry without receiving hate?\u201d And I do. I am not a loud or extravagant person. I would enjoy a quiet life. I do want to get married early enough to safely have a child or two. I want to have a healthy body. I want to have a steady income and job. I want both lives at once, and I have only chosen the more realistic side. It still is not too late for me. I still am only 16 years old. I still sing and dance as a hobby, and every time I see idols performing, I wish I could too. I couldn\u2019t watch Kpop Star or Idol School or even Produce 101. Even if I see a clip, I feel the urge to start again. To audition more. But I will not. And I cannot. And even though I had not ever entered the industry, I have learned a few things. I am, firstly, much more appreciative of idols. I also am able to tolerate idols\u2019 a lot more. I think I will be able to live my life much more happily and more positively then if I had never had such a dream. ",

            "answer_text": "When I was 13 and just got into KPOP, I probably have answered with no hesitation \"YES, DUH!\" Now that I've grown up and realized how fragile I am, the answer would be with no hesitation \"Heck no.\" As a Chinese American teenager, to go into a country that has a relatively homogenous society and thus would have a hard time assimilating, to go into a system that criticizes your looks and your weight, to be expected to be forgo all sleep to practice singing and dancing, not see your family for the years that you're a trainee and even after you debut, live with girls that you've teamed up with because maybe you're musically or visually compatible and not necessarily socially compatible, not be able to pursue any romance, are expected to be positive all the time, have to put up with stalker fans and paparazzi, etc.  I've never been skinny and have a poor digestive system. To be suggested that I should eat only one food item per day is offensive to me, as well as possibly dangerous. I have flat feet, weak ankles, and weak knees. Dancing in high heels, let alone walking, for more than one night a month is asking for trouble. Suggestions that I should get plastic surgery to increase chances of debut would probably cut in my self-esteem to the point it would be impossible to restore it. If I debuted, the fact that I grew up in a foreign society and can easily misunderstand and be misunderstood could definitely cut against the popularity that my career depends upon, and the anxiety of living with that would probably affect my health. Also considering that super long contracts are common, making my agency was treating me fairly would add on to my worries.  And this is assuming I even get through auditions or casted.  To me, all the hardships I described above aren't worth any of the fame. I also don't have a strong desire to be a singer, or the dream to be an artist. So, I have so much respect for Kpop Idols for braving such an arduous path to pursue their dreams. ",

Well I know full well all of the mistreatment trainees/artists go through in the industry but I love singing and dancing (recently found that out) and I just love a lot K-pop. I am looking forward to auditioning to at least 5 companies by the end of next year Why? So I get to practice singing,dancing, and rapping and I get to learn the basics of Korean language and manners. I believe I have an opportunity since I'm good at singing and improving very fast at dancing. I'm very quick at learning languages How do I know this? Well I am currently fluent in 2 languages and according to my mom and other people I became fluent in my second language in half a year or a year. \"My looks are nothing too special but If you put me in a group of good looking people I will catch someone's attention\" (This is said to me a lot by people I don't trust that a lot so I put that in quotes) My looks: Eyes: I have quite big eyes and my eyelashes are long (Even though I cut them when I was little so imagine how long my eyelashes were before). My eyebrows are quite thick but not that thick and actually they make my eyes look a little bit more big Nose: My nose is pointy kind of like BTS's Jungkook. It's not big but not to small either Lips: My lips are not that plump but still plump. They are quite small? I guess Face: My face is suppose to be round (according to my parents) but looks V shaped because I'm skinny Skin: Well I'm at the age when I start to get pimples but I haven't gotten much and the ones I got are not even visible so my skin looks smooth Body: I'm skinny and my body I would say is an hourglass shape? So you see I'm not out of normal good-looking So yes I want to become a K-pop artist (I don't call them idols). And even if I don't become a trainee/artist I will still have a good story to tell people but I won't give up so easily either. ",

I would not have passion I would only want to do it for the money. I can only do what I enjoy in my free time but how much free time would I have. It's not like I don't want to be a KPOP idol for the fame but it's something I would be passionate about. I have always enjoy singing and dancing and being on stage. Well I have liked attention too. I want to be someone others look up to. It's like your hobby is your job. You get paid to do what you enjoy! Others reasons why I want to be a Kpop Idol FameThe chances of maybe becoming richOpportunitiesExperiencesThe people you'll meetMaybe the companies can beautify you. Look at how many idols went from average looking to godlikeI know there is a bunch of cons like: ScandalHateNo privacyYou may not get paidYou may not get fameYou have to practice for long periodsYou will be judged cruelyWorst of all the effects on your health. Lack of sleep and food.You have to leave your familyEtc..But it's something I want to do. Everything comes at a price. You have to sacrifice something for something bigger. If you think \u201cthat's just dumb\" or \u201cyou'll never make it\" or \u201cstop daydreaming\u201d thank you. Those words will encourage me further. Though I am not super talented or super pretty. I still believe I have a chance. If you never try and already think you won't make it you will probably regret it. It's gonna be hard convincing my parents, passing audition, moving to a foreign country alone and dealing with all the stress. But I am still going to try and maybe who knows you may see me on stage one day. ",

            "answer_text": "Not at all. I love K-Pop. Unlike many Western artists, K-Pop idols are expected to be squeaky clean, and I'm not just talking about their appearances here. They have to be scandal-free, well-mannered, and more importantly, well-rounded. K-Pop idols are basically like a breeze of clear air amidst the stormy, scandalous Western artists. I really appreciate the works and efforts they need to invest in order to mold those traits. In a nutshell, K-Pop idols are meant to appeal as the ideal type of boyfriends/girlfriends you\u2019d like to have. But how much you'd have to sacrifice in order to get there? As a trainee, you're required to fulfill some strict trainings. You need to master at the very least one subject whether it's singing or rapping, but your dancing skill will still need to be above average because K-Pop idols are all about audiovisual. I do have some experiences with dancing, but I don't think I have enough drive to spend years of my life learning choreography. You will have to compete with your friends, until the company decides that you're good enough to debut. Even after you debut, the competition doesn't end there since you already have so many other extremely talented sunbaenims currently battling their way up into the top charts. Your personal life is very restricted as fans can be very obsessed with you; some might be crazy enough to become a Sasaeng. Sure, there are a few K-Pop Idols who are lucky enough to be able to date peacefully and even marry the person they love like BigBang (their fans are mostly older than most fans nowadays, so they're basically much more mature and open minded), but what if Kim Taehyung of BTS suddenly tells the ARMYs that he's engaged? His fiancee\u2019s life could be in danger, his whole career could meet an instant end. I don't think I can live in such environments. The K-Pop industry is a life that can only be endured by the people with exceptional skills and extreme determinations. I'd prefer to be here, writing answers on Quora, living a life of my own without anyone closely monitoring my activities, or a bunch of fans trying to get some close up photos of my face at the airports.

When I was 14 I was a trainee for a year or so and then I left. Trainee life is hard . I trained in dancing for 8 years and in singing for 7 years. I learnt korean in 3 months. There were 20 girls in one room I think. we had to get up at 5:00 am in the morning in breakfast we used to eat nothing except 2 sweet potato by 7 the trainees used to go to their school. My school gets over at 2:00pm and I reach at the company in an half hour or so . From 3:00 to 4:30 their were language classes which includes Japanese, Chinese and lastly korean(for non- Koreans ) then 15 min break from 4:45 to 6:45 there was gym and fitness classes after that 7:00 to 9:30 there were vocal classes and 9:45 to 12 was our dance classes. After that we used to eat dinner which was chicken breast and a low fat yogurt. The only snacks we were allowed to have was fruits. We weren\u2019t allowed to meet our parents. I also became extremely skinny and the company thought that I wasn\u2019t pretty enough to debut in their group ( not taking any names ) I had serve depression too and my mental health kept getting worse so I decide to leave the company well I am 16 now a year I left the company and I am now doing better. Here\u2019s my pic for the reference     Edit: Thank you so much for the upvotes \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\udc9c ",

I have a 3-octave stage range of E3#-A6 (D3-C7), along with suuper basic mediocre visuals, which can easily be transformed with the magic of a Korean makeup artist. I can probably be a decent lead vocalist, but a weak main vocal. However, becoming an idol is extremely difficult. have no dancing skills and underdeveloped rapping skills. my flow and breath control is good, but my tone is flat and cringe. also, I can\u2019t dance. Can barely do the body roll correctly. I dance worse than my Tiktoker friends. yeah\u2026.\ud83d\ude14 Alright, now take let's Look at The K-Beauty Standards. Double Eyelids: I have them, they\u2019re the in-out line double eyelids that are popular in south Korea rn Straight Eyebrows: I think I have this\u2026? V line Jaw: nope. I have dumpling cheeks. I\u2019m not complaining tho, all that baby fat will probably go away when I grow up. (I still won\u2019t have a v-line tho) Slim nose- nah. my nose is medium. Pale, Dewy Skin: I don\u2019t think so. I have fairly clear skin but it\u2019s slightly tanned. I have no problem with that, though. Small, Plump Lips: I don\u2019t think so. Mine are average. Fresh/Youthful Look: maybe..? Harmonious Features: I think I have this? My mom said that I do, but you be the judge.  (SNOW filter, no makeup)  (No filter, no makeup) (I usually don\u2019t take selfies that much but I was bored so I decided to take some photos lol) But In the end, I don\u2019t think being a kpop idol is for me. Trainee life is harsh and unrewarding. Being a lazy and rather sensitive person, I don\u2019t think I can handle that. I hope you enjoyed this answer. Bye~ \ud83c\udfa7 ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I really do, but at the same time, I really don\u2019t. i desperately want to get that kind of experience but if I debut, I\u2019m scared. Because I\u2019m not Asian, I\u2019m scared nobody will support me and people will tell me I\u2019m trying to be something I\u2019m not (Asian). I am not, nor have I ever been, a Koreaboo, or any kind of Asia-boo. I accept who I am and I\u2019m happy with it. Actually \u201cdo I want to be a K-pop idol\u201d is a question that\u2019s always in the back of my head. I think about it so much, it can be exhausting. It\u2019s a constant argument with myself. Reasons why I want to The first reason was I saw the friendships that K-pop idols had with each other and I want to experience it.Fansigns. I love the idea of hi-touch and meeting fansI think that training would be good for me and a good experienceI have the talent. I\u2019ve been singing all my life and I\u2019m really good at it. I\u2019ve also picked up rapping and I\u2019m decent at that as well. I\u2019m good at learning choreography but I\u2019m not that good at dancing and I\u2019m kind of stiff, but in terms of rapping and vocals I\u2019m good enough and I\u2019m not being arrogant, because I\u2019ve been told this on multiple occasionsI have the 4d personality and want to show people a \u201creal\u201d person in K-popI want to inspire peopleI love Korean language and want to experience itI want to live with my members, and I want to be so close to themI want people to admire me and look up to me and learn to accept me beyond my raceI\u2019m ready to work hardI\u2019m semi-fluent in Korean alreadyreasons why I don\u2019t want to I feel like nobody will support me, no matter how much talent and potential I haveI\u2019m scared that I won\u2019t end up being good enough because people will have such a high expectation of me if I\u2019m not asianI\u2019m scared that people will assume things like I\u2019m a koreabooThere\u2019s more but I want to wrap this up because I\u2019m so hungryyy lolabout me Yes, I am a white girl. I am 13 years old and I live in New Zealand. yes, I listen to K-pop and yes, I\u2019m learning Korean. And yes, I want to be a Kpop idol. But I don\u2019t want to be Korean. I don\u2019t want to be Asian. Yes, I feel sad occasionally because it\u2019d be so much easier for me if I was Asian and could achieve my dreams without as much backlash. But I don\u2019t want to be Asian. I want to show talent, become independent, inspire people, have fans, make lifelong friendships, improve my skills, debut in a group, perform my life away, and have fun whilst working among people I love. I want to experience those hardships and if those hardships are harder than they would be if I was Korean or Asian at all, then so be it. I\u2019ll work through them and work harder and become a better person. I am not a Koreaboo. A Koreaboo is someone who wants to be Korean. I don\u2019t want to be Korean. I want to be myself. Anyways\u2026 To sum it up, I want to be a K-pop idol, but I\u2019m scared that nobody would support me\u2026 yeah thanks for reading this far lmao ",

Compared to them, my face isn\u2019t as clear as them even if they have no makeup. My eyes are pretty small, and look like about two centimeter slits on my eyes. My nose is a little bigger than what fans would want it to be. My lips are probably the only things I actually like about my body in general. They are full lips, even though idols usually have small lips. Still love my lips~ <3 Dieting is also a thing that I would have to go through. I would rather die than not eat properly for 5 months. Anyways, I think that my body is fine just the way it is. But just in case I just lose my skinniness, I would have to be eating improperly. Also, training before you actually debut can be nerve-wracking. You can be cut even though you haven\u2019t even had a chance to debut in that company. The question is, would you really want to train 12 hours a day, and barely have enough sleep just because we didn\u2019t get this specific part right, so we have to train extra hours? You have to go through very strict critiques almost everyday. Being able to sing, rap, or dance is also something that you have to be pretty good at. You\u2019d be very lucky if you got accepted even if the only thing you\u2019re good at is standing there, no visuals, no skills, nothing. I wish life would be like that\u2026 Then I would\u2019ve been an idol a while ago, just doing nothing.. ;-; Technically, you would have to have the actual talent or visuals to be an idol. You\u2019d have to be able to pick up quickly, and fix it. The Korean language is also something you have to know. Studying the language would probably help you, and it\u2019ll be better if I were Korean. I don\u2019t know actually, to be honest, at this point, I\u2019m just being mean to myself. wE hAvE tO hAnDlE tHe PrEsSuRe ToO ",

And here\u2019s why: Im not Asian, nor do I speak KoreanPeople will scrutinize and dissect every little thing I do, from performing to just breathing.I could possibly lose my career for dating someone the fans don\u2019t approve of.When I used to perform, I couldn\u2019t sing solos, even just a few lines cause I had such bad stage fright. (Was forced to do it anyways).I have epileptic tremors and people would make fun of me for it. And my dancing would be very off-balanced.I utterly refuse to stoop down and do aegyo for people.I can\u2019t be myself. I have a persona that, if I stray from, fans will disapprove. (Ex. Jhope has a positive, funny persona, but in reality he\u2019s a pretty serious guy).I can\u2019t eat what I want. Even though I already have a fast metabolism, the company will probably force some crazy diet on me.I could possibly face abuse from the manager or company.I have to wear ridiculous stage outfits and hairstyles. And dance in high heels.I can\u2019t be alone and have little to no privacy. Fans/sasaengs are lurking around every corner.People will write smut about me.I have to pretend to like people.I just don\u2019t have the physical or emotional stamina to follow such an insane schedule.I could go on and on about why I don\u2019t want to be an idol. The only things I would enjoy are some of the theatrics, I\u2019d have cool friends, and I get to play fun variety show games. ",

            "answer_text": "Personally speaking, seeing how the life of a K-Pop idol is sometimes tempts me to drop my studies and train instead. More than usual though, I'm your average homebody with a passion for the arts in general, and seeing how broad and expansive and difficult their life would be, my mental health wouldn't take it. Being a K-Pop idol is different for everyone: you want to sing, or you want to dance, or you want to try out the concepts in groups, or even for more personal reasons. It takes a lot of training in at least 3 languages, vocal training, dancing, and monthly spiels/talents for showcases. I can also see there's a difficult seniority system and plausibly cultural differences to boot, and undeniably factions with other trainees. Pre-debut process by itself is like a double-edged life. There's also the uncertainty of whether you'll debut or get cut due to finances/etc. If I took the chance to audition for this, I have to guarantee my will to make something out of it is more than my constant disappointment at not being good enough for it. I have to constantly tell myself the long road is worth it for the stage I would hold for minutes, and just minutes to show that lengthy experience. Being a K-Pop idol also takes a lot of patience, because not everyone makes it big, and not everyone can handle promoting for a month in music shows, and it's a common path to hold busker events in populated areas to gain recognition for it. You might also be envious for an idol gaining fame from a viral video, or for any other thing that can happen. But when that sweet time comes, invitations for CFs and variety shows would pour, advertisements and radio show offers are in your reach, knowing there's a steady stream of fans in offical fancafes and seeing their comments is energizing. And like what my long-time favorite girl group has confessed for their tenth anniversary, they acknowledge that they wouldn't have made it this far without their fans, because ultimately, if they didn't have any, they'd be nothing. A lot of bad and good things can happen for someone to want to be a K-Pop idol. There's no generic reason for it (or at least, in my perspective), so here's my take on it. ",

            "answer_text": "There isn\u2019t much in good at. I\u2019m a performer in a family of scientists, doctors and lawyers because I\u2019m not smart. The only things I\u2019m good at are performing and helping people to feel better when they\u2019re struggling. I\u2019ve done a lot of thinking and I can\u2019t think of anything better suited for me than being a kpop idol. Why ??? I could easily stay in the UK being a backup dancer or on the West End doing plays or musicals, so why specifically a kpop idol ??? It\u2019s the influence they have mixed with the concepts. Looking at the less serious side I guess I\u2019d love to be a kpop idol for the fun choreography they do and the catchy songs they sing. You could have any concept from bubblegum pop to girl crush. I love all of it !!! Being able to do something and being proud of it is something\u2019s I\u2019ve always wanted. People don\u2019t take you seriously when you say you want to be a performer in the UK because it\u2019s an unstable and unpredictable job but honestly I don\u2019t care, I want to show that there is something I\u2019m good at and be proud of it. There\u2019s no happier time for me than being on stage with all of my friends. Next, the influence. I mentioned before that the only things I\u2019m good at are performing and I\u2019ve thought a lot of how I can help people feel better when performing and the only thing I can think of is a kpop idol. I could always be a singer here in the UK, but there are not a lot of chances to work in a group which is something I do better at, soloists are way more prominent but that\u2019s not what I want. Anyway, the West isn\u2019t into smol and cute girls like me so nobody would want me to be a solo singer in the UK because I don\u2019t fit their standards. I think being in a group suits me better as being surrounded by people makes my \u2018look after other people\u2019 instincts kick in, whether it\u2019s the people I\u2019m working with or the people that I\u2019m in front of. I want to be someone with influence so that I can be a positive influence to people and also be a source of comfort for others. Kpop idols have A LOT of influence over their fans who are very dedicated and I want to be able to use that to mine and other people\u2019s advantage. Another reason I\u2019d prefer to be in a group is because I\u2019m incredibly shy and being around people I trust brings out the best in me. I feel like I\u2019m being bigheaded and too hopeful in this post which isn\u2019t like me. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ll ever actually be a kpop idol anyway. I\u2019m probably too old at this point (2000 line) and I\u2019m only half Asian (Chinese/ English) so I\u2019m not actually hopeful at all. I guess I\u2019ll just stick with backup dancing instead.

            "answer_text": "Short answer: No. Long answer: Okay, let\u2019s take a look at a K-pop idol\u2019s life. First, trainee years: Trainees usually train for at least 2 years before they debut. Some may even extend up to 7 years. They\u2019ll work very hard to improve their singing, dancing or rapping skills. Not only that, some idols are forced to go to unhealthy diet to achieve perfect bodies, which often results to idols fainting on stage and the like. After they debut: Okay, so you have debuted, and you received thousands of love and recognition for your talent. Cool. But no matter how talented you are, you cannot please everybody, and even if you\u2019re not doing anything bad, you will still gain hate from other people, who usually eventually become anti fans. From what I observed since I entered the K-pop world, K-pop fans/anti fans are crazier than normal fans. In South Korean culture, we have sasaengs. Sasaengs are fans (though I don\u2019t really classify them as fans) who are crazily (literally) obsessed with their idols that they will do whatever it takes to get noticed by their idols. Common examples of sasaeng activities are invading their idol\u2019s privacy e.g. breaking into their house and stealing their personal properties and in some cases, putting up a secret recorder, tracking their cars, sending them blood-written letters, etc. Is that something I would want to happen to me as a K-pop star? NO. Another thing: schedules. K-pop stars\u2019 schedules are so hectic that some barely get enough rest and suffer of sleep deprivation. Some agencies also tend to overwork their idols and do not prioritize their health coughSMcough, resulting to idols fainting or attaining injuries (usually leg injuries). And even if you have injuries, that doesn\u2019t exempt you from performing on stage (e.g. EXO). Thankfully BigHit takes care of their idols well. Let\u2019s not forget that there are other agencies which are left in a huge debt when their idols aren\u2019t as successful as they hope so, and eventually end up disbanding the group. Hip hop girl group The Ark is an example, which is too bad because they were unlike any other girl group. So these are just some of the reasons why I wouldn\u2019t want to be a K-pop star. I could add more to the list but it would get too long. ",

            "answer_text": "A big reason is a passion for music or dance and for performing- getting to be on stage, hear the audience screaming, getting to convey your message to thousands of people and be recognized. After all, people spend years training in music and dancing under difficult conditions, and though everything else that comes with being an idol (like variety shows, acting, modeling, etc.) may also be part of their goal, if they didn\u2019t have the passion for music and dance, they wouldn\u2019t have made it through those years of training. Another major reason is that idols are able to reach lots of people through things other than music, such as variety shows, acting, vlives, etc. Being an idol is more than just singing and dancing- a lot of it is about fan interaction. And personally, watching kpop idols never fails to make me laugh- their personalities are a huge part of idol life, and they are really funny and kind and overall great people who make other people happy. And if you\u2019re a kpop idol, you also have the opportunity to make people happy, and I think that\u2019s pretty great. A simpler reason is just that people want to be famous. People want to do something with their life that is recognized by other people and want to die having left their mark on the world. Another simple reason is just that it looks fun- at least on screen. It\u2019s easy to get drawn in by their compelling lifestyles and charming personalities, and though there are dark sides to idol life and kpop, for the most part idols are happy with their lives and their jobs. (Or at the very least, they look happy.) So you see someone on screen who is happy, doing what they want to do in life, with the same passion for music as you do, and you think \u201cWow, I want to be like them\u201d, because at the end of the day, people want to be happy. This next reason pertains mostly to people living in Korea, though I\u2019m not an expert on Korean culture, so please correct me if there are any inaccuracies. But basically, what I\u2019ve heard is that everything in Korea is very competitive in terms of school and extracurriculars and whatever else they do. Most people, after they go to school, will then go to extra school in order to get ahead of everyone else (except everyone does this, so basically it\u2019s a race to see who can prep the most. Prep classes are also part of the culture among Asian Americans as well, but it\u2019s a lot bigger in Korea.) So everyone is working really hard to get ahead of everyone else, people who are working just as hard as them and putting in just as much extra time and effort. So though training to be a kpop idol is really hard, going the traditional school route isn\u2019t that much better. (Though it probably is easier, as you only have one thing to focus on whereas trainees have to train and continue to keep up with their schoolwork at the same time.) So if you know you\u2019re really passionate about music or dancing, why would you want to spend so much time and effort on school when you could just become a trainee? Yeah, it\u2019s a more difficult life, but it gets you out of the school track and lets you pursue what you\u2019re passionate about, so it\u2019s not a bad tradeoff. Another point is specifically pertaining to kpop idols who came from the US. Due to stereotypes it\u2019s pretty hard for Asian American artists to be popular in America. And even if they were popular, I feel like they\u2019d also be the butt of a lot of \u201cAsian\u201d jokes. A lot of people would see them more for their ethnicity than for their music (like \u201cwow! an Asian artist! how unusual!\u201d) and attribute some of their success to their ethnicity. And that feeling sucks, honestly. I wouldn\u2019t want to live with that feeling hanging over my head all the time. But in Korea, even though they might not completely fit in, foreign idols are pretty common and other people wouldn\u2019t see them as anything particularly unusual. Of course, there are a million other reasons why someone would want to be a kpop idol, but I think these are the major ones. ",

I mean, you\u2019re probably going to be known all over the world, fame will always be with you, you\u2019ll have a blast at concerts and promoting and you\u2019d dancing and singing to your heart\u2019s content! Em no. For all of you fans, you could be passionate for dancing or singing or you could just be deluded, but really you need to see how hard it is to be an idol. It takes a lot of mental strength, physically endurance and most importantly the will of iron. It takes so much dedication and you have to pour your blood, sweat and tears into all you practice to hone your skills, just to show your potential to managers. Dieting will be common and it\u2019ll be harsh to the point you\u2019ll faint in the middle of practice. They\u2019ll groom you until you\u2019re close to the beauty standards of Korea. Dancing until your legs give up and you\u2019re sweating buckets. Singing and rapping until your voice goes hoarse. All of these situations could happen and are quite commonly heard from ex-trainees. I\u2019ve seen some young teenagers who are completely engrossed in the world of K-POP and really want to be an idol but they\u2019ve completely ignored the suffering and misery that you\u2019d suffer from being a trainee. Hopefully these kids will grow up and expand their horizons and truly see the outlook of the many retired trainees and see why they gave up. To the bottom line, being a trainee is not rainbows and unicorns all day, it\u2019s renowned for the rigorous and demanding training that people tend to overlook. It\u2019s not for the faint hearted.

            "answer_text": "As opposed as what other answers have said, Yes I want to be a Kpop star. I\u2019m actually getting ready to audition for a few companies soon. While I do agree with what Christin said, I believe all the things they go through are very essential to be good at what you do (the only thing I don't think is right is the crazy diets, like the one where you eat only one food two times a day, not all diets, and the idols not getting enough sleep). The training makes it so that all the stages they do in the future are perfect, or near it. And I don't think the training part is bad at all. I believe that if the person can't train for a long time, gets bored, or just wants to quit, they aren't truly passionate about what they do. For example, actors have to learn the script, practice a lot and perfect it before recording or performing it, and thats just for one movie/scene/play, so it would make sense for idols to work so hard in training since they will have to do it way more than once. But even with all the negative aspects of Kpop I would like to be a idol (or even just be a trainee), since I really love the way Korean language sounds when sung and rapped, my passion is dance, and I always wanted to be a singer, so the perfect way for all three to come together is Kpop.

I play the violin so yes, I really do enjoy music. That\u2019s another reason why I would\u2019ve said yes. I have a passion for dance and singing and thought, hey being a kpop star sounds like a dream job. But all the struggle to become a kpop idol is a bit too much for my taste. I\u2019m naturally skinny (but not super star skinny) so dieting wouldn\u2019t be too much of a problem but my face doesn\u2019t fit \u201ckorean beauty standards\u201d. I don\u2019t want to have my face completely change just so I can \u201clook\u201d the part. Also, another problem is age. The prime age for having a chance to become a kpop idol is 15\u201325. There are people young as 7 years old that start training, in hopes that they will debut and become successful. If I were to audition, I would have to be older than 18 because I want to continue and finish high school. If I\u2019m lucky enough and pass auditions at 18, I would have to wait 2+ years before I can debut. But that\u2019s a big IF. There are some trainees that train for so long but never debut. I don\u2019t want to take that chance. The only reason I would say yes is because I would love to perform on stage, singing and dancing my own song. But I realized I don\u2019t have to do be a kpop idol to do that. Or maybe I should just find another stable career and leave music as a hobby of mine. ",

I love singing a lot, too. I've always dreamt of being on stage, performing with fellow teammates, and having an audience, even before I knew about kpop. Dancing is fun too, even though I've never professionally learnt it, I love learning dances and dancing on beat is so satisfying. Rapping is so satisfying for me too, I love spitting out the words that want to come out, in quick speed, and when I succeed in rapping an especially quick verse, I feel so happy. I've researched all about idols and trainees. I know there is a lot of backlash, dark sides, sasaengs, fake fans, malicious comments, pressure, non-stop practicing, leaving my family and everything I've got right now. I know. Yet I still long for the stage. I will do anything in order to go on stage. I am willing to. It's the only thing that keeps me going most of the times. It's the worst dream anyone could have. I don't want my dream, it's so impractical. Yet I long for it. So I work for it. I sing every day, practicing my vocals. I dance every day, even though my room is tiny and I can't dance most dances without bumping my feet and arms. I rap every day, improving my flow and rhythm, and I try tongue twisters and speaking quickly. It's a dangerous dream but to me, it's so satisfying, I love music. It's my passion. I love putting my feelings into a universal language. So do I want to be a kpop idol? Yes. (oh and I'd like to meet Pentagon and tell them how much they inspire me,,, but that doesnt sound that cool hehe) ",

            "answer_text": "Once upon a time, I did. I'm still occasionally tempted, but I know I will never follow through with it. Everyone on this thread has talked about the dark sides of the industry. The self harm, the eating disorders, the harsh words of keyboard warriors, and lack of mental health support. I will bring a different perspective. You may never see your family until a few years. Especially from a foreigner trainee's standpoint. If that's your case, slim down that chance to almost none, unless you become extremely famous (ex: BLACKPINK's Lisa), but that almost never happens. For example, Mark from NCT said one time that he hasn't visited his family in years. He went at least four years without going home to Canada. Think about it. You will never get to see your little sibling grow up, or your older sibling go to college or get married. You will become a stranger to your extended family because you never attend family gatherings anymore. Your grandparents may pass, and you'll never get the chance to say goodbye. And most importantly, your parents will never see you for years. Do you think they can handle that? Can you handle being away in another country without ever being able to see them? Not being able to talk to them? Being a trainee is so busy, that you won't often be able to call or text them. You must also take time zones into consideration. Is it fair to rarely call your parents unless it's 3AM in the morning for them? Besides, if you're unlucky enough, that might not even be an option for you. Some companies never allow trainees to own a phone. Additionally, when your parents get old, you'll never be able to take care of them the way they deserve to be cared for. If you're not close with your family, think about your friends. Once again, if you don't live in Seoul, you might as well kiss your best friend goodbye. You'll never see them ever again. Friendships almost never survive if you're not living in close areas. Your friend group will learn to forget about you and move on. Truthfully, almost no teenager (I'm assuming most aspiring idols are in this age group) would be willing to stay long distance friends with you. Or alternatively, if they do, your friendship will not remain exactly the way it was before you left to become a trainee. How could it? I'm sure if the roles were reversed and they were the one who left, you would act just as distant. You won't be able to laugh and talk behind the back of your annoying history teacher with your classmates. You'd be in another country, in another school. You'd be training for at least ten hours. Adding your hours of study to that, and you'd have almost no time for sleep. How could you possibly be energetic enough in the morning to befriend your classmates? Additionally, if you have a language barrier because you don't speak Korean, you might not be able to make friends anyway. If you do, is there even a point in making friends? You'll be training the moment class ends. There's no time to hang out, go shopping or eat out with friends like a regular teenager. In conclusion, making the decision to become a trainee is a lot more selfish than you realize. I hope anyone who considers going into the industry considers these points. Thanks for reading. ",

They\u2019re mostly negative about the stress(I\u2019ve survived an all girls boarding school so I think I can handle it). Then there\u2019s also the possibility of working your butt off,going through hell only to not debut or to debut but no one knows you. Ever heard of TopDog?? They\u2019re great but they\u2019ve got a rubbish company that doesn\u2019t really promote them or anything. But anyway, WHY would you want to be an idol? A lot of people, again, have different reasons. For example, I think it was Sunmi who did it for money for her dad. Oh, and BTS\u2019s V\u2019s parents knew he had talent so sent him away from their farm, just like BlackPink\u2019s Ros\u00e9\u2019s dad flew to the other side of Australia. Me? I\u2019ve always loved to perform. I was a very hyperactive kid which is where I got my love for dance (and I\u2019m pretty good too:) I\u2019m really good at rapping too and I\u2019m great at improv and acting. I\u2019m also kinda pretty in a modest way. I\u2019m Asian but not East Asian. (I\u2019m Pakistani although with my fair skin and almond eyes I\u2019ve never really looked West Asian.)Plus I have natural double eyelids!(bonus! Koreans literally get plastic surgery for them so for everyone else who has them high five!) I\u2019m also quite tall for my age. But even if you DO want to be an idol, do they want you\u2026? ",

Is basically like selling your soul to someone that will change everything you are just because. Well now I say (and sorry for the bad word) f*ck asian beauty standards, they overwork those poor people to entertain us, we wish to be like them but at what cost? The beauty of this generation is that we can share whatever make us happy on the social media. We can record ourselves singing and dancing, we can show ourselves to the world, what we eat, how we practice, what we do, act like them without the pressure of some CEO trying to make us look as perfect as possible. Talk to your friends, make some international friends, create a k-pop or c-pop or j-pop group and just do it, share your happines on social media, forget about how you look, you could be brown and chubby, like me, you can be tall or short, you can have great dancing skills or poor dancing skills, you can sing like a god or just scream, the point is HAVE FUN. Create something beautiful, yes, maybe is not as professional as you wanted, but maybe it\u2019ll be better. I don't know, think about it. ",

And I can even self-compose and produce my own songs if I try hard enough and have the facilities I need. Visuals-wise, I\u2019m still working on that. Well, it\u2019s just that my beauty is average and my face is nothing compared to modern goddesses in this era and I\u2019m not that tall either but I\u2019d still like to think I\u2019d be accepted in a few good companies for my other aspects. Maintenance-wise, strict diet is no problem for me. I can take it not eating for a whole month or eating a month\u2019s worth in one sitting and not gain any weight. I wouldn\u2019t mind having to extend my training period and debuting late because it would still benefit me either way \u2014 I\u2019d still be able to create the best version of myself, talent and all.

Second, you have to join one of entertainment company, such as YG, JYP, SM, FNC, etc. You can go through audition there because I heard they auditioned regularly to recruit new members. maybe each year, or month, I\u2019m not sure about that. Third, you have to become the trainee. All idols say that trainee is the most hard time for them. For some companies, you didnt receive any fee, or anything. You have to practice and practice every day, usually company will evaluate you regularly. If there\u2019s no significant improvement, then you can get fired as a trainee. If you succeed and will debut very soon, remember that maybe for your first year, you still won\u2019t receive any money because you have to payback the company for all the money that the company spent when you were a trainee. Not to mention that there are many rules and \u2018how to play\u2019 in Entertainment Industry in Korea. Make sure you\u2019re ready enough. ",

I mean just look at this.  If you couldn\u2019t tell I was being sarcastic. I have double eyelids ,small plump lips, large eyes, nice hair but that\u2019s probably it. I don\u2019t actually fit the visual standards too well if I\u2019m being honest. I am asian but I\u2019m of Southern Asian ethnicity. I consider myself a very realistic and mature person so I know that chances of me debuting are very small. I already know about hate and criticism that I will get if ever debut. I do think that I might already have a few mental health problems as of now. My parents are probably also going to be very against it. So that\u2019s why I want to wait until I\u2019m somewhere in my late teens. By then I hope to have lost weight and improved my skills enough or to have given up on my dreams. Which ever one happens to come first I guess. Anyways stay safe and I hope that you guys have an absolutely wonderful and amazing day. Byeeeee <3! ",

            "answer_text": "Fame, money, and glory. They think being an idol is easy and fun. What many don\u2019t know is that becoming an idol is actually an extremely stressful process that includes extreme dieting, non-stop practice, no free time, and a contract that often makes it extremely difficult to earn any money for yourself. There are many challenges: Physically, you must fit height requirements, have no excess fat at all, be good-looking, and must be East Asian.Talent wise, you must have a strong dancing background and either sing or rap well to even audition.If you pass auditions, you become a trainee, meaning you don\u2019t get to see your friends and family anymore, and your entire live revolves around dancing, singing/rapping, working out, dieting, and taking Korean lessons if you don\u2019t speak Korean.Trainees often fall into depression or give up partway through because of the difficult lifestyle. Even if you endure, it usually takes several years before you debut in a group.Even if you debut, it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll hit fame at all, unless you come from SM, YG, or JYP Ent (the big 3 companies). But in that case, you\u2019ll have a horrible contract that doesn\u2019t let you make money and a company that treats you like a tool and not a person.Whether or not your group becomes famous, the first few years of having no fans will be physically and emotionally taxing. When you do become famous, you become richer, but physically, it gets even harder.Famous idols must always stay fit and often go on diets. They also travel all the time for tours and shows, and rarely get breaks. Often, they go on only a few hours of sleep before performing for hours on stage.",

But to me it seems not realistic, and people say to make your goals and dreams realistic\u2026 Ever since I got interested in kpop industry, I became in love with singing and dancing. And surprisingly I\u2019m good at both\u2026 According to my friends and mom\u2026. I am aware that there\u2019s dark sides to the industry but I\u2019m willing to take risks. I even talked about the \u2018What if\u2019s\u2019 questions to my mom. And yet, as mom\u2019s do, they always find a way\u2026. Me: But if I join the kpop industry, what if I can\u2019t see you anymore? Mom: Then I\u2019ll go to every concert you have and we could Skype or FaceTime Samething with my friends\u2026 Me: What would you do if I joined the kpop industry and left to South Korea? Friends: We would stan you and watch every video. Possibly watch a concert of yours? I\u2019m honestly grateful to have these people surrounding my life but like I said, I don\u2019t have the guts to audition :// A main problem is that my mom doesn\u2019t want me to do surgery. But some people say that it depends on what you look like\u2026 If I did audition and make it in, I\u2019d probably need to fix my nose so heh\u2026. Welp I really want to become a kpop idol and maybe someday I can be that girl who\u2019s parents are proud of not just proud of their son, but also me too.

My Visuals are okay but I\u2019m still 13 so I haven\u2019t fully matured yet. my dance has been good ish; I can pull of many dances I\u2019m just scared that it\u2019ll look awkward cause I\u2019m 5\u20192! to any one also wanting the life of an idol, I believe we all need to understand that a lot of bad things comes with being an famous and we need to be ready for that, but for now keep your head up!

            "answer_text": "yes, i would and i do. a lot of the comments on here are totally understandable regarding the mistreatment that idols go through and the fact that sometimes it's all for naught. i have considered this and thought long and hard about it and have decided that despite this, i'm going for it. i know full well that i could try and make it in the western music industry, and it would probably be easier, but i've always really felt at a disconnect with it. i've never had an american music artist get to me in a way that kpop has. kpop really does means something to me unlike anything in the western music industry. i'm fully aware of the abuse and mistreatment that idols go through. i realise that because of my race (indonesian and indian), i have little to no chance of getting into any company, let alone one that will actually treat me like a human being. but it's worth a try. i can really only benefit from auditioning for a company. the main reason why i really would like to be a kpop idol is simply because i've seen the impact they have on people. how happy they can make people. i've always wanted to do that, wanted to help people to feel happy, good about themselves, put a smile on their face. that's all i've ever wanted to do. and being on my school's dance team, i discovered my love for performing. i can confidently say i have a decent voice, as singing has been my passion all my life, and i can rap well despite not having the most experience in it. people have always told me that i should go for a singing career; i'm finally indulging. so, yes, i want to be a kpop idol. is it guaranteed that i will? no. is it guaranteed that i'll make it through training the same person mentally as i was before? no. is it guaranteed that i'll be treated right by my company and by korea as a whole? definitely not. but really, what's life without some risks?

            "answer_text": "To be honest, while I do have a couple of reasons, there is one that is the most important to me. My number one reason is because of the positive effects it has had on my life. Before K-pop I hated being asian (I\u2019m korean and Vietnamese) and I would wish I was white. It really bothered me and looking back I feel silly. It started going downhill. I had become very sad due to a number of reasons. I didn\u2019t want to eat. I didn\u2019t want to do anything. Once I started listening to their music and following groups, I became happier. They paint this perfect picture, one that made me happy and caused me to look at life a different way. And though they obviously had flaws, they were joyful and happy. I want to become an idol because I would want to be able to help someone like they have helped me. ",

            "answer_text": "I like Kpop music and I admire many Kpop stars, but I would never want to be a Kpop star, even if I was good at singing and dancing. Most Kpop companies tie their trainees and musicians to slave contracts, stripping them of their musical and personal freedom. Many trainees even sign 7\u201310 year contracts but never debut or accomplish their dreams, so signing with an entertainment company basically means gambling your future. Balancing schoolwork, training, and taking language lessons is more than the average human being can handle. Even if some groups make it to the end and debut, they\u2019re not guaranteed success. The Kpop industry has grown more and more competitive since its peak in the 2000s, and only the best of the best have chances of making it big within a tough place. A lot of groups aren\u2019t even given the freedom to write or compose their own songs. They\u2019re just fed songs by the company, and have to perform like machines, simply for money to keep the business going. In fact, most companies don\u2019t even pay their artists or let them contact their families until their first music show win. It may look fun, watching your favorite groups perform, but underneath their charismatic exteriors lies lost hours of sleeping and eating, and drained souls who can\u2019t live a normal life, away from the spotlight where every one of your actions is targeted by paparazzi and malicious netizens.

There's a glamorous and dazzling career we see when we look at kpop artists, and that makes everybody wants to be like them. What we usually don't realize or take into account is the price we'd have to pay to become a part in it. And the risk. Like all entertainment industry, there's a dark side to kpop. One that, no matter how passionate you are about singin/dancing/etc, can catch you so off guard and ruin all that you love. You get a lot of love if you debut, but the hate is judging and unforgiving. I wanted to be a kpop artist. An acquaintance of my mothers told me no. I asked why. She said, there are unmentionable things done to girls there. Not all, but some. It'd be hard pressed to know exactly which agency is clean, which people is true, and which ones to keep away from. Now, in March 2019, I remember my mother's acquaintance and thanked her. I would've been a naive foreign girl alone in a strange place with no safety net easily lured in by kind faces. ",

So I'm fluent in both Korean and English. I'm 12 now. I kinda fit the Korean beauty standards. And I'm decent at singing and dancing. So maybe. If im lucky, i can pass but it's up to the company. ",

Besides, I\u2019d hate to keep up a fake perfect image of myself in public. Regardless of the fact that trainee life is harsh and that it doesn\u2019t get any easier after debut, think about what you would do after your group disbands. (Because no group will keep going into their 50s. There are younger idols who could easily replace them.) Career options seem pretty limited, especially if you\u2019re not super well known or extremely talented. Not everyone can be a decently popular model or actor, and the chances are even slimmer for someone who\u2019s older and/or doesn\u2019t fit the mold as well. I could be totally wrong, however, since the members of kpop\u2019s 2nd generation are just starting to wrap up their idol activities (Girls Generation, Big Bang, Wonder Girls\u2026) and get jobs outside of the idol sphere. But with what k-entertainment currently has, it seems near impossible that all the mainstream kpop idols in existence will continue their careers in k-entertainment after they finish idol activities.

            "answer_text": "No, for various reasons. The chances of you debuting is very small. You may end up spending years as a trainee only to not debut. As you grow older, your chances of joining the debut group becomes slimmer and if you don\u2019t make the team then while you decide on a new career, your peers have already graduated college and secured stable jobs.Many trainees are treated poorly and exploited. You need maintain your weight and that often involved unhealthy dieting to keep your figure.If you aren\u2019t Korean, you need to learn a new language, move to a new country, learn and adapt to a different culture, and accept the fact that you will be paid less if you do debut compared to your Korean members although that may change in the future as people are fighting for equal pay for foreign members.Money - unless you are super successful like Big Bang, SNSD, or BoA to name a few, you probably won\u2019t be making much\u2026if any. The company takes a large portion of your pay. Yoona debuted with SNSD a year before Justin Bieber. Her net worth is about $11 million compared to Justin\u2019s $265 million. Yeonwoo from Momoland recently said in a show that the group still hasn\u2019t made any money yet because they are still paying back the debt they accrued as trainees and they\u2019ve debuted for a little over two years now.The list could go on, but I\u2019m going to stop here.

I would love to become a K-pop idol Blackpink was the first K-pop group I whose songs I ever listened to and I really enjoyed it however I never actually thought about being a K-pop idol until I got interested in different groups such as: BTS, Twice, EXO, GOT7 and Momoland. I started thinking a lot if I wanted to become a K-pop Idol, my mum preferred me to just be a singer while my dad thought it would be a better idea to be a doctor or dentist. However I never listened to them, I still wanted to be a K-pop Idol. Then everyday I would practice singing, dancing and Korean. at any time I could. About 2 years later (age 14) I learned to speak Korean. I was really happy and I thought that I could become a K-pop Idol As I could: 1: Speak Korean 2: Sing and Dance decently 3. I am quite good looking The only thing that worried me was that I was not Korean (I\u2019m Japanese) and I\u2019m usually quite scared to perform on stage. This did not stop me though. I auditioned for some companies and luckily I got into one of them it was a miracle! Like a dream come true. I really hope I debut and be a K-pop idol. ",

But I've heard so many idols saying they were tone deaf and I was thinking that I could take singing lessons too. I am also not Asian and from Europe, but I still didn't care because there are idols that are not even Asian. After all these ideas that went through my head I researched what kind of contract you got to sign. I know it depends on the label but they usually have some similar terms. Most of the labels are pretty controlling\u2026because it's actually pretty hard to make some teenagers be popular and disciplined and I understood this but I didn't like listening to my parents, hell no I'm not going to listen to a label who tells me when I should go out and when I shouldn't lol. So before you think about being an idol take EVERY LITTLE THING in consideration and if you still want to go down this route there are a lot of YouTubers who are doing videos based on becoming and being an idol.

My grandmother sang, my dad sings and plays 2 instruments and has been in multiple (small) music groups throughout my life, and my sisters and I can sing and play at least one instrument. At one point in my life, I had severe depression and nearly attempted suicide, and music was always my way of coping. I never really clicked with the music in my country, or with my country. As stereotypical as it sounds, I\u2019ve always felt like the weird person who doesn\u2019t belong here, and I have actually been told by my own teacher before that I look like I\u2019m not meant to stay here, like I\u2019m supposed to be somewhere else and do something else. Yes, I am aware of all the risks that come with an idol, including the overworking, dieting, sasaengs, haters/antis, and everything else. Everything in life comes with a risk, so there will always be some danger in my life whether I actually try to become an idol or not. I\u2019ve actually submitted an audition via email to Big Hit Entertainment, although I know that I won\u2019t make it. I\u2019m going to try to audition for other companies in the future, but I\u2019m also trying to work on learning Korean and doing K-POP covers of songs and choreography at the moment. ",

To be selected as a trainee at these companies, there are some ways. We have several audition TV shows from different broadcast stations such as \u2018Produce101\u2019 from Mnet, \u2018Kpop star\u2019 from SBS, \u2018Superstar K\u2019, \u2018Show me the money\u2019 from Mnet, and I am sure more audition programs will be made. Once you get a spotlight on your talent in that show, judges who are from these companies, will select you as a their trainee. Besides, there are some local auditions too periodically. Visit there website(SMTOWN), there are weekly, monthly auditions even in Japan and USA. These top companies and also other famous companies(Cube, Loen, Jellyfish) have well-made training systems that they have experienced instructors to teach them to sing, dance, act, and all attitudes to be a Kpop star. Their trainees normally spend 3 or more than 5 years to learn and finally can debut. Considering your talent, personality, age, nationality and leadership, you can be a member of a group or solo. Being a Kpop idol is very unique, which is not made by themselves, always big entertainment companies are involved. Compared to singer-songwriters, Kpop idols are not only sining and dancing with songs they make, but they come with perfect choreography, bold & colorful music video, nicely conceptualized theme, and costume. This formula makes the Kpop idol as a big music commodity. These days, there are many ways to show their talent thanks to youtube, personal broadcasting through instagram, you can make your own spotlight. That will be an other way to be selected and debut, but it is hard to imagine to become a Kpop idol without big agencies. ",

So in the end I decided hey once I get to the weight I want to be I\u2019ll start auditioning (I mean sure my BMI is 17 which is technically underweight there are a few things I need to work on).

It\u2019s hard work and the business is shady at times, there\u2019s no denying that. But despite all the hardships, I still thought \u201cthis could be your way into music\u201d. But I\u2019m not a person that would do well on a stage. I don\u2019t like the attention, as simple as that. I dislike the spotlight. I would do much better as a manager or behind the stage, always have been much better behind the stage than on it. So while the hardships are an honest reason to consider twice or thrice or - hell, ten times - it is not really the reason to my no. No, I wouldn\u2019t want to be a kpop idol. But I would very much like to work in the business - behind the scene. ",

I\u2019ve never wanted to be a K-pop star, even from the time I first started getting into K-pop. Firstly, I\u2019m artistically talented, not musically talented, and I can barely stand in front of my class and present my project to them. I\u2019d probably faint if I was on stage. Secondly, it\u2019s really hard to learn a new language. I know this because it took me more than a decade to learn English. Besides, K-pop can be more of a curse than a blessing. Even if you make it big, which is already unlikely enough, you still have to deal with all the stress and work. Idols have stated that the average idol only gets 1\u20134 hours of sleep. And if you are a very well-managed person, then think about this: idols have some basic human rights taken away from them, such as bans on dating, bans on what you eat, slave contracts, bans on seeing your family, forced plastic surgery, etc. It can be too much for some people, point: Jonghyun of SHINee. I respect those who can go through all that, but I definitely wouldn\u2019t wish that lifestyle on anyone. ",

I don\u2019t think becoming a kpop idol is in any way easy either. Their weight and skill requirements for kpop trainees are insane. But I would still love the chance to go through that even if I know its not healthy and would probably end up as nothing because I love music and dance and I\u2019d really love to become famous for those things. Also, being a kpop idol means that you can make art which touches and impacts so many people. You have a platform to support people and make their lives better and so many idols use it well (though some don\u2019t but hopefully I wouldn\u2019t be like any of them). I think being an idol is a really impressive thing because of the work it takes to become one and the responsibility it requires to be one. And yes I\u2019d like to be in that place. I\u2019d want to make music that people across the world are impressed by and have people who support what I put time into and love. ",

If you are dark skin,talented,and fluent in korean you have a chance but its really low because you're skin is dark , it doesn't seem fair i know its because of the korean beauty standards * pale skin, slim body*. If you're white (not being racist) talented,fluent in korean then you have a chance and its higher than a dark skin's person chance. Talented. Light skin. Korean speaker. You have a chance. But im not saying if your dark skin you just have to give up you can again until it happens. Hope that helps:) ",

I have lack of vocal skills but I\u2019m into rapping so Ig I don\u2019t mind becoming a korean rapper. I\u2019m super anti social, extremely quiet even now, but I\u2019ve been perform on stage before. Dancing became one of my favorite hobbies when I was 11. I don\u2019t want people laugh or judging me just bc I want to become a kpop idol. I wanted to become a kpop idol because they inspired me to let myself out and wanted to start a new life without facing anxieties. I just wanted to show the world who I am, from a quiet, shy person to a confident kpop idol. My parents, I highly doubt they\u2019re going to let me achieve my dreams. Fame, money is not what I\u2019m looking for but to have a singing from heart to heart for people around the world ",

Last year I passed an online audition at a quite big company but I couldn't fly to Korea at the time. I would say that I have some korean Beauty Features. I don't want to become an Idol to meet the Idols. It would be really cool, but it's not important for me. I want to become an Idol, because I want to make the people Happy with my music. I will Fight for my dream and will mit give up! And If you want to become an Idol than so Something for it. If you so nothing than nothing will happen. Work for your dream! ",

            "answer_text": "LOL I mean who doesn\u2019t? I do want to become a K-Pop idol. I\u2019ve had experience in both singing and dancing. And a lot of people told me I look attractive, though I don\u2019t know what kind of crack they were on when they said that LMAO. But it takes a lot of work and some resources to get to that point. Work I can definitely put in, but I don\u2019t have the resources to get there. And the K-Pop industry is like a whole pack of wolves at bay. It\u2019s unpredictable and your contract with a company could end just like that. And since I\u2019m a foreigner, a Chinese-American, I don\u2019t think I would make it. Not to mention that mental stress that idols get from Netizens. I mean I\u2019ve been through some crappy stuff already, so I think I\u2019ll have thicker skin than other trainees who never had that kind of exposure. But I would be still a bit afraid of what people think of me. I think I would just shrug it off a little easier. I mean who cares, it\u2019s just people who are behind their screens taking out their insecurities on someone else who had far more success than they had. If I ever got to that point though I would probably be just a solo singer/song-writer for other groups. If I got farther I would perhaps be in the next biggest girl group. But for now, I can only daydream about my other self who is living her dream as an artist. ",

            "answer_text": "Mostly teenagers dream to be Kpop idols. They just want to be famous, beautiful and have a large fanbase. They just want the success, not the hard work which results this. We only see the fun side of being a kpop idol . It looks that they have an amazing rich lifestyle which everyone wants to enjoy. But who knows what's the reality behind this? The reality is harsh. It is unbelievable that some kpop idols only get 4 hours of sleep and spend the rest of the day in practicing, exercising etc. They have no social life. They are caged birds with zero freedom. They can't even eat what they want. Even after shedding blood,sweat and tears, what they actually get? Criticism, harsh comments, rude behaviour from the company. Even the revenue they earn ;at first the company and staffs receives and then a proportion goes to the kpop idols. I really salute all the kpop idols there who are just compromising so much for the sake of their family. However even after knowing this, I don't know why people want to be Kpop idols. But if they truly believe they can be, then there is no harm to wish to be a kpop idol. ",

I have low expectations to get accepted but I am willing to take lots of prep time until I feel ready and confident; I know it\u2019ll be worth it to experience the audition process. If I ever do become a Kpop idol, I really don\u2019t have much expectations of being on the top charts because everything is all about competition. To answer your question, yeah I do want to be a Kpop idol, only if I pursue it as a career that is. ",

I\u2019m not the type of person who dreams of being on stage, though I can agree that it looks cool sometimes. And I think that if I want money, fame, etc. in the future, it can be earned in other ways. Besides, I consider myself realistic. I know my limits and that I have no particular talents in singing, dancing, or rapping. I\u2019m also not hardworking or resilient enough to go through extensive training. Shows like Produce 101 and Idol School show just how hard it is to be a trainee, and knowing me I\u2019d quit very quickly. ",

I did want to be one when I was younger because of people like Hyuna, BoA, G-Dragon, Taemin, etc. I think my main reason is that I don\u2019t want to be bullied into losing weight like Kyla from Pristin. I\u2019m not fat (neither was she!!!!!!!! She was 15(?) It\u2019s called baby weight that goes away over time), I\u2019m muscular for a girl because of how much I work out plus my diet. I would in no way cut out how much I workout to please other peoples opinions of me, you either like me or don\u2019t. My weight and looks shouldn\u2019t affect that opinion.

I can\u2019t use deorderant, but I never smell(some people with the genes). I can\u2019t use certain face mask, and a big no-no item is chemical sprays. I could sing. Every year, I take at most 2 months of voice lessons(not much because it is part of my violin exam). I can\u2019t dance even though I learned dance for about 2 years. I am not allowing myself to be tired and not get enough sleep by practicing 24/7. Korean companies is the part of the main issue why I don\u2019t want to be an idol. If I do anything that is money related, I have to notify the company, and they will take some of the money. They take up most of the money. If you do concerts like BTS does on tours, they could earn about 1 million per member in a week, but the company takes money and in a year they earn about 6 million at least. I sort of don\u2019t fit in the beauty standards. I have a high nose bridge, but my nose is some sort of wide. My hips are wide and I cannot wear A-Line dresses because my hips will show. I am short. I am 14 years old and about 158 cm in height. I do not want to give up my freedom. I want to have a good life. I want to do things that regular people could do without others noticing. ",

You had to always pay attention to what you're wearing, saying or who you're looking at, and there are many stories of trainees who leave their company, because of enormous pressure etc. You also had to leave your parents and move to another country despite your young age. For me, the only way I would want to become an idol, is if I lived in SK and was Korean, because then I could keep going to school, live with my parents and my friends. ",

            "answer_text": "If I had to create the best idol they would be like this: Visuals: Idols often have to have brilliants visuals to be successful.  and  have some of the best visuals in my opinion. This is a big part as to what makes an idol successful; their face is their image and basically people\u2019s first opinion on them, their act and their entertainment company. Talent: Obviously, idols need to be proficient in at least one area either dancing, singing, or rapping. Many idols have different styles and concepts which appeal to different audience demographics; so their talent is exerted in different ways. The rappers whose styles are my favorite are: Jooheon (Monsta X)  and J-hope (BTS)  and Hyuna  (I really love high tone rappers) The some of the best vocalists in my opinions: Hui (Pentagon)  and Wendy (Red Velvet)  and Doyoung (NCT)  Some of the best dancers in K-pop in my opinion are: Noh Taehyun (Hotshot and JBJ)  and Taemin  and Lisa (BlackPink)  The last thing that I think truly makes an idol is a person who is a fighter. It\u2019s not exactly a secret that being an idol requires the highest degree of perseverance. I think an idol has to be someone who is kind, yet outspoken and compassionate. ",

Anyway if you really have the determination don't let the answers discourage you, but don't be too upset by the results, it's hard for a foreigner to become a K-pop idol.

I never heard of it until I got to Korea and my new Korean friends thought I was dishonest when I told them that I didn\u2019t know who Big Bang and Girls Generation was. Reminds me of the boy band and girl band phase that swept America back in the late 80\u2019s. Surprisingly, K-pop is standing the test of time. Mid 90\u2019s - now. All the girl bands dance the same. They all look the same almost. I get the feeling that the same choreographer teaches all of them how to dance. It definitely looks like they all go to the same plastic surgeon. Sorry if it sounds negative\u2026.just telling it how I saw it. My post might make some Koreans angry\u2026but none of them will call me a liar. ",

So I don\u2019t think I would be able to be a Kpop artist even though it is a dream that young teenage me had. ",

            "answer_text": "First thing a kpop idol and star is different. A kpop idol must know dance, rap and singing. He/She must be proficient in any 3. On the other hand a kpop star can be a singer, dancer or rapper For both u need to practice what u want to do. Everyday u must give a portion of your time to practice. U can practice dancing from Youtube videos and you should get admitted to dancing academy. For singing u can get admitted to a singing academy and practice singing songs u can do the same for rapping. Make yourself unique. Learn personal talents u can distinguish yourself from. Be the best in what you do. One amazing tip i can give u is to write your own songs. Write a song everyday whatever it may sound like this was a tip G dragon followed since he was age 13. Another tip is be funny. Kpop agencies love funny people. Even if u lack talents u can use ur humor to be a kpop star/idol. U can see that in every kpop group there is a funny character who primarily goes to variety shows. After all these you should try applying at different agencies.You can just try for auditions at some unpopular agencies for practice. Make your act unique. Search auditions of some popular Kpop idol/star foe prep. Good luck!! ",

Otherwise known as being able to see how much they can change your style or improve you with their training. Then there\u2019s looks. Plastic surgery, dieting, and exercising are things that are used to help give you an ideal look. Having charisma is something that some companies look into, like JYP. SM however is known to be more focused on appearance. Learning languages is important as well, and if you don\u2019t know Korean, then you better start learning. There is also the intense amount of stress that you go through. Not everything is sunshine and rainbows. Jonghyun was definitely not one of the happier k-pop idols, and not many of them are. You will find that a lot of them have anxiety, eating disorders, and a lot more. There\u2019s probably more, but these are the biggest parts to it. Hope that this helped.

Someone that has no experience in singing/dancing/rapping but has the looks has a high chance of getting street casted in Korea. If you have the talent but your looks are lacking, the company might recommend you to get plastic surgery. Companies also looks for talent. Companies reach out to people who catch their eye during competitions. They also hold auditions and those that pass will be accepted to the company as trainees. Stage presence is very important. If you have a lot of talent but fail to capture peoples\u2019 attention you\u2019ll probably be rejected. You also need to have a lot of determination. Entering the company as a trainee is just the start. It was very challenging while being a trainee - monthly evaluations and the fear of really being able to debut or not. Many trainees crack under the pressure and quit their dreams of debuting. Lastly, manners. You don\u2019t want the company representatives to have a bad impression on you. Even if you are able to debut, if you are rude the public will just throw hate to you. I\u2019m not really sure if the last point is true but the first three are definitely correct. Looks and talent are the biggest factors for debut though. Hope this helps! ",

It's a practical point, you know, and I'm not trying to be racist over here!

Hard dieting before comebacks, training until late everyday and not being able to have a \"normal\" life. Because if you get in a dating scandal it's like saying goodbye idol career (unless you already are famous and have debuted few years before). Also, I wouldn't want to live in Korea. It still is a country where homossexual people are not accepted (it's getting better though) and a anti feminist too. I'm not pretty by Korean standards so probably they'd hate on me because of my appearance, so... ",

There are a lot you have to go through before debuting as a trainee before you debut and come out as an idol and there is where the pressure starts. Ask any person experienced being a trainee, they will tell you; you need to work really hard and it is not really a good experience, because you might not end up debuting. Sometimes it is luck, sometimes it is not meant for them and so on\u2026 Plus some companies have some standards like skills, visuals, experience, being young, knows korean and so on\u2026 And of course they will prefer koreans first, then asians, then international people..

Yes they train for a good reason but lots of idols are mistreated as trainees especially from smaller companies which you are more likel to get into. Its basically dancing, singing, and practicing musical instruments for at least a year. If you\u2019re good enough, maybe 6+ months but it\u2019s really rare. The only way that\u2019s possible is if you already took dancing and singing classes, know how to play an instrument really good, and already have a healthy body. Plus, lots of trainees don\u2019t make the cut. You can never slack off or you\u2019re not making it to the top. You not only need natural talent, you need to practice. Youre trading so much comfort for pain and a really slim chance to make it big. Also even big idols don\u2019t make as much as American artists who don\u2019t have to do as much work. im not giving up food for a slim chance of fame. ",

If your a female pop idol you usually need to be between 40\u201350kg and have toned muscles (there are exceptions to this rule) And you need to have the stage presence to go on tv, modelling, concerts etc. You also need to be prepared for sasaengs (stalker fans) and heaps of hate messages as well as dating scandals and comments on everything you do and wear.

That\u2019s why I say to myself that it\u2019s better to just try to be good at dancing and singing, than becoming an idol with all the pressure they put on you. I just love Myself! :) ",

Being a Kpop idol seemed like a very good summary of everything I wanted in a career. However, since I have become an older Kpop fan I have seen all of the struggles and problems with becoming an idol. I still weigh the options and when it comes the time to decide, I will think about it more. I really want to have a job where I can design and channel my creative juices like 3racha or BTS. I want to travel all around the world and idols travel a lot. If I become a more senior idol I will have time to do activities and stuff I want to, so that seems like a deal. There are SO many bad sides of the industry and being an idol so I have yet to decide exactly what I want. ",

You need to be decent at most of the others too, and willing to learn. I would now say that writing and production skills are also a big plus at many agencies (YG/JYP/Pledis/BigHit/etc), given the way the industry seems to be developing. More practically, you need to be willing to move to Seoul, learn Korean if you don\u2019t speak it, and train really hard for a few years while still keeping your grades up in school, possibly risking incurring tens of thousands of dollars worth of training debt if you are not at a Big 3 agency. You also probably want to be at least partially east or southeast Asian to debut at a major agency. ",

Also practice dancing and complex foot work so you don\u2019t get lost easily, for example pick a piece of choreography and try to perfect in a certain amount of time like a 2 days until you have it down to an hour or less this will make it easily for you in the future. Practicing singing is essential so pull up some voice lessons on YouTube or just keep singing your favourite songs until the pitch in your egisyer becomes easy (still recommend watching some videos so you know what you need to look for). Also if you aren\u2019t fluent in korean better work on that cause it\u2019s extremely important (if you don\u2019t know korean work on singing in your own language) fashion is often picked but it\u2019s important to know how to dress when your outfits aren\u2019t chosen especially if your a foreigner and the fashion is very different. This ties into culture if your a foreigner learn about the culture! ps if your a girl better get used to walking in high heels so just a quick recap staminaendurencedancingsingingkoreanfashionculturewalking in heels",
