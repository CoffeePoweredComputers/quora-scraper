            "answer_text": "When Jimi was brought to England , almost all of the top Musicians and superstars really embraced him artistically . It surprised me to learn that people like Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck , were even intimidated to an extent by Jimi at first on a musical level . Clapton, Beck, and Jimmy Page all really liked Hendrix and respected him and became friends. Paul McCartney , and just about everyone thought he was brilliant , and a great showman.McCartney was largely responsible for getting Hendrix booked at Monterey Pop Festival . So basically Hendrix was in New York City , unknown was whisked away to England by Chas Chandler - was totally embraced by English Rock \u2018royalty\u2019 and they made him a star and he was when he came back to the USA . It\u2019s hard to imagine now because his way of playing ( and Clapton , Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page etc) became part of the Rock vocabulary but Jimi (and others ) was a different kind of leap into new sonic territory on Guitar back then . So almost all Rock Musicians of that era , liked Hendrix and the English especially , who really respected and even revered the Black Musicians who created Blues, Gospel, Jazz, R&B , Rock and Roll - they considered Jimi a part of that Heritage and tradition and he was. After being reintroduced to the USA as a star and brilliant guitarist - almost everyone in Rock and R&B , Pop and some Jazz Musicians respected him , and I imagine there were a lot of examples way outside his genre- like some Classical musicians etc. I don\u2019t think about the past Guitar stuff too much - I am about expanding the Guitar from where it is now \u2026but it is interesting to remember .

            "answer_text": "At the time probably every serious professional guitarist, whether it be lead or bass, were fans or admirers of Jimi Hendrix. He was so innovative and so much better than anybody else then that you could not help to be impressed. I would imagine that even now he is the benchmark that every player would aspire to whether you like his music or not. Everybody mentions Beck and Clapton as admirers but nobody ever mentions that Mickey Dolenz of The Monkees was such a big fan he arranged for the Experience to open for their US tour despite the repercussions. Therefore his appeal ranged from guitar heroes all the way to actors pretending to be drummers. ",
