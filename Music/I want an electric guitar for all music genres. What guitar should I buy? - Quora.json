            "answer_text": "Lets be honest here. The tone mostly depends on the player's technique. But yeah, in general a HSH pickup combo can create a variety of sounds(But that is completely on you). Apart from that since your budget is 20,000 I have one strict advice for you.Don't buy a guitar with a tremolo. You can never get a good tremolo under 20,000. Plus in order to keep the selling price low, these guitars have a compensated tone and tuning stabilty, which are the most important things. Like they use cheap wood for the body, cheap pickups.Always check for tuning stability while buying a guitar. Do some crazy bends and they play some chords. You don't want to go out of tune when you're playing your GnR solos. ",
