            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve written quite a few songs and almost all of them are about my life. Well, I guess I have written a whole album worth of silly songs about dogs which I may or may not have titled Our Tongues Were Long and Our Noses Were Wet which includes the first song I ever wrote, a three chord punk ditty called Dogs: Dogs! Shitting in my room Dogs! Chewing up my broom Dogs! Keep me up at night Dogs! Always want to fight Dogs! Dogs! Dogs! Dogs! Dogs! Find the worst places to pee Dogs! Remind me of me Dogs! Haven\u2019t got a clue Dogs! Remind me of you Dogs! Dogs! Dogs! Dogs! - Ahem\u2026anyway\u2026 Other than silly songs about dogs, almost every song I have written has been about my life. There\u2019s no single song about my whole life because my life has consisted of many phases, each requiring a different mood and genre. Here\u2019s one from my post-drugs days, when my life was engulfed in PAWS. Mostly finger picked around C, Am, and F: These veins are just an old dead tree They gave me wings but took the sky from me So I stuck my head down in the dirt Sometimes being numb is worse than being hurt And lately I just wanna cry Life is a river and it\u2019s swirling on by So I sit and write down all my dreams on stones And tie them to my wretched bones And now I wander in the night I look for stars but I have lost my sight I wish there was someone I wish I could talk about The time I let my spirit out But lately I just wanna cry Life is a river and it\u2019s swirling on by I sit and write down all my dreams on stones And tie them to my wretched bones And lately I just wanna cry Life is an ocean when you\u2019re high and you\u2019re dry So I sit and write down all my dreams in sand And wait for the waves to land ",

            "answer_text": "I might not seem like the person who\u2019d sit down and write about feelings or emotions but i do write a lot of songs whenever i\u2019m going through something. I pour down all my thoughts and experiences on a piece of paper conveying them through symbolism in the form of music. So here\u2019s something i wrote which pretty much describes the battle or criticisms i face everyday. It\u2019s about accepting and coming in terms with your vulnerabilities. It\u2019s about hope and resilience. Not just me but a lot of people face these kind of stuff whenever they take bold actions or are crazy enough to dream big.  The song\u2019s called \u201cKnifes Await\u201d We sleep through the night dreaming of pretty skies and the blinding lights Hoping we'd wake to be just fine. Find ourselves under the napalm skies Wondering if home feels like a stranger word Making this noise, music to our ears Do you even know yourself, hello? Shit's getting hard, wall's getting closer, Drowning feels so easy now, Hoping this would be just a dream To be broken by our self esteem. She isn't calling out for help anymore, \"Is that why a woman made for?\" Seems like she's been here before, Then why the hell was she siting by the seashore? Pre-chorus When they get loud, When they tear us down, When we lose our way, When they least expect, Chorus: We're gonna show them what's unseen, When the fire's at our feet, We'd hide our scars and make them proud. Do you believe in me? Believe in me? Nothing in the world could bring us down. Nothing's so great for us to settle down. We don't care how many knifes await. Do you believe in me? Believe in me? This entire song is for all the misfits, the misunderstood quirky people, all the weirdos doing great things. Just wanna say, hang in there. Keep creating. Be bold and take risks. The future\u2019s bright. You know, \"Here's to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes ... the ones who see things differently -- they're not fond of rules, and they have no respect for the status quo. ... You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can't do is ignore them because they change things. ... They push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the people who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.\" Hopefully i put the song out someday. Have a nice day. ",
