            "answer_text": "My guess would be that the richest musicians write their own songs. John Lennon and Paul McCartney both figured pretty quickly that their money was going to come from songwriting royalties. The way the music industry is now set up, bands have to make their money from touring. Younger people would rather get free music online than pay for it now. The days of artists selling 30 million copies of an album are no more. My guess is Paul McCartney has made most of his money from songs he wrote in his 20's. ",

            "answer_text": "The business side of the industry is backed by lawyers and accountants. Most musicians are in for the art and want to avoid the business side. For instance, most labels end up owning most of the rights to recordings and the \u2018advance\u2019 money carries interest and unlike other media, they are charged for recording studio time (if they don\u2019t negotiate) so the label doesn\u2019t care if they show up the studio, drink, drug and noodle around writing songs since the label charges them them + interest so in the old days, if they could perform live in big venues, they could make enough so that they didn\u2019t notice the gold record netted them very little actual money \u2026 BTW, remember record-CD cubs? Unless you were a major star, those sales are consideration promotional and netted them NOTHING. That\u2019s why they were willing to sell them 5 for a penny. ",
