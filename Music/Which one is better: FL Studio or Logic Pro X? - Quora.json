            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve used FL occasionally since its 1st release but it\u2019s never been my go-to DAW, I primarily use Ableton and LPX. I hate to say one program is better than the other because they all shine in their own ways; I feel that some programs \u201cwork the way you think\u201d whereas others don\u2019t. Some things to think about: LPX is only available on Mac; FL Studio used to be Windows only but I believe it\u2019s available on MacOS now 10.11 or higher, I haven\u2019t seen a Mac version in person so I can\u2019t attest to this aspectLPX is $200 and comes with a ton of audio/MIDI loops.FL Studio ranges from $99-$899.LPX has some really great plug-ins, some not-so-great/old/ugly UI. They\u2019ve also been notoriously slow in keeping it upgraded although the last major upgrade and point revisions have seen some really awesome improvements along with the inclusion of Alchemy.FL Studio does not charge for upgrades so you can feel safe that you\u2019ll never have to buy any new versions/updates.LPX hasn\u2019t charged anything for their updates but they don\u2019t guarantee that they won\u2019t in the future.FL Studio has a live performance function (DJ Control) which may be of interest to some. LPX can be used live but the interface and workflow really isn\u2019t made to be used as such HOWEVER, you can purchase Main Stage (in addition to LPX) for $30 and get access to a great live performance tool (I\u2019ve used this mostly in musicals which require lots of program/patch switching, cues, sequence of events, etc). That being said FL is more for DJ/EDM type live performance and MainStage/LPX for musicians who play instruments.My personal experience: For the dollar amount LPX carries far more valueFL Studio\u2019s workflow is great for mainly \u201cin-the-box\u201d electronic production. It doesn\u2019t lend well to recording live sound sources and mixing is non-intuitive and doesn\u2019t resemble the workflow of other programs such as ProTools, LPX, Cubase, et al.LPX works great for a wide variety of genres ranging from purely acoustic recording & mixing to all in-the-box electronic productionsIf I had to choose one it would be LPX but I wouldn\u2019t discourage you from trying out FL Studio, in fact they have a trial version you can try out before committing to a purchase. Hope that helps and good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "To the people saying that no one uses FL Studio professionally; most hip hop producers use FL Studio. As far as which is better, I have experience with both so can offer an unbiased opinion. FL Studio - I learnt how to produce on FL Studio and having then struggled to use Logic even after producing music for a year, I\u2019d say that FL is easier to learn on. However, the instruments/synths that come equipped with FL Studio aren\u2019t the best, especially the pianos. So unless you\u2019re willing to pay more for various third party plug-ins FL doesn\u2019t win this round. On the other hand FL Studio\u2019s channel rack is very handy and makes arranging drums much easier. Some people say it has more natural \u2018bounce\u2019 than Logic, but I can\u2019t really see any difference. As well as that, FL Studio is just much more user friendly and easier to use. The piano roll is better, and so the mixer isn\u2019t riddled with information that at times is overwhelming, especially for a beginner. I think the genre of the music you make plays a massive role in which is \u2018better\u2019. If you\u2019re looking to make dance music or hip hop I reckon FL is better, but for rock etc I\u2019d suggest Logic. But, at the end of the day this is just my opinion. ",
