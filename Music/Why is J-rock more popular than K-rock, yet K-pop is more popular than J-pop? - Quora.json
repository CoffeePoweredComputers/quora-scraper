            "answer_text": "Why South Korea doesn\u2019t like rock K-rock bands and rock are not very popular among South Korean people right now. I\u2019ve heard young people listen a lot to hip-hop and mostly teenagers and kids listen to k-pop. Edit: and probably the most favorite genre in South Korea are ballads, always taking several places at the top of South Korean music charts. It is supposed to be because of \u2018han\u2019 mentality of Korean people. Han explained by Korean:  But there was a time when indie was very popular in Korea, about 15 years ago, until one incident that happened on live broadcast in national TV during Saturday afternoon. It was something like a rock concert of festival and because of several musicians a hell kind of broke out. Acted like crazy, there was fire and nudity\u2026 Very conservative South Korean people didn\u2019t like it at all. Rock bands were banned from tv, rock fell into disgrace and was associated with bad and dangerous behavior. DKDKTV sums this incident in a short video \u201cWorst day in Korean music history\u201d. I like rock, so I searched and found several k-rock groups that are famous globally and have some nice big fan base (mostly out of South Korea), yet they are far from the fame of the most famous k-pop groups. Entertainment agencies are well aware of Korean opinion on rock and disinterest, that\u2019s why they are very hesitant to form k-rock bands. Day6, N.Flying and The Rose are my favorite and you don\u2019t really hear much about other bands. In Eric Nam\u2019s podcast member of DAY6, Young K, explained that life is really difficult for bands in Korea, also because of how music industry works there. It\u2019s far more adjusted for dancing and singing groups or soloists. When there\u2019s a festival, live event or artists want to perform outdoor in public (it\u2019s common way for new groups to promote themselves in South Korea and get new fans) it\u2019s way more easier do prepare a stage for singers and dancers than for a band with music instruments.  Edit: in May 12 this year DAY6 achieved something amazing. Their new song Zombie got to 4th place in Melon charts. When I think a bout it, it could possibly be first k-rock song in a decade doing this well on Korean charts.  Why J-rock is more popular I\u2019m not sure. Maybe because there are far more (and I mean FAR MORE) j-rock bands and bigger competition leads to better quality? I believe Japanese like rock, so they are also good at making it. And I love listening to it! Why is k-pop more popular than j-pop My personal guess is that it\u2019s because of VERY high Korean standards. It starts from idol visuals, clothes, perfect skin and makeup, through perfectly learned and executed mind-blowing choreography, to marketing and very cool, picturesque, colorful, professional, trendsetting or newest trends following music videos that can cost millions of dollars to make, sometimes also because of the special effects used. K-pop aims for perfection and is ready to starve their idols or get the last bit of strength out of them to achieve it (I am exaggerating now a little, but only a little). Boy group MV example  Girl group MV example  And perfection draws attention (Instagram...), people look up to it. Love it, want to achieve it. Just notice how many questions on Quora are about k-pop visuals. Compare it to number of questions about k-pop music you encountered here. For me it could probably easily be 1 to 1000. I personally think that k-pop is far more about visuals (idols, videos) and charisma then music, and it\u2019s success is based mainly on them. As I see J-pop, from my very limited experience, it is not aiming for perfection. Or not as much as k-pop. It has it\u2019s own style that is probably not as appealing to young generation as k-pop is. But I don\u2019t really listen to j-pop and I have seen only several MVs, so maybe I would be surprised.
