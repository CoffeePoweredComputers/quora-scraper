            "answer_text": "My brother and I both had CV50\u2019s. His sounded better than mine. We experimented putting The same electronics into different guitars and they sounded different. The richest body being a warmoth. We made sure everything had the same block. It struck us as strange the CV50\u2019s both sounded so different. His sounded great, while mine sounded thing and awful. So I opened mine and started chipping at the Alder only to find it wasn\u2019t a solid piece of Alder but wood chips glued tightly together. He did the same with his to find his was also pieces of Alder? glued together. Still, his sounded better than mine. I started buying all kinds of different Squiers. I had an 80\u2019s Japanese Squier, which was amazing. Two Tone Pro\u2019s from 97ish, which were also fantastic but lacked a vintage finish on the neck. They had beautiful ash bodies. One, Indian Squier which had a beautiful Cedar body but stunk of pungent Indian Rosewood. It smelled bad, like defecation. It also had a horrible fret job. I put a lot of chemicals to get rid of the smell and did a very aggressive fret job. Anyway, the necks on Squier CV50 and CV60\u2019s are decent. About the same as some Mexican strats. I\u2019ve used them on different bodies and had great results. As nice as they are they don\u2019t compare to the Made in America Strats nor the Made in Japan strats. They have better tuners, better wood, better fret jobs, better electronics, better pickups, more rounded necks and better finishes. As far as Epiphones, the difference it similar but I haven\u2019t experimented as much with them but they\u2019re not as good as Gibson Les Paul\u2019s because of wood, finish, polyurethane vs nitrocellulose finish. The tuners on Epiphones are generally horrible, pickups and electronics are not as good, fret job is not as good. The thing about Epiphones is they are usually glued on and not as interchangeable as Squiers. If you\u2019re on a budget and want a decent guitar get a used CV50 or CV60, depending on if you want a rosewood neck or not. If you\u2019re into Gibson, try an Epiphone Les Paul Special II plus Limited Edition. You can pick a used one up for about $120 dollars. The Squiers have retained their value and gone up more than the Epiphones, but these Epiphones are decent. ",

            "answer_text": "They are both well made guitars. The quality in the lowest priced models in both brands is going to be more variable. But the middle to higher dollar models are usually decent guitars for the money. On the Squier, the Affinity series is the cheapest/lowest quality of the Squiers IMHO - I think the Bullet series is a little more solid than those. The CV, Vintage Modified, and Standard series Squiers are all good enough to gig with - and they\u2019re all easy to modify if you want to make changes. The Epi\u2019s are similar - but I\u2019ve only had a few of those over the years. But again, nothing inherently wrong with any of the up-market versions ($250+). I think the biggest decision you have to make between the two is do you want a Fender-ish feel and sound or a Gibson-ish feel and sound. To me the necks are the big difference in playability - I really don\u2019t like the Epi necks. But that\u2019s just a personal preference and says nothing about the quality or the Epi. Other folks feel just the opposite. No one is wrong, it\u2019s just what do you prefer. If you\u2019re looking used, older models from Korea, Indonesia and Japan are going to be the better quality. But newer models from China can be just as good if that\u2019s what their contract calls for. ",

            "answer_text": "The lowest grade Epiphone guitars are as good as the midrange Squier guitars. While Squier has a reputation for offering beginner models, gigging models, and affordable premium/custom/reissue models (if that makes sense), Epiphone has always put out gig-worthy guitars, with their highest end guitars actually getting into the Gibson and Fender brands territory. So now, it depends on which Squier series is being compared to what Epiphone series. For example, I wouldn\u2019t even bother with the Squier Affinity unless it was a gift for a kid, or something to start a friend with. The Squier Classic Vibe vs one of the Epiphone Standard models on the other hand can become a difficult choice. ",

            "answer_text": "Epiphone really competes with Made in Mexico Fender branded product, not Squire. Having said that, the top end of the Epiphone and Squire lines are fine instruments! I have an Episode Les Paul Pro and the p/us are fabulous. It has the neck binding and a great maple flame top. My son owns a higher end maple top squire, and that had electronics issues. The neck was good as well as the dressed frets, which IMO, is the #1 thing to consider for a lower end guitar. Nothing a new loaded pickguard didn't fix, btw. It was upgraded to humbuckers. ;-) ",

The best Squiers (classic vibe) are as good as the best Epiphones (custom shop/elitist), and some say they even rival their Fender/Gibson counterparts. ",
