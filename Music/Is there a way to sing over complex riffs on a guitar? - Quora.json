            "answer_text": "You asked, so here it goes\u2026 The easiest way is to have a repetitive pattern of notes to play over. So the muscle memory in your hands follows the pattern, and, in a perfect world, frees up the other side of your brain to elaborate on the notes in your head to spit it out. Predicting ahead of time if a certain pattern will be easy or hard to sing over, can be tough. In this endeavor, simpler isn\u2019t alway easier. A simple guitar riff, played in a complex time signature (say 7/4) will probably stump the masses unless the vocal follows the guitar to a degree. Haha. So, you want to get good at this game huh? Start by tapping your foot to the beat! If you haven\u2019t done it before or do a lot of solo playing, this can be nerve wracking! But do it from beginning to end of the song. You have to establish a meter in your head that is real time and constant. Trust me on this one. If you haven\u2019t done it before, start. I can\u2019t over simplify this enough. I learned to tap my foot to the beat while taking Cornet lessons at 10 years old. It seemed like calculus to me then because my first intro to playing music was Piano. and you have pedals downstairs. So you aren\u2019t learning to tap much. The horn teacher was consistently reminding us youngsters to \u2018tap your feet while playing\u2019. It worked. If your timing strayed, he\u2019d look at your feet! He knew, and fortunately didn\u2019t give up on us. I didn\u2019t realize it then, I realized it when trying to sing Steve Perry vocals over Neal Schon guitar parts playing in cover bands! Most Rock/Pop songs are in 4/4, 3/4, or 3/2 time signatures. Why? So you can dance to it, move and groove with it! The tougher the time signatures, the more difficulties when combining vocals and lead playing. Unless you \u201csing over\u201d the part using a lot of half and whole notes. How much independence do you have? How much independence do you exhibit while playing? Most axe men I know, say they have a lot of it. Yet most of them have their heads buried in their chest or just look down a lot when performing. Can you carry on a conversation while playing? Can you answer a question while playing? Can you flirt with the girls while doing it? That all shows brain independence. And you need a healthy dose of it to sing over complex riffs. Last, and certainly not least, let\u2019s talk about singing. What kind of singing? Melodic, jazzy, maybe bluesy? You don\u2019t hear the name George Benson on this forum a lot, but he could play like the wind and sing like a bird too. Wanna sing metal? Dave Mustaine can do both, and he had the luxury of playing with other guitar players too. Which makes it hell-o easier! If you wanna sing the agro stuff, are you gonna sing a melody or a Cookie Monster vocal? They just aren\u2019t that critical at that volume. If it is the latter, good luck my friend. I\u2019ll help you find a good ENT doctor! Doh\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "You can sing over complex riffs by listening to the riffs repeatedly. A good friend of mine had told me that you can find your space if you listen to what is around you. If the composition is an original work, you can target parts of the complex riff for vocal opportunities. This is where collaboration comes in. Define the riff. Define the vocal melody. Define the bass support structures. The vocals can work with the bass and the chord work. The vocals can be placed as the top voice and be located in sections that are contrary to the riff. Where the riff intensifies, the vocals can fade back or vice versa. The vocals can also become part of the riff. It all depends on the interaction of the players. Know your players. Use the vocal line over different instruments to see what fits best, then dig in. P.S. The basic components for music creation are theme, variation, activity and rest. Dynamics (variations in volume) and articulation (using the punctuation of music to make your phrases sound like conversation.!,?#+ * etc.) are also quite handy. I used to practice singing with lead solos just find my mark. I used to use a scat style and I would scat along as I played some of the fast tunes from Alvin Lee\u2019s recordings. Alvin Lee\u2019s most popular song was \u201cI\u2019d love to change the world.\u201d It seems that his other dozen or so albums have been overlooked through the years. It was a good exercise to scat along with his riffs while my guitar tried to keep up with him. I hope this is helpful. Good luck! ",
