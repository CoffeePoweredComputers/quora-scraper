            "answer_text": "First of all getting famous is like winning the lottery. Your chances of becoming famous for anything are about 0%. The world is filled with wonderfully talented singers and musicians and most never become famous. If you like singing do it because you enjoy it, not because you think you will become famous. I have performed for years as a singer and guitarist around my city. I've know and worked with many talented musicians and singers. I am now in my 60's and in all these years not one person that I have ever known or worked with has ever become famous. Some are known locally but that's about it. Most musicians have other careers or are teachers. One of the most popular band leaders in town is also a teacher and teaches band in the middle school. The fact is that the live music scene over the years has largely disappeared. When I first started performing out in the early1970's live music was everywhere and musicians could play five and six nights a week in nightclubs, bars, restaurants, etc. I played for several years regularly at the same place. Today most establishments don't have live music and the very few that do only have it once or twice a week. There are more musicians around than places to play. The only reason I performed for a living was because there was work available. Today, with so few opportunities to play, I wouldn't even consider it for a career. I don't want to discourage you from your dream but the music business is not at all what it seems. Success in the music industry is and has always been about, who you know. It can be a nice hobby and if you really enjoy singing you might take singing lessons and enjoy it even more but don't do it because you expect to get famous. Almost nobody gets famous. Reality. ",

            "answer_text": "No, it\u2019s not too late but in my experience people who do something for the sole purpose of \u201cfame\u201d don\u2019t usually succeed. Do you like singing? Do you love it? If the answer to that is no, you will have a hard time accomplishing this goal. Do you know what many famous singers have in common? The feeling that there is nothing else in the world that they want to do, like music is all there is and that it\u2019s better to be a starving musician than it is to be in any other career. Also, how are you with disappointment and rejection? It can be very personal to put yourself out there with performing. You may find that criticism of your voice feels very personal and to succeed you\u2019ll have to get over yourself, listen carefully to what people tell you and figure out how to discern good advice from bad. Anyway, I\u2019m not trying to discourage you before you start but just encourage you to be honest with yourself. So, having said that, start training, start practicing. Find a good vocal coach, work with them and give it your all. If you can\u2019t afford to pay for private lessons, join a choir and find some good internet teachers (ones with good credentials). Start a youtube channel and a soundcloud but be prepared to realistically assess yourself, it\u2019s much better to figure out your own flaws than to wait to hear it from strangers on the internet. Good luck! ",
