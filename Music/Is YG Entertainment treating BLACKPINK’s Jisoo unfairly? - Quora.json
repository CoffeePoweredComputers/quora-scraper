            "answer_text": "Honestly, I don\u2019t think YG has any feelings for Jisoo. To YG, I think Jisoo is kinda just there. They merely think of her as a visual. The outfits they give her aren\u2019t outstanding, but they aren\u2019t terrible. Another reason why I think they merely think of her as a visual, is because in their snogs, she barely gets an outstanding line/part. AIIYL\u2014Jennie and Ros\u00e9 got the bridge parts D4\u2014Ros\u00e9 got the bridge part Kill This Love\u2014Ros\u00e9 got the bridge part, Jennie\u2019s voice was louder than the others at the end DKWTD/Forever Young\u2014Ros\u00e9 and Jennie get the chorus, and Jisoo\u2019s only chorus part is the \u2018you~\u2019 Basically-any-Blackpink-song\u2014Jennie and Ros\u00e9 take turns doing the chorus, Jisoo would be the \u2018backup vocals\u2019 or get to sing 2 words; Lisa sometimes gets the most memorable rap parts; Jisoo\u2026 They clearly don\u2019t think of her as anything more or anything less than a visual. They really neglecting talent. Lisa also doesn\u2019t really get much, but we\u2019re talking about Jisoo here. ",

            "answer_text": "TBH, yes. She has the least line in any Blackpink songs. When how you like that teaser was out, YG only posts 3 sets of photos. And the members? Well, of course, Jennie, Lisa, and Rose. So that means, she didn\u2019t get any individual picture. She wasn't in any thumbnails of MOST Blackpink's music video. And the reason why I think YG is treating her like this because she \u201cDoN\u2019T fIt In BlAcKpInK.\u201d Other members can speak English fluently, but she can\u2019t. Other members have WeStErN popular names, while her name is Jisoo. Even if I got the reason wrong, he still doesn\u2019t have excuses to treat Jisoo unfairly from the other member!!!! Hope YG learns ",
