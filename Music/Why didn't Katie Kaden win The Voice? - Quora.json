            "answer_text": "Because a white male with a guitar playing country appeals to more viewers of \u201cThe Voice\" who vote, and they voted for Jake. Katie was terrific, but her main genre seemed to be blues, which doesn't appeal to as many viewers. Also, I'm sure some narrow minded people cant get past her looks. I can see a career on Broadway or the theatre for her, someone who is not afraid to be outrageous and can sing like that live is a good candidate for that. I hope she keeps going. \u201cThe Voice\" and American Idol both have this problem. The viewers vote in generic white guys with guitars over everyone else, it seems these days, and it's getting pretty dull. ",
