PARK CHOA (former Ace Of Angels) was wearing black safety shorts under her denim short pants & her skater skirt.  SHIN HYEJEONG (Ace Of Angels) was wearing black safety shorts under her skater skirt.  Those garment were called \u201csafety shorts.\u201d Most of the famous K-Pop female idols will be wearing it under their stage outfits during their hot & sexy dancing/singing great show performances. Safety shorts is actually not an underwear. It's a piece of close-fitting undercover layer shorts in mostly black, white or other colours which were frequently worn under their short skirts, short pants & short dresses only.  (KOREAN SAFETY SHORTS)  Safety shorts will protect all those K-Pop female idols from any unwanted cleavage, unexpected dance moves & their show wardrobe malfunctions on stage. Sometimes, if they didn't wear any safety shorts they will be wearing other legwear such as dancing tights, fishnet tights, patterned tights & leggings as their own preferences or choices as well.

            "answer_text": "I dont quite understand what that question means. Do you mean like clothes? So if they perform, they have their stage clothes, usually for boy groups, if they are wearing a suit already or proper clothing, they wont wear anything else below because they dance a lot and it gets quite stuffy if you were to wear other clothing underneath. For girl groups, their attire for performance is really little like a crop top, so other than their bra then i dont think they would wear anything underneath, except if they wear short dresses then yes. For stage use, they also either wear a mic pack or use microphones. For mic packs, they have to wear a belt under because it often can be quite heavy so to prevent it from falling, they wear a separate belt around their lower stomach. For microphones, they do not have to do that. Hope this helps! :) ",
