            "answer_text": " She lead a good, privileged childhood that she has been very lucky and blessed with. Her parents were wealthy with her dad\u2019s work as a stock broker, and Taylor had a brother, Austin, who is a few years younger than her. The Swift\u2019s lived in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania (she was born in Reading, Pennsylvania). Her family owned a family Christmas tree farm, where Taylor helped pull out the eggs of the insects that would burrow there. Taylor was a great, straight-A student in school. By the time Taylor was 10 she was singing at a wide variety of local events (including musical theater). Her parents were very supportive of Taylor\u2019s music talents; in fact her mom, Andrea, and her brother drove Taylor to Nashville when she was 11 to different country record label companies (the famous \u201cHey I\u2019m Taylor, I\u2019m 11, and I want a record deal\u201d story that she would tell on Ellen years later). Not all things were good and happy, however. In middle and elementary school, Taylor was bullied: \u201cI just remember my mom looking at me and saying, 'We're going to King of Prussia Mall.' Which is the big, big mall in Pennsylvania, 45 minutes away. So we left and went to the better mall. My mom let me escape from certain things that were too painful to deal with. And we talked about it the whole ride there, and we had a good time shopping.\u201d On her 1989 Tour, she\u2019d address the audience about how \u201cmusic was there for her when people weren\u2019t.\u201d When she was 12, she learned to play the guitar and she wrote her own songs. When she was 13 her family moved to Hendersonville, a suburb near Nashville, to support her country music dream. I applaud her parents because that would\u2019ve been tough to drop everything and move to Nashville for her. Soon after she attended Henderson High School for her freshman and sophomore years, where she met her best friend Abigail Anderson (Abigail is still a really close friend to Taylor to this day. Taylor was in Abigail\u2019s wedding, Abigail has done interviews alongside Taylor, she been at the reputation secret sessions, and in a handful of Taylor music videos.) When her country music career took off with Big Machine Records, Taylor began Aaron Academy, a private Christian school that offers homeschooling. Being the academic she is, she completed high school with a 4.0 grade point average and she finished the last two years of high school in 12 months. Her childhood, to say the least, formed her to be the person she is today. Sources: Taylor Swift claims she was totally unpopular in school and told a depressing story about being snubbed by friends to prove it ",
