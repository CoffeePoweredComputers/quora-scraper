I love America don\u2019t get it twisted but I have offended so many people in America throughout my career that I no longer see a point in stepping off that path. I\u2019m way past the point of no return. And I\u2019m cool with that. My personal values are different from the majority of my fellow Americans and I\u2019ve long stopped caring about their feelings towards me. When people fail at shutting you down through words, they try to shut you out through social exclusion. That\u2019s what I\u2019m dealing with right now and since I don\u2019t think I will ever be accepted by my fellow Americans, I\u2019m just going to keep doing me, complete my 5 language Duolingo lessons, and make a living as an entertainer overseas.
