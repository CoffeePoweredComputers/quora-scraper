            "answer_text": "Indeed. They control all kinds of music, including the music of rappers. And this is because music is a powerful influence on youth. To control youth, it is best to control the music young people listen to. Already in Mozart's time, the Illuminati told him how his compositions should be. And once Beethoven got very upset when they imposed a \u201cMI\u201d instead of a \u201cDO\u201d on his Fifth Symphony. This affair led to a famous illuminati called Telesforus to invent country dance (which was originally danced on top of a cow) to counteract the influence of Beethoven's music, considered too revolutionary and mass agitator because of its many \u201cDOs\u201d and few \u201cMIs.

            "answer_text": "No. The ONLY way to join the Illuminati is to invent a time machine and go to late-1770s Bavaria. And get recruited by them. The Illuminati were founded in 1776 as the Perfectibilists, changing to the Order of the Illuminati in a couple of years, and was banned in the mid-1780s.They were not a sinister organization except to the Church and the State of Bavaria. They wanted to separate Church and State and abolish hereditary monarchies.You can read about their history and study the actual rituals in the book The Secret School of Wisdom, which is the first English-language translation of the Illuminati degree rituals. It's also available in French.Anyone calling themselves the Illuminati and pretending to offer riches and power have no ties to the original Order. There are no celebrities that sold their souls or killed a loved one in order to become rich and famous as members of the Illuminati.Anyone claiming to be the Illuminati is lying unless they are at least 250 years old and are German.The Order was blamed for starting the French Revolution in a 1799 book by Abb\u00e9 Augustin Barruel and referred to in English the following year in a book by John Robison. The real Illuminati had been completely disbanded by then. ",
