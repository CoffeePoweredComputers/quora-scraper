            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s fun thing nobody really talks about in music: Nobody is in time, but some people are more in time than others. Essentially, we keep time by instinct alone but our perception of time is extremely flawed and skewed massively by mood, adrenaline, fatigue and a hundred tiny things. Assuming you\u2019re not playing to a metronome then there\u2019s always going to be some amount of drift in speed and feel across a song. In fact, even with the metronome there\u2019s still a fair amount of sliding about. However, as you improve over time you get a better sense for this drift. It\u2019s possible to pick up on changes of 1\u20132bpm if you\u2019re paying attention. In the end it becomes a combination of relaxed instinct and active fault-checking. So here\u2019s a fun test for you: Put on September by Earth, Wind and Fire.Listen until the end of the song.Immediately skip back to the 15 second markNow tell me, is it the same speed? What happened to the tempo? Do you notice it during step 1 or not until you skippped back?  Things like this are the difference between professionals and gifted beginners. There\u2019s no exercise for chopping wood like chopping wood after all! ",

You hold it down. If you are listening to a click just make sure you hit 1 every measure then everything else is probably pretty damn close as long as you hit that down beat. ",
