            "answer_text": "Yes, but you\u2019d be much better off with ANY other machine. A Cricut is a machine for home crafters. If you\u2019re making car decals to sell, you should buy a cutter from a sign supply company. There are quite a few, but the most important thing is, make sure the cutter you get will accept Roland-compatible blades. Roland is pretty much the gold standard of contour cutters (and they\u2019re priced to match!) and there\u2019s a huge selection of Roland-compatible blades on the market. Sign supply companies will have the other things you will need, like blades, squeegees, Oracal marking film (accept no substitutes!), weeding tools and transfer tape. ",
