Dubbed Hampton 70: A Celebration of Col. Bruce Hampton, it was an all-star concert featuring Widespread Panic members John Bell, Dave Schools, Duane Trucks and Jimmy Herring; blues guitarist Tinsley Ellis, Peter Buck of R.E.M; steel guitarist Darick Campbell; saxophone player Karl Denson; Drew Emmitt and Vince Herman of Leftover Salmon; Jon Fishman of Phish; banjo player Rev. Jeff Mosier; guitarist Warren Haynes; Drivin N Cryin frontman Kevn Kinney; Atlanta jazz-staple Johnny Knapp; Chuck Leavell; Athens rock-troubadour T. Hardy Morris; 13-year-old guitar prodigy Brandon Niederauer; Slide Guitarist Derek Trucks and Blues Singer Susan Tedeschi of the Tedeschi Trucks Band; John Popper of Blues Traveler; funk bassist Kevin Scott; keyboardist Matt Slocum; Denny Walley of Frank Zappa fame; gypsy-metal guitarist Emil Werstler; Oliver Wood of The Wood Brothers; MLB pitcher Jake Peavy; and the Colonel\u2019s Sling Blade co-star, actor Billy Bob Thornton who cancelled due to illness. The event was produced by Good Times Productions with the proceeds benefiting the Fox Theatre Institute and other musician-focused charities. During the encore performance of the show, Hampton suffered a medical emergency and collapsed on stage. [17] Onlookers and his fellow musicians initially either did not notice that Hampton had collapsed, or thought it was a ruse. As a result, Hampton lay face down at Niederauer's feet, his left arm draped over a stage monitor, as Niederauer soloed on \"Turn on Your Love Light.\" The band played for several minutes before Hampton was taken offstage for medical attention; he died shortly thereafter at Emory University Hospital Midtown in Atlanta, Georgia.
