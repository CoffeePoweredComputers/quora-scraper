            "answer_text": "Song Facts: Paul McCartney wrote most of this song. He got \"Rigby\" from the name of a store (Rigby and Evens Ltd Wine and Spirit Shippers) and \"Eleanor\" from actress Eleanor Bron. He liked the name \"Eleanor Rigby\" because it sounded natural. McCartney explained at the time that his songs came mostly from his imagination. Regarding this song, he said, \"It just came. When I started doing the melody I developed the lyric. It all came from the first line. I wonder if there are girls called Eleanor Rigby?\" McCartney wasn't sure what the song was going to be about until he came up with the line, \"Picks up the rice in a church where a wedding has been.\" That's when he came up with the story an old, lonely woman. The lyrics, \"Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door\" are a reference to the cold-cream she wears in an effort to look younger. The song tells the story of two lonely people. First, we meet a churchgoing woman named Eleanor Rigby, who is seen cleaning up rice after a wedding. The second verse introduces the pastor, Father McKenzie, whose sermons \"no one will hear.\" This could indicate that nobody in coming to his church, or that his sermons aren't getting through to the congregation on a spiritual level. In the third verse, Eleanor dies in the church and Father McKenzie buries her.\"Father Mackenzie\" was originally \"Father McCartney.\" Paul decided he didn't want to freak out his dad and picked a name out of the phone book instead.After Eleanor Rigby is buried, we learn that \"No one was saved,\" indicating that her soul did not elevate to heaven as promised by the church. This could be seen as a swipe at Christianity and the concept of being saved by Jesus. The song was released in August 1966 just weeks after the furor over John Lennon's remarks, \"Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I will be proved right. We're more popular than Jesus now.\"For the most part, the song eluded controversy, possibly because the lilting string section made it easier to handle.A string section scored by Beatles producer George Martin consisting of four violins, two violas and two cellos were used in recording. Paul may have been inspired by the classic composer Vivaldi.The Beatles didn't play any of the instruments on this track. All the music came from the string players, who were hired as session musicians.Paul McCartney (from Observer Music Monthly November 2008): \"When I was a kid I was very lucky to have a real cool dad, a working-class gent, who always encouraged us to give up our seat on the bus for old people. This led me into going round to pensioners' houses. It sounds a bit goody-goody, so I don't normally tell too many people. There were a couple of old ladies and I used to go round and say, 'Do you need any shopping done?' These lonely old ladies were something I knew about growing up, and that was what 'Eleanor Rigby' was about - the fact that she died and nobody really noticed. I knew this went on.\"There is a gravestone for an Eleanor Rigby in St. Peter's Churchyard in Woolton, England. Woolton is a suburb of Liverpool and Lennon first met McCartney at a fete at St Peter's Church. The gravestone bearing the name Eleanor Rigby shows that she died in October 1939, aged 44. However Eleanor was not like the lonely people in McCartney's song, as she was married. Another of the gravestones there has the word \"McKenzie\" written on it. McCartney has denied that that is the source of the names, though he has agreed that they may have registered subconsciously.This was originally written as \"Miss Daisy Hawkins.\" According to Rolling Stone magazine, when McCartney first played the song for his neighbor Donovan Leitch, the words were \"Ola Na Tungee, blowing his mind in the dark with a pipe full of clay.\" >>The lyrics were brainstormed among The Beatles. In later years, Lennon and McCartney gave different accounts of who contributed more of the words to the song.Microphones were placed very close to the instruments to create and unusual sound.Ray Charles reached #35 US and #36 UK with his version in 1968; Aretha Franklin took it to #17 US in 1969. A year later, an instrumental by the group El Chicano went to #115. The song reached the chart again in 2008 when David Cook of American Idol fame took it to #92.Because of the string section, this was difficult to play live, which The Beatles never did. On his 2002 Back In The US tour, Paul McCartney played this without the strings. Keyboards were used to compensate.This song was not written in a normal chord, it is in the dorian mode - the scale you get when you play one octave up from the second note of a major scale. This is usually found in old songs such as \"Scarborough Fair.\" >>Vanilla Fudge covered this in a slowed-down, emotional style. They've done this with many songs, including hits by *NSYNC, and The Backstreet Boys. Their version of \"You Keep Me Hangin' On\" was a #6 US hit in 1968. Says Fudge drummer Carmine Appice: \"Most of the songs we did, we tried to take out of the realm they were in and try to put them where they were supposed to be in our eyes. 'Eleanor Rigby' was always a great song by The Beatles. It was done with the orchestra, but the way we did it, we put it into an eerie graveyard setting and made it spooky, the way the lyrics read. Songs like Ticket To Ride, that's a hurtin' song, so we slowed it down so it wouldn't be so happy. We would look at lyrics and the lyrics would dictate if it was feasible to do something with it or not.\" (Info courtesy of Carmine, who spoke with us about the song. His website is carmineappice.net.)In 1966, this song took home the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Pop Vocal Performance, Male. It was awarded to Paul McCartney. >>In August 1966, the long-defunct British music magazine Disc And Music Echo asked Kinks frontman Ray Davies to review the then newly released Revolver album. This is how he reacted to this song: \"I bought a Haydn LP the other day and this sounds just like it. It's all sort of quartet stuff and it sounds like they're out to please music teachers in primary schools. I can imagine John saying: 'I'm going to write this for my old schoolmistress'. Still it's very commercial.\"The chorus of this song was sampled as part of Sinead O'Connor's 1994 song \"Famine,\" which is based on the story of the potato famine in Ireland. >>In 2008 a document came to light that showed that McCartney may have had an alternative source for the Eleanor Rigby name. In the early 1990s a lady named Annie Mawson had a job teaching music to children with learning difficulties. Annie managed to teach a severely autistic boy to play \"Yellow Submarine,\" on the piano, which won him a Duke of Edinburgh Silver Award. She wrote to the former Beatle telling him what joy he'd brought. Months later, Annie received a brown envelope bearing a 'Paul McCartney World Tour' stamp. Inside was enclosed a page from an accounts log kept by the Corporation of Liverpool, which records the wages paid in 1911 to a scullery maid working for the Liverpool City Hospital, who signed her name \"E. Rigby.\" There was no accompanying letter of explanation. Annie said in an interview that when she saw the name Rigby, \"I realized why I'd been sent it. I feel that when you're holding it you're holding a bit of history.\"When the slip went up for auction later that year, McCartney told the Associated Press: \"Eleanor Rigby is a totally fictitious character that I made up. If someone wants to spend money buying a document to prove a fictitious character exists, that's fine with me.\"This was released simultaneously on August 5, 1966 on both the album Revolver and as a double A-side with \"Yellow Submarine.\"The thrash band Realm covered this song on their 1988 album Endless War. It is a speed metal version of the song that got them signed to Roadrunner Records.McCartney told Q magazine June 2010 that after recording the song, he felt he could have done better. He recalled: \"I remember not liking the vocal on Eleanor Rigby, thinking, I hadn't nailed. I listen to it now and it's\u2026 very good. It's a bit annoying when you do Eleanor Rigby and you're not happy with it.\" Harmony The song is a prominent example of mode mixture, specifically between the Aeolian mode, also known as natural minor, and the Dorian mode. Set in E minor, the song is based on the chord progression Em-C, typical of the Aeolian mode and utilising notes \u266d3, \u266d6, and \u266d7 in this scale. The verse melody is written in Dorian mode, a minor scale with the natural sixth degree. \"Eleanor Rigby\" opens with a C-major vocal harmony (\"Aah, look at all ...\"), before shifting to E-minor (on \"lonely people\"). The Aeolian C-natural note returns later in the verse on the word \"dre-eam\" (C-B) as the C chord resolves to the tonic Em, giving an urgency to the melody's mood. The Dorian mode appears with the C# note (6 in the Em scale) at the beginning of the phrase \"in the church\". The chorus beginning \"All the lonely people\" involves the viola in a chromatic descent to the 5th; from 7 (D natural on \"All the lonely peo-\") to 6 (C\u266f on \"-ple\") to \u266d6 (C on \"they) to 5 (B on \"from\"). This is said to \"add an air of inevitability to the flow of the music (and perhaps to the plight of the characters in the song) Recording \"Eleanor Rigby\" does not have a standard pop backing. None of the Beatles played instruments on it, though John Lennon and George Harrison did contribute harmony vocals. Like the earlier song \"Yesterday\", \"Eleanor Rigby\" employs a classical string ensemble\u2014in this case an octet of studio musicians, comprising four violins, two violas, and two cellos, all performing a score composed by producer George Martin. Where \"Yesterday\" is played legato, \"Eleanor Rigby\" is played mainly in staccato chords with melodic embellishments. For the most part, the instruments \"double up\"\u2014that is, they serve as a single string quartet but with two instruments playing each of the four parts. Microphones were placed close to the instruments to produce a more vivid and raw sound; George Martin recorded two versions, one with and one without vibrato, the latter of which was used. McCartney's choice of a string backing may have been influenced by his interest in the composer Antonio Vivaldi, who wrote extensively for string instruments (notably \"the Four Seasons\"). Lennon recalled in 1980 that \"Eleanor Rigby\" was \"Paul's baby, and I helped with the education of the child ... The violin backing was Paul's idea. Jane Asher had turned him on to Vivaldi, and it was very good.\" The octet was recorded on 28 April 1966, in Studio 2 at Abbey Road Studios; it was completed in Studio 3 on 29 April and on 6 June. Take 15 was selected as the master. George Martin, in his autobiography All You Need Is Ears, takes credit for combining two of the vocal parts\u2014\"Ah! look at all the lonely people\" and \"All the lonely people\"\u2014having noticed that they would work together contrapuntally. He cited the influence of Bernard Herrmann's work on his string scoring. (Originally he cited the score for the film Fahrenheit 451, but this was a mistake as the film was not released until several months after the recording; Martin later stated he was thinking of Herrmann's score for Psycho.) The original stereo mix had McCartney's voice only in the right channel during the verses, with the string octet mixed to one channel, while the mono single and mono LP featured a more balanced mix. On the Yellow Submarine Songtrack and Love versions, McCartney's voice is centred and the string octet appears in stereo, creating a modern-sounding mix.

            "answer_text": "The song Eleanor Rigby is extremely sharp, but in a subtle way.We easily think it\u2019s about loneliness, but that\u2019s only part of the story. Eleanor Rigby is a lonely woman who\u2019s picking up rice in the church after a wedding, living in a dream. We know she will die in the church soon afterwards, we can imagine an old woman who dreams of her wedding that\u2019s now long in the past. She\u2019s recollecting memories long gone. At home Eleanor Rigby puts down her mask, shows her real face. But not at the window, she\u2019s pretending to be someone else when others might see her. The \u201cwho is it for?\u201d shows that there is no one to notice; she\u2019s so lonely that she does not even realise it. Father McKenzie is a priest (?) who\u2019s writing sermons for his empty church and darning his socks which people cannot see in his shoes. He\u2019s doing his duty, but there are no people to notice. Now the song becomes extremely sharp:Eleanor Rigby dies in church, Father McKenzie buries her in a nameless grave. He\u2019s the only one who attended the funeral and again it was his duty (he dug the grave). He didn\u2019t even know her name. The sharpness is that Father McKenzie is thinking he\u2019s doing his job but not seeing Eleanor Rigby\u2019s loneliness. She came to his church at least twice (wedding and when she died) to ward of her loneliness and he was busy with his sermons and socks. Even Father McKenzie was part of Eleanor\u2019s loneliness, he\u2019s so self absorbed he didn\u2019t even notice Eleanor and talk to her. Had he done that, he would have known her name. That\u2019s the reason no one is saved: Eleanor Rigby died lonely and Father McKenzie never realised he has forsaked his real duty. He wipes the dirt from his hands. Another job done. We now understand why his church is empty. The guy has no heart. He doesn\u2019t care about others. It\u2019s a massive accusation towards the Christian church, hidden in a song about a lonely woman and a lonely priest. ",
