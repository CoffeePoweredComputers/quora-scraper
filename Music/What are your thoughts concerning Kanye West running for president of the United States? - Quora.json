            "answer_text": "What are your thoughts on Kanye West running for president? Is this a joke? He seems serious. It really matters very little if Kanye West is \u201cserious\u201d about his run for president. It is a lot more complicated that he seems to be aware. First of all, Mr West will have to have his name placed on the ballots of all 50 states and there is a process that could be somewhat different in each state, about how to accomplish that task. It would require filling out applications, paying filing fees and respecting each state\u2019s deadline for filing. Not an easy task! Further, although I\u2019m sure that Mr West has \u2018more money than God\u2019, has some supporters like Elon Musk who are dedicated to his cause, and that West can afford to spend any amount of money between now and November 3rd on advertising, I wonder just how effective he will be in convincing over 60 million Americans that he is even \u2018serious\u2019 about wanting to be president, much less being PREPARED TO SERVE and smart enough to do the job. While it may not be \u201ca joke\u201d, it really does not seem to be a serious bid. Perhaps it is Kanye West\u2019s half-thought-out idea that he can \u2018use his celebrity\u2019 to draw some of the youth vote out and engage them in the process. It seems to be a fact of American politics that very few young people bother to vote. These citizens, aged 18 to nearly 30, do have the numbers to be a significant voting block, but they do not exercise that power. Considering how much influence upon our everyday lives that what happens in Washington D.C. exerts upon all of us, it is difficult for me to accept just how many American citizens of all ages ignore the politics and the politicians that hold so much power over our lives.

            "answer_text": "Few observations This is to help TrumpFirst he needs to have signature to run as an independent in each EACH state.Some states\u2019 deadline has passedHe only has a few days in a lot of statesThere is only 4 months to campaignI mean, unless he is senile he must know he wont win. And if he is senile shame on Kim for embarrassing her husband and father of her children like this. For a wife like this who needs to get married? No, this is no joke. Families must hide each other\u2019s weaknesses to protect each other. Otherwise, that is not love.You have got to be an idiot of epic proportions if you see him giving hug to DJT and ranting at WH and now running against him (essentially)Obviously he is trying to get few votes away from Biden.I am really worried that some horny first time teen voters may vote for him hoping to have Kim as the first lady.To those teenagers, you are likely to see her nudes if she is not the first lady so dont vote for Kanye because you think Kim is hot.",
