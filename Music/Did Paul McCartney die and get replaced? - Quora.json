In Taxman, George sings, \u201cMy advice for those that die \u2026\u201d meaning Paul. And at the end of Strawberry Fields, if you slow the record down, John sings, \u201cI buried Paul.\u201d In A Day In The Life, John tells us, \u201cHe Blew his mind our in a car \u2026\u201d And, most importantly, when the song is played backwards, you hear, \"Paul is dead, miss him, miss him.\u201d If you put a mirror in front of the Sgt. Pepper album cover, the words \u201cLonely Hearts\u201d on the drum logo reads as \"1 ONE 1 X HE DIE 1 ONE 1.\" The original cover of 1966's Yesterday and Today album featured The Lads amid raw meat and dismembered doll parts \u2014 clearly, symbolizing McCartney's gruesome motor accident. On the cover of Abbey Road, Paul is barefoot - a sure sign that he is dead. And the procession across the road is a funeral. John is all in white, like a clergyman. Ringo as the mourner, is dressed in black. George wears jeans, like a gravedigger. Also, \u2018this\u2019 Paul holds his ciggie in his right had, whereas real-Paul was left-handed. And in Magical Mystery Tour, to the song \u201cYour Mother Would Knew,\u201d the boys are coming down stairs all dressed in white \u2026 somehow that\u2019s futher proof, tho I forget why (edit: it\u2019s that Paul\u2019s carnation is black, the others\u2019 red). \u201cFake Paul\u201d married Linda Eastman of course \u2026 lucky boy. Let\u2019s see \u2026 What else? I forget, all these years later \u2014 but there are many clues that we all poured over circa 1966. All great, marvelous fun, and - of course - complete nonsense (shhh \u2026 don\u2019t tell anyone tho \u2026 and especially don\u2019t tell Paul - he\u2019s old now and the shock might \u201cblow his mind out\u201d).

Why on god\u2019s green earth would Paul\u2019s family, who were a very loving close group of people, go along with some scheme to say their son was still alive? How did they fake not having the pain and agony of losing the child, sibling, etc? they would have had to have been cold-hearted calculating evil people to have ever gone along with such a scheme. and that\u2019s just one thing\u2026..as many so called \u201creasons\u201d there are to believe Paul died, there are 1000x more reasons to prove he did not die. it\u2019s silly. it\u2019s nonsense. But, to still have this come up as conversation some 50 years later, just shows how impactful these 4 lads were on the world. ",
