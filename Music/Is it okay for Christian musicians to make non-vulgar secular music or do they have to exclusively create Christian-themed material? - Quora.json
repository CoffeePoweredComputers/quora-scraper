            "answer_text": "Doctrinally speaking, there is nothing in the way of \u201cthou shalts\u201d about this, regardless of whether this question is asking about Christian musicians or Christian musicians, because there is a distinction between the two. In terms of music culture and fandom, I would say that there is a risk to the one\u2019s musical career any time some sort of crossover is attempted. A Christian musician who records music with secular appeal and without an overt Gospel message runs the risk of being accused by his/her Christian fan base of compromising spiritual convictions for the sake of greater, worldly fame. A Christian musician otherwise known for secular music and who is \u201couted\u201d as a Bible believer runs a similar risk of alienating fans who are hostile to Christianity as a matter of personal principle and find the disclosure off-putting . And for this latter group, I would encourage them to remember Jesus\u2019s words in Matthew 5:15 concerning openness about one\u2019s faith: Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. Personally I am fan of a little known niche of music that consists of Christian musicians who make pro-Gospel music that does in fact use a little vulgarity to point us back toward the cross. Consider 16 Horsepower\u2019s song \u201cBlack Bush\u201d I can sense it all around me There's somethin' in this room It ain't magic nor no witchcraft No bitch on no broom Look see his bones are gone He done left the grave The grip of death it could not hold him down no It's for him that I rave Or \u201cLast Song About Satan\u201d by Slim Cessna\u2019s Auto Club. I was at the Lion's Lair and who did I sit next to there but SatanHe ordered me a beer, and He looked me in the eyeHe said he was my friend, I knew that was a lieHe's the man behind my sins I seem to fall because of HimG___damn I hate Him. So this is my last song about SatanSo I say Lucifer you piece of shit I should kick your ass right where you sitAll the hell you put me through, my Mother cries because of You Granted, this kind of music will be objectionable to many mainstream Christians, but on the other hand it reaches many people where they live, in much more honest and less milquetoast terms. Please refer to my related answers below for additional consideration: Who are some celebrities that are devout Christians? Why don\u2019t Christian music stations play popular songs with obvious Christians themes by more secular artists (Carrie Underwood- Jesus Take the Wheel)? Why do you like or not like Christian music? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. I have a favorite artist. He\u2019s a rapper and goes by the name of NF. He\u2019s a Christian, but he doesn\u2019t like people labeling him as a Christian rapper. He\u2019s a rapper who happens to be a Christian. Here\u2019s some lyrics to one of his songs called, Intro 2  I'm back, did anyone miss me?They said a second record could be trickyWell that's kind of funny 'cause I am not trippingMy fans, they know what it is and they with meYeah, I ain't the type that's gon' ride with the semiI came from a town with three lakes and no cityI've been doing shows for nothing but penniesWhen I leave the stage, they never forget meMansion was a glimpse of my lifeI let you see what it's like to be in my headPeople ask me what I think I think I be doin'If it wasn't music, I'd rather be deadYou heard what I said, that was like me at a 3, you don't want to see me at 10Or maybe you doI promise if that is the case, then that is what you're gonna getIf you're looking for music with watered down lyricsI promise that you need to go somewhere elseAnd if you want somebody to tell you everything that you wanna hear I won't be any helpThis flow is familiar, I think I heard it beforeOh yeah, I made it myselfI left the door open to come in my mansion but I never said it's a beautiful houseSome of ya'll sat on the porchLooked at my windows and stared at my doorThey ask me if I'm going to kill it this recordI laugh in their face and I ask 'em, \"Do you see the blood on the floor?\"  He has a few songs that people would label as Christian, but ultimately, he\u2019s just a Christian who raps. Mind you, he never cusses in his songs either. He keeps it clean, yet if you don\u2019t known what he\u2019s talking about. You might say he can be violent and aggressive in some songs.  ",
