            "answer_text": "Honestly, if you were to take it on an international scale, EXO is very underrated and BTS is very very very popular. But pretty much the reverse happens in South Korea. They favour EXO more than they do for BTS. This is probably because of the size of the production companies they come from. SM is HUGE in SK. But BigHit isn't as huge. Also, EXO debuted couple of years before BTS did. So, people there are more familiar with EXO and their style than they are with BTS. But if you're talking on a general scale, Kpop doesn't really \u201cfavour\u201d any group. It depends on the fandoms. Whatever we're listening to/supporting more. There's no bias/partiality. The one with better content and music goes to better places. Both groups are equally wonderful. ",

            "answer_text": "Kpop doesn't favor any particular group? EXO has been popular since 2013 and their fanbase is evergrowing. They also had a massive hit with their song \u201cGrowl\u201d and since many of their members are active in solo dramas and stuff, they are more recognized among the Korean public. Plus they have maintained their image of being goodlooking men with good voices and technique, and consistency in the quality and success of heir music all these years. A lot of people (including me) were introduced to kpop by EXO. That's why they have many kpop fans who respect and side with them. ",
