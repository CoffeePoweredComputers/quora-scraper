            "answer_text": "Vocal quality can deteriorate with general fatigue and dehydration as well as from overuse. After a long day of speaking, being in a dry environment (central heating or air con) or eating large meals (causing reflux) our voices can dry out, get raspy and generally be of poor quality. It is a common occurrence. To help prevent this from happening make sure you stay well hydrated throughout the day, don't eat heavy meals or drink too much alcohol during the evening before you sing and try to maintain a good humidity level in the environment if it's really dry (try a humidifier or steamer).  Limit the amount of speaking you do during the day if you're singing that evening. It is often our speaking voice, rather than our singing voice that causes the most fatigue on the cords.  ",

            "answer_text": "Probably the body is tired, and your mind is less focused than during the daytime. At night you are supposed to sleep and get some rest.  If you have already practiced a lot during the day, or have straining speaking habits and have been speaking a lot, the voice may just be tired and need a break. Then a good night sleep is the best thing. Practice on those times of day when you have energy. It does not help you if you do it when you are tired, you just develop bad habits. It's not the quantity but the quality of practice that counts, you need to repeat correct things. If you have to perform a late night gig, learn to pace the day so that you save your energy, rest during the day, maybe take a nap on the afternoon. ",
