            "answer_text": "Long form. There are short prog classics, but 5 to 20 minutes is pretty standard. Complex form. Rather than dwell on blues progressions, prog will visit edgy modernist harmonies, odd times and polyrhythms, and the idea of \"movements\". Nonstandard instrumentation. In addition to standard rock quartet instruments, you will see Chapman Sticks, ethno-orchestral percussion, six string basses, flutes, and so on. High level of individual and band proficiency. Mystical/exotic lyrics. This runs the gamut from the cheek of Bohemian Rhapsody to the Siberian Khatrus and whatnot by Yes to King Crimson's more nonsensical stuff. Fewer songs about fast cars and faster women. Elaborate album covers and stagecraft. Pop crossover. Nobody wants to admit it, but you can find proggy elements all over the place: the '70s art rock that helped inspire punk and New Wave, Springsteen, metal, '70s AOR, EWF, Stevie Wonder, late Beatles, electronic/trip hop/ambient/EDM.

            "answer_text": "The most important quality for the progressive rock should be experiment with the sound. When you listen Progressive Rock, you can find elements of many genres like jazz, folk, soul, blues, rock, synth, metal and maybe, you won't believe but pop as well. I think, one has to listen many genres to cultivate that quality and make the music that blends various genres into one.  ",
