            "answer_text": "I hate San Francisco. It is my least favorite big city. My reasons echo those of other responders, but my hatred for the city merits repetition and hopefully serves as a warning for people considering moving to San Francisco. 1. San Francisco is always infuriatingly chilly. I grew up in Anchorage, Alaska, and I am utterly depressed by the weather in San Francisco, especially during the summer. Sure, San Franciscan winters are balmy compared to winters in many other places on the planet, as temperatures rarely drop below 40 degrees and hover around 50 degrees most of the time, but summers temperatures also hover around 50 degrees. That's the infuriating part. And the wind never stops. So essentially, you'll rarely get to wear a T-shirt outside, even in July. If you're into being mildly bundled up and shivering year-round, as many people (for some reason) are, you'll like San Francisco, but if you're into warmth and happiness and respecting yourself, stay away. 2. San Francisco is filthy and has way too many homeless people. Onany given day, in any part of the city (even the relatively gentrified neighborhoods), you are apt to step in dog or human shit on the sidewalk if you're not careful. In most neighborhoods, you will be woken up in the middle of the night by thedrug-and-mental-disease-fueled screams of the homeless. And if you'reanywhere near downtown, you will be assaulted by the smell of human urine and badgered for free change at every street corner and subway entrance. Enough said. 3. Public transportation sucks in San Francisco. BART is fast enough, but if you venture places where BART doesn't go (which is most of the city), you're stuck on a bus that travels at an average of 8 miles/hour (http://sfpublicpress.org/news/2010-11/muni-planners-say-speed-to-come-from-untangling-messy-streetscape) and is, more often than not, infested with smelly, crazy homeless people who will verbally harass you. Last semester, I took a bus every day to school, which was 4 miles from my apartment. It would take me a full hour to get there via bus. 4. Rent in San Francisco is expensive relative to the quality of housing. Expect to pay well over $1000/month (and probably closer to $2000/month, utilities non-inclusive) if you want to live in a decent place reasonably close to (i.e., less than a 1-hour commute from) downtown. Even at that price, your apartment will not be like the nice, clean, spacious, suburban house you probably grew up in. The floorboards will creak, the carpet will smell funny, the rooms will be tiny, the stairs too narrow, and the walls/ceilings/floors so thin that you will know exactly what your neighbors are up to at any given point in time.  5. Everything in San Francisco is run-down and dirty. This is a corollary to [4]. Everything and everybody--from the apartments people pay $2000/month to live in to the parks covered in dog and human feces to the streets littered with garbage to the \"quaint\" shops lining the streets to most people outside the financial district--is in sore need of a bar of soap and a makeover.  6. San Francisco has way too many hipsters. This might not be a problem for some people, but it is a problem for me because I am not a hipster and do not like hipsters.  7. People in San Francisco don't dress up. When I go to a nice restaurant for dinner, I like to put on a nice dress and heels. This is not done. Girls and guys (especially guys) get away with showing up at nice restaurants and events in T-shirts, jeans, and sneakers all the time. For many San Franciscans, \"dressing up\" entails putting on their \"nice\" sneakers. It is the norm and, in my opinion, offensive.  There are 2 general exceptions to the casual dress code: if you're going clubbing or to the symphony/opera/ballet. ",

            "answer_text": "The answers here are accurate/hilarious.  I won't reiterate what has already been said but is completely accurate - lack of adequate public transportation, prohibitive cost of living, pretentious closed-minded people masquerading as an open-minded city.  Instead I'll relate a little of my personal experience: I moved to SF from Kansas, like so many other college-graduate Midwesterners whose \"minds have been opened, man\" by their liberal college professors.  Therein lies part of the problem with San Francisco - hundreds of kids every year move there to find some sort of liberal, hipster mecca, only to realize the SF of the '60's is dead (or has at least moved to Portland).  There seems to be a revolving cast of starry-eyed youths, stoners, homeless-on-purpose kids, and hipsters revolving through the city, each assuming they are something special and unique.  It gives the city quite a vapid feel. As far as native San Franciscoans (or at least those who had lived there for a while), their California-centric attitudes were alternately amusing and sickening.  Growing up in the Midwest, you have the impression that people on the coasts are a little more worldly, more educated, more understanding.  NOT TRUE.  People in SF are just as closed-minded and ignorant as some of those in the smallest Kansas town.  I'm recalling one conversation with a coworker which revealed her complete lack of geography skills (you're from Kansas?  Shouldn't you have more of an accent?  What do you do for fun?  Like, hang out in Atlanta?)   I always thought the people I grew up around in Kansas were the ones who would assume things about someone without getting to know them.  Surely people in SF were more open-minded than that, right?  Wrong - many of the people I worked with automatically assumed I was a dumb, ignorant hick (a serious insult to someone who thought she just moved away from the dumb, ignorant hicks).  They assumed I must be anti-gay.  One guy even asked me if I had ever met a gay person before.  WTF?  Ok, news flash, but there are plenty of openly-gay people in Kansas.  Yeah, there are occasional hate-crimes in the Midwest, but that sets us apart from San Francisco how???  There are ignorant people everywhere, unfortunately.   It all would have been fine if they had taken the time to get to know me, but people in SF are way too cool/busy/pretentious for that.  Everybody's watching out for #1, because that's what you do out there.  Don't go there expecting people to embrace you with open arms and help you find your way.   Regarding nightlife (music, bars, etc.)  I wasn't that impressed.  San Francisco gets tons of great shows, yes....but WHO has the money to go see them???  Not me!  Which hearkens back to the points some of the previous posters were making - you have to be a millionaire to have a good time in that city.  Otherwise you are just struggling and becoming more bitter by the day.  Going out to a concert means dropping at LEAST $100, between the ticket, cab ride to and from, and drinks.  Cover for special holiday parties (like New Year's Eve) starts at about $75 and goes up from there.  Going out to a bar is just about as bad - expect to pay $8 per drink average (and that's if you're going to cheap places!), plus cover, plus at least $40 on cab fare.  When you're struggling to pay your $1000+ rent every month, how can you afford any of that \"awesome\" night life?   And to be honest, I never experienced anything in SF nightlife that was any different than any other city, big or small.  I can go out in Lawrence, KS, spend less than $20, get home easily, and have a great time!  I remember going home to visit some friends before Halloween one year, and they took me to see a band at the Bottleneck in Lawrence.  We spent less than $20, had a great time, got to meet the band, and got home at the end of the night in less than 10 minutes (never take that for granted).  The next week the SAME band played a show on Treasure Island.  My friend went, spent well over $150, and came home complaining about what an awful time it was.   I could probably go on and on, but I will just wrap this up by noting some things I will never take for granted again:  Kansas traffic.  Being able to park most places for free.  Actually being able to find parking! (There are actually MORE cars in SF than parking spaces!!  Which means if you are unlucky enough to be looking for parking when most people are home, say, when you get off work at 3am, you are out of luck).  $3 parking tickets (as opposed to $65 in SF).  Not having to move my car every 2 hours/move for the street cleaner.  FRIENDLY PEOPLE.  A strong middle class (SF has no middle class to speak of).  Cheap drinks.  Good friends who aren't total pretentious fakers.  Good friends who don't feel the need to constantly \"out-cool\" each other.    Comparatively cheap rent and groceries.   So, people from SF, you can continue to think whatever you want about Kansas.  I really don't care.  I've seen your s***, and it DOES stink. ",
