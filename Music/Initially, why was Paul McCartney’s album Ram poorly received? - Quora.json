            "answer_text": "When you were once in the greatest Rock Band in history and leave of course everything you do will be put under a microscope. Paul was not the only victim of this as all 4 former Beatles were always judged against the band they were once a part of although the critics were kinder in their reviews of the other 3\u2019s latest efforts. I think the fact that John had spoken out about the album didn\u2019t help either calling it muzak to his ears. Clearly no single one of the Beatles alone is as good as they were as a band. The critics were critical for that reason and the fact that many blame Paul for the split so in some ways the reviews became a vehicle for personal attacks against Paul instead of being an objective review of the album. Funny thing about critics is that their views often times are not accepted by the album buying public as Ram hit number 1 in the UK charts and number 2 in the US charts. It stayed in the top ten for over 5 months and went platinum. It also gave Paul his first number 1 hit since leaving the Beatles. Oddly enough after initially being bashed by the critics years later most critics have changed their opinion and many call it one of the best albums McCartney has ever put out. On a personal note I bought this album when it came out as I did when McCartney came out and enjoyed both very much and I found it to be exactly what I would expect from a McCartney album. His writing style did not really change much after he left the Beatles and had the Beatles stayed together chances are a few of the songs on the album very well could have been Beatles songs. ",

            "answer_text": "Rock critics, angry at Paul for supposedly breaking up the Beatles (it was Lennon who actually quit the group but kept quiet) chose to overlook Paul\u2019s fresh approach. They also chose to attack Linda for sharing the credit for the album with Paul. Lennon Starr and Harrison all chose to attack Paul through his music. Lennon wrote the song How Do You Sleep about Paul with George and Yoko adding jabs. Despite all the bad publicity the album sold well and the fans knew what a fine album they had bought. Over the years the album has risen in popularity and reviews now hold the album in high regard! \u201cSome commentators consider it to be one of McCartney's finest solo works. The 2012 reissue received an aggregate score of 86 out of 100 from Metacritic, based on twelve reviews \u2013 a score that the website defines as indicating \"universal acclaim\" AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote: \"in retrospect it looks like nothing so much as the first indie pop album, a record that celebrates small pleasures with big melodies\". Pitchfork Media's Jayson Greene called Ram \"a domestic-bliss album, one of the weirdest, earthiest, and most honest ever made\". Simon Vozick-Levinson of Rolling Stone dubbed it a \"daffy masterpiece\" and \"a grand psychedelic ramble full of divine melodies and orchestral frippery\". Quite a change from the reviews in the 70\u2019s. ",
