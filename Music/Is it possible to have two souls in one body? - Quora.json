Now shadows of a second consciousness, be it a past life or something else dark can sometimes be intruding in a person\u2019s energy field is possible, but karmic law directs only one karmic entity per body. As for pregnant clients, the baby has a separate and distinct energy field, which is inhabited part time until the third trimester, but a full consciousness does not really exist until birth, and then full karmic consciousness does not come until your late 30s to 40s. I have never seen it, nor can conceive a reason why it would, and should it occur, the surplus consciousness would have no karmic reason why it should not be removed. ",

            "answer_text": "I've always felt this way, like someone or someones else inhabited my body with me. Why so many contradicting thoughts and beliefs? Societies\u2019 doings, am I weak or dumb? I don't think so anymore. The personas come from somewhere, be it in my genes, archetypes, soul, spirits, whatever it is, there is much more than just me. Notice, I didn't say psyche, that's because psychology tries, but there is much that it doesn't explain definitively. For instance, what are dreams, where do they come from? I\u2019ve heard people explain the subconscious, but that's like saying we've explored The Mariana Trench. I've been thinking about a practice that incorporates the sciences, the schools of thought, religions, with all the arts and spirit relevant to current times and history, without the old dogmas\u2019 constraints. I incorporate all things and the nothings as well, since at heart, I admit, nothing can be truly proven real less than sensation and perception. I would like a metapsychology perhaps or a metascience, because the sciences still can't explain a lot. Why? Different form, different science. ",
