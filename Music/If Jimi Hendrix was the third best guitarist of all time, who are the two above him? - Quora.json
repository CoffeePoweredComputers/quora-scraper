            "answer_text": "Are you trying to make people sound silly? Jimis touch ( quick example- little wing he plays that song with so many different degrees of attacking the strings to just barely brushing them wow and left handed on a right handed axe , restrung!!) and jimi got so much tonal variations with limited effects available at that time. Frying up tube amps was one of his go to effects I guess . Listen to red house , studio version , u can hear the amps overdriven, protesting loudly humming buzzing popping! He used all to his advantage !!! No one else played like this before him. So who could just consider better since then ! If I had to save my life by answering truthfully my number one guitar slinger ( except Hendrix) no doubt, Jeff Beck no one, no one can get out of a guitar the sounds, the way he pulls the notes like they are stretch Armstrong . And he never uses a pic. Even Clapton said about Jeff Beck\u201d I don\u2019t know how he does it\u201d! Second best would be I\u2019m going to have to say it\u2019s a 2 way tie between Prince and jimmy Page. Third third In my opinion Stevie Ray Vaughn just about five or six yards ahead of John Staehely and johns still rockin with dead pyrates society and that man , John Staehely can pay the living snot out of a guitar . Hell he maybe moved up list by now ",

            "answer_text": "Not sure what list you are referring to that has Jimi #3. I\u2019ve never seen him ranked anything other than #1. The problem with any ranking is that it\u2019s totally subjective. Also, there are many styles of guitar that are never even considered in such lists: classical, Spanish, flamenco, jazz. There are some classical guitar players that literally take your breath away. Thus, Jimi can properly only be described as \u201cthe best rock/blues guitarist of all time.\u201d In that light, and with that qualification, were you to arbitrarily put Jimi at #3, you would then bump up #2 and #3 ahead of him. Most lists would give you Clapton at #1 and Page at #2. There are a handful of other guys that would vie for this spots depending on preference. Some people love the \u201cshredders\u201d others the technical guys like Steve Vai. Other people look at who was the most influential, pushed the guitar to new places, had the most innovative sound, etc. No one will agree since different things appeal to different people. But, for argument sake, there was no one like Clapton. Technically flawless, soulful, and moving. Page gave us some of the greatest licks, solos and rhythms in rock history. His brain sometimes got ahead of his fingers and he got sloppy, which is why Clapton is ahead of him. But in the studio, Page was a GOD. ",
