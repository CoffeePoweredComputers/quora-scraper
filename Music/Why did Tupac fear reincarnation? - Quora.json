            "answer_text": "Tupac\u2019s reasoning for the fear of reincarnation does not seem to have a clear cut answer it seems to be only derived by contextual evidence built around his previous interviews and songs. For this reason the answer I give very well could be wrong if Tupac ever saw it but this is how i perceive the reason for why tupac feared reincarnation: he had this need for his music, his words, him as an artist, and as a black man growing up in the United States to be forever immortalized in all of our hearts and if a mans spirit simply reincarnated then after death his music his spirit would pass onto being another form and be too busy dealing with the issues of the physical world instead of his spirit ensuring his music being in all our hearts and minds. Best evidence i have for this position would be in his lyrics for reincarnation \u201cMy only fear of death, is reincarnation I use my last breath, to reach the whole nation\u201d if reincarnation did happen to Pac then that would mean his music wasn't his last breath and he is still in this world as another creature on this planet.

            "answer_text": "he has mentioned this fear several times in his songs, assuming he meant what he wrote i think we can conclude \u201cyes\u201d he did. But another big fear of him based on his interviews was his fear of being forgotten both as a musician and as a human being. Given he is a legend in the hip hop community, at least that fear of being forgotten he doesn\u2019t have to fear, despite he is no longer with us\u2026.if that makes any sense. ",
