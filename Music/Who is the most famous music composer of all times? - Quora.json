            "answer_text": "ok, I guess there are a couple of ways to handle this correctly. we are not looking for the best composers, but the most famous ones. Handel and Haydn became a bit famous. Bach only later on after Mendessohn revived his music for the public. Beethoven was quite famous, and Liszt (maybe paganini too) was probably the first virtuoso composer musician to be treated like a celebrity rock star. Wagner had a cult of followers, and Tchaikovsky was incredibly popular worldwide. Rachmaninoff was pretty popular as well. Starting with Mahler and the development of contemporary music composers were popular with smaller groups but not the overwhelming population, who moved to pop music. Nowadays composers who make film and musical scores like John Williams, Leonard Bernstein, Stephen Sondheim, and Andrew Lloyd Webber are quite famous. But literally the most famous music composers of all time must be the Beatles, especially Lennon/McCartney. We have definitive proof of how many times their music has been played and purchased and published over the years, it\u2019s hard data. I think they are the most famous on the planet due to the hard data, enduring legacy, and international recognition of their faces, names, and music worldwide for several generations. ",

            "answer_text": "Gotta be Beethoven. He fulfils every clich\u00e9 of the tortured genius, his life story makes fantastic reading, his private tragedy adds pathos; and, crucially, his genius is undeniable, wide in application and rich in profundity. His music is famous, and much of it has gained life far beyond the concert hall. He wrote works in every musical form, and raised several to the level of philosophy in music. Like Einstein, the classic image of him is so memorable as to immediately grant a measure of depth to a situation. And composers are even today defined in relation to his achievements. He towers above all rivals, and certainly knew his own worth, yet his humanity never failed to be an inspiration. And he wrote maybe 5, certainly between 5 and 10, of the most recognisable pieces of music in the whole of human history. 5th Symphony, 1st movement9th Symphony, 4th movementF\u00fcr ElisePiano Sonata No. 14 \"Moonlight\", 1st movementPiano Sonata No. 8 \"Pathetique\", 2nd movement7th Symphony, 2nd movementViolin Sonata No. 5 \"Spring\", 1st movementPiano Sonata No. 23 \"Appassionata\", 1st movementViolin Concerto, 2nd movementTurkish March (arr. piano) ",
