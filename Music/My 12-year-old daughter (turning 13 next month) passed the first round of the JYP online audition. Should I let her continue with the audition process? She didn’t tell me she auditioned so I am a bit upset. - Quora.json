            "answer_text": "First of all, congratulations to your daughter. JYP Entertainment is a big company so passing the auditions is quite an achievement. She wouldn\u2019t have given the auditions if she wasn\u2019t passionate about being an idol. And she wouldn\u2019t have passed the first round if she didn\u2019t have any talent. You will miss her childhood. And she will lose her childhood too. You know your child the best. Still, allow her to continue the audition process. It is justified that you are upset that she didn\u2019t inform you about auditioning though. If she passes all the rounds, then allow her to accept the company\u2019s proposal if she is optimistic, strong and hard-working enough to stay in dorms and put her best efforts for the rest of her life, and you are strong enough to let her go. If not, then I suggest that she must audition again after two or three years, when she is 14 or 15. But there are some things you must know about the K-Pop world. Most answers here already have talked about those points and yes, those points are true. But some of those points do not apply to JYP Entertainment. JYPE doesn\u2019t care much about body figure and beauty. The company doesn\u2019t but some managers do. Tell your daughter that she must stand up for herself if her manager tries to take control of her face and body figure.Dating ban only exists till the first three years after debut.JYPE does overwork their artists, but they prioritize their health (both mental and physical) when they realize that their career is affecting their health. I\u2019m not denying that they overwork their idols. They obviously do. But they know when to stop overworking them.JYPE is quite careless about sasaengs (obsessive stalker fans). This is their major flaw. Tell your daughter to get police protection or even request more body guards from the company if she ever experiences things like this.Agencies pay for everything. If your daughter wants to quit, she will have to pay everything back. This holds true if she is in JYP too.JYPE is quite open to foreign trainees, unlike most companies that resent foreign idols/trainees.I\u2019m not saying that JYP or JYPE is perfect. They certainly do have their own flaws. But I think it is much safer for your daughter to get into JYP than the other K-Pop companies. Sure, most K-Pop companies are corrupted but there are some companies which are less corrupted; and JYPE is one of those agencies. If you mentioned another K-Pop company other than JYP, YG, SM or BigHit Labels, I would have straight up told no for the answer. But since it is a big company, she will have an 70\u201390% chance of being successful. But there it is not any guarantee that your daughter is going to debut any soon. Idols\u2019 training period ranges from one day to about twelve years. Tell her to never stop on improving her skills. Wanting to protect your child is natural. It proves that you are a very affectionate and dutiful parent. But think about one question. Isn\u2019t preparing your child for hardships better than protecting them from hardships? Won\u2019t it make them stronger individuals than vulnerable individuals? There are many people who regret being idols. But there are also many idols who are happy with their decisions.   Take both kinds of experiences into account. Discuss them with your daughter. Both of you must make the decision. Guide her as much as possible, but make sure she will be responsible for her own decisions. Here is one more video which might help:  ",

            "answer_text": "Hi! I'm 12 as well, turning 13 in early May, and also auditioning for jyp, next summer though. I get you are upset, because if I was in your shoes I would be upset as well. But I would also be proud. Here's why. Jyp is one of the Big 3 kpop companies. The big 3 is the nickname for the top 3 kpop companies, as of now. They're made up of: YG- BLACKPINK, 2NE1, BIGBANG, TREASURE SM- Red Velvet, SHINee, EXO, NCT JYP- Twice, ITZY, Stray Kids, NiziU, BoyStory, Day6, Got7, Wonder Girls, MissA, 2PM, 2AM The founder, former CEO, and currently chairman, is J.Y Park. He is an \u201cidol\u201d himself, even at 48 years old. He isn't as active as he was when he was younger, releasing music about once a year. His most recent song is a duet with one of his former idols under his company, called \u201cWhen We Disco\u201d. It's really good, I recommend it. His most successful girl groups are Twice (debuted October 2015) and ITZY (debuted Feburary 2019). His most successful boy groups are Stray Kids (Started in a survival show named the same thing in late 2017, officially debuted March 2018, in October 2019, Woojin left the group due to \u201cpersonal reasons\", look him up and there are tons of articles after the incident) and Got7 (debuted 2014). Jyp is known for mistreating his boy groups, except for Stray Kids. He overworks his girl groups and Stray Kids, which these things angers jyp fans constantly, like me, and also sexualizes underage idols, but he doesn't do this as often as he did during Sixteen, which is what formed Twice. But he makes sure his idols and trainee are healthy, mentally and physically. He knows that because the parents of the trainees and idols let their children go to a new city, country, or even continent by themselves, to a strangers company, he should take care of them. There are no weight diets, if you are underweight for your age he makes sure you eat more, if you are a little overweight he makes sure you slim down a little. You can watch the \u201cJyp 2.0\u201d press conference on the official YouTube channel. During the end of the month evaluations, it's really just a big celebration that you've gotten through the month, and you get to rest and hang out with friends. Getting into one of the Big 3 is extremely hard. Whoever watched her audition video saw something in her that they probably didn't see in others, she stood out. 1-3 people are accepted into JYP every month or so, she's lucky. And about school, she will be sent to an international school if she doesn't understand, speak, and write korean fluently, or she will be tutored for Korean and other school subjects. This is all I have for now, if both of us get in, I hope we can be close friends, good luck to her!! Support her as much as you can!! Edit: Guys, may you please be respectful and give me constructive criticism, or none at all? The comments seemed kind of rude to me\ud83e\udd7a ",
