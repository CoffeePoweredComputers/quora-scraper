            "answer_text": "Oh I do. Saw it on tv when I was just a child, and fell in love with that haunting music, Polonaise. It was a lovely movie, etched indelibly in my mind when I was but 5 or 6 years old. Cornel Wilde as Chopin, and the exquisite Merle Oberon as George Sand. How could I ever forget such a memorable movie. Yet, I\u2019ve only seen in twice in my life - when I was that wee child, and remembering it, looked to find it again to watch as an adult. I recognized both actors, the advantage of growing up in an entertainment family where we talked about such things. And there was another musical film that left the same impression, The Eddie Duchin Story, with, if I recall, the twin grands with his son playing off at the end of the film. I\u2019d had a great desire to learn to play the piano after both of those but it never came to be. Perhaps why I still love the sound of the piano. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I can. (I\u2019m that old!) It is a lavish, and, towards the end, very tragic film biography of Chopin, made in 1945. It was a few years afterwards that it screened in Australia. As a young piano student at the time, I thought it was great. I will always remember towards the end, Chopin coughing while he was playing, and a splash of blood hit the piano keys. TB (tuberculosis) was a big issue at the time in Victoria, Australia. As children we were heavily instructed in sneezing and coughing hygiene with TB as the big threat. This was before the vaccine.I notice that ASTR is now available on YouTube. I must give it another look. ",
