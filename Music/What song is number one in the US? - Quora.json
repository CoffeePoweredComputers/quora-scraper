            "answer_text": "For modern country music probably this one: Friends in Low Places - Garth Brooks  It doesn\u2019t matter who you are or where in the United States. This lovely little earworm is so pervasive that you literally can not end up hearing it somewhere, especially at sporting events. For older country probably this: Ring of Fire - Johnny Cash  This has been used in so many movies, TV shows, commercials and covered so much, that pretty much everyone knows it. Some others that are really well known: Jolene - Dolly Parton He Stopped Loving Her Today - George Jones Mommas Don\u2019t Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys - Willie Nelson Take Me Home Country Roads - John Denver Rhinestone Cowboy - Glen Campbell Crazy - Patsy Cline The Gambler - Kenny Rogers I Will Always Love You - Dolly Parton (More known because of the remake though) Fancy - Reba McIntire There are a lot more, but these are going to be the most known across the US. The farther into the Southern US you go, the more country music people will know as it is generally the more popular style. ",

            "answer_text": "There exist several different measures of a song's commercial popularity in the United States. The Billboard Hot 100 tracks both sales and radio play for singles and is done weekly. You could also look at what songs are #1 on the iTunes store and Amazon MP3 store, which are the two most popular online music stores in the country. I'm not sure how often these charts are re-calculated, but it is definitely more frequently than once a week. These rankings of songs will often differ significantly, but as of today, March 13th 2012, the #1 song on all three of these rankings is 'We Are Young (feat. Janelle Mon\u00e1e)' by Fun. So you could say that this song is pretty definitively the top song in the United States today.
