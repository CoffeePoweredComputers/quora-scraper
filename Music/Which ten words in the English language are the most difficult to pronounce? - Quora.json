            "answer_text": "I\u2019m an englishman and reckon I can have a good crack at most words without too much difficulty. I imagine the biggest challenge to a non-native speaker must be the lack of consistency in the rules about how to pronounce words. The following poem always makes me smile, although it may perplex the non-native contingent! Dearest creature in creation,Study English pronunciation.I will teach you in my verseSounds like corpse, corps, horse, and worse. I will keep you, Suzy, busy, Make your head with heat grow dizzy. Tear in eye, your dress will tear.So shall I! Oh hear my prayer.Just compare heart, beard, and heard, Dies and diet, lord and word, Sword and sward, retain and Britain. (Mind the latter, how it\u2019s written.) Now I surely will not plague you With such words as plaque and ague. But be careful how you speak: Say break and steak, but bleak and streak; Cloven, oven, how and low,Script, receipt, show, poem, and toe.Hear me say, devoid of trickery, Daughter, laughter, and Terpsichore, Typhoid, measles, topsails, aisles, Exiles, similes, and reviles;Scholar, vicar, and cigar,Solar, mica, war and far;One, anemone, Balmoral,Kitchen, lichen, laundry, laurel; Gertrude, German, wind and mind, Scene, Melpomene, mankind.Billet does not rhyme with ballet, Bouquet, wallet, mallet, chalet. Blood and !ood are not like food, Nor is mould like should and would. Viscous, viscount, load and broad, Toward, to forward, to reward. And your pronunciation\u2019s OKWhen you correctly say croquet,Rounded, wounded, grieve and sieve, Friend and fiend, alive and live.Ivy, privy, famous; clamourAnd enamour rhyme with hammer.River, rival, tomb, bomb, comb,Doll and roll and some and home.Stranger does not rhyme with anger, Neither does devour with clangour.Souls but foul, haunt but aunt,Font, front, wont, want, grand, and grant, Shoes, goes, does. Now first say finger, And then singer, ginger, linger,Real, zeal, mauve, gauze, gouge and gauge, Marriage, foliage, mirage, and age.Query does not rhyme with very,Nor does fury sound like bury.Dost, lost, post and doth, cloth, loth.Job, nob, bosom, transom, oath.Though the differences seem little,We say actual but victual. Refer does not rhyme with deafer. Foeffer does, and zephyr, heifer. Mint, pint, senate and sedate; Dull, bull, and George ate late. Scenic, Arabic, Pacific, Science, conscience, scientific.Liberty, library, heave and heaven,Rachel, ache, moustache, eleven.We say hallowed, but allowed,People, leopard, towed, but vowed.Mark the differences, moreover,Between mover, cover, clover;Leeches, breeches, wise, precise,Chalice, but police and lice;Camel, constable, unstable,Principle, disciple, label.Petal, panel, and canal,Wait, surprise, plait, promise, pal.Worm and storm, chaise, chaos, chair, Senator, spectator, mayor.Tour, but our and succour, four.Gas, alas, and Arkansas.Sea, idea, Korea, area,Psalm, Maria, but malaria.Youth, south, southern, cleanse and clean. Doctrine, turpentine, marine.Compare alien with Italian,Dandelion and battalion.Sally with ally, yea, ye,Eye, I, ay, aye, whey, and key.Say aver, but ever, fever,Neither, leisure, skein, deceiver.Heron, granary, canary.Crevice and device and aerie.Face, but preface, not efface.Phlegm, phlegmatic, ass, glass, bass.Large, but target, gin, give, verging,Ought, out, joust and scour, scourging.Ear, but earn and wear and tearDo not rhyme with here but ere.Seven is right, but so is even,Hyphen, roughen, nephew Stephen,Monkey, donkey, Turk and jerk,Ask, grasp, wasp, and cork and work. Pronunciation (think of Psyche!)Is a paling stout and spikey?Won\u2019t it make you lose your wits,Writing groats and saying grits?It\u2019s a dark abyss or tunnel:Strewn with stones, stowed, solace, gunwale, Islington and Isle of Wight,Housewife, verdict and indict.Finally, which rhymes with enough,Though, through, plough, or dough, or cough? Hiccough has the sound of cup.My advice is to give up!! ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure you could name any one particular English word as being the hardest to pronounce. (I originally was asked what is the one most difficult word, not ten.) \u201cSquirrel\u201d and \u201cmarshmallow\u201d are incredibly hard for German speakers, apparently. \u201cRural\u201d would be excruciating for someone Japanese. \u201cWorcestershire\u201d (as in the sauce) trips up a lot of native English speakers if they don\u2019t know it is \u2018worst-er-sure\u2019 (alternatively \u2018woost-ah-sure\u2019). But I don\u2019t think giving a place name is fair. I think there are two contenders for the top spot, for most everyone, native speakers or not: \u201cTests\u201d & \u201csixths.\u201d Each have a sibilant, \u2018s\u2019, on both sides of a stop consonant, \u2018t\u2019 or fricative \u2018th\u2019. I think most people consider \u2018sixths\u2019 to be worse, because you have the cluster of \u2018xths\u2019, with a hard \u2018k\u2019 sound, followed by a sharp \u2018s\u2019, followed by an unbreathed \u2018th\u2019, followed by a \u2018z\u2019. This makes your mouth do gymnastics trying to go from a stop, to a sibilant, to an unbreathed fricative, to a breathed sibilant. That said, while it may be difficult to say, I don\u2019t hear many native speakers trip over it too badly. They seem to just give each sound its time and move on, while this cluster of consonants is murder for foreign speakers not used to those sounds. On the other hand, I\u2019ve never heard anyone say the plural of \u2018test\u2019 without sounding awkward. Two hard \u2018esses\u2019, one on either side of a very hard stop. It\u2019s very difficult to say, and not sound weird, you want to insert a \u2018schwa\u2019 sound after the \u2018t\u2019, but you can\u2019t, because that gives you testes. (Even though \u2018testes\u2019 is usually pronounced \u2018test-eez\u2019, you\u2019ll still associate it.) This is why so many people will talk about their \u2018exams\u2019, if they have more than one test, or they will specify \u201cI did well on my math test and English test\u201d rather than \u201cI did well on my math and English tests.\u201d \u201cStrengths\u201d is another good contender. That said, it is always fun to ask people to try and say \u201crural lawyer\u201d three times fast. \u201cA rural lawyer in Worcestershire discussed the strengths of the sixth squirrel\u2019s tests.\u201d That\u2019s a mouthful. The thing is, each person is different, and so different people will find different things easier or harder to say. Editing note: I was called out in the comments for calling the \u2018th\u2019 cluster a stop, when it is a fricative, so that has been edited to reflect that. Some good additions were mentioned in the comments, too, \u201ctexts\u201d, and \u201cIsthmus\u201d, as well as anything with the \u2018sks\u2019 cluster, like desks and tasks. Thanks for keeping me on my toes, folks. ",
