            "answer_text": "First, it should be noted that copyright and trade marked are different things and the distinction can be important in cases like this. Technically speaking, anything that has been put into physical form, whether that be a recording, sheet music, or simply written lyrics, has been copy-written. This is important because if somebody copies it, you can say that have ownership and rights based on that alone...of course you'll have to prove that you created it first and not the other guy, which is where the old \"mail it to yourself and leave it in a sealed envelope so you can show the postmark date\" business comes from. You can trade mark basically anything by applying for it. This is the way that artist (and other people) convert one thing that they have said or made into an untouchable property. A quick web search will show you a great many statements that Taylor Swift (or her marketing team) has  gotten trademarks for.  If a song contains a phrase that is commonplace it is unlikely that any copyright  infringement could be argued unless you are obviously biting it from another song. Conversely, if you print something that has been trademarked by someone they will be able to take you to court pretty easily.  All that said... I find it a little ridiculous when an artist or company tries to say nobody can use the things they didn't even create. Monster, for example, supposedly went through a phase where they sued people for using the word monster in their ads or company names, but I don't know how that turned out for anyone involved... Also, it makes a big difference if you are making a profit from whatever you make with words they have rights to.  ",

            "answer_text": "Song lyrics, just like any other creative work, are protected by copyright in all countries that are signatories of the Berne Convention as soon as they are recorded, whether in audio or written form.  This allows the lyricist to control how his or her creative work is used and arrange to receive compensation for its use. However, the titles of songs are not copyrightable, nor are only a few words (such as \"See you again\").  How much of a song's lyrics you can use without infringing on the owner's copyright is determined by a judge, should the owner decide to sue you for copyright infringement. A word or phrase used as a brand for goods or services can be protected by trademark.  For example, someone might theoretically trademark the phrase \"See You Again\" as a clothing brand, and anyone else marketing clothing using that phrase may be guilty of trademark infringement.  This does not prevent anyone else from using the phrase \"See You Again\" in any other context: as a song, movie or book title; in song lyrics or movie dialog; or even as a company or product name for a completely different business.
