You cannot gain any knowledge or information from this question because people have different life experiences and what is dark to one individual is largely based upon what traumas or issues you have or have previously had. Initially, I took this question seriously and started to think about what songs always make me cry. I had to stop. The exercise brought me to dark places as that was the point, and just no. The Doors are the greatest band ever! Don't make it sad! \ud83d\ude0d\ud83e\udd29\u270c ",
