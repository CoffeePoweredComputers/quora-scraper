            "answer_text": "The same reason a lot of people dislike olives or romcoms. Preferences vary from person to person and music is a classic example for this. I am personally a hardcore fan of his music and his persona so it\u2019s kinda hard for me to understand why people might dislike him. To a lot of people, his voice or style of music may be very mainstream, which again causes them to dislike him. Another reason is that most people have listened to only those songs of his that reach the Billboard top 100, but there are a lot of songs by Charlie such as \u201cNothing But Trouble\u201d, \u201c LA Girls\u201d, \u201cI Won\u2019t Tell A Soul\u201d, \u201cLeft Right Left\u201d, \u201cLosing My Mind\u201d, etc that definitely deserve more attention than they have received.
