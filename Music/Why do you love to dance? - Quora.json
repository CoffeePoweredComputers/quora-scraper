            "answer_text": "I like to dance for many reasons, but these days, it's primarily because it is my primary and most effective spiritual technology. Dancing releases me from my head and gets me into my body. My experience of the world becomes one where I am no longer separate from anything or anyone around me. It's just a form of oneness. Dance is great for many other reasons, too. I like the exercise. I like the social experience. I like the creativity and expression.  I love that I can do things when I dance that I can't do otherwise. I mean, physically, I am incapable of many things normally, but when I dance, I turn into super-Steven. Just for example, I can leap a lot higher when I'm dancing than I can ordinarily, and I can sustain many leaps in a row that would totally tire me out if I weren't in that altered state of consciousness.  Dance has a lot to teach me about life, too. It teaches me how to respond to changing circumstances gracefully and creatively, without freaking out. It is the quintessential going with the flow. It teaches me confidence. It teaches me how to listen. As a musician, that is pretty important. In addition, it helps me understand other people. I have learned how to assess people very quickly by dancing with them. I learn things about their personalities that would take me years to figure out in a non-dance interaction. In the intimacy of dance, people show parts of themselves they would never otherwise show. Trust is often implicit. Or people can't help themselves. And I have learned to be very attentive to these signals that people normally won't share with others until they know you very well. There's a lot to like about dance. It is incredibly spiritual. It is perhaps the most efficient way of getting to know other people. It teaches you empathy and intuition. And it is exercise. Good for heart and soul and body and psychology. It is also, it seems, a way to keep your mind active as you age -- part of geriatric longevity and quality of life treatments. ",

            "answer_text": "Because it\u2019s fun, expressive, challenging, and it counts as exercise. Seriously. I love to dance because it helps me really be focused on the present, in the studio; I myself don\u2019t know how I do it but when I dance I forget all my worries, whether it\u2019s in friendship, school, or anything else. When I dance I work hard, and that makes me feel good. It\u2019s feels amazing to feel tired after dancing, knowing you\u2019re part of something so amazing. When I dance, I enjoy myself and try and get better every single time, losing myself in the music. Dancing is my comfort; I don\u2019t just dance in the studio; I dance at school, at home, in the classroom, even in the library; dance is so expressive and it requires no words; when I\u2019m at a loss of words I can dance and release all my energy. Dance is magical because of all the people you meet as well. Some of my \u2018dance friends\u2019 are considered to be my closest; it\u2019s because when you dance together you work together, and there\u2019s a connection that just happens. As they say, friends who dance together, stay together. Whoever says dance isn\u2019t a sport\u2014that\u2019s because it\u2019s more than that. Dance is an art and a language and so much more than I can tell; but it\u2019s also exercise, which is amazing\u2014I don\u2019t run, I don\u2019t throw, I don\u2019t play ball games; in other words, I am not sporty. If it weren\u2019t for dance, I\u2019d be even less fit that I am now. I don\u2019t just love to dance; dance is my language, my comfort; most importantly, it\u2019s my exercise. Too bad I\u2019m not that good at it. Ha. ",
