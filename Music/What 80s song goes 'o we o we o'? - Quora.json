The beginning of the song starts out with this chant that was borrowed from the \u201cWizard of Oz\u201d when the the guards were protecting the witches castle. They were chanting the same thing. Some say the guards were chanting,\u201dall we own, we owe\u201d personally I\u2019ve never heard it. Metallica uses this chant at the beginning of their song to reinforce the nature of the song with the themes of dementia, and schizophrenia. ",
