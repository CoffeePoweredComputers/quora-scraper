            "answer_text": "Hey there!  I think people (including vloggers) often think they're taking the easy way out by making cat videos, etc., when actually the competition for those is so enormous out there, it's impossible for them to gain a large audience and enough engagement. I say, figure out the type of humor you're best at, and then try out a few things - prank videos, reenacting famous movie scenes, parodies, asking people on the street random questions, etc. I've compiled some more ideas here, you're welcome to take a look. Good luck! :) ",

            "answer_text": "I think being funny is just something you either have or you don't. I was reading the newspaper last week about some colleges wanting to open more classes to \"study comedy\". What a joke. You can't \"study\" comedy. Some people are just wildly unfunny. Being funny has a lot to do with being intelligent. Why do you think they say \"humor is the highest form of intelligence?\"Being funny is largely something you're born with. That's why the gifted community tend to be hilarious people. They're smart AND funny. ",
