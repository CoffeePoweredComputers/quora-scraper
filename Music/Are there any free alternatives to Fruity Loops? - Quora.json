With that being said, the Anonymous answer is correct, LMMS is an open source version of FL Studio. It mirrors many of the workflows of FL, and features a similar UI to FL. Your best bet is to go for LMMS. ",

I suggest you Ableton Live 10 an easy, fast, and flexible software for music creation and performance and you can try it for 90 days The most important is that you develop a workflow for the creation of music no matter the DAW you choose ",
