            "answer_text": "Paul McCartney's opinion on Queen: Here's what Paul McCartney said about Freddie: \u201cFreddie always had a good voice. That's always been the anchor of that group I think and Brian good guitar player as well you know they've had musical skill. ... But I think there's a say, the first thing you heard with Queen was Freddie's voice.  JOHN: It appears John was never photographed with or met any of the members of Queen (which is a shame). I think at the time Queen were coming to the forefront of music, John had just moved to America and as Queen rose, John withdrew from the public eye to look after Sean. However, as you may know, John was a hero of Freddie\u2019s in particular. The above video is an audio recording of Queen playing Imagine live in concert at Wembley, London on the 9th December 1980, the day after John died, and the day the the news would have been spreading and shocking the world. Queen continued to play Imagine live as a tribute to John through out 1981\u201382 (maybe longer). Around the same time Freddie wrote the song Life is Real (Song For Lennon) which appeared on the Queen album Hot Space, released in 1982. Life is Real is almost a pastiche of a John Lennon song, starting with three bell-like piano notes, paying homage to Beautiful Boy and Starting Over, and its a \u2018sparse\u2019 piano based tune, also playing musical homage to Mother, and the title may be a reference to Strawberry Fields (Nothing is Real) or Love (Love is Real). Also on the same album is the song Put Out The Fire which seems to reference John\u2019s death in the lyrics: They called him a heroIn the land of the freeBut he wouldn\u2019t shake my hand boyHe disappointed meSo I got my hand gunAnd I blew him awayThat critter was a bad guyAnd I had to make him pay GEORGE:  Here\u2019s a photo of George (with Joe Brown and Chas McDevitt) playing a Brian May Red Special guitar in 1992 (I think it\u2019s probably Brian\u2019s actual, original guitar!) And here\u2019s George and Brian at the same event:  Brian May is a huge George fan. I think it\u2019s fair to say George is his favourite guitarist. (As an aside, people sometimes like to rip off George and belittle his guitar playing - I think, only because he wasn\u2019t a showboat-er or as ostentatious as other guitarists, people can overlook him - but George is a guitar player's guitarist. People who really know what they\u2019re talking about are typically fans of George). Brian only met George once, at the Water Rats Ball (a charity event) which was held on the 29th November 1992. Here\u2019s a quote from Brian from an interview in November 2001 (just before George died): \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about George a lot recently and I really wish him well. And just before you came I was thinking about how the press treated Freddie when he was ill. You know, he literally couldn\u2019t step outside his door for photographers. They were even trying to get in the windows and there\u2019s absolutely nothing you can do; you have no protection. \u201cBut I\u2019ve only met George once. We played together at a Water Rats do, when Bert Weedon was King Rat. There was George, Joe Brown, Bert and me\u2026 what a precious moment. I had a blinding migraine, but the moment overcame the pain. I wish I\u2019d had the balls to say what I really wanted to at the time. I hold George in such reverence and I think he\u2019s so underrated by the guitar community; everyone raves about people who play fast, but if you look at the catalogue of stuff he\u2019s produced, it\u2019s colossal.\u201d Here\u2019s some of my favourite Brian/George tweets from Dr May as well:    ",

            "answer_text": "Guys, Queen is really cool. I like Freddie Mercury a lot. But I saw them early on at Winterland in SF? They were just another opening band. Maybe got third billing. I thought they were really nothing special, just another kind of decent opening act, sort of a run of second or third acts that toured the country and landed at Winterland or the Fillmore. I defer to all the answers here that speak to the individual Beatles\u2019 thoughts. Did they make new music, meaning Queen? Yes, to a certain degree they latched onto light opera and anthems and used that sort of music to make a really cool thing. But they were never the Beatles. As many sell-outs as Queen had, the Beatles had to quit touring because it got too loud and too crazy. If Ringo sells out concerts\u2014sorry Ringo\u2014imagine what the Fab Four could have done for 50 years. The Beatles attacked Country/Western, Pop, Indian music, psychedelic music, rock and rock and roll. For all the good Queen songs, I can name you ten or more good Beatles songs. Sorry, don\u2019t want to be a jerk and say that I don\u2019t think Queen is on a par with the Beatles, but they just weren\u2019t, no matter how big they got. I understand why students and younger folks still like Queen and maybe are tired of hearing about the Beatles, but believe me, from \u201963 on the Beatles were something really very different and new\u2014I was there to see it. Listen to Beatles songs played with strings or by some innovative guitarist and you will know how they influenced what is out there now. You had Rock around the Clock stuff, r & b, country, and Motown before the Beatles. When they hit they led the way for everyone who came after including Queen. ",
