            "answer_text": "David Stuart nailed it about as well as anyone could. And he\u2019s right about it being fun. Here\u2019s a list of \u2018clues\u2019 to Paul\u2019s death- \"Paul Is Dead\": The Clues on Beatles Album Covers Here are the clues that Beatles fans \"found\" in the band's album covers to convince themselves that Paul McCartney died as early as 1966 and was replaced by a lookalike named Billy Shears. Since all accounts of the \"Paul is Dead\" story have Paul dying no earlier than fall of 1966, clues will be limited here to albums that came out after Paul's supposed demise -- although that inconsistency hasn't stopped fans from \"finding\" PID \"clues\" as far back as 1964's A Hard Day's Night album. Since it's possible for creative minds to read anything into anything, this list focuses on the main clues that are repeated most often by PID believers and non-believers. Clues which are based on clearly false information are listed in italics. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band Front cover The \"new\" Paul (called Faul by Paul is Dead believers) is shown with a hand over his head. Throughout the Beatles' later period, pictures and drawings of Paul surfaced featuring a hand over his head. This is an Eastern religion's way of symbolizing evil or death. (Not true.) None of the other Beatles have a hand over their heads in any officially released picture or drawing after the fall of 1966.Paul is the only Beatle holding a black musical instrument.A group of hyacinths forms a guitar, positioned as a left-handed musician would play it. Paul is the only left-handed Beatle. The guitar only has three strings, representing the three remaining Beatles. The flowers also spell \"Paul?\" (This arrangement was the brainstorm of the floral assistant, who decided on the spot to create a guitar from flowers.)Hold a mirror up to the exact middle of the bass drum that features the \"Sgt. Pepper\" logo, horizontally, and it spells out \"I ONE IX HE DIE.\" This refers to the date of Paul's death -- November 9th. (Some suggest that since the British system of dates puts the day and not the month first, this would make the date of Paul's death September 11th, which has morbid connotations already. It also fits in with the fact that the band was completely inactive from August 29, 1966 until September 14, 1966, a period of isolation unmatched in their history.)Back cover Paul's back is to the camera, while the rest of the Beatles are facing the camera. This is a reference to Paul's death. (Outtakes from the photo sessions show many different positions, most of which feature Paul facing the camera.)George \"points\" to the lyric \"Wednesday morning at five o' clock,\" the day and time of the crash. Read across that line from left to right and you receive several clues in a row: \"Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,\" \"Wednesday Morning at five o'clock as the day begins,\" \"Life flows on within you and without you,\" \"You're on your own, you're in the street.\"Inside gatefold \"Paul\" is wearing a patch which says \"OPD.\" This is Canadian for \"Officially Pronounced Dead.\"(All four Beatles had received this patch, which actually reads \"OPP\" and stands for \"Ontario Provincial Police.\")Magical Mystery TourFront cover Paul is dressed as a walrus. The walrus, in India, is a symbol of death. (Not true.) His arms are spread wide, as in a crucifixion.Turn the cover upside down and the word \"Beatles\" spells out \"537-1438,\" or \"231-7438,\" or, backwards, 834-7132. This is a phone number that, when dialed, leads to an answering machine message featuring more clues. (Try it yourself.)Original album booklet In the tracklisting, under \"I Am The Walrus,\" is written in longhand \"'No you're not!' said little Nicola.\" Little Nicola is a character in the accompanying MMT film, but she never says this to John. Paul is the Walrus in the film. The walrus, in India, is a symbol of death. (Not true.)On Page 2 Paul sits in front of a sign reading \"I You Was.\" No explanation is given.On Page 9 the word \"Hill\" runs down the side of the cartoon Paul's head, in red. This is a reference to his massive head injury suffered in the crash.On Page 13 Paul is pictured without shoes, a sign of death. (Not true.) The shoes are to his left, and, some say, covered in a blood-red substance.On Page 23, and in the \"Your Mother Should Know\" portion of the film, Paul is wearing a black carnation. The other Beatles are all wearing red ones.The Beatles (known as \"The White Album\")Poster There is a picture of \"Paul\" with a mustache and glasses which is actually William Campbell before his Paul makeover.There is a picture of Paul in the bathtub which parallels how his corpse looked after the crash.Yellow Submarine Front cover A hand is over Paul's head on the cover cartoon. This is an Eastern religion's way of symbolizing evil or death. (Not true.)Abbey RoadFront cover Paul is barefoot, which is how corpses are buried. John, in white, represents the preacher, George, in denim, represents the gravedigger, Ringo, all in black, represents the pallbearer. (No pun intended.)Paul's eyes are closed, he's walking out of step with the others, and smoking a cigarette in the \"wrong\" hand (Paul being a leftie).The license plate on the Volkswagon reads \"LMW 28IF.\" Paul would have been 28 IF he was still alive. (Paul was 27.)Back cover The dots to the left of the \"B\" in \"Beatles\" can be connected to form a \"3,\" indicating that there are now only three Beatles.There's a crack running through the word \"Beatles,\" and a skull barely visible to the right of the sign.Let It BeFront cover The other Beatles are pictured on a white background; Paul's background is blood-red. Supposedly, there are few visual clues on this album since it was released after the PID furor died down.The following is a list of clues in songs. It\u2019s important to note that Paul\u2019s supposed replacement was one William Campbell-Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club BandThis song details the arrival of William Campbell; the Beatles are pretending to be another band in order to reveal the hoax.With A Little Help From My FriendsThe introduction announces \"Billy Shears,\" a pun on words which means \"Billy's here,\" referring to the arrival of William Campbell.She's Leaving HomeThe opening line \"Wednesday morning at five o'clock\" indicates the time of Paul's crash.Lovely RitaDetails Paul catching a glimpse of Rita the meter maid, which led to the crash.Good Morning, Good MorningThe phrases \"nothing to do to save his life,\" \"and you're on your own you're in the street,\" \"people running around it's 5 o'clock,\" and \"watching the skirts you start to flirt, now you're in gear\" are all details of the crash. Notice the time of the crash matches that in \"She's Leaving Home.\"A Day In The LifeThe person John wrote about in these famous lines is reported to be Tara Browne, heir to the Guinness fortune. But PIDers see these lyrics as a motherlode of crash details, including \"He blew his mind out in a car. He didn't notice that the lights had changed. A crowd of people stood and stared. They'd seen his face before...\"Magical Mystery TourFool On The HillThe fool is apparently Campbell, who is doomed to be ignored for \"the sound he appears to make.\" Or the fool is Paul, who is dead and buried, which is why he lies \"perfectly still.\"I Am The WalrusThis song features a sampled recording of a BBC production of Shakespeare's King Lear. The sampled passage goes like this: Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my bodyAnd give the letters which you find'st about meTo Edmund, Earl of Gloucester. Seek him outUpon the English party. O, untimely death!Death! I know thee well: a serviceable villain,As duteous to the vices of thy mistressAs badness would desire. What, is he dead? Sit you down, father. Rest you. The chanting at the end, when played backwards, reveals the chanted phrase \"Paul is dead! Ha ha!\"Strawberry Fields ForeverAt the end of the track, when it fades back in, John is heard saying \"I buried Paul.\" (John actually says \"cranberry sauce,\" as proven on the Anthology outtakes.Hello Goodbye\"You say goodbye, I say hello\" is William Campbell's mention of his arrival and Paul's departure.All You Need Is LoveAt the end of the track, John sings, \"Yes he's dead,\" and \"We loved you, yeah, yeah, yeah...\"(Examination of the audio proves that John is singing \"Yesterday\" and that Paul joins him in singing \"She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah / She'd love to, yeah, yeah, yeah...\") The Beatles (known as \"The White Album\")Glass Onion\"Here's another clue for you all, the Walrus was Paul.\" The Walrus, in India, is a symbol of death.(Not true.) A \"glass onion\" is an English term for a see-thru coffin. (Also not true.)While My Guitar Gently WeepsGeorge is singing \"Paul, Paul, Paul\" at the end of the song. (Actually, he's just moaning.)I'm So TiredThe gibberish at the end, when played backwards, becomes \"Paul is dead, man, miss him, miss him.\"Don't Pass Me ByRingo sings \"You were in a car crash / And you lost your hair.\" This is what happened to Paul.Revolution #9The repeated phrase \"Number nine,\" when played backwards, becomes \"turn me on, dead man.\" There's also a lot of recorded conversation in this music-free track, much of which has been taken by listeners as clues to Paul's crash and death: \"his voice was low and his eyes were high and his eyes were closed\" and \"his legs were drawn, his hands were tied, his feet were bent and his head was on fire and his glasses were insane. This was the end of his audience,\" and \"My wings are broken and so is my hair. I'm not in the mood for wearing clothing.\" You can also hear the crash, a fire, sirens, and Paul screaming \"Get me out.\" Yellow SubmarineOnly A Northern SongWritten by George in reference to the band's publishing company, Northern Songs, this song contains several lyrics that reference Paul's replacement, such as \"When you're listening late at night / You may think the band is not quite right,\" and \"You may think the band's a little dark and out of key,\" before announcing \"There's nobody there.\"Hey BulldogAlthough this is John's song, both John and Paul sing lead vocals, which makes the line \"You think you know me, but you haven't got a clue\" suspect to PID enthusiasts. Abbey RoadCome Together\"One and one and one is three\" refers to the three remaining Beatles. Let It Be Let It BeThe phrase \"Let It Be,\" played backwards, becomes \"He is dead.\" Singles Lady MadonnaThe line \"Wednesday morning papers didn't come\" refers to <i>an English newspaper recalling Wednesday's paper which reported Paul's crash</i> (which happened, according to the legend, on a Tuesday). (There's no evidence of any papers being recalled on the day in question.)RevolutionJohn sings \"Paul died, Paul died\" at the end. (He's actually singing \"All right,\" a continuation of the phrase used in the chorus.)You Know My Name (Look Up The Number)After the cuckoo clock chimes, a phone rings, and a number is recited. Calling this number will present you with a recorded announcement containing more clues. Let me thank the About Entertainment website.",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not true at all. The theory gained some credence in the mid sixties and was fueled by the Beatles disappearance from public life. In 1963/64/65 and most of 66, the Beatles were everywhere. They toured constantly, played for huge numbers of fans, appeared on TV programs and radio shows and made public appearances all the time. They were incredibly busy and had a large public profile. And then in 1966 the Beatles retreated from public life. They stopped touring, stopped giving TV and radio appearances and effectively disappeared as far as the public was concerned. Apart from occasional glimpses, the only indication that they existed was the stream of albums and singles than came out of Abbey Road. The truth is that the band were worn out and wanted to dedicate time to making records and taking some time to themselves. But some members of the public were looking for anther explanation. They believed the only thing that could explain the sudden change in attitude was the death of Paul. Clearly they had stopped doing concerts because Paul was dead and his voice was being impersonated on albums. John was continuing the Beatles without him and pretending that Paul was right there alongside him. The idea was given further fuel when Paul started a relationship with Linda Eastman. He had been involved in a high profile romance with Jane Asher for five years and before many knew that their relationship had broken up, he was announcing he was with another girl. The only explanation was that the real Paul had died and the replacement was in love with Linda. Whether or not people actually believed the theory, it became a lot of fun to spot \u201cclues\u201d in lyrics and images. Paul is standing with his back to the camera in the Sgt Peppers artwork. Paul is barefoot on the Abbey road cover which looks like a funeral procession etc etc. The clues were everywhere if you looked for them. The theory had some life when the Beatles were away from the public eye but once they broke up, Paul eventually returned to touring and public life. He started performing live shows and making TV and radio appearances and generally returning to stardom. If Paul did die in 1966, as the theory claims, then the three Beatles, their large staff, the staff at EMI, Paul\u2019s family, Jane Asher and dozens, possibly hundreds, of others needed to be in on the conspiracy and have managed to maintain the fiction for five decades. And the guy they found to replace him looks exactly like Paul, sings exactly like Paul, talks exactly like Paul, plays instruments exactly like Paul, writes songs exactly like Paul and has all the same mannerisms. I\u2019m 100% confident that the Paul McCartney who played at the London Olympics is the same one who played in the Cavern Club in the early sixties. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not fun to look for clues. ",
