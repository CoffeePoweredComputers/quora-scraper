            "answer_text": "Absolutely. I don't buy CDs anymore, as my entire library is digital, but I buy my music, usually from Amazon, but also from iTunes. Buying music is the only way to make sure artists you enjoy get to keep making music for you. People get so hung up on the handful of mega-selling artists and think that justifies stealing music. For every Katy Perry there are a thousand bands killing themselves every night to make enough to eat and buy drum heads and guitar strings. Don't fuck them over after they've given you music you love. They deserve to be paid for it. UPDATE: Maybe a year and a half ago, I switched over to an Amazon Music subscription. It\u2019s glorious and I love it. Any song or album I can imagine at my fingertips anywhere. What a time to be alive! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, for many reasons When the sound quality matters, there's a clear difference between streaming services and listening to a record with a good quality sound systemThe dynamic range is more limited in streaming services/online purchases because they are compressed. In addition to the worse sound quality that really matters especially in classical music where it's important to hear some very quiet delicate parts in contrast to loudness of the full orchestra.I think it's worth it to support the musicians whose music I like to listen to.Some people really appreciate cover art in the albums and like to have the concrete item to look at. LP records have made a comeback, at least among the hipsters.I pay for Spotify Premium, it's handy and it's not realistic that I would have everything I occasionally listen to at my shelf. But if I really like something, I'll buy the record.",
