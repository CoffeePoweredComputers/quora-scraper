            "answer_text": "That's better phrased as \u201cacademic use\u201d, associated with a class or research project at an accedited learning institution. That helps you understand the difference between the allowed uses compared to, say, a BBC animal documentary which is also \u201ceducational purpose, but not fair use. Use of a section of music as part of an assignment or research project is allowed. Other use, especially distribution to others, is copyright infringement. Consider: text books have to pay for the photos they use, pay their writers, buy the maps and graphics they use. They can't make a fair use claim, because their purpose is \u201ceducational\u201d, but also to sell books commercially. ",
