            "answer_text": "There are many places to buy LOONA albums. You can buy them from your local kpop album store, target, or amazon. Try to buy one that is unopened and not previously owned from preferably target (in-store, not online) because the shipment fee might be expensive and the actual solo and duo albums are normally not that expensive, especially when but in-store in TARGET. Local kpop album stores may bump up the price on the solo and subunit albums ESPECIALLY. If you\u2019re looking for full group albums they will most likely be available in Target. If you can\u2019t buy them in store shop online at target or amazon from the official LOONA store (it\u2019ll mention the account somewhere). Do NOT buy from anywhere that\u2019s NOT those 3 places, you may get scammed and the money and sales won\u2019t go to LOONA and their company. There are also other trusted kpop album websites like Choice Music LA, and more, but PLEASE do your research before purchasing or else you may get scammed. ",

Even without an account, you can search \u201cselling loona albums,\u201d and someone may be selling their extras. They should give you the photocard(s) as well. Obviously, someone with Loona as their primary group will probably have more albums to sell off. Be careful though, you have to verify that you can trust them first. ",
