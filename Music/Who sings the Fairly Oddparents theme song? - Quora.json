            "answer_text": "The theme song is used to give the basic premise of the show, about Timmy's miserable life, his inattentive parents, his mean babysitter Vicky, and his magical fairy godparents, Cosmo and Wanda. At the end of the intro, Vicky's head changes into a different item usually relating to the episode. It was written by Ron Jones and show creator Butch Hartman.
