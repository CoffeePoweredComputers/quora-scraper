            "answer_text": "The best way to make friends is to join a hobby group or some sort of group where you have things in common with people. This serves two purposes. It makes it so you can have a reason to be around them more than once, on a regular basis. So theres not so much pressure. Then you have the benefit of having something in common with the person to talk about. Maybe a shared interest, or if its a class youre taking you can talk about what youre studying. When were kids it was easier to make friends because all the hard work is already done for us. Were stuck in school with a bunch of people in a similar sittuation to us, similar age, having a very similar experience. So you have all that in common and its easier to build on that and make friends. As you get older, and out into the adult world, you may end up working a job with people you really have nothing in common with. Then you dont have as much time, maybe you are tired all the time and dont have the energy to go out like you need to. So you become sort of isolated. Whatever the sittuation though. The best way to make friends is find a reason to be around people regularly. Its more about time spent with them than anything. Once you spend id say maybe a a good bit of time (20 hours or so?) around somebody theyre going to be comfortable with you and you with them. So its mainly trying to figure out ways to make that happen. Thats why i suggested groups. meetup dot com is a good place to start, the library, take a course in school, volunteer, go walk regularly in your neighborhood. You might see your neighbors outside during the summer and you can speak in passing. Dont over do it. Just say hello and whatever you feel comfortable with and go from there. The main thing and i cant stress this enough is GET OUT OF YOUR HOUSE. You will not make any friends sitting in your house. People dont just show up on your doorstep. Its a lot of work. Youll run into more incompatible people than you will people you click with. Dont let that discourage you. Because you only need that one success to find a friend. Think of it like interviewing people for a job. Not every applicant is going to be right to be up in your business lol. But some will be. They may not be perfect, they will have flaws just like you. But if you can look past that, accept them for who they are. Be yourself and have fun, and help them have fun too. Then youll make a friend. Another little bit of advice too is dont put pressure on yourself to make friends. Just go do things for the purpose fo doing them and have fun. If you run into people there you click wtih great. If not then you still have that experience. Keep trying, keep going, keep doing and dont stop until you find some kewl people you enjoy spending time with. Im a professional hermit. And i approved this message. Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm personally very introverted- I like my time to myself, I enjoy sitting around doing \"nothing\" a lot, and leaving the apartment for non-work-related things more than a couple times per week is almost a chore. It's not that I don't enjoy friends, socialization, or partaking in activities outside of my home, it's just that I feel inundated with things to do very quickly and eventually it hits a point that the perceived cost is greater than the perceived reward. I'm not sure if that's how you experience it or not, but I know what's kept me happy in my situation (don't get me wrong, I am, and have always been, an extremely happy person): 1. Find really good friends. Like, the best kind of friends. You don't need a lot, just a few, and it doesn't have to be an overnight thing because strong friendships take time to form. The bottom line is that the closer you are with your friend(s), the less it feels like a \"chore\" and the more it feels like a fun activity. This is basically how my relationship with my wife is. We're almost always together with the exception of work, yet I don't feel like it's a social obligation so much as I feel like she's another part of me. My good friends are the same way- I could spend days in their company and not be fed up with it. Also, if a lot of them are introverted too, it's easy to just kind of hang out and do low-key things like video games and movies at home etc. without making it feel like you're doing too much, especially if you live close to each other. 2. It's good to have at least one mild to extreme extrovert in your group of friends. This is the person who will be engaging and suggest different fun activities. I know a couple extroverts who will spend time just thinking of or looking up fun things to do and, as long as you enjoy their company and as long as they understand you won't want to go every single time, the relationship works out great. They feel like they're helping you get out more and you're having fun doing things that probably require more planning and effort than you'd want to put in yourself. Just make sure they have other extroverted friends because you can't and shouldn't expect to fill all their socialization needs. 3. Okay, so what if you can't find a lot of friends to fit those descriptions? In that case, I recommend doing what I started a long time ago: Just do whatever makes you happy and don't worry about what the general consensus says. Understand that some people will disagree with you and be okay with it, because it's not their happiness at stake, it's yours. Now, don't confuse this with \"close yourself off to the world and never return\" because leaving yourself options means you might discover something that makes you happy that you could have otherwise missed. I'm just saying to be comfortable with being introverted because it's not wrong. How does this help make your social life more interesting? Well, in my case, pressure to socialize and participate in events makes me feel less inclined to do so- I like to make sure I have enough time to myself. Knowing that I'm happy doing my own thing regardless of how other people perceive it takes a lot of pressure off of me and makes social events more enjoyable because I'm electing to go, not being pressured into going. I'm not doing my extroverted friend a favor so much as I'm deciding that it sounds like a fun idea. On a related note, if your friend(s) honestly give you too much crap and/or can't support your own decision making process/introversion, then I'm not sure they fall into my category from #1. Not to say you should never talk to them again or anything, but generally that sort of relationship doesn't make anyone happier if nobody's willing to give. Good friends will understand that your occasional (or frequent) decision to stay home is not in any way intended to offend them and it has nothing to do with the friend- it's just how you operate. 4. Last point is to find overlaps between the things you really love and socialization opportunities. You love reading? Join a book club. You love walking or nature? Join a hiking group. You love beer, wine, or breweries? Get some friends to go on brewery tours or wine tastings. You into sports? Join a sports league at your skill level or even just kick/throw a ball around with a couple friends. You get the idea. The more you do it, the more new things you might find that overlap with your interests and the more likely you'll be to want to do these activities with your friends. (Obviously some shared interests are recommended) Especially when you feel personally involved in coming up with ideas, it won't feel like you're doing a duty anymore- this was your plan. Taking my last example: if you're kicking the ball around and think \"Hey, joining a soccer league would be fun!\" then suddenly you're on the other side of the coin and it becomes fun for you because you're interested. Anyway, these are just some tips from my personal life. You know your life a lot better than I do so ultimately you'll have to figure out what works best but hopefully my experience can help you find your way there. ",

Then there's likely to be a pretty stark maturity difference, given the gap in life experience. I've found that it's not exactly easy to maintain friendships with people you can't relate to in terms of intellect and experience. But none of that is to say that we could never be friends. Just that I don't think it'd work out right now. People change and grow throughout their lives. I'm sure that if you keep an open mind, and focus on growing yourself, you'll have plenty of good friendships in your life. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm in Year 11. I was very lonely during Year 8 as well. To conquer this situation, firstly, I started to think of the \u2018friendless' quality as special, as I don't think like other teenagers and I'm way ahead of them. Secondly, I started mingling with juniors and adults. If you really want to find good friends, then I suggest you attend constructive programs. They could be local, national, international. They could be summer camp, pre-college program, workshop. They could be writing, art or anything. The reason I'm telling you to this is because you're likely to meet some like-minded people there. The harder it is to get into these programs, the better. I liked innovation, so when I entered a platform that was for high school innovators, I got to communicate with some people who were just like me. Even though I had met this girl online, we planned a get-together in person and now we're good friends! She's better to communicate with than all the other girls around me, who are obsessed with social media, concerts, fangirling over celebrities. So if you want to find good friends, you should look towards those kinds of communities that suit you the best. The more you have in common with these people, the better friends you'll be. Best of luck. ",

            "answer_text": "My advice is the same as the advice I would give to someone asking, \u201cHow do I find a romantic relationship?\u201d Find something you like doing, that involves other people, and then do it. Do a lot of it. Enjoy doing it. Be full of joy in the doing of it. Joyful people are attractive to others. Joyful people are fun to be around. And you\u2019ll already have a ready-made topic of conversation, and at least one interest in common, with the people who are attracted by your joy! And, perhaps most importantly \u2014 the activities that you will be sharing with them create opportunities to interact. The hardest thing about making friends is encountering people in situations that don\u2019t actively block friendship. Work, shopping, eating out \u2014 these are all situations where there are structural barriers against friendship (same lines as the classic, \u201cDon\u2019t ask the waitress for her phone number\u201d). But a semi-social, shared activity? Perfect opportunity to get to know people. Oh\u2026and if you don\u2019t have any interests that involve other people? First, overcome not having interests that involve other people, by trying out lots of different things. Go hiking. Join a book club. Start attending special-interest groups in your area. Attend a political protest for some cause you believe in. Keep trying new things until you find ones that you enjoy purely for their own sake\u2014and then spend lots of time doing those, and you will unavoidably find yourself getting to know people who also enjoy doing them. At least some of them will also enjoy doing them with you. ",

Ask open ended questions. Speak with a lighthearted manner. Dont be too serious. Dont show it if you are offended about something. Give people a chance to show what they mean. Sometimes we may take things the wrong way and answer gruffly, so it turns people off. Also, you make the effort to contact people too. Invite someone out for coffee maybe at a bookstore, so you have lots of books and items around to pass the time Probably when you go there, you can pick up a couple magazines to brouse through while having light conversation. Follow up. If someone talked to you and gave their number , give them a call, dont wait for them to call. However, keep the call brief , maybe to about 3 to 5 minutes until you become more familiar with them.If someone refuses to answer your text, then keep finding new people. Dont put all your time into one person at a time. Always have new people to talk to. ",

Try making friends online and then meet up in real life. Join chat rooms, online communities which are for people with similar interests. Thats how I found new friends. Second.

From the second type, you will be progressed in your own behavior. Always choose a friend who has connected emotionally, but not physically. Who comes to you by your behavior, but not by your money/status. More importantly, to maintain long lasting friendship, you should give respect to others, but same time you should maintain your own attitude. Avoid a person who doesn't have own attitude/ own opinion and always changes decision without any logic. Don't try to pour/insist your thoughts on the other person or don\u2019t surrender completely to other person. Till you find right person, make any good habit as best friend. Sometimes, it is your hobby which gives you more friends. I suggest Instead of trying to search for the right person,try to be a special person with your own attitude. If you are one for a group, people will come automatically. Attitude makes difference. All the best. ",

Introverts are simply more private people, they value solitude (as least some of the time), they are thinkers and dreamers and imaginarians. (I like that word!) Boredom is simply a state and one that may affect anyone. Extroverts may seek relief in the form of interaction with others, perhaps even large groups. Introverts, on the other hand, may read, write, listen to music, watch a film or take a long walk somewhere peaceful.  Each person is unique, as are their interests, which are not necessarily tied to intro/extro-version.  While it's understandable that an extrovert might view the lifestyle or habits of the average introvert with wonder (including being puzzled how they might NOT be bored all the time), it's not complicated if you think about it. My son is an extreme extrovert. He can't stand to be alone and without external motivators, he goes stir-crazy. I'm quite the opposite and will pass on get-togethers or outings at the drop of a hat, in favor of peace and quiet at home.  I rarely get bored though. Find what interests you and then pursue those interests. It's as simple as that. ",

Make one new friend, take the initiative to talk to that person at first, do this with couple of more friends and the shyness will go. I am sure you are active in social networking platforms and you have many friends there. If not you can think of that option too. Send the friendship request, if accepted request for a face-to-face meeting. Since you are a guy, never expect to try this face-to-face meeting with a new girl whom you met online. When meeting online at first, nobody is sure about the identity, how attractive the profile or pictures may be, so everybody will be very cautious about the first meeting. Another thing that you can try is tell your friends that you want to make friendship with few of their friends. I hope they will agree and then you need to take the initiative for the first conversation. Your cousins may also help in this regard. But whoever helps you, you need to take the initiative to talk to the other person to overcome the shyness. ",

From there, immerse yourself in groups, clubs and activities etc that focus around your acquired interests. Try being yourself. Try not to modify your own behaviour to fit a proverbial mold. Smile. Be open (as cautiously as you feel comfortable with) with others and try to establish common ground. You'll realise that many people aren't quite on your wavelength but it's a genuine case of trial and error. You start with no friends today and make no friends by the end of it - so what - you try again tomorrow. Positivity attracts other positive people. Good luck friend. ",

Friendship is very often very hard to find, much harder to earn, very difficult to keep without due effort from both, all parties concerned. Seems like you might be very lonely and in need of someone to care about you. May I suggest that you begin looking for someone who may need somekind of caring, love, or friendship. Maybe then you won't need to ask this question and start living your own worthwhile life. Just turn the question around and you'll find the answer. Best wishes. Uncle Denis ",
