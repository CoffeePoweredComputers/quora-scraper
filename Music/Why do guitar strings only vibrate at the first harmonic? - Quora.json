            "answer_text": "They don\u2019t. They vibrate at all of the harmonics, but the fundamental frequency and first overtone are an octave apart\u2014in other words, it\u2019s the same note\u2014and every overtone above those first two harmonics is at a simple ratio that doesn\u2019t clash with the original \u201croot\u201d note. This makes it sound like just one note, even though it most certainly isn\u2019t. One way to show this is to play a string and then lightly touch that string right above the 12th fret. You\u2019ll hear a distinct change in sound, as though the string is vibrating an octave above where it was before, but you\u2019ll also notice an odd lack of change\u2014the \u201cnew\u201d note was always there. You could always hear it, and by touching the string at the 12th fret you\u2019ve just muted all of the harmonics below that one, letting it shine through loud enough to hear clearly. This can also be done, with a tad more difficulty, at the 7th and 5th frets, producing different, higher harmonics. In theory, you can play such \u201charmonics\u201d anywhere on the string, though they would often be too quiet to hear or even survive you touching the string. Enter distortion\u2014the overtones are equalized closer to the amplitude of your fundamental frequency, so in the infamous \u201cpinch harmonic\u201d you\u2019re just playing one of those hard-to-hear, upper register harmonics, and the distortion is amplifying it to audibility. This is also why Punk can get away with just using power chords\u2014just the \u201croot\u201d note and the \u201cfifth\u201d, as opposed to the root, fifth, and third. The overtones for those notes line up nicely with the other notes that you would have had in a full chord, making it sound full even though it\u2019s not. Interestingly, passing that full chord through distortion will give you some overtones that don\u2019t fit the chord, adding some muddiness and discord that power chords eliminate. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the question might be \u201cwhy do guitar string vibrations miss the fundamentals\u201d? Per Wikipedia - Missing Fundamental. \u201cThe fundamental frequency is not normally heard on acoustic guitars, classical guitars and other stringed instruments with one end of the strings anchored on a soundboard bridge which has a low profile, holding the strings close to the soundboard surface. In these cases, the lateral string vibration has no discernible effect on the bridge; instead, the bridge is excited by changes in string tension, which are twice the lateral wave frequency. On these instruments, listeners hear the first harmonic as the lowest note. Electric guitars are not like this; the fundamental frequency of each string is heard because the lateral string movement excites the electric pickups underneath the vibrating string.\u201d ",
