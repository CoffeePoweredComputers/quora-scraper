            "answer_text": "Yes and no. And yes. Let them explain: fun was founded by the 3 of us at a time when we were coming out of our own bands. one thing that has always been so special about fun is that we exist as 3 individuals in music who come together to do something collaborative. we make fun records when we are super inspired to do so. currently nate is working on his first solo album, andrew is scoring films and jack is on tour and working on bleachers music. Some Nights Intro we make records and tour when we are inspired to do so. that is the very reason why we have built such a special connection with all of you. that is how we can be the most honest to the people who support our music.  That voice. I look forward to another song as vivid as Tonight. This is the \u2018unplugged\u2019 version:  Ref: ournameisfun.com ",
