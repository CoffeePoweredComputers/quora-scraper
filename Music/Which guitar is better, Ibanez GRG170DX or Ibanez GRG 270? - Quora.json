            "answer_text": "Assuming you are referring to GRG270DX when you mentioned GRG270, I would say it is definitely better, as it is lighter and has a more consistent tone as compared to GRG170DX. This is because the body of 270DX is made of basswood while that of the 2017 version of 170DX is made of mahogany. The tricky thing with mahogany is that if it isn\u2019t crafted properly, you will be stuck with a very bright tone and sharp mid ranges which is undesirable. That\u2019s a risk you may or may not be willing to take. Also, 270DX holds the tuning much longer than the 170DX as it is equipped with a double locking tremolo system with lock nuts on the small bridge. Although it does make it quite a hassle to tune if you were looking to tune it to Drop D or Drop G (for slide licks), fine tuning could be done with the Edge III floating bridge while having the lock nuts fastened which is something you wont find in 170DX. Other than the body wood and the bridges, the rest are exactly the same for both including the shark-tooth inlays (that\u2019s what DX signifies). Even the pickups are the same Infinity R for humbuckers and Infinity RS for the single coils. I have played both of them and couldn\u2019t mark much of a difference between them, other that the things I\u2019ve mentioned above. They are both great beginner guitars. Good luck! ",
