            "answer_text": "Lets face it, building a fan base when nobody knows who you are can be challenging. It doesn't have to be that way. We live in the best time frame, with technology advancing faster than ever. But how does one get fans in today's world. It all starts with you FIRST. Once you have the proper mindset, you can achieve things you thought were unreachable. Ignore those who tell you to give up. You love doing this, and music is your life. The next important step is having a mailing list. Many music artist lack of building an email list. This is the biggest mistake you can make! This is how you will make money online and without it, you will struggle. I made this mistake when I first started out! I had gotten over a million views on my music and I didn't collect one email address from anyone. And guess what, I didn't make a dime! Some days, I wish I could go back in time and fix that error. I don't want you to make that same mistake! I wasted too much time in the past and would have gotten to where I wanted to be faster had I collected my fan's email address. That was another mistake I made, and that was getting plays. Getting plays or views don't mean nothing if you are not making any money off of it. Focus on building relationships with your fans and watch your music sell!Talk to your fans like they are your best friend. Tell them things about you. Why do you love rapping? What inspires you the most? How do you come up with songs? Where do you want to be in the next 5-10 years? How have your grown as a music artist? Once you start connecting with your fans and stay consistent with them, you will see results.  ",

            "answer_text": "The best way to gain fans from your music is to get out play live. You create a fan base by the live performances more than releasing a recording and hoping people might like it. When you go out and perform, people get exposed to everything, not just one song. They exposed to the manner and attitude, the charisma (or lack thereof) of the lead singer(s), and other musicians in the band. Sometimes the tried and true methods of building a fan base are best. And playing live dates is the best way to breed fans. They\u2019ll go home and talk about the amazing band they discovered that night. And they\u2019ll look for your next appearance, and drag their friends to see your band play. You see, it is the creation of the \u201csuper fan\u201d that you want to have. These super fans are some of the best unpaid advertisement you can get. They are true followers and will make people listen to your music, if you have recordings, and then make them come with them to the shows. It starts locally, and then moves to regional\u2026 and then it\u2019s up to you to keep the momentum going and creating fans along the way. The more super fans you have the more your music will be supported to people on the fence, getting them to come to a show and see for themselves! Get out and play your music in front of a crowd. THAT is how it\u2019s done. ",
