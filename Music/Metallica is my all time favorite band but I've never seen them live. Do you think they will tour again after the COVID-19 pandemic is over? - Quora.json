That to me is the closest to feeling - like you were at a real Metallica show because of the bootleg quality interspersed with pro shot footage without crazy, fancy cuts. All of their other live concert videos are great but there\u2019s a magic about Cliff Em All that would make not seeing them live ok. I hope they do play out again though for your and everyone\u2019s sake. Be safe & cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. Metallica have always been road dogs. That\u2019s part of the reason they became so huge in their early days. They tour constantly. That mentality has stayed with them, even after the made it big. It\u2019s also how they make their money. They earn, on average, $4 million per show. That\u2019s significantly more that they\u2019d earn from releasing a new album. They love playing for their fans. They\u2019ll hit the road again as soon as they\u2019re able.
