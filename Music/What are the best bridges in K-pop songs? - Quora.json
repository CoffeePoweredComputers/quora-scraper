            "answer_text": "One of the best questions ever!!! Seriously this answer will be filled with exo and am artists in general SOOO bear with me. Exo cbx- blooming days: hands down one of the best bridges, the way everything goes quiet and the bass kinda controls their dance, just to sum it up with chen's sustained high note. Exo- tempo: I don't even have to talk about this one, it's an acapella no one has ever seen this before, the way they trusted their vocals and harmonies while recording and even performing live is incredible Nct 127- superhuman: to begin with this song is a masterpiece, so it's ou normal for the bridge to be exceptional there were so much nice vocals in it and the production of the song was phenomenal Redvelvet- zimzalabim: this song is a rollercoaster of emotion and they had to blow our minds with the classical redvelvet bridge with the joy then seulgi then wendy trio singing in order to finish with wendy's high note and the cute little dance break Redvelvet- in and out: im sure that everyone loves this song, it's incredible and the bridge has also the same structure of almost all redvelvet songs yet I really can't get over it. Bts- I need you: one of my favorite bts songs ever, and the build up tension in the bridge with jungkook singing low and jimin high is a reason why this song is dear to me. Exo-power: the synths are just incredible and the instrumental is so clean with chen's soft vocals during that part, it's the perfect match, yet the reason why I love this bridge is not all that, it is Kai's little solo dance along with his very much incredible ballet spins Snsd- mr. mr: one of my favorite sm songs ever, snsd are vocal legends and they surely made it clear during the bridge of this song, it started with the synths and the complex instrumental then to the note changes and the harmonies and finally jessica's high note and taeyeon' one after her Loona- so what and hi High Dreamcatcher- red sun, boca, scream, deja vu, curse of the spider and silent night Baekhyun- candy oof Blackpink- whistle superM- jopping Nct- limitless And that was it, ofc there are a lot more than those but that's all I could think of atm. Edit: also all of loona odd eye circle songs, like lunatic, girl front etc\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "A lot of these are going to be SM because SM knows how to make a good bridge. I could put every Nct title track in here lmao. Not in any order. TEMPO BY EXOThis is probably the best bridge in my opinion. The build up at the end. It went from upbeat music too acapella. Go listen to it. The vocals were so beautiful.2. God\u2019s Menu by Stray Kids Felix\u2019s deep voice is normally the bridge or killing part of the song.3. ON by BTS Jungkook\u2019s vocals were so good and it really built up the final chorus.4. Love Shot by EXO D.O\u2019s \u201cpeople come and people go\u201d is so satisfying. Suho\u2019s vocals just added to it.5. Spring Day by BTS Pretty iconic. Tae\u2019s \u201cyour my best friend\u201d is so soothing and then JK\u2019s sweet vocals6. Happiness by Red Velvet I get chills when I listen to Wendy. Her \u201cshine on me\u201d is so iconic.7. Boss by Nct U I\u2019m pretty sure the bridge is Mark and Taeyong\u2019s rap. It\u2019s the highlight of the song.8. Simon Says by Nct 127 Haechan\u2019s vocals was my favorite part of the bridge and then Taeil\u2019s high note went crazy.9. So What by LOONA I love how the chorus ended on a high not but then it got all quiet.10. Stay Here by GAHO It\u2019s so relaxing. Please go listen to it. His high note right after was amazing.11. Tiger Inside by SuperM When Taemin said cage I literally got chills. Baekhyun\u2019s high notes are iconic.12. Ridin\u2019 by Nct Dream Chenle and Renjun\u2019s vocals were so sweet at the beginning. And then Jeno\u2019s rap\ud83d\ude33. Haechan\u2019s high note tied it all together.13. Boom by Nct Dream The rap with vocals in the back was amazing.14. Best of Me by BTS There was actually 2 bridges in this song. Jimin and JK\u2019s vocals and then J-hope\u2019s rap.15. Monster by EXO Baekhyun\u2019s sensual (idk) vocals and then Chen\u2019s high note.16. Black or White by DREAMCATCHER The vocals were so like soft but empowering.17. I AM YOU by Stray Kids Han\u2019s rap pulled the song together and just made it complete.18. Chain by Nct 127 I liked how the bridge calmed down a bit but the hype was still there. One of my favorite Taeil high notes.19. HIT by Seventeen This hyped me up so much!!20. Blood Sweat & Tears by BTS The bridge was kind of sexy in a way lmao.21. Candy by Baekhyun Baekhyun\u2019s \u201cna na na\u201d\u2019s gave me life.22. Voices by Stray Kids Their vocals were so soothing and then the rap popped off.23. INCEPTION by ATEEZ I love how upbeat it is and the vocals were so satisfying to hear. Jongho\u2019s high note too24. Fire Truck by Nct 127 Haechan\u2019s part is my favorite and Taeil\u2019s high note was amazing.25. Baby Don\u2019t Stop by Nct U Taeyong\u2019s deep voice rapping while Ten\u2019s whispering in the back. Iconic.26. Say My Name by ATEEZ Soothing vocals.Anyways, that\u2019s it. These are some bridges I really liked. I really recommend you listening to Simon Says, Tempo, and Happiness bridges. ~Liz ",
