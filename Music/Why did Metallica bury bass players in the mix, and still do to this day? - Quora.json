            "answer_text": "It\u2019s part of the genre, really. With a few exceptions, most hard rock/metal bass lines are just a doubling of the guitar part, an octave lower. The bass is seen and heard as a bridge to the drums. It\u2019s main job in many genre\u2019s is to complement the guitar(s), not necessarily be an separate, independent voice. Additionally, modern listening habits are different than \u2018back in the day.\u2019 \u2018Boom Boxes\u2019 and hifi stereo\u2019s, car stereo\u2019s and other open air sytems were the norm, not headphones. (This was the early days of walkman, and before the Ipod, and other modern listening devices) The lower frequencies of the bass are often better FELT, than actually heard with just the ears alone. Most headphones don\u2019t really replicate the effect of moving a lot of air and hitting you in the chest like a big proper full speaker system does.  Take an original mix from back then and play it moderately loud in your car. You will hear and feel the bass very differently than listening at polite cafe volumes. ",
