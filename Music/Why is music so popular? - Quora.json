            "answer_text": "Music began in the church. It was awful monotone droning that was not supposed to be enjoyable. I don't know the exact history but at some point, for some reason, the church started experimenting with polytonal hymmns and they started writing down their music. Monotone is one note at a time which doesn't allow for much dynamics or creativity. Polytonal allows for harmony which is basically an enjoyable dissonance between frequencies (notes). When the monotonous sounds from the churches started becoming enjoyable, a split occured that still exists today. Secular Music & Non-Secular Music. Each went in different directions but progressed at an astonishing rate. By the mid 1700s Handel's Mesiah (hallelujah choir) was the pintacle of achievement for the church and in the Secular world Johan Sebastian Bach was pushing the boundaries of what people thought was possible in musical composition. So, If you really want a specific answer, I\u2019d say, the moment the church started experimenting with polytonal modes and structured frequencies which lead to the realization that these sounds were actually enjoyable. Plus, they invented a crude form of dictating music to paper to save their hymmns. That was the start of musical composition. And really, all of Musical Theory as well. I could dive deaper but, I think I\u2019ve answered the question. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me ask a similar question. Why is tasty food so popular? Answer: It pleases and stimulates a sense while at the same time the effort and thought involved to prepare it can be appreciated. Hearing is a more important and sensitive sense than taste, and thus even more pleasure can be derived by \u201cconsuming\u201d music. Bear in mind that \u201cmusic\u201d is a term at least as broad as \u201cfood\u201d and encompasses everything from rhythmic raindrops to rock concerts. ",
