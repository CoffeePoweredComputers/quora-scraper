It is the song for Jin, he\u2019s always so stable and always delivers his notes with ease.  euphoriaSame with Jin, Jungkook delivers his notes with no problems at all. He sings his song perfectly and always goes past the expectations.  mic dropIt\u2019s a very energetic song that easily hypes people up. BTS always kills these performances.  dnaAnother super energetic song, the choreography is enthralling and the transitions they make throughout are super fun to listen to. They almost never struggle with this song.  dionysusNo words needed.  ~flav.r ",
