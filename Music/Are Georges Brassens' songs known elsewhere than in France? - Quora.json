            "answer_text": "As far as I know, George Brassens is not well known in countries where people do not speak french, and have little understanding of french culture. As much as I like Brassens\u2019 voice, I think there are a lot of artists of equal or greater musical talent. But a lot of the charm of his songs comes from the text: their meaning, their poetry and their iconoclastic nature are, in my opinion essential to appreciate what he sings. On the other hand, in countries where people speak french, and have a basic understanding of french cultural norms (the two usually go together), I have found Brassens to be really well known.For instance, all of my Belgian friends know him, and I have met many french speaking Lebanese people who appreciate him a lot too. The importance of texts for Brassens can not be understated, and the fact that he adapted a lot of french poetry into song is a good attestation of that, so Brassens\u2019 popularity will always be linked to the influence of the french language.
