            "answer_text": "You may try yousician. Howrver, if you think about it, all the greatest guitar players never used any digital mediums. Its really hard to judge. After playing the guitar for over 15 years, id highly recommend starting by lets say 5 lessons with a guitarist that matches your interest in music (finding that oerson might not be as easy btw), and hust go sit with this person for 5 sessions, just to learn the basics, and to put yourself on the right track (what you consider to be the right track), and then dont limit yourself with academics. This is a personal, yet hypothetical based answer. So take wht you want from itand leave the rest. If you want a direct answer, Youtube would also do the the job. Best of luck. Id love to listen to how youd progress. Few more advice would be: Its about how much patience and time you are ready to out into the process.Know that theres no wrong or rightIts so important to be/stay original, and express yourself.Technicalities may seem so cool, but thats not all, in fact if you focus on how cool itd look like, then yiu're missing the whole point!Make sure you rarely miss on picking the guitar whenever the inspiration hits you.Learn the basics as early, in order not to continue practicing what's wrong (as in playing on a guitar thats out of tune), as itd be harder to correct the initial mistakesThe more patience you maintain at early stages, the sooner you'll reach that orgasmic stage of speedy, significant progress that'll keep you goingBe your own motivator, and do it because you love it, everything else will followCheck out fingerstyleTry multiple colors, dont stick to a single style, and certainly not even a single bandThe right hand/picking hand is as important as the fretboard hand.Enjoy spendingtime with your new senstive, truly great friend :) ",

            "answer_text": "The best learning program depends on what approach you want to start from. There are a lot of programs that claim to be \u2018the only system you\u2019ll ever need\u2019 and that is simply not true. My system, The Rhythm First Guitar Method, aims at developing strumming strength and rhythm before anything else, or more than anything else in the beginning, then doing chords, scales and songs (songs put everything into proper context). Some people simply want to learn to shred before knowing the basics, then they can\u2019t properly play with others because all they can do is play solos, and their rhythm is weak. Check out some samples below (not just mine, but others as well), and decide which way, and with whom, you want to learn\u2026.hope this helps! I have a system available for $24.95 at http://rhythmmethod.ca which is like a gateway to learning quicker than many other systems (shameless plug, but you asked :-)   Marty Music breaks down popular songs, and he seems like a really great guy:  Troy Grady breaks down really complex guitar styles:  There are lots more out there, just decide the best route for you\u2026cheers!
