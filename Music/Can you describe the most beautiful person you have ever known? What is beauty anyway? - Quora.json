            "answer_text": "Beauty \u2026. For me beauty is not only one\u2019s physical appearence or facial features rather it is something that lies in one\u2019s eyes, heart, soul, mind . Your physical beauty may you lose after a certain age but your inner beauty will not ever fade . Beauty lies in the eyes of beholder . If one wants to see good and beautiful he will see that only but if is impure from inside then he will see the same outside . The most beautiful person I have seen is my Mother . Yes , she is the one who is the master in both physical and internal beauty . I have seen her in all shades of life good vs bad , dark vs light . She never lost her charm . I saw her beautiful since the day I was born till today . She carried her beauty of respect even when her mother in law scolded her , she carried her beauty of love even when my father argued with her , she had the beauty of care even when we annoyed her , she even carries the beauty of motherhood when my children irritate her . She has seen alot in her life but she never let that trouble us . She is the most beautiful she is the most charming one I have seen . I hope she always remainded beautiful as she is and if we talk about the physical beauty she was really so beautiful that I can\u2019t describe her beauty . I can just say she is as beautiful as a cake and I m just a piece of it . Love you maa . It would be my biggest achievement if I be like u even a little . Regards Neelam ",

            "answer_text": "The most beautiful person I\u2019ve known is a male of 18 who looked younger, a guy who was not big or muscular or strong or hairy. In fact he was a girly boy , bissexual, longed for women to love but they just thought we was cute. Guys adored him. He was the perfect twink and had a sweet friendly personality to match his appearance. He had wide set eyes, long eyelashes, perfect skin, wavy hair which he kept just a bit long. He was a musician and had soft supple hands. Even his feet were pretty. I saw him dress as a girl several times, and he not only \u201cpassed\u201d, he was lovelier than 9 of 10 females I have seen. I don\u2019t know how a person such as that can exist. Most women would have died to look the way he did. Unfortunately, he was raped by men several times before he was 20 years old, which caused some bitterness within him. ",
