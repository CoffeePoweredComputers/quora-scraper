            "answer_text": "Depending on your goals, there are different coaches that specialize in different things. Me personally I specialize in finding your unique voice/signature style and building a career with it - brand mentoring. I also help with songwriting and composition. Of course, I do all the other areas of voice teaching and vocal coaching. I do have a free Facebook group where I teach for free and my courses are all online - all supported with a VIP group to answer all your questions and guide you properly. Check out my bio for that. If you like to check out some more Coaches, here are some that I find valuable: Per Bristow, Cheryl Porter, Sam Johnson, Eric Arceneaux. They all specialize in different areas, you just need to find the one that you feel most comfortable with and that you need right now. So trust your gut on this ;) I would not necessarily recommend doing online courses that are unsupervised - unsupported by a dedicated coach. You can do so many mistakes, even if you just imitate a video. Works fine for topics like finances or marketing. But not vocal coaching. Happy Singing *eR ;) E L L A R A Y Soundstonez ",

            "answer_text": "I did not understand the meaning of your question. Let's try to answer on the basis of two hypotheses.a) you are looking for a list of singing teachers published on the internet. I don't know what the situation in your city or country is. Since you look like a beginner I would say to phone or send an email to a singing school or a conservatory asking for information.b) you want to TAKE YOUR CLASSES online.This is an absurd and ridiculous idea and I hope this is not the meaning of your question. Everything that has to do with music (at least classical music) does not have to do with remote action nor with electricity, even, but must be done live. Much of the study of literary, scientific and linguistic subjects can be done with the computer but music, seriously thought, cannot. ",
