            "answer_text": "U.S. perspective: Due to a quirk in copyright law, all audio recordings are protected until 2064. All of them. After that, the normal duration of copyright will apply, life plus 70 years, for the recording artist. If you just meant the sheet music, the duration has changed over the years. Maximum would be 95 years, but recent works are life plus 70. Note, you shouldn't conflate \u201cfree to use\u201d and royalty-free. And neither of those are \u201cpublic domain\u201d. Public domain applies to all works whose copyright has expired.Royalty-free is an arrangement by which the music publisher agrees to license use of the music for a flat fee (possibly zero), but no per-copy royalty.Free to use isn't a legal term. But could describe music offered by recording artist entirely for free, or a public domain work, or misapplied to royalty-free (which might have a flat fee).",

Things made between 1925 and 1978 are more than likely in copyright. Things made before 1924 are in the public domain EXCEPT the guitar and organ arragement for HOUSE OF THE RISING SUN, which is owned by Alan Price and his publishing company (at least 10% worth). ",
