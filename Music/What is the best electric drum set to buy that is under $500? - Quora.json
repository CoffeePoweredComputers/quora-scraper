            "answer_text": "You would get either get a fairly new entry level one or get a second-hand mid-level one at that price range. Some really cheap entry level kits are terrible, but some cheaper Roland/Yamaha and even Alesis kits that I\u2019ve tried have been pretty good for the price range. Alesis Nitro Kit and Roland TD-1K should both be under $500 - check out the guide on this: Electronic Drum Set Reviews and Buyer\u2019s Guide 2017 - Electronic Drum Advisor Otherwise, either check out local listings or sites for second hand options! If doing that then try to get one with a Roland Mesh snare pad or some Yamaha Silicone pads, I think that\u2019s the best benefit of the higher level of electronic drum sets. Martin ",

            "answer_text": "There are several drum sets available on different sites of Internet which are affordable and can also fall under $500. But before buying it from any sites you must undergo through their latest reviews mentioned on the sites. According to me, I think that alesis nitro review is the best. This drum module all feel stunningly realistic for imitations, and it packs a punch in terms of the wide number of built-in sounds and sound sets available to the user. This drum had 108 sounds, and offers 15 programmable drum sets which have the ability to express multiple sounds through a single pad.  ",
