            "answer_text": "In my opinion, if you listen to each of them in their heyday, Plant had the better natural voice (truly a gift), but Daltrey was the better pure singer. If you listen to Roger on the Who\u2019s earliest recordings, then listen to Who\u2019s Next or Quadrophenia, or pretty much anything after that, there\u2019s an amazing evolution of his voice from a standard low pop growl to the earth-shattering range he shows on their most powerful songs (\u201cLove Reign O\u2019er Me,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Free,\u201d \u201cSensation\u201d\u2014the soundtrack versions of the latter two, especially). It\u2019s the mark of a singer really learning his craft. Daltrey just seemed to get better from album to album, while Plant, from years of over-screaming, saw his range diminish until he sounded more and more like a crooner. It\u2019s not coincidental that Robert is at his most dynamic on Zeppelin\u2019s first album and their earliest live recordings. As Laurence Wilson pointed out, Rog isn\u2019t afraid to perform The Who\u2019s material to this day, and he still acquits himself very well; whereas Rob performs very little of Zeppelin\u2019s material. Plant claims it\u2019s musical growth which, if true, you have to respect. But he also knows that he\u2019s not really capable of doing justice to songs like \u201cSince I\u2019ve Been Loving You\u201d or \u201cBlack Dog\u201d anymore without altering them to fit his range, as he and Jimmy Page did (very cleverly) on their arrangements for the \u201cNo Quarter . . . Unledded\u201d album. The fact that Daltrey\u2019s voice has held up as well as it has is either a natural miracle or speaks volumes about his ability to utilize it to its greatest emotional effect without using it up completely. The upside for Plant is that he\u2019s managed to (or been forced to) evolve musically so that he\u2019s always doing something new, while The Who, with only half it\u2019s original members still around, seem content to tour with their oldies\u2014not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that. Musicians have to make a living, and there\u2019s a whole new generation of people who\u2019ve never seen them play, and really should while they have the chance. ",

            "answer_text": "I'd normally say both are as good as each other, it's all about taste blah blah but this one is a no brainer , because as much as I love and admire Plant, Daltrey is the original Rock God. He swings his mic. He's Tommy. He's hard as fuck and he'd knock Plant all over the shop if he had too. His bare chest is more impressive than Plant's and he invented the partially bare chested frontman look. He's McVicar. He's the lead singer in The Who. He'll do a new Who tour at the drop of a hat as long as he can have every other night off, Plant hides from the rest of Led Zeppelin every time he sees them coming. Did I say he was Tommy? Nobody wears shammy leather like Daltrey. His vocals on Love Reign o\u2019er Me, particularly the scream, shatter anything Plant has done, and that's bearing in mind that Plant is so good at singing he could at one time make grown women pee their pants. Robert Plant is a better song writer though, I'll give him that. Daltrey can't hardly write for shit. He doesn't need to, he's Roger fucking Daltrey, Lord of the Rock God's and salmon farmer. The rest of The Who were scared of him. ",
