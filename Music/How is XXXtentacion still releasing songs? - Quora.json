            "answer_text": "An artist usually records a lot more songs than what actually gets released officially. If an album is released with 15 songs on it you can count on there being at least another 20\u201350 songs that didn\u2019t make the album for different types of reasons. These reasons could be label issues, sample clearance issues, collaboration issues amongst artists etc. So what happens when an artist passes away at an early age is that much of this unreleased music usually gets released. The most extreme example of this being Tupac Shakur as he has released an incredible amount of material after his death in 1996. You can always discuss the ethics of this as he probably didn\u2019t want most of this music released in the first place. But that\u2019s the music business and the money is always the main factor behind these decisions. In the case of XXXtentacion I\u2019m sure you will still hear much \u201cnew\u201d music from in the years to come. The question is, would he want that music to be released if he was still alive? ",

            "answer_text": "It's a similar situation to lil peepers. When he died in November of 2017 his music was claimed by whatever label he was owned by and sold to artists such as fall out boy. This same effect took place when x died but this time his mother Cleo has full control of the music X has gracefully left behind. But Cleo makes a lot of the big decisions such as releasing info on new songs. But x has been milked for profit by having songs sold to Kanye west, the Spiderman homecoming soundtrack, and several other popular artists. ",
