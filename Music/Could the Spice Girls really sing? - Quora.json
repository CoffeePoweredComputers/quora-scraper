            "answer_text": "They could all sing technically for sure. Victoria went to a performing arts school before joining the group and so did Mel B & C along with Emma, Geri had no standard performing arts training but she can sing. There are various levels of singing and none of them were exactly Mariah Carey standard or extremely strong singers but they could harmonise and sounded really good together and each girl has a distinct voice that works well in different places. E.g. Emma and Mel C would tend to sing the high notes, Geri and Mel B would sing in the lower range and Victoria was fairly middle but usually joining the lower range. ",

But to answer the question of \u201ccan the spice girls really sing\u201d I would say the answer is basically mixed: some members of the group had superb voices, and others not so much. Victoria, Mel C, Geri and Emma had very strong voices. Mel B did not. ",
