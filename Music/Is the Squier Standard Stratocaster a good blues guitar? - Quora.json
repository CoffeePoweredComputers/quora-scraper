            "answer_text": "As with most things guitar, the fingers in contact with the fretboard account for 90% of the sound. That said, the Squier Stat is a fine guitar for playing blues. Not my favorite but, not a bad choice. The neck pickup played with a pinch of overdrive and delay gives an excellent bluesy tone. Select both pickups and dial back the tone on the bridge pickup and you\u2019ll be impressed with expression. The bridge pickup, by itself, is too twangy for a good blue sound. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Any kind of Strat makes a good Blues guitar. Squire has been making better guitars the past decade. They used to have a real bad reputation, but a friend picked up a Sea Foam Green Squire Strat 6 months ago and it is a much better instrument that I thought it would be for less than $300 dollars. I still hate Sea Foam Green , but \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. That said, any guitar can play the Blues. The tone is in the hands of the guitarist. ",
