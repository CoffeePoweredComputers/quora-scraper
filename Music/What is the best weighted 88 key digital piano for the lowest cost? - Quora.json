            "answer_text": "I have given this answer on different post but it applies to your situation. So what are your musical goals? Are they to play a song for your family every now and then? Are they to play in a local band that performs every month or so? Are they to be the next great songwriter? Or the next Jerry Lee Lewis? Are you planning to sit examinations? Whatever your goals are you need to be familiar with them because this will determine the kind of piano you will need. If you are only going to play for friends and family, your ability may not be at a level (as you are not playing very often) that requires all 88 keys or even pedals. So you may be able to use a small portable keyboard. Not only will this save you money but it will give you the option to play chords with one finger or even program backing tracks. If you were looking to play in a local band then you may need something a bit bigger and a little more flexible. Because of the nature of local bands, you may end up playing different kinds of musical sounds (like brass or string sounds) as well as playing piano parts. This means you will need all 88 keys, pedals and the option of playing different musical sounds. And because you will be travelling it will need to be portable. So a good quality keyboard will be fine. If you want to use your piano for songwriting it depends on what role the piano will play in this process. If you will be writing complex piano pieces you will need something similar to what you would need if you were playing in a band. But if you will only be using it to enter notes into a computer, it would need to be compatible with your computer (and have the right software). You may not even need all 88 keys. For these first few examples, weighted keys will not be important nor will the width of the keys, as these are features that do not relate to what the instrument is being used for The feel and width of the keys in these instances are more to do with personal preference. For examinations you will either need a real piano or something that feels as much like a piano as possible. It will need 88 standard-width keys, pedals and be weighted (the keys need to feel like the keys on an acoustic piano). The examinations will be performed on an acoustic piano and you will need to practice on something that simulates the feel and sound of a piano as much as possible. Once we know what your goals are then we can look at the practicalities involved with the type of piano that is best for you. How much space do you have? This is an important question to ask because if you need an acoustic piano and you have your heart set on a full-size grand piano but you live in a small top floor apartment with no lift, it may be impossible or extremely expensive to get it into position. So does the piano that is best for you also fit in the space that it needs to go? If not we need to get as close as we can while keeping the components that are important to our goals. If you are doing exams then you will need a keyboard that feels like an acoustic piano so that you will be able to practice on something that is similar to an acoustic piano. This can be achieved in a few ways, the first is by getting an upright piano. Uprights take up less space and are easier to fit into smaller spaces. If an upright is still too large for the space, the second option would be a weighted electronic piano or keyboard. Once again, this would need to have standard width keys. Now, if you wanted something to use in a band situation then a grand piano is out of the question and so is a upright for the simple reason that these pianos cannot be transported easily. so you would start of looking at an electronic piano or keyboard. Now if you require the piano to make a lot of different instrument sounds then you will need something capable of producing these sounds but things like keyboard width and weighted keys are optional. The same type of instrument is suitable for a person that is looking to compose complex pieces but is not applicable to some body trying to program notes in to a computer. For this task all that is needed is a small keyboard that is compatable with the computer you are using. Now the last and what will be the most important factor is the price. Now if price wasn\u2019t an issue we would have the best sounding coolest looking and most hi tech instrument available sitting in the piano room of our mansion but unfourtunatley for most of us we don\u2019t have this choice. So how do we get all of the features we want at the price we want? Now there are a lot of pianos and keyboards available and depending what you need them for you can spend under one hundred or could spend in to the tens of thousands. Buying pianos or keyboards especially well known brands new can be expensive but if you want some thing that has a decent warranty and a proven track record then this is the way to go. If you are willing to look at other makes then you might be able to get some thing that fits the bill at a reduced rate because the brand name is not that well known. The only way to know if you are buying a dud or a hidden treasure is to do some research. Now to do that look at the specs for the piano are they right for you? Will they do the job? Is it a practical instrument for you? If so then how do you know that it will do the job you need it to do. Try it out that will be the easiest way to tell if the piano does what you need it to do and most good piano/keyboard outlets will let you spend time making sure that you are making the best choice. Ask questions. If it is a piano. How much does it weigh? Will the removalist be able to get it in to my house? if it is a keyboard. How are the keys weighted? as older or lesser quality electronic pianos have springs to create the feeling of weight but the higher quality and newer instruments have a mechanism that feel very close to an acoustic piano. Do you have any reviews? Does it come with a warranty? You can also look at some of the reputable review sites or forums online these are usually real people who have tried these instruments. Ask your piano teacher if they are familiar with the brand. If you are looking in to playing in a band ask other musicians. Is it hard to transport? Is it reliable? What is the sound quality like? If you are going to use it to input music into a computer. Will it be compatable with my computer? Will I need more software? Will I need to buy any accessories? If you are satisfied with the way the instrument sounds and it does what you need it to do and you are happy with the answers for the questions and research you have done then this may be the piano for you. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "You can get an 88-key weighted keyboard controller that you can hook up to an iPad with Garageband or a computer with piano VSTs. I assume your piano will stay at home, so hooking it up to a computer or iPad wouldn\u2019t be much of a problem. Of course, a keyboard controller isn\u2019t the best keyboard for piano playing out there, but they\u2019re (semi-) weighted, and costs around half to 3/4 of your budget, assuming you already have either a computer or iPad.
