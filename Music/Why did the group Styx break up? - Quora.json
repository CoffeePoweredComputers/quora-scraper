            "answer_text": "Styx. Awesome as I have been a huge fan since high school. High school was a while ago. ;-\\ Ok, the band Styx came into being way back in 1961 when twin brothers Chuck and John Panozzo along with friend Dennis DeYoung began playing music together. The guys were very young with the twins being a whopping 12 yrs old. Tom Nardin joined the band a bit later. Chuck played bass, John was on drums and DeYoung played accordian and sang but would switch to playing keyboards in time. They went by the name Tradewinds until another band by the same name found public recognition in 1965 and the fellows became TW4 (there were 4) They played locally in Chicago graduating to playing high school dances and parties while attending Chicago State University in the latter 1960\u2019s. In 1969 John Curulewski joined the band with James Young following suit in 1970 and the lineup was formed. In 1972 the band was signed to Wooden Nickel records after being spotted by a talent scout . After being advised a few things , one being a new name was needed . So after a bit of debate the guys settled on \u201c Styx\u201d as in DeYoungs words \u201cit was the only one that none of us hated\u201d.  The band released four albums over the next several years and with moderate success , but in 1974 the ballad \u201c Lady\u201d from the Styx II album began to take off. In1977 they released the album Grand Illusion which went Triple Platinum . They found the fame they sought.  In 1981 they released a concept album called Paradise Theatre, which was a huge hit also going muti-platinum in sales. In .1983 they released a second concept album called Kilroy Was Here and again another smash hit album. Kilroy was Here was also a far more complex album and storyline but quickly went Platinum. A stage show was assembled featuring theatrical presentations of three songs with the band members in costume enacting various scenes.  The show was complex and expensive to produce and the tour was not as profitable as hoped . The whole Kilroy Was Here project took it\u2019s toll on the members and not long after the end of the tour the band had all gone their separate ways. The group reformed in 1990 but with slight lineup change, released one album but by the end of 1991 had disbanded again.  Then in 1995, reformed once again with yet another lineup change and went on to release a couple of albums. From that point on the band continued in various forms . But Styx as I knew them, well that band ended after Kilroy, but Styx lumbers on\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "The group Styx was on a roll like few others between 1977 and 1981. Four multiplatinum albums in a row. Sold-out concerts. Massive singles success on the radio. Styx probably did more than any other band to bring progressive rock into the Top 40. Behind the scenes, however, friction was building up. The group's de facto leader, keyboardist Dennis DeYoung, wished to steer Styx into a more theatrical direction; while the band's other vocalists, guitarists Tommy Shaw and James \u201cJY\u201d Young felt that the band was straying too far from its hard rock roots. These two men reportedly hated \u201cFirst Time\u201d and even \u201cBabe\u201d, ballads which DeYoung brought to 1979\u2019s Cornerstone album, the latter of which became a No. 1 hit for Styx. Years later, during Tommy Shaw's stint in the hard rock supergroup Damn Yankees, he and the rest of that band would make fun of \u201cBabe\u201d every night on stage, which hurt Dennis DeYoung very much. When Styx unleashed the concept album Kilroy Was Here in 1983, the tensions were reaching a boiling point. Though the album produced a gold-selling single in \u201cMr. Roboto\u201d, it was clear that Styx's glory days were over. The band shot a short film to promote the basic concept of the album-a near-future society where rock 'n' roll music is outlawed, with band members playing characters in this narrative. Dennis DeYoung insisted that this film be shown each night at the arena before the band hit the stage. One night, the movie was unable to be shown because of a technical glitch. Rather than just scrap the film and play the concert anyway, DeYoung cancelled the entire show. This did not sit well with the rest of the band or the fans, needless to say. DeYoung felt that the short film was integral to experiencing the new music. The following year, Styx released a double live album, Caught in the Act, including a new studio track, \u201cMusic Time.\u201d The band shot a video for this song, which was issued as a single. One particular scene in the video Tommy Shaw refused to take part in, believing that it was just too silly. I believe that Tommy made the decision to quit then and there, with the others not far behind. The fall of 1984 saw the release of the debut solo albums by Dennis DeYoung (Desert Moon) and Tommy Shaw (Girls With Guns). James \u201cJY\u201d Young would follow suit the next year with City Slicker. Styx was officially on hiatus. The band reunited in 1990 to release Edge of the Century, absent Shaw who was in Damn Yankees at the time. The album was a modest success. One single, the Dennis DeYoung power ballad \u201cShow Me the Way\u201d, became a surprise hit due to its connection with the Gulf War of 1991. Tragically in 1996, Styx drummer John Panozzo would die of cirrhosis of the liver at the age of 47. Around the same time the rest of the classic lineup of Styx reformed, with Tommy Shaw rejoining the fold. The band would release a new studio album in 1999, Brave New World. A tour to support the album was planned. However, Dennis DeYoung had by then developed an intense sensitivity to light which made playing live painful. Dennis asked the band to wait a while until his condition hopefully improved, but his bandmates went ahead without him. Hiring a replacement keyboardist, they hit the road and have been recording and touring as Styx ever since. Guitarist James Young once said of the decision to go on without DeYoung, \u201cIt was his (Dennis's) way or the highway. We chose the highway.\u201d I wish that these very talented men could one day put their differences aside and work together again, but that scenario looks very unlikely. ",
