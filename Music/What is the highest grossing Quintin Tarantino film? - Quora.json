            "answer_text": "So far..Django unchained. Worldwide, BUT this is without adjusted of ticket inflation. Worldwide it has grossed 425 million, though it was made for 100 million dollars. Interesting, pulp fiction was made for 8 million dollars and it has grossed 214 million worldwide. I would say that\u2019s his most successful work as far as money. He writes all his work so he is making a profit, as a writer it ranks as Django, once upon a time in America, inglorious bastards and pulp fiction in rank. Incredible guy who has always figured out what he was doing, before it hit the table. Genius. ",
