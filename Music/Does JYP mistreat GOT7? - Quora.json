            "answer_text": "Mistreatment ? Well yes . I'll give you a few examples over the years of their mistreatment .  Announce the comeback and launch the world tour at the same time . Usually, Kpop groups just announce either their comeback or the tour so that their fans have time to prepare the money to support their idol. However, JYP didn\u2019t let the fans do it when they announced both at the same time. Not many fans are financially able to buy an album and a concert ticket, so they\u2019ll have to choose between them. This has caused GOT7\u2019s album sales to decline compared to previous comebacks.GIVE NO NOTICE OF MV RELEASE TIMENormally before every comeback, the agency will release the poster and MV teaser with the full information of date and time to release the MV so the fans can increase MV views for their idols in the first 24 hours. But in the teaser of the \u201cECLIPSE\u201d MV, there is no information about what time the MV would be released. Not knowing the specific release time, all the preparations and the efforts to increase the views of the Ahgase are ruined 3. DOESN\u2019T RELEASE ENOUGH ALBUMS While the fans are trying hard to buy albums to increase sales for GOT7, one of Korea\u2019s reputable album buying sites, Synnara, apologized for not having enough albums to sell. In the first week, most of the album sales come from the pre-order amount. JYP must have a full preparation of the number of albums released but in fact, they didn\u2019t have enough albums to sell on the 2nd day. 4. EXTREMELY LIMITED PROMOTION PERIOD For their last comeback Dye , they promoted only for a week while other groups usually promote for 2 weeks or more . 5. NOT ALLOWING CREATIVE FREEDOM JB is a skilled producer but unfortunately he himself has stated that most of his songs get rejected . Jackson Wang , Bambam , Jinyoung are skilled songwriters and composers but if you check out the track listing for their songs , they only have contributed to a few songs . 6.NOT ENOUGH SAFETY MEASURES A lot of the members have reported saesang fans lurking around their houses for months on and on . Some members have told about getting many calls from fans . Ahgase tried to get JYP to take some action but their response was rather late . CONCLUSION It's true that in the first 2 years of GOT7's career , JYP took some serious promotional measures the kind of promotions we get with Twice right now . But unfortunately as their songs failed to perform well on the charts and their popularity compared to other Big 3 groups like Exo and Bigbang was very low ,JYP slowly started to stop investing in them . Their most successful song upto now has been \u201cHard Carry\" in Korea but after that although their international popularity increased , in Korea they still had a low popularity as a Big 3 group .  JYP is a good company in terms of treating their artists and they are the least hated in BIG3. But the way they promoted GOT7 really made many fans feel helpless because of the lack of professionalism when such a large entertainment company promote so poorly for their main boy group at the present. GOT7 is not a famous name in Korea although they have debuted for 7 years. Maybe because they are unfortunate and haven\u2019t had a national hit to stand out. But the way JYP promoted them is also a reason why GOT7 couldn\u2019t become one of the top groups in Korea. Peace ",
