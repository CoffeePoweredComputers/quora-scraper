            "answer_text": "As always, depends on many factors. Some folks are born naturally gifted. They are born into a family that sings a lot. They begin experimenting with their voice at a very young age. They imitate good singers (perhaps relatives that live with or near them) and their voices get strong at a very young age. They constantly improve and hone their technique. Others have to be taught. I\u2019m convinced everyone can learn to sing. Those who have no real experience have to learn how to stay on pitch. Just like any other instrument, you have to practice. If you practice a lot, you\u2019ll get better quicker. I\u2019ve had guitar students who become sensational over a summer. From no experience to playing lead guitar in a band in a matter of two months. What do they almost always have in common? Incessant practice. Voice students are usually different. Many who come in to start lessons have been \u201cpracticing\u201d for a number of years. But they\u2019ve been practicing bad habits. Any person who practices any instrument incorrectly will struggle to learn. The longer you\u2019ve developed bad habits the harder it is to break them. Your voice is no exception. If you want to get a good voice, you need a good teacher. Someone you trust, someone you will listen to. If you go all out, committed to improving your technique, you can strengthen your voice and notice improvement in a matter of weeks. Make it a top priority and you could have a much better voice after a couple of months of hard work. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends wildly on what if anything is holding you back. Maybe you just need a few lessons on breathing, so you can go from one bar phrases to four bar phrases without falling over from lack of oxygen or sounding pinched. Maybe you\u2019ve never seriously paid attention to music before and some poor teacher has to train your ear in the entire Western harmonic tradition before you can sing on pitch. It could be anything from a couple of weeks to a couple of years. ",
