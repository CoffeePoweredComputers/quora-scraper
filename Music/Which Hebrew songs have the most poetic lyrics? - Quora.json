            "answer_text": "I'm a huge fan of this particular masterpiece by Roni Dalumi, called \u2018Hold Her\u2019. The powerful lyrics, coupled with the grandiose music and her angelic voice, really manage to hit me in the feels every time. Are they the most poetic lyrics out there? Probably not. But since I've gone ahead and translated the lyrics anyways (someone on YouTube asked nicely), I might as well share it here. This is the song, and the lyrics are down below. Enjoy!  Hold Her She's slightly losing her balance She's signaling to me that it isn't easy She's slightly shaking Slightly unstable Hold her * She's slowly rebuilding walls of silence While still trying to unload her burden She's a little confused Her head is spinning Stop it * She will search every dark corridor In every box, in every pocket of frayed dresses She'll know how to pass the nights By caressing the wounds, by climbing the walls She'll find everything she lost along the way It'll burn a bit, then be forgotten * She's finding it slightly difficult to hold on Gets slightly angry, and once more declares: \"I'm not being wild\" But she's still all mixed up Hold her * She will search every dark corridor In every box, in every pocket of frayed dresses She'll know how to pass the nights By caressing the wounds, by climbing the walls She'll find everything she lost along the way It'll burn a bit... * She will search every dark corridor In every box, in every pocket of frayed dresses She'll touch, and know How it feels to drown in hidden puddles And to reopen wounds left untouched for a while She'll find everything she lost along the way It'll burn a bit, then be forgotten ",

Here\u2019re several songs (I\u2019m adding some translations to English I\u2019ve found\u2026 many not very successful on my opinion and some are just literal but poetry translation is almost impossible task anyway) \u201c\u05e2\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d7\u05d5\u05d6\u05e8 \u05d4\u05e0\u05d9\u05d2\u05d5\u05df\u201d \u201cStill the music returns\u201d Music: Naftali Alter  Music: Nachum Heiman  Still the music returns you abandoned in vain Still the path stretches on, long and wide And a cloud in its sky and a tree in its rain Are expecting you still, passerby. The wind will rise and like swings in their flight Bolts of lightning will flash overhead The lamb and the she-deer will both testify That you stroked them and pressed on ahead, That your hands are quite empty, your city remote And you\u2019ve bent your knee many a time To a green grove, a woman\u2019s glad throat And a treetop with raindrop-lashed eyes. \u05e4\u05d2\u05d9\u05e9\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05e7\u05e5 Unending Meeting Music: Naomi Shemer  (literal translation) Because you have stormed upon me I shall forever sing youIn vain will I surround you with walls, in vain erect gatesMy desire is to you and to me - your gardenAnd towards me my handless body swoons You alone are the sin and the judge of citiesForever sudden, my eyes are concussed upon youWhile in a warring street, bleeding raspberry sunsets,You will bind me in sheaves Do not plead to those who retreat from approachingIn your lands I alone will be wandererMy prayer asks for nothing at allMy prayer is one and it says - take Until the ends of sorrow, until the ends of nightIn streets of iron, empty and longMy God commanded me to carry to your infantsAlmonds and raisins from my great impoverishment It is good that your hand still captures our heartDo not pity it when it tires of runningDo not allow it to darken like the roomLeft without the stars that have remained outside There the moon blazes as the cook\u2019s kissThere a damp sky thunders its coughThere a tree lowers its branch for me as a handkerchiefAnd I will pick it up and bowAnd I know that, to the beating of the drumIn commerce cities, deaf and pained,One day I will yet fall with wounded head to pluckThis smile of ours from among the chariots \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05e4\u05dc\u05d8 Elifelet Music: Sasha Argov  Let us sing a Song of Elifelet. Let\u2019s recite it together out loud. How when he was a tyke, a young fellow \u2014 A real klutz, a schlimazel, avowed. All the neighbors and folks they would prattle, \u201cHe\u2019s plain hopeless,\u201d upon him they\u2019d pounce. \u201cElifelet\u2019s a boy without mettle, Without character, even an ounce.\u201d If you grab from his hands a new plaything, He just sits there agape with a grin. Yes he\u2019s smiles, not knowing the reason What a smile\u2019s for or when to begin. And the neighbors they all looked askance, That a pin drop would cause him to dance, Without questioning \u201cwhy\u2019 or \u201cwherefore\u201d, No \u201cifs\u201d, or \u201cbuts\u201d, or \u201cmaybe\u201d, No \u201cwhen to begin\u201d or \u201cwhat for?\u201d No \u201chow much\u201d or \u201cno, that\u2019s crazy.\u201d As if lost in a musical score With a melody clear as a bell hit. If we ask you \u201cWhat good is that for? What a child you are, Elifelet!\u201d One night battle erupted, a firefight And the men of the company heard That the forward position was cut off, Ammunition all gone, not a word. Elifelet, he felt some compulsion To replenish his comrades\u2019 supply. Not an ounce of much character in him, He crawled straight toward the firing line. When he made it back, addled and injured, He collapsed to the floor, with a grin. Yes he smiled, not knowing the reason What a smile\u2019s for or when to begin. And his friends in their hearts cast a glance \u2013 Yes a pin drop would cause him to dance, Without questioning \u201cwhy\u2019 or \u201cwherefore\u201d, No \u201cifs\u201d, or \u201cbuts\u201d, or \u201cmaybe\u201d, No \u201cwhen to begin\u201d or \u201cwhat for?\u201d No \u201chow much\u201d or \u201cno, that\u2019s crazy.\u201d As if lost in a musical score With a melody clear as a bell hit. If we ask you \u201cWhat good is that for? What a child you are, Elifelet!\u201d Yes that night in a battlefield helmet Gabriel, the Archangel, came down, Near the resting head of Elifelet, In the outpost, on top of a mound. He said: \u201cHave no more fear, Elifelet, Take thee courage, for I do pronounce In the Heavens we\u2019re proud and we\u2019re jealous, Of your character, less than an ounce.\u201d It\u2019s a simple song, yet quite astounding, Without middle, beginning, or end, Let us sing it, not knowing the reason What a song\u2019s for or where to begin. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- From several other Israeli poets: Nathan Zach \u201c\u05e2\u05e5 \u05d4\u05e9\u05d3\u05d4\u201d \u201cBecause the man is the tree of the field\u201d  Music: Shalom Hanoch Because the man is the tree of the field;  Like the tree the man grows up. Like the man, the tree also gets uprooted, And I surely do not know where I have been and where I will be, like the tree of the field. Because the man is the tree of the field; Like the tree he aspires upwards. Like the man, he gets burnt in fire, And I surely do not know where I have been and where will I be, like the tree of the field. Because the man is the tree of the field; Like the tree he is thirsty to water. Like the man, thirsty he remains, And I surely do not know where I have been and where will I be, like the tree of the field. I've loved, and I've hated; I've tasted both this and that; I was buried in a plot of land; And it's bitter, it's bitter in my mouth, Like the tree of the field; Like the tree of the field.

You like to be  Sad and silent  To listen to a story about a something close, something far,  And I, that not once I'll be watching you silently,  no sound or words  Forgetting everything about other people.  My soul resides within the walls of your home  Captive between your walls, set apart from me,  As I in my body apart from you.   Stretched out is my dream as a rug to your feet,  Pace, beloved on its flowers of your paces  Wear your pink robe before night,  In a short while I will come to you.   And your black gold adorned forehead  will come close to my lips like a rhyme to a song,  when I whisper to your ear till the morning, till dawn Lea Goldberg \u05de\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05d0\u05d4\u05d1\u05ea\u05d9 From songs of my love land Music: Dafna Eilat  (literal translation) My homeland, a poor flower land -The queen has no house, the king got no crown And the spring comes only for seven days a year And the rest of it - darkness, clouds and rain But for seven days the roses are blumming And for seven days the dew shines And for seven days the windows stay open And all your baggers are standing out by the street And endure their pale faces towards the carrying light And all your baggers are merry My homeland, a poor flower land - The queen has no house, the king got no crown Only seven days there are holidays, in the all year long And the rest of it - labor and starvation But seven days the candles are blessed And for seven days tables ready for fest And for seven days the hearts are wide open And all your baggers stands in pray And your sons and daughters being bridge and bridegroom And all your baggers are being brothers My miserable, my poor and bitterThe queen has no house, the king got no crown - Only one in the all world spoked praise on you And the rest - on your disgrace and shame And therefor I will go to any street and corner, To every market and yard and alleyway and garden, And from your demolished walls, every little stone - I will pick up and save as a souvenir. And from city to city, from country to countryI will wander around with a song, and a music-boxTo mourn your glowing poverty.
