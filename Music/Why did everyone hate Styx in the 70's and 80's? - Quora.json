            "answer_text": "They were characterized by this pseudo-intellectual exclusivity, poster poetry and defiant musical fanfare. In general, their style, containing baroque elements, was very pleasant for the audience. During their concerts, the band often allowed themselves to flood the audience with the sounds of unbearable volume, which Aerosmith could envy. Styx had to wait a long time for their music to be in the listeners' interest. They played together since 1963 and didn't start recording until the 70's. But it was Equinox (A&M 1975) and the big hit Lady, reissued in 1976, that opened the door for them to the \"high society\" of the American show business, where the band finally entered with the \"platinum\" album The Grand Illusion, containing the big hit Come Sail Away. Restored in their recordings the atmosphere of \"psychedelic dawn\" (especially the 1978 hit Renegade), Styx, unlike Boston, didn't bother to use synthesizers, motley dress and defiantly keep themselves on stage, blow up colored smoke bombs. But when listening to their music, with soft acoustic guitars, with a chorus in the spirit of Yes, it became obvious that Styx are set to prevail refinement in creations over the energy of radical rock. Eventually Styx turned out to be one of the bands that managed to combine in their work almost all the fashionable and important tendencies typical for pop music of the second half of the 70's. Styx was a form of rock that primarily cared about the impression and sound completeness, while other factors - naturalness, spontaneity and originality - were considered secondary. On this occasion, many critics still have fierce arguments, but in the end all decide the money. ",

            "answer_text": "Styx was one of the biggest bands there were in the mid-to late 70s, at least in the midwest where I grew up. I personally couldn\u2019t get enough of their albums from Equinox to Pieces of Eight, (1975\u20131978) Three different members could sing lead. Each one had a distinctive voice, which lent some variety to their sound. They were also able, in my opinion, to play quiet stuff as well as the big guitar parts, and were especially good at starting with the former, and ending with the latter. (Come Sail Away, Suite Madam Blue, Renegade, Castle Walls etc.) They were over-synthesized, like most 70s bands, but that was the style then. They also played acoustic stuff, and even a pipe organ on I\u2019m OK. In any case, I liked them a lot. Cornerstone, from 1979, was the beginning of their downward spiral: Dennis DeYoung, as I recall, wanted to go more pop. The rest of the band wanted to rock. The most dreadful song they did, Babe, was from this album. Paradise Theater (1981, I think) was a partial return to their late 70\u2019s sound, but I think by that time the internal strife was taking its toll. I guess Mr. Roboto was the last album on the contract they were under at the time, and the album done just to satisfy the legal obligation. I actually saw them for the only time on this tour. The music was good, but the theatrics of acting out the Mr. Roboto story was just silly. Even then, the house was packed. ",
