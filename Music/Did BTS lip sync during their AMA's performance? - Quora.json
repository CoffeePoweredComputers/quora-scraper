            "answer_text": "No. They did not lip sync, and they never have and never will. Honestly, America doesn\u2019t give a crap about BTS. Did you even listen to the interview questions? \u201cWho\u2019s your American celebrity crush? What do you like the most about America? Which artist would you like to collaborate with? What do you like most about LA that you don\u2019t often see/have in South Korea? Will you be making an English album?\u201d They never asked them about their DNA album, their own selves, and rarely mentioned Korea. Due to the fact that America couldn\u2019t care less, that lead to the faulty, low microphone quality of when the performed on the AMAs. Right after the loved Kelly Clarskon\u2019s performance, the stage crew probably thought \u201cOh, let\u2019s just do whatever and not really focus on the next group (ahem BTS).\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s cut out the ARMY\u2019s fanchants since it \u2018ruins\u2019 the sound quality as well.\u201d Their voices were choppy and cut out, making it sound like they were lip syncing when they didn\u2019t at all. If you were to see the fan cameras, they would display it from different POVs but with a somewhat better recording. I highly doubt that you would go watch their live videos of their other successful concerts to hear them sing from their heart rather than lip syncing, but if you\u2019re still not convinced then go do so.  [Edit: The guys don\u2019t lip sync, but they do have a recording playing in the background. They don\u2019t mouth the words, but they actually sing/rap their parts. Sometimes for intense dance breaks, they have to catch their breath. This is an understandable misunderstanding that has them accused of lip syncing because of the soundtracks playing in the background. Lip syncing is mouthing the words along with the song, which is faking it. The boys do not fake anything. They don\u2019t even attempt to mouth the words as they regain their breath. BTS Jimin's voice crack In this video, if they were using pre-recorded songs then there wouldn\u2019t have been a hilarious mistake like this.  2017 SBS Gayo Daejun performance on Mic Drop. Suga proves they don\u2019t lip sync with his pauses.] ",

            "answer_text": "I'll tell you exactly what happened during their American Debut during AMA's : The AMA's fucked up big time. The video which was released on YouTube muted all the fanchants and played the playback louder in the official video that they released on YouTube. So here's what I did. I searched up for the Fancams. In the fancams, it is quite clear that they are singing because you can see that RM's mics were failing and he was tapping it to check. You can see hear Suga breathing hard into the mic. You can see V adjusting his mic piece to hear the voices. So why did AMA's manipulate the audio? The fanchants were too loud for the song to be heard. In a way, for the non-army's AMA's did a favour by letting them hear the song. But AMA didn't know that half the fun in Kpop is the fanchants! They were either unaware or had no clue how Kpop works. The camera work was terrible too. Armys were obviously enraged because the fanchants ( which were amazing btw!) were muted and the camera kept zooming on to random people in the crowd thus missing out important parts of the boys' choreography and performance. Overall, AMA's messed up big time. BTS didn't lipsync AT ALL. Not even the hard parts. Most artists have a playback and there is nothing to be ashamed of that, but BTS didn't even have a playback. The audio was manipulated in the official release by AMA. I sincerely suggest you to look up the fancams. Bless those fans who captured Kpop in all its essence! ",

            "answer_text": "No. BTS (at least in my knowledge) have never lip-synced during any of their live performances. They take the effort to both dance to the song while singing along. This is something that takes a lot of effort and practice. Yes, the real recorded audio was being played over the speakers but it was only the off-vocal version. If you watch the YouTube video or the fan cams, you can hear the places where they take breaths or the spots where the mic didn\u2019t register their voices. Namjoon (RM) had a lot of places where his vice sounded choppy because all their mics were set to a low setting. I don\u2019t know why they did this, but it rendered many of the member\u2019s voices choppy and uneven, providing the impression that they were lip-syncing. If you search up BTS without auto-tune, you can see that they sound very similar to their published audio version. I feel that many Americans find it unrealistic that many K-Pop groups can dance with great talent while also singing but it is true. I can\u2019t think of any K-Pop group that lipsyncs during performances (there may be some) but I do know that BTS most definitely does NOT. I hope that helps you. ",

I was a lil bit disappointed. Then when I saw fancams and then I was even more mad about the shitty camerawork by AMAs. Seriously? It's like they did our boys wrong because they were afraid they take over America. They did not lipsync, they sang live and were really good. The dancing was soooo on point. From the fancams I was able to see BTS AT THEIR TOTAL BEST WHICH WAS NOT SEEN AT ALL BY THE ORIGINAL VID. SOOO BTS DID NOT AT ALL LIP SYNC AT THE AMAs AND YOU CANNOT SEE HOW GOOD THEY ARE FROM WHAT AMAs filmed ",

Even throught the performance they still cheered really loud o the point where the actual music wasnt as loud. The producers had to reduce the noise of the fans which effected the audio of the performance as well. They added in the original Mv ( Not that much just slightly so you can still hear the song ). However, THIS WAS ONLY FOR THE TV, THE PRODUCERS DID NOT ADD IN THEMUSIC DURING THE ACTUAL SHOW. SO THEY DID NOT LIP SYNC THANK YOU ",
