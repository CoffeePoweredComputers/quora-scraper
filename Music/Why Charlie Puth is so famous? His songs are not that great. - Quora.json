            "answer_text": "I disagree, Charlie Puth atleast to me seems to be the most talented musician out there (quite there with Bruno Mars) among major pop/rap stars like : Justin Bieber, Ed Sheeran, Drake, The Weeknd, etc\u2026\u2026\u2026 The WHOLE WORLD literally everyone was gaga over Ed Sheeran\u2019s \u201cShape of You\u201d, Luis Fonsi\u2019s \u201cDespacito\u201d, or even Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cHumble\u201d last year in 2017 mainstream music but I was gaga over Charlie\u2019s \u201cAttention\u201d more so than Kendrick, Drake, Luis Fonsi, or Ed Sheeran. & This year while the whole world is gaga over Cardi B\u2019s \u201cI Like It\u201d, or Drake\u2019s \u201cGod\u2019s Plan\u201d, I again this year was most excited by Puth\u2019s \u201cThe Way I Am\u201d. Anyways love Charlie & his cool soothing melodic music !!!!! :) :) In his single, / song \u201cAttention\u201d, Charlie\u2019s falsettos are just AMAZING to start off with while criticizing his ex-girlfriend in the song of being right there in every LA party where Puth goes by just to seek Puth\u2019s attention   In his new single / song, \u201cThe Way I Am\u201d, Puth at the start of the song complements his vocals / rap fast along with the beat, again the guy is a great singer / falsetto\u2019s are amazing, & excellent ear for melody   ",

            "answer_text": "Actually he isn\u2019t really that famous compared to artists like Ed Sheeran, Shawn Mendes & Taylor Swift etc. The only reason he got popular was because of the collab on See You Again and We Don\u2019t Talk Anymore, but other than his own hit \u201cAttention\u201d he really isn\u2019t that popular in terms of pop artists. I could understand why the songs on Nine Track Mind (his debut album - 2016) weren\u2019t that great, I definitely agree there were cheesy lyrics and the album was just a cluster of ideas mixed and mashed together. The worst song being Marvin Gaye, ughhhh. VoiceNotes is so much better in every single regard and really shows his artistry. \u201cAttention\u201d is the reason I love this lad. ",
