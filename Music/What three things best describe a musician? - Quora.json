            "answer_text": "The ability to play at least one instrument (this includes one's voice) to a competent enough level to appeal to a listener\u2019s ear.Having an inert \u201cfeel\" for music and being able to compose some form of musical theme from scratch.Having enough base level musical knowledge to work harmoniously with other musicians.Everything else is arbitrary in my opinion. Point 3, for example, does not imply that you need to actually work with other musicians. Just have the potential to. It could be argued that a drunk man bashing a bin lid against a wall is music. It's not. Not until it works in a context that allows listeners to recognise something \u201cmusical\" in what they're hearing. Point 2 does not require you to be able to read notation or compose grand pieces of music. If you can come up with a bassline just by feeling the notes then you are a musician. The bottom line is, levels of musicianship range massively. But with those three qualities in stock there's no good reason not to consider yourself a musician. ",
