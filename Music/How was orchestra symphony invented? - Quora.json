            "answer_text": "The short answer is that it came about as a result of the invention of Opera in 1600. Our idea of an \u2018orchestra\u2019\u2026 a combination of winds/brass/percussion with strings taking the primary role starts to be evident in the works of Monteverdi. It\u2019s primarily an Italian invention. The impetus for orchestral (non-vocal) music, likely grew out of the need for instrumental interludes between scenes (arias). By the way: such a band would typically backed by a \u2018continuo\u2019 of harpsichord. But over time, the string writing became more contrapuntal/polyphonic and the harpsichord as \u2018rhythm section\u2019 became superfluous and drops away, although harpsichords are still heard in some pieces as optional (vestigial) up until the late 1700\u2019s. Anyhoo, gradually, those instrumental interludes, grew into self-sustaining pieces, where an instrument would take the melodic place of a voice. And those became known as \u2018concertos\u2019. Eg. an \u2018oboe concerto\u2019 would be a self-contained instrumental piece with the oboe taking the place of a singer. A wordless \u2018aria\u2019. This is around 1700 or so\u2026. think Bach, Vivaldi and Handel. Although to give you some perspective, such a band in Bach\u2019s time might have as few as twelve players. In any case, once you have audiences used to the idea of listening to instrumental concertos (\u2026er\u2026 concerti) you\u2019re pretty much at the modern idea of an \u2018orchestra\u2019\u2026 a large band with strings/winds/brass playing multi-movement instrumental compositions. But a \u2018symphony\u2019, ie. a form of instrumental music in typically four movements, anchored by strings, finally comes together prox. 1750. The first true symphony writer that is still routinely performed is Haydn. It\u2019s not much of stretch to say that Haydn \u2018invented\u2019 the symphony orchestra, although his \u2018orchestra\u2019 would not have had more than 25 or so players. (Mainly, this is because you need at least 3 people on each string part to create the characteristic sound of a string orchestra.) But the modern orchestra, that most non-specialists envision, came about in the 1830\u2019s with the works of the first true \u2018romantics\u2019. It\u2019s then that you have what we think of as an \u2018orchestra\u2019\u2026 70\u2013100 players\u2026 that can do a piece by Berlioz. That\u2019s 20\u201332 violins, 12 violas, 12 celli, 8 basses, a dozen brass, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "This is the subject of many long monographs and dissertations. The simplest way I can explain it is that there were times when rich people (like nobility or royalty) liked having large ensembles playing music for them. It was glorious. The largest ensembles in early history have been for royalty. H\u00e4ndel, in 1749, wrote for an unusually large wind band, for King George II; Lully, in the 1680s, had orchestras with something like 35 string instruments, rather large for that time (Bach would\u2019ve only just been born). Inspiration was simply grandeur, as spurred by royalty. Large ensembles were thus born in the court, which became popular among the nobility and anyone else who could afford to attend performances with orchestras in them. Orchestras stayed largely among the upper class for a long time, until the mid-late 18th century. Simply put, large projects only exist where there is money. Music is no different from projects in art, architecture, etc. Where there is a large palace (e.g. Versailles), there is some measure of similarity in music (e.g. Lully, Rameau). ",
