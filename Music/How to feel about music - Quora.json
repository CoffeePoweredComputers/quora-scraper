            "answer_text": "What do you think music is? I think music is a form of artistic expression that serves to communicate what words alone have a hard time with. It\u2019s a memory tool, it\u2019s a means of understanding someone, it is something that touches the hearts of many, and can save lives. What feeling do you get when you listen to music? It depends on the song. Sometimes I listen to music to distract myself, or to get in touch with a specific feeling. When I\u2019m angry, I listen to the most aggressive stuff I have. When I\u2019m sad, I listen to music that will probably make me cry, and transition into more upbeat stuff. I can feel anything I want, and I love it. Do you think music can affect your emotions? Why? I know that music affects my emotions. I know that I can use it to cheer me up, or make me think, or even to inspire me. When I was bullied I used it to empower myself or to help me feel better. I had songs I identified with and those songs helped me through the toughest days. There\u2019s a lot of ways music can affect me, and I\u2019m glad it has that ability. I\u2019m glad I know how to use it to help me out. ",

            "answer_text": "I grew up listening to all kinds of music. From the fifties to present day but I really like the music from the 60\u2019s, 70\u2019s, 80\u2019s and some 90\u2019s. I really got into The Beatles and their music. I started to listen to their records, in my room, when I was 13. I was in Beatles heaven. Their music was my muse for writing poems and stories. They made me feel so happy. I was always depressed but they were my hope, dream and inspiration. I lived in a fantasy world and The Beatles were my best friends! I wish I could have met them or seen them in concert. But we still have Paul and Ringo. The Beatles will never die! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! ",
