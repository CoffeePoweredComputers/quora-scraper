            "answer_text": "It's hard to get people on Quora to admit it, but Elton John owned the 1970s pop music scene. Not sure about the number ones, but he had huge hits from almost all of his first 8 or 9 albums. Elton John came on the scene when FM radio was becoming very popular. There was not a lot of advertising, and they could play longer tracks, even entire albums. FM could play a great variety without alienating listeners, and engaging them in higher quality rock and roll. But Elton was a draw on both FM and AM. I think focusing on his number ones is an oversite. Madman Across the Water is one of my favorites songs, and I feel certain it was not even a hit. The guys I hung out with were much more likely to discuss and compare his albums rather than the hits. There are many magical moments on Goodbye Yellow Brick Road hidden in the later tracks. So maybe I'm trying to say that Elton John's music deserves a deep listening, the way people take apart a Beatle, or Pink Floyd LP. His voice was a power house, and for a while he was amazing as a composer and performer. So, go deeper than the hits. ",
