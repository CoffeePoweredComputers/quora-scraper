            "answer_text": "Lose Yourself is one of the best songs Ive heard and is a definite pick in any top 10 hip-hop songs list. But why is it so popular and critically acclaimed? The most important reason is its raw,powerful and aggressive lyrics Its opening lines are very easily recognizable and relatable. \u201cLook, if you had, one shot, or one opportunityTo seize everything you ever wanted. In one momentWould you capture it, or just let it slip?Yo\u201d The song progresses to a raw,emotional journey and we start experiencing the song from Eminem's perspective. \u201cI've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stageBut I kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypherBest believe somebody's paying the Pied PiperAll the pain inside amplified by theFact that I can't get by with my 9 to 5And I can't provide the right type of life for my family'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapersAnd it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life\u201d Frankly, the third verse is when the song hits its full potenial. At this point you cant help it but respect and admire Eminem for his realness,sincerity and perseverance. Another important reason why many people love the song is because of its technical brilliance. Eminem's ability to create multisyllabic rhymes out of nowhere is just mind boggling. Lets take a closer look at the first verse:  He just seems adamant in rhyming every single word he can.But even when he does so, he manages to do it with precise meaning and it doesnt sound corny. The song fits in perfectly with the semi-autobiographical movie 8-mile(directed by Eminem) which is a masterpiece as well. Lose yourself is the only rap song to win an Academy Award for Best original song.(2003) Among other accolades recieved were: 1.) Grammy for best rap song and best solo performance(2004) 2.) In 2004, it was one of only three hip hop songs from the 21st century to have been included on Rolling Stone's list of the \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\", and was also the highest ranking, at number 166. 3.)Quintiple Platinum certification 4.)It was ranked number 93 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs list. 5.) In October 2011, NME placed it at number 57 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\". 6.)With a 12-week run at #1 on the Hot 100, this song is the most commercially successful Oscar-winning tune. It also has a great music video with scenes from 8-mile depicting B-rabbit's(portrayed by Eminem) struggles in his hometown-the difficulties he has to face while rapping, the insult and booing of crowds as he is a white rapper and the trouble he has to face due to his alcoholic mother and people he hangs out with. Its been almost 15 years since the song came out but its legacy lives on. It has been used as a pump-up/motivational song countless number of times in many sporting events. It is simply one of the most inspiring songs ever made. ",

            "answer_text": "Facts about Eminem - \u201cLose Yourself\u201d: This was featured in Eminem's first movie, 8 Mile. The movie is based on Eminem's life; he grew up in a poor Detroit neighborhood and followed his dream of rap stardom. The movie got very good reviews as Eminem turned out to be a surprisingly good actor.On the movie set, Eminem had a trailer where he could record songs for the movie during breaks in filming. He wrote this in character as B. Rabbit, who he played in 8 Mile. Writing in character was nothing new for Eminem, as he had previously written songs as his alter ego, Slim Shady.The track had been around for over a year before Eminem pulled it off a CD and decided to work off the beat. He had his musicians mold the beat around his vocals.This song is highly produced and heavily layered. In addition to several vocal tracks, there are horns, woodwinds, strings, keyboards, drums, and sound effects all over the track.When the movie studio released the first trailers, this song did not exist, so they used \"Cleanin' Out My Closet,\" which the studio wanted to feature in the movie. Eminem thought that song was too personal for the movie, which was one reason he was so determined to write something that fit the character.The 8 Mile soundtrack was part of a very successful run for Eminem. While overall album sales were declining due to high CD prices and Internet piracy, this soundtrack and Eminem's album The Eminem Show were selling millions of copies. Rapper 50 Cent, who also appeared on the soundtrack, was the next big music success story. He also sold millions of albums after signing a deal with Eminem and Dr. Dre's Shady/Aftermath Records and releasing Get Rich or Die Tryin'.Eminem performed this at the 2003 Grammy Awards with The Roots backing him up. He won the Best Rap Album award that year for The Eminem Show. It was the only rap or R&B award presented during the telecast, as the other awards in those categories were given out before they went on the air. This didn't go over well in the rap community, especially since the award for Best Comedy Album (won by Robin Williams) was given out during the show.This won an Oscar for Best Song From A Movie, beating out songs by Paul Simon and U2. It was a bold choice for the academy, who usually pick fairly tame songs by Randy Newman, Sting, or Elton John. Barbra Streisand announced the award, and seemed surprised and happy that Eminem won.Eminem did not perform at the Oscars because they wanted him to sing the \"radio friendly\" version and he wanted to sing the song as written and let the censors edit the language. This was the first winning song not performed on The Oscars since it has been televised. (thanks, Jenny - Sussex, NJ)Unlike most rap songs, this uses a guitar playing power chords. (thanks, Remus - Algonquin, IL)The line, \"Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper\" is a reference to traditional German story The Pied Piper of Hamelin. The piper was hired to help the village with their rat problem. When they didn't pay, he left with the town's children.Mekhi Phifer, who is mentioned in the lyrics, is an actor who starred with Eminem in the movie 8 Mile. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France, for above 2)Weird Al Yankovic did a parody of this called \"Couch Potato\" on his album Poodle Hat, his first album in 4 years. Eminem let him do the song, but wouldn't let Weird Al make a video for it or release it as a single because he was worried about his image. Al thought this was odd considering how much Eminem makes fun of people in his videos. The parody makes fun of people who watch too much TV.This won a Grammy for Best Rap Song of 2003.With a 12-week run at #1 on the Hot 100, this song is the most commercially successful Oscar-winning tune.The lyrical work on \u201cLose Yourself\u201d has been praised by many due to it\u2019s flow and amazing and complex rhyming schemes. The lyrics applies to anything, any situation and any struggle in your life. So keep it engraved on your minds and never let it go. Successful people are those who set their minds to a goal and worked towards it day and night. Mind is the most powerful tool in this world and make use of it. Surely, the best rap song ever. You rock, Eminem. Bows Down. Respect. Song Review and Lyrics Meaning: Eminem - \"Lose Yourself\" (Lyrics Review & Song Meaning) - Just Random Things Video:  ",
