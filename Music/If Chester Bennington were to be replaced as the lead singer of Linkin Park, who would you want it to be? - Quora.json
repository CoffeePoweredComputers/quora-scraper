            "answer_text": "No one. No one can be replaced, especially someone like Chester. I hate how casually people think that you can just \u201creplace\u201d a person, it's just discusts me. It's like saying, \u201coh..you lost your brother? Well just replace him.\u201d You cannot replace people or any other living thing. Once they are gone, that's it, it is finite. All that is left behind is your memories. That's why you cherish those memories. If you are an actual fan of Linkin Park's then really think about your question. How can you even think of anyone singing his songs? Let alone replace him in the band. Anyone else singing his songs would just sound soo wrong \u2026 grating against the skin, like nails on a chalk board would be to hear anyone else trying to be him \u2026 they would undoubtedly suck, even if they are a good singer. No one will ever be as good as Chester was at singing Linkin Park songs. I know I would be waiting for Chester's scream to come in to the song and anyone else's would just feel so fucking wrong. No one out there sounds anything like Chester did. He is unique, one of a kind, a true rock legend. Linkin Park is never going to replace Chester and carry on like nothing happened. They might do some collaborative work with some other artist, but they are never ever gonna replace him. People, please stop asking this type of question. It is rude and insensitive. Plus I know I've answered it at least 5 times in different forms. My answer is never gonna change about this. Linkin Park is never going to even try to replace the heart of their band. If you follow Mike Shindoa on Youtube or Instagram, ect.. you would know this too. \u2026. Ok maybe @Malcolm Minchin is on to something, Barbara might be a lovely addition to Linkin Park \u2026 it would certainly bring in a different fan base for sure. ;) ",
