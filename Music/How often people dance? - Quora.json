            "answer_text": "How often, well that depends on the circumstances, and how things are going in their life. Like for instance when I got into a new relation The first day I woke up at 4. AM and I was dancing alone in my room. yea, sounds pretty idiotic and crazy but it\u2019s true. And coming onto others, anyone can dance at anytime. Dance is not just \u2018dance\u2019 it\u2019s a Stress Buster. You can always relax yourself by doing a few moves on your favorite songs. Some people just don\u2019t like dance or feel awkward to dance even with their friends and it\u2019s totally cool to feel that way. Not everyone loves to dance, some sit in solitude, some workout, some listen to music, and some dance. I love dancing too but haven\u2019t shaken the leg for a while. But from now on, I think i\u2019ll be dancing more. People dance with their set frequency nothing more, nothing less. ",
