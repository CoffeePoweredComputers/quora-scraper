            "answer_text": "I am going to give you, what I think, is a detailed answer based on what I have read and on my own experience as a person who doesn\u2019t like to dance. I invite you to read my answer at your own pace and when you\u2019re not busy, because it is long and because I also put a lot of thought into it, or at least I hope. First, I would like to make a distinction. When I say I don\u2019t like dancing, I mean I don\u2019t like to dance. I actually like, and understand, and respect, the art of dancing. I like to see professional dancers. So, with that said, let\u2019s go ahead with the why some people don\u2019t like dancing question. It makes complete sense that you should dance, even from a scientific point of view. In addition to hypotheses (that we dance because it is in our genes, because our ancestors also danced, etc), there have been scientific studies showing that \u201cwe engage in social dance as part of a courtship display and furthermore that the way we dance in social settings is influenced by our hormonal and genetic make up. According to this view we dance in part to communicate our genetic \"fitness\" to be a reproductive partner and as such there might be reproductive, hormonal and genetic reasons why we do or don't dance.\u201d In other words, if we want to find a partner, science says that we\u2019ll have an easier time to get one if we dance. In addition, some people, those lucky ones who like dancing, do so because it makes them feel complete, relaxed, alive. They also enjoy the interaction with their friends and partners. There are many, many other reasons as to why people like to dance, but let\u2019s keep the list short. Socially speaking, you also should dance because people will feel more attracted to you; it makes you more likeable (I know it shouldn\u2019t be that way, but it is). In fact, people who don\u2019t like dancing are seen as boring, serious, grumpy\u2026 they are the party poopers. Of course, nothing can be farther from the truth. Put that lonely guy, the one with his arms crossed in the dark corner watching other people dance, put him in any other context and chances are he will make you laugh your ass off. It always surprises me how someone who was perceived as really funny and charismatic a moment ago, you know, that really funny guy with whom you spent an hour talking, goes from a really funny, charismatic guy, to a completely boring, down to earth serious guy when the music starts playing and he just doesn\u2019t want to join along. Given the importance people put in dancing nowadays (and how they judge those who just won\u2019t move their body), the activity has become another social skill that people need in order to not being isolated (again, it shouldn\u2019t be that way, but it seems that\u2019s where we are headed. Everyone who has been judged, likely negative, because of their hesitance to dance, can see where I am coming from), it is almost as important as manners, body language, humor, and courtesy. So, with so many benefits dancing has: helping you find a partner, being socially accepted, give you a good work out, etc., why some people, including me, will just not dance? The answer is simple, and I will answer it starting with asking a rhetorical question (my college professors would be so disappointed!). Why don\u2019t some people like singing out loud in public? It has many benefits. Why don\u2019t some people like working out\u201d Again, many benefits. Why don\u2019t some people like to watch sports? After all, sports have bonding and positive psychological effects in individuals. Whatever the reasons for people not liking to engage in those activities, they are similar to the reasons why some people don\u2019t like to dance. So now, I will finally share my personal answer. In short, I don\u2019t like to dance, and it has nothing to do with what other people have already written: that I am shy, or that I\u2019m worried about what others think of me. In my case, is that I just don\u2019t \u201cFeel it\u201d. I don\u2019t feel the desire, the passion to move my body at the sound of any music. I have tried with different kinds of music: country, jazz, disco, latin american, indian, chinese, etc, and they do not make me want to move my body. That does not mean I am immune to music. Heck no. Music (certain types, specially videogames or instrumental, celtic music) makes me feel different types of emotions: sadness, joy, nostalgia, happiness, adrenaline, fear. I love it when a track is so good my heart races and beats at the track\u2019s rhythm, or when a track is so powerfully intense and emotional that I get goosebumps. That\u2019s what I love, that\u2019s what music makes me feel. Music makes me feel emotions, in puts my brain in ecstasy, not my body. People who say they don\u2019t dance because they don\u2019t \u201cfeel it\u201d have a very valid reason not to dance. Just think about it. If I don\u2019t feel the music (in dancing, not listening terms), and still I suck it up and try to dance, it is bound to feel forced. Have you ever tried to do anything when you don\u2019t feel it? Like, singing, writing, playing a video game, sex even (yes, even sex can suck when you are not in the mood) Whatever it is, if you force it, it will feel dull, dry, and awkward. And you can notice it, you are aware of it. Imagine writing a poem, or a story, when you\u2019re not a writer nor a poet, and then you are asked to read that piece out loud, how would you feel? And, if you say no, should people call you boring, antisocial or a party pooper? Well then, that is an approximation of how people who don\u2019t like to dance feel like and are perceived as. As I said before, I believe knowing how to dance has become a social skill, and I am committed to learn it. Yes, I do not like dancing, but I will learn how to. It is not for peer pressure. It is different. Peer pressure is when someone actively makes you do something you don\u2019t want to. In my case, thank God, no one neither makes fun of me, nor threatens me, nor physically forces me to dance. I am going to learn for the same reason I learned good manners, good body language, and how to keep a positive attitude and how to be funny, because I want to improve my social life. In my case, I would use dancing as means to get something, and I believe many people do so even if they do not realize it. It is my belief that those who really, really enjoy music inherently, those who don\u2019t do it to get laid, recognition, be popular, or to be accepted, are the ones who don\u2019t only dance in their house, alone, but who get lost doing it. They are the only ones who dance for dancing\u2019s sake and not to get the previously mentioned social and health benefits. To summarize, some people don\u2019t like to dance because they don\u2019t \u201cfeel it\u201d, and if they are forced to dance, they don\u2019t like it because they have no idea of what they\u2019re doing and feel awkward about it. Non-dancers still enjoy music as much, if not more, than dancers. They feel intense emotions and get inspired from music. The only minor, minuscule difference is that we, non-dancers, were born without that switch that should turn on the moment music starts playing and that would make us want to move our bodies gracefully and harmoniously and thus feel alive.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t like dancing either. In fact I think I have only danced three times in my life (in 1975, 1980 and 1996) and I was very drunk all three times. I don't enjoy dancing and, am very suspicious of men who do. I remember my father saying to me: \"dancing is for women, children, homosexuals and black people on the basis that they are the only people any good at it\". Dancing is ridiculous and you look ridiculous doing it (watch people dancing on TV with the sound turned off) unless you are very, very well trained. Dancing is, fundamentally, about showing off and there is nothing worse than a show off! Dancing in the mid-seventies, when I was a teenager, seemed to involve gently jiggling up and down with your arms bent and your hands held up at shoulder level. Then came Saturday Night Fever which encouraged show offs all over the planet and, from then on, made dancing, particularly for men, an embarrassing minefield and a subject that made impressing cruelly critical women even more difficult. I couldn't then (as I still can't) understand why holding yourself up to public ridicule (which is what dancing is) is supposed to be fun; it is totally ghastly. You probably worry about what people think of you when dancing. Good dancers say \u201cdon\u2019t worry no-one is looking at you\u201d. But, actually, they are and they are all making critical comments. Would you stand up in public and start playing the trumpet if you have never played one before? Of course not! But that is what taking to the dance floor is like, if you have had no training or possess no natural ability. It is often said (usually by people on shows like Dancing with the Stars and Strictly Come Dancing, for example) that anyone can dance but I actually don't agree with this. I think dancing is an innate ability, like being musical (the two are not linked - I am very musical), having ability in languages, being good at maths or drawing. While you can improve a little through teaching, if you don't have that basic ability nothing that anyone does for you can help. It is best just to acknowledge your limitations, therefore! If you don\u2019t enjoy something you should not do it! Well done to you for not being dragged into this ridiculous, juvenile practice! ",
