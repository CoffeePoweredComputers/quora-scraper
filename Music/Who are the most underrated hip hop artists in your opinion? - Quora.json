            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re underrated exactly, but they have definitely been forgotten by the masses to say the least. One of my two favorite artists are Oynx and Mobb Deep, two 90s groups from New York. Both of them released their debut album in 1993, with \u201cBacdafucup\u201d and \u201cJuvenile Hell\u201d respectively. In my opinion, Bacdafucup combines hard hitting lyricism and shouting with some witty wordplay and even a little crude humor. It\u2019s definetely some of the most hardcore stuff I\u2019ve heard to date, and it only gets more real as you listen to it. However, I will say that their cadence is quite unique and thus it may be a little difficult to decipher what they\u2019re saying. Mobb Deep is more famous for their second album \u201cThe Infamous\u201d in 1995, particularly the songs \u201cShook Ones Part II\u201d and \u201cSurvival of the Fittest\u201d. I will say that Mobb Deep is still revered with the same reverence of maybe Run-DMC or A Tribe Called Quest, but probably not at much as Wu-Tang. Mobb Deep has some of the most memorable instrumentals and bars in hip-hop as a whole, and though they are considered to be spectacular in the ears of an old school hip-hop fan, they have been forgotten and are underrated in the genre overall. I don\u2019t know if you already know about these groups or not, but i personally think their music should be frequented as much as 2Pac or Eminem. Post Script: I would like to mention that I am only 16, and thus obviously was not around to witness the frenzy that likely surrounded the release of these albums. Also note that both groups\u2019 music was used in the movie \u201c8 Mile\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Justin Warfield - creates an unbelievable psychedelic hip hop album back in the nineties. Aesop Rock - not that underrated, he gets his dues, but really he should receive far more recognition than he currently does - though I doubt he\u2019d want it. FLANCH - more contemporary, but they deserve a lot more attention. If you like the industrial/experimental side of things and want to listen to a group who absconded from a Christian cult in order to make hip hop about AI then\u2026well this is your only option if your interests happen to be that specific. Sean Price - sadly passed away. Big in underground circles but never reached his true height, despite his ridiculous level of skill. If you enjoy aggressive flow and delivery this is your guy. Oddly enough I\u2019d actually recommend his latest offering Imperius Rex as a jumping off point. Busdriver - flow beyond description, almost as though he expects the beat to catch up with him - in no way a criticism. His use of language an metaphors and tongue twisters is something to behold. Perfect Hair is one of his best. The Buttress - incredible contemporary rapper. She can match anybody out today in terms of technique - not to mention aggression. You can feel how angry she is at the world, and she gets it across with imagery that would make Eminem wince. ",
