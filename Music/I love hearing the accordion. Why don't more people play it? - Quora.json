            "answer_text": "I love hearing the accordion. Why don\u2019t more people play it? Because more people don\u2019t play it.Or, to be less facetious, because it isn\u2019t taught. If more people played it, then more people would teach it, and it would spread. I\u2019ve known one person who played, and one other person who owned an accordion but didn\u2019t play, in my entire life. Until that day when accordions ascend to their proper place at the pinnacle of musical instruments, we\u2019ll just have to settle for listening to Weird Al Yankovic over and over and over and over again.

I don\u2019t play it because the class of accordion playing my mother signed me up for was canceled I enjoyed playing a toy accordion. That\u2019s why she signed me up, but before I tried finding another class, I lost my desire to learn it. Sorry, but I don\u2019t enjoy the sound as much as you. The bagpipes are what stir my blood, but I think the guitar is my favorite for long-term listening. To answer your question, I don\u2019t know for sure, but I get the idea that most people don\u2019t enjoy the sound as much as other instruments. ",
