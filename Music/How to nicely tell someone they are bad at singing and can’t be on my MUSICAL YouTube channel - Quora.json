            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a reason why people enjoy Simon Cowell on those TV talent shows. He is direct and truthful, and you know he\u2019s being straight with you. Feelings get hurt, sure \u2026 but, you\u2019re actually doing someone a favor by telling them they are not ready for prime time if they are not cut out to be a singer. Show business is cruel to people who actually have talent. But it can be awful to the mediocre. There are countless scams and scammers who are more than willing to take money for lessons, or representation, or photos, or wardrobe, or \u201cconsulting\u201d fees \u2026 the list goes on. Not to mention hecklers and trolls. Then there is the mathematics of the situation: for every decent gig that actually pays enough to make it worth doing, there are about 5,000 people vying for it. If you want any level of success in the music business you need plenty of talent, a sincere work ethic, unending persistence, and a heck of a tolerance for insults, dismissive jerks and unappreciative audiences. It\u2019s a tough road that\u2019s littered with talented people who got spit out along the way. If it turns out that you\u2019ve got what it takes, it can be greatly rewarding to be onstage in front of thousands of cheering fans. But it doesn\u2019t work out that way for many people. You could be saving someone a lot of heartache (and probably a lot of money) by advising them to get out of a race they can\u2019t win. Also, be aware that everyone\u2019s a critic, and you could be wrong. But taking criticism is part of being a singer. There aren\u2019t any stars who are beloved by absolutely everyone. Even the biggest stars are hated by a few. If someone wants to be a singer - then they should expect to be criticized. The best thing you can do is to be straight with them. Make sure it\u2019s not personal. Be kind, be fair, but don\u2019t deny the obvious. Who knows? They may work so hard to prove you wrong, that they actually develop their talent. ",

            "answer_text": "I find in this day and age (I'm not an old bugger yet either, 25 years young) people are terrified of 2 things; Confrontation Criticism Honestly if they are bad tell them they are and need to practice, there clearly aren't enough people in their life telling them the truth and you are being one of them. If I screw something up or do something badly I try to be self critical of it within reason e.g not nitpicking tiny details and I accept the same criticism from my peers as I know all they are trying to do is help me get better. Most people are mature enough (or should be) to understand a lot of the time we give these opinions because we care about them not jumping the gun and posting something easily mockable or in some cases unremarkable online. Also if they are stubborn about it let them be, with more people eventually telling them they aren't as good as they think they WILL have to take note someday. Some people are just like that. I hope you're a decent enough person to give them the truth even if it hurts. ",

We're all terrible at the things we're passionate about when we first start. Don't knock them down. That's just being mean for no reason. It's your channel, you get to choose the content. Tell them, \"It's nothing personal, you're just giving me content I'm not looking for right now. I'll let you know when I can use you and your talent,\" and thank them for offering to contribute. Making them feel good in this context opens up a dialogue and relationship. You won't burn any bridges. Maybe a year (or few years) from now, they will have taken lessons and become incredible. ",

You wouldn\u2019t be in this position if she hadn\u2019t said that. Instead of telling her that she\u2019s a terrible singer, you can say that you\u2019d rather stick to singing solo while you start out. You can also suggest that she make her own channel to \u201cshow off [her] talent.\u201d The ruthless and usually overly mean critics will tell her the truth. ",
