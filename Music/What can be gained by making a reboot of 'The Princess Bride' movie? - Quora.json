            "answer_text": " A remake of \u201cThe Princess Bride\u201d, \"inconceivable\"\u2026 The Princess Bride is a 1987 American fantasy adventure comedy film directed and co-produced by Rob Reiner, starring Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin, Chris Sarandon, Wallace Shawn, Andr\u00e9 the Giant and Christopher Guest. Adapted by William Goldman from his 1973 novel The Princess Bride. One of the few movies where they did just about everything right, for once. The author of the book wrote the screenplay. Rob Reiner, from \u2018All in the Family\u2019, was director, and a perfect cast, like Robin Wright as Buttercup, Andre the Giant as Fezzik (a giant), Wallace Shawn as Vizzini, a mastermind criminal bully. Peter Falk as Grandpa/The Narrator. Fred Savage as The Grandson. Nothing can be gained by making a reboot of \"The Princess Bride\" movie, except maybe making more money, But I doubt it will do as well as the original, so it would just be a terrible waste of their time and money.

            "answer_text": "Is some idiot really imagining that a remake of Princess Bride is possible or desirable? What a waste of money \u2014 like the remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, with Johnny Depp replacing Gene Wilder. Nobody wanted it, and almost everybody thinks of the Gene Wilder version as the \u201creal\u201d one. Even if some wonderful current actors are in a new Princess Bride, it won\u2019t help. Nothing will make us forget the splendid casting and acting in William Goldman\u2019s script and story. Some remakes work \u2014 but only if they make large changes. Shop Around the Corner was a wonderful movie; You\u2019ve Got Mail was a remake, but it was a completely new, updated script, so that you can watch the two movies back to back and enjoy both parts of the double feature. The one doesn\u2019t REPLACE the other; it\u2019s merely an echo, with much new material to delight us. But Princess Bride just does NOT need a reenvisioning. The delicate balance of humor and romance in Princess Bride is perfect, and any changes are likely to be fatal. Even a parody would probably not work \u2014 Rebel Wilson as Buttercup would have her delights for us, but it would wear thin long before the movie ended. Since Princess Bride IS a satire, satirizing it would be absurd. The movie exists. It is perfect as it stands. Even its flaws are part of its perfection. I hope they leave it alone. If they actually make such a badly conceived project, I won\u2019t be attending it. Because life is short. ",
