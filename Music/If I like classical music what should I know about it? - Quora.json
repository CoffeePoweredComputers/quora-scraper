            "answer_text": "Listen. Lots. Try composers from different eras and styles. You\u2019ll like some of it, hate some of it, and feel \u201cmeh\u201d about others. Pretty soon, you\u2019ll figure out what composers you like and want to delve further into. FWIW, I started getting into classical when I was about 12 and my parents got me a record (yes, I\u2019m that old, an actual LP) of Rimsky-Korsakov\u2019s \u201cScheherazade.\u201d And I was amazed to find out that not only was it beautiful music, it told a story \u2014 without words! A lot of years later: I have a huge collection of classical music. Plus, I\u2019ve studied classical flute and piano, and while I\u2019m nowhere near good enough to be a professional musician or anything, it\u2019s given me another lens into how music is structured. An interesting side note: I have a friend who is a college professor of music theory. She\u2019s forgotten more about music than I\u2019ll ever know. Anyhow, we were talking about musical taste, and I said that I liked music from very different composers, from different eras, and disliked others, but could never figure out what the commonality was between the ones I liked. So she asked me for some examples. I said some of my favorites were J. S. Bach, a lot of Renaissance composers (Tallis, Palestrina, Susato, and Praetorius, especially)\u2026 and Shostakovich and Prokofiev. She smiled. \u201cI bet you don\u2019t like Mozart much,\u201d she said. \u201cNot really. I like a few pieces, but most of it\u2019s pleasant background music and not much more, in my opinion. But how did you know that?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s rhythm,\u201d she said. \u201cYou like odd cross rhythms and interesting unexpected chord progressions. That\u2019s what\u2019s common to all of the ones you like. Mozart, for all of his genius at composing beautiful melodies, didn\u2019t rely on surprising rhythms or odd chords very much. But I\u2019ll make you a bet, okay?\u201d I asked her what. She said, \u201cListen to the first movement of Mozart\u2019s 25th Symphony. I bet you lunch that you\u2019ll love it.\u201d I ended up buying her lunch. Take a listen.  ",

            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t need to know anything about it. Just enjoy the music - that is what it\u2019s for. But as you hear more, you\u2019ll inevitably learn more about it - who you like, who you don\u2019t, the history, the instrumentation. I think knowing something about it enhances the music in some ways, because every piece has some little bit of history (or at least a story) behind it, and fits into a bigger picture to varying degrees. But you\u2019ll pick it up. If you happen to live in Australia, or can access it via the web, ABC Classic FM is a great station for learning about classical music, because they explain a lot about what they play, and have programs such as \u2018Keys To Music\u2019, which is perfect for the average person who wants to learn more. You could also try BBC Radio 3. I also recommend going to live concerts - it\u2019s a completely different experience than listening to a recording, no matter how good your sound equipment. For example, the first time I heard Saint-Sa\u00ebns 3rd symphony played on a really enormous orchestral organ (at the Albert Hall), it was like being allowed a glimpse of another dimension - even recalling the experience 25 years later makes the hairs on my neck stand up!
