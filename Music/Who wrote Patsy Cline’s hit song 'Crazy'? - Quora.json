Charlie thought it would be a great song for Patsy suggested Willie show ther the song. Willie was reluctant to say the least, considering Patsy was known to have quite a temper. Charlie drove Willie to their home, and Willie protested. He said \u201cwhat happens if she don\u2019t like it? We\u2019ll be lucky to get out alive.\u201d Well it took a little persuasion, but Willie finally showed her the song, and the rest is history. ",
