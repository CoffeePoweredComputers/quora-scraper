            "answer_text": "Honestly I don\u2019t know. Many kpop fans are doing this and we are being known for it, and I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so common, or why people do it so much. To promote their idols I guess. However, when someone passes, it\u2019s not appropriate to do that. Many people are just putting the fancams on everything, and it can be very disrespectful depending on what the original post was about. I am on twitter but pretty much for only official kpop updates, as well as minecraft. So, I usually don\u2019t see the arguements/toxicness that\u2019s supposedly there. Although, kpoppers are posting a TON under the #whiteIivesmatter, and some people have thanked them for it because they have been drowning it out. I hope we can continue to use our power correct ways, not saying \u201cWell if he stanned idol then maybe he wouldn\u2019t have been hurt,\u201d with fancams. I hope the immature fans can realize what\u2019s appropriate and when. I don\u2019t know, join some discord servers that are for kpop if you wanna talk that bad. I also hope more outsiders see the good fans, (usually older or multistans), and less of the bad ones. Everyone thinks that we\u2019re all toxic since there\u2019s a few who are. I just wanna be seen as a regular fan, just like of webtoons and certain youtubers. But to actually answer your question, I don\u2019t really know. I think it\u2019s fair to assume it\u2019s to promote their idol(s), but they need to realize when it\u2019s appropriate. Hope this helps! -Rey ",
