            "answer_text": "This answer may be a little long but I\u2019ll explain the reasons why I think they\u2019re the best comebacks and pictures hehe; also, I\u2019m just talking about my opinion but I also took in count general public\u2019s opinion based on what I\u2019ve seen around the web. Of course there have been more comebacks that were really good but these are the one that stood out for me. EXO  They have the most intriguing, never-seen-before concept of all year! Evil clones fighting with real EXO and the most amazing part is that everything in the story line is connected since many comebacks ago and probably since their debut; so watching this unfold is really awesome!The title track is BOMB. It\u2019s catchy, it fits well with the concept and is full of little details (ex. the bg vocals is like the clones and the real ones were arguing) Vocals are outstanding as always, really well mixed together and the rap parts are amazing. Everything delivered in the legend level they\u2019re on.The side tracks of the album are all different genders and they managed to pull off every single one of them, which is really hard to do. There\u2019s not a bad song in this album and also, the line distribution is better since every member got a time to shine resulting in the song sounding varied in a good way and well-balanced too.2. MAMAMOO   Mamamoo on its own is already a very, very unique group and I think that shows in this comeback because their concept (even though at first glance on the video looks like it\u2019s just another girl-crush type of thing) it\u2019s actually really original. This comeback shows 4 different alternate universes that show us the girls\u2019 lives if they weren\u2019t kpop-artists and I think that\u2019s really cool.I loved how they addressed real issues on the video, like the part when Hwasa was at a press conference with the headline of having caused controversia for an airport outfit, it was very sassy and cool since she dealt with it in real life & it showed how she doesn\u2019t let what others think of her affect her life.The song is sassy, flirty but powerful and really catchy, also the lyrics are amazing, telling everyone to be themselves no matter what others\u2019 opinion is and telling every hater to mind their own business. #QUEENSVocals are gorgeous.3. TWICE   I don\u2019t stan TWICE but this comeback made me wanna. \u201cFancy\u201d was something different to what they had experienced before, at least visually since the song is also very cute as their previous hits but the beat in this song is specially good. The song is catchy and perfect to bring an upbeat mood.I was close to list BLACKPINK\u2019s comeback but to be honest it was a little bit disappointing since there wasn\u2019t something special or new about it and even though it was high-budget and the girls looked amazing, the beat and the coreography were pretty similar to what they\u2019ve been doing up until now. BTS\u2019s comeback was also good but nothing out of the world, the song was cool tho and really good to lift the mood since it\u2019s catchy and has a cheerful melody. ",

            "answer_text": "BTS\u2019s Boy with luv was a bop, like all o their other songs. It wasn\u2019t their best, in my opinion, but still really good! And Halsey! I love their friendship, it\u2019s so cute and the MV is so cute. And the army version is sooo cute and really show how much ARMY means to them.   TXT\u2019s Crown. It\u2019s their debut song so does it count as a comeback? Either way it may be one o my favorite\u2019s on this list because it\u2019s so fresh and cute and I fell in love with the members and the song and the group in my first listen.  Cat and Dog maybe is more of a comeback and also really good, although not among my favorites in their mini album. I hope they will release more awesome songs and that more people can appreciate them as their own group and not as BTS\u2019 cute little brother band.   Got7\u2019s Eclipse was also good but their Japanese release Love loop was even better in my opinion. I love GOT7, they have so much talent. STAN TALENT!   Stray kids\u2019 Side effects and MIROH, I haven\u2019t listen to these two that much cuz I like their other songs better but still awesome songs!  And their new album is sooooo good, I\u2019m obsessed with the mixtape (I know the mixtapes aren\u2019t new songs but they are still good)   Eric nam\u2019s Runaway, I heard his songs for the first time today and I have fallen in love. Again. Give him lot of support because he is so talented and have such good songs.   Astros\u2019 All night is truly amazing, the visuals AGHHH!!! No but as a new fan of them I have still not gotten over this song   I would also like to add Up10tion\u2019s Your gravity, it\u2019s such a bop!   ",
