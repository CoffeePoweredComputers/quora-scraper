            "answer_text": "I played long scale bass all my life, and I tried a short scale one not long ago. It was fun to play. Different, but fun! I still prefer the long scale, but I see nothing wrong with the short scale one. To answer your question, \u201cbetter\u201d is what suits you and your style. It\u2019s not a matter of long or short scale. It\u2019s a matter of what feels right for YOU. My advise: Go to a music shop and try both. See which one feels better. THe instrument will talk to you. And then, you can make a choice. But there\u2019s one thing to remember: It\u2019s also not a matter of being abeginner or a pro. It\u2019s about the instrument you choose. If you pick the short scale bass, be ready to master the short scale bass. Same with the long scale bass. Don\u2019t think for a minute: \u201cI\u2019ll start with the short scale and when I become a pro, I\u2019ll switch to the long scale\u201d. Music doesn\u2019t work like that. The difference between a beginner and a pro is not the instrument, but the \u201cmileage\u201d. You don\u2019t pick an instrument to discard it after a while. You pick an instrument to master it, and get it to the limit. I continue playing the first bass I bought. I modified it a lot, but it\u2019s still my good old first bass. ",

            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t have said so, per se. I started on a short scale bass (a Fender Mustang) way back in nineteen hundred and tiddlybonk, but sold it to buy a two pickup Ibanez bass. It was nice to play. I often wish I still had it. The only reasons I can think of for a short scale being better for a beginner are size/weight, but weight can depend on the kind of wood used in a bass, whatever scale. Neck width on a long scale bass might make a difference if you had small hands. I immediately thought of the amazing Tal Wilkenfeld , who looks quite small and dainty, but plays full size, long scale basses and does a pretty damn good job of it. Short scale basses can sound different, but aren\u2019t necessarily any easier to use. EDIT: Tal Wilkenfeld live (with full size bass) Jeff Beck & Tal Wilkenfeld. @ Crossroads Festival 2007 ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: Maybe. Longer answer: Short-scale (30\u2033) basses were developed so that guitarists who wanted to play bass could adapt more easily. For example, Gibson's EB series (EB-1, EB-0, EB-2, EB-3, etc.) all started out as short-scale, with full-scale (34\u2033) versions of some models available later. Fender's Precision and Jazz Bass were both full-scale, with the short-scale Mustang and Musicmaster basses coming later. If you want to learn proper bass technique, a full-scale bass is almost a necessity; the strings on short-scale models don't have as much string tension, which affects playing style. If you have REALLY small hands, a short-scale bass will work, but a full-scale is preferable. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what your playing goal is, both technically and tonally. Shorter scale basses have a weaker sound and shorter sustain than longer scale basses, which is fine if you like the tone of the short scale. But learning on a short scale bass will put you at a disadvantage whenever you decided to make the switch to a longer scale bass. I have witnessed this personally with someone I am teaching. She made the switch to a longer scale bass after practicing mainly with a short scale and she's still having trouble adjusting to the new scale length. I reccomend learning on a long scale and later if you prefer the tone of a short scale, then switch to that. Learning on a long scale will give you more technical flexibility. ",

An excellent beginner bass would be the Ibanez Mikro 24\u201d bass. It\u2019s cheap, small and has a killer tone! ",
