            "answer_text": "Before I say anything I first want to remind people just how hard it is being an idol in general. Not only is the training process intense and extreme, one\u2019s mental ability is also tested with the career of an idol. You have almost no freedom, constantly in the spotlight with every word and move zoomed in to make news, and you\u2019re constantly under the pressure of being \u2018perfect\u2019. So, regardless of whose fan you are please be respectful to all these boys and be mindful of your words. Regarding the question of who\u2019s better I hope to be as fair as possible considering I am fans of both groups. EXO was the group that introduced me to kpop and I will never forget the days where I would watch every video of theirs. Although I\u2019m not as deep in to them as before they still have such a special place in my heart and will always be legends in their own way to me. I started getting in to BTS around the wings era because they were starting to get a lot of attention internationally and I searched them up out of curiosity but since then haven\u2019t been able to leave. Both groups are talented af and hardworking af. They\u2019ve also had their share of struggles and hardships. In terms of vocals I have to admit that as a whole EXO takes it. Chen, Baekhyun and DO have very different styles of singing and ranges and all three have been very highly ranked in multiple vocal ranking lists. Even looking past the 3 main vocals, xiumin, Suho and Lay are also very vocally strong and more and more these days we get to hear Kai, chanyeol and Sehun\u2019s voices as well despite them being main dancers and rappers respectively. Of course, BTS has a very strong vocal line too with all 4 vocals having distinct voices that can easily be identified. However, in terms of stability, Jungkook and Jin is near the level of EXO vocal line but Tae and Jimin still needs some improving (although, they are getting more stable with every performance). Dance is the one that is the hardest to say who is better. Both teams have strong dancers and relatively weaker ones. Kai, Lay and Sehun are the dance line of EXO and again have 3 very different styles. Kai, in particular is named one of the best dancers of this kpop generation alongside people like Jimin and Jhope. EXO, as a whole is stable when dancing, due to their length of training and experience with even baekhyun, who is vocal, becoming lead dancer material. BTS, however, also have a great dance line. J-Hope is smooth, Jimin is classy and Jungkook is powerful. So I would say it\u2019s a tie in terms of dance. In terms of rap I have to give it to BTS. Chanyeol is a great rapper and Sehun is also stable but BTS\u2019 rap line are not idol rappers, they can be underground and full time rappers if they went down that route. Suga and RM in particular has been praised multiple times for their rap skills. In terms of producing it\u2019s also gunna be BTS for me purely for the fact that they are involved in almost every track. EXO also participates in the creation of their songs, but they are not as involved as BTS. I\u2019m not going to talk about concepts because that can be a whole other essay with both groups boasting some of the most fascinating and complicated concepts in kpop. In terms of visual, it is too relatively to say who is better. They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder and everyone has different opinions on beauty and looks. If we\u2019re talking about Korean beauty standards then EXO takes it. Chanyeol and Sehun are literally known as visual gods in Korea and the whole groups are said to be visuals. However, you can\u2019t deny the fact that V and Jungkook have both been selected as the most handsome men in the world so again, looks is a tie for me. Success wise, it is also difficult to compare. Undeniably, BTS is at the top of their game with selling out stadium tours to performing at top American TV shows and snagging awards in America alongside top artists. Of course there\u2019s also things like the UN speech and cover of times\u2026I can literally go on and on. But, we shouldn\u2019t forget about EXO\u2019a achievement at their peak. They are the first Korean artist to sell over one millions copies in 12 years, they won the daesang consecutively for 4 years, first kpop artist to be featured by the Dubai fountain and to sell quadruple million\u2026again the list could go on for them as well. I didn\u2019t want to do this category because struggles shouldn\u2019t be a competition but both groups have had their own share of hardships. For EXO, they had 3 members leave at the peak their career, had to go through 2 dating scandals and now have a member becoming a father, their company has mistreated them multiple times despite them being huge. Fans have said that although it seems like it, EXO never walked the flower path to success, there success was formed on a blood road. BTS came from a small company and everyone looked down on them. They were criticised on their looks and their music and have been accused of plagiarism. They have also been mistreated by the Korea media on multiple instances and they really made their way up with blood, sweat and tears. To sum up, both groups are legends of their own and have all made their own history. They will both become artists that will be remembered for a long time in the industry and they shouldn\u2019t be compared. I also want to point out that the two groups have very close relationships with eachother and have all made a point to avoid fanwars. I hope the fans will do the same too :) ",

            "answer_text": "Unbiased answer here: (I'm really bad at writing in english so sorry) Visuals: EXO. (Not a subjective answer) It's totally subjective but EXO and BTS are kpop groups and EXO fits korean beauty standards more. Anyway everyone has different taste so this answer is invalid. Vocals: EXO. EXO and SM are known to have the best vocals in Kpop and while some might like BTS's voice and call it unique their technique, vocal range, live vocals are pretty weak. And even rappers and dancers of EXO can easily compete with them. I would like to add that all EXO vocalists are on the list of best kpop vocalists (chen being the fifth best vocalist) while only V and jungkook being there and in the average section way below.  Rap: Suga. While as main tracks BTS wins because they're obviously a hip-hop group, when it comes down to how good the rappers actually are (based on solo activities and side tracks) Chanyeol is very underrated because people only judge him based on main tracks while he's actually as good as RM and Jhope. Suga is the only one that can beat him. That's why my answer is Suga not BTS. Dance: Kai. (Very long answer) Now when it comes to dance both groups have VERY different style. And since BTS\u2019s style is more edgy people who don't know anything about dance tend to think their choreography is harder while it's not. The only difference is that EXO\u2019s dance style is smooth. So it looks easy but believe me as a dancer I'm telling you it's not in anyway easy. Normally i would've said both. But since Kai exists I'm sorry but he's the winner. You've got to put in mind not what he usually does but how far he can go. And seeing that he's definitely better. Actually he's been voted by idols themselves as the best dancer in kpop for 3 years. The only competition he has is taemin. And everyone who looks at it without being biased knows that. Honourable mention is baekhyun. All of EXO are better dancers now than when they debuted but baekhyun deserve to be especially mentioned. He went from being called EXO\u2019s worst dancer to becoming a lead dancer in no time. And he got his own dance break recently. I think he deserve to be rewarded for his hard work that's why i mentioned him. MVs: both. Both groups MVs are amazing. P.s. it fascinates me how some people are comparing fake love to Mama in terms of production saying fake love was better when Mama was released in 2012 and fake love in 2018. Story behind MVs: EXO. Wait hold on. I know what you're gonna say. \u201cBTS are talking about mental health and serious problems so they are better!\u201d But hear me out. BTS\u2019s story is about mental health and such but that's it. It's complicated yes. But it's like reading a book. It's not mind blowing. EXO are a project SM has been working on since 2006 and lee soo man has been planing since a LONG time and their story is the most complicated thing I've ever seen. It might not seem like this from the outside but when you actually connect all the MVs together you'll understand how mind blowing it is. EXO's story depends on historical events and space ALOT. Many EXO comeback times are related to space. Anyway if you don't agree with me then i won't blame you but let me assure you. You will understand if you read about their story till now. ALL of it. Not just one or two MVs\u2019 theories. Fandom: EXO-Ls In terms of being the worst fandom: Though before ARMYs were definitely better and alot of EXO-Ls were immature. Now ARMYs are the worst fandom and EXO-Ls have matured. (EXOLs still have immature fans but not as much as ARMYs) and ARMYs always say it's because their bigger but the truth is EXOLs are in the guinness world records book as the biggest Kpop fandom and second biggest fandom ever (that's another reason they're the better fandom) ARMYs seem like they're more only because they show themselves everywhere more (which is annoying tbh) In terms of support: Both support their group alot. Though i have to give it to EXO-Ls for stuff like gifting EXO shirts with their names and numbers painted on them with pure gold. Breaking album sales records with every comeback. The LED projection on Burj Khalifa has only been used for royalty, flags of arab countries during their national day and during New Years and now EXO a korean boy group\u2019s faces are projected on it thanks to EXOLs. And much more.. Plus i remember this last minute vote thing happening in an american show when they suddenly told people to vote for the best singer or group and gave a very short amount of time (like a veeery short amount of time) and EXO won. I dont remember the name of the show but i remember Ariana Grande announced the winner. In terms of good manners and charity: EXO-L || WHY THEY ARE PART OF THE BEST FANDOMS This explains it all. I do think ARMY will in the future mature and become a better fandom than now but till then EXO L are way more loved by other fandoms now. Journey to success: EXO. i copied this answer from another question and i think it fits perfectly here. EXO deserves everything. They didn\u2019t walk the flower road, they walked the blood road. Ever since the first day of debut, they were never an \u201cunpopular\u201d group. And then everything started. Knetizens bash on EXO-K, they were on the news every day basically. Cnetizens bash on EXO-M, they were seen so low by so many artists. Did SM care? No. Why did EXO become a semi-popular group, and they still are like as if they are about to disband? The debut song, Mama, they performed it for a year. What did they do during the whole year? They went to the cast of K-shows and performed in the back as a scene. The second year, they came back. HUGE. They became one of the top boy groups in Korea. During this time, Kris went back to China with the excuse of his family. Everyone said that he is not going to come back. He came back for EXO Showtime, and fans were so happy. Despite the number of times Suho mentioned group spirit and responsibility, he left. He left 8 days before the first world tour. What does that mean? They have to re-do everything. They have to distribute the lines again, they have to do a different dance formation, and they must do and master it in a week. From getting the moves done to mastering it, they have to get it done for the first world tour. They didn\u2019t have time to eat anything, they stayed up so late every day to practice. If they really can\u2019t handle it anymore they would only sleep for 10 minutes and get right back to practice. Suho was so tired he had a high fever. It\u2019s a daily thing for every member to go to the hospital. Lay\u2019s waist injury was so intense, but he was afraid to go to a doctor because he is worried that the doctor is going to need him to rest, and he can\u2019t do that. Kai\u2019s ankle injury caused him to not able to walk normally, still, he literally started living in the practice room. Baekhyun had six intravenous drips in one day. Intravenous drip takes a lot of time, so he just took a ton of medicine and tried to get through it. The first world tour almost cost them their lives. Other K-pop groups get first place in music shows, everyone congratulates them. EXO gets first place in music shows, Suho got attacked by Antis saying that he was fake crying. Other K-pop groups get (a) Daesang(s), everyone says that they deserved it. EXO gets a Daesang, everyone says that SM paid for it. It\u2019s okay, every group got bashed on by netizens at once. An 11-member group, fans\u2019 hearts started aching because of one that left. The second time that they went to Happy Camp (Chinese reality show), all eleven members started sobbing saying that it\u2019s a new start. And then it\u2019s ten. This time, an ace of the group left. During the last concert with Luhan still in EXO, Chen and Xiumin surrounded him and cheered him up. They were following him around everywhere. Fans were innocent enough to think that Luhan is not gonna leave. Finally, people started to chill down, EXO-Ls showed everyone that EXO is a truly honorable group. Then, Baekhyun\u2019s dating controversy came up. Fans and the web were triggered and bashed on him so much. Some EXO-Ls even told Baekhyun to leave EXO, told him to stay away from the other members. When he was in the airport, Antis threw a flower pot at his face. Baekhyun is an idol! He can\u2019t get his face ruined! That\u2019s the rule of K-pop. He is so stupid and he only knows to show his smile to everyone and hide everything. At a concert, he wanted to hold back his tears, but he couldn\u2019t anymore, and he covered his eyes and silently sobbed. Baekhyun got bashed at the whole public, and it isn\u2019t over yet. Lay chose to stay after three has left, and he got bashed on and people told him to leave EXO. My heart aches when I think back at this. Chanyeol was so worn out that he needed oxygen saturation in order to keep performing. Kai had a crutch with him the whole time during the concert stage. Chen performed and sang live with a high fever. Baekhyun had multiple lymph node inflammations, stomach bleeding, and bone fractures. EXO-Ls think that finally, everything should be on the right track, and then it\u2019s just multiple attacks by Antis and the public. It\u2019s not fan wars that mattered anymore. Baekhyun was trying to cheer up an EXO-L that was going through depression, and then the video was falsely edited by an Anti and was being attacked by people from Asia to America by criticizing him, saying that he doesn\u2019t give a care about people in depression and is so disrespectful. Kai drew a cartoon of a bear, took a picture of it, uploaded it to Instagram to share with us EXO-Ls and was called out for plagiarism. Chen lost a game, applied an exaggerating lipstick, and got criticized for racism. Nobody believes what their intentions were, nobody believed them, nobody listened to them instead of their fans. Don\u2019t tell me that groups that came out of big companies are always so much better than small companies, or something like BTS is way more hardworking than EXO because they came out of a big company. Their sunbaes did give them a little of an advantage, but they never brought huge fame to EXO. SM gave them a little extra planning regarding their debut, and they didn\u2019t give anything else other than that. Sehun is a visual, and what did SM give him a lot of? Nothing. Chen\u2019s singing is recognized by the whole music industry, and did SM give him any songs to sing solo? Baekhyun is on Billboard and Melon\u2019s male solo artists' charts, and SM gave him only a little chance for a solo. D.O. is an idol actor that is recognized by the whole movie/drama industry, and every single chance he had he got it himself. Chanyeol\u2019s love for producing could only be published on Soundcloud, SM never gave him chance to put it into an actual album, and he got criticized for plagiarism as well. Xiumin has huge popularity in Korea, and he could top the chart if he wanted to. But SM decided to hide him for most of the time. I admit that all K-pop groups are hardworking, but EXO\u2019s journey to fame has blood with it. Oh well that's a long answer lol. Thanks if you read till here \u2661 ",
