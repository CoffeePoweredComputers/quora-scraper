            "answer_text": "3 songs I CAN'T STAND in no particular order. Please keep in mind these songs are only POPULAR AMERICAN songs within the past 35 years or so. THE FINAL COUNTDOWN by Europe - Many people think this is an epic song, which I can see why it would be, with the signature synth and 80\u2019s rock singing. But it's just that\u2026 The extremely cliched arrangement makes it absolutely corny above anything else for me, and to add to that, the lyrics have to parallel it. I rarely hate songs, but I just can't help that everytime this song plays, I always say out loud, \u201cI hate this song!\u201dSMOOTH by Rob Thomas feat. Santana - I can't stand his voice in this song. It is so overdone with pop ridiculousness. With the video having beautiful dancing girls in a festive setting, it makes me feel ashamed that because Santana did this song, it's supposed to appear Latin and cool. Ugh! It's the same thought process as people going to Chevy\u2019s for some \u201creal Mexican\" food. Argh! (Btw, I have nothing against Chevy\u2019s. It's pretty good for chain \u201cMexican\u201d restaurant. But it's a different story if someone actually believes that is the TO-GO place for Authentic Mexican.)BUTTERFLY by Crazy Town - This song came out in early 2000's and I could not stand that this was somewhat of a hit. What I couldn't take was not only were they were appropriating black culture using a late-80's rap beat, but they didnt have decent rapping skills to go with it. Then they had this \u201ccool\u201d look with tattoos and piercings, trying to seem sensual yet tough, to go with the lyrics. I hate the \u201chook\"/chorus which is something like \u201cCome my lady, come, come my lady\u2026\u201d It's so freaking cheesy, it makes me want to punch the singer and the rest of the band members in the face. Yes, this song is THAT bad for me!!!",

            "answer_text": "My hatred for some songs stem from when I was a radio DJ in the early to mid 90\u2019s. The music we would play at the radio station I worked at was more of the alternative rock at the time, some urban, pop, etc. It was your standard CHR format of the time. In 1993 a band broke on the scene called 4 Non Blondes with their single \u201cWhat\u2019s Up\u201d.  It was in heavy rotation, almost to the point of nausea (for me). The song was just dumb overall and I couldn\u2019t stand Linda Perry\u2019s hollering - \u201cand I scream from the top of my lungs - WHAT\u2019S GOING ON?\u201d There were even times in the song that recalled me to the crooning of Tiny Tim\u2019s \u201cTip Toe Through the Tulips\u201d. I\u2019m almost certain that\u2019s where she got the inspiration for the song. Dreadful. Another abomination of a song was \u201cGlycerine\u201d by Bush.  I could never understand what attracted people to this song. It sounded like Gavin Rossdale strumming on a guitar at gunpoint while fighting the stomach flu. Horrible. Another hated song from that era is \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s\u201d by Deep Blue Something.  Oh, I admit at first I liked the song. It was catchy, melodic. Then, it wears on you especially after you listen closer to the idiotic lyrics. Later, I did something that I should have left well enough alone. I listened to their entire album from which the single was released. It was awful. It was dull, boring, and uninspiring. I\u2019ll never get that time back - ever. An honorable mention of most reviled song goes to anything released by Madonna in the 1990\u2019s - especially any single off of the \u201cBedtime Stories\u201d album.  I got to the point in my radio career where I became resentful that just because Madonna released a single off of an album, it automatically became a hit. Really? Take a listen to \u201cSecret\u201d. Music in the mid-90\u2019s became very bland and predictable, especially on the rock scene. Record companies started churning out any band they think could get airplay. I called them \u201cFlavor of the Month Alternative Rock Bands\u201d because they would put a lot of promotion behind them only to switch to another new band the following month. One band that comes to mind is Dishwalla, with their single \u201cCounting Blue Cars\u201d.  Tell me, have you heard of Dishwalla lately? They\u2019re not exactly burning up the charts. Just like their fellow musicians, Deep Blue Something, they are nothing more than a footnote to 90\u2019s alt-rock music. Finally, sadly, a song I have to add to this list is \u201cUnforgiven\u201d by Metallica.  I adore the band. They are my absolute favorite band and I will watch or listen to anything Metallica, but I cannot bring myself to listen to that song. It just trudges along and it was made worse by spawning two sequels - \u201cUnforgiven II\u201d from the Reload album and \u201cUnforgiven III\u201d from Death Magnetic. I really wish they would have left it alone with the Black Album. Instead, they had to have a trilogy of sorts for this song. When it comes down to it, I prefer my Metallica music to be hard, heavy, fast, driving. That\u2019s not to say I dislike \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d, however. That song I have a special connection to. So, that\u2019s it. My most hated songs. Don\u2019t hate me because I hate these songs. ",
