            "answer_text": "This may be a little long winded but I want to give what I feel is an intelligent answer. Lets start with the history of White American\u2019s strong belief in Manifest Destiny, the White America\u2019s fear of losing it\u2019s majority and decapitation of the two party system. I know that your question ask only of Donald Trump but he is only a small part of the equation of how he has so many supports and who those supporters are. A political storm was evolving and the \u201cestablishment\u201d of both parties where sleep at the wheel. This storm was a mixture of a one percent that is motivated self-interest, the greed of their wealth and the petty differences over who has the right ideal. Combine that with an obstructionist government that doomed Americans into becoming a consumer market and not the producers of that market. In addition over the last decade this storm drove our children to become disenfranchised and frustrated with the political system that dashed their dreams of hope and change as they watched the leadership they chose as president, being obstructed and dismissed by the established party leadership. This leadership with their PAC\u2019s and special interest groups injected a one-sided conversation filled with soundbites and consumer commercials directed to the conservative and moderate liberal media which polarized the political right, the independents, and the Tea Party as their elected officials were too busy being obstructionist to listen to the voters. In walks Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, \u201cthe fringed\u201d versus \u201cthe establishment\u201d of the Two Party System. Scholars and political junkies has known and always understood that in a two party system, it is hard for a third party to win an election; So if you are a Socialist, Libertarian, Tea Party Leader or a member of the Me Myself and I Party, who has never agreed with a two party system, how does one get elected to the presidency? Hijack or take over one or both parties with a viable third party candidate. Donald Trump speaks to an entirely different demographic which consist of the Tea Party, White Supremacist, angry White men, the angry Blue Collar, all who have become disheartened with the modern day conservative leadership of the Republican Party. Let\u2019s not be coy, Donald Trump is a member of the Me, Myself and I Party, he will not fit into the conservative view, but he will bend the conservative view to the view of Donald Trump. Donald Trump and the Trump family are members of the Trump Party ~ A 2011 report by the \u201cCenter for Responsive Politics showed that over the previous two decades of U.S. elections, Donald Trump made contributions to campaigns of both Republican Party and Democratic Party candidates, with the top 10 recipients of his political contributions being six Democrats and four Republicans. Then after 2011, his campaign contributions were more favorable to Republicans than to Democrats, all due to the Trump self-interest. That self interest includes the operation, ownership, development, and investment in real estate around the world. Bernie Sanders speak to that demographic that is not sold on Hillary Clinton, would not follow a Ted Cruz or a Donald Trump. With Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton on the precipices of being the presumptive nominees, Bernie Sanders has no obligation to either party because he is not a part of the established two party system. This will become problematic for the Democratic Party going into the convention. An Independent candidate is not beholden to any special interest group, has no allegiance to Political Action Committees and is not necessarily obligated to side with the ideology of a liberal or a conservative ideal. Bringing more voters and convincing long time voters to its point of view could cause dissension among delegates on the convention floor. So as a conservative, how does Donald Trump look after traditional American values? How did American conservatism get hijacked by Donald Trump and the American Tea Party? It was through anger, obstructionism and racism that America now has Donald Trump as the leader of the Republican Party and Bernie Sanders as the \u201cfly in the ointment\u201d causing headaches for the Democratic Party. This paradigm of policy obstruction, celebrity, shoot from the hip politics, anger at Wall Street all being used and orchestrated by the self-interest of the rich and powerful in using the one percent controlled news media\u2019s in order to gain control of the White House. The plan for control for the White House started after the 2008 election. The first warnings came through the words of Senate majority leader, Addison Mitchell \u201cMitch\u201d McConnell, Jr. \u201cmy number one priority is making sure president Obama\u2019s a one-term president.\u201d This was the first warning sign that a plan was created by the rich and powerful to regain the presidency. The rich and powerful in using the one percent controlled news media systematically laid the foundation to gain influence over the American voter. Manipulated issues and created bias for control of the White House. The one percents failure in this scheme however, was its inability to focus on selecting a viable candidate who\u2019s message would resonate with the American voter, especially the core voters of the Republican Party. The establishment of the Republican Party were wrong in choosing John McCain and Mitt Romney as its leader and the American voter was not excited over another Bush presidency. The established Washington insiders was only interested in Tea Party members as a voting block and was not truly inclusive, receptive or interested in a Tea Party leadership in the White House as that would disrupt its plans and be counterproductive to its goal. It was also the fault of ego that no \u201cone\u201d established Republican candidate could emerge as the leader or the front man for the Republican Party. It is because of this, policy obstruction in congress and the senate, celebrity, shoot from the hip politics, anger at the establishment and the anger of the disconnected Tea Party members that a savvy businessman and deal maker like Donald Trump is now the leader of the Republican Party.

            "answer_text": "People support his politics because he is a Republican. The GOP or \u201cGrand Old Party\u201d has been running strong for quite some time. Republicans are typically more likely to be involved in Christianity than people in the democratic party. This means that they are all about worshipping God, the sanctity of marriage, and stricter laws on abortions. There are many \u201chardcore\" Republicans who are against gun control, abortions, and people not following the \u201crules\" that are in the bible. There are many Republicans who will blindly vote for Republicans no matter what and never give the Democrats a chance. On the flip side people in the democratic party are more likely to be atheists, and not care if somebody gets an abortion. I hate to talk so much about abortion but that's one of the primary issues in this election. During the course of Trump's presidency there has been restrictions put in place in certain states on abortions. Joe Biden has stated that his #1 goal is to make sure that abortions (check his wikipedia page) are a constitutional right for every woman. This is great if you're a pro choice Democrat but the religious right wants nothing to do with that. So, there's a good percentage of Republicans who will vote for Trump no matter what simply based on the abortion rights issue. Interestly, Biden claims to be a big catholic. The catholic church as a whole is generally very pro life or anti abortion. So, there are probably quite a few people (catholics/Christians) supporting Trump simply because they don't like Biden and the atheistic-leaning democratic party. Trump has had some small wins over the term which gives people hope that he's the man for the job. There is a large contrast between Biden and Trump which which is why there is a lot of love/hate towards both politicians. Trump is a big-business celebrity and Biden is a career politician. Donald Trump came from nowhere to win the election. Even though he didn't win the popular vote there were still over 60 million people who voted for him. Many of the people who voted for him may have preferred him over an established politician like Hillary Clinton or the other candidates he beat out for the nomination. I know it sounds sad (to the democratic party) but Donald Trump has some sex appeal. He has been a tabloid/magazine fixture for decades and his wife is smoking hot. He's also a billionaire with a large business/real estate empire. I understand the democratic party and many other people consider him a con-artist/criminal, but he always seems to get away with everything which adds to the appeal. Trump has traveled all over the world and met with the big leaders like Vladimir Putin and the Chinese president. He went to to India, Europe etc. This is good politics for for him because who is going to argue with you when you are sitting next to other super-powerful leaders at events like the G-20 summit \u2026? \u201cThe Donald\u201d as his fans refer to him was even so bold as to visit a dictator in N Korea. Naturally, the democratic party flipped out over the photo op. Trump was able to have a civil conversation with the dictator and give hope that the two nations can work towards a peaceful future. So, Donald Trump has accomplished many of the things he campaigned on. He signed a big bill right away to pay for the cost of upgrading the infrastructure. He has also been strong on the military and made sure it will be healthily funded. People who voted for him shouldn't be disappointed\u2026neither should anybody else. Donald Trump is fairly predictable but has has an undeniable x factor that keeps people on the edge of their seats. He's been on a hot streak recently even though he is accused of killing tens of thousands of people with his actions during the coronavirus pandemic. ",
