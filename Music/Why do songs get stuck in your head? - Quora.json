            "answer_text": "My personal experience with earworms (music imagery) written five years ago. I need to put some background here so maybe ppl can understand why music is more than music to me. I am participating in an ear-worm study. All my life I've wondered why I wake up with a song in my head. All day long, I've danced to my ear-worms. I love them. This is the letter I sent to the Earwormery Study: Hello, I am a female age 62. I have experienced ear-worms upon ear-worms for 48 years. Never knew the term \"ear worm\" until today. At age 15, I awoke paralyzed by ms. 1965. My brain was not fully formed yet so I learned to re-route over the damage. And I used music primarily as a tool. After returning from the hospital, still paralyzed on my left side, I had a ten day bout of vertigo that almost killed me. I lay in bed unable to turn my head without terrible spinning. For ten days, I could not eat, drink or get up. I went down to 80 lbs. During this time, my Mom played music on my turntable over and over and over. Simon & Garfunkel and Donovan. After recovering from the vertigo I still had the paralysis to deal with. So I sat on the living room floor and listened to music through earphones while working puzzles. I listened to music while I did physical therapy. At age 17 (196emoticon cool, I left home for university. I danced, literally, through the next 48 years. And I have had ear worms upon ear worms since I was age 15. My theory was/is that somehow while I was re-routing my brain the music filled some of the holes left in my brain. My ear worms saved my life. Dancing over and over to the songs in my head kept my body strong. Even when I worked out I had earphones on and kind of danced on the treadmill. I'm age 62 now and still dance at the slightest note. A word in a conversation or on the TV will trigger ear worms, I dance to the music in my head. Even in the market, I will start dancing. I believe it stems from using music to re-route my brain cells. Thank you for listening, Janice L I really believe that it is part of my ms. I have no control over it. Absolutely none, hence why would I break out singing in the middle of being kidnapped??? Thanks guys, xoxo Janice ",

            "answer_text": "The phenomenon of annoyingly persistent earworms is a great introduction to the meme theory: the idea that songs (and all other forms of cultural expression) are self-replicating informational \"viruses\" that use the mind as their host, the way DNA viruses use living cells and software viruses use computers. The best overview of this theory is Susan Blackmore's book The Meme Machine. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Meme_Machine By this theory, the most widespread songs will be the ones that get themselves copied for whatever reason, whether they're welcome to their human hosts or not. It's no mystery that I find Duke Ellington melodies catchy, I love his music more than anything. But I intensely dislike Andrew Lloyd Webber, yet I find his songs even catchier than Ellington's. This demands an explanation. In my observation, the stickiest songs are the ones most finely tuned to the limits of your attention span and pattern-seeking tools. Earworms are mostly predictable and repetitive, but just complex and surprising enough to stimulate your pattern-seeking reflex. \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\" is easy to memorize, but the brain \"solves\" it so quickly that it doesn't linger endlessly the way Andrew Lloyd Webber songs do. Ellington tunes are repetitive too, but the main motifs are more complex, requiring more attention, and eventually they wear your pattern recognizers out.  The interesting and potentially useful thing about the meme theory of music is that it suggests you can measure the catchiness of a song by the amount of symmetry it contains. Too little symmetry and the song will be too complicated to be memorable. Too much symmetry and your brain will solve the pattern immediately and lose interest. I leave it to the math people how to formalize these parameters, but I've known musicians to try to work them out in an ad hoc way. I have a friend from college (a big Andrew Lloyd Webber fan, by the way) who deliberately set out to write catchy tunes. He'd sit at the piano in the student center playing material he was working on. Then he'd go hang around the nearby snack bar. If anyone there was unconsciously humming what he'd just been playing, he knew he had a winner. ",
