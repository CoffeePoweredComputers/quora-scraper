            "answer_text": "We will here discuss in brief about the properties of sound, noise and music in brief. Hope you will find the same interesting. Sound waves are basically a form of vibration that travels through mediums such as air and water. These are a direct result of particles coming together and spreading apart. Sound waves have frequency, amplitude, wavelength, direction and speed. Sound waves can be reflected, refracted and attenuated as they pass through a medium. Music and Noise are both an outcome of sound. The impact of music has an embalming effect on ears and mind, while noise arouses a sense of incoherence. Music follows a set pattern of changes in amplitude, wavelength and usually sports high frequency. Noise however follows asymmetrical wavelength, amplitudes and low frequency. Music is all about harmony, while noise is all about pandemonium. Consonance and Dissonance are two factors that decides the quality of music. Music frequented by consonance is more amiable to the ears owing to the smooth flow of the same. Dissonance in music causes disruption of rhythm resulting in obnoxious sensation in the ears. I may infer here by saying that the sense of pitch, rhythm, harmony varies from person to person. Even their reaction varies to the kinds of sound, noise and music. Thus the awareness of sound, noise and music is not same for everyone. ",
