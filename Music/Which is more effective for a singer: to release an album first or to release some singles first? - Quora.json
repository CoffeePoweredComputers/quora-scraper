            "answer_text": "Always release a few singles before the album. Theres a couple of reasons. 1 it builds momentum and buzz. 2 singles are easier to consume, even when you release an album, they arent likely to listen to the album, and even less likely to just buy it outright. 3. It maximizes profits in 2 ways. The first is you essentially get people to buy the song twice. Once for the single and again when they buy the album. And the 2nd goes back to momentum. If they like your single then they are more likely to buy the album. Theres great blog post about how to release a single here. How to Release a Single, Album, or EP ",

            "answer_text": "This depends on a number of factors including your specific situation and how you feel your music is best presented.  In some cases, especially if you are within certain genres, you may feel that a full album is necessary to properly present your music.  In other cases, including pop, many artists are finding that it's more cost effective and strategic to create and shop singles or EPs, and hold off on releasing a full album til they feel they're ready. A current example would be Halsey.  There are also now labels that deal exclusively with digital singles. ",
