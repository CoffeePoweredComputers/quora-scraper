The first times i heard it i was like: \u201cgreat, another shitty song\u201d, but it started going on the radio and i ended falling in love with it. It is just like a disney song and the lyrics is just amazing (something that probably wasn\u00b4t taken in account for obvious reasons). I understand why people who doubt it, and respect. I think ours was one of the most different and passionate songs, but sure, there were some others that were really really good. Again, im not the qualified to defend this because 1) im portuguese. 2) im only have the common knowledge in music. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cDeserving\u201d is a highly subjective thing. It's impossible to determine objectively if one song is \u201cbetter\u201d than another. It all depends on personal taste. However, considering Salvador won both the jury and the public votes by a significant margin and didn't break any rules, I think we can say his win was consensual that he won the contest \u201cfair and square\u201d. Wether he \u201cdeserved\u201d it or not, it's up to each individual to decide for him/herself. ",

Something about the way he presented himself felt really off - I did enjoy the song when Luisa sang it, though. If I had to choose, I would have chosen Hungary. But somehow, he did appeal to a ridiculously large amount of people, and he did it in his native language, with an underappreciated genre, for the first time for his country. As fishy as it sounds to me, he did win fair and square, so\u2026 yes, he did deserve it. As much as I hate to admit it. ",
