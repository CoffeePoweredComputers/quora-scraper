            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s the thing about artists like Billie. Ok for example Drakemis getting a lot of heat right now for texting her. Yes he was also texting the girl from stranger things but that aside people talked shit on Drake just for this alone. I\u2019m, have you seen Billies video for Bad Guy? She mentions how her knees are bruised for whoever she\u2019s singing snot and basically the song is about how this guy is trying to be macho to impress her but in reality she\u2019d **** him anyways and then the end of the video shows her in a red lit room with what appears to be her going up and down with a lustful look on her face as we find or she\u2019s sitting on a guy doing push-ups. Ok dude you can\u2019t say that oh she\u2019s so cool and ag the same time hate on a guy like drake for texting her cuz \u201cshe\u2019s 17\u201d. She\u2019s glorifying sex, she makes it seem as though she\u2019s a depressed junkie when in reality if you glorify those things at 17, you\u2019re probably neither and I think what\u2019s even creepier is that her 20sometjibg year old brother helps her write these sex driven lyrics. If that was me I\u2019d have nothing to do with anything involving my underaged sisters sexual life or habits. To me that\u2019s way worse than Drake texting her, no ones seen those texts he could have good intentions. It\u2019s drake I know we ALL know what his intentions really are and I don\u2019t like the guy or his music but until you\u2019ve read the texts you can\u2019t say for sure. My thing is the beats and melodies of her music are repetitive techno, I think her brother who is apparently the \u201cgenius\u201d behind the music is either in the closet or has some sort of weird affection for her and uses her to express himself without it coming off as way too weird and tbh she\u2019s probably going to burn out quickly, you can only play the junkie card without being a junkie before either you do become one or b. You have nothing else to sing about because you were a persona the whole time not yourself and as an artists unless you\u2019re David Bowie you can only play that card for so long before people get bored don\u2019t because it lacks authenticity EDIT: Also I forgot, I hate her attitude tbh and girls are popping up with the same fuckin sassy ass attitude thinking they\u2019re gangster junkies just cuz they smoke pot and as a drug addict it\u2019s annoyig that they expect you to give them drugs and when you don\u2019t they say shit like \u201cyou\u2019re a fucking junkie, loser!\u201d It\u2019s like \u201cyeah I know I\u2019m a junkie, that\u2019s why I\u2019m not sharing my f-ing drugs with you\u201d . Billie Elish is far too overrated as an artist. Like another answer said she doesn\u2019t even sing. She doesn\u2019t do anything but glorify things that don\u2019t need to be florified especially by someone who shouldn\u2019t be talking to a certain person cuz that person is a grown man. Well then stop singnjbg about blowing people and doing drugs EDIT: so I\u2019m writing this probanly about two months after the original posting and the day after the oscars. I do not take back anything I\u2019ve said. Despite the fact I won\u2019t say her performance was awful or anything of the kind, what was he point of her being there? First of all to most of her fans you\u2019re probably gonna think that\u2019s her new jam or whatever no, for those of you that don\u2019t know it\u2019s an absolutely haunting mesmerizing and beautiful song that\u2019s credited to The Beatles but was really Paul McCartneys first solo attempt at a hit. Though once again her performance was not awful, I think they could pulled more emotion just having the orchestra play the song using the strings as the melody, because for one yes I realize it\u2019s during the memoriam so rhe performance should not upstage, but she tried to hard to make it \u201cmore haunting\u201d so much to the point she sounded like she was doing a decent karaoke performance but nevertheless just that, a decent kareoke performance not a delivery by a decent multi Grammy award winner. In conclusion it\u2019s led me to believe she has someone behind the scenes pumping money into her persona, or somewhere along the line she is being sponsored by big money such as really? She\u2019s the first one to sweep the four main Grammy award catergories? Think about that. Think about all the prodigal musical talents throughout the years all the musicians that transcended an area of making everyone feel like they were Helen singing the same words they were, all the musicians that made their guitars weep so intensely they made YOU weep, and she\u2019s rhe first one to sweep like that? She\u2019s really not THAT good. And once again, why was she there? If she had not been there I don\u2019t think anyone would\u2019ve cared especially since her music targets preteens and teens, which do not make a huge percentage of Oscar viewers. Plus what was up with her look of disgust during maya Rudolph\u2019s and what\u2019s her faces song mixup. Does she not know they\u2019re comedians? She gave a look of are they serious and it\u2019s like no Billie they\u2019re not they\u2019ve made a living of not being serious ",

            "answer_text": "I decided to check around to see what the big deal is about her. Reddit posts are sorta 50/50 regarding her but they did touch on a topic that I resonated with. Her style of singing (if you can call it that) is very much in right now I suppose. The sort of whisper and low volume type of singing that sometimes gets you away with not being able to hit higher notes at a louder volume. She is almost just talking with some sing-songy flair added to it. To me and apparently a lot of other people, this isn\u2019t really considered skillful singing I guess. Some vocal coaches like her though so she\u2019s got something going for her. It\u2019s good breath control I guess to push just enough air through to vibrate the vocal cords for sound. Now I don\u2019t have much issue with her and I only discovered her maybe 3 months ago. She reminds me of the fact that this is kind of a new niche in pop music, kind of like when mumble rap came out and the more traditional rap fans all lost their minds. There\u2019s also talk on these forums that her songs sometimes are fake and disingenuous while seemingly glorifying how it\u2019s cool to be angsty or depressed. I have a friend who struggles hard with mental health and it\u2019s nothing to sing about. I\u2019m frequently worried and monitoring his language to see at what point he might actually try to take his own life. Real depression is rough and I just wish her teenage fans didn\u2019t glorify it that much thinking it\u2019s so edgy and cool. But aside from the material, I personally can\u2019t sit through her music too much. She\u2019s filling a niche that I don\u2019t appreciate. The type of singers I pay attention to are people like Bruno Mars, Dimash Kudaibergen, Ariana Grande, you know, the types that really play around with their vocal abilities in their music -the ones that have pipes on them. To me it shows they\u2019ve trained and practiced to do what many others cannot do or can\u2019t do with ease. But hey, it\u2019s why we have variety and if she\u2019s successful, then good on her. She\u2019s found an audience that will listen to her and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. People just like to hate sometimes. ",
