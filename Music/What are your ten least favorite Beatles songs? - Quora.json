            "answer_text": "I seem to recall that back in the early 1970s, WPLJ and the Village Voice ran a poll asking fans what their least favorite Beatles\u2019 song (or, as Apple Corps would prefer us to style it, their least favorite song by The Beatles) was. There\u2019s some overlap with the answers given so far here, and elsewhere. At the top of that list, and included almost de rigeur on many of these lists, is \u201cRevolution 9\u201d. I\u2019m going to leave it off mine because it\u2019s not a song. If you want to call it the worst Beatles\u2019 track, you\u2019re on firm semantic ground. But leave your lists of worst Beatles\u2019 songs to tracks that have actual chord progressions and melodies, or at least sound like they were meant to. In no particular order \u2026 \u201cBaby You\u2019re a Rich Man\u201d. If I had to pick one Beatles\u2019 single I would be happy never to hear again, it\u2019s this one. I know John wrote it to make fun of the \u201cweekend hippies\u201d of the era \u2026 unfortunately, he was more successful at that than even he probably wanted, and as a result the song is as annoying as they were\u0001\u2014that whiny Mellotron lead and John\u2019s deliberately evasive lyrical self-interview being two of the major reasons why. And also, from a modern perspective, I really don\u2019t want the Beatles to be the sort of group that ended a song with \u201cBaby you\u2019re a rich fag Jew\u201d, even if it was meant as a playful dig at Brian Epstein.\u201cDo You Want to Know A Secret?\u201d Probably the earliest Beatles\u2019 song that makes a lot of these lists. And it\u2019s easy to see why\u2014you go from that overly melodramatic intro to that annoyingly singsong verse part that sounds like it was written for a fourth-grade music class to sing along to with their teacher. Really, the whole song sounds like it was written by some lesser songwriters who were told to write something that sounded like a Beatles song and maybe the Beatles themselves would actually record it.\u201cPiggies\u201d Even if Charles Manson hadn\u2019t totally ruined this one (not, contra Bono, \u201cHelter Skelter\u201d), it is about as subtle, lyrically, as a sledgehammer, to the point that you start feeling sorry for the putative targets. Roger Waters did this lyrical idea much better for Pink Floyd ten years later.\u201cRun for Your Life\u201d Actually not a bad song musically. But lyrically totally reprehensible today, as it basically glorifies jealousy to the point of homicidal rage. To be fair, Lennon himself said, about ten years later, after he\u2019d taken a more mature look at that aspect of himself in \u201cJealous Guy\u201d, that he was deeply embarrassed by this song.\u201cOnly a Northern Song\u201d George\u2019s whine about not getting a share of publishing royalties equal to Paul and John was supposedly written in about 40 minutes and never meant to be recorded. But then \u2026 they ran short on material for Yellow Submarine, and guess what? There was this song just sitting there (Kiss fans may recall that something similar led to \u201cBeth\u201d). A shame, really, because George was also responsible for \u201cIt\u2019s All Too Much\u201d, that album\u2019s only really memorable track.\u201cHello Goodbye\u201d Not so much annoying to listen to as just uninspired-sounding. The \u201cDo You Want to Know A Secret?\u201d of their later career in that it sounds more as if some other, less talented group of songwriters had been tasked with writing a Beatles song to be recorded by the Beatles. Wears out its pretty thin lyrical conceit by the end of the first verse.\u201cHer Majesty\u201d You can see why they put this little bit of studio goofery at the very end of Abbey Road and didn\u2019t bother to tell people it was there \u2026 it is useful only as a sort of inverse of the trick ending on the album\u2019s first side (where, if you didn\u2019t remember, \u201cI Want You (She\u2019s So Heavy)\u201d just abruptly ends mid-bar, making you think something happened to the playback until you see that is indeed complete).\u201cGood Day Sunshine\u201d Vulture ranks this one the absolute worst Beatles song. It (or rather, a cover version) had been used in a U.S. TV commercial recently, sort of reminding me it existed, and frankly I wish they hadn\u2019t. Musically it\u2019s nothing special, and lyrically \u2026 well, they explored this idea with better music in \u201cSun King\u201d and, on that same album, did it better than anyone else has with \u201cHere Comes the Sun\u201d.\u201cOb-La-Di Ob-La-Da\u201d It\u2019s well-known that if McCartney was less than thrilled about \u201cRevolution 9\u201d being on the White Album, Lennon felt the same way about this. I can stand hearing this every now and then, but I can easily understand how Lennon could have been driven nuts by hearing this all day in the studio.\u201cYou Know My Name (Look Up The Number)\u201d What does it tell you about the Let It Be sessions, such as they were, that they consigned this one to a B-side? Especially when it was originally recorded earlier for the Plastic Ono Band. When you read that McCartney at one point considered this his favorite Beatles song, you understand why years later he had to write \u201cSilly Love Songs\u201d to explain himself.",

            "answer_text": "Well, you can\u2019t argue taste. People like/hate what they will. I still can\u2019t help but laugh at the fact that almost all the responses have at least 2 of my favorite songs on them! So weird. There are 2 categories for me. One is of songs I don\u2019t necessarilly dislike, but tend to skip most of the time. The other is of songs I just don\u2019t like at all. The following is the latter category (I\u2019m not including covers, otherwise the list would be longer): In no particular order\u2026 Octopus\u2019s Garden. Shoulda been a B-side, if it needed to exist at all. Better yet, held for a Ringo solo album.Yesterday. The melody doesn\u2019t make up for the lyrics. Would have preferred a song about scrambled eggs.I\u2019m Happy Just to Dance With You. Annoying yawn.Honey Pie. Too goofy. Wayyyy too goofy. Bad Paul! Bad Paul! Go lay down. Good boy.Flying. Coulda been better, but I think they were all too fucked up to try harder.Wait. A throwaway from Help, which should have remained thrown away.Nowhere Man. It works in the movie, but too trite compared to the rest of Rubber Soul, except Wait.Dig it. Never should have been released. Luckely, they didn\u2019t release the long version. Ouch.Let it Be. Over and over and over and over (and over) with terrible advice. The Sesame Street version (\u201cLetter B\u201d) is far superior.Why Don\u2019t We Do it in the Road. Great demo, Paul! Whattaya say we get the boys together and rock this one out! No? OK, howabout giving it to a band that will have some fun with it? No? Would you consider keeping it off the album? I mean, you already have 2 songs without another Beatle playing, so, y\u2019know. What? I\u2019m fired? You\u2019re fired! C\u2019mon George, let\u2019s get outa here!",
