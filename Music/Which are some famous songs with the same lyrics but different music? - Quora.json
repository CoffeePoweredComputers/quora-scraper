            "answer_text": "From another angle: many classical composers composed settings for the Catholic liturgy -- the most famous one I can think of is that Mozart's Requiem and Faure's Requiem have the same words in many movements (to name just two of many requiems).  Generally, any classical pieces (usually movements) that share the name Kyrie or Gloria or Te Deum (etc.) have the same words. This question got a lot more interesting in the late 20th century  (or maybe it's just in pop) -- it used to be a lot more  common  to find a text and write music to it, rather than creating new words every time.
