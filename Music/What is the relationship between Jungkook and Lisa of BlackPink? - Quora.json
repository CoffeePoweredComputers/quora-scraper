            "answer_text": "No, there is nothing between Jungkook and Lisa from what I know. First of all, it SUPER annoys me when fans pinpoint the tiniest actions between Kpop idols and make it seem like they\u2019re dating. Let me provide a few examples. \u201cOh, look! They bowed and smiled at each other! THEY\u2019RE DATING!!!\u201d \u201cHey, they both of matching colour coats! They\u2019re in some sort of secret relationship!!!\u201d Let me get this straight - I am not one of those jealous, obsessed fans who think that my \u2018oppa\u2019 should not be with anyone else but me. But come on, this is a bit much. Fans sometimes take just bowing and Kpop idols nodding in each other\u2019s directions, and SOMEHOW turn them into \u2018evidence\u2019 that the two idols are dating. Any of the footage or evidence that you\u2019ve seen so far only shows signs of common respect in Korea, nothing special. Honestly, if fans continue to do this, they\u2019re just giving other fans reasons to shower hate on the idols and spread fake ass rumours. So far, Lizkook shippers are only taking polite claps, smiles, glances and small reactions to testify their claims. Lisa has never, ever mentioned Jungkook anywhere, and neither has Jungkook mentioned Lisa. Sorry if I sounded too rude back there. But no more words can just explain how ticked off I am at the fans who start spreading rumours about idols and creating fake news just to bring attention to themselves. Yes, you asked the question out of pure curiosity - and I am answering it. Nope, there is currently - quote unquote - nothing going on between Lisa and Jungkook. ",
