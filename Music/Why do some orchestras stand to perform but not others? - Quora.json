            "answer_text": "Note that not all of the musicians in your video are standing. Some instruments cannot be played standing (eg the cello and organ) or are awkward to play standing (harpsichord). It is common for soloists to stand, as it makes them more visually prominent. Having the orchestra stand is not uncommon for period instrument ensembles, doing music from the Baroque or earlier. After that, the size of orchestras increased to the point where sitting became the norm. Also, playing while standing is more tiring. I wouldn\u2019t want to do an entire Wagner opera standing! Basically, the smaller the group, the better it looks to stand - it is more like a group of soloists. Having a hundred people standing onstage with various instruments (and some sitting because they cannot stand) would not look good - it would look like a mob. In the end, it\u2019s the choice of the conductor - but if our conductor asked the orchestra to stand, there would be negotiations and I\u2019m pretty sure we would refuse. I just did a performance of the Mozart Gran Partita for winds and double bass, and the conductor originally suggested we stand. But this was pretty quickly shot down as a couple of the people had physical issues that would have made standing a hardship. ",

            "answer_text": "If you don\u2019t use a lot of chairs, you don\u2019t have to hire someone to set up a lot of chairs before you play I\u2019m serious about that. Large symphony orchestras will almost always sit because they have a large stage and a budget for stagehands and their pieces end to be longish. This is a small chamber group. They can get on and off quickly and not need chairs for this fairly short duration cantata. I\u2019ve notice that baroque ensembles like this are tending to stand these days. I think it makes the presentation a bit more visual to see the violins putting their full body into the performance. It makes them look like they are working harder. I notice the audience is in church pews where the back rows are no higher than the front rows. Perhaps by standing, the orchestra is a bit more visible to the whole audience. ",
