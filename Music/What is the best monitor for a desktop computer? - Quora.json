            "answer_text": "It depends on what you\u2019re going to use the monitor for, and also your personal preferences. There are a couple of key qualities that a monitor may have more or less of: Pixel count / pixel density / size & resolutionColor quality, range and consistencyRefresh rateOther qualities (like design, built-in speakers, convenience features like USB hub and more)For a given budget, you may generally pick two out of the first three, and those should be determining your choice. The last category is the sugar on top. I\u2019m not that much of a gamer, I do play games from time to time, but my priorities are not the ones of a gamer\u2019s. Thus, I choose pixel count, a fairly large monitor with a high resolution, paired with great color consistency and quality, but with a fairly slow refresh rate. The monitor I bought a year ago was a 38\u2033 ultrawide 3840 x 1600 monitor with 75 Hz refresh rate and an IPS panel. Driving such a high resolution requires a decent graphics card if you\u2019re gaming, but for desktop/web use, watching videos and not much else, the requirements are much lower. If I were interested in gaming, I would get a graphics card that\u2019s as good as my budget allows, and then pair it with a monitor with high refresh rate, and a resolution to match. Maybe a 1920 x 1080 TN panel at 144 Hz. Color consistency wouldn\u2019t be as good as my IPS option, but for gaming that\u2019s not as big of a deal as having a really fast refresh rate. So, for your choice, look at what qualities you value most, then choose a category matching those qualities and finally pick a monitor that matches your budget. ",
