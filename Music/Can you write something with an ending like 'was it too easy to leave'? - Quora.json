            "answer_text": "Hello, Loneliness is something that eats at you hollowing you from the inside, aching! It's something that stares you right into your eyes and makes you see the darkness that engulfs you and your forthcoming future. It's something that none of us want but so many of us get. So was I wrong in choosing it for myself? Let me narrate you a little of my love life: I am a hopeless romantic and when I fall in love, I Fall! Without any support, any ropes to rescue and definitely without any people to bring me back. I always thought I knew what love is but little did I know my entire perception was about to be changed soon. When I just paased my 12th standard, I joined a gym with my friend and there I saw him for the first time. I remember every little bit of it not visually but the feeling of it (isn't that what really matters). He was just the perfect guy I'd been waiting to get my entire life. He looked and felt like everything I ever wanted; A love of a lifetime! We got to talking as he was as crazy about me as I was about him and it became better and better with time. He was playboy before me who never believed in relationships and he stayed with me for 4 years. So I guess, this was pretty important to him too. And for this drastic change that he had because of me I had to work too hard. I had to show to him how good I was, how much I should mean to him, how perfect would his life be with me in it, how great ot would he if he prioritized me atleast a little above his fake friendships. I was so scared to lose him and he was so okay with losing me. It was a struggle all day, all night. Sleepless nights, stressed out, crying out hugging my pillow. It didn't get easier. After around 4 years of trying to tell someone I should be important in your life, I felt hollow, lonely and single while being in a relationship of 4 years. He now understood my importance in his life and we were too close to the future I've always wanted. And when I was just months away from him being everything I wanted him to be, I Left! The love I was always waiting for didn't seem worth it in the end. I shouldn't have to struggle that much for love, it should come easy and fully. I deserved all of what I was about to get from Day 1. A future with him looked like a struggle and I didn't wanna struggle in love anymore. Because love is supposed to be easy and happy. I shouldn't have to wait for the happy to come in future. If the present sucked, how could the future be any better? You might call me stupid but it was one of the best decisions I made. I almost had touched the life that I thought I always wanted and walked away. I thought that I've prepared well for this, I'll be able to handle but you never know something till it happens in reality. Regret, hate, loathing, issues with self-identity and the worst loneliness followed after the breakup. It's now 7 months since I broke up and I'm better but some days I'm still that struggling little girl. He kept telling me that it was too easy for me to leave or that I moved on too quickly. Now you decide, seeing what you always thought you needed in such close proximity and walking away with tears jammed in my eyes and a bitter smile on my lips, 'Was it too easy to leave?\u2019 \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on a story narration where we leave the ending on a question. Here my entry or a try on this line The sky is beautiful right? Ani voiced her thoughts with a question. It's common for her to beautify smallest object foundin her surroundings to big as sky. So this wasn't new to me. What's new than in this not so new question? Actually it was directed to the man holding her hands. A dusky tall man 5ft 9inch stood there in chrome yellow shorts and white shirt. A hat to cover his bald. Ani stood beside hand, engulfing him in tight embrace. She wore a white mini dress with red polka dots on it. She had a breathtaking smile on her place. The question rang in my ears like a bell. A reminder to our yesteryears when she would stand beside me and ask me the same question. I wonder the change in the circumstances where am I and where is she\u2026 was it so easy to leave\u2026 ",
