            "answer_text": "No. NO. A THOUSAND TIMES NO!!!! 27 is NOT too old to learn ANY instrument you want to learn. (Well maybe oboe might be a bit rough\u2026.) If you have a desire to learn guitar, start out with reasonable expectations. Don't expect wonders overnight. Know that your fingertips will get so sore you just can't see how you can go on (especially if you've got a cheap guitar with a very high action, (i.e., the distance of the strings from the fretboard). But one day when you're still at baby level, you will Grit your teeth, pick up your guitar, and lo and behold, no pain! Good callouses! That's your first milestone. It Doesn't really make any difference what style you want to Learn and perfect. Steps you need to take to become proficient with the instrument are the same no matter what style you prefer. If you're teaching yourself, I would highly recommend Frederick Noad's Solo Guitar Playing Book 1. It gives you enough theory that you aren't left in the dark, it teaches reading music and basic sightreading, and it shows you how to use proper hand positioning and posture. Do not minimize the importance of any of the exercises in Noad's book, if you should choose to teach yourself using his methods. I would highly recommend finding a teacher who will point out what you can do better and more efficiently. Hope this helps! And remember: ENJOY!! ",

            "answer_text": "No, 27 years old is not too old to learn, well, anything. But specific to guitar, I\u2019ve played guitar for the past 30 years. I am familiar enough with the mechanics of playing to say there is nothing from a physical or mental perspective that would stop an average 27 year old person from learning the instrument. learning guitar might be difficult at first, but it gets easier with practice. Rest assured the sore fingers, and frustrations from thinking particular chord shapes are impossible to fret, all pass in due time. I have a 90 year old neighbor who just decided to learn to play piano last year (no exaggeration)! He takes lessons once a week. He has arthritis in all his fingers and he walks hunched over with a severe limp. I hurt just watching him. He doesn\u2019t care. He\u2019s wanted to play piano all his life and decided now is the time to learn it. I admire him. I imagine he\u2019s probably learning a song that\u2019s meaningful to him and his wife and will one day surprise her with it. If you truly want to learn guitar (or anything else), do it. You might be the greatest guitar player of all time (to live on your street). ",
