            "answer_text": "Despite what others said, I\u2019ve played many 49 keys and even 37 keys keyboards over the years. There was this one band where all I played was a 37 key Alesis Micron and nobody complained about it, least of all me. Plenty of keyboards have 49, 37 or even less keys and professional musicians have been using them for decades. Sure, if you want to play expressive piano parts or bigger than life synth pads, 49 keys is short. Accomplished musicians will make the best of even of the smallest of keyboards but they\u2019ll probably feel more comfortable at the full 88 keys of the grand piano or the double 61 keys of the Hammond organ. Anything with less than 61 keys is best suited for synths. The classic Roland Juno 60, Yamaha DX7, Korg M1, all had 61 keys. Modern polysynths often have 49: Sequential Oberheim OB6, Korg Prologue, Behringer Deepmind 12 (the Deepmind 6 has even less keys, only 3 octaves, for something that wants to sound as big as a Juno), Moog Matriarch, and many more. Mono synths can have 3 or even less octaves: Moog Sub37 has 37 keys, Novation Bass Station 2 only has 25 keys\u2026 The great Mellotron only had 35 keys but that didn\u2019t stop it from becoming an historical landmark in modern music. All these have been used by pros all over the world to great effect. Overall, you can do a lot with 49 keys. I\u2019d say synths and some classic keyboard sounds are what that size of keyboard is best for. But 49 keys and a good bit of creativity goes a long way. ",

            "answer_text": "A lot can be done with a 49 key (4 octave) midi keyboard - it\u2019s best suited for non-piano playing such as lead instruments and also strings (I use one for \u201cstring quartet\u201d style parts). It is possible to play piano parts in a band context (where you don\u2019t need to be playing across the whole frequency range), though going up to 61 keys (5 octaves) makes a big difference. Another thing to consider is the other features of your midi keyboard - controls, sliders, buttons and also whether the keys have aftertouch - this adds a level of expression beyond how hard you hit the keys. Hope that helps, Rob ",
