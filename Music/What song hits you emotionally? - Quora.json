            "answer_text": "Whenever I hear Brothers in Arms, by Dire Straits I get something in my eyes and my lower lip starts to tremble. It\u2019s a song about a soldier dying on the battlefield surrounded by his companions, based on the Falkland Islands war but applicable to just about any lethal conflict. There is a particular bond among those who must confront an opposing force. Each member of the band is aware that they face death, and they all depend on the others for support in the hope of overcoming the enemy and getting through it all alive if possible. Of course, the opposition is in the same situation, so the outcome will be bad for at least one side if not both. My own father was among the boys who lied about their age in order to enlist when WWII began. He and the others who made it through that particular meat grinder witnessed horrors that no one who wasn\u2019t there can comprehend. The closest most civilians can come to understanding that hell might be seeing the movie Saving Private Ryan. My husband told me that all his father would say about the beaches of Normandy was that the sea was red and all the fish were dead. My father never told me anything about the action he saw except once when we were walking along a creek during the seven-year drought when there were only small muddy puddles in the creekbed, and the fish were dying. He said it smelled like war, with the rot of death. I was honored one year to attend a reunion of the survivors of his own brothers in arms from the Pacific theater. All these elderly men greeted each other with hugs, and broke into small groups to reminisce about the better times, when they weren\u2019t getting shot at, and to grieve for their friends who had passed since the last reunion. This was the only environment when they were able to bare their hearts to each other, because they were among the only people who could understand what they went through. The song says \u201cwe have just one world but we live in different ones\u201d and \u201cwe are fools to make war on our brothers in arms\u201d. May they all find peace in rest, and may we all find the wisdom to end conflict by peaceful means. Namaste. ",
