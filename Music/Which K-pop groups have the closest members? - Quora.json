            "answer_text": "First, I want to say that I love many groups and watched numerous content from each group that I love. Some of them include iKON, BTS, SUJU, Shinee, Bigbang, Wanna One, SNSD, Red Velvet, Mamamoo, NCT, and more. Second, I really want to say that you can't really say that some group has the closest relationship out of all the KPOP groups, i truly believe that is stupid and unrealistic. I believe, and I think all the groups I love proved it to me, that every group has special bond which is different from other groups. And finally I want to talk about relationship of my ult group, being EXO, at least how I see it. I want to talk about it more because I believe a lot of people has wrong impression. I've seen it so many times, people comparing BTSs and EXOs bonds and as someone who loves both groups I think it is so stupid and incomparable. First, there is so much content that shows BTSs bond, that shows how close they are and how much they love each other, actually there is so much BTS content. You can watch Bangtan TV, BTS Run, Bon Voyage, their constant vlives and twt updates or weverse, like there is so much content that can show you their relationship. With EXO that is not the case, you don't get to see their content on daily level, you don't get another episode of their show each week and then their travel show every now and then, they don't have a channel especially for that kind of videos like Bangtan TV. Actually the difference between BTS and EXO members and their personalities is enormous. Every EXO member is pretty much closed book, they are pretty much introverted and they have boundaries where they want their private life to be just theirs and not show it to everyone, and that is totally fine actually that is something I really love and admire about them. They do not let fans know something that isn't their business and it is completely normaln that they want to keep something private. So I love both groups very much and I believe they all have incredible bonds so I just want to say that you shouldn't jump into conclusions when you see all the BTS content that shows their bond and then say that because you can't see that from EXO they are not close. Now about EXO and EXO alone. As I said I believe that all EXO members appreciate and love their privacy. They are pretty much introverted and human like. I actually don't think there is any other group that has members who are like them and with that kind of bond that I believe they have (again that can be said for every group, cause every group is special in their own way). I believe that that type of personalities they have is something really special in KPOP cause they really don't like being in spotlight more than necessary. I mean look at every one of them, Xiumin, Do, Lay and Kai make it so obvious how much pressure they feel sometimes and I find it so relatable and refreshing. Then you have someone like Baekhyun, he is much more introverted than people assume, he is such a homebody and he enjoys making people happy but he also enjoys making himself happy by spending time alone. Then you have Chen, Suho, Sehun and Chanyeol, they are all more comfortable in spotlight then the first group of members I talked about but they still don't really love their life being in spotlight more then other members, they want their privacy as much as others. So when you see this about them you can see why you can't really read their relationship with others easily. Anyway, I believe they have bond that is so strong, I believe they are more like family than friends actually, and they said that numerous times but somehow everyone chooses to ignore it and say that they don't even like each others that much and that it is all fake and it actually angers me to see someone who didn't even try to learn something about them jumps in the conclusion like that. Actually I think EXO has some of the most honest kpop idols out there, every single one of EXO members say what they think and what they believe even when it is not something fans will like. I mean did you ever see Do not being honest just so he don't hurt someone? I don't think so. So when he said numerous times that sometimes he's members are only thing that is making him continue, that he wishes all the best for his members and that they're like a family which he loves I believe he meant every word. So did Suho when he said the same thing, or Baekhyun, or Chen, or Lay, or Chanyeol, or Kai, or Xiumin, or Sehun, I mean did you all forget that Sehun said that he prayed every night for members? Or did you choose to ignore that like everything else and say they are not close. Or when people use things like 3 members leaving as an excuse to say that they don't like each other, like can you just stop? First, members didn't leave because of other members, they left because of mistreatment, like they wanted more freedom or things SM wouldn't allow them, they even had physical injuries and couldn't see their family's, and you expect them to stay in group just between they love members? Like are you serious? Some things you shouldn't keep up with and if you really care about someone you will understand that, like how Luhan actually talked to members before his decision, Tao wasn't even the one who wanted to leave it was he's father(with full rights) and he cried so much at last concert with EXO. And did you see how Luhan and Lay still hang out sometimes, how he still hasn't unfollowed any of the members, or how Kris said he met right people at the wrong time, how Tao speaks proudly of he's time with EXO, and you choose to ignore that and say that cause 3 members left there is no way EXO are close? I actually think that that only made their bond stronger, that that made them cherish each other more and made saying \u2018\u2019 we are one\u2019\u2019 even more meaningful. I mean go and listen to the Promise and see how they feel. And Lay? People love to use Lay as an argument and it also makes me angry. Like if you tried to get to know EXO you would never use Lay for that and if you didn't isn't it wrong to assume that? Lay cares so much about every one of EXO members, do you ever think about how he had been putting up with mistreatment for a long time like other Chinese members, how he could deal with it like others who left but he choose not to, he chose to stay. Do you think about how he constantly talks about EXO on his solo promotions, how he proudly says he's EXO member and that he misses other members so much. Do you think about he's video call to Xiumin before military enlistment or how he literally ran to airport after he came to Korea just to send Do off? Do you think about how he said he will never leave EXO and how he is so sorry for the members cause he can't be with them? Cause if you think of that I don't think you can say anything like he doesn't care for them and he should leave, because he does, very much, and he shouldn't if he doesn't want, and he surely doesn't want that. Lay can't be with them for now because of he's role in China and he is sorry, but he loves them and misses them very much and so does EXO, they said it numerous times how they miss him and love him. So I believe EXOs bond and relationship between every single one of them is so beautiful and unique. They have been together for so long, they've been through a lot together, like do you think debuting from SM is easy, they lost members, every one of them has been criticized for most stupid things (like dating and now all the hate for Chen, I can't even think about how irrational people who attack them for things like that are), and they still stood next to each other through all of that. They talked about how much they feel like a family and how much they love each other and are comfortable around each other. As I said their relationship is so beautiful, they always support each other, literally every solo activity they have (and they have a lot)they always defend each other (like Sehun calling Suho during his live to say to him that he saw some bad comments and that he is so mad, he told Suho that he shouldn't pay attention to that and that he is the best), the level of comfort they feel around each other ( like when I watched Xiumin in Its dangerous beyond the blanket he was so distant and tense but when he is with EXO he is so natural and comfortable), the way they tease each other and the way they smile at each other (like have you seen Do smile at Baekhyun, adorable), they say they miss the members whenever they do solo activities (like do you think they are obligated to say that kind of things? Or to support each other solo activities?), they show how much they love and care for each other numerous times but you just choose to ignore it. Their relationship is different, it is absolutely not forced in any way, they will not do some unnecessary skinship(like why would they? Do you think that means someone js close?), they will not say more about their bond than they feel is for you to hear and they will not try to prove to you something that isn't for you to approve of. They love and care for each other in most natural and precious way they could. Their relationship is so pure and mature. And I believe every one of them is close to every member and they have so unique relationships between them. Like Bakhyun and Chen, their relationship is sooo adorable, they've been together through audition and thought only one of them will succeed and they both told the other one thay he was great and that he will be chosen, but they were both accepted, they went through audition and training together and debuted in EXO and their relationship is so precious. Or Sehun and Suho, like they are literally so attached to each other that is so adorable and that is all I will say. I am not going to talk about every pair cause if I start I will not finish and I definitely wrote enough, more than enough. To conclude, their bond is so special and strong that it amazes me, you can see it if you think about how they are 9 introverts but when they are together it feels like they are in the most comfortable space they can be. They have relationship that feels like family full of wonderful people who care and love each other deeply but not feel obligated to show that to everyone. And that is beautiful and I like their relationship the most out of KPOP groups, I'm not saying they are the closest or anything (as I said, I think you can't give that title to someone) but it is the bond that I like the most and find so natural and pure, honest and special.

            "answer_text": "I can't really tell you for sure because what we see is on screen and we don't know how they treat each other off screen. I will only focus on boybands since I am not familiar with any korean girlgroups and on bands I am very familiar with. Some EXO members seem very close on camera especially Baekhyun with the members even though there was a rumor that Baek and Chans bromance/romance whatever you believe was scriped. Kai and D.O. seem like they are very close off camera in my opinion. I do believe that Chanyeol and Suho are way closer off camera than they show because they have known each other the longest. In Got7 Yugyeom and BamBam seem very close to each other and of course JJ (Jinyoung and Jaebum) because they were training for a long time together and should've even debuted with Shownu from Monsta X (little funfact). In Monsta X Jooheon and Shownu have an adorable relationship which doesn't seem very scripted and I think Minhyuk is close with many members since he touches / hugs members a lot. Also I.M. and Wonho seem to be very close off camera. I think Monsta X is very close in general since they did No.Mercy together which was cruel and it really brought them together as a group and as friends. BigBang stated that some members were childhood friends. Now to BTS. I may be biased here because they are my UB-group but I think they have the most genuine relationships. I'm not saying the other bands relationships are fake or bad but BTS seems the realest to me and so I'll answer with BTS having the closest members. Taehyung and Jimin are basically best friend goals. They take walks outside at night off camera, Taehyung wrote a song about Jimin, Tae bought Jimin a very expensive birthday gift (gucci sweather for 1100$) and he randomly gifts Jimin some things. They feed each other very often and they called each other soulmates. They plan to travel together. Jungkook seems to look up to Rapmonster like an actual big brother. He asks him what he should pack and always talks about how much of a great leader and role model RM is. He even quotes things RMs father told RM. Suga and Jhope are very very close. Suga once stayed at the dorm on christmas so that Jhope wouldn't have to be alone instead of going home to his own family. They want to do a sub-unit. They wear couple outfits. They have a streaming show which is just them. They may seem to have few interactions on camera but they are very close. They never stop praising each other. Just google \u201cSuga screaming Jhope\u201d. Jhope is the one that comforts Suga when he's crying (Daesang award). Those were just 3 relationships I described. RM and Jin have an awesome relationship too. JKs admiration for Suga is so huge that he won't stop talking about lamb skewers because that's a thing they eat together (=spending time). Jin and Suga called each other perfect roommates and they don't want to change roommates because they like each other that much. Don't get me started on any relationship in which Jimin is involved (especially with JK). But that all is just my opinion and I can't say anything for sure because we don't see them off camera. ",

            "answer_text": "We cannot tell that they are that close just because we saw them hugging in pictures, make jokes in videos, kissing their cheeks on some clips. Perhaps I could tell that they just do it for their fans and all were scripted. You can\u2019t tell this and that group is the closest if one person lacks in attention, gets awkward with co-member and gets shy. Nevertheless, you can still watch them hanging out (but not totally like they\u2019ve known theirselves that deep, like they knew their members everything from their souls to personalities) Believe me or not, GOT7 has the realest and purest relationship among in kpop industry. They don\u2019t hesitate to expose their past history. Maknaes shared problems with their hyungs. (Watch Got2Day. That show isn\u2019t scripted) They don\u2019t care what people say to them, they just want to show their real sides to each other. They diss with each other, make fun with each other, do stupid stuff like no tomorrow. Have you encountered other kpop who can do those things like them? Even myself if I\u2019m not close with one of my member, I won\u2019t make a joke or make silly things with her/him. One of the best example is they\u2019re really close with their members\u2019 families. (have you watched the clip where Bambam pushed Mark\u2019s mom on the pool and Jackson being the rescuer) Bambam\u2019s mom is a die hard fan of GOT7 members, specially to Jaebum. Jackson\u2019s mom is a GOT7 stan, she even posted a picture of each GOT7 members and greet them a happy birthday. Yugyeom and Bambam are best of friends like no one can beat their friendship. You forgot JJP? Real brothers and best friends for almost 8 years and counting and Yugyeom is their die hard fan. Don\u2019t forget Jackson, the biggest fan of GOT6. Jackson is known for being a loyal, protector, savior and make things to lighten up the mood of his members when he feels that there\u2019s something awkward between the six. (Not the literal awkward. You know, some misunderstanding and small fights.) He would take a risk for his 6 brothers no matter what. (Watch Real GOT7 episode 5 so you\u2019ll get what I\u2019m saying. It\u2019s the episode where he defend and protect Yugyeom from JB (All of them were into it btw. Only Jackson can\u2019t stand to what they were doing to Yugyeom. He was born that way. Being a savior with everyone.) Watch and you would cry hard.) That was just a prank though. But still it makes me emotional whenever I watch it lol Yugyeom being a sweet youngest (He tells Jackson that he misses him because he was gone for a while. Jackson was in China at that time.) Yugyeom loves Bambam like his biological brother. Bambam said that if ever GOT7 will be disbanded one day (And I hope that won\u2019t happen) he will take Yugyeom in Thailand to live with him. And before I forget, Jinyoung once said in Got2Day \u201cYou should not ask if we are friends, because being friends and having a deep relationship is quite different. We are family.\u201d Ps. Don\u2019t mind these. They are just cute here. Leader (GOT7) vs. Leader (Jus2)  JackBam coz why not  MarkBam the real siblings.  lols  JJP with their no. 1 fan (youngest son)  *heart beat*  We own the camera .gif  When puberty hits you  Pps. This is just for fun lol lol lol ",

            "answer_text": "The 7 members of BTS are so genuinely close with eachother, just by watching their interactions, their bond as a group is so prominent. This is a major reason as to why I stan them.  They\u2019ve been living together for over 5 years at this point. (A few longer if you\u2019re including pre-debut training) Their personalities are all so different yet blend together really well. I also think it helps that there isn\u2019t ONE super popular member, sure the Maknae line gets more attention, but a lot of the ARMY love and appreciate all of the members. They\u2019ve also gone through so many hardships from the beginning, having debuted from a small unknown company and really working their way up. It\u2019s brought them a lot closer because it\u2019s never really been a strictly \u2018coworker\u2019, success achieving, situation. I think all the members are so close with one another, to the point where you can literally ship any member with any of the others. When watching their interactions, you can see that their relationship extends further than just co-workers or even friends. We see them laughing and having fun together like friends do, but we also see them being vulnerable and having serious conversations. They are a family, a group of brothers (They\u2019ve said so themselves) For instance, in their Burn The Stage series, we witnessed Taehyung and Jin having a small argument, which resulted in tears. But at the end, they talked it out and made up. RM admits in an interview that it\u2019s normal to have conflict but it\u2019s how each person deals with it that matters. Jin saying in that Interview; \u201cNo, we\u2019re not friends, we\u2019re family!\u201d In Bon Voyage 2, when they were talking about their future, Yoongi says he wishes they\u2019d remain close until they\u2019re grandparents.When Jungkook literally wrote a song dedicated to his fellow members (Begin) Talking about how they helped raise him as a teenager and how much he loves and appreciates them :\u201d)  In another interview, Taehyung says that sometimes when they have breaks or promotional activities, they don\u2019t see each other for a few days and he misses the other membersDuring their 2018 Festa, where Yoongi admitted to sending long texts to Jungkook and Taehyung and telling them he loved them.  Jin admitting he gets nervous when he isn\u2019t around his membersIn Bon Voyage 2 when each member had to write a letter to another member and Taehyung literally teared up when talking about Jimin In Run Ep 56, where the members each wrote a poem addressed to themselves as a group. It was super emotional Them comforting each other in sad times. Eg. Jimin comforting Hoseok when he was crying on his birthday, or him hugging Taehyung when he talked about his Grandmothers passing, or comforting Yoongi when he saw his parents in the audience.   When they go out of the way to do something for the other. Eg. In Bon Voyage 3 where members, Taehyung, RM and Jimin randomly bought gifts for the other members because they thought of them.Whenever another member is missing (eg. Yoongi when he was hospitalized or Taehyung at the beginning of Bon Voyage 3) The others constantly bring them up and exclaim that they miss him  They have become so used to each other\u2019s presence. They can tell who the other person is just by hearing them sigh or by smelling their hand? They know each other so well:  Sorry that was super long and I don\u2019t have evidence for some but I just remember hearing them say that. Their bond makes me super emotional, you can probably tell. Honestly, I could talk about this for days on end but I would drown in my own tears. In conclusion, they are a wonderful family who love and respect each other. Please watch this Youtube Video which explains it well:  ",

We dont know the truth by screen but sometimes we can feel the truth. Their family really close each others. their family sometimes have dinner together. Mark\u2019s father consider bambam as his son too and bambam call Mark\u2019s father \u201cdaddy\u201d Jinyoung and JB really close because they were together since audition, debut with name JJP and back to be trainees, then comeback with GOT7, and they comeback again as JJP. They are close in the level that they unconsciously imitating each other. JB once said that maybe their tombstones will be next each other. seems like they are fated. Mark and bambam close each other since trainee because they are foreigners. They even have photos back when bambam still very young but now he has the same height with mark. Bambam and yugyeom really close because they are at the same age Jackson consider bambam as his little brother Yugyeom and Jinyoung just like tom and Jerry everytime, but they really sweet each other when they wrote letter. Youngjae is the lastest member added to the group and another members always encourage him about how well his dance. There was a time when members eat Thai food all day when Bambam was homesick JB didn\u2019t bring his cats to dorm becayse Youngjae allergic to cat fur. another members made fanchants when JJP cameback on 2017 another members cheered Jackson when Jackson started his solo, they even made video about how precious is Jackson. Jackson revealed that He really close with Jinyoung. They have bunch of GOT2DAY videos on youtube that show their closeness. They really naturally funny on every variety show. they understand each other very well. they admitted how sometimes they fight/argue each other but then they made up quickly and it make them even closer. They make fun each other freely. They support each others\u2019 solo activity and they really proud when a member doing solo activity. there was a moment when fans wanted to give Jackson's solo banner and he politely refused by saying \"sorry, this is got7\" they automatically hugged the member who was crying at the concert Each member has a necklace with same shape and when they put it together, it becomes GOT7 logo. You can watch their variety / v live.  sorry for my bad english. ",

            "answer_text": "Shinhwa & BAP. Shinhwa is the other name for brotherhood. They filed a lawsuit against SM together, rejected attractive individual contracts, fought a long legal battle of 12 years, set up their own company, waited for every single member to go and return from their military service, and kick started a new stage of their career. Shinhwa debuted in 1998. Their last comeback was in 2016 with their 13th album. They are the longest running kpop band with no change in the lineup for 19 years. What else is there to say? And well okay I don\u2019t know BAP that well but yeah. Just from the fact that BAP filled the lawsuit as a group, stayed a group after it was resolved (?) speaks volumes to me. Other groups would be: Sechs Kies. They debuted in 1997, disbanded in 2000, stayed friends and collaborated with each other many times for the 16 years they were apart, regrouped in 2016 with 5 out of the 6 original lineup (Ko Jiyoung, who stayed out of the group\u2019s comeback because he has fully left the entertainment industry and has his own business and family to attend to, has voiced up multiple times that he\u2019s always Sechs Kies\u2019 number 1 fan). I would also attribute their closeness to the fact that most of them were friends way before they formed the group. Eun Jiwon and Kang Sunghoon knew each other since 1995 when they were studying abroad in Hawaii. Kang Sunghoon and Ko Jiyoung were elementary schoolmates. Kim Jaeduk and Lee Jaejin grew up together in Busan and were in the same dance crew, they auditioned together for Sechs Kies. It\u2019s their 20th anniversary this year.Super Junior. No one expected SJ to be close, because hey, 13 people is a lot. 2 members have officially left the group to pursue a different career. A few others are tangled up in issues so they\u2019re on a permanent hiatus. SJ brands themselves as a group that\u2019s only \u201cfor show\u201d, but they\u2019ve never acknowledged any number except 13, no matter in what sensitive situation. This group decided to not release any new albums in the 2 years their leader enlisted (to honour his contributions to the team because seriously Leeteuk singlehandedly raised half the members and held the team together through the shakiest debut days), a decision not understood by many. Majority of the member trained together for 3\u20135 years before their debut. \u201cWe acknowledge that each other are different\u201d is why they last so long. Only 2 more members have yet to complete their military service. They started out as a project group that was meant to disband after one year of activity. This year marks their 12th anniversary.TVXQ/DBSK. Some wouldn\u2019t agree because they\u2019ve been apart for longer than they\u2019re together, but I\u2019d like to believe otherwise. Junsu took Yunho home when Yunho was sleeping on the streets. When Yoochun first came from US, his residence was registered under Junsu\u2019s household. I would think TVXQ share a very special bond because of their Japanese debut struggles. In 2006, SM sent TVXQ, who were at their peak in Korea, off to a foreign market: Japan. Japan was NOT receptive of kpop at all. TVXQ was left there, stranded for months, handing out flyers and albums on the street begging people to give them a listen. Most of them ended up with depression. They climbed to the top in Japan together, and broke all kinds of records for foreign singers there. The lawsuit was painfully hard to believe. They had amazing teamwork as 5 and it really shone through their acapellas (I\u2019ve never heard any magic like how their voices blend together).GOD. 4 of the original 5 lineup suffered immensely from their company\u2019s neglect in their pre-debut days (their dorms had no hot water, and at some point there wasn\u2019t even water because the pipe was frozen). They had no money and their only source of livelihood was their eldest (Joon Park)\u2019s minor earning. They debuted in 1999, and by 2006 the members went in separate ways but with a promise that they will reunite. In 2014, they kept that promise with their 15th anniversary concert. They had a few comebacks after that, and in early 2017 they had a tour too. This is their 18th year, with the exact line-up.I\u2019d say most 1st generation groups are really close. Most started from the bottom, and held each other tight as they rose to fame and were overworked by the company. Most groups went their separate ways because they wanted to pursue a different music career from the group\u2019s, but that wasn\u2019t allowed back then. Most 1st gen idols I\u2019ve seen have kept in contact with each other over the years. Another kind would be idols who started from small companies and eventually made it big. Groups like Infinite and BTS. Not only are they close with each other, they also share a closer bond with their CEO/producer and company staff. ",

I think Got7 mostly consists of chaotic people but they have their sweet times, while BTS mostly consists of sweet people but they have their chaotic times. I follow Got7 more so I will just talk about them (to add to the other replies here). In 2020, I can say that they still hung out a lot with each other outside promotion. Bambam, Jackson, Mark, Yugyeom hangout together for Jackson\u2019s birthday while Jackson was in Korea. Mark and Yugyeom hang out a lot because they live close to each other and recently finally Dalkyum (Yugyeom\u2019s very cute new puppy) meets Milo (Mark\u2019s dog)! And Yugyeom had dinner with Mark and his family when they visited Korea. Mark\u2019s family also visited JB\u2019s parents at their restaurant (I\u2019m so down for this Parents7 association). Oh and Yugyeom also had dinner with Mark\u2019s family when he went to LA earlier this year. Jinyoung has dinner together with Yugyeom while watching his newest drama. All of them still watch Jinyoung drama by themselves though. Well\u2026 except for Bambam who admitted that he already watched another drama that aired at the same time with Jinyoung\u2019s and promises that he will get to it after the drama is finished (and we all know how salty Jinyoung about this \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02). They are being totally supportive and never stop \u2018subtly\u2019 (or not so subtly\ud83e\udd23) promoting YoungJae who always wants to be a radio DJ in every radio shows that they visited until now YoungJae becomes the permanent DJ on Idol Radio. And I think YoungJae and JB are making music together because Youngjae updated an instastory at a studio that looks very much like JB\u2019s. Okay, I think I should stop my rant there or I will never stop. LOL. But yeah besides all of the tv shows and their Hard Carry reality shows, those small unfilmed interactions are the ones that convince me that these boys are real family outside the camera. Yes, they have members that are closer to each other more than the others, but don\u2019t you always have that closest brothers/sisters in your family? So there it is! ",

As you may know that exo doesnot really get the chance to do many activities like vlives , or tweets or many variety shows nor do they have a channel where they can post alot of videos together . Maybe it is cause of their agency but they dont get to do alot of content yet we can see from the reality shows or variety shows they do once , now and then that they are extremely close to each other . Normally when you are not very close to each other , you behave well with each other and talk politely but once you get close to each other , you joke around , make fun of each other , talk about stupid things , tease each other and that is exactly what exo does . Exo are actually one of the most honest kpop groups out there and that everyone agrees . When d.o gets annoyed of another member he just goes and hits them , telling them to stop . They annoy the shit out of each other just like brothers . You know real siblings ? Ya , that type of bond . They joke about things , take showers together , support each other\u2019s solo activities , kiss each other , hit each other , annoy each other , yet care about each other so much . They are close to the extend that people cant accept they are just friends , and keep saying they must be dating . Despite of not getting much screen time , whether it is in award shows or variety shows or travel shows that they do , their bond is so strong . Whether it is chanyeols mom coming to suprise d.o on his fan meeting ,or baekhyun and chanyeol found on trips and dates together by citizens ,or d.o cooking food for them all the time , or them saying that even though in the future if exo is not much popular but they want to call themselves members of exo , or them saying that even if they stay in sm or leave sm or start their own label but they will alwys be together , or sehun praying every night for his members, or members being super proud seeing sehun sing his rap parts , or baekhyun being loud af and joking around all the time getting hit by laughing chanyeol , d.o saying that he doesnot much fit in celebrity life and has thought about quitting lots of times but his members were the reason he wanted to stay ( and to people who dont know , d.o is known to be brutally honest about things and not sugar coat things , so he seriously meant what is said ) . Even members going to support each others solo activities like exo members went to baekhyuns candy inkigayo (even when chen was getting such hate from toxic people , he went to congratulate him ) . Even xiumin and chen have said in multiple occasions that they are just like a married couple , and all the members are always annoying and teasing the shit out of leader mama suho where suho has to always keep his calm and manage things around them . They are not in the limit of how friends are , cause friends are i love u , i thank u , sorry , e.t.c ,but they are in the zone of brothers where they annoy each other , dont keep any secrets , tease each others outfits and hair style , yet care more than any one about them , make each other laugh when they are sad , play lots of games and do gossip about things . They have had the deepest conversations with each other , cried with and for each other , been there at hard times , given each other life advices , and yet baekhyun reveals that sehun has a big nose and that kais armpit hair only grows on the lower side , chanyeol loving to bite baekhyuns butt and baekhyun biting sehuns butt all the time , suho and sehun subconciously always resting their hands on each others thighs , or chen whining suho to buy him things , or chen always roasting suho in shows saying that he is not funny ( by which i mean they dont act all nice to each other and polite cause they are like brothers ) . They hug each other and cling to each other , hit each other , laugh at and laugh with each other , make jokes , play lots of pranks ,eat , dance and sleep with each other . I cant say whether other groups are close or not cause i have not seen them offscreen but i can surely say that exo are darn it close to each other . You can see that they are not just close on screen cause if they had act to show people they are close they would be really sweet and nice to each other , or would compliment aech other about every single thing , say i love you or thank u to each other but they dont act so , they bully each other , tease each other , make fun , do pranks , hit each other , and yet kiss each other and hug each other whenever they are happy , smack each others butts , tear each others clothes so that fans can see the other persons body , share their wardrobe literally all the time and are just soooo comfortable with each othef all the time . They are themselves when they are together , so i can easily say that they are one of the most close kpop group out there . ",

            "answer_text": "Alongside BTOB, I would say Stray Kids. I\u2019m quite surprised no one has mentioned them but they are a rookie group so I understand. If you watch any of their videos you will see it right away. As for being on the survival show, they\u2019ve had members eliminated but then brought back later. JYP himself said that there was just something about having the nine of them together - their chemistry is undeniable. The leader of the group Chan trained for 7 years and has befriended many present and past JYP trainees, so it\u2019s no surprise that he\u2019s close with them. Having been there a for a long time, he\u2019s seen his friends debut without him, ultimately leaving him alone in the dorms. However, he had the chance to debut and picked the members of the group himself, which I think already shows that their bond must have been great. After winning a rookie award, Chan broke down (on VLive) and said that without Stray Kids, there is no reason for him to live. Skz is a group which largely writes and produces their own songs, so we know how important these lyrics are to them. In songs such as I Am You and My Side they talk about their bond and how they\u2019ve helped each other. The producing team 3RACHA write about a range of issues, most important here being depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. I think being able to articulate these feelings to another person and being able to write, compose and produce songs of these subjects shows how close and comfortable they are with each other. Also Jisung and Hyunjin have revealed they used to \u2018hate\u2019 each other and almost got to the point of having a physical fight. There\u2019s a whole video of them talking about this, and you can see how comfortable they are with each other now. They said that since they had seen each others\u2019 worst and weakest sides, they were able to get close faster with each other than anyone else in the group. The entire \u2018Two Kids Room\u2019 series is members talking about their relationships with each other, so it would be great to check out if you\u2019re interested. ",

            "answer_text": "BTS and B.I.G. Without doubt, there's also other groups with close members, by after watching sooooooo many videos about these two groups, I can easily come to the conclusion that the members of both groups are very close. BTS: All the members are close with each other. Period. I\u2019ll elaborate on a couple of their friendships, but I'll try not to bore you since I saw lots of other people also described BTS\u2019 relationships. Tae and Jimin. The obvious choice. These two even call themselves soulmates. They have been spotted doing things together, and their genuine friendship shines on stage. They\u2019re playful with each other, but you can see they truly care about one another. An example is when Tae was talking about his grandma after she passed away. Both him and Jimin were in tears, and Jimin came up to him and hugged him. Honestly these two are actual friendship goals Jimin and Jungkook. While Jungkook does tease Jimin about his height and such, they have a special relationship. A lot of moments about this relationship are more subtle. During the 4 Year Anniversary Stream, it was revealed that Jungkook only bought a gift for Jimin. Another example is in August 2016 when Jimin fainted and couldn't perform. Jungkook had to take over his parts. While singing, fans noticed that Jungkook\u2019s nose was red, as if he was crying. These are just two of the adorable, amazing relationships in BTS! If I had to describe all of them, I would be writing this for hours :) Now onto B.I.G! This group is definitely close. During Curtain Talk, which B.I.G\u2019s Benji was the MC for, they were fooling around the whole time and acting like best friends. There was no scripts either; it was genuine interactions between each other. I've also heard them use honorifics only a couple times, and I've seen nearly every video that has to do with them. If that doesn't show how close they are, then nothing does :D ",

            "answer_text": "Most of these are boy groups and that really annoys me, since half of the k-pop groups out there are girl groups! I\u2019ve been following some k-pop girl groups for some time and while you can notice that most of them have some internal issues (including Twice: it seems that Jihyo can\u2019t really stand the *gayness* of Nayeon and Momo), I\u2019ve noticed that girl-groups aren\u2019t as competitive as boy-groups and some of them have really amazing bonds, not only between the members of a particular band, but also with other groups too. With that being said, I will mention a few cases of girl-group friendship/bonds. EXID  EXID has been around for a long time, but they only become *famous* after their 4th\u20135th year together. From what I\u2019ve seen, they are all really dorky with each other but also very supportive. During this year\u2019s promotion, their main vocal (Solji) got sick and the rest of EXID decide to share the earnings of that promotion period with her (although she wasn\u2019t performing with them during that period!). Currently, Solji is still resting and getting better, but you can see her uploading pictures of the rest of the group, cheering them up and being really nice with them! Oh My Girl!  One of the most cute and lovable girl-groups has proven constantly that they are really close. I\u2019ve watched some episodes of Weekly Idol and in one of them, YooA and Binnie started crying and the rest of the band started hugging and taking care of them. This isn\u2019t something very usual between Korean girl-groups (most of them are really cold with each other), but that\u2019s not the case of OMG! I.O.I.  Although I.O.I was a temporary group (they were formed through a survival reality show on 2015 and disbanded almost a year ago), the bond that these girls created during their year together is really strong! All of them keep suppoting each other on their new groups and there are millions of pictures of them together behind the scenes! Some of them even had pijama-parties and it seems that their friendship is not only real but a very deep one! ",

            "answer_text": "I have to be biased and say\u2026 BTS. Runner up would be B.A.P, but it\u2019s sometimes hard for me to say how close they are since they don\u2019t seem as comfortable with cameras. BTS has always been hugely involved on social media so we see more of them. I have never, I mean never, seen a group of guys closer than BTS. Rap line has been living together for 7 years, and even Jimin who joined last lived with them for four-and-a-half years. Not only do they live together, they are forced to endure everything together. Aside from Jin, none of their families were rich. The company wasn\u2019t well-off either. There is something unique about growing up less privileged together, then slaving your a**es off together, then becoming an international sensation together that results in a unique bond. In a big company like YG or SM, there are dozens of trainees, and the competition is fierce. But if you train hard and long enough, you can be placed into a group with relative certainty. In a small company like BigHit, it\u2019s more close-knit and not as cutthroat, but the \u201cwhen will I debut\u201d question becomes even more agonizing when your company can only afford one group. So every person who made it into BTS knows that predebut struggle. You can see it now: every time they bring up predebut, all seven are thinking the exact same thing, of the exact same memories. Similarly, B.A.P is also from a small company and they struggled just as much as BTS, if not more. The fact that they all went through with the lawsuit together is a testament to their closeness. But in B.A.P the members are sort of separated, especially by age. In BTS Jin and Jungkook joke around like twins, Rap Monster mentors V, and they are generally such a team that you can\u2019t pick out any \u201cnot-as-close\u201d members. Only \u201cnot-as-into-public-skinship\u201d members. They are amazingly not-awkward with each other. I don\u2019t know how they do it, but I\u2019m sure their frequent dorm conversations and heart-to-heart talks play a part. Every video of theirs shows little details that prove how close they are: when they hype up each others\u2019 solos, when they share the prize of a game with the \u201closers,\u201d when they teach each other how to perform to their best, when they comfort each other crying agh I\u2019m getting emo now. I\u2019ll stop. ** CEO Bang: \u201cThere may be some artists who may have difficulty making their own decisions, but the members of BTS enjoy their independence.\u201d \u201c[I promised] that I would help them become an established team as a producer if they believe in the team\u2019s potential and do their best with their individual responsibilities.\u201d So they work hard as a team, which I think makes them particularly close.

            "answer_text": "I would have to go with BTS. Not only are they closest with each other but they are closest with their fans too. Deliberate constant lack of privacy, cameras recording their each and every move. From the maknae line deciding to play a silent game of hide and seek in the middle of the night while the hyungs are sleeping because they felt like it and then sharing the video with fans. Them crying, discussing their dreams, fears and criticism with each other without sugar coating any thing, in front of the camera. They are competative, honest, caring and close-knit so much so that even the fans know that Jin likes to cook, eat and feed others, Rapmon likes to go to a park alone to think, usually feels the weight of being a leader and Jimin consoling him, Suga is known to be savage and likes to be alone, he never hid his savage, dry but extremely caring and hardworking nature from the members or fans, Jhope aside from being the sunshine of the group can also make others cry if he starts to cry as the maknae line said. Well what to say about the three youngest members, they are the trouble makers, testing the patience of each other and their hyungs but so gentle inside that Jungkook, the youngest, dedicated his solo song to his Hyungs, Jimin is the guardian angel of the group, embracing the tearful, cheering the down, giving love to the needy members and checking chairs onstage before performance so no member gets hurt and when one of them slipped have a talk with the managers about the water on stage while V is the adorable koala bear usually seen riding the back of his members, trying to learn English from Rapmon and have such adorable 4D personality that even blundering through live programs the members can\u2019t do any thing other than to laugh openly, Rapmon as the leader to hide his blushing cheeks, Suga as the swag filled one distancing himself with such a disgusted expression as if he can\u2019t believe he is in a group with such idiots, but the next moment cheering Jhope on as if he is the best thing since sliced bred.

            "answer_text": "From what we see on screen I would say EXO, Super Junior, GOT7, Stray Kids and SHINee, just to name a few. For starters, EXO in general just seem like they\u2019re brothers in the way that they act around each other. It\u2019s very clear with the way that they tease and play around with each other that they\u2019re very close. As Xiumin and Chen said on a show they did together, they\u2019re like brothers from other mothers. With Super Junior, despite them always seeming to be arguing, it\u2019s quite obvious how close they are because as soon as any other group says anything that\u2019s even close to being insulting the others are immediately on the defense and helping out whoever it is that\u2019s being teased. It\u2019s like the sibling mentality of \u2018Only I can tease my siblings\u2019 GOT7 show that they\u2019re close through constant teasing of each other. The entire group is known to roast each other and have no mercy when it comes to outing anything about each other. However, they are known to look after each other very well and it\u2019s very clear how much they love each other. Despite Stray Kids still technically being a rookie group, it\u2019s very clear that they\u2019re all very close. It\u2019s a well known fact that they help each other with dancing, rapping and singing and are constantly hyping each other up when it comes to something that someone may not be very good at. Out of all the groups I\u2019ve mentioned I think that SHINee have the best bond. They\u2019ve been through some horrible, heartbreaking things together, but they came out of them with their bond being even stronger. Despite the fact that Key may want to hit Minho in the head from time to time, it\u2019s clear that they\u2019re like brothers as they protect each other. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I don't really stan that many groups, however it's safe to assume that most if not all kpop groups develop pretty strong friendships amongst themselves considering the time they spend together working hard to achieve their dream. However, here are some more details on the only 3 groups that I stan: BTS- Do I even need to explain this? Its no doubt they all love each other, their fans and their music. They've worked so hard and I'm so proud of them for coming from a small company, gaining popularity and success internationally and still staying so humble. Just watch them on American Hustle Life and you'll see how much their relationships have grown.GFriend- They come from a small company and each member has received some sort of specific hate. You can tell that they care for each other a lot and I'm sure that as the fandom grows, so will their love for each other (yes I know that was cheesy but it's true).Blackpink- Since most of their \u201chard working days\u201d were when they were trainees (not that they don't work hard now) and for the most part on their own (until they were actually put together as a group), you'd think that their relationships aren't as strong but hey: they love each other so much that they chose not to decide a leader so that has to count for something.So yah these are the only ones I know about that are pretty close but overall I'd say BTS is the closest because they've been through a lot together for a longer amount of time than GFriend and Blackpink but again, I'm pretty sure all groups become close overtime because its natural considering how much they do together.

            "answer_text": "I haven\u2019t searched up that much but I\u2019d say: BTS,Rainbow,Stellar,EXID,After School and 9Muses. If you want to know who is genuinly close just look at who\u2019s in contact after they disband. RAINBOW WENT ON A VACATION TOGETHER\u2026.After they disbanded.If that ain\u2019t proof that they want to be around eachother,I don\u2019t know what is. 9Muses members all showed up at the weddings of Hyuna and Sungah after they\u2019ve long left their company. After School members have done the same by showing up at Jung ah\u2019s wedding and Nana\u2019s birthday.A lot of the members aren\u2019t in the group anymore so again,there\u2019s nothing forcing them to pretend. Stellar post videos of hanging out together after they left the company and independantly organized a goodbye fan meet for their fans. EXID to me,seems pretty close both because of what they went through and how they act towards eachother.Still,only time will tell. BTS-Honestly,it\u2019s too soon to tell but it\u2019s a plus when other celebities list you as an example of a group that gets along.(Jessi) Final note:groups who aren\u2019t close are no less or more good from those who are.This is primarily their job.Idols don\u2019t join companies to find friends.They join them to make careers.Friendships are a bonus that some are lucky to get. There\u2019s also the fact that members could be genuinly close while the group is active and then life makes them distant but because kpop relies so much on manufacturing this image of friendship,you won\u2019t know when it is genuine.

            "answer_text": "B.A.P by a longshot. They filed a lawsuit against their company together. They waited until the youngest member of the group turned 18 to file together. Even through this lawsuit they stuck together as 6 and promised fans that they would stay together even after their contracts end. When their leader, Bang Yongguk, went on hiatus due to his deteriorating mental health they took over his spot until he got the help that was needed. After Yongguk\u2019s contract ended in August 2018 he assured fans that this wasn\u2019t the end of B.A.P and that he was always gonna be a part B.A.P even if, legally, he wasn\u2019t anymore. He even replied to one of his members tweets to be safe and to update him on the tour that they were doing without him after his contract ended. These boys genuinely care for each other and are so close that they consider each other as brothers. Now, not many kpop groups will admit to this in fear that fans will get offended but Yongguk once said that although he\u2019s thankful for his fans, he\u2019s more thankful towards his members. Awww. :\u2019)  This is one of the many reasons - and the strongest reason - why I love them and will remain a loyal fan. Through thick and thin we\u2019ll stay together as one. A lawsuit isn\u2019t gonna break us. Now that I know what we\u2019re capable of I know we\u2019ll only be stronger from here on out. We just have to trust them and I do. I\u2019ll be eagerly waiting for the day where they reunite as 6 without the bonds of their shitty company holding them back. Babyz will always be With You! :)  ",

Maybe its the huge number of members - 13 originally, plus 2 China Member - which kinda force them to adapt to different 13 personalities, needs, passions, and dreams\u2026 Maybe its the many dramas, ups & downs together during those times - huge accident(s), DUI cases, fights between members, members\u2019 contract termination, etc\u2026 Maybe its their families who also grew up together with them - its a widely-known facts that Suju members siblings often go for hangout together. Their sisters will go to wedding invitations on their place, together. Their parents taking care of all Suju members like they were all their own children.. Maybe its the challenges they faced as the one of the early K-pop boyband who went global - boy how different it was to be in 2007 and now. Back then, internet is a privilege, Youtube is not as big as now, social medias were just start-ups. Being a K-pop fans, you will receive this negative judgement from your friends and almost everyone considering K-pop as something of low quality. We were absolutely a minority.. I have to admit I am no longer intensely following reality/documentary show on newer groups but when you see Suju on any show, together, it is obvious that their bond is as close as family could ever be..

TWICE  I know that this group is genuinely close due to being on the survival show Sixteen. They shared a lot of laughter, tears, and overall bonding moments. This is my bias group so I know a lot about them, and their closeness is not acting. SEVENTEEN  Gotta love these guys! You can tell how close they are just by watching them interact with each other. The way the joke, hug, talk, and play around shows it all. Plus, Jeonghan even said that they were so close that the members could kiss each other (and even though the rest of the members protested the kissing part, you get the point of the statement) GOT7  This is a group that I got into from watching their show, Real Got7. If they were faking being close there than they\u2019re really good actors, because they seem like brothers rather than a group. Plus their most recent concept, 7 for 7, is about how close they are as friends, and how it\u2019s always gonna be all 7 of them or none. They even made a friendship necklace where each member has a piece and it forms the shape of their logo *i\u2019m not crying, you\u2019re crying*  (that\u2019s the necklace, if you were curious) Those are the ones that I know, but like I said at the beginning, there are probably plenty more that I just haven\u2019t gotten into yet.

And there's 9 of them. So I'll trim it down to two ladies who always seemed closer together than with the other members. Sana and Momo. They were born in the same year, so by Korean standards there was already the makings of a friendship. But they had that covered already\u2026  The two came to Korea \u201ctogether,\u201d which doesn't mean they were friends before training. They probably met right before and their friendship blossomed from the start. No doubt they were glad to find each other, being the only Japanese trainees as Mina came in much later. In that time they no doubt had to share some ups and downs. When Momo was eliminated from \u201cSixteen,\u201d Sana was shattered.  Theirs is a very loving relationship.  There's lots of shipping, but to be fair, these two give fans lots of ammo for that.  Lots of bickering too\u2026  But you know what they do that nobody ever talks about? They dress alike. All the time.  Momo goes online and teaches fans choreography. One time she brought in Sana to assist her (which Lead Dancers should do, but that's a debate for another question). Momo called her her \u201ctwin,\u201d leading gullible fans to even claim they were blood sisters for awhile. So, of course they dressed in exact track suits. I thought it was cute.  Then I started paying attention. This is what they do. It's not just that they share clothes. They all seem to do that. Like Sana and Tzuyu here:  I have two sisters. In my experience\u2026  \u2026females do that often. I'm not talking about that. I'm saying they dress alike. All the time.  Sometimes it's by accident. They don't sleep in the same room, they don't always know what the other is gonna wear that day. But they also plan it.  They vacationed in Hawaii together, without the other members. They dressed alike there.    Sana and Momo are today's picks. They are so close that even they think they're twins. ",

            "answer_text": "FT Island - They are too honest to the public especially to each other. They may look like they humiliate one another but that's one of the reasons why their bond is still very strong for more than 10 years. They may not live in one dorm anymore, but making music is what stick them together the most. They are just like their instruments. One should never be left out no matter what. When it comes to music, they are in sync. Their performances never fail to amaze fans. They rather spill the beans themselves than give the media the satisfaction of spreading the juicy news. Minhwan (their maknae) always loves talking about the band as 5. Hongki mentioned that no matter what, he will protect FT Island.   SHINee - Bromance doesn't bother them one bit. It's because they are very affectionate to one another. They all have big and soft hearts. Taemin and Jonghyun often miss having group activities everytime they do their solo activities. They always mention SHINee and the members. In the past, the older members always protect their maknae. The members return to Knowing bros because Jonghyun was 'bullied' by the cast. To make it short, they have each other's back. They may fight like cats and dogs but they are also ready to protect one another. I really don't need to say more, after all what SHINee had been through. They did their all to be whole no matter what untill the very end.   When a group has been together for more than 10 years, it's impossible they won't feel attach to one another. I'm not saying 10 years below won't feel like this. It's the fact that it's been 10 years working with one another. ",

            "answer_text": "I have looked around and I didn\u2019t see anyone mentioned Super Junior and Dong Bang Shin Ki, what a regret! These two groups are neighbors of each other since pre-debut, and their friendship is noisily famous and famously noisy (I know it\u2019s a weird collocation). DBSJ has a fandom named \u201cthe Pepsi fandom\u201d (it comes from the fact that pearl red color symbols DBSK and sapphire blue symbols SJ - that two colors will make the logo of Pepsi LOL). They released a song with 17 members named Show Me Your Love (this was covered by Seventeen). SJ Eunhyuk and DBSK Junsu studied in the same secondary school and had been best friends long before they were trained together (They even dressed as girls together in a festival - now that is embarrassing). SJ Kangin-Heechul and DBSK Yunho-Jaejoong were almost debutted under the name \u201cFour Seasons\u201d (though it was rumoured that the group immediately disbanded as they ate too much\u2026) DBSK Yunho (the leader) saved coins in a water container, and SJ Leeteuk (leader) admitted that he had stolen some money from him to buy food for his children (SJ members) in pre-debut days. They were trained together from their 10s to the official debut stage, and they had lived in the same dorm for those years. There are many famous cross friendships between the two groups like Hangeng-Jaejoong, Heechul-Jaejoong (still continues with Tony Hong and F.T.Island Lee Hongki), Changmin-Kyuhyun (the Evil Maknae duo)\u2026 Even recently, when they enlisted in the army, they still met one another. DBSK Jaejoong and SJ Leeteuk-Eunhyuk-Heechul have just bought apartments in the same condominium. There are so many many many things more to tell, but I can\u2019t remember them all. They are becoming ahjusshis LOL but their friendship will stay the same forever, I hope. Besides, the Shinhwa friendship is also awesome. Six members stayed together for almost two decades UNDER THE SAME NAME, and I guess, in their 40s now, they are becoming something more than just brothers. Recalling all these things has brought me to the verge of bursting into laughters and tears at the same time. ",

They have been through so much since their trainee days, and still are close to each other. Lay still keeps in contact with EXO when he is in China, Chan and Baek have considered each other best friends before, Sehun and Suho literal older brother-younger brother love, Chen and Xiumin must I say anymore? They are genuinely close, and many bts videos will give you a view on how close they are. The aura they give off onstage is that of a family, and when I went to their EXO\u2019rDIUM LA concert (2017) it was just like that. A family, Baek and D.O fighting. Sehun being shy while the other members manhandled him. An their proud faces whenever Sehun had his lines. I had clear view of Suho smiling like a proud father when Sehun was rapping during Monster. Their bond is genuine. MONSTA-X - Man these dorks. I love\u2019em so much. Anyways. They show off this family bond in their variety shows, and every where they go together. Their are like a big dorky family, and Hyungwon is he king of them lol. He\u2019s pretty much always judging them all tbh. SHINEE - I\u2019m not even going to say anything about their bond. If you really think their bond is not genuine how long have you been in Kpop? Have you ever even seen SHINEE? B.A.P - Honestly just watch them and you will see what I mean by genuine bond. JBJ, and definitely ASTRO. And most of the older Kpop groups I;e SNSD, SISTAR, BIGBANG, SUJU, TVXQ, etc. ",

I\u2019ll tell you a little from their pre debut stories. Jhope used to left the company when he was a trainee and he said in the Burn The Stage (their docu-series on Youtube Red), he came back because of the members. because he trusts them. and RM said (when Jhope decided to left the company), that they can\u2019t do well without him (Jhope). they need him to do well.Jungkook got offered by 7 agencies (if I\u2019m not mistaken) and some of them are big in Korea, but he decided to go to Bighit which is a small company back then because he heard RM\u2019s rap.Jin is coming from a well-living family but he used his allowance to buy food to eat with the members.these are just some stories they\u2019ve shared. and honestly, their bond with each other is like a family. you can see this if you watch their videos on BangtanTV or their Vlive Channel or just literally their \u201cbehind the scene\u201d videos.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to go with BTS, Stray Kids, and GOT7. These are the boy groups, and I can vouch for them because I know how much of a close relationship they have. I won\u2019t be discussing BTS and GOT7 because people have already explained it, but I will go on for Stray Kids. Stray Kids members were chosen by the leader, Bang Chan himself, and weren\u2019t put in a random lineup by JYP. Furthermore, they went through a survival program to debut as the 9 (original members, Woojin left the group later on). Two members were eliminated in the process- Felix and Lee Know. JYP thought that as this 7 member lineup, they were perfect, but he also felt that their chemistry on stage and charisma was better as 9, so he gave Felix and Lee Know another chance. The members worked extra hard to put up their best stage as 9, and debuted as 9. You can see the love they have for each other. They bicker a lot, and are really close. As for girl groups, there\u2019s Red Velvet, and TWICE. Blackpink, also, to some extent, but that cannot be very strongly vouched for due to the lack of content. I\u2019d like to summarize this by saying that most groups would be very close to each other, but these groups I listed are the ones that I can say for sure are super close. ",

            "answer_text": "I was going through all the answers and was surprised that no one mentioned this gem of a group who resurrected their own career from the ashes, after being neglected by their own company. If any group that first comes to my mind for being genuinely close to each other, then it is\u2026. NU'EST  Explosive hit debut? Mismanagement by company? Failure after hitting rock bottom? Rise of career from the ashes to becoming one of the top boygroups in Kpop today? This group has seen it all. Its no surprise to Kpop fans that every year hundreds of groups debut, but only a handful of them actually manage to make it big and have a respectable career in this cutthroat industry. And if you come from a small company? Your probability of not making it big multiplies by manifold. NUEST debuted in 2012 under Pledis Entertainment with the hit title track \u201cFace\". This MV is one of the most viewed debut MVs in Kpop of all time, garnering 110M+ views till date. It even peaked at No.15 on the MelOn chart in 2012, an impressive feat for rookies.  (They debuted way too young. 4 boys were 16 at the time, being 95-liners, and 1 member was 18 in age, being 93-liner) However\u2026\u2026 Things started going downhill. Pledis entertainment shifted the focus of NU'EST from Korea, to international shores of China and Japan in their rookie years itself. This was a grave error, which they eventually realised later on, but by then it was too late. These international ventures in the group's rookie years stunted their potential growth of a stable, loyal fanbase in Korea, as a result they lost majority of their fandom in Korea. And to add on, they had long hiatuses between each Korean comeback, which worsened the situation. As a result, this reflected in their sales. Even after 4-5 years of being active in the industry, NU'EST sold only about 500-600 copies of their albums!! . . . In 2017 the group made a decision that would eventually go on to change the course of their career forever. 4 out of 5 of the NU'EST members participated on Season 2 of the hit survival show of Mnet Produce 101. (Kang Dongho, Kim Jonghyun, Choi Minki, Hwang Minhyun) All of them are 95-liners.  But it was not easy. These days many debuted group members give a shot at making it big on the show, but back then it was practically unheard of for a 5 year old active idol boygroup to downgrade themselves to the status of trainees and compete on a \u201ctrainee survival show\". They got accused of \u201ccheating\" since they apparently already had a fanbase; had to swallow their pride and even say it clearly on camera that even their company had given up on them. It was their last shot at saving their group from disbandment. And it was their own decision to take this last chance for saving the group. Their gamble and hardwork did pay off. All 4 members reached the top 20 in the finale. 3 of the members gained massive popularity during the course of the show (Kim Jonghyun, Kang Dongho and Hwang Minhyun). And one member (Hwang Minhyun) made the cut to Wanna One. Miraculously, while the show was still airing, all of NU'EST old albums were reportedly sold out at a number of major sites! And many of their old songs reverse-charted after years on Korean Music charts. Their 2013 song \u201cHello\" even became eligible for a 1st place win on Inkigayo after 4 years!! . This is a feat that has till date never been repeated by any idol group on Produce 101. . While Minhyun promoted with Wanna One, the remaining 4 members promoted as the massively popular subunit NU'EST W for the time. NU'EST W topped domestic charts with every release and made a successful name for themselves in the Kpop market. Their first ever career music show win came with \u201cWhere You At\" in 2017 (after just 9 days of song release). . NU'EST W released hits like If You, Where You At, Dejavu and Help Me, etc. that topped MelOn and all Korean charts right on release! . From the boys who once couldn't sell even 100 tickets for their fanmeeting, were able to sell out 10,000 seats right-off-the-bat after Produce 101 massive popularity, as NU'EST W, with about 200k people still waiting online for tickets lol. (Hence rightfully called \u201c reversal icons \" of Kpop).  . (From selling barely 600 albums in 1st week to 220,000+ albums in 1st week, NU'EST certainly came a very long way) . After the disbandment of Wanna One, Minhyun came back to complete his original group, and NU'EST got their first full group win with \u201cBet Bet\" in 2019. The group sold out a 3 day concert at KSPO Dome (Olympic Gymnastics Park). Selling out this arena is a mark of huge status of popularity for any group, and by selling out the KSPO Dome for 3 nights with 36000 total capacity, NU'EST reinstated their status as a top boy group in Korea today.  (Above) NU'EST W first ever solo concert (Double You) 2018  (Above) NU'EST Ot5 1st solo concert (Sold out for 3 days) at KSPO DOME. (Segno) 2019 . Their accumulated album sales have crossed 1.2 Million+ sales till date officially making them a MILLION SELLER GROUP according to Gaon (only 12 groups have achieved this status in the past 13 years), and getting Platinum-certified album with every comeback. . . . These 5 boys have went through a lot. They have seen extreme ups and downs throughout their career, yet they held their ground and stayed together through everything. They did not disband, and successfully broke the 7 year curse of Kpop. The only group to get a full group first win after contract renewals!! And that too after their 7 year anniversary. They have expressed it themselves that they wish to stay together for a long time, like Shinhwa and H.O.T. . . I cannot say much about other groups, but when it comes to NU'EST they are genuinely one of the closest groups out there. Their whole rollercoaster of a journey is testimony to this fact.  ",

            "answer_text": "SHINee , VIXX and Got7 , in my opinion . SHINee - They've been together as a group for almost 10 years and they're very open with their friendship . Minho and Key even admitted that they hated each other in the beginning and they wouldn't have said that if they truly think of themselves as best friends now . Even with the recent onew scandal , all four of them have always mentioned that they'll come back with onew , even though many people want onew to leave the group . (My opinion on the onew case is another story ) If you're a shawol who keeps track of their whereabouts , you'd know that the members always make sure to attend each other's concerts/shows whenever they can. Lastly , it's not easy to last 10 years but they've done it and you can see how their friendship has grown over the years . VIXX - Watch absolutely any vixx video qnd you'll see their bond . Even when the members are picking on the leader , they make it very clear that nobody but the VIXX members can bully N . N is also always looking out for the members and making sure to teach them wherever he can . GOT7 - Do I have to even explain this ? ",

            "answer_text": "I know this is an old post but I have to mention this one girl group. First I\u2019ve been a twice fan for some time now and always considered them to be one of the closest bonds. Their interactions just doesn\u2019t seem forced. But then I found a group that\u2019s unbeatable imo. Take a look at fromis_9. God their chemistry with each other can\u2019t be faked imo. You know how when someone does an aegyo in the group, the other group members of the group make encouraging comments like \u201coh my thats so cute\u201d or sumthing. Fromis don\u2019t do that. They straight up insult their team member by constantly imitating them. For example Nagyung likes to do aegyo and members like Jiwon and Chaeyoung often makes mocking impersonations of her. Of course inviting Nagyung to attack them physically lol. Then there\u2019s the time when Gyuri decided to be avante garde during a live show and sang her introduction by singing a hello song. Other groups would respond by saying \u201cthat was great, love that\u201d. Not in fromis_9. Gyuri\u2019s hello song gets imitated very often as a joke among the members vlives. Gyuri often tries to make her intros in live show with cute lines. Only to be responded by members hiding their faces, face palming lol the members really are a bunch of haters hahaha. Or that time Jiwon sings G3 instead of G6. So many I can\u2019t list them all out. All in all, you don\u2019t do such insults if ur not close. Because ur scared to offend the other person. But I don\u2019t see beef at all at fromis_9. They will insult one another light heartedly and I hope the continue doing so. It just makes them more genuine in my opinion. ",

            "answer_text": "So I basically follow lot of bands. But the ones that seemed genuinely close were Bts and Seventeen and Monsta X. Everyone knows why BTS. So I am not going to elaborate on that. But bc they have gone through hardships together, they are extremely close. Seventeen because they have been together since most of the members were just 15\u201316. Friendships in these young, formative years counts a lot and goes a long way. From their interactions, the little gestures thar you see them do in the background( it just can\u2019t be scripted). They seem genuinely warm and caring towards each other.  And Monsta X because obviously they were trainees together. But more than that it is extremely obvious that they are close to each other. And as per my understanding none of it seems scripted. Like Shownu giving his part to Hyungwon and sharing the money that he earned individually. All members cheering each other all the time. Kihyun had mentioned in an interview that when we get calls from our other idol friends and when we tell them that we are doing something together, they always tell us that Monsta X is always together. They added that we go out to eat together and shop together I am sure in front of the camera they portray their best selves but the way they talk and behave makes it easy to know that they are very close.  P.s they are not posing here. They are celebrating Wonhos bday. It\u2019s photo clicked by a fan. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a lot I could point out, but lately\u2026 All I can think of is Hotshot. They have been through so much together, y\u2019know.. being an underrated group. They were popular pre-debut cuz they posted covers without the company\u2019s knowing, but after debut\u2026 It was hard for them to gain the popularity they had in pre-debut. After around 1 year, they went on a 2 year hiatus due to the company\u2019s debt and loss of staffs. Last year, they almost gave up, but they kept finding ways, on their own, to get more recognition for their group. Then an opportunity came. Taehyun and Sungwoon grabbed the chance to participate in Produce 101. If you have watched PD101 and saw how desperate Sungwoon was and how Taehyun didn\u2019t cry for his own elimination, but cried for Sungwoon when he got announced as the 11th member\u2026 That kind of support and desperation is the same level as the rest of Hotshot\u2019s support and desperation for their group. Yoon San also went to SMTM 6 but he wasn\u2019t aired. And these Interviews here.. \ud0dc\ube5b on Twitter \u2026 \ud0dc\ube5b on Twitter explains their support for each other no matter what. Sungwoon, now a member of Wanna One, mentioned Hotshot saying \u201cTake care of Hotshot while I\u2019m not there\u201d. Ha Sung Woon shares his reaction to HOTSHOT's comeback without him | allkpop.com But due to issues, there aren\u2019t many videos to show how close they are. And some members are more on the quiet side. But since their comeback, they have been going to interviews like those and they were finally able to speak their minds. But AGAIN, I had other groups in mind and I agree with the other comments, but Hotshot popped up first in my head XD ",

            "answer_text": "in my opinion, i would say Stray Kids. they're technically still a rookie group and we probably haven't seen enough of them yet to call them very close, but from what I've seen from being a stay for quite a long time, i can really tell that every member has a strong bond with each other and their relationship are genuine. Stray kids had kinda a rough time to be able to debut together. that was their goal anyway, to debut as nine. when Minho and Felix got eliminated during the show, the members cried really hard and constantly hugged each other. they constantly practice with each other and im sure that they teach each other their dancing,rapping and singing. chan genuinely cares for the members, he always does his best to look out for the members and when their teasing each other, he always try to not go too far in case he hurts the member's feelings. Stray kids members are close until they'd fucking look at each other in the eyes when they shower lmao. but that isn't the point just wanna say that Stray kids are really close and watch their videos like talker or the survival show, you can really see their bond is real and they love each other like a family.

You cannot and will not see anything \u2018genuine\u2019 as a fan. AS much as you try to be unbiased and objective, your imagination will runaway from you. Kpop is a terribly competitive world that is deeply rooted in public appeal above all else. What you see is what they want you to see. At the end of the day, it is a business and this is their job. That\u2019s their livelihood. each trainee in a group is willing to give their all and expects the other trainees to do so as well.They expect the other person to want it as bad they want it. That is the foundation of their friendship. They will respect each another for that core reason. But if your asking if they would consider themselves \u2018family\u2019 or a \u2018brotherhood/sisterhood\u2019. Then no. You will get genuine friendships like jin and ken or changmin and kyuhyun. Once you factor in that they didn\u2019t have a choice in their members and that their livelihood relies on their joint success. The word \u2018genuine\u2019 cannot be applied. ",

            "answer_text": "I honestly feel like most K-pop groups are genuinely quite close. You train with the others for many years before debuting, and you have to go through a lot together to make it as a group. Besides, companies make sure that the trainees are agreeable and friendly with each other before the group debuts. If they aren\u2019t close, the only other chance they have to make friends would be with the staff or other idols, since they don\u2019t have time to interact with anyone else. Idol groups live together and are literally never without each other - they sleep in the same rooms, they train for dances together, they perform at concerts together, they go to variety shows together, and one group apparently bathes together.  There are a lot of inter-group friendships as well, although the male idols seem to have an easier time making friends with other idols because companies like to pit female idols against each other for whatever reason. Some of the closest groups, though, would probably be 1st and 2nd generation groups - simply because they\u2019ve known each other for such a long time. ",

These 6 (formerly 7 :\u201d() came from a small company so they weren't really well known. They worked really hard and if you just suddenly decided to watch a video from their shows like Sesame Player you can see just how close they are. Like I can't even explain but it's like this - they lived together, trained together, laughed together, just a bunch of funny crap they grew up together like family.  Damnit I miss Hoya. :\u201d( Okay I'm not going to bother explaining since I can't really explain but I'll list off some. Literally all you would have to do is watch one of their variety shows or real lif shows or something and you'd be able to tell exactly how close they are. BTS - again from a small company.

Instead of fighting for their group\u2019s freedom they would just brush off BEAST and let it be something in the past. BTOB has been around for 5 years, struggling with being popular and unknown, and now they\u2019re starting to rise again on top without leaving a single member. Pentagon may be just a one year group, but I don\u2019t doubt their closeness, because they have hella lots of skinships, and they have overcome member\u2019s elimination (they are formed from Pentagon Maker). Other groups that I feel are genuinely close are BTS, Apink, and GOT7. ",

You can say all you want about BTS but they are all so close and there\u2019s no uncomfortable interactions between them, they\u2019re genuinely very close and love each other. People don\u2019t speak about SVT a lot but even with 13 members, they all get along so well and they have so much fun together. They genuinely care and love each other and they act like brothers, it\u2019s so endearing to watch. Being a 5 year old group already and still living together shows how amazing their relationship is. Also we can\u2019t leave GOT7 behind on this because they have one of the most amazing relationships ever. They\u2019re all so close and they look so comfortable around each other, they\u2019re always laughing and being silly just like high school friends and it\u2019s adorable. Honorable mention to MonstaX(OT7) and Stray Kids(OT8): I don\u2019t stan, i\u2019m just a casual listener but when i see them together you can tell they are friends and their interactions are so natural and genuine, really really cute.

            "answer_text": "Definitely MAMAMOO. Wheein and Hwasa have been friends since young and went to Seoul at the same time and even debuted in the same group. Solar and Moonbyul are very close. They always bicker but they love each other. If you watch behind the scenes (mmmtv) you can tell they get along very well and all of them are very hyper. They support each other a lot . For their solo debuts they always send coffee trucks, cakes and even refrigerators to each other. They love each other a lot and Solar cries when she thinks of how she scolded them in the past and couldn't apologise for it. The members understand she was a kid too when she became a leader. That time when Hwasa didn't wear a bra at the airport and was interviewed about it? Mamamoo who usually are awkward and hesitant to answer questions immediately jumped in to defend Hyejin. The bond between them remind me of sisters. ",

Above All, there's no way they could be this weird together if they weren't genuinely close :D    ",

And no drama ever happens ( that we see ) between them. 2 of the members Jimin and Taehyung have been best friends sense high school. And they said they are practically soulmates. Also they have all known each other for many many years, before BTS debuted. And all 7 of them still live together. They could choose to live alone and do whatever the fuck they want but they still choose to live together and they said that they hate to think about when they won\u2019t live together . They all know each other so well and is basically that one friend group at school that everyone knows about cause they are funny asf when together. And I could go on and on about this but I will just leave it at that ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it's really hard to say because we dont really know what goes on off camera. Even so, i definetely think older groups have a very strong bond amongst the members. For example, Super Junior. They've been together for over a decade and they have stated many times before that they are like brothers. Of course this could be mostly helped with the fact that they've been together for many years. In those years of course many things have happened and all of them had been through so much. In their recent fanmeet ( D&E ) on of the members said that the members moved out of the dorm but still live in the same apartment building. Another kpop act would definetely be TVXQ. Their bond is like a married couple. They're always there for each other and support each other. Ill go have my long tvxq and suju hours now. ",

Suga and RM have been living together for over seven years, and all of the other members have been living together since predebut. I cannot say that I\u2019ve seen a group with closer members than BTS. Next, I would say GOT7. The entire group has extreme personality and I truly love them. It\u2019s quite clear that the members love each other as well, they are so comfortable with each other. They are ready to confess their love or diss each other so badly, but it\u2019s all in good fun and in the nature that they aren\u2019t just joined together because they are in the same band from the same company.

They might had been awkward at debut due to the fact that they were put to work together in short notice, and that they had trainee friends that they\u2019d rather work with than these \u201cstrangers\u201d. However, time has homogenized their relationship. Gone were the extreme emotions, replaced with a warm family like relationship. They have been working together almost everyday for 9 years. They silently show support for other members pursuing solo acivities. They frequently hang out together as shown on Key\u2019s instagram. They make fun and tease one another on and off stage. I believe SHINee members are legit close. ",

For 2nd Generation groups, BEG and Sistar are probably groups with a close relationship between members. 3rd Gen girl groups have a lot of close members but the ones that really stand out are groups such as Apink, EXID and Mamamoo. EXID is a great example of friendship over work, listening to stories about how they try to keep the positive mentality during the group\u2019s 3 year hiatus and I would say they have the most natural chemistry among groups I encountered so far. They are basically like the friends you\u2019ve always wanted kind of group. Mamamoo is basically the same but at times over the top with fan service but still they have a very close knit relationship. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a lot of groups repeated, so I\u2019m going to mention Winner. A lot of people know Winner\u2019s songs but not as much the artists themselves. Winner recently had a comeback with a full album called EVERYD4Y, with the 4 to represent their members. Their debut album was 2014 S/S, and after that in 2017 they released their bops REALLY REALLY, and LOVE ME LOVE ME. It might seem that in writing, their schedule seems normal. However, in reality, they had a long hiatus for 1 year and 2 months. This was when Song Mino entered Show Me the Money. Why, you may ask? Although today Winner is composed of 4 members, Kang Seungyoon, Song Mino, Lee Seunghoon, and Jinwoo, they had a fifth member, Nam Taehyun. Initially, it was said that Taehyun was leaving the group and YG for mental health reasons. Taehyun also created his own band, South Club. There are numerous groups who had members with health issues or other outside problems that lead to them unable to go on with promotions. Especially after WIN, and their debut, WINNER was an incredibly hot group. I believe WINNER is one of the closest groups because of their long hiatus. They could\u2019ve carried on with more promotions and such, but instead of leaving Taehyun, they chose to endure a long hiatus. Not only that, but they trained tirelessly during WIN, and even before that. WINNER also self-composes and choreographs. In order to do this, they have to spend a lot of time together\u2026 but not only working\u2026. XD  ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a very difficult question to answer. Since all of the members are trained before they come up as a group that\u2019s why their bonding is usually already strong. Another thing is that just by looking at few videos one can not say about how they treat each other 24/7. As far as I have noticed in every group there are few members who are closer to each than the rest of the members of the group. Like GD and Taeyang have confirmed a lot of times that they have been friends since childhood. If you talk about the friendship between all the members of a group I think SUPERJUNIOR and SHINEE have the advantage of being together from past more than 10 years so they are obviously close to each other. Whereas the newer groups like BTS, GOT7 and SEVENTEEN also seem quite understanding towards the other members of the groups. I have not followed girls\u2019 kpop band much so I can\u2019t tell about their close friendship. ",

A good rule of thumb: the higher they are, the harder they\u2019ll fall. In the end, KPop fans will face the hard truth that their idol\u2019s fame is also their eventual downfall. They\u2019ll witness the disintegrating \u201cfriendship\u201d. They could have been genuine friends as they climbed to the pinnacle of success, but once they reach their goals (or most of their goals), it\u2019s good bye friendship, hello cha ching! The first contract renewal is usually fine, smooth-sailing. Unless they got a slave contract, because that\u2019s a whole lot of chaos before the renewal happens. IF there will even be a renewal. The videos of your stans and ships being all sweetness lovey-dovey or adorably \u201cfighting\u201d? Don\u2019t trust the content, darling. It\u2019s not a Kpop industry for nothing. Everything\u2019s manufactured for the clients\u2019 satisfaction. In case you\u2019re being delightfully obtuse, YOU are their client/customer/fan/follower. You want the friendship and family narrative special? They got it for you. Don\u2019t delude yourself that all\u2019s genuine though. ",

They support each other although they also argue a lot. The members support Shindong and let him borrow money to so he can start his business. Donghae always say that they only have each other and shouldn\u2019t argue. They grew up and matured together and I feel they know how their members truly feel without having to actually say it. Secondly, I want to mention BTS. According to Dispatch, when they try to find if Jongkook is dating anyone, they find that he is always hanging out with another bandmate so they are probably very close to each other too. ",

And yet was able to elevate their status as the KINGS And GODS of kpop of this generation. No kpop groups will be able to withstand what BIGBANG had experienced throughout the years. But still up to this date they had been together even on their military service, going strong and bold to face those critism. They help and lift eact other together .T his is real friendship! ",

Both groups stuck together through really trying times (Seventeen having to deal with an almost-bankrupt agency, BTS coming from BigHit) and you can really see that in the way they interact with each other. The members have a really genuine bond and care a lot about each other (both groups have continually said they hope to continue dorming together for a long time). Most of the members of Seventeen have known each other for several years before their debut, so the bond is natural. BTS and Seventeen are both families. ",

Well you can see it crystal clear that they are have that strong bond with each other, it isn't easy to protect a whole group for a really long period but shinhwa did, if you watch their variety show you can see it through their eyes and how they acted to each other, and for BtoB.. Weird friends are destined to have weird friends as well, and the bond between them are ridiculously tight, i could see it from the moment they support each other back, when peniel became bald, the members really cared for him not only in front of camera but behind as well ",

They have been together for a really long time and they are still the same after so many years. It's not only friendship between them but also business. I really admire that they are still so close. Anyways, for girl groups I have Apink. They are pretty much sunbaes to a lot of groups now and it's touching and rare to see members being so considerate of each other. ",

Mark, Jackson, BamBam, and Yugyeom knew each other before they joined Got7. JB and Jinyoung knew each other because they debuted as \u201cthe JJ Project\u201d be joining. ",

Like how they make fun of Peniel's head. Also, Sungjae's cat is everyone's cat haha ",

I have done research of what they were up to when they had a 1 year and 9 months hiatus. Apparently they would hang out together off camera and the public eyes, and when it's one of the members' birthday, they would gather for a secret birthday party just the the 6 of them. Daehyun also revealed that during their hiatus, he got a tattoo \u201cbest absolute perfect\u201d on his back. You can read this: B.A.P's Hiatus: Warriors in the Dark No one really cared when they were in their darkest times, apparently their fans started moving to bts, and exo, and other groups. One fan even posted a tweet saying, \u201csorry b.a.p. but I'm moving on\u201d ",

They\u2019re legitimately like family. They have been through so much together. I would expect them to break up but no, that stay together. Imagine how hard it would be to stay together after losing a member like that because you\u2019d have to do promos, perform old songs and choreo, still be in h Th e spotlight and get asked questions, etc. I tend to run from my problems and try not to think about a person because it hurts too much. Honestly I have so much respect for them and I love all the members. ",

Whenever one cries, another is always comforting her. They went through a lot together so I would say they\u2019re one of the closest girl groups there is. They might have not gone through a survival show or anything together, but the amount of time the trained together for really beats the concept of bonding just through a survival show. ",

They support each other, they will know if one of their member a bit down, and automatically filling it in. They diss each other comfortably and without shame in any radio show or vlive (goodbye script). Remember when Jinyoung argue with Jackson for not inviting him to his parents house in HK in the middle of chic interview. And jackson ask Jy if he misses the group when he is shooting for drama. The whole members are soft for each other like brothers. I cant explain well, just see for yourself. ",

The love they hold for each other is so heartwarming, and though I don\u2019t stan, my heart broke when Pentagon were saying goodbye to Jinho, who was about to enlist back then. The tears they shed were too real to be fake. This was more than a performance to attract people, more than a performance to get pity votes. It was a performance Pentagon planned out just to say goodbye to their oldest member, in which that performance would be his last stage with the group for a long time. It was a performance that was genuine, one that showed their whole heart. They truly love each other, and just one performance can show that. ",

They can cheer each other up no matter what. The group seems incomplete without any one of the members and shine brighter when they're together. All of them love finding any way to mention another one of their members or their groups even if they're doing an individual interview. The amount of love they show for one another is amazing. ",
