            "answer_text": "Right now YouTube is very jumpy on fan-covers when they used to very accepting. This was often cool as the original artist would sometimes get involved in liking a cover. It was very win-win and enjoyable for all as in reality, the covers advertised/sold the \u201creal\u201d version for the official artist. Nowadays it feels like everything gets pinged the moment it goes up. This is a mighty tricky one as in some countries a person is always allowed to perform a cover of any song. Otherwise, ownership of that song becomes a bit of a monopoly when another person can\u2019t sing it and earn money from said performance. If you are a Wedding Singer then being deprived of the right to sing the Eagles \u201cHotel California\u201d or ABBA \u201cDancing Queen\u201d constitutes deprival of income - for no greater good seeing that those songs are \u201cpublic\u201d (hearable already and likely in the situation seeing they are commonly on the radio). This assumes that Royalties will go back to the song owner/creators via venue licensing. While I understand the logic that a song owner can say no, I don\u2019t like that being done, it is not positive for the world that only the Eagles can ever sing \u201cHotel\u201d. Esp seeing that some people do get to do covers. Once it becomes only some it is smelling like stand-over. YoutTube seems to be supporting that practice. The problem with YouTube, and most similar providers at the moment, is that they are just running scared so there have been plenty of cases where it is easier to hit the \u201ccan\u2019t do that\u201c option even if that in itself is a breach of fairness (and I am not talking about twisted attempts at fair usage to do a dodge). What to do: that is where it is tricky. Some covers you can post and they will be totally canned immediately (eyes Eagles songs - despite their being covers & derivative works on YT). You can\u2019t do anything but move on. I put my \u201cHotel California\u201d fan-cover on Facebook who seems happy to respect the intent in the situation.Some covers will get a note immediately saying that if monetized, any noise will go to the Song owner but the video can still be shown with no limits. This is not entirely fair but a workable solution in the short term. Hope for one of these.The problem with the latter is that technically my cover of A Flock Of Seagulls \u201cI Ran\u201d is my performance (dubious tho it might be) and I deserve to get paid for that. There is no provision for my part in that equation as YouTube will give the song owner monies made from my performance as though it were their own. That is stealing to prevent stealing. My Plugged-In Bach versions were canned at first even tho the compositions are public domain and my performances were mine. Sony seemed eager to handle my money even tho they hadn\u2019t signed me. That got fixed. If you are signed with a label and all the correct boxes have been ticked when your cover is released then your cover will return monies to all the right places. ",

            "answer_text": "Carl is correct but be careful if you plan on monetizing the video. (Monetizing a video is when you allow ads to be played in your video and then you make profit from the ads). Check out the Michelle Phan lawsuit here:  Michelle is a makeup artist and she was using major artist\u2019s music in her videos. These weren\u2019t covers, these were the original songs. However, when you are making profit from videos with a cover, you run the risk of getting sued because you still need a license to make money from song covers. You can record a cover with no problem, but once sales are generated from content that includes covers, you still need a license. Licenses are usually obtained from the Harry Fox Agency. So if you were to monetize your video with a song cover in the video, and your video gets really popular, you could have a problem on your hands. The record industry is hungry for money and they usually wait until something gets really popular before they sue. It\u2019s best to allow content to hit its peak of sales before placing a lawsuit because legal battles are expensive. So if you plan on making sales of any kind from the video, I\u2019d say get a license to use the songs or don\u2019t use them at all. Hope this helps. RetailClips.com ",
