            "answer_text": "Here is my answer which is also commentary on the subject: If you want to understand the lyrics to a song, look for them on the Internet (not meaning to say that in an insulting manner, more like pointing out something you may not have thought of to do). Listen to the song and follow along with the lyrics. As you do this, your brain will start to be able to pick out the words until you don\u2019t need the lyrics printed out. That being said, there are many bands in the more extreme sub-genres of metal that don\u2019t even try to enunciate the words that they are theoretically singing. The good thing about these bands is that by doing this, they have told you that their thoughts and emotions mean so little to them that they don\u2019t convey them in a way that is comprehensible to their own fans, and you can just disregard them. If you are following a song with the lyrics printed out and you can\u2019t identify what grunt, shriek, fart, belch, etc. is supposed to be the part where they speak their truth to power, just move on. They don\u2019t care and neither should you. Similarly, if you see a band logo and it looks like a bundle of sticks with no resemblance to the words that theoretically comprise the bands name, you can safely assume they are so ashamed of their music that they don\u2019t want people to associate it with them, and therefore you don\u2019t need to give them any attention either.

            "answer_text": "In a lot of Heavy Metal; especially the \"cookie monster\" vocals; the voice is treated like another instrument.  It's not really used to convey verbal context as much as raw visceral human power.  They, of course, add words since that sounds cooler than just screaming \"RRRRRAAAAAAAA!!!\" the whole time, but the context of the words isn't as important as the \"oomph\" behind the presentation thereof.   That's not to be said of all metal of course.  Bands like Symphony X, Evergrey, Motionless in White and many others often scream and growl but yet still have good voices that carry textual meaning as well as musical.  But the really heavy growly stuff; just let yourself hear it and feel it instead of trying to listen and understand it.  Less cerebral.  More primal. ",

            "answer_text": "I like some metal, some I don't. I like all kinds of music, but there's a trend of shock effect dating back to KISS and Cooper, that lives on today and keeps trending towards more shocking and more bizarre, faster, heavier, louder, and screamier, not necessarily more musically talented. I'm sure there is talent there, but I'm not looking for it, because I just can't get into it. You want musical talent look no further than Pat Methany. If you want talent in metal I wouldn't be able to help you past Tool. I quit paying attention because most of those bands literally became a parody of themselves. Some will say it's an acquired taste, but what they really mean is that they have desensitized themselves to noise,  and this is coming from  someone who grew up on punk and metal(Anthrax, Fear, Pantera, Fugazi, Prong, VoiVod, SubHumans, COC, etc.).... ...I can't get into  a lot of this new stuff for exactly the reason you state: All I hear is noise. ....but then again, I am no longer an angry teenage boy with too much testosterone. Here's a hint, if you don't like it, then leave it at that... ...forcing yourself to like something because other people do doesn't make you cooler, it only makes you fake. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are just starting out with heavy metal,I don't think Napalm Death is the right band for you as their music is comparatively more abrasive as compared to other heavy metal bands. It is difficult to understand screamed/growled vocals for a beginner and you just need to treat them as another instrument like say an electric guitar with a lot of distortion.What I would  suggest you is ,start out with the classic metal bands like Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden,Metallica,Megadeth which are comparatively melodic and easier to get into (catchy?) . Then work your way up towards the heavier bands like Slayer, Pantera ,Lamb of God and Napalm Death as you would be slowly  but steadily getting the feel of the harsh vocals.Watch a few documentaries about the history of heavy metal(Sam Dunn's documentaries are a must watch) and I'm sure you will appreciate the genre a lot more. Happy listening :) . ",

            "answer_text": "growling and/or screaming as used in metal is three things: not actual screamingan aquired tastehard to understand unless heavily used to itthe thing is, unlike in pop music, the vocals in such cases are more concerned with sound instead of being understandable (though there are some bands were you can easily understand what the vocals are even if they sound really aggressive... take a listen to Naglfar for an example) so they oftentimes simply do not care for clear vocalization or are the vocalists actually able to. When you often listen to bands with such extreme vocals you will, however, start to make out words or sentences and after some time may even be able to guess large chunks of the lyrics just by listening......then again, I listen to extreme metal since being 16 or 17 yet am still not able to understand everything without taking a look at the lyrics... so don't be suprised you don't understand it, a lot of fans don't do simply by listening either.That being said, Napalm Death are awesome... if you like Death Metal and/or Grindcore/Deathgrind that is, if not, it will most likely be simply loud noise to you.

Secondly your choice to try them was absolutely not the greatest for starters.For understanding and enjoying heavy metal these albums are a must: Start with Black Sabbath's Paranoid and Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny. These are like the old and new testaments of the heavy metal. Explore some more with Dio's Holy Diver and Iron Maiden's The Number of The Beast. Add some Megadeth, I recommend Rust In Peace. Continue with Opeth. Preferably their album Damnation because it is quite mellow. Then move onto their album Morningrise. Try Agalloch's The Mantle as well.   Thank me later. ",

I myself am not familiar with this band, but I am an avid heavy metal band. I listen to a lot of prog, classic, thrash, hair, power, and glam metal. All hardcore metal albums lyrics have the same theme depending on the band. If I were you, I'd analyze the lyrics of this album and think what sort of overall theme the album has and work that theme into your perception of the songs. ",
