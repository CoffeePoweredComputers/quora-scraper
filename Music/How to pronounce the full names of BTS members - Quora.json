            "answer_text": "Suga (shoo-guh)/Min Yoongi (Min Yoon-gee) The g in gee is a guh sound not a juh sound so it is gee/gi not jee/ji Jeon (John- not as in the name John which sounds like Jahn but as in Juh-on) Jeongguk (The first part is similar to how to say his surname, Jeon, but it has an ng sound at the end, so it sounds like Juh-ong, and then guk sounds like gook with a hard g not a j. So Juh-ong gook) Kim (Kim sounds more like Gim then it does Kim, or I guess a blend of the two sounds. What I do is say a G sound while thinking of a k sound which kind of blends them when I say it. Although saying just Gim or Kim would not really be incorrectly so its fine saying either. Namjoon (Nahm-Joon) J-Hope (Sounds like its spelled) eJung (Like the first half of Jeongguk, Jung is actually Jeong, which sounds like Jong, when saying it however, make sure your mouth is a tight o instead of a big open o, this can drastically change the sound from johng to joe-ng, you want more of the joe-ng sound whenever making a sound with eo as in jeon or jeong) Hoseok (Ho/Hoe-soak) When I say his name I kind of make it a z sound like Ho-zoak, although you don\u2019t want to make the z sound obvious or iy will be incorrect since there is no Z in Korean. The z part really just is what it should feel like not sound like when you are saying it. So just say it like Hoe-soke/soak but fast. Kim (Kim/Gim) Seokjin (Seok is just like in Hoseok (although I don\u2019t make a z sound at all for this) but it is like Soke/Soak-Jin) Park (The Korean language actually does not use an r sound so when saying Park you would omit the r, making it Pak. It is not said as Pack, but more similarly to Pock) Jimin (Jim-as in the name Jim, and in- Jimin is pretty self explanatory although another way to pronounce it is Jee-min because the eh or ih sounds arent really used in Korean so its more of a harder sound) V (Bee, or bi- there is no letter with the v sound in Korean) Kim (Once again, is more Gim but Kim is fine too) Taehyung (Tay/Tae like day but with a t, hyung is more difficult, you kind of need to practice saying it a lot. It is like hee-young but take away the ee sound and say it fast so like h-young. Although young sounds a bit more like Yong so its really more like Tae-h-yeong/Tae-hyong. Although Tae-h-yung is fine too) I would say Taehyung, Hoseok, and Jungkook\u2019s names are the most difficult to pronounce. ",
