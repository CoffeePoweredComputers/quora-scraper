            "answer_text": "The comparison to your younger brother sounds like it could work. Describe it as favoritism, no parent wants to think they favor one child over another or gives that impression. Also, if you can claim that you\u2019ll walk part of the way home woth a friend, that may calm their fears. Your parents are engaging in what\u2019s called helicopter parenting. It\u2019s probably the biggest cause of anxiety in young adults, not having developed the confidence to do things for themselves. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, is your school area safe, close to home, and if far, has public transport? If none of those choices exist, that\u2019s probably why your mom doesn\u2019t let you walk to home alone. But, if all those reasons match, you must show her that you are responsible enough to walk home alone without being mugged or getting lost. I take two trains and walk for half an hour to get to school and the same on the way back. But if it\u2019s a reason other than responsibility and surroundings, you should ask her bluntly the exact reason and if you have a counter argument, say it if you still want to go. Just remember, she\u2019s most likely doing it for your safety and well being instead of trying to make your life miserable. ",

Girls and women are often in danger of being raped or even kidnapped. Change you thinking and be glad your parents care enough about you that they want you to stay safe. ",
