            "answer_text": " Absolutely. Most other skills depend on this skill. Let me elaborate. Which communication skill do you use most frequently? Which one are you most effective using? One of the most critical skills of successful people whether in the business world or private life is their ability to communicate effectively. The most important component of effective communication \u2026 effective listening skills. Listening is the communication skill most of us use the most frequently. Various studies stress the importance of listening as a communication skill. A typical study points out that many of us spend 70 to 80 percent of our waking hours in some form of communication. Of that time, we spend about 9 percent writing, 16 percent reading, 30 percent speaking, and 45 percent listening. Studies also confirm that most of us are poor and inefficient listeners. Why? Several reasons are likely: Listening training is few and far between Even though listening is the communication skill we use most frequently, it is also the skill in which we've had the least training. From personal experience, we know we've had much more formal training in other major communication skills \u2014 writing, reading, and speaking. In fact, very few persons have had any formal training in listening. The same is true of informal training. It's not difficult to find workshops and conferences that provide opportunities to improve our writing and speaking skills. But it is difficult to find similar training programs to sharpen listening skills.

Most of us speak at the rate of about 125 words per minute. However, we have the mental capacity to understand someone speaking at 400 words per minute (if that were possible). This difference between speaking speed and thought speed means that when we listen to the average speaker, we're using only 25 percent of our mental capacity. We still have 75 percent to do something else with. So, our minds will wander. This means we need to make a real effort to listen carefully and concentrate more of our mental capacity on the listening act. If we don't concentrate, we soon find that our minds have turned to other ideas. Inefficient listeners Numerous tests confirm that we are inefficient listeners. Studies have shown that immediately after listening to a 10-minute oral presentation, the average listener has heard, understood and retained 50 percent of what was said. Within 48 hours, that drops off another 50 percent to a final level of 25 percent efficiency. In other words, we often comprehend and retain only one fourth of what we hear. We all want to be more than 25 percent efficient. It's not difficult to see the many problems inefficient listeners can create for themselves and others. Listening skill suffers with age in learning cycle Other studies indicate that our listening skill suffers as we get older. Ralph G. Nichols, long-time professor of rhetoric at the University of Minnesota (now retired), says in his book Are You Listening? that if we define the good listener as one giving full attention to the speaker, first-grade children are the best listeners of all. Nichols describes an experiment conducted with the cooperation of Minneapolis teachers from first grade through high school. Each teacher involved was asked to interrupt classes and suddenly ask pupils \"what were you thinking about?\" or \"what was I talking about?\" Results were discouraging but informative. The answers of first and second graders showed that more than 90 percent were listening. Percentages dropped in higher grades. In junior high school classes, only 44 percent of the students were listening. In high school classes, the average dropped to 28 percent. Focused listening is difficult Another likely reason for inefficient listening is that it's difficult and hard work to listen intently. Have you been forced to listen intently for an extended period of time? Try to remember your feelings. You were probably physically and mentally tired after such a period of concentration.

            "answer_text": "In a world where self-interest precedes everything else, where intolerance has become an acceptable value, the art of listening is fast fading into oblivion. Speaking and Listening are two sides of the same coin. Both form an integral part in the process of communication. Communication involves speaking and listening simultaneously. However, there is a fine distinction between the two processes of speaking and listening. The process of speaking necessarily involves repetition and reinforcement of what you already know, it remains a process which barely adds to the existing knowledge of the speaker. On the other hand, the process of listening results in the acquisition of new knowledge. The more you listen, the more knowledge you gain. Steven R. Covey rightly points out that \u201cmost people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply.\u201d This is what ails modern communication between individuals, communities as well as countries. People tend to harbour the false belief that they know everything about everything, that whatever they speak is the ultimate truth, and that listening and acknowledging others\u2019 point of view will hurt their ego. By adopting such an attitude, such people shut the doors to potential knowledge that might flow from others and lose out on opportunities to grow. In the light of fierce competition that characterizes the world of today, dialogue has given way to intense arguments, conversation has given way to debates. People no longer indulge in the art of listening to gain something but are always on the lookout for points that can help them pin down their opponent and give them a sense of achievement and victory. However, by not opening up their ears and being receptive to various opinions, they come out as losers and remain oblivious to newer perspectives. The problem, today, is that people prefer to live in their own comfortable cocoons and avoid things that challenge them. Nobody seems to have the time to listen intently to someone. To add to this, the growing culture of intolerance and taking offence easily that we see around us ensures that we listen only to refute or reply rather than understand. ",
