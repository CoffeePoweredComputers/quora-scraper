            "answer_text": "Can users in Telegram get hacked by image steganography? No. Steganography is the art of hiding information. Once that information has been hidden it takes effort to extract it. If I were to embed malicious code steganographically in pictures then Telegram would have to be able to detect those codes in the first place, before even executing them. I am not aware that Telegram comes with a built-in image-steganography module. Even then, the hidden information is usually encrypted and telegram is probably not going to execute random code found in a picture for no good reason. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s theoretically possible. There have already been successful hack that were based on code that was hiding inside JPEG images. Essentially that meets the definition of steganography. Telegram has never really proven itself to be secure, they simply claim that they are secure. There are no known modules inside Telegram that directly addresses steganographic attacks, so we cannot assume that it can\u2019t be hacked, so we have to assume (to be safe) that Telegram can be hacked by image steganography.
