Even if human civilisation lasts for billions of years, even if our lifespan is extended by centuries, even if everyone in the future becomes a professional musician, even if we populate every planet in the universe with prolific composers, we will never get to the point that we have no music that sounds new to us. We might collapse the economy trying to sort out copyright infringement laws, but we will never be bored. Incidentally, I remember as a child thinking that almost all music had been written long ago, and writing a new song must surely be as rare as discovering a new species of bird or principal of physics. I'm so glad I was wrong. ",
