But unless you play, you wouldn\u2019t know or care. ",

            "answer_text": "Apparently \u201cgolden clarinet\u201d is urban slang for a soprano sax, so there is no difference. The term may have evolved because the majority of people expect a sax to be curved in a certain way. However the most common form of soprano sax is straight like a clarinet. There are also curved versions - I have several of both types. ",
