            "answer_text": "There are various routes you can take for beginners, I used to use the John Schaum books, but quickly got tired of them. At the time I was a very busy teacher, and since I used those books, I wound up teaching the same lessons over and over again.  After teaching from these books, and others, I learned the pedagogy and now compose my own lessons for my students on an individual basis. This helps me to address the skills they need to improve. That\u2019s not to say you can\u2019t do that with Schaum, but their lessons get a bit repetitive after a while. I\u2019ve found once a student demonstrates understanding and good performance of a certain subject, just move on. There are some books that use different ways of writing music, as Stephen Gambone mentions (I assume pushing his own piano course) but in my 10+ years of private teaching experience, I\u2019ve found bringing those who initially train on an alternate system to standard music notation just makes the student have to work harder. This is why most books that use it wind up ditching alternate notation at least half way through. There\u2019s also the obvious practicality that standard music notation is the most used \u2014 so a student learning on an alternate system can\u2019t just find a chart online to play a song they\u2019d like if they only know the alternate system. The biggest thing is, keep it interesting. I always explain to my students that the first couple lessons are learning basics, and it can get boring; but I remind them that they will have the ability to play something recognizable very soon. I try to gear lessons towards their own interests, for example one student learned almost every song from Schoolhouse Rock. Some teachers use practice reward systems, which I\u2019m not against, but I\u2019ve found the biggest reward system is working on something that interests the student. When a student is working on something they\u2019re interested in, they are more apt to practice and continue playing. I\u2019ve had many students come to me all bummed out they couldn\u2019t stay home and play video games, but since I take their interests into account, they leave happy and wanting to play more. Sometimes I even have to kick students out of my office, because they\u2019ll just sit there practicing what I just taught them. In my early years, I was a big practice hound. This was a cue from my own training \u2014 my old teachers would talk about how I should practice, blah blah blah. Truth is doing that only creates more pressure on the student and parents, leading to piano being a chore, which you don\u2019t want it to be. Taking student\u2019s interests into my lessons helped a lot, because they wanted to practice. ",

            "answer_text": "By actually teaching piano, not teaching music theory or teaching how to \u2018read\u2019 sheet music. You do that by starting in the way that all piano students should start. By teaching the child to play chords and chord progressions with both hands, preferably while singing or humming the tune. This is a left-hand only version of Silent Night but you should get the idea how it can be done with both hands.  ",
