Be it pop or punk, metal or melodies, classical or country, rap or rock.. People here listen to everything. Bollywood OSTs are particularly popular, Pakistani music has a special place in our hearts. Eminem is Rap God, Badshah, yo yo or Raftar are not that bad. State/culture wise there are thousands of genres and sub genres. For example what bihu beat is to an assamese, bhangra is to a punjabbi. And the list grows from state to state. The billboards top 100 in India or the UK will pretty much be same everytime. Personally I like Linkin Park the most(has been on my top 10 since I was a kid) ",

            "answer_text": "Given the sheer size of the Indian population, giving a generic answer to this question would not do it justice. That said, the Indian population follows the same trend that most demographics follow when it comes to music. A large (say 80%) of the population listens to pop music (which in the case of India is Bollywood or regional - Kollywood/Tollywood music). Small groups of people in different cities like Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi, Shillong, listen to genres such as rap, metal, rock, jazz and blues from around the world. This seems to be the case because artists in these genres typically add the above mentioned cities to their tour routes when visiting India. ",
