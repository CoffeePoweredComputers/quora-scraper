            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think vibrato sounds good. I accept it as a historical fact, beginning in the High Baroque, when castrati used it as a form of ornament, and gradually made it an integral part of vocal performance in opera of the 19th century. I was in the Tucson Boys\u2019 Choir as a kid, and later a paid chorister in NYC (some very old Episcopal churches had few parishioners and a substantial trust for hiring singers), particularly those with boy soprano choristers. I don\u2019t have a pleasant voice, but I could sight-read music, and there was no rehearsal before each Sunday service. I studied with the NY Pro Musica, and did a couple performances with the Motet Choir. I am a fan of children\u2019s voices (usually boys, but gradually becoming inclusive) in the soprano parts of choirs for music from 1600 to 1800. But the major reason for vibrato is its use by the orchestral string section. Imagine hearing Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony played without vibrato \u2014 the difficulty of getting in tune with 20\u201330 other violins would make it harsh, not very attractive. It\u2019s difficult to get two violins to play unison. But when every string player is playing with a light vibrato, there is a kind of cumulative unison that sounds good. \u201cThe use of vibrato is intended to add warmth to a note. In the case of many string instruments the sound emitted is strongly directional, particularly at high frequencies, and the slight variations in pitch typical of vibrato playing can cause large changes in the directional patterns of the radiated sound.\u201d This can add a shimmer to the sound; with a well-made instrument it may also help a solo player to be heard more clearly when playing with a large orchestra. This directional effect is intended to interact with the room acoustics to add interest to the sound.\u201d This is probably accurate, but is not the reason Mozart specified multiple strings in his later works, and directed that vibrato be used. But before we simply buy into vibrato as a universal surrender, please listen to some \u201cPeriod\u201d or \u201cHistorical\u201d performances. In particular, listen to what the absence of vibrato can produce. My examples are by Purcell, both in soli and ensemble:  and an example of how it could be used as an ornament:  The vibrato is used as a way to extend the lines in the countertenors. ",

            "answer_text": "This is only a semi-serious answer, but I think it's worth considering. As with Fabio's answer to \"why do people like spices,\" I believe one can approach this using evolutionary biology. People might like spices because they tend to have antimicrobial effects on food (garlic is currently being investigated for this). Similarly, there may be an evolutionary advantage to liking vibrato. There is a natural tendency for the human voice to vibrato during singing. I'm not entirely clear on the physics of this, but if you especially listen to the singing of the people in large plain areas (Mongolia) or mountains (Alps) where the carrying of the voice is important, the singers all carry a heavy amount of vibrato. So perhaps vibrato evolved as a necessity for loud singing voices, which translated into the lyricism with which we associate it today. You'll note that vibrato doesn't really exist much in the Baroque or Classical eras of instrumental music, but begins to play a heavy role in the Romantic era when instruments began to more closely imitate the human voice.
