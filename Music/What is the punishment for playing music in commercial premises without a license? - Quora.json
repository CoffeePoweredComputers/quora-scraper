            "answer_text": "Music can be played in the background of your house for personal entertainment. It can also be used in the commercial setup like Hotels, Restaurant, Bar, Pub, etc. It has a great connection between such commercial setup, customers/visitors and music. I own a small restaurant so I know importance of playing the music very well for ensuring the customer visits next time. I was totally unaware about such licenses for playing music until I read news that major big hotels in Calcutta got notices from Court for using the music that has copyright. I started searching more and more about it and realized that I was wrong as well by using music in my restaurant without procuring any such copyrights. As per Copyright Act, Infringement of copyright attracts heavy penalty which can extend upto a fine of Rs.2, 00,000/- (Rupees Two Lac only) and imprisonment of 3 (three) years. I started searching online immediately and came across Novex Communications and PPL as two major providers. I called them to know more about licenses and respective cost. After understanding everything on call in detail I sent them formal email regarding my requirement to ensure the costing is right and there are NO Hidden charges to be added at the later stage. I went with Novex Communications considering the song lists that can be played in my restaurant. I have thus safeguarded myself from the future legal harassment.
