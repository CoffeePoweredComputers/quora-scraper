Despite talk of Baron Cohen being banned from appearing as his character, he did indeed turn up. The video he created addressing the video is also very funny.   The film isn't released yet, but Sacha Baron Cohen's publicity stunts have certainly raised the profile of the film, not to mention raising a few smiles on the faces of those watching. Also check out the opportunistic guy pocketing the lid of the urn, has it turned up on ebay yet? ",
