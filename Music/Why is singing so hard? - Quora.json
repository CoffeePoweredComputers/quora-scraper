            "answer_text": "Singing boils down to three basic things: \u2022 The air you send the vocal cords \u2022 The muscles of the cords to resist the air \u2022 The resonance to enhance the resulting sound wave It would seem pretty easy, wouldn\u2019t it? Three simple things you need to work with: air, cords, resonance\u2026yet why is it often so hard to sing? It is because these three things have so many variables, and yet they all need to coordinate together in very precise ways. You need to send air, but the right amount of air at the correct airflow, to the vocal cords. The vocal cords need to coordinate intricate muscle adjustment not only for pitch, but also for the correct amount of resistance to the flow of air coming up from the lungs. Another issue for the vocal cords are the almost automatic involvement of muscles that are meant for swallowing, not singing. Keeping these muscles passive while singing takes practice. You then need to adjust your vocal amplifiers, or resonators, of your throat and mouth to the exact size and shape to not only gives you the vowel you need, but to also interact properly with the sound wave. Get this part wrong and you mess up everything you\u2019ve done before. Yep, you can adjust the air and vocal cords correctly, but an improper vowel shape can send the whole operation sideways. Will Singing Always Be This Hard? Well, yes and no\u2026but a bigger no. Here\u2019s what\u2019s great about singing \u2013 when you start getting everything aligned, the system seems to take over and drive itself. Have you ever hit a note that sounded amazing, yet felt effortless? That\u2019s the magic place, as I like to call it. The effortlessness can be so profound that it can confuse us. In fact, often the first reaction is it can\u2019t be right because it\u2019s TOO EASY!!! The ease is caused by natural forces in singing that help reinforce each other. Let\u2019s look at a perfectly sung note: You send the right amount of air from the lung to the vocal cords, not over-pushing with abdominal muscles, as so many singers end up doing. This air then helps bring the coordinated vocal cords together by the natural vacuum that is created by the air passing them. There is no need for over-use of vocal muscles, or the unneeded swallowing muscles. You are allowing natural forces to assist you. Then an even more amazing thing happens: The air molecules are compressed by the closed vocal cords and turned into sound waves \u2013 the compressed molecules spring forth when released and begin quickly vibrating. These vibrating molecules enter your throat and mouth, which are perfectly adjusted to boost these molecules. The air molecules begin to vibrate more intensely as they bounce around inside the correctly adjusted resonators. In fact, they get so much intensity that they start to create a traffic jam of energy \u2013 energy that needs to go somewhere. And where does this energy go? Well some of it goes out the mouth to the listener. But HERE\u2019S the REALLY COOL part! Some of the energy goes back down and presses on your vocal cords\u2026 Which makes it easier for them to resist the air\u2026 Which means you don\u2019t have to push as much air\u2026 And the energy helps regulate cord closure and airflow \u2013 so the whole system is working in harmony with itself\u2026 So you SOUND AMAZING!!!! This is the magic of good singing! It will give you great tone, easy high notes, extended rage, eliminate cracking, in fact getting your system to coordinate in this way will eliminate almost any issue you can think of. It\u2019s not a secret, it\u2019s not a special system\u2026it\u2019s SCIENCE! You can be a better singer; you just need to become a more informed one. ",

            "answer_text": "If you find singing difficult, I would guess it is because you are thinking too hard and actually getting in the way of the natural process. As other responders have said, singing is all about sending a consistent flow of air through your vocal folds\u2026 and it\u2019s air (or rather the lack of supported breathing) that can make it seem hard to sing. Consider when you\u2019re talking with your friends \u2014 you have likely never once had to stop and think \u201cOh, I should breath now or I will run out of air.\u201d And yet most of us are able to speak a complete thought without gasping or taking a breath in an odd place (like the middle of word!)\u2026yet when we sing, we sometimes enter this strange place where breathing is something we have to THINK about and suddenly we push too far or stop in a place that hurts the meaning of the song lyric. Find a community chorus or choir and hand out with other singers, notice how the best singers are usually the most relaxed - there is no tension in their neck, lips, or tongue. It appears effortless and, when you\u2019re in the zone, it feels effortless. Practice and some good instruction will be the best recipe for you to improve and find the joy in relaxed, air-driven singing. ",
