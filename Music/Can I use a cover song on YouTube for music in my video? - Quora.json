            "answer_text": "U.S. perspective: It is a little unclear if you are performing and recording this cover yourself, or if you are using an audio recording made by someone else. So let\u2019s look at both. For audio recordings made by someone else, all audio recordings are protected by copyright. None have passed into public domain due to a quirk in U.S. copyright law. So you have to get permission, which means getting a license to use that song. You would do this by contacting the record publisher (or the artist directly, if you know them). \u201cBackground music\u201d is not a use that fits under the rules of Fair Use. And uses that don\u2019t make any money don\u2019t have an exception under copyright law. Consider: internet piracy is \u201cnon-profit\u201d, in that no one is making money from it. Totally illegal, though, right? When you make a free replacement for listening to the song, regardless of what else is in the video, you are infringing on the copyright of the audio track. Now, let\u2019s say you are recording the music yourself. Perhaps this is you playing cover songs in order to teach guitar or something. Live performances of cover songs are done so under a license that the venue buys. All concert halls, clubs, theaters, and even outdoor performance venues, just buy a license that goes to one administrative body, who then pays the songwriters. Because of this compulsory license, it is easy and painless to perform for a live crowd, but still make sure the songwriter (who owns the copyright on the sheet music) gets their fair share. But once you record it, there are problems. In order to record a songwriter\u2019s work you need a mechanical license. How do you get a mechanical/synchronized license for music from the recording company or a middleman? To then use that recording in any other media, such as a video, you also need a synchronization license. These is a non-trivial effort. And again, it doesn\u2019t matter if you are distributing your video for free or not (although that might affect the price charged for the license). You need to get this license to use that music you recorded in video or film. About the only exception is recording a live performance on stage. You still need a mechanical license, but this is not consider a use that is \u201csynchronization\u201d. Music lessons, a music video, or something else that is not documentation of a live performance all require this license, though. ",

And that is even if the cover is different enough from the original to be considered transformative. It is up to a judge to decide, on a case by case basis, if your work is transformative enough to fall under Fair Use. YouTube will not evaluate a video on if it is fair use or not because it opens them up to being sued by the original creator. ",

Then it's OK to use it.  Then you have to pay them the cost of the sync license, and have a certified CPA approve of your monthly payment. Sync licenses are sold on a per view rate, and different licenses cost different amounts. ",
