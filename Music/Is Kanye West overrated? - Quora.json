            "answer_text": "Kanye\u2019s composition skills and production abilities are second to none. He is also one of the most ambitious artists in the current mainstream lineup. If you read his autobiography you will learn that Kanye\u2019s ego and ambition were around long before he ever achieved critical acclaim and fame. I would go as far as to say that Mr. West is one of the top 3 composers of our era. Many would disagree with me on this but the way I have watched Kanye\u2019s career unfold there is no doubt in my mind. At the start of his career Kanye had to duke it out with 50 Cent to see who would reign hip-hop/rap king on the charts. When Kanye overtook the No. 1 position from 50 it was a paradigm shift in mainstream rap. No longer did you have to rap about gang-banging or selling drugs to become an influential rapper. Kanye opened the door for so many of your favorite rappers today like Drake, Future, J.Cole etc etc. Without Kanye we very well would have none of these men in the game. The next phase was 808\u2019s and Heartbreaks. That album was so revolutionary for rap I could write a book on it. The lyrical content, sublime production, use of auto-tune were all revolutionary in the world of rap at the time. When that album came out so many people hated it, but like most things Kanye does he is ahead of his time. He is able to see further and therefore that album went on to become one of his most loved and revered. The same thing happened with MDBTF and Yeezus. The production on Yeezus is so genius again an entire book could be written on it. Not to mention all the production work Kanye has done for other artists most notable Jay Z. Kanye is not overrated, the media loves to make him look crazy because maybe he is crazy but so was Van Gogh, Beethoven, Brahms and many many many other genius artists. And I haven\u2019t even started talking about fashion etc. You be the judge, is Kanye overrated or just an unrecognized genius. **Edit I wrote this blurb in about 5 minutes and does not truly convey the magnitude of Kanye West\u2019s artistic contribution to music and fashion. The man is a genius far beyond our comprehension and he knows it. He acts wild in the media and in public to make a point. His true genius lies in the fact he is aware of his greatness and of those who inspire him. He may call himself a God but I bet if you asked him he would say there is a God in everyone. Apparently those close to him say he is a very humble and loving man, before we are quick to judge the man we see in the media we should give him the benefit of the doubt. Kanye has gone through a lot to get where he is; he lost his mother to the fakeness of LA and has to live with that everyday. Kanye is just another human like you and me. However, he is aware of the power that lies within each and every human once they are able to overcome the illusion of reality. Cheers to Kanye for being a pioneer in the study of life. ",

            "answer_text": "The question would imply a broad consensus of opinion about Kanye West\u2019s work. Which, respectfully, I think there most certainly isn\u2019t. Kanye West is actually one of the more divisive figures in music, as likely to be severely underrated as overrated. The reality is, it\u2019s very hard to objectively rate any art or artist. One man\u2019s trash is another man\u2019s treasure, and Kanye West is no exception. Like most musicians, he\u2019s recorded some great stuff (most of College Dropout is masterful indeed, particularly in the context of being his debut record), he\u2019s recorded some OK stuff (a lot of album filler), and he\u2019s recorded some stuff that you wouldn\u2019t save from a fire (see list below). When he\u2019s good, in my opinion, he\u2019s very very good. Whether he\u2019s to your taste or not, it\u2019s inarguable that he\u2019s been a massive influence not just on hip hop, but on music more widely. If someone says to you Kanye is the greatest musician that\u2019s ever lived, it\u2019s possible that they\u2019re overrating him. Likewise, if someone tells you he\u2019s not even worth listening too, they\u2019re probably off the mark too. As a side note, here\u2019s some nominations from my own listening for: Tracks where Kanye West really excels himself: HeartlessMonsterBlack SkinheadHold My LiquorPOWERBlood On The LeavesUltralight BeamCan\u2019t Tell Me NothingAmazingHell Of A LifeJesus Walksand Tracks where Kanye West really lets himself down: I Thought About Killing YouHey MamaNever Let Me DownHighlightsNo MistakesHave a listen and judge for yourself. Thanks. ",
