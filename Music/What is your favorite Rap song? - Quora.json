            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A, this is a tough question to answer. I'm going to answer it, but i need you to take this serious and check them out. I'm gonna kick it off with the illest verse that ever graced the ears of Hiphop: \u201c\u201998 Freestyle\u201d - Big L : this song appears on the album \u201cThe Big Picture\u201d; which I'm sure everyone knows, but, if they don't, they need to know right now. I mean, right now!! Leave this page, do not continue on, GO!! It also can be found under the titles \u201c\u201998 Freestyle, parts I & II\u201d that contains a verse, and you can even find some versions with the full interview and everything from the Stretch Bobbito show. Whatever the case, get this, listen to it.\u201cChest 2 Chest Freestyle\u201d - The Lox : this originally appeared on DJ Clue\u2019s \u201cShow Me the Money\u201d mixtape from 1997. The song title appeared as simply \u201cFreestlyle\u201d, as most songs on DJ Clue tapes (a fact that would lead to much frustration as I moved to digital media), but I wrote \u201cChest 2 Chest\u201d because that's how it most commonly appears, because in the beginning they say \u201cL-O-X chest to chest, back to back, glock to glock, Mack to mack\u2026\u201d it is likewise simply titled \u201cL.O.X. Freestyle\u201d or even \u201cClue Freestyle\u201d. Whatever the case it's basically a Freestyle on that \u201cNext Level (Nyte Time Mix)\u201d which is on Showbiz & AG\u2019s album \u201cGoodfellas\u201d, which is a DJ Premier beat also. Anyway, Jada\u2019s verse is so trill.\u201cEnvy\u201d - Fat Joe : Samples Marvin Gaye\u2019s hit \u201cSexual Healing\u201d, and this song is my life, save a few minor details such as location, names, and titles. Other than that, it is me I plan to sue.\u201cCan It Be All So Simple (remix)\u201d - Raekwon : feat. Ghostface Killah, who just wrecked it. Went bonkers. The thing I always wondered too, is, how true the lyrics are because he really did get shot in the neck.\u201cEveryday Struggle\u201d - The Notorious B.I.G.\u201cCity Under Siege\u201d - The Get Boys : third verse especially.\u201cGettin\u2019 It\u201d - Too Short : if you can't appreciate this song, this flow, you ain't Hiphop. Give it up. This is the best, trillest even positive record.\u201cOh My Darling\u201d - Run the JewelsCocaine in the Back of the Ride\u201d - UGK\u201cStill a Nigga\u201d - Eazy-E\u201cStr8 Ballin\u201d 2Pac\u201cNuthin But a \u2018G\u2019 Thang\u201d - Dr. Dre : no one said this yet? What are you guys smoking? Not Chronic.\u201cRegular Cat\u201d - Memphis Bleek\u201cAll Money In\u201d - Nipsey Hussle\u201cLoves Gonna Get\u2019cha\u201d - Boogie Down Productions\u201cBuild & Destroy\u201d - Boogie Down Productions\u201cRapper\u2019s Delight\u201d - Sugarhill Gang : if you like Hiphop, you like this song. I'm sorry. A lot of hiphoppas I know will not admit it, because they're \u201ctoo cool\u201d or whatever, but they're lying. They love this song.\u201cMemory Lane\u201d - Nas\u201cOne Time 4 Your Mind\u201d - Nas\u201cGive Up the Goods (Just Step)\u201d - Mobb Deep\u201cCan't Truss It\u201d - Public Enemy\u201cIf I Get Locked Up Tonight\u201d - Eminem : This is actually a Funkmaster Flex & Big Kap track came out on \u201cThe Tunnel\u201d, but it features Eminem and Dr. Dre.\u201cFubba U Cubba Freestyle\u201d - Eminem : this is a piece of a Freestyle, usually titled as it appears in my entry, and the first time I heard it was on DJ Greenlantern\u2019s \u201cAnger Management Tour Mixtape\u201d, but I've seen it titled differently elsewhere. It was actually a Freestyle from a Tim Westwood show over the \u201cGot It Twisted\u201d by Mobb Deep beat, but there is actually a whole song where all D12 rips, and its dope, I recommend that version. Kuniva is one of the most underrated, Proof (RIP) was too. I think they're underrated because they rap with Em.\u201cDesperadoes\u201d - The Firm\u201cHeat Wave\u201d - Chris Rivers\u201cDreams & Nightmares (Intro)\u201d - Meek Mill\u201cFuck Martinez\u201d - 2 Live Crew :This is my last and final entry, it may be better to do albums next time, but these are some of the illest verses in Hiphop history, I know there are many more of equal caliber. The last entry, of course, was on Uncle Luke\u2019s first solo album, but the also released it under 2 Live Crew with another album cover change; however, both are the same album, both titled \u201cBanned in the U.S.A.\u201d However, I put this on the list, even though it lacks the lyrical presence as the other songs because the history makes the song so ill, and so classic. This was the album they released in the famous Supreme Court case, requiring rappers to put the \u201cParental Advisory\u201d stickers on the album covers. The story goes: Bob Martinez, Florida governor had Navarro (the album also features a song called \u201cFuck Navarro\u201d) arrest 2 Live Crew related to the contents of their music, and tried to ban all of their music and shows from Florida. So, they dropped \u201cBanned in the U.S.A.\u201d which, of course features the above mentioned song, where it's a bass dance-club type record with Luke yelling, \u201cFuck Martinez, Fuck, Fuck, Marteen-ez\u201d the whole song. It's epic. It just embodies the Hiphop message and Hiphop philosophy. I love listening to it, gives me a sense of sheer pleasure. ",

            "answer_text": "JAY-Z - 99 Problems (sorry about the censoring)Enough said really. Iconic hook, great storytelling, rhymes and flow. When I was young it was all my dad used to play in the car, so naturally I grew attached. 2. Jay Z ft. Rihanna & Kanye West - Run This Town (sorry about the live version) This was on repeat all the time when I was young on my MP3 player. My childhood anthem, not to mention the amazing features and the chemistry they have. 3. Kanye West - Homecoming (sorry about the censoring) The best song on Graduation, and in my opinion Kanye\u2019s greatest song. A song that combines cool song elements and a great instrumental. I challenge you to not sing a long to Chris Martin\u2019s chorus. 4. Asher Roth - I Love College (sorry for the censoring) I know, I know, I can hear all you hip hop heads sharpening your pitchforks. Me and my best friend really love this song. We learnt all the lyrics in a night, and while not a lyrically groundbreaking song, it\u2019s a really fun and chill song. It\u2019s also what got me into Asher Roth. 5. Kanye West - So Appalled (feat. Jay-Z, CyHi Da Prynce & Pusha T) (sorry about the audio) In my opinion, the best multi feature/cypher rap song post 2000. The word play and lyricism is phenomenal. There isn\u2019t a weak verse, and the beat and flows just work so well. My favourite song on MBDTF. 6. Jay-Z - A Dream (feat. Faith Evans & The Notorious B.I.G.) (there\u2019s no youtube video or audio where I searched) A nice tribute song and a cool use of a sample. Also, I really like how Jay made it sound so good despite rhyming \u2018I said\u2019 with \u2018I said\u2019 about 20 times over. Also, when I was young, my dad played the shit out of this song. He was a big Jay-Z fan. 7. Coolio - Gangsta's Paradise feat. L.V. Not much to say. Probably the most recognizable song in rap and hip hop. Everything about it is just good, and very real. Coolio\u2019s underrated. 8. Outkast - Ms Jackson Another ballad from my childhood. It\u2019s just so catchy. It\u2019s a great song that is just the ultimate nostalgia trip. 9. Biz Markie - Just A Friend I challenge you to not sing, hum or belt out the chorus in your head. The ultimate karaoke song, party song and all round just fun song. 10. Kid Cudi - Day 'N' Nite A cool, groovy song that has a really cool vibe to it. Great song to get high to. Alternative 10. Kanye West - Stronger Day N Nite is more singing than rapping, so I included an alternative if you thought that too. Stronger is in my top 3 Kanye songs. It\u2019s motivational and hype, yet very cool and chill if you want it to be. Great lyrics too. ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly, life is good by Drake has nice beats but my favourite lyrics in a rap song are in Reagan by Killer Mike Reagan - Killer Mike : The song begins with the registration of 40th US president Ronald Reagan, that during the second half of the 1980s was involved in the so-called Irangate, the Iran-Contra affair. The Reagan administration sold arms to Iran, who was fighting against Iraq, in exchange for its influence in releasing American hostages held in Lebanon, and the profits of the trade financed the militant group Contras in Nicaragua. Killer Mike uses the character, Reagan, to shout out against both the government and the rap industry corruption, \u201cRonald Reagan was an actor. He was a pitchman at first, and so people naturally trust him. He understood how to weave magic when he was speaking, and that\u2019s what we as entertainers do. So when Jay-Z tells you to buy some Reeboks, it means more. Ronald Reagan at one point was the biggest pitchman in the world. I think that Reagan was used by a political party, by people who had vested means, to push their own agendas. He had his own agendas, and I think that no rapper had ever said, \u2018I\u2019ve been guilty of this. I have hurt my community as a rapper.'\u201d He uses the personality as a way to open people\u2019s eyes in front of a reality that is not always easy to accept, as it\u2019s underlined in the lyrics of the song \u201cJust another talking head telling lies on teleprompters\u201d. One of the issues contained in the song concerns the war on drugs in the US that has produced profoundly unequal outcomes across racial groups (\u201cThey declared the war on drugs like a war on terror/But it really did was let the police terrorize whoever\u201d), targeting African Americans and Latinos, because of their association with urban and lower-income communities, and therefore most likely to become drug addicts. Killer Mike complains about the abuse of the criminal justice system towards marginalised communities on the basis of racial discrimination (\u201cBut mostly black boys, but they would call us \u201cniggers\u201d/And lay us on our belly, while they fingers on they triggers\u201d). Overall \u201cReagan\u201d depicts a cruel but sadly honest picture of the reality of today, and the author\u2019s intent is to point out a social issue rather than a political one, as he pointed out in an interview to National Public Radio (NPR).

The first time I heard this (I\u2019d just bought the tape and was listening to it on headphones) I literally had an eargasm at hearing Mecca\u2019s mix of ASMR intimacy and black radical self-confidence; all set against that weird desolate cosmic backdrop that makes you feel you\u2019re watching nebulae dancing at the heart of the universe. And then when the drums hit 12 seconds later I was (metaphorically) spurting all over the place. (Apologies for the imagery, but I have a point to make here, people.) Then it gets boring again \u2026 why do they love that jazzy guitar riff so much? It gets pretty good again when doodlebug and butterfly do their thing over the verse music. Then the playout it execrable. Unless you like some dude actually doing live jazzy widdling for about 3 unnecessary minutes. (Sorry jazzy guitar dude, I had a friend who loved that part, it just wasn\u2019t for me.) But, really, it\u2019s Mecca\u2019s first verse which is one of the most sublime, perfect 40 seconds of music ever created by human (or insect) kind. ",

            "answer_text": "It is a very hard question to answer as I am drawing a thin line between living in Old School rap and New School rap. Old SchoolOne of my personal favorites is C.R.E.A.M by Wu-Tang because of its influential lyrics. I also appreciate Yoke the joker by Naughty by Nature. The albums \u201cMe Against The World\u201d from Tupac and \u201cSlim Shady EP\u201d by Eminem are also something I crave for all the time.New SchoolWell, many.. There are many new school rappers who\u2019re rocking it right now. From Kendrick\u2019s Damn to Logic\u2019s Everybody. Chance the rapper\u2019s Acid Rap to J. Cole\u2019s 4 Your Eyez Only. These are all some legit rap albums from new school in recent times. Most of the songs are deeply felt and exist in the deepest veins of my heart. Actually, it is pretty difficult for me to answer your question because my preference to a rap song changes rapidly as new songs keep coming up or I reminisce the old songs they become the favorite. again.As for this instance, I love hearing Molly by Lil dicky ft. Brendon Urie on repeat, but it may change after some time.",

This goes out to someone that wasOnce the most important person in my lifeI didn\u2019t realize it at the timeI can\u2019t forgive myself for the way I treated you soI don\u2019t really expect you to eitherIt\u2019s just... I don\u2019t even knowJust listen\u2026 Some lines sounds like poetry which fulfills the purpose of RAP, as it is an acronym for Rhythm And Poetry! When I first saw you, I knew it was realI\u2019m sorry about the pain I made you feel That wasn\u2019t me; let me show you the wayI looked for the sun, but it\u2019s raining todayI remember when I first looked into your eyesIt was like God was there, heaven in the skies He is justifying Georgia Cates's quote, \"Music is what feelings sound like\", perfectly. Tell me if i'm wrong! I knew you gonna sit and play this with your new manAnd then sit and laugh as you\u2019re holding his handThe thought of that just shatters my heartIt breaks in my soul and it tears me apart This song is the strongest, I've been hearing for quite a while (roughly 8 + years) ...just AWESOME!!!! I guess everything you said was a lieI think about it, it brings tears to my eyesNow I\u2019m not even a thought in your mindI can see clearly, my love is not blind This song will make you wanna chop the other person's head off (who is being blamed here).  It has the best lyrics in the world. You said you were my best friend, was that a lie?Now I\u2019m nothing to you, you\u2019re with another guyI tried, I tried, I tried, and I\u2019m tryingNow on the inside it feels like I\u2019m dying And these little talking verses in between and in the end will give you goosebumps for life. It's one of a kind.  And I do miss youI just thought we were meant to beI guess now, we\u2019ll never knowThe only thing I want is for you to be happyWhether it be with me, or without meI just want you to be happy I almost forgot; It also has the most awesome melodious background music ever made in the history of rap music. Period. P.S: I really really want Eminem to do a cover of this song.  Source- AVIATION LYRICS - You Were My Everything  ",

            "answer_text": "I tend to favor the older rap songs. These days, there is just too much foul language in rap music. They genre tries to stay true to it\u2019s community, where that language is normally spoken, so I understand why. I just don\u2019t enjoy listening to it. And, on radio and tv, the foul language is blocked out, so the songs don\u2019t sound complete when they do that. As per usual, I\u2019m not picking one song, but I can say there is a song that probably is the best one. Jay-Z featuring Alicia Keys homage to New York in \u201cEmpire State of Mind\u201d is the best rap song. This was one of the best live performances of the song, at the 2009 Grammy Awards:  Jay-Z\u2019s collaboration with Justin Timberlake in 2013\u2019s \u201cSuit and Tie\u201d was a huge hit for JT, and provided with another great rap performance from Jay-Z:  So, I suppose Jay-Z is my favorite rap artist. A nod to the earlier artists who released cleaner recordings, understanding that they wouldn\u2019t get much radio play if they didn\u2019t. But it was rap music that I appreciated more. Heavy D, Will Smith, and the groundbreaking Sugarhill Gang, who had the first real big rap hits with \u201cRapper\u2019s Delight\u201d and this little ditty\u2026  ",
