            "answer_text": "Music affects the brain in many positive ways. It makes you smarter, happier and more productive at any age. Listening is good, playing is even better. Music has played an important part of every human culture, both past and present.People around the world experience universal responses to music.We\u2019re all familiar with how certain pieces of music can change your mood, get you motivated, or help you concentrate.And now, advances in neuroscience enable researchers to quantitatively measure how music affects the brain.Their discoveries are exciting, and good news for music lovers.Music is a fantastic brain exercise that activates every known part of the brain.Music can make you smarter, happier and more productive at all stages of life.Let\u2019s take a closer look at some of the latest findings on the many ways both playing and listening to music can enhance your brain. 1.Musicianster Brains If you want evidence of how music affects the brain, it makes sense to look at the brains of people who play a lot of music \u2014 professional musicians. Brain scans show that their brains are different from the rest of ours. Their brains are noticeably more symmetrical. Areas of the brain responsible for motor control, auditory processing, and spatial coordination are larger. They also have a larger corpus callosum. This is the band of nerve fibers that enables the two hemispheres of the brain to communicate with each other. 2.Music Can Improve Your Mood Most of us aren\u2019t professional musicians, but listening to music can still enhance your work performance. Listening to music at work can make you a happier, more productive employee, especially if it\u2019s music you\u2019ve chosen. Office workers allowed to listen to their preferred choice of music complete tasks more quickly and come up with better ideas than those who have no control over their musical choices. Science has now proven what music lovers already know, that listening to upbeat music can improve your mood. Listening and playing music reduces chronic stress by lowering the stress hormone cortisol. Music can make you feel more hopeful, powerful, and in control of your life. 3.Music Boosts Brain Chemicals One of the ways music enhances brain function is by stimulating the formation of certain brain chemicals. Listening to music, increases the neurotransmitter dopamine. This is the brain\u2019s \u201cmotivation molecule\u201d and an integral part of the pleasure-reward system. It\u2019s the same brain chemical responsible for the feel-good states obtained from eating chocolate, orgasm, and runner\u2019s high. Playing music with others or enjoying live music stimulates the brain hormone oxytocin. OXYTOCIN has been called the \u201ctrust molecule\u201d and the \u201cmoral molecule\u201d since it helps us bond with and trust others. There\u2019s evidence that the oxytocin bump experienced by music lovers can make them more generous and trustworthy. 4.Music Helps You Learn Many schools have cut music programs due loss of funding, and this is widely believed by parents and educators to be a big mistake. Music, whether taught in or outside of school, helps students excel in the following ways: improved language developmentsmall increase in IQimproved test scoresincreased brain connectivityincreased spatial intelligenceCounterintuitively, music can help students excel in science. The last item on this list spatial intelligence, helps students understand how things work together. This skill is critical in careers like architecture, engineering, math, and computer science. 5.The Effects of Musical Training on Young Brains In the 1990s, the effects of music on the brain were popularized by the MOZART EFFECT. This theory purported that listening to music composed by Mozart can make you smarter. Parents had their babies listening to the music of Mozart to give their brains a jumpstart, often even before they were born. The accepted theory now is that taking music lessons as a child enhances brain function and structure, but that there\u2019s nothing uniquely beneficial about the music of Mozart. Children with musical training do better in subjects like language, reading, and math and have better fine motor skills than their non-musical classmates. Early music lessons encourages brain plasticity \u2014 the brain\u2019s capacity to change and grow. And if kids don\u2019t stick with their music lessons forever, that\u2019s OK. There\u2019s evidence that a little bit of music training goes a long way. Just a half-hour music lesson increases blood flow in the left hemisphere of the brain. As little as four years of music lessons were found to improve certain brain functions, even when tested 40 years later! When exposure to music training begins before age seven, the brain enhancement that takes place can last a lifetime. Kids who sing together in a choir report higher satisfaction in all their classes, not just music. Most studies on music and the brain have been done on older kids. But it looks like it\u2019s never too young to start. Music lessons of sorts \u2014 playing drums and singing nursery rhymes \u2014 were given to babies before they could walk or talk. Babies who had music lessons communicated better, smiled more, and showed earlier and more sophisticated brain responses to music. Just as it\u2019s never too early to start, it\u2019s also never too late to benefit from music either. Seniors who play an instrument, sing or dance reap physical, psychological and social benefits from music. Music protects against memory problems and cognitive decline more so than other leisure activities. 6.How Music Therapy Improves Quality of Life Anyone can play or listen to music for \u201crecreational purposes only\u201d and still gain brain benefits. But when professional health care help is warranted, you can enlist the aid of a music therapist. Music Therapists are trained to use music therapeutically to address their patients\u2019 physical, emotional, cognitive, and social needs. There are measurable changes in certain neurotransmitters following music therapy. Music therapy has proven useful for treating people with autism, dementia, Alzheimer\u2019s, chronic pain, emotional trauma, and a variety of mental disorders including depression. Potential benefits from working with a music therapist include improved mood, concentration, and motivation, and decreased anxiety, anger, stress, and frustration. 7.The Amazing Way Music Therapy Helps Alzheimer\u2019s Patients One of the most remarkable successes of music therapy is the impact it has on the lives of Alzheimer\u2019s patients. Advanced Alzheimer\u2019s patients lose their ability to have interactive conversations with others and eventually stop speaking completely. But music therapy has been very successful at getting through to patients even when nothing else has. When hearing familiar music, patients often visibly \u201clight up\u201d and sing along. It seems that musical memories far outlast other kinds of memories. Caretakers and family members report that for most patients, music therapy is the best part of the day. Music therapy does more than help patients remember. It helps alleviate depression, anxiety, and agitation while improving brain function and overall quality of life. 8.How Music Affects the Brain: The Bottom Line There\u2019s strong evidence that playing a musical instrument or listening to music can positively impact brain health and function. This brain boosting effect is evident at all stages of life. Everyone benefits, from babies to seniors. Music can improve mood, increase intelligence, enhance learning and concentration, and ward off the effects of brain aging. Music therapy can help various mood and brain disorders, including Alzheimer\u2019s. P.S. - No matter your age, it\u2019s never too soon or too late to fill your life with music! So sit back and enjoy the ride in peace. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Music is known to directly impact our brains in many ways. What kind of music do you typically listen to in the morning? Because I bet your song choices, whether you are listening or singing, benefit you in some way. Whether that means pumping you up, calming you down, making you think, or the myriad other things that a pleasing melody or thumping beat can do. The power of music seems magical at times. I often put on music at many moments in my day out of ritual but also because having a soundtrack to my life brings me comfort somehow. In my early 20s I would often wake up and instantly put on a Sigur Ros CD while making coffee; the ethereal strokes of bows on guitar strings in my apartment was a perfectly dreamy way to start the day. Clearly the music I\u2019m picking \u2014 and when I\u2019m choosing to listen to it \u2014 has an impact. It\u2019s the same with you. Stanford researchers have looked into how our brains react to music, as explained here: Feeling the beat: Symposium explores the therapeutic effects of rhythmic music Music with a strong beat stimulates the brain and ultimately causes brainwaves to resonate in time with the rhythm, research has shown. Slow beats encourage the slow brainwaves that are associated with hypnotic or meditative states. Faster beats may encourage more alert and concentrated thinking. It\u2019s not just the noise that triggers activity in our brains, but the space between tones: beautiful silence. Here\u2019s how science describes the phenomenon. The research team showed that music engages the areas of the brain involved with paying attention, making predictions and updating the event in memory. Peak brain activity occurred during a short period of silence between musical movements - when seemingly nothing was happening. Beyond understanding the process of listening to music, their work has far-reaching implications for how human brains sort out events in general.  ",
