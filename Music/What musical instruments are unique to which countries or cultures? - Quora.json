            "answer_text": "This is a great question. Thanks for asking. Most instruments were created at a certain time, then evolve into something else. The harp evolved into the lap harp, the traveling harp and even influenced the guitar. Harpsichord became the piano. The thing to remember is that all instruments evolve. They use some instruments for some types of music but never get locked into one instrument for a particular music style. Here is a good example, Weird Al brought an Accordion into Rap, Rock, Country, and more. Some people would say that we should only use it for Umpa bands. So broaden your thinking when you are thinking about instruments. Here is one for you. France and Italy used the guitar for classical music. Later down the road a Young America would take that guitar and create blues, folk, rock, country, and bluegrass. In Italy we use a mandolin for cultural specific folk music. But here in the US the mandolin was a bluegrass instrument almost exclusively. The factors that determined what instrument is played where and when; are cost, availability, and transportation.
