            "answer_text": "I just have one: J-Hope is not the mystery that everyone claims him to be. I\u2019m not saying that I know him personally, but from reading his song lyrics, watching his interviews, etc., I think I understand J-Hope more than most ARMYs. When I first got into BTS, I didn\u2019t think too much of him. I thought he was always pretty calm until I saw him on Good Morning America lol. Personally, I do prefer calm and serious Hobi to Sunshine Hobi, although I don\u2019t mind the latter. Moving onto the main point of this answer. . . A common \u201ccomplaint\u201d that people make about J-Hope is that he\u2019s not open enough about his past, his struggles, and his feelings with ARMYs - I would beg to differ. His past: Again, I don\u2019t know J-Hope personally, but from the looks of it, he seemed to have grown up in a relatively happy and supportive household. J-Hope and his sister openly share photos of them together and with their families all the time. They look happy. Trainee struggles aside, maybe J-Hope just didn\u2019t have those kinds of obstacles (e.g. unsupportive parents, poverty) like the other BTS members. Consequently, he doesn\u2019t talk about them. His struggles: J-Hope seems like one of those people who sucks it up and pushes through all the pain and obstacles until he reaches the other side. He doesn\u2019t like to bring them up because he doesn\u2019t want to burden others with his worries. It might not be healthy, but it\u2019s how he deals with challenges, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Hobi might not directly tell ARMYs he\u2019s worried or about his vulnerabilities via VLives, interviews, etc., however, I do think he is telling us indirectly through his song lyrics. For example, in Jamais Vu, J-Hope\u2019s rap: It'd be better if it was a gameBecause it hurts so muchI need to heal my medicBut I'm another starBlame myself since I was imperfectBrake in my head, brake in my step, alwaysAll I wanted was to do wellI wanted to make you smile... damn ^^ I\u2019m going to assume that J-Hope wrote this because he did rap this part and he was listed as the second writer after Hitman Bang. The lines in bold - I think it\u2019s a clue right there of J-Hope trying to tell us something. Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I was told that this was a song for ARMYs? Even if it was for us, those words just don\u2019t come out of thin air. Again, I am not J-Hope nor do I know him personally, but he must have been feeling something not good to write those lyrics down. Although he smiles all the time and is a ball of sunshine, perhaps deep down he was never completely satisfied with himself :,( I won\u2019t go into detail about it here because that would just be a novel of an answer, but I think Hobi\u2019s struggles, feelings, and personality were made clear in his mixtape, Hope World. It featured multiple aspects of him that I don\u2019t think most people have seen before. His feelings: As mentioned above, Hobi is not one to come out often about his feelings. However, when he does, oh boy, you better prepare your boxes of tissues. He is an emotional mess when he cries and you can just see how much stress he\u2019s been holding in since day one. He hides his feelings underneath his bright smile, but when he shows them, he REALLY unleashes them. Just look at him during the 2019 MAMA Daesang win. I dunno. . . maybe it\u2019s just because I\u2019m the same way, so I kind of understand? Anyhow, those were my two cents. Was this even unpopular? I\u2019m not sure. Maybe I\u2019m just simple-minded and take things at face-value, so I don\u2019t look to deep into each BTS member\u2019s character. I just don\u2019t think J-Hope is a mystery. . . His character seems pretty evident through his lyrics to me :/ I know ARMYs want to get to know the \u201creal\u201d J-Hope beyond Sunshine Man, but I think how he is now, is the \u201creal\u201d Hobi: Happy when needed, serious when not needed. If it\u2019s not, then it\u2019s fine - stop asking him to tell us more about himself. If he doesn\u2019t want to, respect his privacy and let him be. He does enough for us already. If you have a different take on this, feel free to respectfully express them down in the comments below. I\u2019m interested in hearing what you have to say. Apologies if none of this made sense, but it\u2019s 1:30AM where I am. I don\u2019t sleep much so my brain is kind of mush right now. I\u2019m also terrible at expressing my \u201cdeep\u201d thoughts and feelings, so again, sorry if I didn\u2019t express myself well enough. I\u2019m working on it. I\u2019ll be back to edit this answer and clarify things when I have more time. Good night. ",

            "answer_text": "Story time on when I started to take the first step of becoming an army and loving Hobi coming your way. With some images cause I don\u2019t want you guys to just read with no images. I\u2019m not boring gosh. When I first saw bts which was just an image I loved Jungkook. Though I didn\u2019t really know his name so who ever would talk about bts I would just say, \u201cI love him!\u201d And I would point at the picture of him without 1 knowing his name and 2 not knowing anything.  ^The first picture I saw and liked Jungkook My friends told me that his name was jungkook and I couldn\u2019t pronounce it right so it was a bit sad for me. I didn\u2019t hear any of there music back then but as I started to get recommendations on some videos/ memes about bts I would click on it and watch. After watching some memes about them I have come to love them but I wanted to know more about them. So I sat on my laptop all night listening to them and watching their MV. I honestly thought they all looked the same btu there was one that stood out. His smile, laugh, and his dance moves are pretty nice. I did a bit of research and it was J hope.  I started to watch them much more often and without knowing I was an Army and my bias was actually J hope. Like seriously all I would talk about is him from bts. I keep watching moments of him and he was the most cutest thing ever. I love the energy he has and the was he smiles. His face is naturally an aegyo and he is just IDEK! I love how he has the loudest voice among the rest of the members. How he would alway say yep in a lot of interviews. I can\u2019t skip a picture of him without adoring his face and his style. I really love him and the way he introduces himself. I love his rapping and dance move. And to be honest I do have many stuff in common with him. I love annoying my friends and by what I see he loves doing it too. I really really love him and I want to thank him for being a very cut and adorable angel.  I wrote I could say a lot, you read I could say a lot, and time for BTS MEMES! My favorite part about answering questions in Quora.      ^Only Muslims can understand this. Or someone that understands idek.           That\u2019s all. Adios!~ ",
