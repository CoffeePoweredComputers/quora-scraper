            "answer_text": "After a long wait of 2 years the highly anticipated second season of Mirzapur released. The makers of Mirzapur had set the mood for this show since past 2 months by launching teasers, \u201cWhen is Mirzapur releasing\u201d videos, recaps from every character\u2019s perspective and what not. Even the official trailer gave an impression that the show might keep the fans on the edge of their seats. So was it worth the hype? (Will try to keep it spoiler free) Let's touch upon some major aspects of the movie : The opening sequenceThe opening scene of season 2 shows a scorpion, which is smartly placed to symbolise something. A Scorpion is known to have a need for revenge after being wronged. Thus showing right at the beginning that this season is about revenge.  And immediately after this shot we have a sequence of Guddu\u2019s goons following Munna Tripathi & the season takes of immediately with their face off.   This made my expectations sky rocket & my mind expected a non-linear story to follow. Because a lot of questions were still to be answered. But there is reason why it happens & the slow burn begins. Answers in symbolismThe makers have done a brilliant job by placing hints to portray as to where the season would lead to. Just like the one with the scorpio symbolising revenge, there is another scene in episode 1 where Rati Shankar\u2019s wife explains her son about game plan using a game of chess.    This pretty much sums up the plot of season 2. In terms of symbolic representation, makers have really done well. Character developmentOne of the reason why a show gets popular among the masses is because of their powerful central characters. And more the characters are given a good development arc, the more people will feel like investing themselves in a show. With a shocking death of \u201cBablu\u201d in season 1 finale, people wanted to know how would Guddu mange. And the makers really did justice to his character. GudduWounded both physically and mentally. The character has grown to a great extent. This time around Guddu isn't totally dependent on his brawn. He knows how to use his brain too. There is a particular scene in mid season when Guddu towers both Munna & Sharad convincingly and feels now he has all the confidence to get his enemy. This is the point when we see the old Guddu (with some brain as well).  This is how he reacts later.     GoluUnlike Guddu, Golu was a simple girl who was totally into her studies & confident enough to lead a life with no non-sense. But the \u201cRed wedding\u201d of season 1 changes her life completely & she is affected the most.   There particularly is a scene which shows her peeping into a person\u2019s laptop. This particular scene showcases how life has taken a dramatic turn for her.  From holding a laptop to holding a gun.  Sharad ShuklaRati Shankar Shukla\u2019s son has one of the best character developments in this season. He truly looks like a man on a mission. His transformation from being a person who wanted to be white collar to being a man who wants the throne of Mirzapur is truly a joy to watch. At times he will shock you by the decisions he takes (maybe an effect of his mom explaining him the game of chess). Also characters like Beena, Munna have come a long way. But these 3 impressed me. Slow paceUnlike season 1, this season was a slow burn. The show was just warming up for something big to happen. But it looked like only the trailer was better than the show. There were a lot of moments which developed unnecessarily and had no impact on the story line. The oldest Tripathi\u2019s obsession with the discovery channel continued(but only to show his perverse) which really didn't lay much of an impact like season 1. Except for episode 1 and episode 10, all the other episodes had a slow pace and failed to create an impact. Too many cooks spoil the brothThe trailer gave a good glimpse of the new characters who were going to be involved in season 2. But rather than working well for the show it created a mess. The characters never got into their depth (maybe saving it for the next season). The impact for the charcaters which was supposed to be high failed to create any buzz. But there are couple of surprise characters who can garn some attention in upcoming season. The revenge derailedThe main motive of this season was about Guddu & Golu\u2019s revenge against the Tripathis. But there were moments which diverted from this motive. There were moments in the show which had minor imbalances between the old and new character arcs thus ruining the purpose of the story line. Also the show focused more on politics rather than the mafia syndicate (which was the main reason for season 1\u2032s popularity. The plot revolved heavily around politics mid season & at times made Akhandananad Tripathi Predictable plot lineExcept for a moment or two, entire plot was predictable. One could expect what will happen an episode later just by the flow of things falling in place. Despite of Munna\u2019s impulsive behavior one can tell how will he act, which wasn't a case in season 1. Mirzapur or PurvanchalAnother major difference compared to season 1 was the plot not being majorly revolving around Mirzapur and rather being a battle of who controls Purvanchal. With introduction of Tyagi family (Vijay Raaz & Lilliput) the focus was more on Siwan & Lucknow rather than being on Mirzapur. Hopefully this won't be a problem in season 3. Comic timingThis man makes a come back with brilliant cameos.  This guy in a small screen time does entertain a lot. The comic timing is good & placed very smartly. Credits should be given to the makers for placing such scenes beautifully. For instance in one scene a businessman denies to bow down in front of Dadda Tyagi & this is the scene to follow.   Well Tyagi is short and so are his doors, he makes sure no matter who comes in should bow down. Another one which cracked me up was this one : The owner asks whether the gun is proper or not (else explosion will cut his hand).  And exactly after few frames when he's taking an aim at Guddu this happens :   The gun explodes. Well that's a good placement of antithesis. All in all Mirzapur is a well directed, acted and decently executed piece of work. It's smart, but not the best. So in my opinion it was no where near the fist installment. It was a disappointment and failed to match expectations. Maybe acting is the only saving grave for the series & hopefully it will have a better plot to show in the next season. Thanks!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Warning: Major spoilers ahead!!! Don\u2019t proceed if you have not seen season 2. This will be a thorough review.  Coming from season 1, season 2 had much more characters, and much more tangles in the web of these character storylines, which was a good change to see. Kudos to the Mirzapur team for doing that. They have tried to perform better than the previous season and it shows, which is a plus. This season was all about getting the upper hand. All were trying their best to stay in the top of their game, either by making allies with common interests or trying to remove the competition. That\u2019s it. The complete essence of this season. Foul mouthing does create some \u2018Mirzapur\u2019 style dialogues and meme materials like the first season. Such conversations in regional slang/abuse crack you up and provide the comic touch throughout the season. The episodes from 1\u20138 of season 2 are directed good, and keep you wanting for more. But as you move towards last two episodes, the sharp quality starts to degrade with poor direction and bollywood clich\u00e9s, rife with logical inaccuracies. Following doesn\u2019t make sense at all: Babar knows Sharad and Munna have seen him with Guddu. Still he walks into Maqbool\u2019s house casually, not suspecting him to know? What did the writer\u2019s smoke while writing this? And then Babar again comes to Maqbool\u2019s house from where he had to be rescued when he was kept kidnapped?Maqbool walks into Tripathi mansion with a machine gun, where four guards bow to him in courtyard. He is seen going inside the house. He then just fires an entire magazine on Bauji, yet no other guards come to rescue Bauji? Suddenly all are deaf? And then Beena takes her sweet time to chop Bauji, and no one else from security still gives a damn? What kind of security is at a drug kingpin/ cabinet minister\u2019s house?Sharad tells Kaleen Bhaiya that Munna is coming for his blood. What does he think? That they both will try to kill each other. But what if one of them survives and its Munna? He will know that someone had tipped off Kaleen that he was coming. Munna is not stupid to realize only Sharad knew about this.Kaleen Bhaiya sends all his security away when he knows Munna is coming for him? Why? ah yes, so convenient for everyone to reach to them. And hearing the tons of bullets being shot no one can still hear a damn to come rescue their boss and his son? Are you f***ng kidding me bro?By last two episodes I knew this was not going to be the end of Mirzapur. They wanted to further milk the franchise like \u201913 Reasons Why\u2019. Because hey, why not? Lets keep stretching the plot until there is no substance left and the series becomes something else entirely. Now, Sharad can take the credit for saving Kaleen Bhaiya, Guddu got the gaddi(throne), the Tyagis will come for revenge towards Golu, Guddu and Shabnam need to complete their love story, Kaleen bhaiya will want the gaddi back, Sharad will want the gaddi, Kaleen will know Beena\u2019s betrayal and will make her pay. So there is a throne, and everyone kills and dies for it, and this continues for one more season hopefully. I still think they could have ended the series here, and with better direction. That being said, I rate season 2 : 6/10 Thanks Alisha Khan for suggesting below additional possibilities: Maqbool will become leiutenant of Guddu.Madhuri will take everything in her power to get revenge for Munna\u2019s death to make Guddu\u2019s life a living hell.My review of first season:Yatin Hiwarkar's answer to What is your review of the new \"Amazon Prime\" show \"Mirzapur\"?

            "answer_text": "Mirzapur is one of the rare Indian series which was able to create euphoria for crude, carnal and gore fantasies very similar to \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 (Tripathis - Lannisters, Pandits - Starks, Yadavs - Targaryens, others - Shuklas, Tyagis, Lalas etc) I am a big fan of season 1 and season 2 though great fell a tad bit short of phase 1 glory. Character Arcs which went well Sharad Shukla - makes a strong entry with his exceptional manoeuvring skills setting the stage for the season. lots of unconventional moves like accepting Munna\u2019s authority without any pushback, territory reorganisation for his trade groups to push them into submission without bloodshed. I don\u2019t think his arc is completely evolved in the season and I have bigger hopes for the next season 2. Madhuri Yadav - Strong character arc gaining power over the course of the season. She brings a lot of freshness to the power tussle, as well as balances the rustic patriarchy with her positive personna. Acting was spot on, especially her relationship with Munna  3. Munna Tripathi - evolution of Munna Tripathi from an emotinally unstable byproduct of repeated power denials, to an emotionally connected husband and eventually a loving son and King of Mirzapur was heartening. His character evolution was the highlight of the season 2 for me  4. Robin - An interesting new addition, tremendous screen presence with a becalming style and ability make an impact with subtlety. His charming personality did caught everyone\u2019s attention especially with the opening scene with Babloo  5. Beena Tripathi - she evolves to the next level with her manipulation skills now deviating towards \u2018kings landing\u2019. Whether her super manipulative responses to Bauji or her clear use of Raju or collaboration with Babloo gang. She really takes it all out on the Tripathis. Her butchering scene of Bauji kind of closed her arc too but she had one final bullet in her arsenal  6. Kaleen Bhaiya - Nobody can match the style of our favourite kaleen bhaiya. This series cannot even exist without its protagonist star Kaleen bhaiya. He portrays an extreme level of collectiveness in his demeanour , perfect decision making, his balanced love for his son and his respect for his Bauji. He does all the bad things but still audience remains invested in him and captivated by his charm. Reason for all things right with this series  What could have been better? Bringing the sensual aspects which so delicately balanced patriarchy, this was something which was the hallmark of Mirzapur season 1 brand . The reason why we were able to accept Beena/others manipulative power was due to season 1 context, which so clearly drew that picture on character arcs, the following left a lot to be desired in my opinion Guddu Pandit- he took forever to recover from his injuries, just slowed the start of the season. I was looking more of a hulk fight at climax which would have taken the Tripathis by storm. Nothing , Zilch , anti-climax for all the slow rubbish build up  Golu - people may disagree but her role was also way less pronounced than it could have been. Her arc with Tyagis was completely off relevance Tyagis - why were they here ? Maybe question for season 3, but a big liability for season 2 Shabnam- she could have played a greater role, script promised us an complex triangle with Guddu and Golu but then nothing really followed through. She definitely had good screen presence Maurya - Such good character build up in season 1, then collapse of the arc, season 2 again did the exact same thing with such talented actor. Script could have given him definitely something more. He is the biggest reason why I think there was a definite room for improvement in season 2  ",

            "answer_text": "Just finished Mirzapur 2. I would say the success of series can be gauged by the fact that if you are hungry for more at the end of a season. Unfortunately, I did not felt the same. I don't want a Mirzapur3 and probably it won't come.  I was always of the opinion in order to extend another season , the end of season 1 was twisted. Else , Guddu and Bablu couple have easily outsmarted Munna Bhaiya in marriage reception and would have killed him and the series could have ended. Anyhow, let's get to Season 2. For me it was ok but the release time was good. An extended weekend due to festivities. Somehow, it seems they just get people/characters killed just for the heck of it. I don't want to reveal the plot because it may make watching the series bit dull, but once you watch you would feel many characters were killed or shown murdered without any need. Tbh I had read reviews on Quora after 1st episode itself . Since 1st episode was slow and reviewer were already saying the series is a dampner compared to season1 and I already knew the season end; my expectations from the series were reduced and I had just gone ahead with the season2 plainly watching it as loyal audience of Mirzapur1. Games of Wasseypur 1 was super and 2nd part was even better. That\u2019s how one should get audience glued. Mirzapur1 was Super and Mirzapur2 was not bad. Actually, in Mirzapur1 they were building characters and in season2 you already knew the characters and they were predictable. Season makers did add few new interesting characters but they just seems to have been inserted forcefully rather than through the plot. It still can be watched for sure but don't expect that the makers have created the magic of season1 ,rather they failed miserably. Why can't we have series where the quality don't get deteriorated season after season. Those who have already watched - Would you want to see Mirzapur 3? ",

            "answer_text": "More Setup, Less Chaos.  Mirzapur season 2 was marketed as a revenge saga with introduction of several talented actors playing new characters. But it's more setting up for a bigger, violent and revengeful season 3. There are many good plot points and bad plot points in Mirzapur 2. And that's the biggest issue with the season. The \u2018most good aspect' of Mirzapur 2 is character involvement of Guddu & Munna. Guddu involves from an uncontrollable physique to an injured and pacifying still dangerous person. He also ends up forming a romantic relationship with Shabnam- Lala's daughter.  On the other hand, Munna become less violent and shows his human side after his arranged marriage to CM's daughter Madhuri Yadav for whom he grows a soft corner in his heart.  And by far he has given the finest performance and remained the most attractive part of this season. But the writer's approach in same way backfired for other characters. Focussing on Dimpy's character and love interest stretched this season and it had been a complete disaster.  It felt there wasn't a need for her love interest and especially with such stretched scenes. Similarly, Vijay Verma's character who played son to a Bihar Bahubali have been not properly developed. And icing this cake, is show's most legendary actor Pankaj Tripathi who played Kaleen Bhaiya. Previously, Kaleen Bhaiya was like thunder in a bottle or a force to fear. But in this season he was transformed into more into a comedic landscape. And it gives you a laugh, but, angers you at most of the point. Another issue with this season is poor action choreography. It makes you wait with a promise that something really a chaotic end is coming near you. Just like season 1. It does but with a very poorly designed action. Conclusion: Mirzapur 2 is more stretched but it is also setting you up more something very bigger. I don't think it deserves the criticism, they're getting. ",

            "answer_text": "If you liked the first Season, then you'll love this one. Here's my take: Mirzapur Season 2: The more things change, the more they stay the same. Aftermath of Season 1:   After that shocking cliffhanger of an ending, which featured a literal red wedding (or reception), Mirzapur Season 1 proved that no character is safe in this show, and that trend continues with the second edition as well. The makers marketed the hell out of the second season as a revenge drama, featuring Ali Fazal's Guddu Pandit /w Shweta Tripathi's Gajgamini Gupta a.k.a. Golu at odds with the Tripathis (Pankaj Tripathi and Divyendu Sharma as Kaleen Bhaiya and Munna, respectively).   Political Drama:  However, the first few episodes established that this was more than just a revenge drama. With the introduction of fresh characters and various plotlines, Mirzapur Season 2 effortlessly establishes itself as a political drama in disguise. Kaleen Bhaiya has a lot on his mind other than Mirzapur's throne. Munna has a lot on his mind too, but nothing as much as Mirzapur's throne. Meanwhile, Guddu and Golu have their targets locked and loaded.  The New Players:   The slew of new characters could've bogged down the main plotline of the show, except it doesn't. Characters like Sharad, Robin, the Tyagis, the Yadavs, etc. add a much needed sense of urgency to the show. The power dynamics constantly change hands in this banger of a season, and it always keeps you guessing what's next in store.   Female Characters:  Unlike the first season, where the female characters felt pretty one-dimensional and didn't have much to do expect play damsels in distress, Season 2 improves drastically in this department. The female characters, while still kind of outnumbered and outgunned by the male characters, easily shine through. Characters like Golu and Beena have a lot going on, and they play pivotal roles in the grand scheme as well. Another character, CM's daughter Madhuri Yadav, makes a great deal of impact on the Tripathi family dynamic.  Thrills:   As expected, the second season of Mirzapur isn't particularly short on thrills. Guns, violence, sex and chaos are still at the forefront of it all. The dialogues are sharp as ever, and some characters which we thought weren't exactly that vital, were given tremendous payoffs.    Conclusion:    Mirzapur adds a slew of characters, while giving the older ones a bit more depth, without compromising anything. Infact, it improves upon every major aspect of the show that made it immensely popular in the first place. High on fan service as well as sincere storytelling, Mirzapur Season 2 is bound to satisfy its riotous fanbase. ",

            "answer_text": "Trapped in a melee of forces much larger than itself, a venomous creature is stunned into seeming inaction. Its ultimate survival is an outcome not of some deft maneuvering but rather of fate (or as it is often referred to these days, dumb luck). With season 2 of Mirzapur opening to this arid dreamscape and expanding its purview from Purvanchal to all of UP and the neighboring Bihar, viewers might have expected the story to unfold in a similarly elevated plane. Caught in the crossfire between the country\u2019s real power-players, our heavy-hitters from season 1 would stumble and scurry, their rivalries, wounds and injustices all falling by the wayside. However, this is not the story that season 2 chooses to tell. It is not as much an ambitious expansion of its predecessor as it is an able extension. Once you accept that, there is much to enjoy about this latest installment. The trademark features that put Mirzapur on the map all return. Tense situations abound and often resolve in well-choreographed, violent set-pieces. The crafty dialogue continues to inject cinematic flair and zany, situational humor into casual, everyday speak. The best exponent of this quality is the returning Divyendu Sharma, this season\u2019s standout star as the capricious, aptly-named man-child, Munna. The universe of colorful personalities expands satisfyingly and every new addition makes for a delightful foil to the show\u2019s existing cast. Isha Talwar (as the political scion Madhuri Yadav), Vijay Verma (of Pink and Gully Boy fame) and even Priyanshu Painyuli (as Robin, the glib money manager), all turn in assured, memorable performances. It is in the sweet, unhurried sequences between its new-age men and women that Mirzapur and its showrunners keep demonstrating a healthy, level-headed maturity that has so eluded the Hindi film industry of late. The primary problem of season 1 \u2014 the comically convenient staging and resolution of certain arcs \u2014 is present here too, never more so than when a political figure loses his seat. A cold, vengeful scion who was touted as an emerging cerebral figure last season is overshadowed by other characters and becomes largely inconsequential. But like a skilled magician, Mirzapur deploys its arsenal of titillation and pacey storytelling in combination with the goodwill it has earned, to distract the audience from the occasional misstep. It is neither a great nor mediocre show but in a world strife with polarized stances on the same, tired stories, Mirzapur\u2019s biggest achievement is that it remains an original oddity, impossible to shoehorn into any existing box. As we once again wait anxiously for the next season, we can only wonder if the characters we love (and love to hate) will be relegated to meandering, insignificant scorpions in a larger game or remain demigods who leave behind a barren, bloody landscape in their relentless pursuit of each other.  Spoiler-filled observations Kulbhushan Kharbanda\u2019s Bauji continued to be Mirzapur\u2019s most poorly-written character. His \u201chonor\u201d-fueled rape of daughter-in-law Beena in the season 1 finale came out of nowhere and his devolution into a senile, lecherous predator this season was similarly illogical. Also eye-roll worthy was him falling for Beena\u2019s flattery, despite purportedly being a master strategist. Despite all of this, the scene in which Beena murders him in cold blood is satisfying.Beena\u2019s agreement with Guddu that he would accede the throne of Mirzapur to her son when he came of age is so silly, it\u2019s laughable.Given its mainstream appeal, I am hopeful about Mirzapur\u2019s ability to inform and improve the popular discourse around taboo topics in India. The nonchalant, non-preachy manner in which the show normalizes healthy sexual attitudes, feminist stances and inter religion/caste relationships, while simultaneously chastising bad behavior clearly, is a good template for subsequent shows to follow.Chhote using a commonplace leather belt rather than the usual fetishized objects to satisfy Golu\u2019s S&M cravings was rather discomforting. This is not a judgment as I do not know if real-world S&M enthusiasts find this portrayal acceptable or misrepresenting.Dadda Tyagi having his entire office tailored to his measurements, was a power statement unlike any other, and a worthy addition to the show\u2019s most memorable scenes.Everything about Munna\u2019s death was fantastic. The fact that he finally gets the respect he had striven for from his dad and his trademark chuckle when he realizes Guddu is going to kill him exactly how he had killed Bablu were both perfect touches. Killing off Munna cements Mirzapur\u2019s status as a series taking bold risks with bonafide twists. Divyendu Sharma was a consistent scene stealer this season, and I hope that the show doesn\u2019t rue its decision to part ways with him.Vijay Verma\u2019s Chhotu could be what fills Munna\u2019s void but it remains to be seen how much of Chhotu\u2019s playful personality permeates through when he\u2019s forced to live life as the boring Bade.",

            "answer_text": "Good always triumphs the evil, and there\u2019s always a morning ahead of a dark night. The makers of Mirzapur preach the same in the show\u2019s anticipated season 2. The hyper-realism of the show doesn\u2019t go away neither does its wariness. However, entertainment and quirky dynamics between its characters take a backseat this time. (Spoiler Alert)  Mirzapur 2 begins exactly where season 1 ended. An injured Guddu Pandit (Ali Fazal), along with Golu (Shweta Tripathi), is set on a journey of revenge. Munna Tripathi (Divyendu Sharma) had killed his pregnant wife and shot his brother\u2019s head open at a wedding where even the innocent groom was murdered. Guddu, as expected, shall consider himself half-dead now, and focus on building a new path that takes him directly inside the \u2018Tripathi Kothi\u2019 and to \u2018Mirzapur ki gaddi\u2019 that Kaleen Bhaiyaa (Pankaj Tripathi) plans to hand over to his son soon. While one expects Guddu\u2019s plans to be well-fetched and his demeanour more challenging and unpredictable, he appears a little bit defeated and in a state of mourning most of the time. The quirk with which Guddu Bhaiyaa established himself as the \u2018lion of Mirzapur\u2019 seems missing in season 2. As the episodes progress, one thinks of Golu taking Babloo\u2019s place in Guddu\u2019s life by assisting him with her sharp mind but that doesn\u2019t happen. Even in those scenes when it appears that the two are mean to operate as a team, they look like far ends of a strand trying too hard to build a partnership. The makers, however, show a thoughtful contrast in establishing the transition and rise of the female characters. From the moment Golu learns to pull the trigger to the scene when Veena Tripathi decides to \u2018survive\u2019 \u2013 it seems that the women in Mirzapur 2 are finally not ready to give up. Phrases like \u2018mardon ke beech auratein nahi bolti\u2019 or \u2018aurat se goli nahi khayege\u2018 are used more in season 2. Perhaps to emphasise better on the lopsided power structures that are run by patriarchy first and then by the set of rules the one sitting on the \u2018gaddi\u2019 has created. More actors join season 2 but no one makes up for Babloo Pandit\u2019s (Vikrant Massey) absence in the story. Isha Talwar, Vijay Verma, Lilliput, Priyanshu Painyuli, Meghna Malik, and Anjum Sharma lead their own parallel stories but it all appears frivolous and irrelevant as the season progresses towards its end. Isha, though, manages to pull off her part well, by establishing a strong character which is capable of making her own choices and leading her own path in a world driven by gun-holding, gory-seeking, power-thirsty men. And then there\u2019s the character arch of Veena Tripathi which is almost celebratory. She, with her lost existence in the Tripathi household, appears more fearless and smarter than the smartness of all men combined in her family. Priyanshu\u2019s Robin also leaves a lasting impression and one is always thinking about a certain mystery that he promises to bring into the story. Only there\u2019s no mystery and you are left wanting to see more of him. Thank you for reading :) :) ",

I know the above one-liner must have caught hold of u, so before moving further- LET ME BE CLEAR: DISCLAIMER: 1. Major Spoilers Ahead 2. Though I tried my best to not be biased here(like everyone else)\u2026.. But being a human being, we obviously can\u2019t deny our bias ness\u2026\u2026\u2026 \u201cIF U FIND ANY BIASNESS, FEEL FREE TO POINT OUT\u201d in comments\u2026\u2026 Before moving ahead toward ratings, have an overview: OVERVIEW: Starting with Plot, In one word, the storyline is somewhat \u201cslowish\u201d. Unlike the previous season, this time it moves forward gradually, to accommodate too many new unnecessary characters- be it DaDDA TYAGI or ROBIN. However, the writers must have got their own reasons for doing so- nevertheless, to create the hype for upcoming seasons. Although they are quite successful in creating that hype for the next session, doing so they did disappoint the larger audience, who were all set to get on to \u201cthe revenge saga\u201d, which was delayed intentionally to introduce new characters & their perspective. It seems as if the writer forgot the main motive of season 2- the BADLA\u2026\u2026\u2026 Additionally, what disgusted the audience further was GUDDU\u2019s everlasting injuries, MAQBOOL\u2019s dumbness & Yes BAUJI sticking to the same discovery channel(\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude00just jocking, chill)\u2026\u2026 But, yes apart from slowness, other things were just PERFECT, be it SHARAD replacing BABLOO\u2019s intelligence, BAUJI\u2019s everlasting intimate intentions, KALEENS\u2019s calmness, GOLU\u2019s dominance, MADHURI becoming CM or MUNNA\u2019s mixed \u201cchildish yet wicked\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude01\u201d behavior \u2026.. Interestingly, this season was single-handedly dominated by women & of course, without their beauty with brains, it would have become difficult for the writer to get the story a perfect end. Likewise, BENNA\u2019s survival in last season is justified accordingly here, with BAUJI being chopped( it does seem satisfying: CHOPPING of BAUJI) & what seemed more satisfying was seeing to first ever KALEEN\u2019s helplessness being pissed off by MADHURI, remember that scene when he dreamt of becoming a CM himself(just see his f**ked up face ones again). Similarly, GOLU\u2019s dominance over TYAGIs & BENNA\u2019s betrayal and BADLA makes women the true gamechanger of this season\u2026\u2026. Though the storyline was all the way quite predictable, what added to its misery the most was its eventual slow start & unconvincing hurried-up end in the last two episodes (yes, in the last episode, it felt as if writers were in a hurry to end the season). Doing so, they ended up putting an unconvincing & unsatisfying end to their main motive- THE BADLA; gorier the end would have been, the spicier( & satisfying for our GUDDU\u2019s fans) it would have felt!!!!!!!!!!!! Certainly, it has a mix of good & bad shares of thoughts of netizens. But, all in all, it is perfect as in the overall development of the story & its character. \u201cWith less BHOUKAL( than the previous season) & more of a mind game thing\u201d- it does catch hold of u for a single sitting\u2026.. Although everyone has their own set of apprehensions, from my side it is worth the single sitting ( go for it, and thank me later\u2026\u2026. bCZ it is rarer, seeing to the gradual decrease in levels of BOLLYWOOD MOVIES- where character development & its share is amiss)\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. I do hope, till now u must have got a hold of my taste. With it, let's move to the rating part>:) I have divided my rating(out of 5) into five major parts: PLOT(Storyline): 4/5\u2026Less BHOUKAL, more of mind games\u2026\u2026 Though one marks deducted for its slow start, hurried end, unnecessary new intros, less gory, & IMP unsatisfying ending GUDDU\u2019s revenge as it was less blood shadier\u2026.. CHARACTER: 5/5\u2026Character development is what the series manages to do justice to\u2026\u2026. breaking all records, it does fetch u a desi feeling\u2026\u2026. Few masterstrokes are SHARAD replacing BABLOO\u2019s intelligence, BAUJI\u2019s everlasting intimate intentions, KALEENS\u2019s calmness, GOLU\u2019s dominance, MADHURI becoming CM or MUNNA\u2019s mixed \u201cchildish yet wicked\u201d behavior \ud83d\ude01(see my overview)\u2026.. MUNNA & KALEEN are obviously the undisputed best actors of the series\u2026\u2026 GRAPHICS(Editing * Sound): 5/5\u2026..It is undoubtedly the best, far superior to its counterpart series & movies\u2026\u2026.. DIALOGUE PLAY: 3/5\u2026.. though it may seem perfect at the start, none-the-less it loses its spell afterward\u2026. frequent & exaggerated overuse of cuss words(the so-called GALIS) calls for its criticism\u2026.. GORE: 4/5\u2026. as I already told it is less BHOUKALY from last season, I wish it could have been better\u2026\u2026.. Others: 5/5\u2026.showing lesser intimate scenes are obviously a positive of this season, unlike last season + KALEEN\u2019s stillness & calmness is also quick learning of season\u2026.talking of life lessons from this type of series is obviously funny(thus, I didn\u2019t count it in rating here) OVERALL SCORE: 26/30\u2026\u2026 OVERALL RATING: 4.3/5\u2026\u2026 Waiting eagerly for next season along with u all- will surely finish it in a single go\u2026\u2026.. With CM herself along with SHARAD, KALEEN & TYAGIS, it would be heartening to see how will GUDDU manage along with GOLU & BENNA both his love SHABNAM & the throne of MIRZAPUR\u2026\u2026. SINGING OFF\u2026. A TRUE MIRZAPUR FAN ",

            "answer_text": "Finally, the wait is over and the most awaited season of the famous Amazon prime Original web series \u201cMirzapur\u201d is back with the second season creating a buzz around the Nation and probably around the globe. After the first season, the viewers had a lot of expectations from the makers about this coming season, and the makers have lived up to the expectations of the viewers because this season has got enough ammo and fire in it to keep its audiences hooked to their couches. Picking up from where the first season left us, this 10 episode web series is another roller coaster ride of emotions which are drenched in enmity, politics, greed, ambition and a small-town crime plot with an initial slow start but a lot of rush towards the end trying to catch up on a lot things in a less time. In the beginning of the series, we get to see two different sides of the story, one where Kaleen Bhaiya who is also the uncrowned king of Mirzapur swears to make his son Munna Tripathi into a capable leader and a ruler to carry out his legacy. On the other hand there is Guddu Pandit who is struggling every day to heal from his wounds physically and emotionally after the loss of his brother Bablu and the love of his life Sweety. During this journey to recovery times have not only changed for Guddu but also for Dimpy and Golu who happen to play an important part in preparing Guddu for the ultimate fight of Mirzapur to avenge the death of their loved ones. Besides that talking about change, Guns have replaced college books and blood has replaced NailPaint for these girls. Living by the lines of \u201cAb Katte Ke Saath dimaag bhi chalega\u201d this season has more to just violence and bloodshed. Our characters are seen to be very keen on getting ulterior motives fulfilled by using their brains more than their strength and power be it Munna\u2019s motive to become a capable ruler in his father\u2019s eyes or Guddu and Golu\u2019s motive of revenge for their loved ones. Talking about the characters of this season one and the ap test lead role with aloof expressions having a normal charm to connect with the audiences have been Pankaj Tripathi. His witty and sarcasm-filled one-liners have been by far the best. Ali Fazal as Guddu Pandit is in his usual beefed-up avatar and not doing anything more than his usual to convince the audiences. Divyendu Sharma aka Munna Tripathi, the spoilt brat is probably the most fun-to-watch character responsible for all the ruckus around Mirzapur. This season has undoubtedly become a showdown for women, giving them more chances to express themselves. Whether it comes to taking out the rage or changing the inheritance of the Mizrapur\u2019s Throne. Women in this season were vulnerable yet showcased inner strength, and played the major roles in establishing destinies of other characters. Talking about the direction and the production quality of this season was far better from the last season. The effects, background score and the filming of the season was done in a fine manner. Summing up Mirzapur, season 2 is a deadly combination of power, revenge and Politics, that came to an interesting end forming engrossing allies and compulsive rivalries.Just like other Revenge and small-town Crime plot dramas this web series Mirzapur \u201c2\u201d hits the aims in the right direction and hits the target in delivering an intense and a spine chilling tale of intense rivalries.

            "answer_text": " Ratings:- 3/5 The wait is over! Because the trailer of \u2018Mirzapur Season 2\u2019 has finally premiered. Mirzapur season 2 is one of the Prime Video\u2019s most awaited and most famous crime series. Well, the series premiere on 23 October. Plot As we know, In Season 1, the full game of the throne of Mirzapur was shown. In this time, the Kaleen Bhaiya was in command. His son Munna (Divyendu) wants to save this throne but also wants to take a weapon. In this entire game, Guddu Pandit\u2019s brother Bablu Pandit i.e. Vikrant Massey, and Guddu\u2019s wife Sweety Gupta i.e. Shriya Pilgaonkar dies. Now Guddu will revenge his wife and brother\u2019s death this season. And Sweety\u2019s sister Shweta Tripathi supports in his mission. Both of them are very angry and they are ready to cross every border to avenge the death. This time, four lead characters Kaleen Bhaiya, Munna, Guddu, Golu, and other characters were introduced. Munna has made up his mind to sit on the throne of Mirzapur this time. He invented a new rule according to which the person who sits on the throne can change the rules at any time. However, Guddu and Golu are burning in the fire of vengeance. Guddu does not think even once to bring the enemy to death.  He does not back down from giving painful death to the enemy. Together with Golu, he sets out to eliminate his enemies, but his mind will not calm down just by changing. He wants the throne of Mirzapur along with vengeance. Apart from these four, this time Ratishankar Shukla, who entered Jaunpur and was killed by Guddu Pandit. His son Sharad will also enter politics to get the throne of Mirzapur. So, who will rule Mirzapur, to know who will be the throne of Mirzapur, you have to wait for Mirzapur Season 2 released. Review Screenplay Where the story of the previous season ended, the story of the second season begins. Like the first season, in this season also you will find plenty of guns, goons, and abuses in Mirzapur. Now the battle of Mirzapur has turned into a more bloody war. Munna and Guddu are at the center of the story like last time, and this time you will know so much that you will also think that if some of them did not know then the story could have gone ahead. UP tones Dialogues are fabulous. These dialogues full of abuse and profanity may seem objectionable to you but without them, it is not possible to show reality. It is a male-dominated setup in which patriarchy is repeated, men are decision-makers, and women are more or less considered domestic. There is some integrity to each character. The show brings inertia and a feeling to the story that easily ignores most efforts in this genre. The novelty factor in the story is minimal, although the story, with strong packaging, helps to save packaging day. Doesn\u2019t add anything new to the story. In this story of the crime world, the police are the last and the strongest. Overall, the second season of Mirzapur, by adding short stories, attacks the main plot of Mirzapur.  Performance When you bring in big actors, the effect of the show can be increased to a great extent and the same thing about Mirzapur series makes it special. Pankaj Tripathi probably gets the least number of dialogues this time, but when he descends, he descends so well that it is a masterclass about the importance of screen presence in the performance. Desperate to take over the reins of Mirzapur from his father, Divyendu has a lively screen as a young gangster. He has performed shoulder to shoulder with Tripathi. Ali Fazal seems to be getting stuck in this season. Shweta Tripathi Sharma is hardly disappointed in her performance. Vijay Verma is excellent, though it is tiring to see him playing one gangster after another. Kulbhushan Kharbanda, Sheeba Chaddha, Rajesh Tailang, Liliput, and Pramod Pathak did commendable work. Direction The writer-director did not take this into consideration in the story because this time the characters are less afraid, more are dying. Mirzapur, with the artistry and newness that director duo Gurmeet Singh and Mihir Desai created in the first season, is missing in the second season. It is mostly felt here that it is just an attempt to capitalize on the success of the first season. Should you watch it or not? The artistic and newness that Mirzapur created in the first season is missing in the second season. It is mostly felt here that it is just an attempt to capitalize on the success of the first season. Due to good performance, there is little power in Mirzapur-2. Cast Now that Vikrant Messi and Shriya Pilgaonkar\u2019s characters killed in the first season, the fans are going to miss both of them in season 2. But fans are going to see some new faces this time. Vijay Verma, Priyanshu Penyuli, and Isha Talwar are going to be new entries. Apart from this, Pankaj Tripathi, Ali Fazal, Divyendu Sharma, Shweta Tripathi Sharma, Rasika Dugal, Harshita Shekhar Gaur, Amit Sial, Anjum Sharma, Sheeba Chaddha, Manu Rishi Chadha, and Rajesh Tailang will be returning from the first season.

            "answer_text": " Mirzapur 2 begins exactly where season 1 ended. An injured Guddu Pandit (Ali Fazal), along with Golu (Shweta Tripathi), is set on a journey of revenge. Munna Tripathi (Divyendu Sharma) had killed his pregnant wife (Shreya Pilgaonkar) and shot his brother\u2019s head open at a wedding where even the innocent groom was murdered. Guddu, as expected, shall consider himself half-dead now, and focus on building a new path that takes him directly inside the \u2018Tripathi Kothi\u2019 and to \u2018Mirzapur ki gaddi\u2019 that Kaleen Bhaiyaa (Pankaj Tripathi) plans to hand over to his son soon. While one expects Guddu\u2019s plans to be well-fetched and his demeanor more challenging and unpredictable, he appears a little bit defeated and in a state of mourning most of the time. The quirk with which Guddu Bhaiyaa established himself as the \u2018lion of Mirzapur\u2019 seems missing in season 2. As the episodes progress, one thinks of Golu taking Babloo\u2019s place in Guddu\u2019s life by assisting him with her sharp mind but that doesn\u2019t happen. Even in those scenes when it appears that the two are mean to operate as a team, they look like far ends of a strand trying too hard to build a partnership. The makers, however, show a thoughtful contrast in establishing the transition and rise of the female characters. From the moment Golu learns to pull the trigger to the scene when Veena Tripathi decides to \u2018survive\u2019 \u2013 it seems that the women in Mirzapur 2 are finally not ready to give up. Phrases like \u2018mardon ke beech auratein nahi bolti\u2019 or \u2018aurat se goli nahi khayege\u2018 are used more in season 2. Perhaps to emphasize better on the lopsided power structures that are run by patriarchy first and then by the set of rules the one sitting on the \u2018gaddi\u2019 has created. More actors join season 2 but no one makes up for Babloo Pandit\u2019s (Vikrant Massey) absence in the story. Isha Talwar, Vijay Verma, Lilliput, Priyanshu Painyuli, Meghna Malik, and Anjum Sharma lead their own parallel stories but it all appears frivolous and irrelevant as the season progresses towards its end. Isha, though, manages to pull off her part well, by establishing a strong character which is capable of making her own choices and leading her own path in a world driven by gun-holding, gory-seeking, power-thirsty men. And then there\u2019s the character arch of Veena Tripathi which is almost celebratory. She, with her lost existence in the Tripathi household, appears more fearless and smarter than the smartness of all men combined in her family. Priyanshu\u2019s Robin also leaves a lasting impression and one is always thinking about a certain mystery that he promises to bring into the story. Only there\u2019s no mystery and you are left wanting to see more of him. Source-india.com ",

            "answer_text": "In Single line: Poor plot and abysmal motive driven script. Dialogues are not thoroughly reviewed. Too many new characters added without due research on their part and each struggling for screen space. I felt producers got confused in whether to take proper acting from characters or throw a few cards to add some specific target audience e.g. Feminists who were largely ignored in this patriarchal drama.Too many new characters were added none being properly researched - such as Tyagis from Siwan. Really? You should have at least chosen the surnames as per demographic presence.3. Sharad could have been given more power scripts - he joined Tripathi\u2019s and not even super senior Tripathi even doubted his inclusion in squad. The character was too mature but here this was not even given screen space. 4. Season shows \u201cso-called\u201d throne of Mirzapur >> CM\u2019s chair. That was tad unrealistic actually very unrealistic. 5. Guddu, who was a man of action in season-1 retorts of man who speaks much does less this season. This was only possible by plot\u2019s sheer dents. 6. Munna does justice to his part and is equally flamboyant on the screen. 7. Chacha ( actually Bho* wale chacha ) lights up the screen only in few stills but Kaaleen bhaiya maintains the same-old grave thoughts-laden demeanour. 8. Was killing of Lalit ( aide of Munna) realistic in CMs chamber? What does this scene intends to show? Overall: A disappointment to those who savoured Season 1. Read my review at end of Season 1 too.

            "answer_text": "Mirzapur season 2 has handled the expectation and hype of season1 in a reasonable way. But it has failed to deliver the momentum created in season 1. Honestly, I was always fearful about it. I think creative team of Mirzapur hurried to create season 2 given how impatient fans were. Mirzapur season 1 as in words of Pankaj Tripathi was like Mahabharat. The story line was amazing and screenplay was \u2018beautifully\u2019 flawless. To create something which could go along with season 1, would take some years and luck ! That was not possible given how easily fans forget things now days. Season 2\u2019s story line tried to cover too much and couldn\u2019t hold them together. Some clich\u00e9 I have observed which turned me off. Akhnadanand Tripathi is not just same character we hoped after season 1, specially after how he boldly declared he is not just businessman but a Bahubali in season 1. He is easily frustrated. Some of his dialogues were unnecessary and I could feel, writers are trying to turn a Bahubali into a humors villain of 90\u2019s Hindi cinema. He is loosing his control over Mirzapur but you just don\u2019t understand why. Guddu Pandit lives in just outskirt of Mirzapur and all Akhananand could do is to ask Makbul- \u201c\u092a\u0924\u093e \u0915\u0930\u094b \u201d. He or even Munna never tries to seriously chase Guddu and I couldn\u2019t just digest that. One specialty of season 1 was importance of locations and city of Mirzapur itslef. In season 2 there is constant switch on/off between locations, and writers just leave it to audience to grasp it. That doesn\u2019t happen. Whatever the place is , Bihar, Mirzapur,Balia, Gajipur, names are taken randomly (almost) and locations seems same irrespective of what subtitles says. The direct connection between Kaleen Bhaiya and Mirzapur is lost and I felt that he is just a businessman who has monopoly over a illegal business and not a Bahubali like he claims to be. It would be nice if Mirzapur 2\u2019\u2019s Kaleen Bhaiya could take a lesson from Ramadhir singh ( \u201c\u0905\u092a\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0918\u0941\u092e\u094b \u0914\u0930 \u0932\u094b\u0917\u094b \u0915\u094b \u092a\u094d\u0930\u094b\u0924\u094d\u0938\u093e\u0939\u0928 \u0926\u094b \u201c). The story of Golu and Chhote doesn\u2019t look genuine and it is byproduct of the fact that season 2 tries to cover too much. The last scene of Tyagi families seems over dramatic due to the fact that writers had never tried to explore the family story or chemistry between its members. But Tyagis are important if you follow the writer\u2019s view ( and you have to do it many times). Guddu pandit\u2019s follow up story is good but in this season he is just too invincible. And he gives a reason - \u201c \u0915\u0930\u0924\u0947 \u0928\u0939\u0940 \u0939\u094b \u091c\u093e\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u201c. Having said that his story and character seem legit. He is a young angry villain and he is bound to live up to that image. The most accomplished character of season 2 is Munna Bhaiya and he is the reason I could hook to my screen for almost 8 hours ( in two sessions ). His character and story remains intact. He is same childish bad boy who is a chutiya ( you know ) but you can\u2019t just ignore him. Credit goes to Divyendu Sharma who has once again livesd every shade of his character. The story runs in bits and pieces. The whole election drama once again just runs in background and the fact that CM could save his chair just because violence in Mirzapur or Purvanchal came under control seems clich\u00e9 ( remember you have to follow writers view again). I feel that if writers hadn\u2019t try to cover too much, and didn\u2019t worry about introducing so many new characters, they would able to give a depth to the story. ",

            "answer_text": "FINALLY !!! FINALLY !!! WAIT HAS BEEN OVER NOW  Pic source - Google Images. Here, I come with the review of Mirzapur season 2. My answer will be different on some aspects. Rather than giving a single word to the series like TERRIFIC or CRAP, I will say that it depends what you are expecting from this season. Some might be expecting to end story in this season itself. But, leaving the story again in a cliffhanger they might be upset with the series. Some might not have much expectations. They might have liked or disliked. Some might be expecting more BHOUKAL. They will surely be upset. This season is focused more on mind games. Here we go. I will be reviewing the series mainly on the aspects of plot, characters, editing, sounds, extras. Plot : 9/10 \u2026. In one word AMAZING !!! Be it start, mid or end. I am satisfied. Story is beautifully written. Less BHOUKAL but more focus on mind games. 1 mark deducted as the plot was bit slow. Characters : 10/10 \u2026. This is the only segment in the series having no flaws. Every character has a significant development. Acting has been given justice. It is different from a typical Bollywood film ( There is a hero then there are others). New charecters have added spice. I think they are added for the new season. Be it Dadda Tyagi or CM\u2019s daughter, they don\u2019t have much significance in this season. But, they will be more important in upcoming season. Special mention for Munna. His acting is perfect. Editing : 10/10 \u2026. Comparing with typical bollywood film, the graphics are far superior. The graphics are comparable to hollywood films. VFX has been used wisely and perfectly. Sound : 10/10 \u2026. Remember the iconic opening theme song. This was super. Various Background musics in different situations. Balanced use of music is there. Extras : 6/10 \u2026. Here, I will be evaluating on the basis of profanity, explicit scenes, gore, life lessons. This can go deep. Profanity : This is flawed. They are overusing it. Very frequent use of cuss words. This does not signify anything. It feels like words are overused. Cuss words are necessary for this type of series but this is very much. Explicit Scenes : I think this is step down from season 1. Unlike Season 1, when they are openly showing intimate scenes, we have not seen any intimate scene this season. This segment is only working on the basis of implications. This is positve. Gore : This is crime based series. So, we must expect more gore. Altough less voilence than season 1 but bearable. I expect more. If you are saying it is crime based series, voilence is spice here. I like spicy foods. It is completely personal. Life Lessons : This will be going completely philosphical. I mean we are trying to find life lessons from a crime based series ! Most characters are dark. Most characters are going by heart rather than using mind. Altough exceptions exist like Kaleen, Golu, Sharad and Benna. These are true masterminds. What hurts me most is that Guddu and Munna who were main characters are like dumb and mostly rely on emotions. Wether it is Maqbool\u2019s loyalty or Guddu\u2019s love, there is still something to learn from individual characters. Final Score - 45/50 9 stars out of 10 At last, they will be successful in creating hype for season 3. Feel free to criticize me in the comments. Signing off A mirzapur viewer ",

            "answer_text": "Mirzapur season 2 is alive, but only because of the hype.  This season, you will learn how to abuse someone verbally and physically even when it is completely unnecessary and sometimes even idiotic.  This series is also inspired from the Harry Potter world, same as bollywood. Consider the scene with Sharad magically picking up the dead weight of Kaleen bhaiya, hopping out of the hill, putting Kaleen bhaiya into the car and leaving the spot with a decent speed (light speed may be). Consider the scene with Munna bhaiya surviving 5 Ak-47 bullets and rest of the minor characters during whole 10 episode series dying in a single bullet. This season by its mood required not a single nude scene but since you got the full authority, do it. Web series directors actually act childish, ask your child not to do something and when he is out of your sight he will do the exact same thing that you asked him not to.  Women in Mirzapur are nothing but the personification of the dialogue ' hindi filam ke hero hain hm, hume koi nahi mar skta, hum amar hain, hum yogya hain '. The only good point of the series is the outstanding performance of the actors. Which is now rare in Bollywood. Honestly, the series only required one and half season for all what the director wanted to convey. Now, even a single episode of the series will be abusive for the real Mirzapur fans. Season 2 is just to satisfy everyone, for example every young guy wanted to watch guddu bhaiya taking revenge and finally succeeding and it happened, every teen-ager wanted to have some nudity of any kind and it happened, girls wanted to see some women empowerment and it happened, everyone wanted munna dead and it happened, nobody wanted kallen bhaiya dead and he survived. So, the whole season is just to satisfy everyone. Final verdict: You have already watched it. Just don't wait for the 3rd season, ' pdhayi likhayi kro IAS, YAS bno '. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer - Hell no. Reason - They brought in the typical Bollywood drama nonsense. No logic. Did not do their homework. Stretching scenes unnecessarily. Long Answer - ( what I could think of ) Ali(Guddu) is recovering from the bullet wounds whereas Divyenndu(Munna) has recovered 100% even after getting shot five times in the back. One will argue \u201cTripathi\u201d can afford the best of medical care. I got a deep cut on my hand with the pointy edge of a meat knife and i could not stretch my palm for 2 months even though it was healed in 3weeks. This is common sense. Shweta(Golu) is clearly scared of loud bang and muzzle flash but instantly learns to control her senses when Ali guides her while shooting. Character building was a bit fast in the first season but it was acceptable. In season 2 the character has multiple personality. Pankaj cannot last long in bed hence goes for consultation. The worst 15 minutes in the series. Yes you can add a little comedy but it felt like Rohit Shetty was directing it. The reason I have only these many points is because I could not watch after episode 2. If you are okay with the above then you can go ahead and watch. Each and every person in the series is a very good and very capable actor\\actress. Its the acting that is carrying Mirzapur forward. The story is very shabby. And they killed \u201cLalith\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "REVIEW: Guns, goons and lots of gaalis - welcome to \u2018Mirzapur\u2019, once again. Everyone\u2019s packing heat, human life has no value and abject lawlessness is the accepted world order. Nothing has changed here. Except the rising body count that has intensified the battle lines in this bloody badland. And as always, Munna (Divyendu Sharma) is at the center of all the killings that have become an all familiar calling card for \u2018Mirzapur\u2019. Of course, a lot of these killings are as shocking as they are needless, making us wonder if they could have been avoided altogether. But what\u2019s a UP hinterland if not high on political vendettas and pistols firing up a storm at every given opportunity or the lack of it. Season 2 of \u2018Mirzapur\u2019 picks up from where the first one ended. It kickstarts with even more violence that instantly grabs your attention. Creator Puneet Krishna and his Directors Gurmmeet Singh & Mihir Desai continue to take bold decisions, adding more shock value to this already grim revenge saga. And if you have seen season one and enjoyed its dark narrative then the new season certainly ups the ante. It does so with a more seasoned handling that injects adrenaline in spurts but the overall execution is a slow burn. Since there is a certain relatability with the characters, it\u2019s easier to empathise with their pain, this time around. The plot has simmered to a point where the revenge is inevitable and this time it\u2019s a battle of equals. The bustling bylanes of UP\u2019s politically charged towns once again add their rustic flavour and realism that make for voyeuristic pleasures. They are effectively brought to life DOP by Sanjay Kapoor. The dialogues as usual laced with expletives are mouthed mostly by men, who seem to know no other way to communicate. Pankaj Tripathi continues to lead the show with his stoic expressions, but the actor so subtly lets out witty one-liners at times that it squarely underlines the conflict within. A lesser actor would look repetitive, but Pankaj has an innate quality of owning his character with a natural charm, like no other. Ali Fazal in his beefed-up avatar is suitably cast as Guddu, but doesn\u2019t do a lot more than what we haven\u2019t seen him do before. With a more subdued tone, Guddu\u2019s track also tends to drag at times.Divyendu Sharma clearly seems to have the most fun playing the trigger-happy Munna \u2013 a spoilt brat and a loose cannon responsible for most of the ruckus in \u2018Mirzapur\u2019. At times, the excesses of his character seem quite unreal. The show\u2019s stellar cast is well-lit with strong performers like Dibyendu Bhattacharya, Anjum Sharma, Rajesh Tailang and veteran Kulbhushan Kharbanda, who plays the creepy Bauji with subtlety. Kharbanda is excellent as the family\u2019s patriarch, who talks less but speaks more with his mere presence. This season gives its women more scope. Some are seething with anger while others are toeing the line. Rasika Dugal stands out with her restrained act as a woman, who is forever in the crosshairs of her household\u2019s toxic male fiefdom. Sheeba Chaddha, Harshita Gaur and Shweta Tripathi successfully manage to bring out the inner strength and vulnerability of their characters. The show\u2019s overall casting by \u2018Casting Bay\u2019 is appropriate. \u2018Mirzapur\u2019 2\u2019 has that \u2018killer\u2019 combination of power and politics that largely works, but is not bulletproof to flaws. There are multiple subplots, umpteenth characters (some unwanted) each having their own issues but not necessarily a deeper subtext. While we have seen such revenge dramas in the same UP hinterland many times before (on big and small screen), \u2018Mirzapur\u2019 2\u2019 is a welcome addition. It fires in the right direction and hits the target in delivering a gritty and gruesome tale of intense rivalries. If you find this answer helpful to you, kindly upvote it and follow me here.

I am not revealing any story content for those who are yet to watch season 2. Guddu pandit has changed so much from season 1 and showed some great character transformation and gangstership . The character I felt most is Sharad Shukla. He is one great character i feel. Sharad is a very different and smarter character with lots of plans . Im very impressed with his character . He is very different from Ratishankar shukla. Then I saw many women characters. I feel season 2 gave great importance to many women characters. Beena character was outstanding performance in season 2 and Isha Talwar did good performance. Munna is one of the best performance in season 2 and Khaleen Bhaiyaa there is no need to describe Pankaj Tripathi. Khaleen Bhaiya is outstanding performance. The Ending was perfect One thing I'm sure is Season 3 will come and that's what I have to wait for now. ",

            "answer_text": "Mirzapur is like a clickbait ad/picture or video. They do it via the following: Unnecessary abusive language- There are umpteen instances where abuse and cuss words aren't needed. The attempt at looking cool by indulging in the same is cringeworthyImitating gangs of wasseypur- Mirzapur is at best a rip off, trying the same eastern up dialect and creating a nexus of drug lords, politicians and business. No freshness at allMediocre script- Barring a couple of plots, Mirzapur doesn't have anything to behold your attention. Sketchy screenplay, loose scripts, excessive characters with hardly any substance spoiled the season 2. Season 1 was more focussed from script perspectiveUnnecessary sexual references- Crime based dramas like Godfather, Gangs of New York, Scarface rely a lot on how sex is integral to the story. This series has sex and sexual dialogue interspersed liberally wherever the director felt indulgent. It isn't what excites a viewer. You can watch porn insteadI would rate it a below par 2/5. Just for Pankaj Tripathi and Ali Fazal's screen presence and decent cinematography showing the hinterland. ",

Munna and Guddu will fight it out for the throne of Mirzapur. Mirzapur 2 has started streaming on Amazon Prime Video. While actors like Pankaj Tripathi, Divyenndu Sharmaa, Ali Fazal, Shweta Tripathi, Rasika Dugal and Harshita Gaur will reprise their roles, Vijay Varma, Priyanshu Painyuli, Isha Talwar are the new members of the cast this season. Created by Karan Anshuman and Puneet Krishna, Mirzapur has been bankrolled by Ritesh Sidhwani and Farhan Akhtar. The web series revolves around the corruption, crime, governance failure, rule of mafia dons and gang wars in the titular eastern UP town. It\u2019s new season takes the story forward as the fight to become the king of Mirzapur continues between Guddu Pandit and Munna Bhaiya. In the trailer, we saw crime lord Kaleen Bhaiya defining the rules for the people of Mirzapur, while his wayward son Munna adding his own take. Meanwhile, Guddu Pandit has just one thing in mind \u2013 to avenge the death of his brother (Vikrant Massey) and his wife (Shriya Pilgaonkar). Joining him is Sweety\u2019s sister Golu. Apart from revenge, the two are determined to rule Mirzapur as well. Joining the race to sit on the throne of Mirzapur is Kaleen Bhaiya\u2019s nemesis Rati Shankar Pandey\u2019s son Sharad Shukla, Dadda Tyagi and his grandson. Now, who will manage to win the battle, is what forms the core of the plot. The second season looks a lot more intense, action-packed and bloody. Mirzapur season one received mixed reviews, however, the audience lapped it up. It remains to be seen how the fans will react to the new season. For now, they seem sufficiently intrigued and excited, thanks to some excellent marketing by Amazon Prime Video. ",

            "answer_text": "Picking up where season one left off, with an injured Guddu Pandit (Ali Fazal), a heartbroken Golu (Shweta Tripathi Sharma) and a shattered Dimpy (Harshita Gaur) hiding out from the Munna Tripathi (Divyenndu). Munna\u2019s brutal attack on a wedding killed Guddu\u2019s brother Bablu (Vikrant Massey) and Golu\u2019s sister Sweety (Shriya Pilgaonkar), who was pregnant with Guddu\u2019s child at the time.  Like the first season, the 10-episode second season is drenched in enmity and revenge, ambition and greed, lust and crime. In this lawless region, guns rules and the body count keeps piling up. The language is as colourful as Akhandanand Tripathi/Kaleen Bhai\u2019s (Pankaj Tripathi) carpet designs, a front for all his illegal businesses. Surviving five bullet wounds, Munna believes he is invincible. But he has unfinished business and it takes all of Kaleen Bhai\u2019s smarts to keep his son in check. Munna wants Guddu dead and the throne of Mirzapur. Kaleen Bhai does not think his son is ready for the responsibility. Munna\u2019s grandfather (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) does not think his grandson is ready. Kaleen Bhaiya\u2019s wife, Beena (Rasika Dugal), has her own problems with the Tripathi men. Fuelled by her desire for vengeance, she uses all her guile to safeguard her future. Guddu and Golu are emotionally distraught, but their end game is clear \u2013 an eye for an eye. But first, Guddu must heal mentally, emotionally and physically. Golu has to find the grit to fight the unfair fight and recalibrate to emotional core. Fortunately Dimpy gets normalcy restored to her life, though the introduction of a colourful and glib fixer called Robin is a distraction, not least because of the thick-framed spectacles and printed shirts. Priyanshu Painyuli plays the street-smart money manager (whose office quite reminded me of Saul Goodman\u2019s den in Breaking Bad). Robin is one of a handful of new characters introduced in season two. Vijay Varma plays \u2018Chhote\u2019 Tyagi and Lilliput plays his father, Dadda Tyagi, a car-jacker and liquor smuggler who become potential new partners as the Tripathis and Guddu/Golu look to expand their guns and drugs business. The Chief Minister\u2019s daughter Madhuri (Isha Talwar) is another new player. At first Anjum Sharma\u2019s Sharad Shukla, also thirsting for retribution after his father Rati Shankar was killed by Guddu, suggests that he would be the catalyst for some clever manoeuvrings. Though he largely pauses for thought before pulling the trigger, Sharad also turns into a flip-flopping associate. There are cops lurking around too, like Amit Sial\u2019s Maurya, appearing empowered but emerging incompetent.  As Guddu and Golu turn into Bonnie and Clyde, can there be any winner in this bloody pursuit for the throne of Mirzapur where machismo trumps strategy? Writers Puneet Krishna and Vineet Krishna pack the season with plenty of drama and come out guns blazing. The season, directed by Gurmmeet Singh and Mihir Desai, peaks mid-way. The latter episodes are dilated with side plots such as the status of widows, power play in politics and expectations for loyalty from employees. Within all of this one sometimes loses sight of the main thread \u2013 enmity between Guddu and Munna. Shweta Tripathi and Ali Fazal bring out the emotional angst and deep pain of their hopeless situation. In a leap from the first season, Fazal brings a reflective layer to Guddu. Pankaj Tripathi makes every scene count as he subtly portrays Kaleen Bhai\u2019s disappointments, victories and the ability to turn a blind eye to the mess in his own home. Rasika Dugal\u2019s Beena crackles and continues to be one of the more fascinating characters. As the explosive Munna, Divyenndu is all kinds of evil, and chaos and, completely entertaining. Season 2 ends with what we have come to expect when a game of thrones is afoot \u2013 some will die, some will live, and the show will go on.

            "answer_text": "WASTED 10 HOURS Indian Web series has the history of putting disastrous second seasons after success of First one. Same was for Sacred Games, same is it for this. I think the story didn\u2019t developed much after Season 1. The story was a bit predictable. Guddu and Munna were both alive. I had expected a bit of more rivalry between the two but second season was all about business and more business. There was only 2 occasions in which both the arch rivals came face to face.  Guddu bhaiya was less scary. Partly because he committed only few violent crimes but it looked like this season downplayed his character arc. Munna bhaiya, was as usual, a rich, arrogant, brainless idiot. But his punch lines were good. Kalin bhaiya, TERRYFYING, He is cold but ruthless plan maker. And Pankaj Tripathi is so good in the character. Golu, a bit mature and actual business head of Guddu and gang. She is know fearless, ready to fire guns. She is not afraid of seeing blood, and is super cool in desperate situations. The best character, I think, introduced in new season Robin, and his colorful shirts.  Other characters, were to say, IMPACTFUL, to say the least. Nothing wrong with portrayal but in story. And last the character, which I thought was the most important, cunning, schemer and a sure WINNER.  Disappointed with the story and some characters. Most of the characters were of little importance. So much focus on the business. Kaalin bhaiya was now more of a politician rather than a Baahubali. The script could have been much bolder. Random cussing words are not indicative of good dialogues. Rather it shows the inability of putting god dialogues and author had to substitute it with Gaalis to cover up the flaw. No Spoilers!!! But KAALIN BHAIYYA WILL BE BACK TO TAKE REVENGE. And for that I will be waiting for Season 3. ",

Mirzapur is long-form of Gangs of Wasseypur Tripathi\u2019s scheming wife, Beena (a terrific Rasika Dugal), is arguably this season\u2019s most resounding characterOn being reduced to a sex toy by her depraved father-in-law (Kulbhushan Kharbanda), she starts to weaponize the misogyny of the household by exploiting their egos.  Perhaps that\u2019s where the performances come in. a loose canon like Munna Tripathi \u2013 again excellently performed by Divyendu Sharma \u2013 is that his sheer unpredictability frees him from the shackles of continuity. It doesn\u2019t matter where he was in the previous scene an episode ago, because his rage and resentment allows Munna to revel in lateral movement. Pankaj Tripathi, as Kaleen Bhaiya, is a legend, enough said. ",

I didn't liked Golu and Guddu, couldn't connect with them. Golu was too robotic and emotionless, while Guddu seems lost. Too many subplots without cohesion were introduced.  The track I liked the most was of Munna and Madhuri, the transition of Munna to a caring and proud husband who stands by his wife is a delight to watch. The gradual strengthening of their relationship is beautiful. Women of Mirzapur, their characters had depth expect Golu and Dimpy. Beena, the tigress her quest to survive and rule is something to watch out for. Madhuri, clear sighted, calm and mature lady who tries to understand her husband and be with him. She plays a masterstroke. Zarina, all she wants is respect and will to go any length to seize the same. Too many unwanted characters were introduced like Bharat Tripathi's wife, the doctor and his family's track, Rati Shankar's wife, Shekhu Naayi etc. It offers nothing extraordinary for you to waste 10.5 hours of your life. Easily avoidable don't go by the hype around it! ",

The first season of the Amazon Prime web show had ended on a tense note with the power-hungry goon Munna Bhaiya (played by Divyendu Sharma) killing Guddu's wife Sweety and his brother Bablu, forcing Guddu to go underground. In Mirzapur 2, Guddu has resurfaced and revenge is the only thing on his mind. On his mission, Guddu's partner-in-crime (quite literally) is Golu Gupta (played by Shweta Tripathi), who was in love with Bablu. Together, they plan to avenge their loved ones' death and take down Munna Bhaiya and his father Kaleen Bhaiya, the prime antagonist of the show, played by Pankaj Tripathi, who rules the city of Uttar Pradesh's Mirzapur. Actor Rasika Dugal and Kulbhushan Kharbanda reprise their roles in Mirzapur 2 and make blink-and-miss appearances in the trailer. New characters also join the second season, played by actors such as Vijay Varma, Anjum Sharma, Isha Talwar and Amit Sial. The new additions lead to more plot twists and turns, intensifying the drama and the suspense. ",

Spoilers here on. despite Kaleem bhaiyya reaching political heights. He is not able to finish of Guddu. Now that Guddu bhaiyya has taken the throne. Munna \u2018s wife is CM.. it will take her a min to destroy him as he doesn\u2019t have political backing. Tyagi family was introduced but there was no need for double role.Too much importance to ego for evry actor. But overall it\u2019s a good watch. It keeps u hooked till last minute. GO FOR IT ",

            "answer_text": "The season 2 was good but not as good as the first season. There are some plot holes. Getting into the characters:- Guddu:- Ali Fazal did a really good job playing guddu and we could feel the rage inside him in the second season. Munna:- Divyendu Sharma really got into the skin of the character and it was a really brilliant job by him. Kaleen bhaiya:- kaleen bhaiya or Akhandanand Tripathi played by Pankaj Tripathi, like the other cast members he too did a brilliant job. What's fascinating about his character is that we notice his presence even though he doesn't have much dialogues compared to the others. Beena Tripathi:- If you have watched it, you cannot deny the fact that Rasiga Dugal played Beena Tripathi so well. Kudos to her Sharad Shukla:- This is an underrated character. Anjum Sharma also did a really good job in his playing sharadt. And there are some other characters \ud83d\ude2c it would be too damn long if I mentioned them all Season 2 is based on Guddu's revenge on the Tripathi's as they killed his brother (RIP Bablu bhaiya) Plot holes/mistakes:- 1: Why didn't the guards react when Maqbool walk into the Tripathi mansion with a freaking Gun. Were the guards deaf, c'mon he shot too many bullets, didn't they hear anything. 2: Ok this isn't a plot hole,the scene were the Tyagi's turned on each other, chote (the younger twin) gets killed. But in the post credit scene, it's revealed that Bade(the elder twin) was killed. Isn't this something common in Indian cinema, the wrong person was killed blah blah. Hope this was helpful and this is my first review \ud83d\ude2c. ",
