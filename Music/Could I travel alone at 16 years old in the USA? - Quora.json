            "answer_text": "Thanks for the ATA. Yes you can, but to get a green card you are probably going to need to be a so called \u201calien of extraordinary ability\u201d with significant public acclaim in some field. To achieve that level of acclaim at such a young age it will often be in fields like sports or performing arts. Examples of well known immigrants who came to the US under age 18 are Monica Seles and Justin Bieber. If you aren\u2019t coming with that level of \u201cextraordinary ability\u201d it is going to be really tough to qualify for a green card before age 18, since getting the education, work experience, and going through the process takes years\u2014even if you are from a country where there aren\u2019t long backlogs. It will be very hard to get all that done before 18. It is more plausible, for most people, to come to the US before age 18 on a student visa, but that will require money to do. In any case it will be much easier to do if done with the blessings of your parents, even if they don\u2019t accompany you, because someone under 18 can\u2019t sign enforceable contracts in the USA, so you will need some kind of adult support.

            "answer_text": "Yes, minors are allowed to travel to the US by themselves. Here are the two options: Your parent(s)/guardian(s) may arrange unaccompanied minor (UM) service with an airline. However, there must be somebody dropping you off and picking you up at the airport.With a legal formal letter of permission from your parents, you can travel to the US without using the UM service. Just make sure you bring it and show it at the Border Control. Although not necessary, it is best that somebody picks you up to reassure the Border Control agent that you will not be completely on your own!NB: It also depends on where you are starting your journey from. Certain countries, like South Africa, require its underage citizens (or any underage passengers) and their parents/guardians to submit certain documents (e.g. a copy of your birth certificate) prior to boarding the flight.

I won\u2019t recover what the others said, because they are correct. MY only advice it that you make sure you are comfortable with their maturity level, because they will be responsible for making it to the gate and boarding themselves, and because alcohol is served free on overseas flights. Your child would be listed as an unaccompanied minor on the flight manifest, but I can assure you that the cabin crew is not checking that seat by seat when taking drink orders. Arriving at the U.S. Customs counter intoxicated is not the best way for a 17 year old to enter the U.S. They could hold them until a parent or legal guardian arrives to pick them up.

It costs many thousands of pounds to emigrate anywhere and takes a long time. Most people have to save for years to get the immigration fees to emigrate and then another x thousands to live off for one year while you find work so that\u2019s your first problem to overcome, almost all under 18\u2019s don\u2019t have disposable income of many thousands and you\u2019d have to have/get the total amount in one go untouched in a separate bank account at the point of being ready to begin the process. Immigration is a legal process it\u2019s a contract between an individual and a Government, you must be over 18 to legally enter into and sign contracts and legal documents, they\u2019re not legally enforceable otherwise and are null and void. You have to be over 18 for a visa which is a legal document and you\u2019d need an immigrant visa. ",

Visiting the US under the age of 18 would not be smart in some states. In Nevada or New York for example, someone under the age of 21 cannot check out a hotel room in many cases.  In Washington state you can rent a hotel room at the age 18, but not under the age of 18 still.  I think you would need to have relatives in the US for a realistic way to be housed anywhere. It is impossible to check out hotel rooms under the age of 18 even if you demonstrate the ability to pay.  ",

Rather, there is an attempt to assess the real intent and reason for the foreigner appearing in front of them. The irregularity of a minor arriving with no adult and meeting no adult as local guardian would be reason to interpret the story of one's plans as questionable. If entry is refused, the airline has to fly the minor back to the origin of the trip.  For that reason, the airline would need satisfactory supporting information about guardianship while in the US, and possibly correspondence through the US embassy authorizing the trip in advance. ",

The problem is if you plan on coming here, there are requirements such as a tourist visa (some countries have waivers of this requirement). If you plan on staying it\u2019s a much longer and harder process. Also, if you come alone at 17 you\u2019re gonna have a hard time. You can\u2019t get an apartment or rent a hotel room, where would you stay? There\u2019s a lot of logistical issues that arise from your age.

Depending on where you are traveling, and the temperatures there, you could pack a tent in you car and stay at camp sites. You could also sleep in your car. I did both of those things when I was young, simply because it was cheaper than getting a hotel room. Good luck and safe travels. ",
