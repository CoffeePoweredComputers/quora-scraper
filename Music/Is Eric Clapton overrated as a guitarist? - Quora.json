            "answer_text": "Yes, he\u2019s overrated and has been for some time now. The biggest problem with Clapton is that he really is not that innovative of a guitar player. The only people who think he is god, are people who have never sat down and listened to the Blues masters where he gets all his riffs and style from. The one guitar player Clapton takes from the absolute most is Freddie King. Go through some of King\u2019s songs, particularly his instrumental work in the late 1950\u2019s. Clapton at least admits this. He can emulate Freddie King to such an extent that you would think you were listening to Freddie himself. Outside of Freddie, he also takes from Albert King too. The guitar solo at the end of Cream\u2019s \u2018Strange Brew\u2019 is a note for note copy of Albert King\u2019s solo in \u2018Crosscut Saw\u2019. (Clapton is not the only one to copy these solos. Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin outright plagiarized solos and riffs taken from Blues greats. He and Robert Plant were in a lot of copyright controversy for putting their names on those songs). There are many other Blues players Clapton gets his riffs and style from, but I\u2019ll leave it here. The biggest one is Freddie King. Clapton\u2019s big claim to fame was doing his infamous album with John Mayall\u2019s Bluesbreakers. It\u2019s a great album and quite possibly the best Clapton sounded. He went on to join Cream and in 1967 he was the best guitar player in the world until a guy called Hendrix showed him up on stage one night and stole the torch. Cream was a good rock band at the time, though they had something of a pop sound to them. At times, they were ridiculously heavy and it\u2019s fair to say they helped craft early heavy metal. Clapton sounded brilliant with Cream. John Mayall\u2019s band had a variety of different Blues guitar players. After Clapton left, there came Peter Green, whom was famously quoted as being better than Clapton. Mick Taylor who would join the Rolling Stones during their peak prime, was also a John Mayall find. Clapton, Green and Taylor are widely considered the best guitar players to come out of Mayall\u2019s band. After Cream, Clapton really only made one noteworthy solo album, and that is Derek and the Domino\u2019s album \u2018Layla\u2019. It\u2019s worth mentioning that Clapton had tremendous help making this album from Allman Brothers great Duane Allman whom played lead guitar and co-wrote a lot of the songs. That\u2019s not Clapton you hear doing the lead guitar on the infamous title track of Layla, that is actually Allman who also does the slide solo. The best songs on that album by no coincidence had Allman playing leads. Clapton\u2019s solo career though was a mega success and I think that has become forgotten in time. He may be overrated, but back in the 1970\u2019s his solo career was doing incredibly well. His albums \u2018401 Ocean Boulevard\u2019 and \u2018Slowhand\u2019 were hot sellers and had hits like Cocaine, Mainline Florida and his cover of I Shot The Sheriff. Those solo albums really have not aged well despite how successful they were decades ago. I have copies of Slowhand and 401 and yeah, they are largely forgettable milquetoast soft blues rock albums. 401 was released in 1974. The rivaling rock albums at the time were Led Zeppelin\u2019s Houses of the Holy, Pink Floyd\u2019s Dark Side of the Moon and David Bowie\u2019s Diamond Dogs. Clapton\u2019s album is quite forgettable when compared to these other albums that are all landmarks for those artists. A year after 1974, Jeff Beck released \u2018Blow By Blow\u2019, which is one of the greatest guitar driven albums ever. Clapton never had an album that was like Beck\u2019s Blow By Blow. Before I list other guitar players, I want to talk about Clapton\u2019s tone. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but Clapton is one of the only guitar players I have ever heard who can make a Stratocaster sound bad. Everyone tends to agree that his guitar tones are great when he has a Gibson style guitar in his hands. His tones are absolutely brilliant with the Les Paul or ES-335, but when he plugs in a Strat, he really sounds generic and plain. Even on the \u2018Layla\u2019 album, his tone sounds flat and dull when paired with Duane Allman who is mostly running a Les Paul with a lot of reverb. I don\u2019t know what it is, but Clapton just don\u2019t thrill me with a Strat and make me want to run out and buy one. He don\u2019t have a level of uniqueness to him with his tone like how Stevie Ray Vaughan or Jimi Hendrix did. Other guitar players who don\u2019t get the credit Clapton gets who deserve it - Freddie King - Absolutely worth checking out as this was the Blues master whom Clapton gets most of his style from.Jeff Beck - This is the guy who should\u2019ve got all the credit Clapton gets. A true innovative guitar player who pushed the boundaries of the instrument and inspired a legion of guys who followed in his foot steps. In some ways, Beck was probably the first \u2018shredder\u2019. Steve Vai was heavily influenced by him. Beck could play the blues, heavy rock, and even fiddled with Jazz Fusion and later techno driven dance music (yes, really!). His albums \u2018Blow By Blow\u2019 and \u2018Wired\u2019 have much better guitar stuff than Clapton ever did after the 60\u2019s. Beck just kept getting better and better, experimenting more as time went on.Peter Green - It really means something when back in 1968 someone said this guy was better than Clapton. Peter Green founded the band Fleetwood Mac and during the late 60\u2019s, no one was playing the Blues harder than them except the Jeff Beck Group. Green had a unique tone to himself and his phrasing and style of writing dual guitar instrumentation has led to him having a cult following for years.Duane Allman - We\u2019ll never know what could\u2019ve been with Allman due to his tragic death at such a young age. If you liked the Layla album, it\u2019s worth checking out the Allman Bros and hearing the guy who really made those songs unique.",

            "answer_text": "Eric Clapton is more significant than most folks realize. He is one of those rare musicians who is commonly counted as the best of his particular genre and/or instrument, and yet is deserving of even more acclaim than he regularly receives . . . like Bing Crosby, Aretha Franklin, The Beatles, etc, Clapton is frequently asserted to be the best at what he does \u2013 yet he is so much more significant a musician than people understand. One way you can consider the impact and significance of any specific musical artist is to consider their influence, what music was like before them and what music was like after them. There are only a handful of names in American popular music that you can point to as changing things, as having an impact that made everything after them different than it was before them. Bing Crosby taught everyone the subtleties and phrasing of how to sing into a recording microphone. Benny Goodman gave popular music a legitimacy to sit and listen to, not just to dance to or to play at some particular occasion, and he brought blues-influenced sounds to the forefront of American music. Muddy Waters incorporated authentic Delta Blues into an energized, hopping, electric Chicago Blues that informed the Rock & Roll that was just around the corner. Little Richard took Rhythm & Blues and bumped up the tempo and urgency to create Rock & Roll. Elvis took the Country Music he grew-up with and the Black church music and Blues that he loved and jammed them together and popularized the 3 minute Blues-based record that still dominates the sound of American Popular music. The Beatles, listening to all those early American Rock & Roll records, mixed in string arrangements and show-tune features and witty songwriting with an abandoning of genre rules or expectations to broaden the whole field of American Popular music . . . they were simply so big, if The Beatles did it it's ok to do. All of these artists changed things, music was different after them than it was before them. Eric Clapton must be included in that small list of innovative, significant, music-altering artists. Today, when you see an electric guitar you think of Rock music - when Clapton started, Rock & Roll music might just as likely have a piano or saxophone as the lead sound of the solo break. Eric Clapton so gloriously played guitar that he just about single-handedly established it as THE sound of Rock music. David Crosby, of The Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills, & Nash, once said that The Beatles made every young American boy want to go out and buy a guitar - Eric Clapton made them all want to learn how to play it. George Harrison, the guitarist for The Beatles, said that back in the early days when from night to night local clubs might have The Beatles, The Animals, The Kinks, or The Yardbirds, etc, on stage, Clapton was the only guitar player who didn't shrink back and hide a bit when the guitar solo part came around, that he was the only one who relished a chance to play and would stand boldly offering his interpretation of American Blues and Rock & Roll. He's the only artist to be inducted into The Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame 3 times (as a member of The Yardbirds and then Cream and as a solo performer), he has been awarded an OBE & a CBE (The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire), seventeen Grammy Awards, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, an Emmy & a BAFTA, and was nominated for a Golden Globe, etc, etc. And year after year his \"Layla\" is voted on radio stations around the world as the number 1 greatest Rock song ever recorded. And in 1990, Eric Clapton sold-out London's The Royal Albert Hall for 24 consecutive nights. On the final night of this remarkable record Clapton was presented with the original key to Second Tier Box 77 which had first been presented to the Trustees of the Great Exhibition of 1851 - making the presentation, the hall\u2019s chief executive Patrick Deuchar said: \u201cWe have had many stars at the Albert Hall. Eric is the star.\u201d Clapton demonstrates how he gets the sound that no one has yet heard from a guitar - again this is years before Led Zeppelin and just prior to Hendrix. Jimi Hendrix was playing with bands like Joey Dee and The Starliters & The Isley Brothers when The Animals bass player Chas Chandler told him he would be a big hit in England - Hendrix agreed to go to England, not to become a big hit, but because he wanted to meet Eric Clapton. I've talked with numerous people who advance a scenario or turn of events that simply is historically inaccurate regarding the development of the Rock music genre and Eric Clapton's foundational role. It must be established that Clapton's band, Cream, is the platform on which Rock music is built. Many seem to just indiscriminately jam all the early Rock bands together, and there was indeed a lot going on, but Cream was before them all . . . historically, date-wise, Cream started it all and everything came from them. Consider this; some of the biggest bands of the 60/70s (Hendrix, Santana, Ten Years After, Joe Cocker, etc) first came to be known by many from their appearance at Woodstock and some bands (like Led Zeppelin) didn't appear until after Woodstock - Cream was already disbanded and Clapton had moved on to other work before Woodstock. To understand the impact that Cream had on bands and music that came after them, with each of these bands you can hear in one song or another, just what bit of Cream they borrowed from . . . sounds that we instantly recognize and associate with Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, even The Beatles, you can hear, sometimes years earlier, from Clapton \u2013 and that\u2019s true with The Doors, The Allman Brothers, Deep Purple, Ten Years After, Grand Funk Railroad, Jethro Tull, Foghat, etc, etc. I mean with each of those bands you can listen to one of their songs, that sounds so much like the sound that band was identified with, and then find a single Cream song that each band\u2019s sound was built on. And here\u2019s the deal that so many looking back on it seem to either forget or not understand \u2013 before Cream (which again was already disbanded and Clapton was on to other work by the time of Woodstock) Clapton had already done some of Rock\u2019s most amazing guitar work with The Yardbirds and John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers. It was with Mayall's Bluesbreakers, before Cream, before \"Layla\", before \"After Midnight\" & \"Cocaine\", etc, that \"Clapton is God\" began to appear painted on the walls of London. Clapton recorded only one LP with John Mayall, \"Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton\", but it is a landmark album (often referred to as 'The Beano Album' because the cover shot shows Clapton reading a well known British comic, 'The Beano'). In this album Clapton establishes the guitar as irrevocably the sound of Rock music and sets down the template that every guitar player would, and still do, follow - this is one of the most influential and important LPs of the Rock era and demonstrates a giant leap forward in the developing style of Blues-based rock music . . . no one could have done this, played like this, at that time besides Eric Clapton - and now, everyone plays like it. Clapton taught generations of young guitar players how to play guitar with this LP. There are too many laudable distinctions to list to properly recognize the significance of Cream; they were the first super group, the first to perform extended live versions of their songs, the first album rock band (songs well over the 3 minute radio standard that became hits), they invented the improvisational solo, etc, etc - Cream is the watershed Rock band that started everything and that every other Rock band comes from. \"Super group\" refers to the fact that each of the band members (Ginger Baker, Jack Bruce, and Eric Clapton) were already known and esteemed as members of other bands . . . they were named \"Cream\" because they were widely considered the cream of the crop of the British music scene; Baker was the best drummer, Bruce was the best bass player, and Clapton was the best guitarist. Together, as Cream, they changed the direction of popular music. When the volatile, mercurial Cream had run it's course, Clapton joined with Ginger Baker (Graham Bond Organization & Cream) and Steve Winwood (The Spencer Davis Group & Traffic) to form music's second super group, Blind Faith in 1969. Again, Clapton was breaking new ground, Blind Faith had a sound that would eventually influence bands like Rod Stewart & Ron Wood's Faces, Fleetwood Mac, and others. In 1970 Clapton formed a new band with American Rhythm & Blues, Blues, & Rock players. Wanting to shun the limelight, avoid the newsworthy notice of another super-group, and simply make music, Clapton hid behind the band name Derek & The Dominos. When Clapton invited Duane Allman to join them for the recording sessions, Daune's beautiful slide guitar and Clapton's scorching Blues-drenched guitar and his achingly passionate songwriting, came together to produce one of the most epic classic albums of the Rock era. Song after song on the band's only LP, \"Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs\", demonstrates the musical genius of Clapton the songwriter and singer and reestablishes him forever as the most gifted guitar player of his generation. The power and passion and breathtaking musical beauty of this LP cannot be overstated. More than historic, more than influential, Eric Clapton is just plain really really good. His playing is powerful, scorching, and pretty to listen to. I end with the clip below because, simply, it demonstrates how just plain good a player Clapton is. Andy Fairweather-Low has been playing with Clapton for some years now, and this is a song from Andy's early British invasion era group Amen Corner that they play together on occasion at Clapton shows . . . it demonstrates much of what Clapton has in his arsenal and how he puts things together, the choices he makes, the flat-out skill with the instrument that he has and the inspiration he draws from, so that in the end, nobody plays guitar like Eric Clapton.
