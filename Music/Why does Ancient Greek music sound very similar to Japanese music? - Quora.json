            "answer_text": "Firstly notice that the instruments used and available at that time to both cultures had a lot similarities so the sound they produced would be similar at least as far ar the music instruments go. But the music instruments were the same in other regions too the difference is at the melodies. The melodies you might be talking about may be similar cause they accompanied dances to honour our gods such us the dance that the Olympic fire is lit. Most of the dances to gods have a slower tempo and slower movements. That's where another similarity might be. The biggest factor is the type of the music and what it's used for. So melodies of countries that were a lot in wars would be different than the countries that had peace and were focusing on philosophy lets say. The music at a funeral would be different than in a celebration and that stands worldwide. So our music might be similar because at the time that it was composed both our civilisations at the same stage. For someone to compose music there needs to be a certain level of euphoria, well-being. If around you there's people dying of hunger and thirst I bet you wouldn't sing a song would you? It's all about your needs, what you need to hear, music? What type of music? What are the circumstances? What do you have available? It's all about the mindset of the people at the time being. ",
