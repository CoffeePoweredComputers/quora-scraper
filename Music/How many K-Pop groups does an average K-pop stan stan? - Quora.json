            "answer_text": "How many K-Pop groups does an average K-pop stan stan?  I don't know. What's an \u201caverage K-pop stan?\u201d One group? Ten? And if the stan's name is Stan then they have to buy me a meatball sandwich. Look, if you don't make the rules, I'll have to. Oh look, my friend the Internet is here to help. Allkpop will set the bar for our experiment via their own website poll.  They'll have to represent fans around the globe. 1-5 groups is hugely popular while 6-10 makes a close second. Then 21-25 improbably makes things weird. So, we'll say the \u201caverage\" K-pop fan stans about 6 groups. Several things can throw off my equation. One could argue the possibility that no one who took the poll was \u201caverage.\u201d Or someone could say that my number leans more toward 5 than 6. If you're debating these things, you've just been cooped up in the house for too long. Like me. For instance, I have already fully analyzed the Mandalorian's fighting style and I'm sure I can beat him.  So yeah, 6 groups. How many groups do you stan? Are you \u201caverage?\u201d Am I? Let's look. Twice Blackpink Oh My Girl Apink SNSD Gfriend Pink Fantasy (I'm not average) (G)-idle BTS Big Bang Winner Red Velvet Mamamoo Dreamcatcher Loona Okay, that's enough. How many K-Pop groups does an average K-pop stan stan? Less than me.  Okay bye ",
