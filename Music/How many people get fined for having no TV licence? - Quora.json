It is important to note that almost all of them were under \u00a3200 and many were less than \u00a3250 despite the dire warnings of \u00a31000 fines. Additionally, with very few exceptions, the fines are issued to those who answer their door to TV Licensing \u2018inspectors\u2019, admit to watching without a licence AND sign the paperwork known as a TVL178, or \u2018confession form\u2019 TV Licence \u2018inspectors\u2019 have no powers whatsoever and they cannot enter your home without your consent (they can get a warrant, but this is extremely rare). If you get a visit from TV Licensing staff, you are strongly advised to SAY nothing, SIGN nothing and SHUT your door. This applies whether or not you actually do need a licence, as there have been cases where innocent householders have been taken to court where the documents were falsified. ",
