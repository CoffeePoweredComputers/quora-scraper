I go to Berklee where students are forced to buy MacBooks, which most people use as a glorified FaceBook machine.  MacBooks, work decently for the first year of your ownership, then all sorts of problems arise (absurd battery heat, bad performance, lots of crashing) and parts fall apart. They are extremely fragile computers. Macbooks are good looking and overpriced because they are MacBooks. You could alternatively buy a laptop with the same specs and parts (or even better) for half the price of a MacBook, but you won't look as cool when you're at Starbucks. ",
