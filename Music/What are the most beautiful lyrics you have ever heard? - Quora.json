I never know why it's coming down, down, down Not ready to let go Cause then I'd never know What I could be missing But I'm missing way too much So when do I give up, what I've been wishing for I shot for the sky I'm stuck on the ground So why do I try, I know I'm gonna fall down I thought I could fly, so why did I drown? I never know why it's coming down, down, down Oh I am going down, down, down I can't find another way around And I don't want to hear that sound, of losing what I never found I shot for the sky I'm stuck on the ground So why do I try, I know I'm gonna fall down I thought I could fly, so why did I drown? I'll never know why it's coming down, down, down I shot for the sky I'm stuck on the ground So why do I try, I know I'm gonna fall down I thought I could fly, so why did I drown? Oh, it's coming down, down, down. :) ",

            "answer_text": "1. Imagine - John LennonThis is for sure the most meaningful song on the list. If you imagine the world that we live in like the world John Lennon is telling us to imagine it like, its perfect. The world that we live in is cruel, full of hate, racism, murder, and war. The world that John Lennon sings is tells us how we should want the world to be. In his song there is world peace, and everyone is living together as one people sharing the world. If you listen to the song and imagine the world how he says you would know that I'm right. R.I.P. John Lennon 2. How to Save a Life - The FrayThis song has got me through some dark times over the years especially when I felt low and when no one believed nor cared that I was suffering depression. I would put this song on repeat while I slept and in the morning I would feel happy. The lyrics are so powerful. 3. Skyscraper - Demi LovatoAbsolutely incredible. She's incredible. 4. Man In the Mirror - Michael JacksonIt just gives one of the greatest messages of life, \"change yourself and the world will look a better place\". Energy  combined with love, honesty and good will. After the very beginning, striking with decency, he starts praying in remorse, shouting for justice and ends in intimacy. I love it! 5. Stairway to Heaven - Led ZeppelinIts divine. In all senses.  6. Radioactive - Imagine DragonsThe lyrics to this song have so much depth, just by reading them anyone can see the message that is meant to get across. Its intense!Not only is the message meaningful, but the song... it's different and great! 7. Wings - MacklemoreThis Song is more than beautiful and it shows off how cruel society became. Everybody cares about being popular and rich even though that's totally not important. Great lyrics. 8. We Are the World - Michael JacksonI listen to all types of music and can't remember one song that brought more people together to sing as one voice for one reason the betterment of every man woman & child on earth. 9. Boulevard of Broken Dreams - Green DayAmazing song. Especially when you're watching the lead singer sing this song, you'll actually feel the lyrics get in to your veins. Best Song. Ever! My favorite song of all time! 10. Family Portrait - PinkThis is a very emotional song about families and arguments between parents. I'm sure it will relate to a lot of people. 11. Second and Sebring - of Mice& MenOf Mice and Men is so inspiring! Lyrically I can relate to so many songs.\"I hope you smile when you look down on me\" If that's not meaningful then I don't know what is. 12. Seize the Day - Avenged SevenfoldTheir songs are the best. I promise you that there are not like others, they're unique in their way. The first time I heard this song was a few years ago and I instantly fell in love with even though I don't like the genre. But as I listen to it more, I realised that bands like them write good lyrics. Some of them help people who are in suicidal. 13. Hallelujah - Leonard CohenChillingly beautiful song with a hidden meaning if you listen carefully. I will slowly add more to the list !:) ",
