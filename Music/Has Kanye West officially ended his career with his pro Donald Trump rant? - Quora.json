            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ended his career per se but I do know Black people are pretty angry with his remarks. When Kanye first came on the scene, he presented himself as someone for Black people and who didn\u2019t want to see his people wronged. He spoke proudly of his Chicago roots and community and blackness. He also had a black fianc\u00e9 at the time. His outburst during Katrina about Bush\u2019s response to the hurricane made him gain a lot of respect in the black community by him saying what everyone was too scared to say. However, it seems now that Kanye is gone and replaced with a MAGA hat wearing, Trump supporter who thinks Black people chose to be enslaved for 400 years and is married to a seemingly narcissistic White woman. When Van Lathan told him about how his slavery comments affected the Black community on TMZ and left Kanye speechless that started his downfall among Blacks. Many want nothing to do with West\u2019s music and apparel because he so easily supports a person who is a racist, blatantly doesn\u2019t care about Black people, a misogynist and the list goes on. It\u2019s really sad when you look at how far Kanye has fallen. Sometimes, I wonder if his mental health is contributing to his behaviors. I know he admitted he has bipolar disorder and I wonder if these moments are symptoms of manic behavior or if this is how he truly thinks. I\u2019m not a psychiatrist so I don\u2019t really know but I think it plays a part in everything. Particularly, his random thoughts, outbursts, saying he\u2019s moving back to Chicago for good and leave his wife and kids behind only to then decide he\u2019s going to stay in Cali with his wife and many other random statements and announcements. He\u2019s just very all over the place and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s in the best mental state especially since it can take a while for bipolar disorder to be properly managed when diagnosed. As of right now, his career probably won\u2019t end but he definitely alienated a good portion of his fan base. It would take a lot for POC to support him again and I just don\u2019t see that happening right now. I\u2019m sure White people listen to him but I don\u2019t know to what extent but I do know his clothing and sneakers will keep him relevant and definitely make him money if his music career dies out.

His lack of understanding when it comes to history and politics is embarrassing, but he\u2019s still one of the greatest artists of our generation and a fashion icon. That said, he has alienated millions of fans (in particular many of his black fans). However, he\u2019s also garnered some new ones. I\u2019ve always admired Kanye\u2019s courage to be himself and stand by his opinions and I still do. I just understand he\u2019s ignorant of some of the issues he\u2019s trying to address. But I\u2019m still a fan of his music and always will be. ",
