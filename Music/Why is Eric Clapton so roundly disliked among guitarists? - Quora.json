            "answer_text": "First, there's a lot of good answers below and to an extent I believe everyone of them have great takes on an answer. Ultimately you'll have to read & decide for yourself. However I think it was a combination of a few things. 1) To many Blues purists , he got away from his roots. Those signature long, free flowing \"improvisational\" guitar solos that Blues aficionados love, in exchange for shorter, more commercially structured songs, one after another, which received radio play and helped make him a very rich man. Going solo, Clapton met with more success than he'd ever experienced in Cream 2) The stories about his personality reached the public. Remember, there was no internet in the 60s & 70s during Cream's time so people had to rely solely on magazine & occasional FM interviews to really learn about their favorite Rock personalities (do you remember \"Crawdaddy\"? \"Creem\" magazines? I do!) And they were quite fawning in their coverage of all artists. But returning to E.Cl apart from his guitar playing; I now routinely see internet articles entitled \"25 Rock Stars Who Aren't Very Nice in Person\" (and similar title) and guess who is listed right up there? Yep, Eric Clapton. Apparently he has a very short temper and can be quite nasty to people. Remember, he was a heroin addict and also lost his only child to an accident. His engagement to Sheryl Crow ended and he experienced many life altering events and those surely took a cumulative toll on him. 3. This probably was a minor reason but I'll include it anyway, and it's strictly that the guitar playing public has become more sophisticated. When I started trying to learn guitar in the early 1970s, Lead Guitar was something of a holy grail. There really were (relatively) few instructors or books on the subject, and the little amount of DIY learning material was truly awful. No one had yet put out books in Standard Notation & simultaneous TABlature, and rarely were tiny, cheap, short playing vinyl EPs released which enabled you to listen to the licks you were taught enclosed which you'd have to play on your record turntable. Leaning to play Lead Rock Guitar was still then, truly a mysterious process and if you did go to an instructor, more than likely you were learning from a Mel Bay book (\"Mary Had a Little Lamb\") or from a Jazz Book which can be terribly daunting (believe me, I tried!). Nowadays, colleges and universities routinely teach Guitar. We have places like the Musician's Institute and the prestigious Berklee in Boston where you can MAJOR in Rock guitar. You can learn guitar on the internet for free, and on and on. So TRAINED guitarists began to appear who COULD Read music and actually understood Music Theory. The level of expertise and knowledge simply exploded. And as thousands of young guitarists began learning Rock guitar at younger and younger ages, their sophistication & understanding increased with the result that, what Clapton was doing, was no longer something mysterious or God like. And when you can play exactly the same licks that Clapton played, suddenly he seemed much less God-like, and more like a simply another talented player. And other guitarists who were every bit as talented as Clapton appeared on the scene: Eddie Van Halen, Carlos Santana, Joe Satriani, Yngwie Malmsteen, Stevie Vai, Randy Rhoades and countless others who played guitar every bit as well as Clapton (and sometimes better), Clapton simply was thought of as less of a guitar god, and more as a commercially successful and respected guitarist. I don't think he's truly \"disrespected' or shunned as a player, as much as the sheen and cult over his playing and personality have dimmed over time for ALL the above factors. Newer, equally exciting guitarists and Rock groups come along, fans grow older and more sophisticated, and people re-evaluate their feelings about idols whom they worshiped in their teen years. I think ALL these factors need to be considered. But \"disliked\" is perhaps too strong a word. I think it's more likely that his playing ability was re-evaluated by a now, more sophisticated Rock listening public. Hope this helps. - - D.J. ",

            "answer_text": "I remember when The Who came out with, \u201cI Can See For Miles.\u201d Compared to blues and jazz, it\u2019s an incredibly simple arrangement, and another song that made them a lot of money. One or two of the jazz musicians at the time complained publicly, because they couldn\u2019t compete, money making wise, with rock, and to add insult to injury, the world seemed to believe the rock guitarists were the best guitarists ever produced on the planet, though they knew they were far superior. And after being screwed over by their managers and producers for so many years, I am sure seeing Clapton getting fame and fortune for their basic arrangements undoubtedly made Django Reinhardt scream from the afterlife. Like Stevie Ray Vaughn, Clapton is a virtuoso and genius of the technical kind (picking up a never played instrument and getting very good at it very fast), but in my opinion, the pure soul of the blues was often absent in his songs (compare Kurt Cobain\u2019s unplugged rendition of Leadbelly\u2019s \u201cWhere Did You Sleep Last Night.\u201d). That doesn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t able to pour his heart into some of his songs (e.g. \u201cTears in Heaven\u201d), rather, more often than not, he was just technically incredible (\u201cSunshine of Your Love\u201d). But to achieve God status, another very important ingredient must be present, which is passion (listen to The Joshua Tree) and the ability to perceive holistic patterns\u2014previously unseen relationships\u2014into a cohesive, non-cognitive whole, or Gestalt (the whole is more than the sum of the parts). I am not sure he roundly disliked; perhaps what people have a problem with is his general inclusion with the musicians who truly deserve the title, which creates a false impression in the form of a \u201cshould.\u201d E.g. I feel like I\u2019m supposed to worship him even though he doesn\u2019t deserve it. Personally, he\u2019s just never moved me, man. And his awful, awful work in the 80\u2019s, like Dylan, cannot be overlooked. ",
