            "answer_text": "Eddie Van Halen told a funny story about it. Apparently he didn\u2019t think anyone would know it was him and he did it as a favor to Quincy Jones. \"I said to myself, 'Who is going to know that I played on this kid's record, right? Nobody's going to find out.' Wrong!\" he laughs. \"Big-time wrong. It ended up being Record of the Year.\" Eddie Van Halen deconstructs his collaboration on 'Beat It' It\u2019s amazing to me that Quincy Jones essentially told him to play whatever you want and gave no direction. As far as contributing more than the solo, it sounds like he had the did a lot to the recording. \u201cI listened to the song, and I immediately go, \"Can I change some parts?\" I turned to the engineer and I go, \"OK, from the breakdown, chop in this part, go to this piece, pre-chorus, to the chorus, out.\" Took him maybe 10 minutes to put it together. And I proceeded to improvise two solos over it. I was just finishing the second solo when Michael walked in. And you know artists are kind of crazy people. We're all a little bit strange. I didn't know how he would react to what I was doing. So I warned him before he listened. I said, \"Look, I changed the middle section of your song.\" ",
