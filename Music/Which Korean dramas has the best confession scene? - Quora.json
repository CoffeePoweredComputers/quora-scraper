            "answer_text": " Beauty Inside The lead couple each have a physical disorder that must be kept secret. She is sweet and caring and ready to help anyone in need and relies on the help of friends while he has built a cold wall of distrust around himself, isolating him from friends, family and happiness.-Also loved the secondary couple. She is cliche cold hearted bad girl and he is a sweet irresistibly cute boy who would give up his dream to become a Priest for a girl like that. Adapted from a Korean movie which was adapted from a web series produced jointly by Toshiba,Intel, and Facebook.  A Korean Odyssey- Rude male beginnings are a cliche in k-drama but this is the only one that I have seen where our male lead begins by cheating her when she is an innocent child and then trying to eat her (with a delicious sauce) when she becomes an adult. With a start like that how could she not fall in love? The characters and many props are based on a classic Chinese book that is over 500 years old (1600 pages) named The Journey West and the portrayal of the Monkey King, Great Sage Equal to Heaven is absolutely perfect! Viewers were disappointed with a cliffhanger ending but you will understand why it had to be that way and enjoy it more if you check out my comments about the book by searching the question \u201cDoes anyone in here like the drama A Korean Odyssey?\u201d.   I\u2019m Sorry, I Love You (the original Korean version with So Ji-sub)- Adopted man with three months to live seeks out his lost family and sets out to exact revenge on the mother who abandoned him and the son she replaced him with The two men fall in love with a woman that becomes a part of an intensely passionate love triangle. Warning this one is really exceptionally good but also really exceptionally sad. She actually repeats the words \u201cI love you\u201d twenty-three times in the scene shown on top but he never responds to her until he calls to say his last words which were later carved on his headstone, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I love you\u201d.

            "answer_text": "Hmmm\u2026hard to say, since I am not really into romances; however, I would consider Lee Joon Gi\u2019s confession in \u201cScholar Who Walks the Night\u201d as the best, since he did it in a very subtle manner before he actually said it. It was when he was walking with the girl and she was asking him why he kept her by his side. She tried to figure out three reasons, with him shaking his head to the first two. The third, she could not say, since she was hoping it could be that, but she could not ask him. He knew, and had to handle a very innocent girl\u2019s question by not saying it directly, but implying it with, \u201cwhatever the third one is, that\u2019s the reason.\u201d It was only when he was about to go into the final battle with Gwi (Lee Soo Hyuk) that he really said it. Another would be the way he did it in \u201cFlower of Evil.\u201d Now that was a very difficult one to show, since he played a man who could not feel emotion. Even if he actually loved his wife, he could not realize it until he was about to lose her. And even then he could not figure it out until she helped him realize that what he felt was love. I would advise you to watch the drama and see for yourself. Do Hyun Soo was a very interesting character. ",
