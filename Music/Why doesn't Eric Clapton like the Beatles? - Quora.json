            "answer_text": "The Beatles are gone. They ended in 1970. So how he feels about them has likely changed and isn\u2019t relevant. Why didn\u2019t Clapton like the Beatles in the early 1960s? Because in the early 60s they were the most over hyped band in the world. While they were unquestionably a very talented band, there\u2019s no way they could possibly live up to the hype and how they were being marketed at the time. I doubt Clapton was the only person in the music business who despised this and them, the way they were being portrayed as if they floated six inches off the ground when they walked. I doubt anyone in the music business who wasn\u2019t making a lot of money off the Beatles liked the Beatles. Would he have joined the band or not in 1969? There are good reason for either decision. Cons: The Beatles had stopped touring a few years before and any gig with them was likely going to be recording only. Touring is where the bulk of the money for recording artists is in the music business. He likely would have been an salaried employee not a member of the band. The Beatles were on a downwards trajectory. Lennon clearly wanted out and wanted a solo career. Clapton joining would not have changed that. So he likely would have gotten only one or two albums out of the deal. It was not going to be a long term relationship. Pros: It would have increased his stature in the music business. He would have been paid a lot of money. Rumor has it it\u2019s easily convertible to cocaine. His friendship with Harrison is irrelevant. People have screwed their friends over for a lot less money and for a lot less fame. Disclosure: I\u2019m not a big Beatles fan. I find their music way too pop oriented. Unlike the Rolling Stones who were also blues fans, the Beatles were never able to capture the spirit of the blues in their own compositions, like the Rolling Stones can do. I\u2019m also not a huge fan of Clapton. I think when he\u2019s covering Robert Johnson, he\u2019s incredible but that\u2019s mostly Johnson\u2019s material. But his other stuff, especially his solo material, doesn\u2019t do much for me. For a blues aficionado, he isn\u2019t able to capture it\u2019s spirit in his own compositions. ",

            "answer_text": " I don\u2019t think Clapton ever really \u201cdisliked\u201d the Beatles Clapton said in an interview he used to listen to the Beatles on a radio channel which played Beatles music every week, with the actual quote from the interview below: Clapton - \u201cThey had a radio show called \u201cPop Go The Beatles\u201d once a week\u201d Reporter - \u201cAnd you listened to them?\u201d Clapton - \u201cYeah\u201d So using this evidence, I don\u2019t really think Clapton disliked The Beatles as of such. After all, he was very close friends with lead guitarist of the Beatles George Harrison and collaborated in \u201cWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps\u201d But the next part of the interview takes an interesting turn, as the reporter asked Clapton whether he aspired to be like the Beatles, Clapton responded with this: \u201cNo. Not at all.\u201d You may ask why he chose to say that? Well, it has everything to do with his musical orientation, as he explains in the next part of the interview: \u201cEven from my earliest recollection of that, that was too poppy.\u201d \u201cBy the time they came around I was already deeply ensconced in hardcore blues.\u201d \u201cI was becoming a purist, straightfast.\u201d So by the time Clapton heard the music of the Beatles, he was already too engaged in the blues music scene to fully appreciate and like the pop numbers of the Beatles. In my opinion, I think Clapton has nothing against The Beatles, it\u2019s just too much of pop for him.  ",
