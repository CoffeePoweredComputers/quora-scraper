            "answer_text": "You mean legendary titles like \u201cNight of the Lepus,\u201d \u201cThe Killer Shrews,\u201d or \u201cKing of the Zombies?\u201d Oh yes, titles from before the 1990\u2019s(an arbitrary cutoff based on my age) were exclusively superior to the ones today. In fact I\u2019m still on the hunt for \u201cCritters\u201d and \u201cKilldozer\u201d on blue-ray. Even the worst of the horror movies of the Before Times are masterpieces as opposed to trash like \u201cGet Out,\u201d \u201cHappy Death Day,\u201d and \u201cThe Babadook.\u201d Perhaps it\u2019s the inability for these millennials to understand just what\u2019s actually scary. Or maybe new moviemakers are too quick to blat you in the head with jump scares to bother pacing their work properly like the great Ed Wood or the team behind \u201cManos: Hands of Fate.\u201d Perhaps it\u2019s color film making it impossible to pass chocolate syrup as blood. Could it be the shift to digital photography and effects that has ruined the sense of immersion of the audience as opposed to the masterful practical work done in \u201cFrom Hell it Came?\u201d Apologies for the sarcasm up to this point, but I get annoyed by both sides of this argument. On the one hand, many of my favorite films are of the older schools of filmmaking (\u201cForbidden Planet,\u201d \u201cThe Thing,\u201d etc.) and are better for how the limitation of the medium shapes the final product, but on the other, I absolutely hate people who refuse to watch or play something just because it\u2019s older. A more direct answer than the ones I\u2019ve sarcastically listed above: there are more good old movies than good new movies because there are more old movies period, and even then the good/bad horror movie percentage is probably about the same. It\u2019s just that the forgettable ones tend to end up forgotten, and must be sought after. If you do decide to seek the bad horror out, here\u2019s a couple places to get started: Mystery Science Theater 3000 made bad movies fun by insulting them and asking you to join in. The original has all the oldies, but the reboot is worth a look too.10\u201350 movie collections, the cheaper the better. Usually these will have 10% uninterestingly competent films, and the rest is trash.Hit up your local thrift store: where bad movies go to die. Sometimes you might find an actual gem in there too to keep yourself motivated.Some film journalists and critics run series of articles dedicated to bad movies. A popular one is IHE\u2019s \u201cSearch for the Worst,\u201d but I found that Moviebob\u2019s yearly \u201cSchlocktober\u201d series to be more concise and interesting.Have fun with your bad movies.

            "answer_text": "Because these days its all CG SH** Have you seen the original invisible man? I went nuts for it, and as much as I love Bela Lugosi\u2026. I have to say its beaten (this is hard one side of my brain is trying to be the other side down right now for thinking and trying to say this) Dracula as my Fave Universal Horror. If you haven\u2019t seen it yet, its not just a horror either but the screaming lady cracks me up for some reason. I think there were a few other funny parts too. But the new one coming out, I can already see to skip it. They could have made a better one without making the husband an abusive Bast\u2026..d. Most new horror is usually just remake of previously made. Its like Hollywood writers just can\u2019t come up with a new idea. How about hiring some High School and College students (anyone\u2026 let them send in their ideas.) There\u2019s not much creativity in it. Usually goes with something that can happen in real life (exploitation ?) but I pref Monster movies, slashers and that sort. Not to say that real life isn\u2019t scary but I never had a monster under the bed (and I didn\u2019t have a closet in my room til I was in H.s. and that was the linen closet) so never had a closet monster either. (THough I did see jaws when I was 5 or 6 \u2026well part of it. Didn\u2019t affect me until the first time I went to the beach err Pt. Pleasant in NJ. Ankle deep I ask\u2026 are there sharks in this water!??!! the final destination movies (well the first 2) were great as when you left the theater you had this heightened alertness, which means the movie some how, somewhere made you paranoid. (which was different for a movie.) I remember coming out of the Tom Cruise war of the worlds, and saw some of those red vines, a street lamp or 2 were red (no idea why as they never are) so even though the movie didn\u2019t scare me\u2026. I did get a little creeped out with my own experience. (usually Ii\u2019m the only one that can scare me) The only other movies that might sort of \u2018scare\u2019 me is natural disasters. Now that earthquke movie with the rock in it, I don\u2019t think was supposed to be horror, but It gave me anxiety/panic attack. I live in NY I only remember feeling one Earthquake here and that was when I was little and it was 1983. Not saying that real life isn\u2019t horror but, putting myself in the shoes of those that had to go through stuff like that; I don\u2019t think its right. Just seeing the trailer of the new Invisible man makes me think of a friend that was in an abusive relationship. If they had soome addiction, or sort of attacks because of it, seeing that trailer might make them relapse into drinking, drugs or any number of things. Also after the whole #metoo thing I think women need to start (forget about kicking ass) but kicking their abusers in the balls then smashing them in the head with a hammer. (Hit me once.. Its an accident, hit be twice\u2026 I\u2019m a scorpio, you may not live after that) Also that I\u2019m one that doesn\u2019t want to relive bad times in my life be it something minor or major, so I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t want to be reminded no matter how strong they are. Frankly the UNKNOWN is scarier. The infinity of space and what may be there, the fact that a small percent of the worlds oceans have been explored ( what was the deepest) Maybe pacific rim and was it the abyss or Leviathan \u2026(I get the 2 movies confused\u2026.) might be right, maybe the aliens aren\u2019t in space (or not only) but in the deepest oceans, depths of which we cannot reach (yet) ",
