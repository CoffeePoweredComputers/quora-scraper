            "answer_text": "Thank you for your request, Sophia Starling. This one\u2019s easy. No two musical groups meant more to me as a teenager than these two: Steely Dan The Guess Who And since I have a story about the latter . . . The Guess Who were a favorite of mine and my boyfriend, who became my first husband. We'd known each other since I was a very grown up twelve year old and he was a very charming fourteen year old. Their song These Eyes became one of \u201cour songs\". What means more to two teenagers in love than songs about love? That one was our breakup song. We broke up once during the three years we were together, just after we \u201cwent all the way\" for the first time. I got pregnant; we got married. I was 15, he was 17. All the while The Guess Who were on the 8-track tape player. Undun, No Sugar Tonight/New Mother Nature ... No Time \u2026 American Woman ... Laughing \u2026 Share the Land ... and countless others. All sung by the incomparable Burton Cummings. He was, and still is, one of my favorite vocalists. No one else had a voice like his. The Guess Who provided the soundtrack to my early adolescent and teenage years. Though we ended up divorced, you never forget first love. You don't forget the father of your son and daughter. You don't forget the music. Flash forward to 2012. The Guess Who are headlining Arts, Beats, and Eats, an annual outdoor event in Royal Oak, MI where my daughter and her family live. When she called me up and told me who was playing I was so excited to be able to share this with her, and so was she, knowing what that band had meant to her father and me. Plus, she digs their music too. Her Mama didn't raise no fool. So here we are. Mother and daughter waiting for an experience of a lifetime. Our faces flushed with excitement and funnel cake. And we get to talking to a guy standing next to us. Leanna says \u201cMy mom's so excited to see these guys. She loves Burton Cummings . . .\u201d And the guy gets this incredulous look on his face and says . . \u201cWait. You don't actually think you're gonna see Burton Cummings here tonight, do you\"? . . . . . . My heart sank. My breath left me. We both see the stricken look on each other's faces. Then my wonderful, compassionate daughter takes me into her arms and I begin to cry. \u201cOh, Mom .. I'm so sorry.\u201d I stood there with my head on her shoulder, heartbroken. She murmurs comfort to her mother, as I had done so many times with her. She waits as my tears subside, then gently wiped them away. \u201cOkay, Mom. Let's enjoy the show.\u201d We did. The singer was .. adequate but he was no Burton Cummings. But as I watch Leanna dance to her favorite Guess Who song, No Sugar Tonight/New Mother Nature (Oh, I LOVE this one \u2026)! I know you do, Leanna. I know. Me too \u2026 I join her. A few more tears flowed during These Eyes; my daughter put her arm around me as we swayed, and she gave me a knowing smile. Later she showed me a text conversation she'd had with her husband, my equally wonderful son-in-law Gregory, who was home with my granddaughters. She: Burton Cummings is not here. : ( He: OOh NO! Mama D's not gonna like THAT! She: Yeah, she doesn't. But it'll be OK. He: So, are you beautiful ladies getting hit on? I'd be hitting on you. She: Awww \u2026 I love you. Then, a bunch of announcements for Burton Cummings shows in Canada that Gregory had sent. \u2026 I love you too, Gregory. I was no longer sad. How could I be? I have my memories. I never forgot the music. These eyes have seen a lot of loves but they're never gonna see another one like I had with you . . . ",
