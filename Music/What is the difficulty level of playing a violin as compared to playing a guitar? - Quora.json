            "answer_text": "I learned violin for some time when I was a kid. Comparing it to learning guitar, I\u2019d say that the learning curve is a very different one. Violin has a very frustrating steep curve. For some people, it takes months of practice until it sound decent. This is due to the fact that there are more factors that will make you sound awful. The fretless fingerboard will make it hard to hit the right notes, there\u2019s your basic hand-to-hand coordination, the way you use a bow can be very tricky as well\u2026 Mess any of those thing up and your neighbors will hate your guts. I find the guitar to be a very beginner friendly. It\u2019s easy to start by learning simple chords. You won\u2019t sound too awesome, but it\u2019s hard to mess it up completely. With a fretted instrument, you don\u2019t need the same amount of precision as with a fretless one. Also, handling the guitar pick feels a bit more natural than a bow.  TL;DR For a complete beginner, starting to learn violin will feel much more difficult than guitar. It\u2019ll probably take much longer to perform simple things. Mastering an instrument is an entirely different thing. I claim that a guitar is the most versatile analog instrument. The sheer amount of different styles and techniques that you can learn is much larger than with others. That means that mastering a guitar to a point where you are flawless in, let\u2019s say 80% of common techniques will take longer. Also, there are things that are very genre specific. If you\u2019re learning flamenco or similar styles on acoustic guitar, there\u2019s a lot of percussion technique going on. When learning rock guitar, you have to learn how to deal with unwanted noise on a heavily distorted & amplified guitar.  My grandmother was a violin teacher. When she tried teaching me violin (didn\u2019t enjoy it as a kid), she told me that it\u2019ll take 2 years to play half of the sheet music there is, 5 years to play 90% of it and a lifetime to make it sound decent. Comparing to electric guitar: after practicing rigorously for about 6 years I probably can play 80% of rock & metal music, no jazz whatsoever, no flamenco whatsoever, can\u2019t even begin to tell how much I suck at acoustic guitar\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "I think it depends on what type of guitar you mean. If you play the acoustic guitar it often is just strumming chords, or very basic fingerstyle. That is usually very easy. You can learn an entire song in only 15 minutes, it would even sound good. Of course, it can be difficult, but it usually isn\u2019t. The electrical guitar is different, from my experience, it is harder. You have to use a pick, which is hard at the beginning. You often need to play melodies and not just strummed chords, like on the acoustic guitar. Depending on what style you play, you have to go very high on the fretboard and the chord shapes can be ridiculous sometimes. But it has one big benefit: if you turn on the distortion, you don\u2019t hear technical mistakes, so you often don\u2019t need to worry about technique. I think electrical guitar is easy at the beginning, but can get very hard, but most repertoire is probably easier to play than the violin. Then there is the classical guitar. Classical guitar may be less painful than electric or acoustic, but it is played without pick, there is almost no strumming in classical guitar. Classical guitar is often very fast, has weird rhythms(spanish guitar) and the wide fretboard can be hard to handle sometimes. Aso, the classical guitar is very unknown, so there is not a lot of repertoire. That means, we have to play other repertoire eg. strings, piano, or even orchestral music. You then often have to tune your guitar differently, which makes sheet music difficult to read. And the fingerings are extremely weird sometimes. I think the classical guitar is at least as difficult to master as the violin. The guitar might be easier to start off with than the violin, but I am pretty sure it is much harder to master. ",
