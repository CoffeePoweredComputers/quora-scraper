            "answer_text": "Well\u2026 Eurovision isn't be forced to include Israel. It never has been. Most of Europe is actually fond of Israel. Even Germany - yes, like Bunderepublik von Deutschland - is one of their major allies. If you did not know that. While Israel remains in the Middle East, it is more connected to Europe than it is to the nations neighboring them. While Israel tries to remain peaceful, their neighbors want them gone. Lebanon even prevented Wonder Woman from being aired in theaters because Gal Gadot was Israeli. Moving on to Israel and Europe, again, Israel is more connected to Europe than it is the Middle East. In fact, they even play in the Union of European Football Associations in soccer. They were in the Asian Football Confederation, but, they were expelled. Israel is eligable to enter because they are an active member in the European Brodcasting Union. They can brodcast as far as IRELAND. The Israeli Brodcasting Authority was already a non-European member of the EBU. If I am not mistaken, when Austria and Malta withdrawed from the song contest, Israel was invited to be in Eurovision. And after that, it has been in the song contest ever since. So, it doesn't really matter that it is geographically connected to Asia. You just have to be apart of the EBU. ",

            "answer_text": "Ignore the other answers on here, because they are wrong. The simple answer is that the Eurovision Song Contest is run by the European Broadcasting Union, an affiliation of public service broadcasters across Europe. The contest is open to any country who is a member. In addition to full members there are also affiliates, of which Australia and Israel are two. Countries like Libya, Turkey and Morocco are members as well, and have competed in the past. A couple of years ago, Israel had to withdraw because their main TV channel, who held the membership, was disbanded in a legal shakeup. It was a couple of years before another public service channel took it on and they were allowed back. Other countries, who now no longer exist, also had members at one time - for example Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. The EBU has also produced international choir competitions and the now defunct Jeux Sans Fronti\u00e8res, broadcast in the UK as It\u2019s A Knockout. ",
