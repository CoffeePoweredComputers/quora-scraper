But before I proceed with my humble solution, I want to tell you some time you need an iTunes. There is an Option in iTunes that backup your iPod, uncheck it. Don't Worry; it could be solved easily To reset your iPod with a click wheel, follow these steps: Slide the Hold switch to the locked position and then slide it to unlocked again.Press and hold the Menu and Center (or Select) buttons together until you see the Apple logo (about six to eight seconds). You might need to repeat this step.If your iPod won't respond when you press the buttons or won't turn on, it might be paused or the Hold switch might be in the locked position. If so, you'll see a lock symbol on the screen. Slide the Hold switch to the unlocked position, then try again. Resetting your iPod shouldn't affect these: Your music and other files \u00a0Most settings\u00a0The date and time\u2014unless your iPod lost power and reset when you plugged it into power\u00a0\u00a0Your Bookmarks, On-The-Go Playlists, Shuffle, and Backlight timer\u00a0Hope this could help, Just remember when you connect your iPod make sure you eject it from the icon in the iTunes  ",
