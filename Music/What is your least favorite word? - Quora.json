It wouldn\u2019t go anywhere if it was. Nobody lives in a house with fluffy walls, which you enter through a fluffy door, and switch on your fluffy telly. I\u2019ll tell you one thing that\u2019s fluffy, and it\u2019s a bloody pink horse (or it might be a unicorn, I\u2019ve never got near enough to find out) that my neice (10) has got. It\u2019s fluffy, it\u2019s pink and it sings. Incessantly. I really hate that toy. One day, whatever is providing the sound is going to suffer an irreversible breakdown, due to a short circuit. If I can get it in the close proximity of me and a metal screwdriver and not in the close proximity of my niece. But that still won\u2019t solve the awful problem of the pink fluffiness. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get away with sneaking out the back with it and a flamethrower and so daily I am accosted by this product from Satan Ltd. Toilet roll covers. They\u2019re always fluffy. Why do we need to cover toilet rolls? \u201cIt looks nice\u201d. No it does not. It looks as though we are some sort of discriminating bigots, denying the rolls their intrinsic cylindrical shape and forcing them to conform to our aesthetic and cultural standards, that\u2019s what it looks like. Fairground gonks are fluffy. Frankly they give me the creeps with their mental, staring eyes. I can\u2019t sleep if there\u2019s a fluffy gonk in the house because I have this vague and uneasy suspicion that I\u2019m going to wake up in the morning and find it\u2019s come alive and is trying to asphyxiate me by cramming its fluffy mass down my respiratory tract. Don\u2019t even get me started about candy floss. Cushions and pillows are often said to be fluffy. They may be on the inside but they have the decency to hide the fluffiness under a cotton skin. Cushions and pillows are therefore a force of good for the world. Or at least your butt-cheeks. Fluffy. Pah. Sod off fluffy, and whilst you\u2019re going, take \u201cfrilly\u201d with you. ",

            "answer_text": "Analytics. Over time, I have come to dislike this term. It is especially troubling in an environment that has been converted into a data-driven culture that is headed by those who think that they know how to interpret information when, in fact, they are comparing apples to oranges. It is with analytics and the other conflated terms associated that vital daily operations have become burdened with added bead counting tasks, as if they will make some genie appear from out of the mounds of added data. Too many places have joined the bandwagon of using statistics for virtually every facet that involves employees. What is the consequent of this mindset? Excessive micromanagement, where priorities can be so mishandled that the leading group\u2019s dictates essentially amounting to the figurative tail wagging the dog. So one could argue that in the wrong hands, which is all too common, analytics can lead to decisions where outliers, which can be either detrimental or beneficial, or essentially the make-or-break points, are ignored. Once again, the baby can still be thrown out with the bath water. In other words, under certain circumstances, which are not few in number, it is just as indifference is regarded as the true opposite of love, it is to the same extent that analytics is the antithesis of logistics.

            "answer_text": "Snowflake. Even before I was old enough to understand or participate in sociopolitical discussions, I recognized snowflake as an insult for someone who is different, has different needs, or appreciates themselves as an individual seperate from a group. It's always annoyed me\u2026 such a vulgar energy for such a beautiful imagery.  Snowflakes are all unique. That's the point of the insult. When you call someone a snowflake, you're calling them different. Unique. Special. Individual. Irreplaceable. Precious. This is to say one of two things: \u201cYou're not special,\u201d or, \u201cYou're special, and that's bad,\u201d or sometimes, weirdly, both. But that's all irrelevant. People are just like snowflakes. We all are unique. We literally are. Even when we're twins, we're unique. You literally can't be the same as someone else. All people are snowflakes. There is no moral value on being an individual. Everybody just is. Embracing that is healthy. Insulting it is just sad. Yes, I believe in community. I believe in teamwork, cohesivity, and collectivism. I believe that being part of a whole is beautiful. But that isn't the same as being identical to other people. Just like snowflakes band together to create a snowbank, individuals band together to make a community. Together or not, we are all unique. And we can all be unique together. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a least favourite word, and I am going to add my least favourite phrase if I may. My least favourite word is 'ego'.  I cannot even tell you why I dislike it so.  I think it must be psychological - after all it is a word borne from a psychoanalytical theory first identified by Freud.  He maintains the ego stops us doing things that are socially unacceptable, and allows us to see other measures that would be better suited in the event of an incident.  This can only be a good thing.  However, whenever I hear the word ego it seems to be always used in the wrong context i.e.  'His ego is bigger than his boots'.  'If her ego gets any bigger, she will not be able to get through the door'.   My least favourite words strung together are: 'with all due respect...'  if someone starts a sentence to me with these words the hairs on my neck gradually rise.  Someone once wrote it to me on a comment box to my question here and I was mortified.  It shows a lack of respect and arrogance.  And in my opinion it means that there ego is too big! ",

I'm in high school, and yes, that's where this hatred of required comes from, but bear in mind, it's not over learning a language, or even taking PE. It's taking a computer programming class where it takes 1/2 an hour to complete something on the board I could do in 10 minutes. I never need to know how to build a car online. But here I am, in school, building a car online. I hate it. And nothing will change my opinion. I'd rather be in an art class. ",

So, in summary, I just don\u2019t like this word. I feel that if someone needs to say they are transparent, then it\u2019s a red flag that we can see through them to the real truth. I don\u2019t mean to be negative\u2014-just cautious. It\u2019s tough for anyone or anything to really be 100% transparent! Funny word! ",

So you might as well do the same thing with Stentor and say that a stentee is someone who gets shouted at. ",
