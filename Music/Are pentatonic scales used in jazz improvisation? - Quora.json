            "answer_text": "Jazz musicians use pentatonics constantly, and the really hip jazz musicians use pentatonics from outside the key/chord. Here\u2019s what you get when you play all twelve possible minor pentatonic scales over an A root: A minor pentatonic: A blues, natural minor, Dorian and Phrygian modes.B-flat minor pentatonic: Nothing useful.B minor pentatonic: A sus, A major, or A7. Also A Dorian mode.C minor pentatonic: A altered scale. Resolve to D or D minor afterwards.D-flat minor pentatonic: Amaj7. Lovely.D minor pentatonic: A natural minor or A Phrygian mode.E-flat minor pentatonic: Nothing useful.E minor pentatonic: A7sus, from Mixolydian mode. Also A natural minor.F minor pentatonic: Nothing useful.G-flat minor pentatonic: A major pentatonic.G minor pentatonic: A Phrygian mode. Flamenco time!A-flat minor pentatonic: A Lydian mode. Awesome.If you're a guitarist, you can try these by playing the pentatonics on the D, G, B and high E strings, while letting the open A string ring underneath. Read more: The pentatonic box The beautiful thing about pentatonics is that they have such a strong internal structure that they still make sense when you play them way outside. John Coltrane's \"A Love Supreme\" uses a lot of pentatonic melodies, and there's that famous moment in the first part when he takes one of them through all twelve keys. ",

            "answer_text": "A common use of pent cales over the common 2\u20135\u20131 progression: II chord - Dm - play D minor pent, A minor pent and E minor pent These pents are each a 5th up from the last. D dorian is C major and the main 3 pents in C are C, F, G major/A, D, E minor pent. So they all contain notes from the Cmaj/D dorian scale but pent allows different interval ideas and lines in 4ths and so on. V chord - G7 play Db major/Bb minor pent, gives notes from Abmelodic minor or G alt dom. Also Ab min6 pent over G7 is nice - Ab, B, Db, Eb, F I chord - Cmaj7 play C, G, D maj pent or A, E, B minor pent. C and G give notes from Ionian and D gives the F# from C lydian. That is just one basic way to get inside sounding \u201cmodern-ish\u201d pent lines. Coltrane made this popular. Another outside trick is to side-step - if playing A minor pent switch to Bb or Ab minor, down or up a half step then resolve back to A minor. Stacking pents in 5ths is an outside concept - Over a Dm play a phrase from Dm pent, then up higher play some Am pent, then higher up play Em pent then Bm, F#m and so on. At some point you have to descend but the idea is to not bunch them up. It creates a very spacey sound. I like pents in jazz/fusion for creating 4ths lines. Generally pent has 2 notes per string so if you just play one note per string you will get stacks of 4ths in the key. Same with pent chords. Also playing 3 pent notes per string makes some cool intervallic lines. Jerry Bergonzi has an entire book on jazz pents and how to create awesome patterns with them (as well as the theory I mentioned). It\u2019s an amazing book. It covers everything pent in jazz. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, of course. Let me add to the other good answers: as a nice occasional choice, or as a gone-stupid-on-the-stand choice, you can use a single pentatonic scale on a ii-V7-I cell. Just use the pentatonic scale based on the V. Note (hah!) that the pent contains all \u201csafe\u201d notes for each chord. For example, in the key of C: ii-V7-I is Dm-G7-CM7.G pentatonic is G A B D EDm is D F A B C E (The G is safe, because the chord is minor. Your mileage may vary on using a B vs. a C)G7 is G B D F ACM7 is C E G B DSo, if you use the V pentatonic, you\u2019ll hit no \u201cavoid\u201d notes in a ii-V7-I cell. Get an Aebersold track and try it. Listen to the sound. Then, when you\u2019re bored with it, learn to throw in notes specific to each chord (like the F or the C) when appropriate, along with the usual passing tones, neighbouring tones, and so on. ( I found this in Levine\u2019s theory book: The Jazz Theory Book ) ",

The note A is added as a grace note, usually going up to the B flat but sometimes going down to the A flat as a dissonance. Sometimes you see it minus the grace note with G flat as the root, which can be called the major blues scale. Pentatonic refers to any five tone scale. There is a five tone scale with a different interval structure (including two semitones) associated with Zen Buddhism. ",

            "answer_text": "Jazz scales evolved from the blues scale, which uses both natural and lowered 3rd and 7th, and went on to add the raised 4th and ultimately most of the major/minor scale. It should be noted that \u2014 in another instance of blues influence \u2014 bending the scale notes (or playing \u201cin the cracks\u201d) is routine; in effect, the jazz scale can incorporate an infinite number of tones. Pentatonic scales rarely have enough melodic material to support lengthy improvisation, although occasional phrases can provide a nice contrast to the richer, larger scale. ",

Just this week I've been reviewing some major and minor pentatonic scales from a jazz piano book. There's an example of a Count Basie solo based entirely on a minor pentatonic scale.  However, most jazz improvisation that I've been exposed to will probably not adhere to the straight-up, 5-note pentatonic scale. Other tones are infused to add more interesting color. Add in the flat 5 and your playing blues essentially, of which there are endless examples of in jazz. ",
