            "answer_text": "No, for a couple of reasons. Dampers. When you hit a key on an acoustic piano, what happens is that the key, which is a lever, pushes a very complicated mechanism called a hammer which then strikes the string(s) with however much force you put into it. During the process, the damper raises up so that the string will resonate, and it comes back down to stop the sound when you release the key. Depending on the thickness and length of the string, that dampening may have a wide variety of decay times (the lower the string, the longer it takes to dampen), tone, overtones (if the dampener is on a node of the string), etc. If you're using the sustain pedal, which lifts all of the dampers off every string, you can also control how quickly or slowly you apply the dampers back onto the string, which professionals do in order to manipulate the sound. An electric keyboard, on the other hand, may have sampled sounds from a $500,000 grand piano, but it probably doesn't take into account the variety of ways you can dampen the sound on an acoustic piano. I would guess most don't even sample the dampers from a real piano, opting instead to simply fade the note out digitally, which gives you a more pure release, but not at all the kind of sound an acoustic piano will give you. And releases are a very important part of how any instrument sounds overall. Tone. Believe it or not, a good pianist can manipulate the way the hammer strikes the keys to get different tones: light, dark, warm, chilly, singing, etc. Whatever the piece calls for. It's subtle, but you can tell the difference between the harshness an amateur brings out of the piano and the lush warmth a pro gets. I got an excellent comment from David Zhuravlev on how exactly one gets different tone out of an acoustic piano which I am copying verbatim: The interesting thing about the piano keys is that there is a distinct moment of impact of the hammer with the string, but it is not instant, or at least it doesn't feel that way. That is to say, the speed and acceleration of the hammer during impact can be varied to create a different sound pattern on the string. I don't know how accurate this is in reality but that's how I end up thinking about it while playing. Another way to vary the sound is via the hammer cushioning the string after the key is released. This cushioning is also not instant, so a careful release can produce a different feeling than a sudden one. What I know for certain is that different possibilities in expression are subtle enough that visualizing lifting your hand upwards versus pushing down into the keys produce a noticeably different sound, even as you play the exact same chord both times. This extends to your upper body language as well, and simply imagining how the audience hears the music - all these things can have a tangible effect on sound quality. I cannot firmly say that a single note or chord can be enough to produce a recognizably \"dark\" or \"warm\" feeling without emotional context, but as soon as you combine just a few notes, the complexity simply explodes and the possibilities become endless. An electric keyboard, however, likely has only one sample of tone for each note. It is un-manipulate-able, and a professional would be able to tell. It limits the amount of artistry one can bring to a song. That's not to say an electric keyboard can't sound good or that you can't bring artistry to it. In fact, the keyboard is really the successor to the organ, which also has un-manipulate-able tone and only one way to release notes. And also like keyboard, the organ can change its sounds via which pipes it uses. But when comparing the piano side of a keyboard and an acoustic, the acoustic is simply more versatile. EDIT: Apparently organists do have some control over their releases. So that point goes to the organ.  EDIT: I have been informed by the comment section that the most modern piano software uses physical modeling to synthesized the sound, even to the point of modeling the dampers, the clacking of the keys and hammers, and the sympathetic resonance you get depending on which strings are undampened. In other words, it's basically a simulation of a real, physical piano. Given how technology, especially software, tends to progress, I would not be surprised if they can one day get the algorithm down to the point where it's nigh indistinguishable from a real piano. It's already pretty close. However, I would still say no to the question. Even this modeling, as it currently stands, cannot match the capabilities of a really good grand piano. The main reason for this is currently hardware, actually. As I mentioned with the tone aspect of a real piano, while the software may be able to replicate each and every way the hammer can strike the strings, I am doubtful that there exists a keyboard that properly models the way a hammer works and inputs that data into the physical modeling software. You can't map all that data into a MIDI output stream. That's not to say it can't be done, though. And currently, you would have to tell the software how to process each and every hammer strike to match what one can do one an acoustic piano on the fly. EDIT: There's also the matter of where the sound is actually produced. A keyboard uses speakers, while a piano has 88 different locations that the sounds come from. Even with the best speakers in the world, the directionality of the sound would be a dead giveaway in most cases. We humans are pretty good at telling where sound is coming from. ",

            "answer_text": "Can a digital piano actually duplicate the sound of a $50,000.00 acoustic piano? Confusion reigns within the answers so far. Let\u2019s cut through it. Sound is a waveform. If you can produce an identical waveform to that produced by the $50k acoustic piano, then you\u2019ve duplicated the sound.Can an identical waveform be produced?Yes.However\u2026 sound is propagated through the air to the listening/measuring position. If you change the listening position, you get a different waveform. From where are you sampling the two sounds? This brings us to point 2.Sound is produced by a vibrating material causing the air to vibrate through serial compressions.Can a speaker cause the same compressions throughout the air on a room as the combination of strings and soundboard in a piano?No.The waveform might be identical at the point referred to above - the listening/measuring position, BUT WILL DIFFER ELSEWHERE IN THE SPACE because the sound is emanating from a differently shaped source\u2026 a set of speaker cones that are isolated from their housing, rather than a flat, shaped soundboard which is part of a housing containing strings that also cause the housing to vibrate in all directions.In other words, the waveform is being produced from a virtual POINT source, rather than a WIDELY DISTRIBUTED source.What all that means is that even though the digital instrument is producing the same waveform, the sound will not propagate through the room in the same way, so you can always tell the difference. HOWEVER. When you play back a recording of the real piano, both that sound and the digital sound are being reproduced through speakers, so they propagate through the room in the same way and are very difficult to tell apart. Blind testing shows that humans simply can\u2019t reliably tell which recording is the real piano\u2026 although when listening to the two repeatedly they can correctly identify A or B, they don\u2019t know which is the real instrument.

            "answer_text": "For the most part, yes. The best option in my opinion is to use a keyboard as MIDI controller, connect it to a computer, and use a computer to generate the sounds. A program like Pianoteq synthesizes the sounds of various instruments (note that this is different from sampling, which is essentially playing a recording), and does so using very sophisticated algorithms known as \u201cphysically modeling.\u201d Compared to sampling, the physically modeled synthesizers do better at such things as sympathetic resonance, which is very complex and dependent on which dampers are currently touching which strings. Best thing about this is if your digital piano (or MIDI controller) is a few years old, no problem, just get the latest update to the software on your computer. This stuff is getting better every year. Hardware technology (i.e. the keys and weighting mechanism and sensors) doesn\u2019t change quickly, but software is changing fast. Note that if you are making a recording, you don\u2019t have to worry about putting microphones on the piano\u2026.just record it directly through the computer. That\u2019s almost always going to make it sound better, unless you happen to own a recording studio or at least all the requisite equipment to record quality sound. And of course you can do all kinds of other things you can\u2019t do with that $50k piano: choose different sounds (want it to sound like a different model piano? A Hammond organ? A Fender Rhodes electric piano? Church bells? A vibraphone?) Want to record your playing as MIDI, then tweak the notes, or modify the instrument after the fact, and only then record it as audio? And let\u2019s not forget the ability to put on headphones, or the ability to toss it in your car so you can meet up with others. If all you want is an exact reproduction of an acoustic piano, a digital version is not going to be 100% perfect, but I suspect the differences are incredibly minor. ",

            "answer_text": "Strictly speaking, it can\u2019t duplicate it the same reason your speakers can\u2019t duplicate the New York Philharmonic, but for most intents and purposes the technology is pretty close if not already there, if you\u2019re willing to spend money. This is not to say that if you walk into a store and turn on any digital piano that it\u2019ll sound like the real thing, because the onboard sound engines usually do not have very good modelling or sampling, and the built in speakers are almost always not up to the task (a notable exception I would say is the Kawai CA95/97/98, which has a big wood \u201csoundboard\u201d with ribs in the back, which really helps make the bass come alive). The tone of a real piano is produced by the hammers and for the most part, the only thing that matters is hammer velocity when it strikes, because the hammer itself can\u2019t be changed. Theoretically you could nitpick and say that a very heavy tap to the key can induce more bending of the hammer shank than a consistent key press and alter the angle at which the hammer will strike the strings, but in practice you usually don\u2019t play that way, and many good pianos have really stiff hammer shanks that won\u2019t exhibit much deflection. Sampled pianos with a hundred sampling layers can get the tone and decay to sound just like the real thing for all intents and purposes, and I think modeled pianos do a great job as well. As far as damping goes, the MIDI spec has a velocity for \u201cnote off\u201d which in principle can be used to model damping very well, but most digital pianos don\u2019t do this well yet. In practice the difference is very small as most of the time, the pianist releases the keys and the damping happens very quickly. If the keys are being released very slowly on a real piano, you can get a \u201chalf pedal\u201d effect with just your fingers that most (maybe all) digital pianos won\u2019t reproduce correctly, but again this isn\u2019t really something the audience will notice. I haven\u2019t tried the Kawai Novus NV10 yet, but I think that piano is supposed to have dedicated sensors on the imitation damper mechanism, and they might have incorporated those sensor outputs continuously into their sound engine. For all practical intents and purposes, I think an NV10 hooked up to a very good speaker system is pretty much an acceptable substitute for a real piano, apart from the aesthetic and emotional value of having a fine acoustic instrument.

            "answer_text": "It depends how you are comparing it. If you are playing the digital piano next to the acoustic piano, I have never seen it done. We have several instruments at my organization. One, in particular, is a Yamaha C7X grand piano (7\u20326\u2033) which cost me $48,000 (close enough to the $50,000), and a Yamaha CVP 709 Clavinova (top of the line) digital piano. Side by side, the grand piano is far superior as it is projecting the sound acoustically while the digital piano is projecting sound via speakers. If you are creating a recording, it might be harder to discern between the two. However, you did not indicate the duplication to be that of a recording or comparing side by side. And the sound sampled for the Clavinova is a nine-foot concert grand. Still, side by side, the 7\u20326\u2033 acoustic sounds much better. Anyone visiting the studio hearing the instruments side by side has never sided with the digital piano. There are several factors that make the sound better with the C7X, e.g., sustain power, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "I suspect that a \u201cdigital piano\u201d could - if enough effort was put into the speaker system, the algorithms, and the keyboard haptics. But that\u2019d likely raise the cost to something comparable to $50,000 - and a major goal of a digital piano is to reduce the cost. Of that I mention above, the speaker system and the keyboard (and pedal) haptics (feedback) would be the most important. The resonance chamber of a piano is a far more sophisticated device than a pair of (nearly) commodity speakers sitting on a stage. The speakers can offer a good approximation - but you\u2019d need an array of speakers with careful timing and phase relationships between the signals driving them to duplicate the acoustic piano, and you\u2019d need to include speakers in order to provide the right feedback to the pianist. I don\u2019t doubt that digital (electronic) pianos can be fine instruments. For some performances, they could be superior. But they\u2019re different - although similar (in some ways) to acoustic pianos. There\u2019s plenty of areas where either kind of piano would serve well - and so a digital piano might have an advantage due to cost and maintenance. ",

            "answer_text": "No. That is the short answer. It is very impressive how close digital pianos can come to the sound of a $50,000 piano but it is not the same. Yamaha is famous for its digital piano sound because it is recorded straight from the original acoustic instrument. However it is still not the same. I practice classical and improvisational music for hours at a time. When I was given my Yamaha Motif XF8 years ago I was told I would never want anything other than a digital instrument. While I LOVE my Motif for many reasons I still want the following: -A $60,000 Steinway. -A $26,000 Mason & Hamlin I met one day that has flowers inlaid in the wood. -A $132,000 Fazioli. One other side note that is not what you asked: even if the sound could be perfectly mimicked, the feel still cannot. To me, playing a digital piano versus a $50,000 acoustic one is the equivalent of playing the Lamborghini arcade game versus driving the real thing. It will not feel or sound exactly the same. The only thing a digital piano did for me that an acoustic one did not is remove the fear of being overheard. For the first time I could use headphones and play as if I was not afraid of how I sounded, and I have played that way ever since. ",

Who says they ever really HAVE TO sound and feel identical, even if they can or will? Newer, very inexpensive non-weighted keyboards are developing very mature and poetically pleasing nuances in musical sound production and response to touch that make them desirable and fully capable musical instruments on their own merits and characteristics; and available to anyone. They are a new and very wonderful instrument. ",

Emulation of sounds from an acoustic keyboard is fairly easy in that respect but the one you can\u2019t emulate, sadly, is the feel and overall presence of an acoustic piano; for a number of different reasons but the flexibility of a great digital piano (such as the Nord stage or Yamaha Montage) cannot be denied with access to numerous Effects and various other models of pianos, keyboards and synthesisers. On top of that they are very portable and come in a variety of different sizes with different feeling key beds. ",
