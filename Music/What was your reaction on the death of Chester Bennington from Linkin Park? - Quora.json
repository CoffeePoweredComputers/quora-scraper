            "answer_text": "Honestly, I never held suicide in high regard. Not until this news (of his death) hit me one fine night when I was just checking through my social media feed. Just wished and hoped it was one of those innumerable celebrity death hoax that go around and I so wished for it to be just that and nothing more. But the more I scrolled my feed, the more posts and news started showing up with Chester\u2019s death all over it. This news was like those nightmares you try so hard to run away from but you never can. I never knew a celeb death could leave me taking such a big hit. As the reality set in I had to accept the truth for he was indeed no more. It was sadness, anguish, anger and whole range of everything else that my mind couldn\u2019t place the exact emotion at that very moment. That entire week I drowned myself listening to just Linkin Park! Never could anyone think the man behind such great and inspirational music that gave us the youth gems like - In the end, Crawling, Numb, Somewhere I belong, Faint etc., would one day end up taking his own life as suicide. It was a big blow to all his fans that none of us saw coming. Just goes on to show how depression eats a person from inside - no matter if you\u2019re a celeb or a common person, it is never a good place to be in and destroys you and those around you. Chester\u2019s legacy is unmatched and his music will live on forever- for being an inspiration having battled everyday internally yet braving with a big smile for his family, friends, fans and the world to see. Linkin Park will never be the same without Chester!! Quoting from one of his songs (shadow of the day): Sometimes beginnings aren't so simpleSometimes goodbye's the only way #ChesterForever  ",

            "answer_text": "I needed an explanation. July 20th I remember that evening distinctly. I was doing some random stuff in my room when my friend sent me something like this  Of course I didn't believe it. It was only after numerous Google searches that I got hold of the situation. What really hit me was this.  POOF. Just like that, he was gone. One minute I was dreaming of attending a much overdue LP concert in my country (India) and the next it was all gone. Just like that. But I did not cry. Not a single tear showed itself. I was actually thinking that I SHOULD cry. This was a reason horrible enough to weep for. I was a bit heavy in the chest but could not bring myself to cry. (Mind you, I am an LP soldier. Have all their records and have stalked them well enough to know all about their personal lives, each and every one of the six.) I did cry though. The next day, I was playing LP on my phone and randomly One More Light started playing. This brought tears to my eyes. It went all through the song. I had no more thought. Just a void in me that refused to budge. It was a strange, heavy feeling. But it went away soon though.(Guess I'm not much of a cry person after all) That night, I was sitting at my desk, feeling sultry and tired. I just did not have the energy to do anything. I felt empty and incomplete. It was then that I had this strange thought:- I need an explanation Chester. You can't just Die. You can't just leave all of a sudden, shattering a million dreams for your own whimsical gratification. No. You better give me a reason valid enough for taking such a stupid step. You can't just change so many lives and disappear all of a sudden. This is not done. No. NOOOO. Fuck. Fuck And then the tears came. This was the first time I actually, like really cried. Hard. Like Pudge Halter and Colonel Martin, I wanted an explanation. This filled my head, obliterating all other thought. ONE GODDAMN EXPLANATION. But I couldn't have it. He was cruelly snatched away to the place of no return. It was then that I truly comprehended what I had lost, what the whole world had lost, what music had lost. With one of it's most powerful and inspiring voices lost, music could never be the same again. Silent tears is probably the best way to describe my reaction. Thanks for giving me an opportunity to let it off my chest. After all this time, I feel like I really needed it. Peace and respect, FreeVonDoo ",
