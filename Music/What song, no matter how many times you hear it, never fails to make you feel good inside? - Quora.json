            "answer_text": "I\u2019m gonna shoot outside the box here. I believe songs with words are the most vulnerable to turning any affect or affinity on its head. So if you want something that always feels good, go for instrumental. That\u2019s pure unadulterated emotion. I submit  Blue Water Blue Sky, a song from the original soundtrack of Guilty Gear X2, a song that even without any context at all reveals humankind\u2019s true love for adventure and fulfillment, an urge to act in the little time one has on this Earth and in this life. There have been many occasions I have heard this song in a bad mood or on a sour day, and had my entire mental direction turned around. It makes me feel in my body what I thought was not there. Motivation, letting go of stress, and working toward a goal of living your life. Open your eyes. You can\u2019t not smile when there\u2019s a blue sky over blue water. ",
