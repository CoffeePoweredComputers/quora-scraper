            "answer_text": "Depends on the band, the producer and the engineer. A lot of times the Beatles, Stones, Eagles and Doors did most of it all at once. Sometimes there are a few overdubs. Other bands may start with the basic tracks. When the song is complex it might be done in pieces. One ballad that I did we did the intro as one piece. The main song as basic tracks. The middle break as an overdubs acoustic track. We did all the vocals separately. A lot of bands do the Vocals and Lead solos as over dubs. You have to remember that up until 1960 there were only 2 track recorders and they would bounce track from one machine to another (Buddy Holly and Les Paul). From 1960 to 1967 there were only 4 track machines. The Beatles would record all the basic tracks on 1 track, the vocals and solos on the other 3 track. Sometimes they\u2019d bounce from one 4 track to another 4 track. Starting in 1968 they had 8 track machines and by the early 1970s 16 track machines. These allowed them to put drums on two or three tracks and the rest of the band on the remaining tracks. They still often did vocals separately. By 1980 there were 24 track machines everywhere. Some 16 track machines could be retrofitted with 8 more preamps and a new head stack. Most 24 track machines could be outfitted with 16 track head stacks (wider individual track recording area). Now with ProTools major studios can have 128 tracks of audio (or more) and 256 or 512 tracks of MIDI, of course most studios are only equipped to record 24 to 32 track at one time, because they kept their old boards and have to buy preamp cards in 4 and 8 track configurations at a very expensive price and daisy chain these together. For the song Dreams by Fleetwood Mac the first tracks were drums, bass and scratch vocals. They ended up using 80% of the scratch vocals because her performance shined. About 20% were overdubed. So were keyboards and guitars. The lead guitar was recorded using several sources. Through a Leslie, through an amp, and other ways. They lost high end on the original master tapes so for some cuts they used two machines and ran the protection copy (a 2nd generation analog master) and the original together and kept them in sync by hand listening to the drum hits. With a Allman Brothers session, Dickie Betts played his solo as an overdub and their producer had him redo it several times because he heard better versions in rehearsal and live sessions. All recordings made before 1955 were mono. All recordings made before 1948 were direct to laquer disk. These were done with careful microphone placement and an engineer who turned knobs by hand and listened to what was being played. The vocals and music were done at once. Some Jazz records in the 1970s and even into the 1980s were done direct to Lacquer. Why? Tape does funny things to the sound of a piano that lacquer disks don\u2019t do! Also tape has hiss. The Grateful Dead spliced 16 and 24 track tapes together to make some of their songs on the early albums. I knew one artist and the studio he went to would \u201cplug\u201d a 24 track tape with a spliced section on just a few tracks (not sure why anyone would do that). I saw the tape. There\u2019d be a few inches long and wide with white spicing tape on the shiny side of the 2\u2033 24 track. The used a razor blade to cut out the section. I\u2019d just mute the track. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the band. Some do it one way and some do it another. Ringo for instance perfers the whole band to play and they don\u2019t use amps, they plug in direct to the board. And old Beatles trick. Paul on the other hand is apt to go in and lay down a piano or guitar with a guide vocal. Then the other musicians come in and lay their parts down. Drummer usually by himself. Final vocals usually go on last. I know some band members had home studios and will do a rough demo. But the demo. Usually of guitar or piano and a guide vocal. Brings that into the studio and the band members add to it. ",

            "answer_text": "It can be done LIVE with everyone there, but instruments will need to be separated so they don\u2019t bleed into each other. You can also do individual tracking. I\u2019d say a combination of both will open up endless possibilities. I\u2019m finding lately to get basic tracks with guitar, bass, drums, and a scratch vocal. At that point, you can overdub and punch in parts until you\u2019re satisfied. One last point, if you\u2019re sequencing keyboard parts, you\u2019ll need to record with a metronome, commonly referred to as a click track. It\u2019s must harder to do it this way, but the timing will help everyone synchronize. I recorded a project in 2008\u2014over 40 songs. I had to play every one with a click track. It was brutal, but it did improve my timing tremendously. It also forced me to take risks, which helped my chops develop, especially my double bass drumming. Cheers, Evan J. www.evanj31drum.com ",

            "answer_text": "My dad\u2019s friend Stan White liked Duke Ellington because he asked Stan to just set up a mic, and they would work to get it right, and once it was, he could sit back and let the tape roll till the end of the session (one of the worst things that can happen is to make a great rendition of a song and find you didn\u2019t ask the man to turn the machine on!) Others, he said, were fussier; but in general it was much simpler. However, a studio recording may more typically have either each member in a separate room, each wearing a headset (so you can have absolute integrity of each instrument track, so you can edit more easily), or have the whole band play together - so they will play more musically - but have mics attached to instruments or very focused so you can still have multi-tracks (again, to satisfy this fussy generation\u2019s mania for perfection, and edit out the slightest error, improve a weak tone, etc.). And there may be many more methods - each studio has its own concept of how to do it, and develops its reputation thereby. ",

The last few Beatles studio albums had tracks on them where none of the band members heard were in each other's presence when recorded. Some performers are virtually single-person bands all by themselves, playing many parts and then laying down the pieces into a whole. In the last half a century or so, technology has made the making of music something that the classical composers of yesteryear would not have believed possible. ",

If you listen to the Forum performances on this expanded edition of Hotel California, or ever saw the group in concert back in the day, you already know the Eagles were one of the best live acts of the 1970s. But the band wanted to drive home the point that for all their fussy string arrangements and elaborate grooves, they were perfectly capable of playing live to tape \u2014 and when they cut the guitar-heavy side-two highlight \"Victim of Love\" that way, Szymczyk decided to commemorate the occasion.
