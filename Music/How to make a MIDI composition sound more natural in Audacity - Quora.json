            "answer_text": "Not really. If you want to make it sound more natural you need to work with velocity (let's say the volume of each note) and duration. Velocity and duration are midi parameters that can be edited with many notation software, including Finale. If you are working with Finale you can add a little reverb and delay to your track. Otherwise you can do it with Audacity, but I don't think that you can do it with a midi file on Audacity. I think that you have to get the audio file first. ",
