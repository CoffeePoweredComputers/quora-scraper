            "answer_text": "Honestly, the main reason why people don\u2019t like accepting EXO and BTS as legends is because of second generation fans (not all fans!). I completely get why the second generation stans are so protective over this title - they don\u2019t like the idea of new groups sharing the titles of their old groups. I\u2019m a second generation fan myself; I grew up alongside Kara, 4minute, 2NE1, SNSD, Big Bang, SHINee, MBLAQ, etc., and I was a hardcore Sone as a child. They were literally the first Kpop group I remember as a child and got so fixated on them, I remember watching all the variety shows they went on. Letting go of a title is something every group has to do, but I appreciate the fact that SNSD carried on something that S.E.S did, and some other group will carry on the baton from SNSD. Obviously I appreciate all that the second generation have done - each generation has paved a way, but to deny BTS and EXO of that status (to me) seems a bit ridiculous. The first generation began the whole thing, yet you don\u2019t see second generation stans hyping up S.E.S or G.O.D or Fly to the Sky, etc. I don\u2019t know if second generation fans are perhaps insecure, but kpop fans don\u2019t always have to mention the second generation groups to respect them. They are a part of history that cannot be erased, and if it weren\u2019t for every group that was and is in the kpop scene, kpop would not be where it is now. But EXO and BTS broke records, paved new paths, and if it wasn\u2019t for them, the fourth generation would not be able to be where they are now too. You see more groups being shown on American shows like Buzzfeed, Billboard, Vanity Fair etc. - and that wouldn\u2019t have been possible without them paving the way. I\u2019m not saying western recognition is everything, but America has the biggest music industry in the world, and to break through that would be a dream for every band in the whole world. I\u2019m going off on a tangent here, but I think it\u2019s mostly because of insecurity and protectiveness, and maybe a bit of not wanting to let go of the past. ",

            "answer_text": "Because they are not that old lol. Yea, they are really good at what they're doing and work hard but calling them legends it's weird. Michael Jackson is a legend, everyone agrees on that but you wouldn't put him in the same group with Exo and BTS and say \u201coh, they all have the same level of greatness\u201d, even the members from these groups wouldn't agree with this. They are talented but they debuted a few years ago, it hasn't been a decade since they debuted. You can't call them legends if they debuted 5\u20136 years ago. It's the same thing as a 15\u201316 y.o. saying that he is an adult, yea, he is grown up, more mature than before but you can't call him an adult. A legend besides talent and won prizes has seniority. Admit that they are good at what they're doing, are talented but don't call them old yet. Jungkook is only 21, stop pretending that he is 30 something. You will have time to call them legends too. Hope it helps. ",
