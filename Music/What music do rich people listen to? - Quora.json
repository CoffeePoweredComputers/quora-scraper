            "answer_text": "It will depend on your youth and/or your background. People usually like the music their parents and their closest friends like. You can think of music as an acquired taste. If you are \u201cborn into\u201d folk music, you will like folk music. If you during your youth your parents listened to classical and jazz, even if you did prefer disco music and rock whilst with your friends, you will eventually enjoy classical and jazz.  Many people can have a lot of money but that does not necessarily mean they are going to like Jazz and Classical music or Opera. The \u201cnouveau riche\u201d for instances, usually come from modest surroundings, and it may be difficult for them to enjoy some types of music. But again, this does not mean they will only like commercial music. There are plenty of musicians that play in orchestras and many of them come from more modest surroundings. The implication is that, being of lower, or middle-class origin, these individuals lack the taste to properly \u201cuse\u201d wealth. Hence, this class of people is sometimes ill-regarded by old money as culturally inferior, comparatively lacking in pedigree and subtlety.  The \u201ctruly rich\u201d or those who come from wealthy families, they may like many music on the \u201ctop 100\u201d but they will also have an acquired taste for Opera and Classical, because they attend more classical concerts and go to the Opera with their friends. Its part of the \u201critual\u201d. You enjoy or learn to enjoy art galleries, you enjoy Opera houses, you enjoy concert halls, because that is what you do with your friends. They fit within a social milieu in which everyone knows everyone else and has for generations.  The \"nouveau riche\" in essence try to crash this party by buying everything they need to show that they have money. 'New Rich.' refers to wealthy people who aren't from \u201cold money\u201d or aren't \u201cblue blooded\u201d. They may be rich, but they're not socially accepted yet by those who have had wealth in their family for generations. Mainly because of their \u201ctastes\u201d. And usually, one of those tastes is certainly music, amongst others, of course.  Whatever song, mix, or instrument you\u2019re about to listen next through your speakers will most likely cause your brain to release dopamine. However, this will only occur if you play a song that you enjoy listening to, and how quickly will you decide whether or not you like a \u201cnew sound\u201d.  There are determining factors that make up your brain\u2019s mind. The connections between the brain\u2019s \u2018pleasure center\u2019 and its surrounding regions such as the amygdala, which processes emotion, and the hippocampus, which is important for memory, will predict how much you will like a certain type of music or a song.  Our brains create \u201cmusical memory templates\u201d based on past musical experiences we\u2019ve had. Depending on what styles of music your brain has recorded, it will choose to reactivate them, or not, when listening to a new piece of music. Basically, your brain\u2019s pleasure center predicts how you\u2019ll feel from a song based on similar music you\u2019ve heard. If you\u2019ve never heard classical music before, and your brain has no musical template for it, then odds are you will feel bored or disappointed after turning on a new classical piece.  This helps to explain why new music that fits under a genre you\u2019re very familiar with or love is so easily enjoyed. Your brain might just have the biggest pleasure response for that style of music because it has a lot of its particular \u201cmusical template\u201d stored. And, individuals go through different phases with their musical preferences, usually the memories from their youth will dictate their choice in music. Wealthy or not, it does not matter. Music is like a language. You can even consider it a a social tool that has produced a powerful effect on cultures all across the world. AS I mentioned above, when people around you, family, friends, or coworkers repetitively listen to a certain style of music, you will eventually catch on, and your brain will create a musical template for that style. In the end it will always be related to the way they were brought up, and the music choices of their family and friends as they grew up. ",

            "answer_text": "Music, that's it. You may think they all listen to classical but that's far from the truth, even if wealthy benefactors contribute to classical groups and venues often. Their musical choices are as diverse as anyone else's. President Obama has a large net worth, his musical taste (according to his Spotify playlist) range from Mala Rodriguez to The Temptations to Bob Dylan. Beyonce and Jay-Z have a collective net worth of about a billion dollars. They obviously listen to their own music and the music of their colleagues and the performers before them who serve as inspiration. David Koch recently donated a very large sum to Lincoln Center in New York in exchange for his name to replace Avery Fisher's on the principal hall of the New York Philharmonic, he must've listened to one symphony in his life. Your wealth does not determine what music you listen to, this question is impossible to answer. ",
