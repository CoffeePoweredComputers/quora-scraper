            "answer_text": "\u201cBest\u201d depends quite a bit on what you need. But essentially, for under $1000 you can get a nice instrument that has excellent prepared sounds and perhaps some \u201cmixing\u201d ability, but no ability to manufacture your own sounds from scratch. My Yamaha CP-33 Stage Piano, which cost me $999 several years ago, is one such. It has three pianos, a church organ, a jazz organ, harpsichord, guitar, voice oohs, string bass, bass guitar and marimba, and an \u201calternate\u201d button to transform the character of each. You can play two of these at once, either by mixing the tones or splitting them (piano in RH, bass in LH, for instance, at a split point of your choice). It features bullet-proof Yamaha workmanship, and weighs about 70 pounds, which is fun carrying up an icy staircase in the winter. Generally Yamaha, Korg and Roland have long histories of excellence and durability; I am not familiar with some of the newer brands. I chose the CP-33 because it made tones instantly accessible without \u201chiccup\u201d, and I could spontaneously change settings. I am a spontaneous player; it has presets but I have never used them. What it does have is a two-channel mixer, one for each of those two sounds you can select simultaneously, and it works like a fader. Easy, and you can see what you have at a glance. No monkey business. Some instruments have such horrible things as volume and tempo changers that you have to press and hold down to make them work! They must have been designed by CPA\u2019s instead of musicians. I use the CP at church, where I often switch from one sort of setting quickly to another, while attending to a choir or such at the same time. I need an instrument that is not going to betray me. Some instruments have more sounds, but to accomplish this they put them in layers and layers, and have ONLY ONE READOUT to tell you what you have set up! To get an instrument with \u201cweighted keys\u201d (which simulate a real piano), you pretty much have to get up around $1,000. If you can live with lighter keys and like to have lots and lots of tonal color available, or pre-manufactured rhythm accompaniments, then you can get a nice instrument for half of a thousand. But you\u2019ll also get that nasty single readout and tons of confusion trying to set up the sound you found one day, but can no longer remember exactly how you came by it. ",
