            "answer_text": "I see a lot of \u201cplastic surgery\u201d comments, but that\u2019s not true for new generation idols (I\u2019d say 2011 and onwards). Plastic surgery is mostly for 1st and 2nd gen idols, like Super Junior and SNSD. A large part of the fanbase has moved away from admiring plastic surgery and on to supporting natural beauty. New idols, in general, have at most double eyelid surgery. That\u2019s more targeted towards the Asian audience, as Western audiences don\u2019t have as much admiration for double eyelids as Asians do. Even then, companies look for natural beauty in the first place, and do tiny bits of surgery here and there. You have to be somewhat good looking to be accepted in the first place, after all. I\u2019d say companies look for good-looks first, over anything else. Singing and dancing can be trained into them with rigorous practice. If you look at TWICE, most of the group is purely visual, with less skill in other components than other girl groups. But, with each new song, they get better at singing and dancing. That hard line of beauty is distinct in Korea, and so good looking people would naturally get chosen, because as long as they have dedication, they can sing with little difference to other people that have more training. It\u2019s a brutal system, but that\u2019s how they cherry pick beauty over skill. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, K-pop idols are just like any other celebrity: those who are good looking tend to be more attractive to potential fans than those who aren\u2019t as good looking. Visuals are the first thing people see, which is probably one of the most important factors in a first impression. A good looking person is more likely to give off a good first impression than someone who isn\u2019t, right? Of course, K-pop idols should not only rely on visuals\u2014 there should be talent and good music there too. But unfortunately, a K-pop idol with good looks and average talent is more likely to be noticed than one who has good talent and average looks. Secondly, not all of it is natural beauty. There are likely going to be some idols that have had plastic surgery and some who didn\u2019t. But, we shouldn\u2019t judge them because of whether or not they had surgery. Hopefully this answered your question! Remember, don\u2019t judge a book by its cover. Just because someone is not good looking, doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have talent! ",
