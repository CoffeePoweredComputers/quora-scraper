            "answer_text": "I think some people don't realize the vastness of eternity. You are correct. How many times can you repeat a thing you enioy until you get bored with it? You may say a high number, let's say 100,000 as a drastic overestimation. How many different things could you possibly enjoy? Let's again for drastic overestimation say 10,000,000. Unrealistic, but stick with me here. As humans we can surely agree that most enjoyed experiences are fairly quick, most do not last more than a day. So let's aim at a high estimation of a day as an average length of time. Ok, simple math. 100,000 x 10,000,000 = 1,000,000,000,000 days or around 2.74b years could possibly be enjoyed, rough and very much an overestimation. 2.74b years may seem like a lot, but it would be a blink within the vastness of eternity. It may as well be literally a fraction of a second compared to eternity, it'd actually come to the same ratio. After the 2.74b years comes another 2.74b years 2.74b times over, and still you have eternity ahead of you. The point here is that eternity would be hell either way. The same logic applies to a negative experience, mind you. Miserable torture for eternity eventually would become bearable and mundane. It may actually be more interesting in that you can be no longer bothered past a point, but newcomers ARE bothered. So you are relatively doing just fine! In heaven, the opposite would occur, you get bored and hate existing while the newcomers are enamored. I suppose though that 2,000 years ago, a time traveler showing exploration with a helicopter, modern internet, the food we eat, the relative peace we enjoy, etc, to the earliest of Christians would garner the same type of response: absolute heaven! It is all relative and time is the great equalizer. Nothing can be good or bad eternally, everything eventually becomes normal. (Here's a better idea? Hell could be an eternity staring into a mirror and heaven could be the Christian concept of heaven on the weekends and hell on the weekdays. This way we would always have something to look forward to.) ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the kind of stuff you enjoy doing. Is Christmas boring? Do you love the time spent together with family or do you dread it? Is traveling to an exotic new land, like the Himalayans, exploring them and meeting new people boring or would you rather sit on the couch and watch TV? Do you imagine that meeting the Creator of the vast universe and be able to ask him any question you like would be a boring experience compared to say playing another round of Final Fantasy? Do you find participating in a music concert with your favorite band in a stadium full of excited fans boring compared to pulling up the same old play list and listening to the same old songs on your headset? The concept of heaven as a carrot and hell as a stick that exist only to try to make immoral people act a little better in this life IS BORING\u2014a tiresome product of limited thinking. But oh what the real thing will be like! \u201cThings which eye has not seen and ear has not heard, And which have not entered the heart of man, All that God has prepared for those who love Him.\u201d 1 Cor 2: You don't want to miss it!
