            "answer_text": "There are various factors that contribute to the recorded studio version of a song sounding better than the live performed version.  For one, the artists are not under as much pressure, there are in a more relaxed environment with less distractions, and are more focused on the music itself. When live, there is a large crowd that will be a distraction, along with a lot of lights and such that will make the performers less relaxed; it is a more energetic environment.  Secondly, there are no outside factors that will influence the way a song sounds. When one is hearing a song being played in a large room, things tend to sound different opposed to when the artists are in a closed room. There is also no screaming crowd, and one is also not seated far away from the performers.  When a song is being recorded, it is done in chunks. The whole band playing together is not recorded, but rather each of the individual instruments and voices are recorded separately, and later compiled together. When live, one hears all instruments playing together, and the sound of one instrument may interfere with the sound of another.  Another reason, live performances can only be done once, there are no \"do-overs\" in concerts. The artists have once chance to do their song, and a mistake is a mistake that will be heard. When in the studio, artists will have many chances to have \"do-overs\". The song people hear is the most perfect iteration, probably out of dozens of takes, just like with a film.  Finally, live music is raw, the song is not enhanced. In the studio, specialized software will be used to edit the way the song sounds (e.g. tuning, voice enhancements, et cetera). If a note is off key, it can be edited. Overall, enhancement software makes the song sound cleaner. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many possible reasons for this .  1. One of the main challenges for the vocalist in live performances is breath control especially if the song's lyrics are very continuous.This is beyond the control of audio engineers and a limitation which has to be accepted. 2. There are no second chances in live performances. A mistake made is a mistake heard.  3.  Adjusting volume levels of each channel for that particular song can be done after the recording or before the final mix(which we hear) in recording. In live performances however it has to be done during the song and each song has different level requirements. (A much tougher challenge)  4. If the concert venue is huge then the sound heard on stage (feedback) can be very different from the sound heard by the audience.  5. The performers in live concerts focus more on energy of the performance and hence suffer a little loss of perfection and quality. ",
