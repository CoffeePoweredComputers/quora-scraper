            "answer_text": "There are lots and lots and lots of parts and operations, and it\u2019s all done by hand. Nothing in it is all that expensive - wood, metal, leather, plastic - but that perfect, shiny, beautiful-sounding thing has been made much as it would have been a hundred years ago. There\u2019s not so much in an accordion that is amenable to mechanization, and there aren\u2019t enough of them sold to justify some grand robotics investment. A human being runs a bunch of conditioned wood through a jig to make little parts, a human being cuts and builds and sands the case and hand-glues hand-cut pieces of veneer onto it, a human being sits there bending hundreds of pieces of wire and assembling them into the bass machine, a human being cuts and shapes the reeds and pounds in their rivets, a human being prepares the reed blocks, a human being waxes in the reeds, a human being meticulously cuts the paper for the bellows and glues the hinges and does the little origami trick for the corners. Etc etc. Skilled humans doing very very particular tasks for many many hours is costly. Some of this stuff can be sped up with CNC routers, and of course there are power saws, and sanders, and planers, and drills. But what we think of as a decent-quality, wedding band accordion is pretty much a hand-made artifact. By the time the finished product is packaged and shipped and sold someplace where the retailer needs to make enough to stay in business, it ends up costing what it does. ",

            "answer_text": " With a better understanding of the process of making an accordion, one will probably believe that accordions are actually quite inexpensive for what you get. Imagine a process that involves 6000 parts and hundred of man hours to create the parts and assemble. It is only the fact that labor is cheap in places like China that the price is as low as it it today.
