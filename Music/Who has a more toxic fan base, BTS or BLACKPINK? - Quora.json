            "answer_text": "I am an ARMY so my answer may seem biased in some ways (the latter), but to show I want to be fairly balanced, I\u2019ll give an example of a toxic ARMY first:  This picture is a picture of a comment I commented on BTS\u2019 new song \u2018Dynamite\u2019, which I would appreciate if ARMYs would stream a little harder, but you don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t really enjoy it; just a reminder. I thought that the comment was fairly polite, and that it couldn\u2019t really offend anyone (just in case, I wrote down the fourth section though). Reading it right now, it could be slightly offending (mostly during number 3). To be honest, at first, I posted the comment without the \u2018(I half suspect that some of them are actually antis too who are trying to drop the image of ARMY)\u2019 part, because I thought that since there was no reason why I would really post anything this long to support and help streaming if I was trying to offend ARMYs. Right after I posted it though, since the section was at the beginning, I edited it in. (Approximately 30 seconds later). About four minutes later, I get a comment from this person who I am going to cut out for reasons of privacy (although you can\u2019t really get sued for posting an internet name).  Too which I was slightly offended, since I had edited it 30 seconds later, and this so called \u2018ARMY\u2019 comes along and suddenly tells me that I am not a true \u2018ARMY\u2019. I understood, although I had the feeling this fan was toxic, that some ARMYs are very sensitive during the first 24 hours of a comeback (and mainly since BlackPink\u2019s How You Like That broke a well deserved record), and posted this:  It was very wrong of me to assume that those ARMYs were young, and I should have been more considerate with my words and turned it into \u2018some immature ARMYs who I assume (and can be wrong) are young\u2019, but I was slightly pissed off and not in the mood to edit it. I thought that it was still fairly polite though, since I was still ready to understand her/him if she understood me; however, shortly after, she/he posted these two comments:  and  In the first comment, I was offended because I had edited it right after. I saw that there was a reason for her/his second sentence, since I assumed. I really didn\u2019t like her third sentence and her fifth sentence, because the ARMY fandom is my fandom and because , and because her/his writing style isn\u2019t the best. The last sentences, I am sorry of, since I assumed again (which is very wrong), but it also outraged me because you should be polite in all times (although I need to admit, I lose my temper sometimes, and you may find some comments of mine which can be toxic, its harder to be polite if you\u2019re online). The second comment, I was offended. Not because she called me a Blink, since many Blinks are actually nice and competitive but more respectful than this user, but because of the way she is talking lowly about Blinks, and the way she criticizes me for assuming while assuming that I am a Blink. Its like me being straight but someone telling me I am lesbian. (which isn\u2019t true because I\u2019m actually A-sexual, but that\u2019s not the point). It\u2019s not that someone necessarily hates the LGBTQ+ community when they are offended by being called lesbian. Someone straight will be automatically offended by being called some other sexuality just because of the fact that isn\u2019t true, and because their own sexuality isn\u2019t being respected (its really random, but a quick question I would appreciate being answered: I\u2019m assuming again, but why do some members of my fellow LGBTQ+ community think that being straight is offensive? It\u2019s still a sexuality to be respected. Just that a girl likes a boy doesn\u2019t mean that she is homophobic. It\u2019s just down right weird). It\u2019s kind of like that. I respect Blinks, but I like being an ARMY (sometimes). I\u2019m really sorry if that somehow offended someone. You can write in the comments below if you were offended, and why. Not to say that this is the majority, but this is still disgusting, fellow ARMYs. Well, since these type of comments give me traumatic (I\u2019m being dramatic, tell me if you were offended of me using trauma so easily in my sentence) responses and I need to show that I am an actual ARMY, this is the Blink part of toxicity. It aren\u2019t actually my pictures, because I don\u2019t really spend a lot of time with Blonks, and just spend time with Blinks who are encouraging in YouTube comments and everything, so I can\u2019t really post a specific example. It also means I have more pictures, but it doesn\u2019t mean that there are more Blinks that are toxic. (Okay, I actually think that I am having a little bit of a traumatic response, I need to apologize and be careful every god damn time (sorry if that offended anyone who is Christian, I\u2019m sure my religion teacher may have been offended9), which I should be, but its really sad that I\u2019m forced to be polite, you know? Okay that was random) Anyway, here are the examples:       That doesn\u2019t mean Blinks don\u2019t go along with ARMYs:  So\u2026 my final answer for this question is that for me, personally, who spends more time along toxic ARMYs than Blinks, it seems like ARMYs are more toxic (and hurtful for me), but for the whole fandom, it kind of seems like Blinks. Peace out! ",

            "answer_text": "I am both BLINK(BLACKPINK) and ARMY(BTS) here so this isn't going to be biased whatsoever. In my opinion, BLACKPINK's fandom is much more toxic. Even though I'm in the fandom, I don't actually do any of this stuff, I barely even post on social media about BLACKPINK. The first and last idol I posted was Jungwoo so\u2026 I'll give some reasons why. Some BLINK's think BLACKPINK is popular because of their talent, and will do anything to prove people wrongEven though I'm a BLINK here, I'm being truly honest. Yes, BLACKPINK has talent but the only reason why they're one of the top girl groups is because of YG Entertainment. I'll explain more in the last reason why.Nobody has any opinions about this fandom according to usAnything you do or say, us BLINK's will most definitely have an reaction. We do not accept anyone's opinion. You can say something like \u201cTWICE is better than BLACKPINK in my opinion\u201c and prepare to be attacked. We force our opinion on others whether they like it or not. It's simple, we think our opinions are better than yours.Other fandoms say the tiniest things, we reactIf you say the tiniest thing about your fandom being top and whatever like that, be prepared to go to war with BLINK's. We protect BLACPINK in every way, but damn, we are overbearing. Every where you turn there's a BLINK threatening you. I swear, I see these things and wonder why I'm still part of this fandom.We even have arguments in between our own fandomI'm pretty sure every fandom argues about something in their own fandom. And that's normal but, we take it to the next level. Arguments on how Jisoo should be main vocal vs. Ros\u00e8 being better than Jisoo. Jennie being a lazy idol vs. Lisa given no rap time because of Jennie. Lisa being overrated vs. Ros\u00e8is more talented than her. It's a bunch of stuff like comparing and bringing down other BLINK's in the process. It's a mess.We give BLACKPINK unecessary attention, and said otherwise, we attackI am continuing this from my first reason. Along with YG making them more popular than should be, they have to be one of the laziest idols when it comes to comebacks and releasing new stuff. They debuted in 2016 and that's been about 3 years in the business. And they have like 2 mini albums and 2 real albums both japanese and korean. And if you say any if that to a BLINK, we get angry and say that they deserves all the attention and that they're more talented than anyone else. Like seriously, Stray Kids released 6 albums in 2 years time. BTS released about 4 albums 3 years time. Like they're talented but they're hella lazy when it comes to releasing stuff. Listening to the same songs on the same album gets annoying. And I really hope they can release some actual good music in 2020 because right now, \u201cDon't Know What To Do\u201d is the only good song on \u201cKill This Love\u201d in my opinion.",
