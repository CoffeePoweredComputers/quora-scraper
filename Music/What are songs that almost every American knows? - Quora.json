            "answer_text": "Here are some songs (or types of songs) I know most of us Americans know, in general: Songs we learn in most schools and/or from parents/guardians like the ABC song and Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.Nursery rhymes and lullabies like Hot Crossed Buns and Brahms Lulluby.Most Amercian children grow up playing hand games or jump rope games and know the songs from those, like Miss Mary Mack, I Don\u2019t Wanna Go to Mexico, or Bubblegum Bubblegum in a Dish. I will admit though, I think more and more kids of the recent generations aren\u2019t so familiar with these.Classic Christmas tunes. Jingle Bells, Silent Night, Winter Wonderland, etc.We generally end up learning songs about America in school or just in our culture. The Star Spangled Banner, This Land is Your Land, God Bless America, God Bless the USA, America the Beautiful, My Country, Tis of Thee\u2026 there\u2019s a lot.Famous pop culture hits such as Don\u2019t Stop Believing, Bohemian Rhapsody, Take On Me, R.E.S.P.E.C.T., and Welcome to the Jungle.Songs commonly used for or just HEAVILY connected to specific memes like Never Gonna Give You Up, What Is Love, Blue (Da Ba Dee), and Bring Me Back to Life.Most of us know an entire horde of classical songs that constantly pop up in our American pop culture, such as Beethoven\u2019s 5th, Fur Elise, Love Theme from Romeo & Juliet, Vivaldi\u2019s Four Seasons (especially Spring and Winter), In The Hall of the Mountain King, or Mozart\u2019s Symphony #40 in G minor. Most of these are songs we can\u2019t always name on a day-to-day basis, but any American with a tv or computer can say they know all of those classical songs from movies, shows, games, cartoons, and other media.Classics like Turkey and the Straw, Do Your Ears Hang Low, The Entertainer, and Holiday For Strings, which are often featured in pop culture as well, and some are played out loud in neighborhoods on ice cream trucks.",

            "answer_text": "Few things in life are guaranteed to be 100%. Death and taxes are often mentioned. The third is I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor. If you are in a bar with a karaoke machine and drunk girls, you will hear this song when the girls are drunk enough. I guarantee it. Two or more girls will take the microphone and belt out this annoying song. They will, while singing, point at their boyfriends or male friends as if making some kind of profound statement. You know what I\u2019m talking about. You\u2019ve seen it. You may have been one of those girls. I Will Survive is the drunk girl anthem. ",
