Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in? Do you ever feel already buried deep six feet under? Screams but no one seems to hear a thing Do you know that there's still a chance for you 'Cause there's a spark in you? You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine Just own the night like the 4th of July 'Cause, baby, you're a firework Come on, show 'em what you're worth Make 'em go, \"Aah, aah, aah\" As you shoot across the sky-y-y Baby, you're a firework Come on, let your colours burst Make 'em go, \"Aah, aah, aah\" You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe\u2026 This is just a part of the whole song\u2026 Try it\u2026 It is really inspirational\u2026 ",
