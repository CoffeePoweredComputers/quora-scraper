Now, I am assuming that you mean on the radio, so without further ado, here are The 4 (and remember that these are all subjective!} You Light Up My Life-Debby Boone Quintessentially the singe-handedly the biggest one hit Pop wonder of all time! This song, sang by Pat Boone\u2019s daughter spent an astounding 10 Weeks at #1 back in 1977! The song sold well over a million copies, including the U.S. Even with all that, she never did have any other Pop Top 40 hits at all. Years later, she went on to have a successful Christian Music career instead!I Am Woman-Helen Ready Now (no pun intended) if there was a quintessential anthem for the women\u2019s movement, then this was it! While I do not recall when the last time that this song was on the radio, to the best of my knowledge, everyone still knows it!Y.M.C.A.-Village People OK, not nearly as lost as the rest of them, this caught on as a very successful disco song! This one also went platinum as well! They were actually sued by the organization of the same name for using it as a song, but was settled out of court with The band allowed to keep performing the song! But that in the future, nobody else could record a song using The Young Men\u2019s Christian Organizations acronym instead.Copacabana-Barry Manilow OK, this one not technically forgotten either, however who can can forget Lola at the Copa, Copacabana, the hottest spot north of Havana! While technically not even close to his biggest hit, it still did quite well on the charts and is still well known today!Well, while there are quite a few other too, I believe that these 4 songs round it all up quite good!

            "answer_text": "Funny you should ask this of me. I have been literally taping the 70\u2019s music channel on my TV for about the last day or so, waiting for them to play ONE song. They haven\u2019t played it yet, but I am hopeful. I fast forward through the artists I am not interested in like Elvis, Diana Ross, Rod Stewart, etc., although I do stop and listen to the gems like All I Know by Art Garfunkel (a Jimmy Webb penned tune), I Wou;dn\u2019t Want To Be Like You by The Alan Parsons Project, We Just Disagree by Dave Mason, and so many others. The 70\u2019s were the height of memorable music, IMO. Oh, yeah, the song I am waiting for them to play? Gypsy Woman by Brian Hyland, of course.  This is the only song of Brian\u2019s from the 70\u2019s that they will play, so it is like looking for a needle in a haystack, but I will keep waiting and hoping. ",
