            "answer_text": "Queen were all about harmonies. That was one of their big trademarks. When they harmonized together each one sang a different part of the harmony. People don\u2019t realize that Roger completely lost his falsetto in 1982, from that point on, Freddie did all of the high harmonies on the albums. High harmonies, such as the A5 harmonies on Princes Of The Universe was Freddie alone, Roger just could not do those high falsetto harmonies anymore at that time. Acappella groups uses the same concept. Brian most often sang the middle and low notes, Freddie did the high and lower notes and Roger the high notes. They had to blend their voices together. Since the other two were higher tenors, Freddie often sang the lower notes, because his voice had more resonance on the lower notes then the other two. Both Freddie and Roger had pretty good voices. Throughout their time together, Freddie has actually sang higher notes then Roger. Freddie\u2019s highest viable note ever recorded was F6 (there are higher notes but they are not viable). Roger\u2019s highest note ever recorded was E6. They actually had a very similar range. Roger was just more of lyric or leggiero tenor, and Freddie was more of dramatic, powerful lower tenor. Freddie would also sing high harmonies when Roger was singing lead, although it obviously did not happen that much. Here is Freddie singing above Roger during a performance of I am in Love With My Car:  Something interesting to note is that most people who perform Queen song tend to use two different vocalist. During Queen\u2019s live shows with Adam Lambert, Roger is actually the one who is singing most of the lower notes, since his voice became deeper and lower over the years. This is most apparent during Under Pressure, Roger sings David Bowie\u2019s baritone part and Adam Lambert sings Freddie\u2019s tenor parts. The same is true of Marc Martel, he has a female vocalist who helps on the lower parts of the songs. When David Bowie performed Under Pressure he used a female vocalist for Freddie\u2019s parts. When it comes to Queen\u2019s songs, people often struggle with the lower notes, because it is often high tenors who chooses to perform the songs. Freddie was able to perform lower, middle and higher notes with a similar or even resonance rare in contemporary singing. This is more of an skill that opera singers needs to perfect. Because Freddie was a more dramatic and powerful tenor, he used a lot of full chest voice, this can tire out your voice at times. Whenever they did a lot of touring Freddie\u2019s voice would become tired over time, that was when they would use Roger to fill in some of the high notes. A grueling touring schedule can take its toll, on a lead singer\u2019s voice. During live performances Freddie sang in chest voice 90% of the time, especially as Queen began to perform to larger audiences. That is a lot harsher on the vocal cords then using head voice or falsetto, it tires out the vocal cords. Freddie likely sang mostly in chest voice live because it sounds more powerful, and in order for him to hear himself above the band. There were no in ear monitors during this time. And Freddie always moved around on stage a lot, he was quite far from any monitors a lot of the time. It is well known that Roger is actually the one who sang the high note \u201dfor me\u201d during the operatic section of Bohemian Rhapsody. The note is a Bb5, here is Freddie singing that same note live:  Roger had an incredible, strong falsetto during his younger years. Men tend to lose this type of strong falsetto at around age 30. Roger lost his strong falsetto around 1979, and his full falsetto around 1982. You can clearly see here how strong Roger\u2019s falsetto was during most of the seventies, his falsetto was much stronger and more resonant then Freddie\u2019s falsetto, he over powers Freddie\u2019s softer falsetto completely:  Skip one year forward to 1979, and Roger had lost that strong falsetto:  The range for a dramatic tenor is around B2-B4. Dramatic tenors can sometimes sing lower notes that sounds very close to a baritone, because their voices are naturally deeper and heavier. But they usually shine in the middle register. Here is Freddie, singing an operatic duet with Montserrat Caballe, where he sings more in the middle and lower register, you can hear he is quite good at it:  Here is Freddie in a demo that he sent to Montserrat Caballe while they were recording. Freddie mimics Montserrat\u2019s soprano parts with his falsetto:   Singing is not just about hitting some high notes. There are thousands of singers that are able to hit high notes. For most of a song, a singer will likely be in their middle range. You accentuate some parts by going higher or lower. It is important to have a dynamic middle range. A lot of higher tenors does not always sound very dynamic in their middle register, they sometimes need high notes in order for their voices to shine, the opposite can be true for baritones. Someone who is a dramatic tenor has a voice that sits nicely in the middle, it is a voice that can sound good high or low notes. Opera singers work really hard to sound consistent on high and low notes. In a practical sense it is far more productive to be consistent over all of your registers. ",

            "answer_text": "\"Why did Roger Taylor of Queen harmonize for Freddie Mercury? Does that mean Freddie could not go high?\" Resonance! Try not to think of it so much as Roger Meddows Taylor doing something Freddie could not (Roger definitely CAN hit the very highest notes more reliably than Freddie). It's more like he had more capacity at the top of his range than the other guys did. His voice rang out better up there. While Roger certainly can hit higher notes than Freddie (that screaming high Bb perched on top of the giant harmonised \"me\" leading into the heavy section of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is surely the most well known example of Roger's '70s-style high falsetto notes which make you wonder whether a boot between the legs was required to reach) there's not actually much in it. Freddie and Roger had similar ranges but the harshness of Roger's voice acts similarly to distortion in that it added harmonics/overtones/fundamentals to the sound which Freddie's much cleaner tone did not (I have an unfounded suspicion that one of them produced mainly even-numbered harmonics and the other odd-numbered which helped their voices blend). Most people have difficultly making the words distinct as they approach the top of their range. This is partly due to the science of how sound works. In a choir setting you may have noticed that the sopranos sound a bit like they're not really singing words when they get up really high - we sometimes rely on the altos to provide those details. Roger's voice remains nice and clear even right up at the top. You can still make out the words he is singing. That's the real reason he's so noticeable on the very highest notes. Even when the other guys are signing with him their voices become less significant the higher the pitch becomes while Roger's voice continues to gain apparent loudness. The internet is full of a lot of crap about Freddie's range (claims of a 4-6 octave range and who knows, he may have used Vari-speed to reach some of them - it really doesn't matter whether he did or not. Vocal range is a bit like power levels in Dragonball Z) but that\u2019s a ridiculously high note in anyone\u2019s language. Freddie briefly hits the Ab just below that Bb in \"Somebody To Love\" but that's on an \"ooo\" sound (for reasons it is easier to sing higher if you use certain mouth shapes). That's pretty much Freddie's highest note. I think he gets up to an A in \"Hammer To Fall\" and \"Under Pressure\" too. It's \"ooo\" every time. That's what makes me sure that's pretty much his limit. That is really, really high. Nothing about Roger being able to sing even higher takes away from the ridiculousness of how high Freddie could sing without it even sounding all that high (until you go to try and sing it yourself of course). Roger's voice doesn't resonate as powerfully on the lower notes but it really cuts through the mix when he gets up high. His high notes sound high. Roger makes Freddie's voice seem low the same way Saturn is further away from us than Jupiter. Both were capable of some incredibly high notes. Roger just had a couple more usable notes up there than Freddie. PLEASE NOTE: If you have a technical correction please only post it in the comments if you aren\u2019t going to be rude to me (even if you are some great classically trained singer who knows her A6 from her A5. Thanks. You know who you are. You only made yourself look bad is all I\u2019m saying). Feedback is wanted. Insults, not so much. ",
