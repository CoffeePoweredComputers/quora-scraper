            "answer_text": "Obviously this depends on taste but I\u2019d say that SXSW probably has the best diversity of artists at all levels. As opposed to the other festivals you mentioned, SXSW happens over about five days across dozens of official and non-official venues around Austin. There are probably fewer big headlining acts (though there are usually a few big shows) but literally hundreds of smaller bands playing all kinds of venues. Many bands will also play multiple times so you have more than one chance to catch them. The big downside to SXSW is that you might not get in to see everything you want to see, unlike the main stage at one of the other big festivals that is big enough to accommodate the whole crowd. ",
