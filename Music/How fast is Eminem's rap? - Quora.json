            "answer_text": "Eminem has broken his Rap God syllable count record. Geez, he sounds like a broken record every time he breaks a record. (those of you that got that, good job). In January 2020 he released \u2018Music To Be Murdered By\u2019, and on it was a very impressive song called \u2018Godzilla\u2019, which featured Juice WRLD. In the final thirty seconds of the third verse, Eminem rapped 224 words (328 syllables) at 7.46 words per second (10.93 syllables per second). In Rap God (2013) Slim spits 97 words (6.46 words per second), which is incredible, but the speed has now been topped. ",
