            "answer_text": "\"Have asked lots of people, What does life mean to you?, Some I thought were fake, But for some I felt that they were true. Some said, to play it, a game, for some, the question was lame. Oxford says- its a state of being alive, But to know the actual meaning you need to go in deep and dive. Some think life is living for around 100 years, And for some just a moment which lasts till eternity. It is when the shackles of bondage are broken, Looks like to heaven you have found the token. Life is a journey with an unknown destination, It might be to attain ultimate salvation. My life was a bit different from the others, Thinking of my past, I go into a trance, To re-live it, I want another chance. Just have an experience of 21 years of life, But seen the deepest trenches and highest peaks, Sometimes myself did I vandalize, And opposite to which did I fantasize. Lived different roles in a very short time, Some unimportant and some quite prime. Now, it seems like I have ended a phase, For the people around me, I have lost the craze. Do not know what to do in the future, Heard from many that I still need a lot to mature. Every person who was present in any point of your life deserves a thanks, Either loved me or hated me, Will be, in my life like a golf tee.\" ",

            "answer_text": "Hmmm, There are so many things being played in my mind now. For me, life is wonderful, amazing, interesting and beautiful. However, life can be twisted, bad, and painful. Does that makes sense? Life is about looking for opportunities. Life is about fulfilling curiousity. Life is about learning new things. Life is about being kind to other people. Life is about helping each other. Life is about communicating towards one another. Life is about bring new to their family or new to the society. Life is about achieving success or accomplish something amazing. Life is also about failure and sadness. Life is about up and down too. Life is about the way we perceived love. Life itself is a beautiful thing. It depends on you to view the world. ",
