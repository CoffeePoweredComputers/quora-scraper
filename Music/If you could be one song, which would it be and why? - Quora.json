Have a look Sunlight comes creeping inIlluminates our skinWe watch the day go byStories of all we didIt made me think of youIt made me think of you Under a trillion starsWe danced on top of carsTook pictures of the stageSo far from where we areThey made me think of youThey made me think of you Oh lights go downIn the moment we're lost and foundI just wanna be by your sideIf these wings could flyFor the rest of our lives I'm in a foreign stateMy thoughts they slip awayMy words are leaving meThey caught an aeroplaneBecause I thought of youJust from the thought of you Oh lights go downIn the moment we're lost and foundI just wanna be by your sideIf these wings could flyOh damn these wallsIn the moment we're ten feet tallAnd how you told me after it allWe'd remember tonightFor the rest of our lives If these wings could fly Oh lights go downIn the moment we're lost and foundI just wanna be by your sideIf these wings could flyOh damn these wallsIn the moment we're ten feet tallAnd how you told me after it allWe'd remember tonightFor the rest of our lives ",
