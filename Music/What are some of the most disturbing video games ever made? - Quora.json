            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: the following game does not contain blood, gore, sex, jumpscares, ghosts or any other profanity. Actually, It is not strictly necessary to have the mentioned things to make something disturbing.  Bully/ Canis Canem Edit  Probably the boldest move from Rockstar Games to tackle the school system, bullying and society in general. This is probably one of the most controversial games ever created who got all the Soccer Moms, Karens and \u201clovely\u201d people like good ol\u2019 Jack Thompson a bit edgy. The game was released back in 2006 with several future ports and remasters, but seriously watered down thanks to controversies. The game was intended to be far more aggresive, by including: Blood, Bruises, foul language, being able to bully girls (you can do it via glitch), girls bullying each other like boys do and making Jimmy (the main character) an actual bully. Despite being tamed, fortunately the core message remained intact. Why is disturbing? 1- \u201cCanis canem edit\u201d: That phrase means \u201cdog eat dog\u201d and is basically the motto of this game, whose definition is: \u201cruthless and fierce competition\u201d. In Bullworth (the school where the game occurs) we have cliques and each clique fiercefully assert dominance on each other. The order: Jocks (the kings of the school)GreasersPreppies (Despite having money and pretty much controlling school with it, Greasers have an upper hand in hierarchy since they\u2019re far more savage and can beat most preppies in fights)Bullies (if it wasn\u2019t for Russel, the strongest student, bullies would be bullied by upper cliques. They\u2019re the scavengers)Non Clique/Regular studentsNerds (The guys with the best grades but at the very bottom of the hierarchy by being weak and overall extremely unpopular)Everyone picks on everyone, everyone is in a constant \u201ccompetitively aggresive\u201d state by crushing the weak students and humilliating others and the tormentor gains status by showing strengh and dominance over others. To take things farther, outside school, bullying is a big thing. We got people from the rich side of the town humilliating and mocking on blue collar workers and homeless people. We also got bullying between teachers with Mr Hattrick (Math) bullying on Mr Galloway (English) and even we got teachers blatantly promoting bullying like Mr Burton (Gym) The disturbing part? this is how real world works. We are constantly competing on each other, humans are in a constant state of conflict, humans are warmongers by nature. We need to compete, we need to crush and dominate on those who are weaker and those who will threaten our position, dominance will make people follow you, we need to prove we are superior than others. \u201cIt's America! We go in there with threats and bribes until we get what we want. If all else fails, we beat the crap out of everyone\u201d - Jimmy Hopkins.  2- Transgression is Problematic: People love to think that Jimmy Hopkins is some kind of White Knight that allows the player to insert themselves in a \u201crevenge of the nerds\u201d fantasy, by beating up Jocks and Cool Kids. The truth is\u2026 Jimmy is a victim from the begining to the end of the game. Not only because people pick on him, but for standing for himself and for those who can\u2019t stand for themselves. Jimmy gets in trouble for defending himself from bullies and Principal Crabblesnitch appoints that behavior as \u201cproblematic\u201d labeling him as a \u201cpugilistic\u201d I will talk about the Townies/Dropouts, the strongest clique and maybe the most interesting.  These ruthless misfits that dropped out school and some of them couldn\u2019t attend it, are actually a product of the system. They couldn\u2019t thrive in a system that didn\u2019t gave them any chance to improve and have a different mindset, they feel a deep hatred to a society who marginalized them and have a vendetta against those who can afford an education and the education that neglected them. Zoe, a Townie and one of Jimmy\u2019s girlfriends. Was sexually harassed by Mr Burton (Gym) She stood for herself and denounced him. What happened? she got expelled. The disturbing part? Don\u2019t you see the pattern here? In school when you defend yourself against a bully, you will get suspended. The system does not reward those who can stand for themselves. That is transgression and that is problematic. Clean your noses\u2026  Now leaving aside my \u201canti-system\u201d rant, there are some other things quite disturbing: 3- Everyone is on medication: There is a roaming animation in particular that shows both kids and adults taking pills. Also, most people in this game claim to be on medication and being on therapy. Since Bullworth is a small and conformist town, could be a reference on how people\u2019s mindset is conditionated. 4- Happy Volts Asylum: We are going to the dark corners of this game. This place is creepy as hell, you have to go there twice to rescue Mr Galloway and Johnny Vincent. To make things worst, people there are under inhuman treatment/experiments and you can hear screams from the interns. The patients are townies. 5- Mihailovich:  This guy is the \u201cIn and Out\u201d Motel owner. Happens that this guy is a serial killer who awaits for people to take a room or kidnaps people and takes them to one room to murder them. You can hear screams outside of the hotel at night time. What boggles me is the fact that Bullies and Greasers hangs in the hotel... NEAR a serial killer! The funny part? You can humilliate the serial killer and will run away like nothing. 6- Preppies are a bunch of Inbreds Preppies in this game are known for their incestuous practices. Actually Derby (preps leader) is betrothed with his cousin Pinky (one of your GFs) Tad Spencer, one of the preppies, claims to have webbed toes because he\u2019s inbred. He also has a brother with no chin in Happy Volts Asylum. 7- Speaking of Tad Spencer\u2026  The backstory of this guy is downright disturbing. He has a beyond abusive father that hits both him and his mother. He truly fears him and even claims that his father taught him the meaning of pain. His father once stabbed him with a fork after Tad made a birthday cake for him. He takes social status very seriously, a behavior mostly encouraged by his father, who tells him to take the leadership of the preppies clique by humilliating Derby, his leader. Some of his quotes: \u201cNow calm down, Dad. Calm down\u201d - (While wandering around)\u201cNo Daddy. Stop. Stop\u201d\u201cWhy Daddy? Why?\u201d\u201cI'm sorry, Daddy. I'm sorry.\u201d\u201cPlease, Daddy. Don't hit me anymore.\u201d\u201cI'll do better next time, Dad. I promise.\u201d\u201cDon't punish me, Daddy. Please.\u201d8- Eunice and Beatrice: Oh boy, the two \u201clovely\u201d ladies.  First we got Eunice, an umbearably ugly girl who is mercilessly bullied and is actually the first girl who can make out with. Self explanatory.  ____  By the other hand we got Beatrice. Another unattractive girl who is mercilessly bullied by Mandy the cheerleader and most girls and boys from school. People love to think that Beatrice is a noble damsel in distress who is tormented by cool kids and Mandy. Yes, Beatrice is a victim at certain extent, but she\u2019s just as nasty as Mandy. The problem? Her condition of unpopular girl makes her go under the radar, deceiving people in process. She\u2019s actually self entitled, has good grades but dumb in everything else, whinny and she\u2019s the most aggresive of the nerds alongside Donald and Thad (she\u2019s prone to pick on others and shove bullies until some of them smack her down) Mandy comes with straight humilliation while Beatrice is the manipulative one. Beatrice takes advantage of Jimmy by blackmailing him to tell other girls and authorities that he\u2019s a sexual pervert in order to make him retrieve her homework stolen from Mandy. She also manipulates him to get her confiscated diary because she wrote romantic suff between both and made him kiss her twice. The disturbing part? She has herpes, HERPES. and you have to kiss her TWICE! That\u2019s fucked up! (that image above does not show it since bully has both models, one for cutscenes and one for gameplay And the later one does not show it)  Thank god her portrait is not main storyline mission. 9- Gary Smith:  The main villain, This guy is a straight up sociopath and narcissist. Think on him as some kind of a Joker, he\u2019s an agent of chaos, loves to torture people (specially nerds) and manipulate cliques to instigate fights among them, for no apparent reason. He\u2019s medicated and his therapist (like other students) is affraid of him. He has a poor concept of what is right and what is wrong and plans to take school. When he achieves his goal, takes principal as a hostage and turns school into a battlefield, making people fight each other. The sole reason of being a sociopath is disturbing enough. He gets in your mind, manipulate others against you or each other, he is the epitome of psychological abuse. Traumas? abuse? Insecurities? he does what he does because he can. He\u2019s the ultimate definition of a bully. 10- Mr Burton:  Gym teacher and athlete in decadence in his 50\u2019s. The guy is ruthless towards students and promotes bullying because according to him \u201cit builds character\u201d This guy has a particular taste: smell girls\u2019s panties. There is a mission called \u201cPanty Raid\u201d where he tells Jimmy to sneak into girls dorm, take girls\u2019s panties and retrieve them to him. This guy also has a thing for teenage girls, there is a quote who implies that he is trying to get into Mandy. He also sexually harassed Zoe. I think we could call him \u201cpedophile\u201d. 11- Edna the cook lady  She has to be one of the most hideous characters of all the game. She is known for contaminating food, hunting stray cats and Ms Phillips\u2019s (Art and Photography) cats to serve them for lunch, serving rotten meat and being even uglier than Eunice. Keep reading\u2026 Edna has a crush on Dr Watts (Chemistry) and asks Jimmy to arrange a date and keep the other students away in order to not spoil the date. Edna drugs Dr Watts and drags him to a motel room. Edna is disturbing enough to give you \u201cheebie jeebies\u201d, but she gave Dr Watts a \u201cBiology lesson\u201d. She drugged and raped Dr Watts!!! WTF!!?? 12- The freakies You find them in the carnival, just take a look:  Skeleton man  Bearded Lady  Mermaid  Siamese Sisters (I\u2019m not going to add Lightning & Zeke because I don\u2019t want a BNBR for offending shorties)  Sorry for being too long \ud83d\ude05 EDIT: Thanks to Robert Burton for reminding me about the Freaks of the Carnival. Also, I have added another one. ",

            "answer_text": "By far the creepiest game that I\u2019ve ever experienced is Petscop.  I doubt you\u2019ve ever heard of it. And from looking at it, what could be so scary about it? It looks and sounds kinda cute, right?The thing is Petscop doesn\u2019t exist. Or rather, no one can play it, as it is unavailable to anybody (save for Paul). The company that made it, Garalina, also don\u2019t seem to exist. So if this game and game company don\u2019t exist, how do I know about it?  A few months ago a YouTube channel named \u2018Petscop\u2019 uploaded videos about the game, with someone named Paul playing them. He started recording and uploading them initially for a friend to prove to them that the game is real. At first the game seems like a normal PS1 video game for kids, just like you probably thought at first.  It starts off like Pok\u00e9mon, where you have to collect (or rather \u201ccatch\u201d) these creatures just known as pets or gifts. Sounds innocent, I know. Except the way you have to catch them requires Paul to be deceptive and con the pets so that he can catch them. Amber is caught because she thought she was jumping to safety. Randice was caught because they thought they would get rain water, and Wavey was caught after they spent all their rain water in a bucket meant for Randice. Okay, so it\u2019s subtly cruel and dark, not scary, so what\u2019s the big deal? Paul later has to use a cheat code he found with the game, which ends up putting him into what we later know as the Newmaker Plane.  The area is mostly this desolate grassy place with some buildings every now and then, prominently a windmill or a shed or Michael\u2019s grave.  Just from figuring out how old Michael was makes this seemingly child-friendly game much creepier. Also, the phrase \u2018Mike was a gift\u2019 questions the lack of regard the game has for children and pets; as an earlier sign stated, \u2018When you\u2019re choosing a pet, find somebody you like\u201d instead \u201cfind one that you like\u201d (which upon revisiting is what it changes to), as you\u2019d expect it to say. The entire game continues to blur the idea of pets and adopted kids with the neglect many fostered kids face, which becomes a key theme to the entire series. Yeah, I know it\u2019s not entirely creepy just yet, but I\u2019ll cover one more thing this \u201cgame\u201d has to offer out of the many theories and creepy moments the series has. One of the most widely accepted and popular theories among fans is the connection it has to Candace Newmaker. Now before anyone clicks on the link, I will warn you it is an extremely unpleasant story and you may find it quite disturbing. The game itself never makes any explicit references to the Newmaker incident, but there\u2019s enough of them to not call it a coincidence.As I\u2019ve already mentioned, the place Paul visits after the main area (the Gift Plane/Even Care) is the Newmaker Plane, which you will have spotted that connection already.   (The latter image says \u201cQUITTER\u2019S ROOM\u201d on each side; backwards on the player\u2019s side) (Again, discretion advised for the following paragraph) Now, if you didn\u2019t click the link or didn\u2019t already know about Candace Newmaker\u2019s tragic death, you may not understand the context of the text box. Just to summarise it shortly she was a girl adopted by Jean Newmaker at around 10; Candace had her name changed from Candace Tiara Elmore to Candace Elizabeth Newmaker; and the two weren\u2019t connecting very well. Jean found a supposed psychological treatment called \u201crebirthing\u201d where psychologists would cover Candace in a blanket and sit on top of her with their combined weight crushing her, waiting for Candace to fight her way out in order to be \u201crebirthed\u201d to her new mother so they can get attached easier. After fighting for around 40 minutes and Candace pleading for her life, the \u201cpsychologists\u201d calling her a \u201cquitter\u201d and telling her to \u201cdie then\u201d, she was eventually released and found turned blue, lying in her own vomit and brain dead. Candace Newmaker died the following day. So why would a gamemaker (revealed as Rainer later on, who eerily had some personal connection to Paul Christmas of 2000) make all these references to this tragic event? Well, as said before, Petscop sheds light on the neglect of children, prominently adopted children like Candace herself. The darker truth to all this is that stuff like this still happens. Many children are neglected all the time by parents and foster parents and in some extreme cases, this neglect results in death. The Candace Newmaker theory only scratches the surface of what is an even creepier game that has a real deep and personal connection to Paul himself the more he plays it, going so far as to actually censor some images out.  I highly recommend checking out the YouTube channel itself and the subreddit, which discusses theories around Petscop. Furthermore, I\u2019d recommend watching theories of the game on YouTube itself if you want to know more about Petscop. ",

Deus Ex: Mankind Divided.  Background The franchise\u2019s trope is that people can become augmented. In the originals, in the \u201890s, you were augmented with nanites, but the more recent games have been prequels, where you\u2019re basically wearing prosthetics that turn you into a superhuman, like the Million Dollar Man. Depending what augs you invest in (and you can eventually get them ALL), you can have essentially whatever superpower you like: you have metal claws that come out of your arms, you\u2019re invulnerable to bullets, invisible, stronger, faster-running, higher-jumping. You can fire things from your fists, you can affect people\u2019s minds through pheromones to get them to agree with you, you have x-ray vision, you can hack any computer or security system, and so on and so forth. You can get all of these abilities, and you start with a bunch of them. You\u2019re not just a superman. You are most of DC and Marvel's pantheon of superheroes and then some. But, because of something in a previous game that happened that caused augmented people (\u201caugs\u201d) to involuntarily kill people all over the world, augs in this world are seen as second-class citizens. Dangerous to \u201cnaturals\u201d. Scary, and \u201cless than human\u201d. They have to take expensive drugs just to keep their bodies working, but they can\u2019t get jobs. They are segregated and ghettoised.  Why it\u2019s disturbing Well\u2026 it\u2019s not. Initially. The game starts with a terrorist attack, apparently by augs, on a subway station. You try to help a little boy dig his mother out of the rubble. She\u2019s already dead. You make your way around the game hub of Prague, solving little subquests. It\u2019s cool, a sneak-\u2019em-up. You don\u2019t have to kill anyone (I haven\u2019t, yet), as you\u2019re ridiculously overpowered even in the early game, at high difficulty. You can go anywhere in the city: nothing can keep you out. But, to get around, there is a subway system. The carriages and the entry/exit passages are segregated. Naturals on one side, augs on the other. Naturals get the green sign, augs the red one.Naturals get three electronic turnstiles, augs get one manual one.Naturals get to walk in the open, augs are in some kind of confining cage.Naturals move in and out freely, while cops watch the Augs line, heaping insults on them as it moves slowly. But you have the right papers so can walk right past the line, and use the aug entrance just fine, no lining up.Naturals get to use the nearest part of the platform: augs are on the far end, having to walk past the naturals who talk about them and mock them.Naturals get to use the carriages at the front of the train, augs at the back.But you\u2026 you can use the naturals\u2019 entrance just fine. And you can get on the naturals\u2019 carriages. Nobody prevents you. But when you do so, in the cutscene as you ride it, a parent watches you worriedly, holding her child close. Are you one of the terrorists? And you know, you know, that with one keypress, you could fire out a whirlwind of bullets killing everyone in the carriage; that ability costs you just 2 \u201cpraxis points\u201d. So her fear is not unjustified, and you know it: less than 12 game-hours prior, you were lifting rubble off a mother like her, as a boy like him cried, as an aug like you had killed them. Everyone in that city knows it. And when you get out of the carriage, a cop gives you grief, demands to see your papers. They check out, but he still gives you grief, something like: I give you credit that you don\u2019t look stupid. So I can only assume you wanted to make a point. This is not the place. And he\u2019s right. People are scared. You\u2019re an aug. You could kill them. By being in their space, by violating their social rules, you\u2019re threatening them. He\u2019s right to give you shit about that. He doesn\u2019t even detain you - just checks your papers. He\u2019s doing his job. You hear that the papers they\u2019ve recovered from the bombing are giving them clues. Of course he\u2019s checking your papers. And if you take the natural\u2019s path out of the station, you\u2019ll get grief at the exit, again. Twice you get your papers checked, getting off the train and leaving the station. And you can\u2019t, really, argue against that. But\u2026 the segregation isn\u2019t right. You\u2019re not lesser. Those other augs, using the aug carriage. They\u2019re not lesser. They\u2019re people too. It\u2019s unjust. It\u2019s wrong. And that\u2019s when it gets disturbing. Because, that hassling. It eventually gets to you. Not in a big way. It\u2019s just\u2026 inconvenient. Even though he\u2019s just doing his job, you could kill that one guard, or knock him out, hide the body in a store-room\u2026 but still, every time you travel to a new location, there\u2019ll maybe be some other guard. You could get rid of them all, so that it\u2018d be just as fast and hassle-free for you to travel on the naturals\u2019 side, as on the augs\u2019 side. But there\u2019d still be that young mother, looking at you out of the side of her eye, casually interposing her body between her son and you, incase you explode in a fireball of death. At first, I did use the naturals\u2019 carriage. They were in the wrong. The segregation was wrong. But the cop was right. Who was I making a point to? To these cops? To the other passengers? To the un-thinking AI in my computer game? I\u2019ve always prided myself as being the one who would say \u201cno\u201d in the Milgram experiment. I often buck authority where I see it as immoral. But, eventually, I got bored of all the \u201cpapers, please\u201d nonsense, and I\u2019d avoid the subway as a means of transit. I\u2019d just walk, instead. That was mostly unconscious, but I eventually realized I was doing it. I\u2019d walk across the city, essentially self-segregating, to avoid the segregation. But there\u2019s a river, where the subway is the only way to cross, and for that I\u2019d use the segregated turnstile and carriage. It was a conscious choice, which meant accepting being treated as a second class citizen. Being mocked both openly and in whispers behind my back. But I rationalized it to myself. I had a job to do, and it\u2019s less hassle to not be the nail that sticks up. I\u2019m meant to be a stealth operative, I don\u2019t need to draw attention to myself. I\u2019m fighting the system in other ways. I don\u2019t need to upset people just to feel good about myself\u2026 and so on. Knowing that I was doing it, but seeing no faster way to move around the city and do what I needed to, I rationalized and internalized my character\u2019s place as a second-class being in this world. Because it meant less inconvenience. And then, just after I stepped onto a carriage, to a station I knew would be deserted, with no guards checking who stepped off from which carriage, I realized that I had still obediently walked the whole length of the platform, and boarded the augs\u2019 carriage. That\u2019s the most disturbing moment I have ever had in gaming. That\u2019s wonderfully, gloriously, deeply disturbing. That\u2019s the kind of morality exploration I\u2019ve been hoping for in gaming for decades. It\u2019s subtle, and so I\u2019ve been unable to explain to people why it was such a \u201cwow\u201d moment for me. I\u2019d walked into that situation with open, self-reflective eyes, thinking about my decisions and wondering what was morally best, and it had still caught me. Would I, in the beginnings of Nazi Germany, have stood up against the authorities as they began to segregate people? Would I, if I were Jewish, refused to have worn the star? Or would I have done what they told me, have gone along with everything, just because it was less inconvenient? I hope you, dear reader, can understand why I rank this game as the most disturbing I\u2019ve ever played. ",

            "answer_text": "Seeing as no one has mentioned it yet, I\u2019d say that a game that is morally disturbing is Grand Theft Auto. All the things that we do in GTA, we would be absolutely horrified to see it in real life. It\u2019s the type of stuff that drug cartels and groups like ISIS do. When I saw the Vegas shooting, and how he just shot into a crowd without any sort of significant motivation, no manifesto, no goal, almost as if he was bored and wanted to go out with a bang, I was reminded of the massacres we always participate in, in GTA. Those massacres are without any real motivation, they\u2019re just for fun. And I thought, in the in-game universe of GTA, technically the aftermath of our casual massacres would look just like it did with Vegas. Another recent event was when the Cleveland shooter shot that poor guy in the head on a facebook stream. It was horrifying, he just randomly and casually shot him in the head. It\u2019s just like GTA, where we just kill random pedestrians on the street. Of course GTA is virtual, but it does give us the capacity to commit actions, that would be considered atrocities in real life, in a virtually simulated environment. I find this incredibly interesting. It means that although we\u2019re horrified by such atrocities if they were to happen in real life, we\u2019re OK with simulating them in virtual environments, which means a part of us is fascinated, on some level, with such violence. Not only that, but it potentially puts us in the mindset of a real killer. From a GTA perspective, players usually treat the NPCs as nothing of note, they don\u2019t think much about the NPCs. Maybe this is the way that real killers view the world. Maybe that\u2019s how people like cartels soldiers can commit heinous acts without a care in the world. They don\u2019t feel any empathy for their victims in the same way that you don\u2019t feel anything when you put a bullet in a random NPC.  Rarely does a game allow you to use flamethrowers on a civilian populace, use mini guns to wreck utter carnage, cut people up with chainsaws, run over civilians, crush people with tanks, etc. GTA allows us to execute heinous acts on virtual people. You can simulate mass shootings, fly planes into buildings, etc. I love Grand Theft Auto, it\u2019s one of my favorite games and this element of disturbing morals is a big part of why I play. I have the freedom to help virtual people or I have the freedom to destroy them. It\u2019s a great platform to engage in role playing, GTA gives you the freedom to roleplay almost anything in a modern day setting, all you need is imagination.  ",

Dramatical Murder or DMMD for short (I don\u2019t know why; don\u2019t ask me). So this game is a visual novel. I think it was one of the very first ones to get popular in Japan, but don\u2019t quote me on that. I hate that I know so much about this crap. So basically, this game is set in the future. There are robots (see man-boy in white jacket with the yellow scarf), macho dudes (see dude in the grey jacket with the red bandana thing), brats (see dude with green and navy blue hat), cute robot animals (see floating/jumping puppy), and token blue haired main character (\u2026self explanatory lmao). Oh, and the dude in the red kimono, but I don\u2019t know what to totally classify him as other than a hairdresser. Sounds good so far, right? lol right. So blue haired dude (from here on out I\u2019m calling him Aoba because that\u2019s his stupid name) has this thing with his voice that he can control people with. People like his voice, even\u2026dudes. And he\u2019s got nerves in his hair so he doesn\u2019t cut it because cutting his hair, that has nerves in it, hurts him. Now dude in the red (Koujaku, because that\u2019s his stupid name) is Aoba\u2019s best friend and wants to cut his hair sometime but knows he can\u2019t because of the nerves in his hair. The adorable puppy (Ren, because that\u2019s HIS NAME) isn\u2019t a real puppy and is called something known as an \u201callmate\u201d and is Aoba\u2019s puppy; he keeps an eye on Aoba\u2019s headaches and blood pressure and all that grown up people stuff. The brat (Noiz because that\u2019s his name but not really but that\u2019s what he goes by because his birth name SUCKS) is some \u201ccool hacker dude\u201d with like twenty five piercings and can\u2019t feel pain for like half of the video game. Then the macho dude (Mink because that\u2019s his dumbass name) is like\u2026some gang leader\u2026or something\u2026 And then the robot (Clear because why would his name be something normal) thinks Aoba is his master because he heard him singing one time or something. I\u2019m honestly trying to explain this the nicest way I can because this game is\u2026something else. This game isn\u2019t just a Japanese visual novel, no, no. It\u2019s a BOY LOVE VISUAL NOVEL. Oh, but that doesn\u2019t sound bad, right? Right? WRONG.  Enter these two d-bags, Virus (left) and Trip (right) because of course they have some of the stupidest names known to video game mankind. Virus was my favourite before I found out how much of a d-bag he and his \u201cfriend\u201d are. They\u2019re both messed up in the brain because of some experimentation when they were children and are attracted to Aoba for some messed up reason. Do you see where I\u2019m heading yet? No? Great. After a bunch of crap goes down and you make it through all the other guys\u2019 routes (including Ren\u2019s because AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH), Ren gets a \u201cbad\u201d ending or something because something happened between him and Aoba. So Aoba ends up getting kidnapped by Virus and Trip and basically\u2026 They hold him hostage. As a slave. But not just any type of slave. A sex slave. Basically, there\u2019s not enough messed up crap that goes down in everyone else\u2019s routes to add up to equal to the stuff that they make him do. They both have allmate\u2019s of their own (like everyone else; Mink has a cockatoo; Koujaku has a swift, a type of bird; Noiz has a bunny; Clear doesn\u2019t have one). Virus has a life sized anaconda and Trip has a life sized lion. I\u2019m not going to go into specifics, but remember how I said that Aoba is Virus and Trip\u2019s sex slave? Um, yeah. Try or don\u2019t try to put that math together. Mink is also held to a really shitty stereotype and it sucks. It really sucks. If he didn\u2019t have that stereotype pushed onto him, he\u2019d probably be a decent and more likeable character. If you wanna do your own research on this game, tread carefully because you\u2019re probably gonna either need to cry in the corner of the shower for three hours or stare at the ceiling all night when trying to sleep. There are playthroughs on YouTube. Oh, and there\u2019s more than one game. And they made it into an anime. I feel like crying now after typing this all out and trying not to get into too much of a graphic detail. Excuse me while I scream into oblivion. ",

            "answer_text": "Weird Dreams on the Amiga. Not a particularly disturbing (or good) game as released. But - its original plot was so upsetting that it had to be changed before release.  The original plot? You are having surgery and are placed under general anesthetic. However, you find yourself having nightmares. If things go too wrong in the nightmare, your heart rate will speed up, overcome the anesthesia, and you will wake up..  \u2026 and get to experience surgery while awake. You can probably guess why that had to be changed. It didn\u2019t help that failed anesthesia was actually an issue in real hospitals at the time (which is probably what inspired the plot). The changed plot fudged things somewhat by saying you were in hospital having an alien spore cut out of your brain, and that was why it was giving you nightmares. The game over screen showed the scene above, but with the EEG flatlining indicating you had died - whereas the original one showed one of the surgeons lowering a scalpel towards you. So death was the less upsetting ending. But, with the extra attention paid to this question, I\u2019ve been thinking.. does disturbing have to mean scary? Well, if it does for you, you can stop reading here, but there were one or two games which I found very unsettling but in a positive way.  At first glance this game is a simple physics toy. You drag fire around on the end of the mouse, and you can create items to burn which react to being burned in different ways. When you burn them, you get coins with which you can buy other things to burn. You gradually start to get missions and combo puzzles to complete. Where things start to get weird is when you start getting contacts from other characters, and suddenly realize that this physics toy has an entire world and setting. It\u2019s been snowing for as long as anyone can remember, so now, all that everyone is told to do is to stay warm by gradually burning everything available. That\u2019s kind of creepy to start with, but it gets more positively disturbing when you complete the main part of the game.. and at that point the fireplace breaks apart and the game turns into a point and click adventure in which you can walk around the world that you were previously only hearing about. Amongst other things, you can meet the mailman. Yea, the mailman who was delivering all the items you ordered with the game coins. He dropped them off to you without you ever turning around, and watched as you threw each one in the fire.. Second up in this category:  So, this is a rather odd game about creativity. The game opens with the game\u2019s author - who addresses you by his real name, Davey, throughout - claiming that it\u2019s a collection of games written by a friend of his whose games he admired. As you pass through the games, they get increasingly odd, the commentary gets more and more distant, and there\u2019s gradually evidence of the friend - Coda - having some kind of breakdown which was showing up in the games. And then you get to the final game and it has an insulting message from Coda to Davey. Coda specifically told him not to share his games with others. The games you\u2019ve been playing have been patched to support Davey\u2019s narrative about Coda. Coda never felt half the things Davey claimed he did; all of those have been retrofitted onto the games. Davey has been living his second-hand creativity through Coda. Sounds pretty bad, but then there\u2019s the final level, and that\u2019s where it feels positive. It\u2019s one of the most beautiful levels in the game, and the ending is an interesting twist on something that happened earlier. But.. it\u2019s still a level you\u2019re walking around. And Coda clearly, on the previous level, told Davey to get stuffed. Which means that Coda didn\u2019t make that level, Davey did. Davey\u2019s voice sounds really uncertain all the way through it, but it implies he\u2019s finally trusting his own creativity and just learning from the stuff Coda did, rather than trying to ride on it.

            "answer_text": "Lisa the Painful RPG The game follows Brad Armstrong who lives with his friends in a post-apocalyptic society of Olathe after a mysterious white flash has killed every human female in Olathe during this time Brad stumbles upon a baby in which Brad brings back to his friends and in turn, they find out the baby is a girl. Brad\u2019s friends suggest that they hand the baby over to Rando a known Warlord with an Army as they are better equipped to handle humanity\u2019s last hope but Brad ignores this idea decides to raise her in secret to make up for troubled past and make sure she receives no harm and the baby girl is named Buddy. But when Brad is out gathering supplies and upon returning home he finds his house raided and his friends Cheeks dying and his other 2 friends nowhere insight Cheeks informs Brad that the secret is out Buddy has been kidnapped and setting off the events of Lisa the painful RPG This game does not hold back it\u2019s not afraid to kick you in the teeth and leaves a bitter taste in your mouth with heavy choices like would let of your party members get taken away or have all your items taken away or would let a party member be permanently killed or have your arm chopped off reducing your stats and taking various skills. These are just some of the early game choices that you can across. Everyone in your party is expendable your party members can be killed at a moments notice ranging from the Russian roulette minigame where you can earn money but you risk your party member\u2019s life to earn it or a certain enemy used an instant kill move on them or maybe you chose that option during a story event like I said you can easily replace party members but don\u2019t forget it was by your hand that ended your party member\u2019s life. Finally, in my opinion, the most disturbing part of the game is Joy Joy is a drug that looks like a little blue pill that makes you feel like nothing Joy is highly addictive and just a few doses will slowly mutate you into a body horror known as a Joy Mutant a process that slowly drives the addict insane. The Joy mutants of Olathe are highly hostile and are known to massacre groups of men and are known to have a taste for human flesh. ",

            "answer_text": "I believed that most of the most disturbing games has been mentioned by other answers, so I will just answer another game that hasn\u2019t been mentioned. Danganronpa series. Warning! Contains spoilers ahead! Danganronpa - Wikipedia     Basically, the story takes place in an academy for talented high school students, where they got trapped and are forced to kill each other without getting caught in order to escape from that place. So, the game basically lets you control one of them, interact with other students and make friends with them, and if there\u2019s a murder happening, you will be investigating to get clues, finding out who is the murderer. If you failed to find the real culprit, all the others besides the culprit will be sentenced to death. Disturbing? It\u2019s already disturbing when you had to see your classmates having to resort to murder just to get out, when the outside world is not a paradise as well. And when its approaching the end, you will have to figure out the whole mystery of why your classmates and yourself got trapped in the first place, and who is the mastermind. Needless to say, the mastermind is actually one of your own classmates. Your memories get messed up too, so badly that you don\u2019t even know what is the truth anymore. Even with each murder cases, you don\u2019t really know who\u2019s the real culprit until the last minute, which is always a huge plot twist to the players. And the latest game installment, Danganronpa V3 is much more twisted. They are forced to murder just because there are people who wanted to watch this, like watching a reality TV show. Even their whole existence and characteristics are molded by the mastermind. Their punishment (death sentence) to the murderers are so brutal that if they used red as their blood color, no one can stomach them. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A I will try to give as good a description as possible without spoiling anything since I suspect that it would ruin some of the games if you know what is coming. Manhunt  I remember when this game came out and had parents the world over fearing for the souls of their children. You play as a man saved from death row to take part in the making of a violent snuff film. It had some extremely graphic and violent gameplay. Condemned: Criminal Origins  You play as a detective investigating a serial killer in the midst's of a violent crime epidemic. This game has some very visceral and graphic first person combat. Combine that with some creepy supernatural elements and you have one hell of a disturbing game. Heavy Rain  While silly some of the times there are tons of disturbing moments in this game including torture scenes and almost falling victim to several serial killers. Telltales Games: The Walking Dead  A great game that uses difficult choices and limited time to force you to make some of the most gut wrenching decisions I have ever had to make in a game. Amnesia: The Dark Decent  One of the best modern horror games available. This game and it\u2019s sequel understand how to make you truly terrified. A clever first person survival horror puzzle game. Great use of sanity and the Lovecraft Universe. Spec Ops the Line  Based on Joseph Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness this game starts off as your typical shooter fare before spiralling down into on of the most disturbing and haunting games I have ever played. Silent Hill 2  You play as James Sunderland who goes to the titular Silent Hill looking for his wife. The Silent Hill series has always been scary but the way that the visual design and James story are so beautifully intertwined are truly a sight to behold. Eternal Darkness  Similar themes to Amnesia but it took things to a whole new level by messing around with you. It would pretend to be deleting your save file or it would adjust the volume on the television. This War of Mine  This base management game is based on the Siege of Sarajevo and focuses on the civilian side of an armed conflict. The disturbing aspect comes from the difficult decisions that the game forces on you constantly. It is one of the most depressing games that I have ever played. Alien Isolation  Play as Ellen Ripley\u2019s daughter investigating what happened to her mother while trying to avoid the titular Alien. This games has great A.I for the Alien and some of the best sound design you will find in gaming. It also has Oculus Rift support if you are not too fond of your underpants. Among the Sleep  This is little first person exploration game is played from the view of a toddler and is a really haunting experience. The Binding of Isaac  Playing as a small child you get to deal with some crazy religious themes and the rogue like gameplay makes it just that little more terrifying. A very rewarding experience if you can get to the end of the game. Irisu Syndrome  A weird and difficult freeware puzzle game that quickly goes insane. A lot of the backstory is hidden in .txt files that are in the install folder. You can download the game here \u3044\u308a\u3059\u75c7\u5019\u7fa4!\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u60c5\u5831 : Vector \u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u3092\u63a2\u3059\uff01 Fan-based Translation is here IrisuSyndromeENv2.03.zip Tomb Raider (2013)  While not as obviously disturbing as some of the other games on my list I found the abuse and suffering that Lara goes through in this game very off putting. The way that she is beaten and impaled and generally abused just never sat well with me. Honourable mentions (I have not played these yet but hear that they are good) SOMA INSIDE The Last of Us ",

            "answer_text": "Well, let\u2019s see\u2026 (Note: spoilers for the selected game and notifying that I\u2019ve crossed 2 million views, which I see as an absolute win! So, my greatest gratitude). Without further ado, here\u2019s my pick for one of the most disturbing video games ever made: Call of Duty: World at War.  Now yes, Call of Duty has brushed with disturbing moments with its campaigns (No Russian, anyone?), but as a whole package, World at War is an undisputedly unsettling demon of a video game. The backstory for the Nazi Zombies mode, set to blast off above and beyond with its later sequel in Black Ops, is brimming with disturbing material, too. But to keep it short(er), I\u2019ll focus on the game\u2019s main campaign. And quite honestly, where do I even begin?  https://youtu.be/6bcsXeuK8kk The link above is to the game\u2019s main menu theme. The title is \u201cBraff Soldat.\u201d Brave Soldier. Here are the lyrics: Braff Soldat. (Brave Soldier) Braff Soldat. (Brave Soldier) Stirb mit mir. (Die with me) Stirb mit mir. (Die with me) Stirb mit mir. (Die with me) Braff Soldat. (Brave Soldier) Hier Nacht (Here tonight). The lyrics are underscored by some of the hauntingly unsettling vocals and almost pained wailing, letting you know from the outset that this game\u2026 isn\u2019t what you think it might be. The soundtrack for this game is incredible as well. Not one track feels triumphant or empowering (save for arguably the Soviet theme that plays as you get to the very top of the Reichstag). Every track has a underlying link to tragedy, with the Black Cats theme especially being one of the most heart-pounding soundtracks in a video game. The music accentuates the fast-paced gameplay and adds another layer to the horrors of war that the game wishes to portray. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 World at War\u2019s campaign\u2019s greatest strength is its utterly horrible and unflinching resolve to portray the events of World War 2 with no restraints. Treyarch could not care less about any gamer\u2019s feelings (something Sledgehammer conveniently forgot to do with their own WW2 instalment) with its depiction of the Second World War.  You ever heard of an author called Tim O\u2019Brien? He\u2019s widely known for a book called The Things They Carried. I\u2019ll share with you an immensely important quote that underlines why World at War\u2019s ability to be unapologetic in its depiction of the most infamous conflict in our history is so disturbingly powerful. Here\u2019s the quote: \u201cA true war story is never moral. It does not instruct, nor encourage virtue, nor suggest models of proper human behaviour, nor restrain men from doing the things men have always done. If a story seems moral, do not believe it. If at the end of a war story you feel uplifted, or if you feel that some small bit of rectitude has been salvaged, then you have been made the victim of a very old and terrible lie. There is no rectitude whatsoever. There is no virtue. As a first rule of thumb, therefore, you can tell a true war story by its absolute and uncompromising allegiance to obscenity and evil.\u201d When a game developer, author or film director wants to make a story surrounding war, this means they should have no reservations about what they\u2019re trying to depict. If you\u2019re going to tell a war story, you need the guts to portray it without any obstruction from morality or virtue. Both of these qualities are absent in war. Obviously, the quote above doesn\u2019t apply to every war story, fiction or non, and it is arguable I\u2019m not using it in the correct context, but my justification for this quotes inclusion is to highlight the difference between what feels more authentic and what feels more Hollywood.  The greatest flaw with Call of Duty: WWII\u2019s storyline is its inability to be absolute and uncompromising in its allegiance to obscenity and evil. Yes, I thought Daniels was a decent protagonist. I thought his dynamics with his squadmates, notably Zussman, Pierson and Turner, was tangible. Yes, there was strong violence and depictions of war crimes. But the setting of Americans fighting against the Germans is just so generic. It\u2019s been done to death in film and gaming. The Second World War is infamous in its scope as well as its brutality. Nearly every country in the world was involved in some fashion. This game\u2019s storyline is too binary in its depiction of the Americans and its allies as the force of good versus the Germans as the absolute evil. The censorship of the swastika (save for occasional inclusions) is what bugs me the most. Yes, it\u2019s controversial, but it\u2019s historically accurate and should be treated as such. The writers behind WWII were too afraid (owing to the real world socio-political climate of everyone being a little bitch) to depict the controversies that are typical and integral to the Second World War.  Conversely, such real world worries were toned down in 2008. World at War\u2019s tone throughout the game is significantly serious. The light-heartedness and comic relief as shown in WWII is ditched in favour of driving home a dark and uncomfortable atmosphere. WWII\u2019s campaign, aside from giving us the traditional and annoyingly exaggerated Call of Duty action flair the series is known for (like with the Panzerzug train wreck that took 30 seconds to finally stop crashing), is safe, upbeat and positive. That\u2019s good to keep up morale, cracking wise and making the best out of an otherwise depressingly desperate situation. But it doesn\u2019t feel as authentic as it could have been. I feel like I\u2019m playing a glorified shoot-\u2019em-up that makes you feel \u2018happy\u2019 about being a soldier on the front lines of the most horrifying war ever. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 So, to further illustrate why World at War is worthy of being recognised for the disturbing content it depicts, I\u2019ll outline more specific examples. The campaign shifts between two fronts and two perspectives. You have Pvt. Miller in the Marine Corps fighting against the Imperial Japanese in the Pacific Theatre. Then there is Dimitri Petrenko, fighting alongside Viktor Reznov and the Red Army as they push from Stalingrad to the top of the Reichstag on the Eastern Front. The most noticeable quality expressive of the game\u2019s unsettling nature is the graphic violence.    Even for 2008, it\u2019s disgustingly visceral. There is a variety of weapons in the game which allows for this mechanic (\u2018gibbing\u2019) to occur quite frequently, namely the MG42, PTRS-41, M1987 Trench Gun, Type 91, Panzerschreck, and mortars. Guns that blast off an arm or even both legs of an enemy soldier sends him on his back, clutching at the lost limb in shrieking agony. Molotov\u2019s and flamethrowers make the enemy NPCs scream and howl in piercingly unnerving yells as their skin ignites and their flesh is roasted. It enhances the experience because it unsettles the player, and does not feel exaggerated or gratuitous because it is very much in line with World at War\u2019s atmosphere.  Driving around in a tank on the level Blood and Iron, for instance, allows a play to crush Germans beneath their treads, and the sickening crunches of bones being grounded to power is awful. The horror doesn\u2019t stop there. It extends to the unique encounters in the gameplay and storylines.  For example, with the Japanese, it would very boring if you ran through each mission and just shot at them hiding in cover. But they use the locations and tactics of the time to create equally interesting and brutal gameplay. They don\u2019t just move forward and shoot from behind cover. They sprint forward with a cry of \u201cTENNOHAIKA BANZAIIIII!\u201d (May the Emperor live for ten thousand years!) and try to impale you with their bayonets. They kamikaze their planes into warships, play dead, set traps for ambushes (which an unsuspecting Marine can\u2019t counter if they\u2019re caught), rise out of the grass wearing ghillie suits, pop up from spider holes and snipe from atop trees. These twists and turns serving to surprise the player adds to the authenticity that the Japanese were efficient and ruthless, showing no mercy in their attempts to outsmart the Americans. And the Marines aren\u2019t shying away from relishing in their small victories. A fellow Marine called Polonsky shouts \u201cHell yeah! Burn, ya little bastards!\u201d when clearing out a bunker, Sergeant Sullivan orders you to \u201cGet on those MGs and tear them up!\u201d, and a random Marine in the first level repeatedly shoots a Japanese officer in the chest, shouting \u201cYou like that, you piece of shit?!\u201d On the other side with the Eastern Front, there is more emphasis on the story and characters, and how they are influenced by the same horrors of war that the game wishes to share with you. Petrenko starts at a fountain in Red Square, just recovering from a bloody massacre of dozens of his comrades.  The German soldier above then shoots a couple of survivors in cold blood, and as you crawl around with Reznov, the blood of each man is plastered across the ground and the walls as they lay face down on the concrete or stare at the sky with empty eyes. Then, as we progress further into the heart of Germany, the plot thickens. The player is able to imagine and experience what fighting on those fronts with those soldiers would be like. You dive deep into the Russian\u2019s perspective of the war and the Germans. It\u2019s nothing short of vengeful and barbaric. Reznov: Dimitri? Finish those rats! Hahaha, once again, you cheat death. Our tanks are ready to smash this line and\u2026 CHERNOV! I\u2019m not hearing gunshots. Chernov: There is no point, Sergeant. They\u2019re already bleeding to death. Reznov: Then maybe our friend will help them bleed faster. (Their Land, Their Blood) Moments like these show another one of the game\u2019s strengths in its disturbing content: objectivity. The game does not romanticise the war. It doesn\u2019t really matter if you root for the Soviets or the Americans, all the game wants to achieve is the depiction of these battles in the most grounded and brutal way it can. Every side is neither absolutely good or bad. The Americans and Japanese are equal in their brutal tactics on one another and the Soviets and Germans are as merciless as they can be with their atrocities. Reznov and the other Russians get more and more bloodthirsty as you progress further into the heart of Germany. Soldiers like Chernov wonder if all this conflict and slaughter is worth it. It progresses to infighting in some instances:  In the level Eviction, Dimitri and Reznov make to move out of a building where they come across a German soldier on his knees pleading for mercy. This is the dialogue from his comrades: \u201cHe wants mercy!\u201d \u201cYou do not (slaps German) DESERVE mercy!\u201d \u201cWhat mercy did you show to our people?!\u201d \u201cTime to die!\u201d \u201cWait, wait! He may help us -\u201d \u201c\u2019Help\u2019 us?! He can DIE for us!\u201d (Shoots German) You as the player understand that you are fighting to end the Nazi\u2019s regime and end the war, but it doesn\u2019t excuse what the Soviets did to achieve that. Murdering surrendered soldiers in cold blood, marching Wehrmacht to a firing line to be executed, it\u2019s awful. This gives the story on the Eastern Front a dramatic dimension to it, of how war reduces us to our basest senses. Reznov is proof of that. Reznov: (to Chernov) What do you think will lead us home? (Snatches diary) Writing about this war or fighting it?! (Pulls up Chernov and slaps his diary back) No one will ever read this! If you lack the stomach to kill for your country, at least show me that you\u2019re willing to die for it!\u201d (Gives Chernov the Soviet flag) (Heart of the Reich) Then later in the same level, as you get to the entrance of the Reichstag, Chernov is burned alive by a German flamethrower, and Reznov recovers his diary. \u201cDimitri! Someone should read this\u2026\u201d  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 And after you\u2019ve planted the Soviet flag atop the Reichstag, after all of the depraved and depressing carnage you\u2019ve slogged through, you are shown footage in an epilogue of sorts. It depicts the readying and deployment of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to end the war in the Pacific Theatre. Harry Truman: General Eisenhower informs me that the forces of Germany have surrendered to the United Nations. The victory won in the West must now be won in the East. Afterwards, we see General MacArthur address the representatives present to the Japanese\u2019s declaration of surrender, where excerpts from his speech are given: General MacArthur: We are gathered here, representatives of the major warring powers, to conclude a solemn agreement, whereby peace may be restored. It is my earnest hope, and indeed the hope of all mankind, that from this solemn occasion, a better world shall emerge out of the blood and carnage of the past. A world founded upon faith and understanding, of man and the fulfilment of his most cherished wish, of freedom, tolerance and justice. Then the game reminds you what it was all about. \u201c60 million lives were lost as a result of World War II. It was the most destructive and deadly conflict in human history.\u201d Call of Duty: WWII made the mistake of showing this message at the beginning, where its power is given greater strength when placed at the end. It encourages you to reflect. One tenth of those casualties can be attributed to the Jewish population killed in the Holocaust, pushing nearly a third if we include all the other minorities. This gives games set in historical periods as infamous as this an edge because it happened in our lifetime, and reshaped the political, technological, social, geographical and ideological landscape of today. I don\u2019t feel awesome or proud when playing the campaign. I feel\u2026 uncomfortable. Conflicted. It\u2019s morally corrupt. I\u2019m grateful that such a game like World at War exists, because it serves as a dedication to all those lives lost for the preservation of the liberties we take for granted nearly 75 years later. We use history and conflicts like World War 2 to look to the past in order to act on things in the present to make a better future for the next generation.  Does this mean the game isn\u2019t fun to play? Of course not! That\u2019s where I derive the enjoyment from in the campaign. I take the campaign\u2019s subject matter seriously and the game doesn\u2019t insult my intelligence. In its objective, honest and authentic depiction of the call to duty these soldiers had to make, World at War\u2019s story feels that much more compelling than most other shooters and World War 2 games. It also harkens back to when Call of Duty had soul, no franchise fatigue in sight, and revelling in its rise to power. Yet, in my analysis of its absolute and uncompromising allegiance to obscenity and evil, World at War\u2019s is one of the most disturbing games you will ever lay your hands on. Peace and Love. A short life and a merry one. ",

            "answer_text": "In the deep, dark recesses of indie gore games, there\u2019s one that dials the horror up so far it doesn\u2019t even need audio. The saving grace is that it\u2019s so obscure and unknown that few, if any people have played it. Word of warning: it\u2019s strictly for adults, very amateurish in its production, and extremely gruesome. There are major spoilers ahead. I\u2019m going to skip over all the horrible gore, because that\u2019s not even 20% of what makes this game disturbing. I really, absolutely, definitely do not recommend playing this game unless if you are dead certain on not sleeping for the next week. The content warnings alone should make this game Adults Only and A Really Bad Idea For A Relaxing Weekend. No seriously, run away. Now. Only the insane shall continue on.  Demonophobia  Enter Sakuri. You have no idea what she\u2019s doing in this weird stony corridor. She doesn\u2019t either. Hell, there\u2019s so little explanation, you as the player will have to mash keys until you figure out her basic commands - move, crouch, use/pick up, sprint. Though that last one is very short-lived; Sakuri certainly didn\u2019t have good grades in P.E. Yes, there\u2019s also no audio, not even sound effects. On one hand you\u2019ll be glad for it. On the other, that means no audio feedback, which means that things become that much more unknowable and creepy. You\u2019ll notice that there\u2019s no weapon. She can\u2019t throw any punches. There\u2019s not even an examine. But there certainly are enemies and traps, many instantly lethal. When you die, you can press R to respawn. Good, at least the game tells you that. Each level gets progressively creepier. The enemies are already disturbing, the traps ever more lethal and gory, the bosses increasingly terrifying.  No seriously, this is tame compared to the later ones. And they match up to certain themes, like the Seven Deadly Sins. Early on, someone gives pity on this poor soul and comes in to advise and aid her. Enter Ritz, the floating, ominous spirit thing who at least doesn\u2019t look like animated, jagged flesh like all the other creatures.  Through the game, you die. A lot. It\u2019s a level memorization game where Sakuri\u2019s options are to run or hide from enemies. With Ritz\u2019s help, she can find certain objects in each level that let her defeat the boss of the floor instead of running away like the previous two. The only thing getting Sakuri through Hell is Ritz\u2019s words of \u201cencouragement\u201d and the promise of escape. Ritz of course is pulling a fast one. He\u2019s using Sakuri to get past the guardians and leaving this place by sacrificing her. After a gauntlet of some truly disturbing levels, including one where her house and family have been warped into Hell and assimilated into its insanity, she\u2019s had it. Doing the impossible, she destroys Ritz. In his last dying breaths, he reveals that no one in Hell can die or escape. Not even him. He was acting on delusions, hoping that doing something so cruel could get him out. Maybe if the universe ended they\u2019d be released, he ponders. As he disappears from view, memories start flooding into Sakuri\u2019s mind, ones that Ritz had been blocking with his magic. It turns out that each time that \u201cR\u201d button was pushed, Ritz had painstakingly put the remains of Sakuri back together. Making her forget about her deaths was his salvation to her. And now that she\u2019d rejected it?  The final lines of the game: I don\u2019t know how long I have been here. Where on earth is this? Why am I in this sort of place?! Who\u2019s there? You, over here, who are you? No need to fear\u2026 I want to save you. It\u2019s not just the body horror. It\u2019s not just the eternity of damnation. It\u2019s the hopelessness, the slide into insanity. You\u2019re there on the precipice and the end harkens the moment you fall off. Your imagination can do the rest. And when you realize that the ever-observant shadows in the background quite possibly represents us, the players? That we are the ones responsible for the rules of this hellhole of suffering? I did not sleep well that night.  You can download it here legally (it\u2019s open source). If you prefer a more let\u2019s play version, read through this walkthrough - it makes it easier to retain one\u2019s sanity. ",

            "answer_text": "Ok I'm giving an answer with those that I experienced that I think are the most disturbing. This are my personal preferences and some I haven't finished yet (out of time, can't find them anymore, etc). I'm not much of a gamer as I once was so don't expect new games. Also this list will be by the order they come to mind rather than most to least disturbing. 1- F.E.A.R. Ok so let's start with this one. This is the only one that's more gruesome than disturbing.  This is Alma. She was a little girl that was experimented upon all her life. After she got to decent age (13) the lab got her pregnant so she could have a child, killing her know the process. Few years later, a man that was connected to her got a call to investigate the site where she was experimented upon.  During his wanders, he sometimes stumbles into the Almaverse, an alternate reality where the place has Alma's pain in it. In the first game this is the most weird experience since (as you can see the pic) it's usually full of blood (most of the times on the roof) and you hear Alma in pain. She eventually breaks through reality and brings the Almaverse to the real world so you experience her suffering. It's at least messed up. 2- Amnesia   You probably have seen this game as this was the game that made let's plays thrive on YouTube. The game is about a man who is being haunted by (what I call) a curse. Meanwhile, a baron asks him to join and he'll help him. The way to keep the curse away? Getting vitae from people. The game starts slowly without much details on the process but you end up understanding that you start extracting vitae from thieves and murderers. That's a gray area but ok. But you eventually need more and end up creating a potion to make them forget they were tortured so you can extract more vitae from them. At this point I should say vitae is Latin for life force. And you still need more life force so you go into a village and kidnap innocent people to extract their life force so you don't die\u2026 At this point you're thinking \u201cthat's messed up\u201d but wait\u2026at this point when you know this you're in the castle's dungeon, where all the torture devices are kept.. And you get to relive the whole graphic experience of their tortures. Meanwhile you're also being chased by disfigured people that were taken their vitae away and are just wandering the castle. 3- Pokemon series Ok first of all this is not a troll entry but hear me out to the end. There's actually 3 things I find disturbing and mainly because the games are for children. First:  A while before the series it's been hinted over and over that there was a huge war, like a world war. This war was so deadly most people have died in it. You can see the only male adults are either gym leaders (let's be honest, there's 1 in this category and I'll explain later) or are team rocket grunts. Which leads to second point. Second: Team Rocket in the first games. Why team rocket and not the other teams? Well, team rocket has the last male adults in the first 2 areas. Which makes you wonder why? Why are there so many male adults trying to control their area? Is it because it's not theirs anymore? And this leads us to point: Third: the whole plot. I've seen a meme (don't remember where or by who) that was a mom saying: \u201cHappy 10th birthday son!! Here's a rat, go to the woods and don't comeback until you're the champion\u201d Ok I know, \u201cbut it isn't that bad\u201d. Well, it is since they are fighting against whoever wants to take back their own country. It's parents vs their children. It's actually a civil war. Also, if you start looking at entries about most ghost pokemon, you'll understand that world isn't so easy to live in. There are many, many things that want to kill you. The game is less graphical but you don't faint, you die if you don't win your battles.  4- White Day: A Labyrinth Named School\ufffc Couldn't end the list without a classic: Korean horror game. So the plot is. You're in love and want to put a letter in the desk of your crush on Korean Valentine's Day. So you go into the school..Which has a really\u2026  Really nice janitor who you start seeing killing a student that had the audacity to go back into the school at night time. Meanwhile you're escaping the janitor, you're encountering many, many people who have died in the school. And not beaten up. There's hanging ladies, ladies killed in the music room, in most classrooms, bathrooms.. Pretty much everything that can be a murder place IS a murder place. And I know, most of them are folklore but a school has 1\u20132 ghosts tops.. That one has over 50 ghosts which means there's something very, very wrong with it. ",

            "answer_text": "Welcome to RapeLay, the Rape Simulator.  In RapeLay, you take on the role of a stalker creeping up on three well-endowed women and groping, isolating and removing their clothes until you can stimulate their bodies enough to thrust your dick into them. While the game looks and plays comedic, with disembodied hands you control with your mouse to fondle and grope and thrust, there is no doubt that the subject matter is disturbing, and it takes a very special kind of person to enjoy this kind of theme.  There are lots of erotic games out there to slake your perversions and horny loins, but most of them are fairly benign, if stupid, like Sexy Beach:  Or even Dead or Alive Extreme Beach Volleyball.  But it takes a really special mindset to take pleasure in a game that is basically a Rape Simulator, and it\u2019s even a poorly-made one. I mean, if the gameplay elements were actually good and you had to stalk the girls, avoid capture, find creative ways to isolate them then I could actually see some sense in it. Sort of like how in Hitman you play an Assassin and need to properly plan out your kills. I can dig a Rape Simulation like that. But this game doesn\u2019t do any of that. You just choose a girl, have options to click and fondle them in broad daylight in a public place, they run off into a more secluded area where you keep doing the same thing until you get them naked and proceed with your dastardly work. It\u2019s not just a disturbing theme, it\u2019s incompetent and dumb. Really disturbing game catering to the lowest common denominator. ",

Because this is really spoilerish. The Last of Us. This game seems like a creepy zombie apocalypse game at first. Your daughter is killed right at the start by a soldier as you are escaping. But it\u2019s not a disease that turns people into Zombies - its a fungus (Ophiocordyceps unilateralis). And it\u2019s real, though as far as I know it doesn\u2019t currently affect humans: How the Zombie Fungus Takes Over Ants\u2019 Bodies to Control Their Minds  Years after the outbreak, the main character, now alone, is given the task to take a young girl (Ellie - who may be immune to the fungus) to the last team of doctors that can create a cure. From here it plays like a smart Zombie game as you trek across the US. You go through numerous scenarios where you protect Ellie, and where she saves you. It\u2019s full of little moments. She becomes like your daughter. And then, you get to the doctors. And find out that in order to create the cure, Ellie must die. And the doctors/scientists, the last of their kind, are armed and won\u2019t take no for an answer. So what do you do? Let your adopted daughter die for possibly saving all of humanity? Or do you say \u201cscrew that, life will find a way\u201d? And go out blasting? And if you do save Ellie - what do you say to her? You know she would have bought into what they were saying. She would have sacrificed herself. If you save her, it\u2019s for you. So, do you sacrifice her? Or do you save her, and by saving her save yourself? Me? Screw them. I blasted them all, and hightailed it back to a safe zone. Life would find a way. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh boi! Now this is a topic that would worth a deeper conversation, because many games have disturbing moments (for various reasons), altough just a few are disturbing as a whole. The first coming to my mind is the Binding of Isaac, which is a game about a baby, who is thrown in the basement for some religious reason and must survive, evading or defeating walking horrors in the process. I did not play it personally, but just a few gameplay videos were enough to keep me away from it. Some people say it is a worthy experience and i am inclined to try it sometime. American McGee's Alice games are quite disturbing as well, altough i enjoyed both games in terms of gameplay and adored the unique, stylish graphics, not to mention the fitting soundtracks. The story is about Alice's adventures in her twisted Wonderland, that is a result of her real life psychological problems, which is connected to a tragic, shocking past experience. Uncovering the real life part and what REALLY happened back then is quite disturbing. Both games are crazy, but in a very fitting, good way. Five nights at Freddies is also a title, that i have not played, but being chased by killer robot-animal-mascots that lurk in the dark, is an idea that really earns the \u201cdisturbing\" title. As for the rest, the other commenters already mentioned most of them, like Condemned, Dead Space and Silent Hill 2, leaving me with Fear (the paranormal scenes and uncovering their origin is quite disturbing near the end, same developers as Condemned by the way) and Penumbra games to mention only. There surely are more titles with moments or elements that would earn a place here, but for now I leave it at that. Hope you got at least part of the answer you are looking for! ",

            "answer_text": "I have played a couple Silent Hills, Doki Doki Literature Club, Corpse Party and This war of mine, from the games most frequently listed in these answers. But there is one japanese visual novel, that i havent played, which description, screenshots and mild spoilers are enough to make anyone consider all this previous games cute as fuck. Update: I completely forgot about the 3 Dead Spaces lol. Again, as someone who played them, i guarantee they are hardcore moe compared to the shit you will read below!  I dont know if i should be dissapointed for people not mentioning it and going as far as writting about a game so relatively cute and family friendly like the Danganronpas, or to be relieved for the fact that so few people in Quora has been involved with this shit. In Euphoria, you are a guy with an extreme rape and sadist fetish. So you are conveniently abducted by someone and placed within a building with several white rooms, filled with all the equipment necessary to do all the nasty shit you want. From what i understood about the plot, you need to participate in all the rape games suggested so everyone can escape. Anyone that decides to quit the game will get a fancy execution like in the danganronpas, with much less animation, but still a lot more perturbing. The robotic voice that you hear from the speakers makes all those rules, and it will never let it be as simple as penetrating\u2026 i could give more details about that, but it wont have the same impact if you dont see it for yourself on the screenshots. (Your Onestop Moe Download Store! <- Mangagamer\u2019s webpage, look for the game there) Persons abducted with the protagonist include: Childhood friendAnother friend 1 or 2 years younger than you (Protagonist is a high schooler)Your teacherAnother friend of your classClass presidentIm not sure if there is more\u2026What differentiate this from other indie rape oriented games is that there is a lot more graphic content, and is fully voiced. It even has an anime! I dont know how faithful that adaptation is, but i guess it only displays the \u201ctrue\u201d ending, which is achieved withing the game by making the right choices (yes you can do some choices, i dont know how much). If you really want a satisfactory, undebatable answer for your question, search the anime online and watch it*. And every time you think \u201chow the fuck can anyone enjoy this\u201d remember: the game is much worse! *: Look for it for free in one of those hentai webpages. Dont you dare somehow pay for it. Please dont contribute to the people who make this kind of sick shit. ",

            "answer_text": "I nominate Cry of Fear from the developer team Psykskallar.  This game is just downright disturbing. From the game design to the story and beyond, everything is twisted and mental. To make a long story short, I am going to explain the story in a oversimplified way. Our protagonist, Simon Henriksson, is in a bad mental state at the beginning of the game. Some time passes and all of the sudden, he gets driven over by a car which leaves him bounded to the wheelchair. He goes to therapy for his mental trauma caused by the accident. The doctor notices that Simon was mentally troubled even before the accident. Simon is prescribed by the doctor to write about his ideas and feelings down in a book. What follows are Simons twisted thoughts written down in that book and his slowly descent into madness. The gameply consist of trying to overcome gruesome challenges and monsters which Book Simon (The protagonist of the Book, Simon is writing) and the real Simon are facing to find. To be clear, only Book Simon is facing those monsters. Simon is the one who creates them in the Book to cope with his miserable life.  (Children) Appearance: Their appearance is that of a bloated, rotting corpse of a small child holding a knife in each hand. They wear a garment made of garbage bags and duct tape instead of clothes.\ud83e\udc55  (Sawer) Appearance: He is a considerably tall and skeletal creature wielding a chainsaw he is named after, and has multiple pins protruding from his head.\ud83e\udc55  (Sawrunner) Appearance: Sawrunner is a chainsaw wielding psychopath whose face is covered with three theater masks, disguising his real face.\ud83e\udc55 Those \"things\" are meant to represent the authors hideous feelings and thoughts about him or others. Those are only three out of variety of enemies. For more information: Cry of Fear Wiki Here is a really good video explaining the story and the mental state Simon is in. You should give it a try. It might be long but it is worth it. Video: Who is Simon? ",

            "answer_text": "I'll suggest one that is well-written and is creepy for two important reasons. The first reason is the content itself: heavily inspired by Lovecraft, but with themes of incest and other dark family history mixed in. The second is that it's a text adventure game, so the lack of graphics or sound allows your own imagination to get the better of you as you're reading through. The game is called Anchorhead. You can purchase the \u201cDirector's Cut\" on Steam, which does include sporadic illustrations, or you can find an interpreter for your device and download the original version at no cost. What makes this game so unsettling is the way the horror elements creep in. It does have some shock horror, but it's not limited to that. Sometimes it's the fear of discovery while hiding or eavesdropping. Other times, it's the feeling you get when you read a diary entry and wish you hadn't. The story begins with a melancholy backdrop. You play as a newlywed woman whose husband inherited a mansion in a little coastal town in New England. Sounds great, except you've lived in Texas your whole life, and you weren't planning on this kind of uprooting. Also, the whole town is hopelessly backwater and ugly, and the weather is dreary, all the more so because it's November. You have just arrived at the Real Estate agent's office, where you are supposed to pick up your house keys and go to your new home. Your husband dropped you off and went to go study at the local university. Now you're alone outside, and wondering why the office is locked and the agent isn't showing up. That's where the game begins. As you unravel the mystery, the plot just keeps growing more sinister. You'll learn about the the history of the town and its founder, all the way up and down the family tree. You'll meet people who will die to keep the town's secrets, secret. There will be places where you'll narrowly escape death or capture. Before it's over, you'll encounter monsters so hideous, you'll lose your marbles if you look directly at them. If it sounds interesting but solving puzzles in text adventure games is something you'd rather leave to the Zork junkies, don't despair. I put together a fan-based \u201cGuided Tour\" for your help and further enjoyment of the story. Enjoy. ",

When you get to the crossroads, you\u2019ll see a few choppers also heading there, and a cutscene appears, which shows that the stalkers are engaged in a skirmish with the military. Most of the time until you get there, the military wipes out the poor fellas, and you have to face twentysomething enemy combatants alone. If you defeat them, you can finally find Mole, who tells you to get to the underground level. Well\u2026 that place is pretty scary, and I had nightmares about it for a few days. It is almost pitch dark (save for some emergency lights) loaded to the brim with anomalies and a few bad guys whom you can\u2019t see clearly (you have to resort to the good ol\u2019 \u201caim for their flashlights/muzzle flash\u201d tactic), and you\u2019ll face two of the most fearsome mutants of the game, the bloodsucker and the controller. The bloodsucker could make itself almost invisible (if you observe carefully, you can see the glowing eyes of the beast, and some mirage-like phenomena while it is in invisible mode, but not much else), and the controller well, tries to control you with psi-based attacks. When I visited that place for the very first time, it was sometime around midnight, and it was pitch dark in my room. My adrenaline levels were high (thanks to the previous encounter with the military, and the random noises in the tunnels, which scares the ever-living crap out of you), but when the bloodsucker attacked me, I got so scared that I covered my face and fell off from my chair\u2026 then immediately climbed back, and sprayed like 200\u2013250 rounds from my AK before I managed to kill the mutant (most of the rounds were fired in vain). Here\u2019s a video about that level:  (Video courtesy of Youtube) There are some other areas in the game (Yantar, Labs X-16, X-18 and X-19) which can - and will - give you the creeps, but this place is the most disturbing of them all.

Even today I find this game creepy (it came out in 1988), but I can\u2019t recommend that you play it because the gameplay is too dated. The Colony (video game) The first Silent Hill: another pick for creepy weird atmosphere. Oddly not as creepy to me as the last game but still very creepy and probably the difference is based on personal bias rather than objective factors. Silent Hill Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s: Jump scares aside, those weird animatronics just give me the willies. Five Nights at Freddy's Bad Stuff Happens: Fate/Stay Night - The first two arcs just get my blood pumping but the final arc is pretty messed up. Fate Stay/Night - Search results Danganronpa - Students forced into a killing game Danganronpa Muv Luv - If you\u2019ve seen that scene you know what I\u2019m talking about. Otherwise, stick with it for about 60 hours. Muv-Luv Crazy Sex Stuff: Sengoku Rance - Not an outstanding, content wise, entry in the Rance series (apparently) but the only one I\u2019ve played. Rance X-change - Good ol\u2019 Japan! X-Change (series) Games I have been told are disturbing but haven\u2019t personally played: I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream - I\u2019ve read the short story which was moderately disturbing, and have been told that the game basically follows the same plot, how much that adds or detracts to the short story depends on how immersive the game is, which I cannot judge but one of my friends told me it\u2019s pretty disturbing. I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream (video game) Catherine - Premise sounds pretty messed up, part of the reason I never got around to playing it. Catherine (video game) Amnesia: The Dark Descent - Always wanted to give this a try but never really got around to it. Has some interesting mechanics that are to the best of my knowledge unique to the game. Amnesia: The Dark Descent Saya No Uta - In a genre filled with disturbing games (visual novels) this is reputed to be the most disturbing of all. Saya no Uta ",

This game starts off as a cookie clicker style idle game but once you start progressing the story your cat gets murdered and you sell its fur for money. Then doctor money contacts you and gives you a deadly virus and it costs all of your money to buy the antidote. But the antidote dosent work so you start selling fake organs to help cure the disease but at the end you have to fully upgrade your money machine and then make a ton of money only to have your entire machine break down and then doctor money claims there is a gift inside the tin can you had the whole time but you have to give away all your money to buy the can opener only to find that it is a can of beans and a week after you eat it your organs fail. The end!Presentable liberty. This game takes place at the same time as exoptable money but you are the exact opposite as what you were. You are a prisoner who is one of the few people not to have the virus so you are kept in quarantine. You get letters from multiple people but the first one is from doctor money. Soon enough you get a happy buddy to keep you company, by sending you letters of course. You also have a friend named Salvador. Your happy buddy is obviously poor and depressed and scared. He dies from the virus. You also get letters from Charlotte, the girl who runs the pastry shop next door to your cell. Towards the end she shoots herself out of depression and loneliness because you have no way of responding to her letters and she convinced herself you are dead. Once Salvador gets back from his vacation he tries to break you out by shutting off the generator as your lock is energy powered. He gets electrocuted and dies. Your cell, however, is opened and you go out only to realize that you were actually in an elevator the whole time and you reinstall the buttons. When you go down you can exit the building and go to the pastry shop only to find it full of blood and the game ends with you reading charlottes suicide note. An alternate ending involves you staying in your cell like dr money tells you to. He then explains that the shot you got when you first entered the prison was the only working antidote and you organs were the most expensive thing in the world now. He kills you and the game ends.",

            "answer_text": "I have seen some good suggestions already in this thread, among them are Spec Ops: The Line, This War of Mine, Doki Doki Literature Club, and Silent Hill 2. But many of the other games like Manhunt, Hatred, and Outlast are not (in my opinion) disturbing so much as shocking or frightening. To me, a game that is disturbing has to have moments of realization, or reveal, like a good magic trick. Disturbing games need to have a building of awareness about the horror you\u2019re facing. Without spoiling too much, all three of the above bolded games has a slow reveal of how horrifying the situation of the character truly is, and the player is forced to slowly come to terms with that horror. With that definition established, here are some of the most disturbing games I have ever played that most people aren\u2019t mentioning. All of the following are available on Steam or the Humble Store, and most are available on GoG  A Wolf in Autumn, Fingerbones, The Moon Sliver, The Music MachineThese four games, by the same single developer (David Szymanski), are extremely disturbing. Szymanski focuses his game creation on making emotionally impactful and narratively focused horror, and does it extremely well. The Moon Sliver is technically a prequel to The Music Machine, but you can play them in whatever order you want. The experience of playing each is hard to describe, but A Wolf in Autumn is about the experience of being trapped in an abusive situation, and the three others are about uncovering mysteries in very foreign worlds. They are well worth their (quite cheap) prices, and I highly recommend all of them.Fran BowFran Bow is a story about a young, mentally ill girl on a quest to return to her family with the help of her cat. Her journey is extremely strange, and disorienting to the player, and Fran. I actually have not finished it yet, as some of the puzzles can be quite complex, but it has been quite an experience so far.Lone SurvivorOriginally created as a pixel-graphics tribute to Silent Hill, Lone Survivor is a delightfully disturbing game all on its own, and one of my favorites. Your character is a survivor of some deadly disease that has ravaged his apartment complex, and the rest of the world. He must survive and find other survivors, but his isolation is steadily driving him mad and as the player, less and less of what you see and think you know about the world can be trusted as you progress.Knock-KnockKnock-Knock is a very strange game by Ice-Pick Lodge with very simple gameplay. It is not hard to beat, but it is extremely uncomfortable to play (I highly recommend headphones for the full experience, don\u2019t worry there are no jumpscares). You spend your sleepless nights wandering your house looking for the sources of noises, but awake in the forest outside every morning, and every night when the noises return, the house is a bit different than the last time you awoke.Everybody\u2019s Gone to the RaptureIn this game, you play a person who explores a small English village where an astronomical phenomenon has caused everyone to disappear. All that is left behind are people\u2019s belongings, and strange echoes of the last moments and encounters of the people in the village. It is a very disturbing experience walking through such an empty place listening to the last life that existed there.Pony IslandI can\u2019t tell you much about this game without spoiling the surprises in it, but I highly recommend it, I think it\u2019s very fun to play and well designed, and it\u2019s a bit more light-hearted than the other entries on my listHonorable mentions:These are games that are very disturbing, but for one reason or another I cannot recommend. Most of the time, I can\u2019t recommend them because they are extremely confusing and overwhelming to new players looking for a purely disturbing experience. Others I simply haven\u2019t played yet, but look very promising.PathologicThe VoidThe GrandfatherThe Cat LadyUncanny Valley Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoy my recommendations! ",

Because this is really spoilerish. The Last of Us. This game seems like a creepy zombie apocalypse game at first. Your daughter is killed right at the start by a soldier as you are escaping. But it\u2019s not a disease that turns people into Zombies - its a fungus (Ophiocordyceps unilateralis). And it\u2019s real, though as far as I know it doesn\u2019t currently affect humans: How the Zombie Fungus Takes Over Ants\u2019 Bodies to Control Their Minds  Years after the outbreak, the main character, now alone, is given the task to take a young girl (Ellie - who may be immune to the fungus) to the last team of doctors that can create a cure. From here it plays like a smart Zombie game as you trek across the US. You go through numerous scenarios where you protect Ellie, and where she saves you. It\u2019s full of little moments. She becomes like your daughter. And then, you get to the doctors. And find out that in order to create the cure, Ellie must die. And the doctors/scientists, the last of their kind, are armed and won\u2019t take no for an answer. So what do you do? Allow your followed girl die for possibly saving all of humanity? Or do you say \u201cscrew that, life will find a way\u201d? And go out blasting? of course you will do save your self Ellie - exactly what would you tell her? You know she would have obtained into whatever they had been saying. She'd have sacrificed herself. If you conserve the girl, it is for you. So, do you realy compromise the lady? Or do you really conserve the girl, and also by preserving the girl save? Me personally? Screw them. I blasted all of them, and hightailed it returning to a secure zone. Life would discover a way. ",
