            "answer_text": "I play all of those instruments so it's tough for me to tell. I'll just tell you how I feel about each then I'll answer Piano: once you know piano you can so much easier learn another instrument. You learn SO much from piano. You play so many more notes on a large scale at the same time. There are great things online to learn from on it because it's like the most popular instrument. Violin: I eventually quit this one and switched to cello. Orchestra and such can be very... Serious. Not super fun. But I've found a lot of really fun pieces online. When you first play violin it sounds terrible, but it can be totally worth it in the end. Cello: Cello has an extremely gorgeous sound. Look up Abigail cello on YouTube and you can take amazing lessons from there. I used the Suzuki method which got me far fast. It might  also have to due with the fact I had played a lot of instruments up to this point. But once you get it good it's SOOO perfect. Look up the piano guys and two cellos and you'll fall in love with the cello. Guitar: Guitar really hurts your fingers blister wise. But you can literally play SOOOO many popular songs with chords (same with piano) I knew 6 very popular songs fast because they all literally have the exact same chords. It's painful but beautiful. (Play ukulele if you want it very easy, you'll know 50 songs in the first month. I love it SOOO much) All in all if I had to choose one instrument to keep playing it would be cello piano or ukulele. What you choose has a lot to do with preference. ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to learn something quick and start playing some easy songs in just a few days, then go for the keyboard/piano.I think its easier compared to all the other string instruments you have mentioned here, because it's electronic and can produce correct notes easily. And you can understand music theory easily through a keyboard/piano, as music theory is often explained with representations and examples from keyboard/piano. Guitar, takes a bit longer to learn and the learning curve is slow to rise in the first 3-4 weeks. But guitar, once you have learnt it to some extent, can be very much fun as you can experiment with different styles of playing and maybe even form your own different style. And it looks so cool (the only reason you see so many teens running around with these). Violins, I find them to be in the same level of difficulty or maybe a little higher than learning guitar, as violins don't have Frets (divisions for notes) . But its only the initial phase that takes time and effort in all of these, and the later phases can be very enjoyable. I have never tired to play a Cello , but to my eyes it looks like its just as hard or even harder to learn than the violin as the fingering board or neck is much longer than violins. As a bonus I will add the Flute here.  Flutes are woodwinds and require stamina to play them . But I find the flute , especially Bansuri to be very pleasant to play and listen to. And flautists are actually  rare, so you can expect a high demand for your skills in bands once you learn it.For me personally the flute seemed easier to pick u and didn't take much time to start playing songs, because you only need to learn to play leading parts and there are no Chords to learn like the guitar. The violin has no chords either. But in the end I can only say that it all depends on what you want to play.Curiosity will only keep you interested for a few days, passion will make you last a bit longer. But consistent practice will be the only thing that will get you anywhere in all of these instruments. All the best , hope you learn and master all of those :) ",
