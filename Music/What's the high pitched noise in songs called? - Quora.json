            "answer_text": "Nice mix! It\u2019s quite dense, and I hear Pizzicato string plucks, and three high strings pads, two creating an octave and the third as a harmony. There is modulation on one or more of the high synth patches, which helps create a bit of a swirling movement. Chorus and other pitch modulation effects can help sounds jump out of a dense mix. These in tune notes rhythmically swing slightly sharp and flat, and we simply hear them as pitch correct, just like adding vibrato to a note. As to which synth plugin this is? The number of people making virtual instruments, or V.I.s as they are abbreviated, has exploded in the last five or so years. There are well over 25 synths for the composer that you could easily create these and similar sounds from. Check out U-He Virtual Synthesizer, Rob Papen, Izotope Iris 2, IK Multimedia, Waves Synthesizers, Sonivox, Relab, Arturia, East West, Native Instruments\u2026 These are but a few from a huge list of fantastic soundsmiths!
