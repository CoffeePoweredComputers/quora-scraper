            "answer_text": "A lot of what Eminem says is tongue-in-cheek. When he talks about Satan and pretty much any other thing that\u2019d strike people as controversial, he\u2019s trying to get a rise out of people. To make them stop and think about why he\u2019s saying what he\u2019s saying. To make a bunch of people who already hate his music angry. To make it clear that no subject is off limits to him. To reference things he\u2019s said on previous tracks. To fit into his \u201cpsycho killer badass\u201d Slim Shady persona. To talk about his \u201cdemons,\u201d as you say, metaphorically (things like drugs, alcoholism, suicidal thoughts, etc). And partly just because he can. ",
