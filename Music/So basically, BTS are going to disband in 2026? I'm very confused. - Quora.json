            "answer_text": "Most likely yes. Why? Let\u2019s see: Military: During this time, Jungkook will still be in the military. This is the order BTS is coming and going at (please note nothing is confirmed whether the members will serve, but it\u2019s almost certain they will). Also, remember they can leave anytime before their 28th birthday, this order is if they leave on their 28th birthday. Order*: 2020: Jin leaves (6 members left) 2021: Suga leaves (5 members left) 2022: J-Hope & RM leave, Jin and Suga return (5 members left) 2023: Jimin & V leave, J-Hope returns (4 members left) 2024: RM returns (5 members left) 2025: Jungkook leaves, Jimin & V return (6 members left) 2026: Nothing happens, but contracts end 2027: Jungkook returns (all 7 members back) (*The enlistment time is 18 months (1 year 6 months). J-Hope and Suga have their birthday\u2019s before June. J-Hope: February 2022 + 1 Year = February 2023 + 6 Months = July 2023. Suga: March 2021 + 1 Year = March 2022 + 6 Months = August 2022) Now let\u2019s look at age (the age they\u2019ll turn that year (international age)): (The \u2018*\u2019 means they are going or are in the military) 2020: J* = 28SG = 27JH & RM = 26JM & V = 25JK = 232021: J* = 29SG* = 28JH & RM = 27JM & V = 26JK = 242022: J = 30SG = 29JH* & RM* = 28JM & V = 27JK = 252023: J = 31SG = 30JH & RM* = 29JM* & V* = 28JK = 262024: J = 32SG = 31JH & RM = 30JM* & V* = 29JK = 272025: J = 33SG = 32JH & RM = 31JM & V = 30JK* = 282026: Contract Ends J = 34SG = 33JH & RM = 32JM & V = 31JK* = 292027: OT7 J = 35SG = 34JH & RM = 33JM & V = 32JK = 30Many idols retire by the age of 30 onwards. By the time the contract ends, the oldes, Jin, is already 34. It\u2019s already pretty surprising they resigned their contracts in the first place. I don\u2019t see them resigning their contracts, but I do still see them waiting for Jungkook until they full disband. Now, please remember this is: My opinionAnd things may change and Jungkook, in particular, may go to the military before he actually has to.Nothing is confirmed, just take everything I say to mind.BTS will eventually have to disband, nothing lasts forever. 2026, the year their contracts end, is reasonable and appropriate time to do so. The only other ways they can disband before their contract is: Lawsuits, drug scandals, etcIf something happens to BigHit Entertainment and they need BTS to disbandIf they simply decide they don\u2019t want to be an idol anymore.Either way, BTS will always be a part of ARMY\u2019s heart, and I think they had their time. They created a name for themselves, K-Pop, and Korea in history worldwide. ~Tian Tian ",

            "answer_text": "Who said they are going to disband in 2026? It isn\u2019t on any social media and the boys nor Big Hits didn\u2019t say anything. I guess another falsification and assumption going on. Let me fill you in with a little logic. STOP assuming things will happens. Every 7 years the boys has to renew their contract. You see back when they debut on June 13, 2013 started their first 7 years which isn\u2019t up tel June 13, 2020. They decided to renew their contract early in October of 2018 for another 7 years. So when we get to 2026 they will have the option to renew their contract with Big Hit and I\u2019m sure they will. Big Hits have been a great big family to the boys or they can go out on their own. In which they can do that too. But we are here in 2019 can you enjoy them now. Geez\u2026.Taehyung just dropped a solo song called Scenery today. Jimin dropped a solo song called Promise before the New Year. Jungkook did a cover of one of IU song and Suga collaborated with another singer. Not to mention the boys have a comeback album soon to be release in May. Live in the now\u2026 ",
