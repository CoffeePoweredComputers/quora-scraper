            "answer_text": "There are actually several different models of Telecaster. I myself have two, an American Standard Tele, which is what I\u2019m going to assume we\u2019re discussing here, and an FMT-HH Tele, which is really a Telecaster in name only, because it\u2019s so different. It has a set (glued on) neck as opposed to a bolt-on, it has a slightly arched top, and two coil-tapped humbucking pickups. I use mine mostly for playing slide. The Standard Tele looks like this:  Fixed bridge, two single-coil pickups, three position switch. This one has a rosewood fretboard, but they can also have maple necks. This is actually a very versatile guitar. I originally bought mine for those times when I want that distinctive Telecaster twang, but I\u2019ve since found that I\u2019ve been using it in many other situations, and been quite pleased with the result. As you probably know, rock/pop musicians like Bruce Springsteen, Keith Richards, Steve Cropper and Joe Strummer play(ed) Teles; eminent country guitarists include Albert Lee, Vince Gill, James Burton and Buck Owens; blues/rock musicians: Albert Collins, Mike Bloomfield, Jeff Beck, Roy Buchanan\u2026 the list goes on. I would not want to use a Telecaster for anything that involves high levels of distortion, like metal or heavy rock. This is in part due to the single-coil pickups, which can get pretty noisy at high volumes and high gain. It also lacks the aggressive tone that many metal players look for (which is one of the places where humbucking pickups can really shine). A Telecaster is a more nuanced sound, generally. As a footnote, I should point out that there\u2019s a fair bit of overlap across Fender products. A bit of tinkering with the sound can get a Tele to sound a lot like a Strat, and vice versa (you can\u2019t get the distinctive \u201cquack\u201d that a Strat has on the 2 and 4 switch positions, but you can get a lot of the other sounds reasonably close.) I\u2019ve also heard players make their Mustangs and Jaguars sound a lot like Teles as well. What it really comes down to is how the guitar \u201cworks\u201d for you, the player: whether you like its feel, its tone, its styling, its \u201cenergy\u201d, for want of a better word. I\u2019ve used this quote from Frank Zappa before, but it bears repeating: \u201cIf you pick up a guitar and it says, \u2018Take me, I'm yours,\u2019 then that's the one for you.\u201d Hope this helps.

            "answer_text": "Short answer: Any style that can be played on electric guitar. Most of the really popular electric guitar designs (Tele, Strat, Les Paul, etc.) have achieved their popularity by being versatile and suitable for a wide variety of styles. The two exceptions I can think of are if you require an acoustic guitar tone (in which case you need a guitar with some kind of transducer pickup in the bridge) or ultra high-gain styles (in which case you will probably need a guitar with humbucker pickups or active pickups).

There are maple and rosewood necks and different body woods that tweak the sound. There are only 12 notes in various octaves in western music. The Tele has all 12. ",

And sometimes it gets pigeon-holed as the perfect guitar for a country act. But plenty of other Blues and Rock artists have favored the Tele as well. Everybody from Muddy Waters and Curtis Mayfield to George Harrison and Keith Richards have been big fans. ",
