            "answer_text": "Information retrieval and recommender systems are hot and exciting technologies and it is a good and timely idea to focus your graduate study on these topics. People with graduate degrees and expertise in recommender systems and advanced IR are in high demand. Many top companies attend WWW and RecSys conferences annually while advertising exciting job opportunities. While I am not aware about a graduate program specifically focused on IR or RecSys, it doesn\u2019t matter much since it is the advisor, not the program is the key in graduate studies. Look at the proceedings or SIGIR, WWW, WSDM, RecSys, UMAP and identify a set of advisors you would like to work with. Find out which programs they are associated with and apply. To increase your chances, write to the advisor of choice, explain why you are interested, show your strong sides. Note: while IR and RecSys have a lot in common, there are rather few experts actively working in both fields. It is likely that you will need to make a choice. In this case, it is a good idea to apply to programs that have more than one faculty working in IR/RecSys area. You will have more people to advise you. ",
