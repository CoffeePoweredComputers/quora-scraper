            "answer_text": "Where do you begin?  No other producer was able to keep up with Kanye West during the 2000s. Not Just Blaze, not Timbaland, not The Neptunes, not even fucking Dr. Dre. Kanye's production style just kept evolving; incorporating more music genres, his sampling got more sophisticated and his imagination wouldn't stop expanding.   Here are his best beats in my opinion: \"This Can't Be Life\" for The Dynasty: Roc La Familia (2000)This is vintage Kanye -- heavy drum patterns and nostalgic soul samples. You can pretty much trace the start of his breakthrough to this song.  \"Takeover\" for \ufeffThe Blueprint (2001)\"Watch out we run New York!\" Oh my god, if people thought Kanye was just some soulful producer, they were dead wrong. Kanye was more than capable than producing a hard-hitting street banger. \"Girls, Girls, Girls [Remix] for \ufeffThe Blueprint (2001)The original Just Blaze version is gorgeous, the Kanye remix is fucking HOT! \"Two Words\" for \ufeffThe College Dropout (2004)This was the track that made me realise just how strong a lyricist Kanye truly is. He blew Mos Def and Freeway off the track and delivered one of his many career-defining verses. But the production itself was on some epic shit -- the slow buildup with the harpsichord, the boom-bap drums, the choir in the background -- it's one of those gems that always gets buried beneath all hits.   \"The Corner\" for \ufeffBe (2005)Kanye had a big hand in reviving Common's career with his production work on Be. He brought it back to raw, soulful beats and boom-bap drum loops. Common sounded rejuvenated rapping over Kanye beats and \"The Corner\" was the first example.  \"Gold Digger\" for \ufeffLate Registration (2005)Not only was Kanye super-talented with beat-making, he also knew how to make a hit. Combining a Ray Charles sample and some dirty drums, Kanye had everybody bumping \"Gold Digger,\" even to this day. \"Diamonds from Sierra Leone\" for \ufeffLate Registration (2005)This track was designed for some epic stadium packed arena shit, period. \"Stronger,\" \"Flashing Lights\" and \"Good Life\" for \ufeffGraduation (2007)Graduation was when Kanye's style just leapfrogged over everybody else's and it's these 3 songs that showcase it most. When I heard \"Stronger\" and \"Flashing Lights\" -- it was like nothing I've ever heard in my life. Props to \"Good Life\" for sampling Michael Jackson and making T-Pain sound like a champion.  \"Swagga Like Us\" for \ufeffPaper Trail (2008)For some producers, they make a few big hits, then they get comfortable, then they start making weak beats. Not Kanye, he kept it strictly raw hip-hop with this track -- one of the hardest beats in his career.  \"Amazing\" for \ufeff808s and Heartbreaks (2008)If Kanye hadn't made 808s and Heartbreaks then my guess is that My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy wouldn't have been so brilliant. There's a lot of elements from \"Amazing\" that laid the foundation for the next album.  \"Monster\" and \"So Appalled\" for \ufeffMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010)With these 2 songs, Kanye brought it back to some of that old 90s East Coast gutter Biggie-Nas-Mobb Deep-Wu-Tang shit -- hard as fuck and totally addictive.  \"Runaway\" and \"All of the Lights\" for \ufeffMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010)2 of Kanye's most ambitious tracks to date. And the thing is, he succeeds with  both of them.  \"Otis\" for \ufeffWatch the Throne (2011)This was like \"Gold Digger\" for 2011. A little bit harder, but just as catchy. This time it was Otis Redding not Ray Charles who covered the hook. ",

I don't know a single person that doesn't get hyped up when that comes on.  Classic Kanye: \"Crack Music\", \"Addiction\", \"Get Em High\", \"Last Call\", \"Bring Me Down\", \"Touch the Sky\" (The horns from Curtis Mayfield's \"Move On Up\" get me every time.) EDIT: I'd like to add \"Two Words\" to my list, can't believe I overlooked it, classic Kanye.  Beats he's done for others: \"Get By\" off Talib Kweli's album of the same name and \"Takeover\" for Jay-Z are classics.  ",
