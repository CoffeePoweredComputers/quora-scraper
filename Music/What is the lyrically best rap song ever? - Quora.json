            "answer_text": "This is an interesting question. I can't nominate a song that is \"lyrically\" the best because I think there is no standardized way of judging what makes one song \"lyrically better\" than another, but I do have a nomination for two incredibly deep and lyrical rap songs (which I will mention later). There are many variables (family lives, experiences growing up, influences from other peers in their lives both from the rap game and their personal lives, their tastes in other music, etc.) that go into the content that rappers put out, so it's very hard to find a commonality among all the rap songs we hear and make a singular and \"end-all\" decision on the best rap song of all time (lyrically). However, I do have TWO nominations for songs that came out quite recently. For the award of \"incredibly deep and thought-provoking/emotion-jerking along with amazing sounding\" rap songs, I would like to nominate: Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst  by Kendrick Lamar  and Own Appeal by Oddissee  PLEASE, PLEASE, AND PLEASE read these verses, and for a much deeper and insightful understanding of their verses, go to the Rap Genius links I will include at the end and read the annotations line by line. It will only take 10-15 minutes of your day, and I promise you won't regret it. Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst [Verse 1]I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you\nIn case I'm not here tomorrow, I'm hoping that I can borrow\nA peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important\nMy mind is really distorted, I find nothing but trouble in my lifeI'm fortunate you believe in a dreamThis orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routineAnd last night was just another distraction or a reaction\nOf what we consider madness, I know exactly what happened\nYou ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help\nHeld him like a newborn baby and made him feel\nLike everything was alright and a fight he tried to put up\nBut the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will\nAs blood spilled on your hands, my plans rather vindictive\nEverybody's a victim in my eyes\nWhen I ride, it's a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch black\nA demon glued to my back whispering, \"Get em\"I got 'em, and I ain't give a fuck\nThat same mentality that told my brother not to duckIn actuality, it's a trip how we trip off of colorsI wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recoverThe life that I knew as a young'n in pajamas and dun-ta-dunsWhen thunder comes it rains cats and dogsDumb niggas like me never prosperPrognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well devotedThis piru shit been in me forever\nSo forever I'mma push it, wherever, wheneverAnd I love you cause you love my brother like you did\nJust promise me you'll tell this story when you make it bigAnd if I die before your album drop, I hope [gunshots]   [Verse 2]You wrote a song about my sister on your tape\nAnd called it \"Section.80,\" the message resembled \"Brenda's Got a Baby\"What's crazy was, I was hearin about it\nBut doubted your ignorance how could you ever just put her on blast and shit\nJudging her past and shit, well it's completely my future\nHer nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit\nAnd I'mma need that 40 dollars even if I gotta\nFuck, suck and swallow in the parking lotGonzales Park, I'm followed by a married man, a father of three\nMy titties bounce on the cadence of his tinkling keysMatter of fact, he my favorite \u2019cause he tip me with E'sHe got a cousin named David and I seen him last weekThis is the life of another girl damaged by the system\nThese foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'emSee, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em back\nTo where they used to be then I'll probably be in the denim\nOf a family gene that show women how to be woman\nOr better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'\nThen you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taughtThree niggas in one room, first time I was tossed\nAnd I'm exhausted, but fuck that \"Sorry for your loss\" shit\nMy sister died in vain, but what point are you trying to gain\nIf you can't fit the pumps I walk in?\nI'll waitYour rebuttal a little too late\nAnd if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song\nCause I don't need the attention bring enough of that on my ownAnd matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?\nA doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straightI'll probably live longer than you and never fade away\nI'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate\nAnd I'm on the grind for this cake, I'mma get it or die trying\nI'm eyeing every male gender with intentions of buyingYou lying to these motherfuckers, talking about you can help 'em\nWith my story, you can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga\nDon't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga...   [Verse 3]Sometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself:\nAm I really scared of passing away? If it's today, I hope I hear a\nCry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon\nWith the holy ghost 'til it drown in the blood of JesusI wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline\nReeking the scent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance\nWith the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed\nMay the wound help my mother be blessed for many moons\nI suffer a lot, and every day the glass mirror\nGet tougher to watch; I tie my stomach in knotsAnd I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death\nMy imagination is surely an aggravation of threatsThat can come about, \u2019cause the tongue is mighty powerfulAnd I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouchMaybe cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of deathReally stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'mma restAnd you're right, your brother was a brother to me\nAnd your sister's situation was the one that pulled me\nIn a direction to speak of something that's realer than the TV screenBy any means, wasn't trying to offend or come between\nHer personal life, I was like \"It need to be told\"\nCursing the life of twenty generations after her soul\nExactly what'd happen if I ain't continued rappin'Or steady being distracted by money drugs and four-\nFives, I count lives all on these songs\nLook at the weak and cry, pray one day, you'll be strong\nFighting for your rights even when you're wrong\nAnd hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm goneAm I worth it?\nDid I put enough work in?                         I hope you enjoyed that, but now on to Own Appeal.   [Verse 1]I never asked to be born, and death's no questionThe sun's still shining off the same old lessons\nThen why does life feel like an educated guess and\nMy thoughts are like meals I'm a sucker for the secondsImpressions got a lot of us stressing, but how we are perceived is more about a reflection\nThe reception warm that I receive\nWhich leads to believe these hoes like what I heaveTall women in heels, tour money and deals\nOff the no bull I like all money for realMore time aboard and less time at home\nLess time for broads and more time in zonesYeah, I'm in it while flying out of another oneThis is a new beginning, I'm climbing out of the other one\nThe dream feel real'er than it ever beenAnd I was aiming high like a nigga being president\nThe possibilities of that are seeming pretty evidentSo being self employed is not seeming like a definite\nBut staying that way is what I'm F'ing with\nAnd like minded people are the only ones I'm messing with   [Verse 2]I'm trying to get mine in this life time\nThe after life is much further in pipelineI'm in inclined to believe that but truth is, that for death, any moment is the right timeSo I live like everyday is my last\nBut I plan for tomorrow as if I will never passA Pharoah on the subway\nWho never had dreams of jets but fell asleep on run waysI just know that one day, that anything I needed I could moldGet everything you want it ain't always good for the soul\nA mix of self worth, some help, a little controlAnd I don't know the rest, good as mine is your guessThe recipe ain't the best, to make it though is our quest\nAnd if you choose to accept, the meaning of life is yesCause only God knows, those of us in the flesh, get the privilege of testSome will fail and some will pass\nWe all get the same grade though when we run the pathBut how you grade your self is the mark that will matter most\nTo separate the heart of the strong and the battered folks\nHave a dose   [Verse 3]\nAyo, shit so real, I kill shit to live nigga, schizo feelI got a hunger for knowledge and I miss no mealsI stay high off life and I miss no pills\nI'm addicted to thrill of walking along the edge\nNot knowing what lays ahead but always knowing the dealI'm good with my decisions, the set backs and gains\nIs all apart of the game, I'm ready to spin the wheelWhat ever is in store, I'm ready for, for sure\nThe attitude of wealth with the gratitude of the poorThe balance is the challenge and I sit so stillBetween callus and analysis but this no frillsI'm off the chain, been that way since slaves to FlavFrom 93 till infinity I'm slated in ways\nThat's etched in stone\nThe age where we market our selvesI'm still all about the music I don't monitor plays\nI don't monitor hits and I don't monitor clicks\nI monitor the snare drum and the bottom of kicksIs anybody left that still fuck with this true shitWell let me hear you scream over top of this CRU shitHere are the links I promised: Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst:Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst Own Appeal:Oddisee \u2013 Own Appeal Of course, there are many other amazing songs, but these are just the two that came to my mind immediately since I had listened to them recently.
