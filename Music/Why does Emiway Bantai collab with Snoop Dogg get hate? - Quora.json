            "answer_text": "Simple Answer Because it wasn't a Collab at all! A collaboration means a project in which both the artists come together, and work on that. What emiway did, he just remixed snoop Dogg and lexz pride's verse from one of their old songs into a different beat and added his verse into it. This wasn't bad. What was bad that he projected it as if he and snoop Dogg had collaborated with each other for a new track\u2026 Hip Hop lovers in India did not like this. P.S. you would be wondering how he got the rights to snoop dogg's song, he just bought it! And even snoop Dogg didn't share or post anything about the song before the release. It seemed as if he didn't even knew that a guy from India had remade his verse. He only posted about the song after a day or two. Thank you for reading. You can suggest me more questions like this ",
