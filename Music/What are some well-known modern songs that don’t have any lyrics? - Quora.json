            "answer_text": "I wrote an answer to a similar question: Ben Waggoner's answer to What is the highest charting song that has no lyrics? This includes Jan Hammer\u2019s \u201cMiami Vice Theme,\u201d Vangelis\u2019s \u201cChariots of Fire Theme,\u201d Love Unlimited\u2019s \u201cLove\u2019s Theme,\u201d and Edgar Winter\u2019s \u201cFrankenstein.\u201d But \u201cwell-known\u201d made me think of songs that you commonly hear at sporting events. They may or may not get far on the charts, and they\u2019re not necessarily what you\u2019d want to listen to while relaxing at home\u2014but for getting people up on their feet and cheering for the Possum Grape Marauders or whatever their home team is, these are ideal. Charting or not, they\u2019re well known. I hear Gary Glitter\u2019s \u201cRock and Roll, Part 2\u201d pretty often. Gary Glitter himself got busted for child pornography and molestation, and he\u2019s generally hated today. But I still hear \u201cRock and Roll Part 2\u201d a lot at my university\u2019s sporting events\u2014possibly because he wasn\u2019t that well known in the US, and people may not be aware of what he did. (See The Vibes of Victory, written before he was busted. I hope he\u2019s not getting royalties for it now.) It also featured in the movie Joker. And it doesn\u2019t have any lyrics except for people yelling \u201cHey!\u201d and \u201cUgh!\u201d  There\u2019s also \u201cPopcorn,\u201d written by Gershon Kingsley in 1969 but probably best known as covered in 1972 by a band called Hot Butter. This is the kind of thing you might hear at basketball games as the team is warming up:  Zombie Nation\u2019s \u201cKernkraft 400\u201d does have synthesized voices saying \u201cZombie Nation\u201d, and a bunch of voices singing \u201cOh-oh-oh-oh\u201d, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d call those lyrics as such. This is also a stadium favorite.  Stadiums are also known to play one of the most badass surf guitar anthems of all time, Dick Dale\u2019s immortal \u201cMisirlou,\u201d which also featured prominently in Pulp Fiction:  And in the 1990s, the Chicago Bulls used to play \u201cSirius\u201d by the Alan Parsons Project as the team was introduced. My university team uses it now (possibly because Scottie Pippen is an alumnus). Most of the YouTube videos of this song are blocked for me on copyright grounds, but you can hear it here:  ",
