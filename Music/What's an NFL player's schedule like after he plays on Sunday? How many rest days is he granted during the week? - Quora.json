            "answer_text": "Different teams have different policies, in some cases, even for different players (eg, veteran players may be expected to practice less than rookies). A typical work week will often vary based on the most recent result, the point in the season, and what is at stake. It\u2019s hard to imagine a team well out of playoff contention, or a team with their division locked up, with three games to go, for example, practicing the same way as a team who need 2 wins out of their last three to gain a wildcard spot. There are, simply put, too many variables to say with any kind of certainty what any given week looks like for any given player. For example, during the Amazon Series \u201cAll In\u201d former Arizona Cardinals head coach was, on multiple occasions, seen rewarding his team with additional rest days after a solid win, only for, on one notable occasion, Defensive Captain to overrule him, and insist that his group would be returning to practice as normal, as they still had some mistakes to fix. However, for a typical player, on a typical team\u2014insofar as one exists\u2014it will probably look something like this. Monday\u2014Most teams expect at least some players to report to the facility on Monday. This will vary depending on the player. For some, it will be to begin initial treatment for any minor knocks or injuries sustained during the previous game. Depending on the team, there may also be some strength and conditioning work that takes place, however, in recent years, individual teams strength and conditioning regimes diverged a lot, and \u201cnew school\u201d strength and conditioning coaches may vary this up a lot. There will typically be some kind of positional team meetings, including film review, and the distributing the initial game plan for their upcoming opponent, and there may be a simple walkthrough of some of the key plays, though it is very unlikely that there will be any real practice today. Some teams may reward their teams by giving their team, or at least their key veteran players, an extra day off here, and though the facility will be open for those in rehab, or who want extra time training, for some teams, players actually reporting on Mondays may be optional, and the key info may be shared electronically. Tuesday\u001f\u2014This is often designated as the players day off. Some teams will flip Monday and Tuesday, but the standard is usually got do the film work while everything is still fresh. Therefore, in most teams, the day off is a Tuesday. Their time is their own, and so, while they may choose to do Football activities, either together as a team, or position group, or as individual players, this is optional. Like any job, NFL players may sometime feel that they need to work on their day off, either getting in some extra reps, doing some additional study or prep work, or trying to work through a niggling injury that has kept them off the field, or on the flip side, may decide that they want to go out together to celebrate, particularly after a big win, but this this will be directed by the players themselves, not the teams. NFLPA rules prohibit teams from requiring their players to report to the facility on whatever day is designated as the \u201cplayers day off\u201d, but, particularly when teams are in the thick of it, or individual players feel like they are \u201con the bubble\u201d you will likely find a noticeable percentage of the team around the facility on Tuesdays nonetheless. Wednesday and Thursday\u2014This is typically when practices begin in earnest for NFL Players. They will spend the bulk of their working day on the field, with workouts, study, planning, and other preparation work peppered throughout. Typically, Wednesday will focus more on general technique and skills, while Thursday will be more about specific game planning, with the opponents in mind, but different teams will have their own routines throughout this period. This is where the bulk of the on field work happens. This is where players are in pads, and practicing at full speed\u2014or near enough. It is gruelling, and intense, and its where players prove their metal, and teams really hone their game plan for the week. Friday and Saturday\u2014This will change a lot depending on whether you are the home, or away team, and how far you are travelling. If teams are travelling across country, particularly from west to east, travel will usually happen early on Friday, with a relaxed evening on Friday, and possibly just some light meetings and strategy discussion throughout the day, to give players extra time to get over the jet lag, and final walkthroughs and preparations taking place on Saturday, whereas if you are the home team, or are not travelling too far, the bulk of Friday may be set aside for situational practice (red zone, 2 and 5 minute drills, etc.), with Saturday being the lighter day of the two. At some point on these days, teams will want to carry out a full walkthrough of the game, and time is set aside on Saturday for the visiting team to do so in the stadium. By this point, however, things are generally pretty light. both days will have a much lighter schedule, than Wednesday and Thursday, as teams want to ensure that their players are not exhausted before the start of the game on Sunday. Teams generally agree that if you\u2019ve got the basics down by Thursday, you\u2019re not doing yourselves any favours by trying to keep at it on Friday or Saturday. ",

            "answer_text": "Things like Thursday Night or Monday Night Football will change the schedule slightly. But generally speaking\u2026 MONDAY: Is film day for pretty much everyone. Some teams will implement a \u201cVictory Monday\u201d rule (the Vikings do this), where if you win on Sunday you don't have to come in on Monday. Because everything is digital now, coaches will upload the game film cut ups and players can then go over film on their own at home. Some guys will come in for treatment on Monday if they're re-habbing or trying to get back into the lineup from being injured. Others might choose to get some workouts in. TUESDAY: Generally this is the players official off day, sometimes it will get switched to better accomodate the schedule but generally it's Tuesday. Players are on their own, some guys still will come in but there is no planned team meetings or anything. Treatments for guys injured would still happen on the day off. WEDNESDAY: This is \u201cMonday\u201d for players in terms of their work week. It's one of the busier days of the week because they have team and position meetings, they'll do positional drills, and start going through their Game Prep. Any tweaks or changes for the upcoming game are implemented on Wednesday. THURSDAY: Basically like Wednesday. They'll go over more situational stuff like Red Zone Offense etc. FRIDAY: Special teams, trick plays, they all get added on Friday. It's usually a light day and guys are usually out by noon or so. SATURDAY:. Walk Thru day at their facility. If they're at Away, they'll go through Customs check at the facility then load the buses to the airport. If they're Home, they get the afternoon and early evening off. But even at Home, they have to report to the team hotel by a certain time for final meetings, just like on the road. At Home guys usually take their own cars to the hotel then drive to the Stadium in the morning ",
