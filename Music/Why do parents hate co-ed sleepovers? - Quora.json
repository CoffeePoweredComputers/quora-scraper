            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve always wanted to have a co-ed sleepover. All of my friends are females. Why in the world wouldn\u2019t I want to hang out with them; staying up all night, watching B-rated horror movies and eating sour gummy worms? Of course, I\u2019ll never have the opportunity to have them spend the night in my house, or even anywhere in my vicinity, most likely. I can understand why.  I can\u2019t say that it doesn\u2019t make sense for parents to disagree with co-ed sleepovers. Teenagers tend to be hormone-crazed, sex-driven monsters, especially between the hours of 12 A.M and 11:59 P.M. Even the most trustworthy of teens will make a bad decision just because testosterone/estrogen told them to. Who in their right mind would leave two opposite-gendered teens in a bedroom together all night? I sure wouldn\u2019t.  Put yourself in a parent\u2019s shoes. Co-ed sleepovers just aren\u2019t a chance worth taking. Sure, maybe your child isn\u2019t heterosexual and all of their friends are the opposite gender, but what happens when a sleepover goes wrong and somebody ends up pregnant? Child support is expensive. Children in general are expensive; and I can\u2019t imagine the time and emotional stress that they require. Abortions sure don\u2019t guarantee anything, either. I know several women who regret aborting their would-be children.  All of those problems are far more likely to be avoided by not having co-ed sleepovers. Do I wish that my parents would let me spend the night at my best-friend-who-happens-to-be-female\u2019s house? Yes, I most certainly do. Do I understand why it won\u2019t ever happen? Absolutely. ",
