            "answer_text": "I own a music store so I see all kinds of customers from beginners to advanced students, pros, hobbyist and just about everyone in between. One particular experience was a few years ago when I had a young man who was still in high school come in and ask me for a job. 1st he had no idea if I needed anyone at that time, which I didn\u2019t and 2nd he had no idea what the job would entail if I was looking. He just thought he could hang out in the store play the various instruments all day long and get paid for it. He even had a resume filled out. What was interesting about the resume is he claimed to be a multi-instrumentalist and he had mastered over 20 instruments\u2026. Really????? On his resume he listed every instrument he ever played. He didn't just claim to be a saxophonist but a multi saxophonist and had played and mastered not only alto sax but the Selmer Bundy, Yamaha YAS-23 and YAS-52 and a few other models. He listed at least 3 tenor saxophones he had played including a Selmer Mark VI that was owned by his high school. He also listed every Baritone sax by model that his high school owned as well as a single soprano. Was he a multi-instrumentalist? No he wasn\u2019t he was a saxophone player and believe me he was far from being a master. Saxophones were his tools but he was just a saxophonist. Yes he had played every common size and various makes but this by no means made him a multi-instrumentalist any more than a master carpenter would be a master of the hammer, a master of the saw, and a master of the square.

            "answer_text": "Since all saxophone models share the same fingerings, meaning that if you can play one model, you technically can play all of them, most people will consider you a sax player, without listing the sizes you own or play. I\u2019ve seen the following versions on record covers: All sizes listed separately;Saxophones (with or without the list of sizes);Saxophone.In most cases it was \u201csaxophone\u201d or \u201csaxophones\u201d, and in all cases the saxophone player played at least two different sizes of the same instrument. On other records, guitarists playing electric and acoustic guitars, ukuleles, and some other plucked strings are listed as playing guitar, guitars, plucked instruments, or the whole list of instruments; sometimes indicating the track numbers too where they play certain instruments. These might be important on a record, even if just to fill some empty space\u2026 but nobody really cares who played those 2\u20133 notes on a glockenspiel or zither on the fifth track. I played guitars with 4, 5, 6, 7 and 12 strings, ukuleles and guitaleles, but when asked, I always considered that I play the guitar. Five different types of lute: I play the lute. Three different sizes of cello: I play the cello. Five different sizes of recorder: I play the recorder. My niece plays the harp: she won\u2019t list all the different sizes and types she tried. Not to mention my nephew, who is a percussionist: to enumerate all the instruments he plays, from big drum and triangle to marimba would make him look self-important. My most recent favorite saxophone player plays any size she can put her hands on, but she is always introduced as playing the saxophone. The only time sizes were mentioned was when she bought a new saxophone, just before a TV show, where she played it for the first time. But it\u2019s up to you. If you consider that you can play them differently enough, mention them separately. If not, just be content with being a saxophonist \u2014 besides, that name covers all sizes\u2026 ",
