            "answer_text": "No. Even subjectively it is not. But it is a really great melody that tells a story, critical to great solos. I also like the solo in \u201cLove Reign O\u2019er Me\u201d by the Who. And everyone will remind us of the \u201cComfortably Numb\u201d outro solo by Pink Floyd. But you have to give a nod to \u201cRock Around The Clock\u201d by Bill Haley and the Comets, \u201cThat\u2019ll Be The Day\u201d by Buddy Holly and, of course, \u201cJohnny B. Goode\u201d by Chuck Berry. Best of all time means different things to different people. And it doesn\u2019t have to mean technically amazing, either. One of the best solo sections I would mention doesn\u2019t even involve a guitar, but a violin. The song is \u201cWhite Bird\u201d by It\u2019s A Beautiful Day. The solo section in this song is just brilliant. An amazing song in the pantheon of rock and roll. The outro solo to \u201cCloser To Home\u201d by Grand Funk is really beautiful, and simple, and perfect. Not trying to impress anyone at all, but just creating a wonderful tapestry over the accompaniment. Another amazing solo is on the song \u201cPeak Hour\u201d by the Moody Blues from \u2018Days Of Future Past\u2019. Just a whole lot of fun and good energy, perfect fit for this tune. You really have to think about questions like this because, at least for me, it involves more than just technical wizardry. Of course there are more great solos I haven\u2019t mentioned. But this gives you an idea where I stand on the question. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. The dueling guitars of Don Felder and Joe Walsh is one of the greatest guitar finales to any rock song, period. It was recorded in the control room of Criteria Studios in Miami over three days. Producer Bill Szymczyk called it the highlight of his career. Felder starts it, followed by Walsh, then they trade short solos before capping it with the harmony arpeggios. Well thought out, immaculately played, and perfect. Interestingly, I like the spanish guitar version on the live Hell Freezes Over album at least as well. It\u2019s very clear on both recordings who the better guitarist is. Don Felder was and is a monster. Joe was great, but couldn\u2019t carry Felder\u2019s guitar case. It\u2019s unfortunate that Felder and the Eagles parted ways. In some ways, they haven\u2019t really been the same band since. ",
