            "answer_text": "Don't compare BTS and BP. BTS are seniors and BP are juniors now. BTS is from a small company while BP is from the 2nd most powerful company in the industry. But if you really wanna know, Blackpink's fans don't come any close to the honest loyalty and their number. BTS are much much more famous than BP right now and I don't think they will overtake them any soon unless they give a smashing comeback and increase their frequency of comebacks instead of once a year. BTS has broken records that were previously held by legends like Michael Jackson and The Beatles. They have won on the Billboards. BP still have a long way for them to be fairly compared to BTS. ",

I respect Blackpink, and Blinks for the hustle (in terms of views), but I BTS are definitely more popular than BP. I think that (WITH NO DISRESPECT TO BLACKPINK) album sales, sold out stadiums worldwide etc speaks louder than views. However both groups are great, and honestly the fan wars need to stop ",
