            "answer_text": "Jennie and Lisa can rap much better than most other female idolsStop saying they suck at rapping because they\u2019re way better than your typical female idol rapper. Most female idol rappers are pretty lame and just talk rap. Lisa\u2019s and Jennie\u2019s rapping have pretty good flow and it suits their songs. To sum it up, they may not be the best, but they are far from the worst, so stop treating them like your faves are any better because chances are, they\u2019re not. Ros\u00e9 has the potential to become one of the best female vocalists of her generationStop acting like all hope is gone for her vocals. People say that her voice sounds like a \u201cdying goat\u201d when chances are, they probably sound like the \u201cdying goat\u201d themselves. Her voice is super unique and although she may not be the best, she is still quite a good vocalist. With more training, she can be a phenomenal singer and I really hope that happens, so that I can see your priceless reactions. Lisa is nowhere near an average dancerShe is an amazing dancer and people love to discredit her for that. Somebody could say that Lia is a better dancer than Lisa and everybody would agree. Stop acting like you\u2019re a professional dancer because if you threw away your bitterness and jealousy and bought some glasses, you would see that she is among the best dancers in K-pop. Both YG and Blackpink need each otherYG is part of the Big Three and as soon as they debut a new group, the group would have instant success. Blackpink definitely would not be as popular without YG, but if YG didn\u2019t have them, he would not be as big either. He only has 2 other groups and 1 band who are in the 3rd generation. The rest are or were in the 2nd or 1st generation and he doesn\u2019t really have a need for them right now, so they\u2019re pretty much useless to him. Akmu are a duo band and they don\u2019t necessarily have the qualities to be super famous. Ikon has already lost B.I and things have gone downhill from there. Winner are decently popular, but not enough for YG. 2NE1 have already disbanded and Big Bang are on hiatus because of the members in the military. Who does that leave YG with? Blackpink. Blackpink are pretty much carrying YG at this point, and if they leave, YG would be in a hot mess. Their personalities are fake to an extentBeing cute and cringey does not automatically mean they are fake. Jisoo is most likely the most real out of the four, but that does not mean the others are completely fake. Whenever they do aegyo, I always see some people say they\u2019re fake just because they don\u2019t like it. It always makes me roll my eyes because they might genuinely enjoy doing aegyo. Besides, they\u2019re celebrities, so don\u2019t act so surprised when they don\u2019t act like open books for you to read and gossip about. They won\u2019t become unpopular just because you want them toI get that you\u2019re jealous. I get that you\u2019re bitter. But the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you. What a big surprise, right? Just stop being so obsessed with Blackpink and hating on them and go stream your faves. Remember, K-pop is an industry where nothing is fair and everyone fights for their spot. ",

            "answer_text": "These are not meant to offend anyone and are not anything but my own opinions. You can feel free to disagree these are just my observations. 1)Jennie seems happier with fashion work than music. This one hurts me so much but seriously Jennie gets so much hate for everything she does as a Blackpink member and she is CLEARLY aware of it. I have noticed myself that ever since d4 she seemed happier doing modeling and fashion related work than when BP has a comeback and I believe it is mostly because of the fact that she gets hated and criticized the most during that time. The hate definitely affected her mentally and it really affects things you are passionate about. That being said I hope she has a counselor or a therapist that she can talk to. I don\u2019t want to diagnose anything as I have no right but I hope she is getting help. 2)Lisa and Rose are not the best dancer/singer respectively but they are GOOD. This one is a popular opinion but a hard to swallow fact for many blinks from what I have seen. I feel like people go to the extreme when it comes to this, it is either they are the best no one can beat them or they are the worst and downright terrible. Neither of which is true. 3)Lisa and Rose seem like the only ones actually interested in idol life now. Like I mentioned in the first point, Jennie seems to have lost interest in idol life and Jisoo was meant to be an actress and I can still see her wanting to pursue that path more. Hats off to her for giving her best as an idol and improving so much but I personally feel myself she would be happier being an actress. 4)Lisa is the most suitable as a soloist and should have gotten her solo debut before Jennie. She can rap, sing, dance, has good stage presence, and also a variety personality. And she has the visuals needed by Koreans. She also seems the happiest to be on the stage and doing her job compared to the other girls. 5)Blackpink NEEDS YG. I am sorry to say but the only reason Blackpink is successful is because of YG. Their concept, music, choreography, EVERYTHING is given to them by YG. They have absolutely no input in anything at all and these are the factors that made them popular. Yes, they have talent, but it is not so outshining that they would have been immediately successful outside of YG. If Blackpink were to leave YG now, they would be ruined because Blackpink's brand, what they are known and popular for is literally created by YG. 5)YG not allowing Blackpink ANY creative freedom is just an excuse by blinks to justify their lack of musical input. Every time someone says Blackpink does not make their own music blinks get offended and say it is because YG does not allow them to. This makes absolutely no sense to me as every artist under Yg, male or female has taken part of and been credited for their music. CL, Lee Hi, AKMU, even Somi who has been part of the company for only 2 years has been part of all her songs. I know Jennie said she has written a lot but that does not necessarily mean it was good enough to make it into the final cut. Have Blackpink members themselves said that they aren\u2019t allowed to make music? Where did you get this information from? I will never get why fans get offended when it is completely okay that BP doesn\u2019t make their music. 6)They are heavily privileged. Yes, the girls are talented but idols from smaller companies with more talent and hard work are nowhere near as successful. Blackpink was the first girl group by YG after 2ne1, legends in the Kpop scene and they were marketed well and immediately got success from debut because of it. Their first song and they were breaking records but being from a big3 company is what brought them a lot of attention. 7)Their chemistry is awkward. This one is just based on observation but I don\u2019t think the girls are as close as people make them be. Even their personalities seem forced to an EXTENT and yes it\u2019s all the Kpop ploy to be perfect and YG definitely plays a part in it. Their group chemistry does not seem very strong to me overall. 8)They are aware of everything. I find it really hard to believe that with three out of the four girls being fluent in English and mainly having an international fanbase they would be unaware of everything. Jennie being biased by YG, Rose is the most mistreated, Jisoo being the most underrated, these are such popular opinions that even people outside the fandom know them and I am pretty sure the girls are aware of all. I also don\u2019t think it is possible to not be affected by such things and it probably put a strain on their group dynamic. Again, before anyone gets offended this is simply my opinion based on observation. 9)Jenkai probably broke up because of YG. Honestly, they did not get as much hate for their relationship as Krystal and Kai did and it was overall well accepted by fans and the public. It makes no sense to me why they would break up just months after for no reason and I feel YG was behind it. ",
