            "answer_text": "they didn\u2019t want me to tell you this- but i think i don\u2019t have a heart to not tell u this. BTS is actually at my house. So that you understand it, i\u2019ll just tell you what they\u2019re doing rn. Jungkook is sobbing and lying against the wall drinking giant last banana milk. We speculated what could be the reason and realized that he could actually be on his period. Jin won\u2019t stop from telling us all his mind blessings dad jokes he knows- and with all i mean all. omg, it\u2019s becoming so annoying. even Jimin stopped to laugh. Yoongs went to a hotel a few kilometers away so he won\u2019t be able to have a incredibly annoying Suckjin with a incredibly breath taking windshield laugh. Just imagine how much he actually had to piss him off to move Yoongi from his spot. He probably will be taking a \u201cnap\u201d for the next 52 hours. I hope i\u2019ll get to see him again. Taehyung just decided to hug us all from behind because he wanted, so sweet. Now, he\u2019s crying over some random Yeontan pictures he took. He said he dedicates now Winter Bear to him, when he actually said that that song was for me. So so so mean \ud83d\ude24 i think he would turn gay for this dog, if he actually isn\u2019t yet. Hobi\u2026 i\u2019m somehow relieved that he also got annoyed by Jin. He won\u2019t speak (scream) in a incredibly volume anymore because he is so sick of the non stopping wild shield laugh. Believe me or not Armys, Jin can suck. Anyways, he\u2019s listening to some Hip Hop band and just dizzing off, i think, what is a very rare view to observe, since he is the energy fullest man in the universe. Forgot to mention that. Yoongi said something to Jin that none of us did hear, but it was something that apparently scared him as fuck, so he stopped with his kill attempts. I\u2019m grateful, but also worried if he blackmailed him. And worried why he still went to that hotel instead of just saying at the dorm, when it was finally quiet. Joonie is sharing with Sunshine headphones. What should I say more. Probably thinking of math terms or why Jungkook choosed socks with red circles and blue background instead of these with the blue circles and red background. At last but not least, Chimchim. We\u2019re a happy couple since about one month. That crackhead thought his contract said that he isn\u2019t allowed to date. He is and as good as always was, not including the three years after debut. Bangpd only said that he doesn\u2019t recommend it since as good as anybody knows him. He didn\u2019t know the contract he signed in, but when you think about it, it\u2019s not very surprising, since he also forgot his lyrics two hours before performing. Anyways, we\u2019re lying on the floor and my head on his chest. I love love love this position, you have the most beautiful and cute view from here. And I\u2019m also happy that I was able to date him and he to love me back, even if he knew my love for him wasn\u2019t ever real and I was just a psycho saesang fan and only was a fan girl, he still felt loved somehow. So you have of course a chance to date one of them. I just asked them and they\u2019re all fine with it. Ah, you could go to the hotel were Yoongi\u2019s. It\u2019s in the fuckery avenue 285 A, South Korea, Busan. He is right now there, but I dunno if he will stay there, so hurry. Hope I could help you \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc95(to realize where the limits of being an Army are.) ",
