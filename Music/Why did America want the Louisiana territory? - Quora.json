            "answer_text": "What President Thomas Jefferson wanted were rights to use the Mississippi River and the Port of New Orleans for trade--at the time all French territory. American merchants and farmers in the new states of Kentucky and Tennessee, as well as the Ohio and Northwest territories, had to go east, over the Appalachians, to reach U.S. seaports, or north into British North America (Canada) to the St. Lawrence River. The Ohio River was U.S. territory but only as far as the French-controlled Mississippi.This was three decades before the railroads came along so virtually all trade was along rivers.Jefferson sent James Monroe, his secretary of state and later president himself, to Paris to negotiate trade rights with Napoleon.Early on in the talks, the story goes, Monroe quoted some fairly generous financial offer, to which Napoleon replied something along the lines of \"Oh heck, I'll SELL you the whole thing for that much money!\" Monroe, reportedly, almost fell out of his chair but took the offer.Napoleon saw a great deal for himself. He was up to his earlobes fighting the British and Prussians and needed money\u2014fast\u2014to keep his army going. Also, he had just lost Haiti and there was the very real danger that the British would attack New Orleans, which was lightly defended. Napoleon didn't have troops to spare so New France was more of a liability than an asset. Voila! Sell it to the Americans, get some cash out of the deal and get rid of a potential big problem.Sure enough, the deal of a lifetime was a bitter issue in Congress and there was significant opposition to approving the deal. The worry was the U.S. was getting a pig in a poke. Why did Napoleon want to sell? Did he know something Congress didn't? What was out there? Did the still newbie U.S. have the resources necessary? Thus Lewis & Clark, who originally were to check into things in connection with the trade-rights offer to Napoleon, suddenly had a new mission. But that's another story. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually, in 1803, President Jefferson just sent his Secretary of State James Monroe to the French leader Napoleon to purchase the port of New Orleans to give a place for Mississippi River area traders and farmers a place to trade their goods to other places in the USA and outside the United States. After Haitian leader Toussaint L\u2019Overture defeated the French forces in Haiti, Napoleon gave up interests in North America. He wanted to focus on defeating his rival in Europe namely Great Britain. When Monroe offered to buy New Orleans from the French, the French countered the offer by offering the entire Louisiana Territory for about $15 million. The term Manifest Destiny was created in 1844 by John L O\u2019Sullivan. ",
