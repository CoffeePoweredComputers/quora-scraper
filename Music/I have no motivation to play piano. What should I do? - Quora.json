            "answer_text": "I am motivated by all sorts of things: Curiosity. What does this piece sound like? If I hear a recording, do I like what I hear, or could I do it better (at least for my own ears)? What makes the music tick - why does it affect me in certain ways when I hear it played? What makes it beautiful? Does it have hidden beauties that I don\u2019t hear when I simply hear others play it? Why did the guy write it? Does it have a story to tell? Can I understand its procedure - how it moves and breathes the musical ideas?A goal, such as to play beautiful music for others. Becoming good at music has enabled me to play at church, with others in concerts and a few solo concerts. It helps me to write music, which has resulted in hundreds of songs and music dramas, which I couldn\u2019t do if I had not practiced to learn how to play the piano well.I want to be able to help people sing - at a public school, where teenagers are just beginning to learn the craft of singing. Or at community theatre, where the need for live music creates a lot of reason to practice.I love to help old people sing at the rest home, simply by playing my own arrangements of show tunes and oldies, made up from a fake book and my knowledge of style, which comes by a sort of practicing (just having fun trying to imitate popular styles).Now, as a \u201cveteran\u201d (60 years of playing piano and organ), practice means mostly learning the pieces along with others. I am too busy helping others to do my own concerts - but it is rewarding in many ways.Many, many years ago I was done with the thing of sitting in a room at a regular time. The only reason I did that at college was that the practice room was shared, so you had to sign up for a slot. But when I really wanted to practice, I came back to the room at 10:00 PM, and then the world was mine.",

            "answer_text": "First of all, know that everyone struggles with motivation from time to time, and it is completely normal to become frustrated with practicing. For me personally, the most important thing is remembering my goal. Why am I working on this piece? Is it because I love how it sounds and want to be able to play it? If so, I go to YouTube and listen to professionals play the piece and re-fall in love with the music itself. Remember, however, that the people playing these pieces have likely been playing for many years and have practiced that piece over and over again before performing or recording it, so manage your expectations carefully. If your goal is to be able to play the piece well but maybe not at a concert level, for example, perhaps you don\u2019t have to aim for the highest tempo. The point is to get back to enjoying the music itself and keeping that end goal in mind. Maybe you just want to have something to play for people to show you know how to play piano, or maybe your teacher assigned the piece. Whatever the reason is, it is a good idea to write down that goal and place it near the piano so you can look at it as a reminder when you\u2019re feeling unmotivated. If your teacher assigned you a piece that you don\u2019t particularly like, realize that he or she probably assigned it for a specific reason, i.e. it\u2019s a classic in piano repertoire or it teaches a specific technique. In that case, think of it as a stepping stone for something you do want to play. If you are unsure, ask your teacher! Most teachers would be happy to explain their reasons for assigning a piece and are there to help you with any practicing hangups you may have with it. Another important thing to remember is that you don\u2019t have to do one big practice session. Oftentimes it\u2019s actually better to break up your practicing into smaller, more manageable sessions such as 15 or 30 minutes, depending on your level. Or maybe just focus on learning 1 page or even 1 phrase before moving on. Writing down how much time you spent practicing is also a great tool, as it allows you to not only take stalk of how much you time you are actually putting into the piece and can give you a sense of accomplishment after each session. It also helps your teacher see the amount of work you\u2019ve put into something each week, which can make it easier for he or she to help you move past your hangups. For example, say you go to your lesson and are not playing as well as you would have at home (this is very common). This can be frustrating but do know that your teacher is likely not expecting perfection and is instead looking for progress. Having a record of how much you practiced can help you and him/her to adjust your practicing habits if needed to ensure greater success. I often ask my students to record their practice, and many of them find it helpful and affirming. Also, sometimes the best thing to do is to take a break, even if that sounds counterintuitive. Sometimes we need to step away from things for a bit and view it again later with fresh eyes and ears. That could be later that day or tomorrow or whenever, or it could also mean playing a different piece for a little bit, such as one you enjoy or already know, just to remind yourself why you play piano in the first place. It can also be good to go back and play something that might have been hard for you when you were learning it but is easier now to show that you\u2019ve made it through difficult practices before and therefore can do it again. Finally, remember that even if you have all the musical talent and ability in the world, nothing can replace hard work and repetition. Part of the point of practicing is to train your hands to know the notes better so you can find them faster and more easily. Just like any other muscle in the body, you have to consistently do your exercises to keep that muscle in shape. So don\u2019t get down on yourself too much and do know that even the greatest talents had and have to practice! Hope this helps! ",
