            "answer_text": "How much does spotify pay per 1000 streams is a compicated question. He previously about 150 monthly listeners on Spotify (no I didn\u2019t forget a zero) with merely 45 followers, about 1,500 followers on Instagram and Facebook. And was making significantly less than $100 per month from his music. By using the software aiobot, you can increase your plays and streams fast , thus you get lots of thousands streams on Spotify.  Fast forward to today, 3 years later, he now has 500,000 monthly listeners on Spotify (no my finger didn\u2019t get stuck on the zero key), over 50,000 followers on Spotify, 245,000 Likes on Facebook, 100,000 followers on Instagram, he\u2019s making your way around 5 million streams per month, has over 100 million total streams across all platforms and is also making around $20,000 per month just from his recorded music. There\u2019s no denying that Spotify has changed the music industry forever. Within an industry where piracy was increasing thanks to famous brands file sharing websites, Spotify has somehow were able to turn into a multibillion-dollar company while legally offering songs free of charge. Very much like click farms that contain become popular lately, Spotify in addition has been suffering from fake listeners and streaming farms who've been stealing advertiser\u2019s money without them even realising. Not merely is this defrauding advertisers out of millions, but it\u2019s also even affecting some official chart results! Conclusion, you can make more thousands streams on spotify with the software of spotify .Good Luck! ",
