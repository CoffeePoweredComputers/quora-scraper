            "answer_text": "All I can say about the subject is this: G\u00f3recki's Fourth was scheduled to be premiered by the London Philharmonic Orchestra with Robert McDuffie as a soloist (the Glass Violin Concerto No. 2) and conductor Matirn Alsop, on Saturday, April 17, 2010, in the Royal Festival Hall in London (along with premieres by Philip Glass and Mark-Anthony Turnage), but was postponed because of the composer's illness and subsequent death (the work was commissioned by the London Philharmonic Orchestra and the Southbank Centre in London, the Lons Angeles Philharmonic with Gustavo Dudamel as Music Director, and the ZaterdagMatinee, Dutch radio's classical music concert series in the Amsterdam Concertgebouw). Essentially G\u00f3recki wasn't able to finish the composition on time for this premiere and the program was modified to include his Symphoy No. 3 with soprano Joanna Wos. G\u00f3recki was very nit-picky when it came to his compositions. He revised them for years on end and always took too much attention to detail before handing in a manuscript to his editors, Boosey & Hawkes. An official statement was made by B&H stating that they had not received any manuscript before his death, which leads us to assume that his family stil holds all (if any) manuscripts of these and other unfinished works. You can read the obituary published by Boosey here http://www.boosey.com/cr/news/12094 and find on the bottom of the page links to other obits published in The Guardian, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Times, and others. Some of them mention his 4th in one way or the other, but no specifics about when it will be performed. The work is still unfinished, and it will probably stay that way. Luckily we have his 3rd Symphony to enjoy. ",

            "answer_text": "Gorecki produced a detailed sketch of the entire symphony in reduced form for piano before he died. His own son was tasked with completing the orchestration. The work is now considered complete, has been performed several times, and is available to hear on an album released by Nonesuch Records. I had the good fortune to make it to the U.S. premiere. It's an absolutely astonishing piece of music and capstone on Gorecki\u2019s career. As another answer suggested, it's also a much tougher piece of work than his famous 3rd symphony, so brace yourself. Here are program notes archived from the performance I attended: Symphony No. 4 (U.S. premiere, LA Phil commission) Review of the concert: Henryk G\u00f3recki's quirky, final major musical statement NPR review of the Nonesuch recording: Review: Henryk G\u00f3recki, Symphony No. 4, 'Tansman Episodes' ",
