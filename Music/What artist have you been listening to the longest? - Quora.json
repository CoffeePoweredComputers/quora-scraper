            "answer_text": "For a band that has continued to make music for years\u2026 I would have to say U2 has showed up in my playlists and radios time and time again.   According to https://www.independent.ie, U2 has been declared the longest running band, beating Radiohead, another one of my favorites, by about 7 years. The article continues to say U2 also defeated The Rolling Stones because their original lineup has never faltered in the time they have been performing. \u201cThe group are also in the Guinness Book of Records for their haul of 22 Grammy awards which is the most for any group in history. They also have an impressive haul of eight Brit Awards, a Golden Globe as well as many others.\u201d(Kelleher) Here\u2019s 3 of my favorites, each in a different year: One, 1991: Song for Someone, 2014: Love is Bigger Than Anything in It\u2019s Way, 2018: The article link: Sorry Mick Jagger... U2 named longest running band, by your magazine namesake ",

Jamie is the girl i loved and i will always love her. also, sorry if that sounded gay, im bi lol ",
