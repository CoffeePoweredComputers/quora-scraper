            "answer_text": "Caprice 1 and caprice 24,they both were extremely popular ik,but dont judge me,they own has they own melody, Caprice 1:The piece itself makes me feel happy,i thought that Paganini wrote this in a happy way,but still on hard mode. Caprice 24:This caprice kinda wrotes of someones feeling,started with an A minor,it truly feels like someone is gonna be crushed by his violin skills,Also at the pizz part,it truly shows how Paganini can push his limits,back then none can plays that pizz part,even the note writer cant write it while hearing Paganini doing it. But Paganini sold himself to the devil,so,no wonder his pieces are enjoyable. ",
