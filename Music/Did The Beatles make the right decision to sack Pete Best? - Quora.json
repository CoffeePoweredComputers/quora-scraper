            "answer_text": "There are different ways to consider the question, depending on what you mean by \u201cright.\u201d Ultimately, though, if they didn\u2019t have faith in him or his membership in the band made them doubt their future\u2026then yes, they made the proper choice\u2014even if they didn\u2019t carry it out in the best way. From a career standpoint: Producer George Martin expressed doubts about Pete\u2019s playing in the studio. (But never intended Best to be fired. He thought the band could use a different studio drummer and Pete could continue to play live and remain a member of the band.) When the Beatles heard Martin\u2019s reservation\u2014they acted and fired him (or had their manager fire him.) Why?Context: The Beatles were turned down by just about every record company in England. So, in some respects, the band viewed their opportunity with Martin as close to a \u201clast shot.\u201d Keep in mind, too, that at that time, Martin wasn\u2019t some bigshot\u2014he was known for making comedy records and was essentially \u201ctaking a flyer\u201d on the group. He wasn\u2019t offering them a 3-record deal\u2026just a chance to record a few tracks and explore the band\u2019s potential. The band wanted to maximize this opportunity\u2026So from a career standpoint, firing Best, though not necessary, would, in their minds, offer them the strongest opportunity to give it everything they had. Who knows if they\u2019d get another shot like this? So they wanted to get it right\u2026ORMartin gives them an out: Perhaps their motives were personal. Consider this: The band had used several drummers over the years\u2026and essentially Pete, according to Lennon, was there out of basic necessity rather than his innate skill or close relationship with he, Paul or George. Pete was said to be moody, wasn\u2019t \u201carty\u201d or progressive, resisted group activities.(e.g. didn\u2019t get the new Beatles haircut). He wasn\u2019t unfriendly but, according to accounts, kept himself a bit separate from the rest of the band. On those occasions when he couldn\u2019t make a performance, Ringo filled in. The band liked Starr and grew close to him. Starr was also one of, if not the, most experienced drummers in Liverpool. Harrison, in particular, wanted him in the band\u2026So, when Martin suggested Pete might not fit the bill\u2026it gave the band the excuse/opportunity to replace Pete with a friend and a musical upgrade.Could\u2019ve Been Handled Better So, you can understand WHY the band made the decision\u2014a musical upgrade, get a actual friend in the band, and Martin\u2019s opinion reinforced their fears about missing out professionally/needing to get Ringo. And let\u2019s face it, bands are built around musical ability\u2014AND personal chemistry\u2026Each member of a band doesn\u2019t HAVE to be a virtuoso at their craft to be successful\u2026but they must enjoy playing together. They can be successful if they don\u2019t like each other\u2014but they won\u2019t be built to last. Likewise, it won\u2019t be fun. Bands get rid of talented members all the time\u2014simply b/c they don\u2019t get along or they like someone else more. (Heck, Stu Sutcliffe couldn\u2019t really play, but he was a friend, could afford a bass, and so he was in.) So, it\u2019s common for bands to remove members for less than Pete was removed for. It\u2019s also common for 21 year-old young men to not always be the most sensitive or courageous during these sort of separations. Truth be told, Pete\u2019s removal from the band says more about McCartney, Lennon and Harrison, their ambition or fondness for Ringo, than it may about Best\u2019s musical ability. Was it right? Sure. The band wanted to play with someone else, they thought getting someone else would enhance their ability to make records and kickstart a more successful musical career. Could they have handled it better? You bet. But they handled it in a fairly typical way for guys of their age. Again, I\u2019m not saying that Pete was/is a poor drummer, bad guy, or deserved what happened to him. Just saying that folks get replaced in bands all of the time for a host of reasons\u2014many times for reasons that make little sense. Other than personal whim. Here, the band made the decision for reasons that seem justifiable\u2014whether you consider the question personally or professionally. ",

            "answer_text": "Musically speaking, it was the best decision: Pete was an honest amateur, the kind of drummer you can deal with when you want to play with friends, but he was nowhere near professional proficiency. Ringo on the other hand was, by far, the best drummer in Liverpool. And although it's been a recurring joke ever since to despise his skills, it's one professional drummers never do, for it's widely recognised that despite his lack of frills, he's one of the best song drummers who ever was; meaning that his drumming has always been perfectly adapted to the song, moving with it, and bringing every part out. On the opposite, Pete was capable of a decent 4 beats, but outdide of providing that foundation, never really interacted with the other instruments. On a interpersonal level, it was an even better decision : the success of the Beatles wasn't just about their music, but their collective charm and the way they interacted with one another was what tipped them over from successful musical act to cultural phenomenon, and Ringo meshed with the others in a way Pete never did. Let's remember that they knew Ringo for a long time and always had great fun with him, whereas Pete Best, while never being anything else but a nice guy and a very decent human being, always kept to himself and never was part of the multi-head hydra the Beatles were on and off stage. Now, the way they handled it was shitty. Whereas I've always been impressed by how much of a grown up Pete Best has always been publicly in interviews and all. But a clue as to whether it was a good idea or not is to look at how John, Paul, George and Pete were a struggling -about to throw the towel, really- little group in a downtrodden city, when John, Paul, George and Ringo went on to become the greatest musical act ever.

            "answer_text": "I want to say yes, but there was a lot more to the Beatles than the music. For instance, their movies and independent films, theirs and others, showed us then and now, who they were and what we expected of them. More importantly, what we would have missed from Ringo being out of the equation and Pete being in the equation. Let me give some examples. Ringo accepted his \u201cThis Boy\u201d role (think Hard Days Night) in stride and didn't compete for a stronger personality. How do you think that Pete Best would have approached this? People don't search for the \u201cButt Boy*\u201d personality, they usually fall into that role because they might not be maintain a more witty or forceful role. As the last Beatle, he naturally fits into that. But what about Pete's role? That's somewhat of a mystery. Would Pete be the \u201csad this boy or the butt boy? Something tells me that he would competed the witty leading role. He would have gotten sacked in front of the millions of fans. That would have been really bad for the band's popularity. We also know that some Liverpulian fans, let's assume female, thought that Pete was the best or maybe cutest Beatle. We suspect that even John was envious of Paul's cuteness. If Paul was all of a sudden the second cutest? Would that have affected his output? Possibly. In conclusion, I think that the George Harrison, Paul McCartney, and John Lennon weren't right in sacking Pete Best. Without a doubt.

            "answer_text": "Yes, unequivocally. There are a couple of reasons. First, Pete didn\u2019t fit in with the group. He wouldn\u2019t comb his hair forward and adopt The Beatles\u2019 hairstyle (in 1962, he wore his hair in the pompadour style that was popular in the late 1950s) and he was rather sullen. He didn\u2019t interact with the other three well at all. Second, and more important, he simply couldn\u2019t play the drums very well. If you listen to The Beatles\u2019 Anthology, and the Decca audition specifically, then it\u2019s readily apparent that Pete cannot stay in time very well. It\u2019s actually embarrassing to listen to. Pete\u2019s playing was so bad that George Martin, The Beatles\u2019 record producer, told Brian Epstein, their manager, that he didn\u2019t care what Brian did with Pete onstage, but when it came time to record in the studio, George would have a session drummer sitting in. That\u2019s why there are two versions of \u201cLove Me Do\u201d: one with Ringo (who had just joined the band) and one with session drummer Andy White (which was recorded first but never issued since it was clear that Ringo could actually play the drums very well). Ringo was everything The Beatles needed: A topflight drummer with a sense of humor who got on well with everyone and was willing to conform to The Beatles\u2019 look. Ringo was also a fan favorite. Of all The Beatles, Ringo received the most mail. I suspect it\u2019s because he seemed the most normal and approachable. In a group of supermen songwriters like John Lennon and Paul McCartney and an innovative and influential guitarist like George Harrison, Ringo Starr was an \u201ceveryman\u201d with whom the fans could identify. I think The Beatles could have handled the sacking of Pete better than they did (they tasked Brian Epstein with doing their dirty work). But Pete ultimately got residuals from the Anthology, so he made a lot of money (millions as I understand) in the end. ",

            "answer_text": "In George Martin\u2019s memoir, All You Need Is Ears, he said this about his first meeting with The Beatles: \u201cI remember George Harrison being the most talkative at that first meeting, and Pete Best not saying a word throughout that whole afternoon. But he did have the advantage of being the handsomest of the group. His drumming, on the other hand, was not good. At the end of the test (the audition), I took Brian (Epstein) to one side and said, \u2018I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to do with the group as such, but this drumming isn\u2019t good enough for what I want. It isn\u2019t regular enough. It doesn\u2019t give the right kind of sound. If we do make a record, I\u2019d much prefer to have my own drummer \u2014 which won\u2019t make any difference to you, because no one will know who\u2019s on the record anyway.\u2019 What I didn\u2019t realize at the time was that the group already wanted Pete Best out and Ringo Starr in, and that my remarks were something in the nature of a last straw.\u201d The accounts I\u2019ve read describe Best as a drummer of very limited skills who had trouble with basic tasks like keeping a steady beat. It sounds to me like the decision to remove Best was the right thing to do. ",

            "answer_text": "I really can\u2019t say. We weren\u2019t there and all we can do now is go by is history and make our best guess (no pun). I like(d) them fine with the Fab Four that I have come to know. I have a hard time picturing it any different. For me, that\u2019s the historical part. Even when George left and John said \u201cScrew it. We\u2019ll get Eric.\u201d I believe that in no way did he picture a band without George. He was saying \u2018Nothing shall stop this train!\u2019 I read for the first time today about Pete Best\u2019s \u201cmoodiness.\u201d Again, whether it\u2019s true or not, who knows? What I feel in my heart, is this- Although it really didn\u2019t become apparent until a good time later, Paul and John really liked the spotlight on them (individually! LOL!). And they weren\u2019t really keen on sharing it- with each other, or even with George. They were a competitive lot, and that fact probably has a bunch to do with why we have so many wonderful songs (and Honey Pie!). Whether that goes all the way back to the fans cheering for Pete who was sitting way in the back behind them, I couldn\u2019t say. But it does kinda figure into it logically. Plus, the sense of humor and personalities that they had were just really something special. And I could see that if something didn\u2019t fit nicely into that template, that it would just be out of place and would have to go. Add those all up and you then have poor Brian Epstein having to take a ride on his own to pass on the news to Pete that, he too, should \u2018take a ride on his own.\u2019 My God, how haunting this all must be for him. And yes, he did attempt suicide. It\u2019s hard to imagine not thinking that way when you were thisclose to being the biggest thing in the world. And then suddenly, with a word, you were not. ",

            "answer_text": "Sadly yes. They didn\u2019t have the rapport with Pete Best that made them The Beatles that became famous. Yes Pete Best had fans. He was popular in his own town that people came to the same venues to see them on a regular basis. People can comment in today\u2019s world about John and Paul. But what made the Beatles famous was the four of them. It was not just their music it was thier charisma. We were just kids we didn\u2019t understand at first that they were musical geniuses. Beatlemania was John, Paul, George and Ringo. The other thing is I\u2019ve heard many people say that Pete Best was not the drummer that Ringo is. Now you\u2019ve heard musician after musician interviewed that will say this. And I think it speaks for itself that he quit drumming professionally. Ringo would\u2019ve played drums if he had to play in a bar. So I just think he wasn\u2019t a Beatle that\u2019s all. He received millions later. I think he earned 8 million. Which is a lot of money look at us some longtime musicians. 8 and 10 million is an average unless you\u2019re a superstar musician. Out of curiosity I checked his net worth. And he was down to 800,000. ",

            "answer_text": "At that time of 1962, John, Paul and George took a big chance firing Pete Best as he was a very popular member of the Beatles. I believe history writes that the local fans were angered by the change of drummers and even boycotted the Beatles for awhile. That it didn\u2019t hurt the group more was simply the timing of the change. EMI had signed them based on the expectations of John and Paul\u2019s ability to write songs. The expectations were not based whether the drummer was Pete, Ringo or even Andy White. As history records, George Martin didn\u2019t think much of Ringo or Pete\u2019s ability to drum which is how Andy White gets his place in the Beatle story. It could have very well ended up John, Paul, George and Andy!! In hindsight, John, Paul and George made the right decision in that Ringo was able to hold his own as a personality and generate as much of a following as Pete ever had. However, the odd thing (for me) is history writes that one reason Pete was fired was because he was very popular (more so than Paul and Paul didn\u2019t like that). Yet Ringo ended being very popular yet Paul doesn\u2019t seem to have a problem with Ringo. Maybe that story is more myth than reality. Anyhow, by 1995, Pete ended up getting a nice chunk of change from the anthology project. Granted it didn\u2019t make him as wealthy as the others but he became a millionaire nonetheless. ",

Pete best was a adequate drummer good enough to go to hamburg with them when they needed a drummer and he had a drum kit which was hard to obtain in those days and also the cashbah club which his Mother owned where the Beatles played at that time. It turned out when he missed a few gigs and Ringo sat in that he had more of a feel with his type of drumming Ringo was left-handed which was rare back then for a drummer and was just a better overall time keeper and drummer than Pete Best. He was good looking for that era but I think that's a minor reason if any why the Beatles sacked him. It came down the drumming ability and Ringo was just a better player overall so yes the Beatles made the right decision. ",

That issue, to spell it out, is simply this \u201chow could The Beatles have gotten it so wrong\u201d. I mean, there they were in the early 60\u2019s - a promising career ahead of them and what do our clever little Beatles do - they go and sack Pete Best. You have to steady yourself when you see it written down - how could they possibly think that sacking Pete was a good thing; but I suppose hindsight is 20:20 vision. Sure, if they hadn't sacked Pete they probably could have been great, maybe even have made a difference or cast some influence over the 20th century. OK, they had Pepper, Revolver, Let It Be, White Album, Rubber Soul, Abbey Road but the sad thing is that they could have mattered. They could have really mattered. The Beatles could have mattered man. But they decided to sack Pete Best and threw it all away. Now they, and the rest of the world, will have to live with the consequences of that shocking decision. We all have to live in a world where The Beatles sacked Pete Best. It's hard to wrap your head around it, I know. I've been struggling with it myself for 30 years. How could The Beatles have got it so wrong? ",

            "answer_text": "Unequivocally, the best (pun intended) decision The Beatles ever made was replacing Pete with Ringo Starr. It was cowardly, mishandled, and unfortunate for Pete, but as John Lennon observed (and I\u2019m paraphrasing) Pete was a great drummer, Ringo was a great Beatle. When you watch Anthology both George and Paul comment on the difference when Ringo took over the drummer\u2019s throne. Paul identifies Ringo as capable of playing What I\u2019d Say (a beat he would adapt to considerable effect on I Feel Fine) and George simply that from the moment Ringo joined it felt right. And without being too critical, all the surviving evidence indicates Pete\u2019s drumming was amateurish, clunky, and sub-standard. He may have improved, but it\u2019s unlikely that he would ever evolved at the same pace, and George Martin was adamant he would not be playing on the recordings at any rate. Ringo offered the perfect foil and complement as a personality. As a player he was the most accomplished in the band until the others caught in in 1965. Some in Liverpool never forgave them, and it may appear unseemly and capricious that Pete was fired just before they hit it big, but make no mistake: Pete Best was never going to be the drummer that would make them the biggest band in the world.

            "answer_text": "Absolutely, for three very good reasons\u2026 First, and foremost, Pete was not a good drummer. Unlike John, Paul and George, he was uninterested in trying to improve his craft. He figured his rudimentary beat punctuated by flurries of bashing was good enough for the likes of the Cavern and the Star Club. When EMI producer George Martin signed the band but said that Best wasn\u2019t proficient enough to play on recordings, so Martin would hire a session drummer, there\u2019s no record of Pete having been offended or concerned. He\u2019d still earn a quarter of the band\u2019s earnings without having to contribute to their recordings whatsoever. Secondly, his relationship with the other three Beatles had deteriorated to the point where they were professional partners, but not friends. There had been a greater degree of closeness between them all in their early forays to Hamburg, when they were essentially alone in the German city and they depended on one another for support (and mutual protection from local toughs), but by the latter half of 1962 they had drifted fairly far apart, to the point where after performances, Lennon, McCartney and Harrison would head for a local pub, and Best would hook up with friends to go elsewhere. If you aren\u2019t even interested in raising a pint with your bandmates after a show, then you aren\u2019t really interested in them at all. Lastly, Pete\u2019s mother, Mona Best, had been serving as the group\u2019s booking agent and quasi-manager prior to the arrival of Brian Epstein. Even after Brian became their official manager, Mona continued to book regional shows for the band, and she also saw fit to pepper Epstein with suggestions and unasked for advice; it got to the point where the otherwise unflappable Brian could no longer stand to talk with her. But still she persisted in trying to exert some degree of control over the Beatles. And more ominously still, she was about to give birth to the son of Pete\u2019s best friend\u2026and the group\u2019s road manager\u2026Neil Aspinall. It was an open secret among fans in Liverpool, and it threatened to be a controversial embarrassment for the Beatles should it become more widely known\u2026one that could conceivably derail their recording contract with the very staid and conservative EMI. So it should come as no surprise that the band sacked Pete; it would have been a shock (and a huge mistake) if they didn\u2019t. If any of them had any regrets about it later, it was perhaps in the way they had done it: John, Paul and George all made themselves scarce one afternoon, and they left it to Brian Epstein to lower the boom. At the very least, I think, Pete deserved to hear it from them that he was out. ",

On the other side, the others got along great with Ringo and it was made easier for them when it came down to the fact that Best could only play fours and Lennon in particular used to have to stomp his feet really loudly in order to keep Best in time during live shows. It was the right decision for them. ",

I spent decades believing that Pete was shafted due to personal jealousy, his upstaging the others with his good looks, his failure to be sufficiently pals with the other three, not adopting the hairstyle etc. However, it is pretty clear that he wasn\u2019t a good drummer, at least not good enough for a group that was otherwise performing at the level the other three were. That\u2019s plain to see on his recordings with The Beatles. Ringo, on the other hand, who was often portrayed earlier on as a mediocre drummer who got in because of the personal stuff with Pete and Ringo\u2019s own fitting in with the band, is now, it is generally recognized Ringo as top notch and especially good as a Beatle. Maybe Pete has gotten better in the decades that followed as is testified in some of the other answers, but in 1962, he wasn\u2019t up to snuff. ",

Pete Best is not a bad drummer, I\u2019ve personally seen him perform live with his band. His band is excellent. There were other reasons personal in nature. Pete played all through the Hamburg gigs and the band was good enough to get their first recording contract through Brian Epsteins efforts. Bottom line is that the Beatles would have been just as successful regardless of who was playing drums. There is no right or wrong decision here. People try to read to much into all of this. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes they certainly did. Pete was a good drummer, in that he could keep a beat, but he had no imagination. A great drummer is one who can take the rhythm of the song and transform it using different parts of the drum set, not just the snare and hi-hat, as well as different styles. Could Pete have come up with the hi-hat tom roll combination of \u201cCome Together\u201d, or the clanging cacophony on \u201cEverybody\u2019s Got Something To hide Except For Me And My Monkey\u201d? I think not. And it;s not a question of whether those things were technically proficient. It\u2019s that Ringo could look at a song and could tell what it needed percussion wise, just as George could do with the lead guitar parts. Another thing that made Ringo a perfect fit for the band was the Beatles were more than just a band in the early days, they were a gang. It was all for one and one for all. However, Pete never hung out with them off stage, yet Ringo would, although he was the drummer for Rory Storme and the Hurricanes. Last but not least, people make a big deal about George Martin having a studio drummer play on the Beatles\u2019 first recording, but that had nothing to do with Ringo\u2019s ability. When Martin contracted the Beatles, Pete was their drummer. When they come in for their session, Pete is out and Ringo is in. Ringo was unproven as far as Martin was concerned, and he wasn\u2019t about to take any chances. ",

As George Martin has said, Ringo was a human metronome. He was exactly the final piece of the puzzle to Beatlemania. The rest of the band were attractive enough, creative songwriters, and great vocalists. They just needed someone to keep the beat, hence The Beatles. ",

They might have found a kinder way of doing it, but there is no way Pete would have been able to keep up with the rest of the band in terms of musical and creative development, and even if he had managed to hold his own on the first few albums(George Martin didn\u2019t think he was good enough to play in the recording studio, though he was fine with Pete continuing to play with them live)they would almost certainly have had to fire him sometime between late 1965 and early 1966-there\u2019s no way he could have played at the level Ringo played at on Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper, the White Album, Let it Be or Abbey Road. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. The simple truth is, Ringo Starr was a much better drummer than Pete Best, and if you listen to the Decca demo tape they made with Best and the early EMI material they cut with Ringo, the difference is dramatic. It\u2019s also worth noting that George Martin, who signed the band to EMI and produced nearly all of their recordings, told the band before their first session that he was going to use a different drummer for recording because Pete wasn\u2019t cutting it. Ringo had already played with the band by that point on gigs that Pete didn\u2019t want to do, and they thought Ringo was a better drummer who better suited their music. That was the final straw that led the band to fire Pete and bring in Ringo. I seriously doubt the Beatles would have enjoyed anything close to their remarkable success with Best at the drum kit. ",

Pete kept to himself most of the time even while the women screamed for him and loved him. George Martin wasn\u2019t keen on Pete\u2019s chops and I think that expert opinion gave credence to the other three Beatles and their gut instincts. Plus Ringo was the coolest with the outwardly positive attitude. And he\u2019s a solid, solid drummer with a heavy kick drum and snapping snare, which was imperative to keep time in live concert before a modern PA and monitor system. I\u2019m my opinion, Ringo\u2019s kick/snare combo and little use of an open high hat was influential on early hip hop influences. ",

Nobody would remember the names \u201cJohn, Paul, George, and Pete\u201d or \u201cJohn, Paul, George, and Richard\u201d. At the time they first started to become big, the nickname \u201cRingo\u201d attached to the other three was perfect. It also didn\u2019t hurt that he was a little silly and marketed as such. Everybody remembered \u201cJohn, Paul, George, and Ringo\u201d. That name Ringo was such a strange thing to add to the rather ordinary \u201cJohn, Paul, and George\u201d, that it made them memorable. I remembered when, as an 11 year old, I was convinced that CCR would be the next huge band, I thought I should remember their names (Tom, John, Doug, and Stu). It really took some effort. I didn\u2019t even accomplish it back then. I would try to remember and the names would slip away from my memory. But John, Paul, George, and Ringo? That was effortless. I sure they wouldn\u2019t have kept Ringo if he wasn\u2019t a talented drummer but his name was great accidental marketing. ",

I am guitarist, and no real expert on percussion, but even I can tell the difference between Pete Best and Ringo Starr\u2019s drumming. Pete\u2019s style, back then, was very loud, very staccato, not very creative, and often inconsistent. Ringo, on the other hand, kept a much tighter rhythm, and although his style was fairly understated. and unconventional, he was very adept at adding just the right touches, rifts and flourishes, when the situation called for it. George Martin had Best replaced with a session drummer on those early tracks, because his timing was, invariably, way off. I've always felt sorry for Peter for being so rudely and unceremoniously dumped, but the simple truth is that he wasn't good enough. ",

I think they would have been a good and very influential live band for a couple of years, performing rock\u2019n\u2019roll and Motown covers mixed with well-crafted original pop of their own before being eclipsed by a new wave of British bands inspired by them in about 1964.
