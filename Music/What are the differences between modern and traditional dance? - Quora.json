            "answer_text": "What we call \u2018traditional\u2019 dance is often \u2018old\u2019 styles, that did not evolve with the times. This is often coupled to \u2018old\u2019 styles of music that those dances were \u2018traditionally\u2019 danced to. The truth is that most \u2018modern\u2019 dance styles evolved out of those very same \u2018traditional\u2019 styles. Personally I prefer styles that evolve - but if that means staying the same for a long time, it just means they were solid to begin with. That said, the reason I prefer \u2018modern\u2019 dance styles, is that they tend to be more open to fusion and improvisation, which I both enjoy very much. Switch fluently between Tango and Lambada in the same piece? Count me in. Mix Cuban and L.A. styles in Salsa? Hell yeah! Throw some hip-hop moves into my Swing routine? You bet! So, there you have it. I prefer \u2018modern\u2019 dance styles. But I also love \u2018traditional\u2019 styles, as long as they\u2019re fun to dance, and I can appreciate the music. ",

            "answer_text": "I have looked at the answer you received from Raphael Alexis, but your question is cryptic to someone who is a professional dancer, yet does not work in social dances at all. Modern dance can be considered a style of dance which was a post ballet reaction that often has been considered beginning by the Isadora Duncan era influences and leading on to the post-war German Mary Wigwam and Kurt Jooss, then extending to Martha Graham and Merce Cunningham techniques in the 50s in the USA, Traditional dances can also mean ethnic and folk dances from various societies which have been passed on through the generations. Are you asking for personal preferences to which style is prefered in general, or do you mean (as Mr Alexis has stated), that you want to know personal preferences for different influences for social dances?
