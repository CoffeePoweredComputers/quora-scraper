            "answer_text": "He married her and remained faithful to her for nearly 30 years. He fornicated with her. He made her pregnant multiple times. They had three children together Mary, Stella and James. He also adopted her daughter Heather. He put her in his post Beatles band Wings. He lived life with her. When she was diagnosed with cancer he stood by her and helped her fight to beat it. *edit: I inadvertently left this out. She didn't beat it and when she died he mourned: end of edit*. He worshipped her as his lifemate. I'm sorry there are only positives here, if you are looking for some dramatic story that he beat and abused her you certainly picked the wrong couple. In an imperfect world their love was probably as close to perfect as you're likely to find.  ",
