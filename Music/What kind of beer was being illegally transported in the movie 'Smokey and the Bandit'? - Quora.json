            "answer_text": "Bandit and Snowman were transporting Coors Banquet Beer from Texarkana, Texas to Jonesboro, Georgia.  Smokey and the Bandit - Wikipedia In 1977, Coors was unavailable for sale east of Oklahoma. A 1974 Time magazine article explains why Coors was so coveted that one would be willing to pay the Bandit such a high price to transport it. Coors Banquet Beer had a brief renaissance as certain people sought it out for its lack of stabilizers and preservatives. The article says that future Vice President Gerald Ford hid it in his luggage after a trip to Colorado in order to take it back to Washington. President Dwight D. Eisenhower had a steady supply airlifted to Washington by the Air Force. Carl Yastrzemski of the Boston Red Sox would bring several cases back with him on the team plane, after playing opposing teams on the west coast, by stashing it in the team's equipment trunks. The article also mentions Frederick Amon, who smuggled it from Colorado to North Carolina and sold it for four times the retail price. The lack of additives and preservatives meant that Coors had the potential for spoiling in a week if it were not kept cold throughout its transportation and in storage at its destination. This explains the 28-hour deadline. ",
