            "answer_text": "The \u2018transport\u2019 is just the mechanical part of the player - the tray, platter and drive motor, and laser positioning mechanism. Everything needed to get a CD into the right position, spun up to speed and the laser moving over the surface to read the disk\u2019s data. The CD player contains a CD transport and other electronic (non moving) parts to make a complete unit. Most actual transports contain most of the electronics anyway, so in many cases all the player adds to the party is a fancy box around the whole thing plus a display and some buttons. ",
