            "answer_text": "It is possible. Though I would like to say that \u2018Autotune\u2019 feature may be used to rectify the mistakes a bad singer makes, it can also be used to fine tune some minor errors a good singer makes. Because sometimes, a good singer may have sung the entire song, or a particular verse, in a very good way, with a tiny bit of mistake in-between, which in terms of the time schedule of the studio working hours, cannot necessarily be given the required recording time again. So to save time, the \u2018Autotune\u2019 feature can be used only to adjust that particular flaw in an otherwise good sounding rendering. Also, in my personal experience, sometimes, over singing a particular verse or song many times over to make it perfect, often ends in getting worse. Professional artists, studio engineers and producers value time as much as the quality of the recording. So just because a little \u2018Autotune is saving time and money, they might not find any harm in using it. Also remember, nobody is perfect every time. So it is also possible that your favourite singer who has a reputation of not using \u2018Autotune\u2019 can sometimes find himself in a position to use it. Not because he cannot hit the right notes, but to save time and energy. :) Hope this satisfies your query. :) ",
