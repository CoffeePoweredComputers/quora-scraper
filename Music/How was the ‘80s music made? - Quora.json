            "answer_text": "The real sound of the 80s came from great equipment and the rise of electronic synths and great songwriting\u2026  Bands like Naked Eyes, Tears for Fears, A-HA, Modern English, Dexys Midnight Runners were produced by incredible producers that often used slow melodic lyrics over an upbeat rhythm and single accent instrument like the synths (perhaps a Yamaha DX7) or processed Violin or over driven sustained Guitar. The Semi dance beat was often recorded with a muffled snare sound with maybe a strong bass support.  While there was mainstream pop, classic rock and disco still receiving heavy radio play - club music was ramping up on the new sound - almost from the line of 70s Punk to New Wave it was almost a hybrid of New Wave and a new sound from and amalgam of genres by fused by keen producers. 100s of songs that had THAT sound where loaded into clubs, juke boxes, and after hours clubs. This spread to a sound that was loved then and is still loved today. Often the songs were centered around a very personal emotion or universal feeling. The voice and purpose of the songs took front stage\u2026 the vocals where recorded with such care as to not lose the personal connection to the lead singer. The vocals often incorporated some area of the singers 3 registers and often made seguing between the registers the subtle star of the song. In plain words you could connect and relate to the vocal as if they were talking to you.  Top this of with new in-genius sounds and rolling or toe tapping rhythms with pioneers of MIDI keyboards - made up with the new and current instrument sounds made this one incredible era of music - even though this 80s subsect genre\u2026 took a back seat to mainstream it wasn\u2019t long until some of these mellowish upbeating club songs found their way up to the top of the charts. \u201cEverybody wants to Rule the World\u201d especially the new producers\u2026 Dimitri Czapkiewicz ",

I found a very informative video for you by a guy who clearly knows his stuff. Why does 80s pop music sound so good? Read the video description too! ",
