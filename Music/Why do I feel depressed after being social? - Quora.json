            "answer_text": "There can be so many reasons/factors behind this. The depression (that is, if you really ARE depressed, because in childhood and adolescence your mood is influenced by so many biological and social factors) could be interfering with your ability to enjoy being social and maybe every time you engage with people, you are reminded of how your life is not as happy as theirs or something (which is debatable). But my strongest hunch is that you have an introverted/asocial personality, and your bursts of hyper-social behaviour are almost like a sort of overcompensation for what you think is abnormal behavior. Introverts are are especially sensitive to their own internal environment and often have trouble with understanding and relating to other people. When placed in social situations, the introvert's main worry is how he/she comes across to the other people, and this worry can be so crippling that it stops them from enjoying social interactions. The more people involved in a social situation, the more worried an introvert becomes, and the process of scrutinizing and analyzing the effects and repercussions of every single action carried out during the social interaction can often leave introverts feeling drained or depressed afterwards. To make things worse, this over-analysis of internal cues often makes an introvert exaggerate the impact of anything they do, which means they can be ruminating over a conversation long after it ends, criticizing themselves for their words and reactions and comparing their unease with all the other people involved in the situation. This is especially worse during teenage years, where the constantly changing rules of childhood to adulthood complicates things. The combination of persistent worry and self doubt creates negative psychological association with socializations and with time, most introverts become increasingly solitary, as being by themselves helps to avoid the stress they feel when being around others. All this sounds gloomy and a bit depressing, but there's a silver lining to the script. Many introverts who manage to work through their fears of social interactions go on to become some of the best conversationalists, because they've spent years analyzing the importance and impact of words they use. It's not easy to get to the point of feeling less stressed by socialisation, but as with all things, practice makes perfect. The main way to overcome this fear is (obviously) to engage in more conversations. However, to avoid overloading yourself, you start small. One on one. That way, you only have to work on one person's responses. As you become accustomed to this, you find it's easier to handle small groups (it often just seems like a multiplication of a one on one conversation). But as the group increases, the diversity of ideas increase, and you can even choose to be an observer rather than direct the conversation. Nobody can force you to speak, and if you feel uncomfortable in such a situation, you can excuse yourself and return later if you choose. Baby steps. But all in all, you'll become less stressed/annoyed/depressed when facing social situations. I still consider myself an introvert, but I have friends who will tell you I'm not. It's almost funny. In my years of studying people and interacting in social situations, I found that most people in a conversation are more interested in what is being said than in the person speaking, and are usually too busy thinking of how to add to the discussion that they don't take as much time to scrutinize or analyze what anyone else says. People are usually not as hard on you as you are on yourself, and this realization helped alleviate some of the self-destructive criticisms I gave to myself when I was floundering in social situations. It also helped that I took out time to study and appreciate myself, own my flaws and remind myself that it's okay to mess up and get embarrassed and be silly. Nobody is perfect. Most times, we look at the highlights of other people's lives and compare it to the bloopers in ours. But honestly, if you really get to know other people, you'll realise you don't suck as much as you think. Just keep trying to improve yourself and you'll be fine. ",

            "answer_text": "Why do I feel depressed after being social? As others have speculated, you are probably an introvert. This is nothing bad, this is not something you need to fix. I had extrovert and introvert explained to me this way. You have an internal social battery, as it were. Extroverts get their batteries charged by being with a lot of people, they love the parties, Mardi Gras in New Orleans is wonderful for them, they will be out partying the entire time. They are going to be the ones throwing the biggest Super Bowl Party. But they hate being alone. They can\u2019t stand to spend more than a few hours, maybe a day without some social stimulation. It is totally draining for them. Introverts on the other hand get their batteries charged by curling up on a couch with a blanket and warm cup of cocoa watching it snow. A golden retriever would complete the picture. A good book will occupy them for hours. Small dinner parties, with maybe three or four couples is just what they like. They find large parties draining. After being at a large party, introverts usually feel drained and exhausted, it can feel very depressing. But if the feelings don\u2019t last longer than a day or so, it isn\u2019t a disorder you need to worry about. Which ever personality type you are, you just need to learn to manage your life accordingly. An extrovert can go to small dinner parties, they may be the life of the party, or get bored quickly, but they can do it. They are definitely not going to do it very often. The next day they are going to want to go do something, like go to a ball game or a casino. An introvert can go to the big parties, if they can find a corner to make a homebase, then make forays into the \u201cdeep end of the pool\u201d to say hello to people, then come back, they do just fine (that\u2019s what I do). Of course, they may not get out of bed the next day because they are so drained. Neither of these things is good or bad, they are just different personalities, and wouldn\u2019t it be boring if we were all the same? Understand what social events are best for you, and understand that sometimes you need to go outside of your comfort zone, and figure out how to deal with it. Plan for events out of your comfort zone so you know what to expect. If I am expected to go to a large event, I usually rehearse in my mind what is going to happen, who is going to be there, and how I am going to react to it. I have been able to make it through some rather large events. Of course, I am not going to want to be around more than three or four people at a time for the next week! I also plan for that. No appointments, nothing that would make me have to leave my apartment. As my husband and I both are both introverts, I have no idea how an extrovert deals with coming out of their comfort zone. I hope this helps. ",
