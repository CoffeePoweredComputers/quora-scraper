            "answer_text": "Probably not enough - I kind of see it like this: If you have a regular job as an accountant, say, or an engineer, or some sort of administrator, where you go to an office in the morning and return home in the evening, you put in a good solid 7 or 8 hours a day of working, and in a five-day work week you put in around 40 hours. As a professional musician, working in bars, I found that it was unusual to work five days a week; you'd probably get three to four, and you'd work from about 9 or 10 in the evening until two or three in the morning.  And that's not solid work - it's about half on half off.  Let's be charitable and say it's about 20 hours a week. Now to balance that with a regular job, you'd have to be putting in about 20 hours of practice a week.  If there's 2 days off, then that would be about four hours of practice a day. Some musicians rehearse with their bands on off days.  That might take up another 10 hours a week. So, basically, your average working rock band bar gigging guitar player should be practicing about two solid hours a day in addition to anything else, to be working as hard as an office worker.  Solo practice that is; woodshedding, learning technique, maybe going to lessons, learning tunes for his gig, whatever. BUT being a musician is not a job it's a calling!  We love it; despite the hardships, lack of money, lack of respect, lack of job security, we do it because there's nothing better than the feel of your instrument in your hands as you are coaxing this awesome music out of it. So it should be more! But most of the guitarists I ever knew relied on natural skill and once they'd reached professional level, hardly ever put any time into improving.  Many just liked to lie about all day smoking dope and hanging, and try to sober up in time for the gig.  Maybe. OK now that's ROCK guitarists; others may be different.  But I bet  nobody practices enough, perhaps with the exception of die-hard virtuoso classical guys. And they're just nuts anyway. Here's a rough guide:   ",

            "answer_text": "Highly variable, because skill/musical level of professional guitarists varies quite a bit, and what they\u2019re trying to accomplish varies quite a bit, but I\u2019ll share a few data points. I once met guitarist John Petrucci from Dream Theater. If you don\u2019t know who he is, he\u2019s a graduate of Berklee School of Music and probably one of the best rock guitarists on the planet. I asked him how much he practiced guitar growing up. Petrucci: a lot Me: Several hours a day? Him: Yes. Me: More than 8 hours/day? Him: Yes, on some days. Next data point is conversation with undergrad and graduate classical guitar university students. Getting right to the point, the undergrads are expected to spend not LESS than 3 hours/day practicing. . .some play more . . .a few a LOT more.. The grad students/PhD candidates, even more than that! This is basically the same with the other classical musicians, and the non-classical ones. If you\u2019re in music school you\u2019ll be spending a BIG chunk of your awake time practicing/playing. Balancing that out, I\u2019ve heard multiple professional classical musicians (including world famous violinst Izhak Perlman) say that more than 3 hours/day practice probably doesn\u2019t really help. Lastly, once you\u2019ve hit a certain level of proficiency, you can probably get away with less practice than someone who is still at a sub-professional level. ",
