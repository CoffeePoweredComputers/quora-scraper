            "answer_text": "In the home position (between the nut and the 4th fret), the hardest \u201cbasic\u201d chord is E major. Unfortunately, this is also one of the easiest to play on guitar, so you\u2019ll find a lot of guitar songs that use this chord. The traditional ways to play E major are:   So, you are either playing a barre chord and need to practice keeping an even pressure on your index finger across the top3 strings, or you are going to have to cram three fingers down on the top three strings without touching the first string. These both require good technique, holding your thumb under the neck rather than wrapping around it, and holding your wrist high. The \u201cukulele cowboy\u201d chord version is not much easier to play:  This one requires some gymnastics to hold your ring finger out of the way and apply an even pressure with your pinky while the middle finger is jammed under your wrist. There are also a few complex chords that require all four fingers with some twists and stretches to hit the required notes. Here are three of them:    There are plenty of ways to \u201ccheat\u201d and skip one string or drop one note to keep the desired emotion of the chord in the song without forcing your hand into weird and uncomfortable positions. Which string to omit or which note to alter will depend on the song and on how you choose to make the song yours. Or slow things down and learn how to make and hold those complex chord shapes without muting or buzzing. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for asking me, but I really don\u2019t know the answer from my own playing experience. I\u2019ve never played a ukulele except to remember that the tuning cries aloud, \u201cMy dog has fleas\u201d\u2014a C6 chord. Some change that to a D6 chord, which Uke Buddy (Ukulele Chords) says that it gives the ukulele a sweeter tone. Try the new tuning. If nothing else, it may keep the dog from getting heart worms. ;-) After I did a quick Google search, it seems that the answer for the hardest uke chord may be the E major chord. I could be wrong or have misunderstood another\u2019s reply online. I thought, \u201cE is so easy on a guitar!\u201d and \u201cHow can it be that hard on a uke?\u201d I reasoned that it\u2019s smaller and has \u201csofter\u201d strings. Well, to answer you, here is one site answering the question: How To Play The Horrific E Ukulele Chord \u2022 UkuGuides And, here is one of his alternate versions of the otherwise \u201chorrific\u201d E chord:  Visit that site and good luck with that and other chords.
