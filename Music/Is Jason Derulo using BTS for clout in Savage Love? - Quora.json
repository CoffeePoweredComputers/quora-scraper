            "answer_text": "I didn\u2019t even want to answer this. I didn\u2019t. Because it uses the word ClOuT. Again. What I want to say is simply this. Automatically agreeing that Jason Derulo used BTS for clout is insulting. But here is why. It implies that people don\u2019t trust members of BTS with their own career. That they are just walking around blind and practically begging to work with anyone. Being duped and used. Do you honestly think that they can\u2019t sniff out a clout chaser?? Do you think they just go around letting people \u201cuse them\u201d? Do you not trust them to make the best professional decisions in their own careers?? Can\u2019t people ever think that maybe other artists WANT to work with them? Because they think they\u2019re talented and they genuinely like them? Is everyone a clout chaser? I\u2019m not here to argue, just offer a different perspective. All I do know is, some fans are making it REALLY hard for BTS to work with any other artist. Because they know they\u2019ll be attacked if they say one wrong thing. Maybe Jason didn\u2019t thank them or whatever. Ok. But does that automatically mean he didn\u2019t enjoy working with them or think that they\u2019re amazing artists? Even if you don\u2019t trust Jason, don\u2019t you trust them?  ",

            "answer_text": "I wasn\u2019t gonna answer this just because y\u2019all get mad at us when we say someone is using BTS for clout. But I don\u2019t give a single fuck. Anyways yes I do. Mister Jason mentioned he only started respecting BTS when he heard about how powerful our fandom was because on voting we were beating mainstream artists like, Ariana grande, and some other big people it was and Ellen interview. Then he didn\u2019t credit them. Now this is a big one for us\u2026 even other kpop stans are heated about it. Now just because it\u2019s BTS doesn\u2019t make it right if he did it to one of your favs I know you wouldn\u2019t be happy so let\u2019s not do the double standards thing. He didn\u2019t even mention jawshy, the creator of the melody and I heard he also stole it and didn\u2019t give him credit he just put lyrics on it and sang it. and before you say something like he didn\u2019t need BTS that song was no where to be seen on the charts before he collabed with them and yeah it was remix but sir you and we both no they got you that no.1. The crazy thing about all of this is I bet he didn\u2019t even know their names. and no we aren\u2019t trying to make this seem like BTS are victims it\u2019s just this has happened before so we get sick of it. Anyways what are your thoughts on this? ",
