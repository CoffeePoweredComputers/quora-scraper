            "answer_text": "Hello. When I wanted to learn how to make music I looked around and researched a lot of different DAWs out there. I looked at endless videos on youtube on different DAWs. I came across one that has been the best for my needs. I use magix music maker 2014. This has everything that I need. I went ahead and downloaded some free vsts from the internet and use them to make different types of music. I\u2019m not into any specific genre of music, because my music is very different. I have 9 DAWS some of those DAWs are free on the internet as well. I also bought what they call loops from a lot of places. Everything I buy is very inexpensive, because I don\u2019t have a lot of money to spend. I bought a very cheap midi keyboard and this keyboard has pads that I can use for multiple uses like drums and very deep sounds that create an aura in the music I\u2019m creating. It all has to do with what you can get out of your equipment and what you\u2019re aiming for. Not all music will lead you to the same music you hear on the radio. I have seen others that use huge machines to make their music like analog synthesizers racks that take up a whole wall to make the type of music you hear in discos. You can create any type of music your way by experimenting with many things within the equipment. So the uses of any DAW whether it\u2019s inexpensive is limitless. You can manipulate sounds and slow them up or fasten them up. It\u2019s your choice. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Like questions about any musical gear you need to establish a budget. For your needs one of the most important considerations will be your software, as it will be used for production and instrumentation rather than simply being a medium to input microphones and external instruments. Watch tutorials about Ableton, see which version suits your needs while fitting your budget. You'll want one good microphone for vocals, I'd suggest saving up for a Shure SM7B, at only $350($275 used) it's a fully professional microphone that has been used with numerous A-list artists including Michael Jackson! Compare that to the cost of other industry standard mics like the Neumann U87 ($3600) and you can see that it's worth saving a few hundred bucks more for the SM7B over some other $100 condenser. You'll need an interface that will serve 3 main Purposes: providing quality output to your speakers, quality inputs and a preamplifier for your mic. I suggest the Steinberg UR22 Lastly you'll want a pair of Studio monitors that act as an accurate representation of what you have going on in your recordings. You'll have to excuse me if you already knew this, but it's important to understand that studio monitors aren't meant to sound \u201cgood\u201d but to sound accurate, so that you can hear what problems to address in the mix. A decent set for someone getting into this would be a pair of Yamaha HS8\u2019s Have fun! ",
