            "answer_text": "On YouTube, the treatment of copyright is specific. As of today, you can just upload the copyrighted material. Done! There are no penalties for uploading someone else\u2019s song to YouTube, whether an original copy of it, or a cover version. It\u2019s impossible to say how YouTube reacts to this for every user, but my experience has been that I would just receive an email, saying \u201cdon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Like this:  I\u2019ll assume all accounts are handled this way. It\u2019s possible there may be different treatments, but from my experience, this always happens the same way. This is the history: YouTube, as its name implies, is a VIDEO channel. It\u2019s a place to post videos. It was not foreseen that people would post MUSIC that had NO VIDEO (usually video that\u2019s just filler, like a static image). At first, YouTube would simply say \u201cno\u201d if you tried to upload someone else\u2019s content. But people kept doing it, both copyrighted video and audio. Artists and producers complained, because they owned the content. Free Beer YouTube realized the influx of otherwise-owned stuff was huge. People kept uploading things with no regard for if it was owned, or if it was non-video. The public didn\u2019t care. The public didn\u2019t go to a music website, like Spotify or Soundcloud. They wanted something visual with their experience. They felt comfortable on YouTube; could find everything there, and people kept uploading more stuff. YouTube, whether it wanted to or not, became the primary depository for anything and everything, and the default location to look for anything and everything! Eventually, YouTube got together with the complainers, the artists who owned the material (both audio and video), and explained the situation. They could either blow up YouTube, or accept the reality. YouTube was no longer a video channel, but now it was also a music destination, and everybody used it to find music for free. It was also, potentially, a destination for all sorts of copyrighted material, YouTube explained to these unhappy song and video content creators. From the artist\u2019s point of view, everybody was getting their stuff for free. From YouTube\u2019s point of view, they were rejecting too many uploads; so many, it forced them to rethink the entire purpose of YouTube. The results are, YouTube is no longer a video site, but it\u2019s also a music site (and TV, now, too). It\u2019s no longer trying to stop everyone from getting music, or from getting things for free. They gave in. They made deals with the artists and IPR owners. Paperwork went back and forth, and everyone was happy. The artists only wanted exposure, and money, so YouTube started to pay them. Happy artists! The design of YouTube would have to change a bit, but with the advantage of extreme growth. Spotify didn\u2019t stand a chance. YouTube\u2019s plan: to lay its own ads on what you uploaded, thank you for uploading it, and pay the artist. You are not allowed to monetize anything that gets copyright flagged. Simple! You will be flagged by robots, even if only one line of a James Taylor song plays in the background of your video for 20 seconds, if the bots catch it. Free Music on YouTube! YouTube is now the primary source of music for young people. That\u2019s where they go, and they get what they want, as they expect, for free. YouTube also no longer cares if there\u2019s any substance whatsoever to your video content. While it used to be a video site, now, not so much. There\u2019s still lots of video, but if you want to post that still image for the entire five-minute song, go ahead, they don\u2019t care. One more step in the growth direction \u2026 one reason they don\u2019t care is, James Taylor is happy, and now, YouTube has his entire collection of songs in its database, and didn\u2019t pay anyone a penny to get it all uploaded in high definition. Even the older songs that never had videos. That\u2019s why they let you. So they can build their audio channel, which competes directly with all the majors, Spotify, Apple Music, all of them, and it\u2019s free. Voila. Lemons to lemonade. YouTube has now officially launched both YouTube Music (note the abandonment of being a video site), and YouTube TV. We handed it to them on a silver platter. Their database is already full! To answer your question, the only penalty for posting content that is owned by someone else, is you can\u2019t monetize it yourself. This is not a big hit on anyone, as no-one expects to make money on stolen material, and even if you\u2019re a partner (who hasn\u2019t been disabled), we\u2019re talking pennies. Gotta love Google! No-one could seem to figure out the formula for monetizing music, in this new world, Google let the public tell them, then changed their Internet presence to adapt. You want free? Okay, it\u2019s free! Since I went through this entire history, I\u2019ll round it off - there is one catch. At the point where YouTube solved the music IPR problem, they were making money on ads shown on videos, and still planned to do that. But artists quickly realized, if someone\u2019s cooking eggs in the kitchen, with the computer running YouTube (not Spotify) playlists from the living room, they\u2019re not watching the video ads! Expect to see more interruption of your music while this is worked out. It would be a ground-up renovation for YouTube to switch to audio ads. What will they do? They\u2019ll stop the music from playing if your eyeballs aren\u2019t on the screen (if you don\u2019t pay the monthly fee for YouTube Music). How will they do that? By not allowing music to play in the background on your smartphone. It\u2019s already starting to happen! The iPod is officially dead! Hope that helps! See you on YouTube! Original question: Is there a way to upload a video containing copyrighted songs to YouTube? ",

            "answer_text": "You would have to get permission and the right to do so from the owner of the song or other piece of music. This would most likely cost money. However you may be able to play a small clip of copyrighted music or fairly long sections of copyrighted video as long as it falls under the fair use guidelines on youtube. Below is some information copied from the Youtube page on fair use. Different countries have different rules about when it\u2019s acceptable to use material without the copyright owner\u2019s permission. For example, in the United States, works of commentary, criticism, research, teaching or news reporting might be considered fair use. Some other countries have a similar idea called fair dealing that may work differently. Courts analyse potential fair uses according to the facts of each specific case. You\u2019ll probably want to get legal advice from an expert before uploading videos that contain copyright-protected material. The four factors of fair use: In the United States, fair use is determined by a judge, who analyses how each of the four factors of fair use applies to a specific case. 1. The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes Courts typically focus on whether the use is \u201ctransformative\u201d. That is, whether it adds new expression or meaning to the original, or whether it merely copies from the original. Commercial uses are less likely to be considered fair, though it is possible to monetise a video and still take advantage of the fair use defence. 2. The nature of the copyrighted work Using material from primarily factual works is more likely to be fair than using purely fictional works. 3. The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole Borrowing small bits of material from an original work is more likely to be considered fair use than borrowing large portions. However, even a small taking may weigh against fair use in some situations if it constitutes the \u201cheart\u201d of the work. 4. The effect of the use upon the potential market for, or value of, the copyrighted work Uses that harm the copyright owner\u2019s ability to profit from his or her original work are less likely to be fair uses. Courts have sometimes made an exception under this factor in cases involving parodies. ",

            "answer_text": "You ask the copyright owner for permission to use the music, and you make sure you can proof that he has given you permission. Just to be clear: it rarely happens that you get this permission, especially if it's popular music. Otherwise, you're always taking a risk. YouTube actually has some deals with some record labels, so they'll tolerate the use of their music in exchange for a share of the advertising revenue. But it's not like there's a big list of songs you can use. So if you use copyrighted music without permission, there's always a risk that your video gets taken down and you get a strike on your channel. Or the video won't play in certain countries where YouTube doesn't have a deal with copyright owners. The safest way to use music in your videos is to use Creative Commons music. YouTube itself has a nice Audio Library with music that you can use without restriction: https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music. And then there are also websites such as Royalty-Free Music and Jamendo - Royalty free music downloads - Licensing. If you take the effort to look around a bit, you can find several good substitutes for copyrighted music. ",

Most uploads just get a warning that you can\u2019t monetize. So far, I\u2019ve only had 1 video completely blocked that I had to delete. This is why a majority of my content uses non-copyright music, and I only use copyrighted music when necessary. ",

If you intend to use a work of art, such as video, music, text, or song, in another work, you need to either acquire a license to do so, or you need to follow the rules of fair use exception. For instance, it is perfectly OK to quote art works for the purposes of CRITICISM, SATIRE, or NEWS REPORTING. You could easily make a YouTube channel \u201cNews from the music industry\u201d, where you would play 30 second fragments of newly released songs - provided you would approach it as actual journalism and properly cite who is the author, the interpreter etc. You can also quote art works if you are a \u2018reviewer\u2019 of arts. You must be careful not to engage in defamation/libel/slander (each of those words means something slightly different), but it\u2019s fair use to review works of art.  One important thing to add: Be careful not to ever use works of art that have not yet been officially released. For instance, some copies of one of the Harry Potter books were stolen during transportation before selling commenced, and anyone who would publish or quote them before the official publication date would have committed a crime.
