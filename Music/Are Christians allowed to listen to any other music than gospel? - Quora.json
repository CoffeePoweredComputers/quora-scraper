            "answer_text": "Of course, Christians are allowed to listen to other music. Who did you think can forbid a Christian from listening to certain music? God has not given such authority to anyone (apart from the authority that parents have over their children). The Bible is silent on musical styles. The Bible speaks against obscene and violent lyrics. However, the decision of what music to listen to is between the Christian and God. If God and the person's conscience don't forbid a person from listening then the person is free to listen. ",
