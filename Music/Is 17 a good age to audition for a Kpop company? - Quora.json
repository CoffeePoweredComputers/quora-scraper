            "answer_text": "companies usually look for young people to become trainees, esp if their skills are lacking. it doesn't really matter what age you audition, as long as you're not too old. preferrably younger than 24. if you know your skills are lacking, then you might wanna start a bit earlier. if that's not an option, then you'd have to train for a long time, and you'd probably only debut once you're 20. in some cases, you have all the skills that company is looking for, but they don't have the right trainees to debut with you. it could take years to find members for a new group, and sometimes members might leave during the process. without these factors in mind, yes, 17 is a good age to audition. you'd be mature enough to make decisions and live on your own (if you're from abroad or if the company is far away from your home) but you're still very fresh and energetic.

            "answer_text": "I guess it depends. TBH it\u2019s easier to train a trainee kids, that\u2019s why some large company have their trainee mostly around age 11\u201315 and don\u2019t be surprised when they debuted really young but already very talented. It\u2019s risky though talentwise because\u2026 well, they will grow and their voice will break? Not only boys though, I also see girls grow up and have their voice change. But I guess it\u2019s truly easier to shape kid rather than teenager (15\u201317) because of\u2026 puberty. But 17 isnt bad tho, you probably just need to do extra work since, yeah, mostly people ripe at 17 years old. In male case, you could probably have shorter activity time (sorry for my english) because you need to enlist to military at some time, but, I\u2019ve seen people auditioned at 20 so why not? ",
