            "answer_text": "I used to listen to Judas Priest and Black Sabbath backwards all the time. I have met Ozzy Osbourne and all the members of Slayer and Cradle of Filth. I'm 47 years old and since I was 13 I have refused to listen to anything except classical and the darkest most brutal and evil metal I could find. The only reason I listened to Mayhem is because of the 1991 suicide of vocalist Per Yngve Ohlin (\"Dead\") and the 1993 murder of guitarist \u00d8ystein Aarseth (\"Euronymous\") by former member Varg Vikernes (\"Count Grishnackh\"), of Burzum. The only reason I listened to Burzum is because Varg Vikernes is a murderer who burned down ancient churches. The Satanic meaning and diabolic message of the music was all that mattered to me. Many metal musicians I have met have said to me or to someone else in my presence, (paraphrased) I don't get to play what I want, I have to deliver the Satanic message the music industry wants me to\u201d. Slayer guitarist Kerry King addressed Tom Araya's Catholic beliefs in an interview; Kerry tells P6 Beat: \"It's really funny, because Tom, historically, really wouldn't talk to me about that. \"It would usually be a conversation between him and Jeff [Hanneman]. [Laughs] I don't know why. \"But, yeah - I always thought I would get to a point and just say something so offensive that that situation might happen, and it hasn't yet. \"I think he realizes Slayer is entertainment, and I think that's how Tom rationalizes his participation. \"I think that's how he gets by - in his interviews, he says his beliefs are his beliefs. \"But Slayer, since the early days, came about being a band that sings about taboo type of things, horror-movie references, anti-religious references\u2026 \"That's what Slayer is, and to do anything different now would just make every fan we've ever had hate us. [Laughs] And I like it. I like horror movies, and I like just darker topics.\" End of interview. Not only have I been listening to metal and Black metal all my life I have also been a practicing Satanist for most of that time until recently. The music and the worship of Satan were not mutually exclusive, one encouraged the other. Asking if, as a Christian, I can or should listen to black metal to me is similar to asking if I should stop summoning demons. Right now in my bedroom is a box full of very expensive very advanced and rare books explaining explicitly how to summon demons, curse people, and how to be a Satanic sorcerer. I have about $50,000 invested in the content of that box and it's going into an incinerator as soon as possible. (How much money is your soul worth?) If I gave it away or threw it away or sold it I would probably go to Hell. A demon followed and terrorized me for 6 years. Most of my Satanic grotos (coven) was murdered. Most of what happened concerning this; nobody would ever believe and some of it is so horrible; if I tell anyone it will instantly start happening to them too. Why am I telling you about this? The music you asked about led me into this situation. Everything concerned with or connected to the \u201cHollywood\u201d movie industry or the music industry is run by hardcore devil worshipers child molesters and far worse that nobody will ever believe. Many of the musicians are decent good people who are required by their job to deliver the Satanic message mandated by the music industry. For example Paul Stanley from KISS is a wonderful human being who believes in God, is very patriotic to America, and is a very ethical and moral person. However the people you never see, the executives and CEO\u2019s of the music industry are pedophiles, devil worshipers, and simply some of the worst most sick and depraved monsters you could ever meet -and they decide the message of the music. I don't believe listening to Dio, Black Sabbath, or Led Zeppelin is a sin or will offend God. Not because they are older bands but because of the much less demonic message and content. Hand of Doom is a warning against drugs, Electric Funeral is a warning of nuclear war, Stairway to Heaven is a warning against greed and avarice. All that being said newer black metal bands like Behexen, Marduk, Dimmu Borgir, and others are far more abrasive and purely Satanic as possible, thus their message is also purely Satanic. Bands like this make you angry even though you don't notice it, other people notice it in you. Bands like Rotting Christ and Black Funeral are as Satanic as possible and so is their message. these Satanic evil themes have a profound effect on the way you think, the relationships you have, and the decisions you make without you even being aware of it. In black magic there is a principal called the command to look based on subliminal and hypnotic suggestions in the form of a visual image. Black metal uses this principle of black magic and applies it as an auditory message. When you listen to black metal you are a willing victim of Satanic black magic. All of this is to be avoided by those seeking a godly life. Referring to the Children of the Devil John 8:42 Jesus therefore said to them: If God were your Father, you would indeed love me. For from God I proceeded, and came; for I came not of myself, but he sent me: 43 Why do you not know my speech? Because you cannot hear my word. 44 You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and he stood not in the truth; because truth is not in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof. You're a smart man. You can figure this out. Each individual band and each individual song has its own message. If that message is Satanic, dark, brutal, inhumane, and promotes evil, sin, chaos, and anarchy ITS BAD FOR YOU AND YOU NEED TO HAVE THE SELF CONTROL TO WALK AWAY FROM IT. Look man, I love cocaine, I mean I really love cocaine, but I have enough common sense to know it will kill you, and enough self control to walk away from it and never touch it again. You don't have to give up all the music you like but YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ARE LISTENING TO A MESSAGE FROM SATAN, AND YOU KNOW IT'S WRONG. If I can walk away from the many polygamous girlfriends, the drugs, the music scene, the money, the popularity power and influence I had as a Satanic magician, and everything that came with it and live my life for Christ -anybody can. The true army of the purest form of Satan is already waging war and murdering Christians by the hundreds daily in this world at this moment. Their primary goal is to exterminate Israel and America and force as many people to take the mark of Satan (Arabic: \u0628\u0633\u0645\u0644\u0629\u200e\u200e basmala) in their hand or forehead as they can. They are committed to claiming all of us in the name of their god Satan. Revelation 13:16 And he shall make all, both little and great, rich and poor, freemen and bondmen, to have a character in their right hand, or on their foreheads. 17 And that no man might buy or sell, but he that hath the character, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. 18 Here is wisdom. He that hath understanding, let him count the number of the beast. For it is the number of a man: and the number of him is six hundred sixty-six. I have worked in the middle east as a military intelligence field agent for over 10 years and I'm telling you, the beast/antichrist is here in our world now. Get your soul right with God and keep it that way brother. Proverbs 24:1 Seek not to be like evil men, neither desire to be with them: 2 Because their mind studieth robberies, and their lips speak deceits. Philippians 4:8 For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever modest, whatsoever just, whatsoever holy, whatsoever lovely, whatsoever of good fame, if there be any virtue, if any praise of discipline, think on these things. Pray to God everyday brother. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a Muslim from South Asia, although I\u2019m not a practicing one. From my late teen I\u2019ve been into metal music and I\u2019m a die hard fan of Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Sodom since then. From last 7\u20138 years I\u2019m into black metal music as well and I\u2019ve been maintaining a network of black metal musicians and fans around the globe (even I had some sort of contact with Varg Vikernes via email) I have some personal observations regarding the black metal musicians and the fans. The amount of negativity, the depth of grudge in their minds are just immense (in some extent this statement is true for myself as well). When I was only into the bands like maiden or priest, I honestly felt very positive inside my mind with their music. But from when I started to listening to black metal I could clearly feel that a hidden demon was just silently growing up inside my mind by the span of time, I started to think only about the negative and darkest possible sides of every aspects of human life. Most of the true black metal musicians and fans are complete failures at their lives. Yes, black metal impacts your career and social interactions in every possible way, as long as your mind day by day turns into a sanctuary of darkness and hate. About 5\u20136 years back I was emerging as one of the important young photojournalists from this part of the world, and but right now I\u2019m just doing shit with my career, I failed in one of my business ventures as well. And my addiction to black metal is kind of responsible for such demise of my career at this point. The core idea of Satan and the Antichrist in the Semitic/Abrahamic religions (Christianity, Islam and Judaism) are almost same. If you\u2019re a practicing christian and listening to black metal at the same time then I can clearly say that you\u2019re doing just wrong thing regarding to your belief. Black metal deals with satanic messages and satanic imagery, and of course this is not the only negative thing about black metal. The music that black metal musicians play has some sort of strong negative energy. Most of the black metal riffs are written in minor scales and deals with devil\u2019s interval. Thus black metal creates some sort of loopholes in your astral body and these loopholes then work as the gateways of satan to devour your body and the soul. If you\u2019re spiritual (no matter what religion you do follow) just give up listening to black metal. I didn\u2019t yet gave up listening to black metal but I can clearly feel that I should give up immediately at this point of my life. UPDATE: I gave up listening to black metal, and I\u2019m feeling much better in life most recently! ",
