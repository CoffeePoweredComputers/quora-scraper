            "answer_text": "I would say op 10 no. 6 is by far the easiest. It's pretty slow and the main difficulty is playing three notes chord on the right hand using 2\u20134\u20135 fingering instead of the usual 1\u20133\u20135 Op 10 no 9 is probably the second easiest to play. The main difficulty is playing largish intervals in the left hand. These two are probably accessible for a good intermediate player. The next easiest is op 25 no. 7 The difficulties are 1. creating three layers of voices with only two hands so you must be able to voice individual notes in a chord with your right hand. 2. Playing very fast passages in the left hand. op 25 no. 1 is also in this tier. The main difficulty is playing arpeggios spanning about one and a half octaves quickly in both hands at the same time. This is not as hard as it sounds if you learn the right wrist and arm techniques. op 10 no. 12 is also in this tier. op 10 no. 3 could be here too although the middle section of sixths is quite difficult to get note perfect. op 25 no. 12 could perhaps be squeezed in here as well if played under tempo. The difficulty is playing repeat notes using 1\u20135 and 5\u20131 fingering as you run up and down the octaves. In my opinion the rest of the etudes require more advanced techniques, abilities and tons of work. ",

            "answer_text": "EASIEST Op. 10, No. 9 [This one is all just left hand extensions. Tons of left hand stuff.]Op. 10, No. 12 [Again, this is an etude for the LH.]Op. 25 No. 7 [This etude focuses not on virtuosity, but rather on producing a gorgeous sound, like 10/3. This one would be perfect if you're looking for something slow and beautiful.]Op. 25 No. 2 [If, as indicated earlier, you're a right hand specialist, then this one would definitely be easiest, as it focuses almost entirely on the RH. However, for most people, I would assert with some reservation that this is the hardest] HARDEST ----- LEAST FUN Op. 25 No. 2 [Though this one is fast, and virtuosic, it has never really seized me. I love every single one of Chopin's 24 etudes, but out of this bunch, this one grabs me the least.]Op. 25 No. 7 [Heart-wrenching, gorgeous gorgeous etude. The fact that this does not make the top just goes to show how wonderful Chopin is. This one is a true delight to play -- not a delight in virtuosity, but a delight in profundity.]Op. 10 No. 9 [An absolute delight to play. One of my favorite things about this etude is the delightful amount of rubato one can employ, and the liberty the pianist has when performing the etude.]Op. 10 No. 12 [Absolutely incredible and exhilarating to play.] MOST FUN (Originally posted Feb 19, on Chopin Etude | Piano Forum) ",
