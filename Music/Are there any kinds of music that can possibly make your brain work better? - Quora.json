            "answer_text": "For me personally: the music I play myself. Becoming an active musician was one of the most important decisions in my life, and one I have never regretted for a second. Up to that point, most of my hobbies were Go (highly strategic Oriental board game), other board games, and mathematical puzzles. All of them were very similar to my job: a research scientist. Getting better at Go meant I was not getting better at my job, since both vied for the same mental capacity. Worse: when I was burned out because of work, my Go would suffer, leaving me more frustrated and depressed. Music, however, uses different parts of my brain. I can engage with music from a mathematical and theoretical point, try to rigorously practice tunes, or improvise and compose music, depending on my emotions, mental energy and schedule. It is versatile. Add to this that playing music with other people lets you meet people from various backgrounds, and engaging together in what feels like a universal language. It is thrilling and has helped me get into a better place, mentally. All of these things together have done my brain a world of good. As to what types of music I play: mostly Celtic and Blues, but I like to experiment with any type of music. The variation keeps it interesting. If you do not feel like playing music yourself but only to listening, that will probably be the case for you too: variation is the key. Find similarities between seemingly unrelated genres of music. Investigate the music from different angles. Imagine what a metal song would sound like if it were composed by Beethoven, or by Mozart, and how differently they would approach it. Imagine jazz using only very standard chords and scales, and imagine how much less interesting it would sound. Imagine what a simply child\u2019s song would sound like in a minor key. Listen attentively, if you have the energy. If not, find some music which does not draw your attention but is soothing. Your brain will pick up more than you think. ",

            "answer_text": "Songs of Mozart. How Mozart K448 can increase your IQ - Listen & Try The University of California at Irvine conducted a study to improve your IQ with specific kinds of music. The study psychologists observed that participants who listened to 10 minutes of a Mozart piano sonata achieved higher scores on a test of spatial intelligence than the participants who took the test without having listened to the music. The psychologists found, however, that when the participants listened to a different kind of music, i.e., a highly rhythmic dance piece or a hypnotic piece, no improvement in mental skills was observed. This phenomenon appears to suggest that the complex musical composition typical in Mozart\u2019s sonatas stimulate neural pathways that have a direct connection with mental skills. There is a growing body of science that asserts that music has a direct effect on human intelligence and can improve your IQ. In an issue of Neurological Research, Rauscher and Shaw reported that preschoolers who studied piano performed 34% better in spatial and temporal reasoning ability than preschoolers who spent the same amount of time learning to use computers. In the UC Irvine experiment, it was determined that people who listened to Mozart\u2019s Sonata for Two Pianos (K. 488) for 10 minutes before taking a test in abstract and spatial reasoning did significantly better than those who listened to 10 minutes of relaxation instruction or who, for 10 minutes, sat in silence. Compilations of Mozart pieces have been recorded on compact discs for the precise purpose of increasing IQ and achieving the kind of measurable IQ improvement documented in the famed University of California at Irvine study.

            "answer_text": "Technically, all music is good for your mind. No matter how simple or complex the music is, it engages your mind extensively. Now, I am not a scientist but rather a musician myself, so I can't go into details regarding specific neurological responses.  However, I can say that a typical answer to this question would suggest listening to composers such as Mozart for the purpose of cognitive enhancement (see Mozart Effect), but I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that many pop and even hip-hop tunes engage the brain to at least a similar degree.  I would suggest exposing yourself to post-tonal music. Fair warning: it may take many listens for you to grow accustomed to this type of music let alone develop any sort of liking for it. Composers of this genre include Schoenberg (in his later works), Webern (also in his later works), Boulez, Grisey (my personal favorite), and Penderecki. I would advise you to listen to all of Grisey's \"Les espaces acoustiques\" first, but don't give up if you find it creepy or unsettling at first. With enough exposure, this music can open your mind to a world of color.  ",

            "answer_text": "There is a correlation (not causation) between IQ and music preference. People with low IQ tend to prefer rhythm on their musical preferences. People with average IQ tend to prefer harmony on their musical preferences. People with high IQ tend to prefer melody on their musical preferences. Highly intelligent people prefer classical music with strong melodic overtones, such as Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Sibelius, Chopin, Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky etc. They also prefer progressive rock, especially prog metal, and jazz. Note that musical taste is highly personal, but strongly rhythmic styles with trivial melodies, such as rap, hip-hop, rockabilly, reggae, ska or punk are not likely to appeal to people with high IQ.

Binaural beats. This is the more scientific apporach. Our brains have a particalr frequency for each kind of emotion. Quantum Focus - Super Mental Focus - Study / Work Focus Improvement - Binaural Beats Binaural beats use this to cause a cognitive dissonance. Two seperate beats are played together with a constant \u201cgap\u201d between them. This causes our brains to \u201cfill in the blanks\u201d by producing certain vibrations. This basically means that you can cheat your brain into becoming focused, happy, or as you desire. The effects are very slight, it is like a stepping stone to better focus. Gradually our brains get better at this and it becomes a habit. Convenient isn't it ? :) ",

For some it's hardcore or rock, for others it's classical or jazz. I would suggest listening to many different types and for periods of time really understand the artist/music/genre. Take time to connect to how it makes you feel. Because the best music for my brain will not be what's best for yours. The music that helps my brain depends on the mood I'm in. If I want to write a proposal and need clarity, I go with instrumental music. Classical, jazz, reggae dub, dubstep, something without words or lyrics to process. If I'm in the mood for a intense physical workout, I like to listen to higher energy type music. Something with aggressive tone. Rap, Hardcore, Punk, Rock etc. Sometimes I feel like grieving over my parents divorce or the loss of family members and I listen to something slower, maybe morbid, folkish even. My answer is ALL OF IT! LOL ",

Help it to concentrate, or to focus, or to rehabilitate or to improve it\u2019s capacity and capability?? But one thing that I\u2019ve always heard and I have tried it myself and found success, is that if you\u2019re trying to study or concentrate on something it is best to listen to music that is not really catchy or repetitive as far as lyrics, melody or beat. This kind of music gives your brain something to latch on to and engage it, thus reverting your brain\u2019s attention away from the task at hand. So that music you love to sing along to in your car or dance to at a party or club is NOT ideal when you need to focus. As some folks have mentioned, classical is a good route or I like smooth jazz. The great thing about a lot of jazz is that it\u2019s heavy on the improv and unpredictability. Therefore, your brain can\u2019t latch on to a predictable rhythm, beat or melody. Im not a big fan of the really quirky jazz or jazz that has sudden blasts of sound, though, as they can be distracting. When I\u2019m sitting at my computer writing, filing my taxes or studying for a test, I enjoy the Vince Guaraldi Trio! ",
