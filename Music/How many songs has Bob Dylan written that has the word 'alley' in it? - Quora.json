Two or three come to mind immediately but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a bunch more. The three that I can think of are: Subterranean Homesick BluesBob Dylan\u2019s 115th DreamStuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues AgainEdit- I thought of one more- \u201cTombstone Blues\u201d. That should\u2019ve been the first one I thought of since it\u2019s in the chorus. lol",
