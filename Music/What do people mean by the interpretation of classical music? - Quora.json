            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A I think the easiest analogy is with language. An example: \"To be or not to be, that is the question.\"  (the opening words of Hamlet's famous soliloquy)  One actor says: \"To be.... or not to be?\" as though asking a question. Another one practically whispers, \"to be or not to be,\" as though he's ruminating to himself, not actually saying the words out loud. Another one declaims: \"To BE, or NOT to BE!\" as though he's a courtroom lawyer trying to sway the opinion of a jury. And yet another actor puts the emphasis on the second part of the statement: \"to be or not to be, THAT is the question.\"  Each of those is an interpretation of the same group of words, depending on how those words strike the actor (or the director), and what effect the actor (or director) is going for.  The same is true for musical interpretation. The same notes can be played in many ways---fast, slow, dreamy, unevenly rushed, stoically, emotionally, frantically, in a monotone---the possibilities are many. There's no such thing as \"the right way\" to perform anything. We can only guess what the composer's intent was, based on what they wrote and any notes they may have jotted down about what they tried to achieve. After that, it's all guesswork, intuition, and experience.  I happen to believe that Alfred Brendel has great insight into the piano music of Schubert because he spent his entire career performing those works, learning them inside out, and studying everything he could about the composer and his music. Does that mean a 20 year old pianist doesn't have an equally valid interpretation? Not at all, though I might not agree with his/her point of view, anymore than I might agree that Hamlet's words should be spoken, \"to be or not to be? that is the QUESTION?\" ",

            "answer_text": "Interpretation is normally used to describe the process the performer/ensemble goes through in choosing tempo, dynamics, phrasing, articulation, tone etc. for the performance. It is a really visible process in ensemble music. In a quartet, for example, you will spend a lot of rehearsal time agreeing how phrasing and articulation will work at the micro level, and how the overall shape of the piece will be structured at the macro level. Of course a solo performer has exactly the same decisions to make, and will make them just as consciously (if they are good).   There are interpretative decisions to make on the day, in the performance, but they need to be grounded in a thoughtful preparation. Here are two radically different interpretations of the same piece:       Different composers give different amounts of latitude to the performer in the written direction.  Some will mark every tempo, every articulation, every dynamic.  Others will leave a lot more to the judgement of the performer. ",
