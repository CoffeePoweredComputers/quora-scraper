            "answer_text": "Thanx for the A2A. I am going to assume you are talking about \u201cnew\u201d guitars. The Ibanez RG470 was originally released in the \u201898 and ran through \u201804 I believe and was slightly different in the later years of release. There are a couple different versions. I will use the lowest cost one for this comparison. These two guitars have a definite price difference when compared. The LTD is ESP\u2019s lower cost line. They are usually know to be quality instruments though. The MH-10 is definitely a beginners guitar, and is advertise as one. It\u2019s a string through Basswod body hard tail, has an \u201cengineered hardwood\u201d fretboard with 24 frets, 2 humbuckers and only comes in solid colors. The Ibanez is twice the price and it shows in the features and I\u2019m sure in playability. I own 2 Ibanez RG\u2019s and they are outstanding guitars. Both in affordability and playability. I would buy another in a heartbeat. The RG470MB has a Mahogany body, Ibanez\u2019s Wizard 3pc maple neck & fretboard (some versions have a Rosewood fingerboard), 24 jumbo frets, 2 humbuckers and 1 single coil pickup. It also has a Floyd Rose Dbl locking tremolo system and comes in a few different finishes, solid, transparent, sparkle and more. I own an Ibanez RG450MB and I love it. It is a joy to play, the neck is fast and I can crank on the tremolo bar like I an Joe Satriani or Eddie VanHalen for hours and it stays in tune (key is setting it up RIGHT). I can highly recommend the Ibanez RG series, but only if it\u2019s has a Floyd Rose Tremolo on it, it\u2019s the double locking variety. If the guitar doesn\u2019t have a locking nut and the tremolo doesn\u2019t have fine tuners, forget it. You would be better off with a hardtail. So if the choice is between the two you listed and your budget allows it, buy the Ibanez RG. You will not be disappointed. The LTD is listed on the ESP webpage as a \u201cbeginners\u201d guitar. And while I am sure it plays well, The Ibanez is leaps and bounds better than that particular model. ESP guitars are outstanding, but are more expensive as well. LTD is their lower level offering. There are much better models of LTD out there. And I\u2019m sure a few would be the same quality or better than the Ibanez RG470, the MH-10 isn\u2019t one of them. ",
