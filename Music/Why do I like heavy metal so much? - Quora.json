            "answer_text": "Why do I/WE like heavy metal so much?Or let's agree on metal in general. Because this form of music in all its variety can transport messages and stories in a very specific way.Metal tends to be energetic and very outspeaking. It is a very extroverted genre, if you ask me. That genre is really good for telling stories. See for Cradle of Filth for an example.I've chosen this band because I know how they are very misunderstood by fans and nonfans alike.Cradle of Filth for an example is telling us gothic and fantastic stories, stories with a core of truth expanded into the realm of exxageration.What genre could be better than metal to transport the stories and the meaning of those straight into your head if not with metal and its blasting energy?You can incorporate so many thing into metal to make the stories even more gloomy and intrigue. Or see for Deathstars, also a sometimes misunderstood group.The singer, at least through their earlier albums, always wrote about the inner darkness and confusion and feelings when he went through a particular part of his life. And metal combined with elements of electronic genres brings these memories to life like no other genre and makes it go straight into the head of the listeners. Or Ayreon, a very interesting project by Arjen Anthony Lucassen.Telling you about adventures of characters you never met before, also having them conversating to each other (depends on what album and story you listen to).Again metal brings out the adventurous side of the stories like no other genre can do. Can you imagine a story about wild knights and dragons being told in a rap song?Or the story about the Blood Countess Bathory brought to you in a Trance tune?I could not. Honestly I can not imagine that. Metal is our modern day opera and stage music. Just in case some people wonder why some metal groups dress up in certain ways. So now you know why I like it so much.I don't know why you like it so much as the question begs to be answered. ",

            "answer_text": "Because it resonates with me in a really , really deep way . I feel most of the time and that I can really relate to the lyrics and I feel a lot of it is very intelligently written and performed . There are many different styles of Metal and it also has many different ranges in both music and vocals . I don't think any of it sounds the same , yes some of it does sound similar to other pieces by other bands but it is extremely rare that Metal rips off other metal note for note , word for word . I don't find it to be screaming and shouting for the sake of it some of the vocalists have a lot of melody in their voices such as Howard Jones from Killswitch Engage , Corey Taylor - Slipknot & Stone Sour and Ivan  - Five Finger Death punch to name just a few. I feel that it greatly empowers me to do and think what I want and fight for what I believe is right when Authority figures are giving me shit about something . ",
