            "answer_text": "I think the owner of the question confuses Napoleon\u2019s victory against semi independent local Egyptian Mamelukes with Ottoman army. Battle of Pyramides was an easy victory for Napoleon although Mamelukes fought bravely. Their battle tactics and military was not up to date. On the other hand, Ottoman forces kept him at bay at Siege of Acre and it was the turning point of Napoleon's invasion of Egypt and Syria, along with the Battle of the Nile. However Napoleon not just talked highly of the Turks\u2026 He talked highly of Egyptians as well\u2026 He told them his army and soldiers were considering to become Muslims, Islam was a wonderful religion, Egyptians were great soldiers etc. It was simply politics. Insulting an enemy just motivates them better. However saying nice words have always a softening impact. Even in our personal lives, an insult makes us more resistant but nice words take people\u2019s guard lower.  Caricature of Napoleon I.

George Orwell, 1984 It might be wise to keep in mind although Turks were former shadow of themselves , they had the potential to change the game for Napoleon. It is like imagining George Foreman and Muhammad Ali at the same ring. And there is a third boxer who is out of shape and old. However once third boxer involves into the fight on the side of Foreman, even Muhammad Ali might lose the match. Therefore Ali tells nice things to the third boxer for a change. To keep him neutral as much as possible\u2026  Source of the picture: Napoleonic Propaganda At The British Museum Napoleon killed captive Ottoman soldiers mercilessly and against the unwritten war rules of the time. However Ottoman were allies with French for centuries and he merely destroyed that great legacy by invading Egypt. He needed the good words to fix things between old allies. On the other hand, he was good at controlling his own soldiers. By Sun Tzu\u2019s words: \u2018\u2019Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look upon them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death. If, however, you are indulgent, but unable to make your authority felt; kind-hearted, but unable to enforce your commands; and incapable, moreover, of quelling disorder: then your soldiers must be likened to spoilt children; they are useless for any practical purpose.\u2019\u2019 Sun Tzu, The Art of War. Napoleon hides behind nice words and he had to do it. \u2018\u2019 But Bonaparte\u2019s dreams of an empire in the middle East were quickly shattered. The British Admiral Horatio Nelson caught the French fleet anchored off the Egyptian coast and blew it to pieces. Bonaparte and 35,000 soldiers were trapped in Egypt. Youssef: The only link that he had with France were his ships, his fleet of war ships. You can imagine what a disaster this was. He was forced to stay in Egypt and live with the Egyptians, to find his bread and water in Egypt, and even the ammunition for his weapons in Egypt. Cut off from France, Bonaparte remained undaunted. Installed in a palace in Cairo, he imagined himself an eastern potentate, following in the footsteps of Alexander the Great. \u2018\u2019 Source of the quoted paragraphs: Napoleon: Napoleon at War A guest and invader at the same time, Napoleon made the right choice of saying good words about Turks and Egyptians. He was dependent on them. However two sayings attributed to Napoleon which I am fully agree with: \u2018\u2019 Give Me a Turkish Army. I will Conquer world\u2019\u2019 and especially : \u201cIf I had not been defeated in Acre against Jezzar Pasha of Turk. I would conquer all of the East.\u2019\u2019 Napoleon Bonaparte ",

            "answer_text": "Did he defeated Turks really easily ? I don\u2019t think so. In the naval battle of Ebuh\u0131r ( Battle of Nile) , he lost all of his navy to Royal Navy.  Admiral Nelson who crushed the French navy in the Battle of Nile He was defeated disastrously in the siege of Akka, lost two of his Generals ( General Bon and General Kefarelli ) Because of the harsh defence during siege and determined following operation of Cezzar Ahmet Pasha, he could barely managed to arrive in Yafa. The arrival of the tenant of Rhodes, Hasan Bey with the modern Ottoman Units ( Nizam-\u0131 Cedit ) deterriorated the situation for Napoleon. Eventually, he left his army in Egypt and fled to France secretly.  Cezzar Ahmet Pasha In 1805, Napoleon asserted that if he had: been able to take Acre [in 1799], I would have put on a turban, I would have made my soldiers wear big Ottoman trousers, and I would have exposed them to battle only in case of extreme necessity. I would have made them into a Sacred Battalion--my Immortals. I would have finished the war against the Ottomans with Arabic, Greek, and Armenian troops. Instead of a battle in Moravia, I would have won a Battle of Issus, I would have made myself emperor of the East, and I would have returned to Paris by way of Constantinople. [4] I am not sure this is an easy win. I doubt whether it is a win. ",
