            "answer_text": "Let me start be prefacing that I am *not* a Republican, let alone a fan of Donald Trump. I consider myself an ex-Democrat. I answer this coming from an Independent\u2019s perspective. Simply put, it would seem that a video clip has been identified and shared of a wire- or at least, something thus resembling- poking out from within Biden\u2019s jacket, to which he seems to lower his head now and again.  I\u2019ll spare you my heartfelt lament on how it made me feel to see this. If anyone would like to explain to me whether this is indeed what it seems to be, and why or why not, you\u2019d have my gratitude. Otherwise I have little choice but to believe what I see. Goodness knows four years of 45 spewing folly and division on camera has made that clear. In my opinion this leaves the question open of just how well Biden would debate impromptu, without preparation time. Unlike a lot of folks, I won\u2019t go so far as to say that I think that this necessarily disproves Biden could hold his own in a debate - however, I do think now the onus is on him to prove that he can, of which I\u2019m eager to see. 10/1/2020 Update: A couple of things. First: I am very grateful to the responses to this concern of mine, demonstrating as well as explaining: The \u201cwire\u201d does, in fact, seem to be a shirt crease. To each person who shared this, thank you; Secondly; At least one person has suggested I wrote this with the intention of detracting from Biden\u2019s legitimacy. Others may suggest the same. I want to dispel this. I don\u2019t particularly like Biden, but I have no intention of trying\u2026 what was suggested. I\u2019ve been coming to terms with voting for him to oust Trump, in fact; Wire or none, gaffs and all, Biden\u2019s a more dignified man and less incompetent at least than our current \u201cpresident\u201d. I wrote my answer because I genuinely had limited understanding of the situation, and I needed to answers. Fairness and a willingness to question our own matters in addressing concerns about our candidates; I\u2019ve spent about three years watching a man get away with his fanbase never bothering to question him, and this above all else I vow not to be.

            "answer_text": "This ridiculous RWNJ conspiracy theory tactic is getting so old hat it is beginning to sound like paranoia.These still pics from videos are as much a fantasy of the right as are pictures of flying saucers or pictures of \u2018messages in the clouds\u2019 and \u2018alien landing strips in South America\u2019. The mango Mussolini lost the debate so badly in the opinion of most reasonable and thinking people that tRump cultists simply HAVE to invent any story to discredit his opponent no matter how ludicrously far fetched it is. Some people are so dumb or so unbelievably biased that they will believe ANYTHING which contributes to their cognitive dissonance.Of course Joe Biden was not wearing a wire - the massive trolling campaign from the cultists proves that more conclusively than anything else. This tactic of driving the narrative by keeping asking the question so it becomes part of the political \u2018folklore\u2019 is a classic Goebbels propaganda technique \u2014\u201cIf you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State.\u201d Republicans are so desperate to hide the massive dissent engendered by tRump\u2019s continuous lies that they come up with bigger and bigger lies to divert attention and supress proper debate.
