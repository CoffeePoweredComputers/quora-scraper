            "answer_text": "Rap/Hip-Hop beats are made in music making software. These are called DAWS, which stands for Digital Audio Work Station. The 4 main DAWS that most producers are Ableton, FL Studio, Logic Pro, and Pro Tools. Typically, the person making the beat will lay down a melody by placing the keys that they want to use in the melody in the correct sequence. However, sometimes the person making the beat may find a sample they would like to use in their beat from online, and use it while possibly adding some effects to it, editing it, or reversing it. After this, they\u2019ll either make another melody or move on to the drums. The drums of a modern day trap/rap song usually consist of An eighth note hi hat pattern that continues straight through the song, which the producer programs inA clap/snare on every third beatA kick that goes in some of the same spots the hi hats (It should be in the beginning of the drum loop always)A 808, which is a type of sub-bass, it\u2019s always in the same key as the melody, and usually follows the kick pattern with some variationAfter this is all programmed in, the composer of the beat will arrange it how they choose, and if all goes well someone ends up rapping on it. I hope I answered your question adequately. Thanks, and have a nice day! ",

            "answer_text": "Rappers don\u2019t don\u2019t make beats unless they are a beatmaker also. Also! Understand that a beatmaker is not a producer or songwriter. Beatmakers create music from previous songs/records. Beatmakers are the people who basically do nothing but sample other artist music or buy loops online, chop it up and recreate something new from it. They don\u2019t compose any original music really. The only thing they probably compose are the drums and/or bass. A rapper is an artist, which can be a lyricist or songwriter. Beatmakers or Producers use computer software to assist them with the music they create for a rapper. Programs like Pro Tools, Logic Pro X, Ableton Live, Cubase and Studio One are software programs that are used for production. With these programs you can create music on the go. Any and everywhere.
