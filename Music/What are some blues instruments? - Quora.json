            "answer_text": "Tl;dr Two guitars,  harmonica,  piano,  bass,  and drums.  The archetypal blues band is the band Muddy Waters formed in Chicago in the early 1950's.  This band was responsible for staples of the cannon like \"Hoochie Coochie Man,\" \"I'm Ready,\" and \"I Just Want to Make Love to You.\"  All subsequent blues bands were aware of this juggernaut.  The line-up consisted of: Muddy Waters: guitar and vocals Little Walter Jacobs: harmonica Jimmy Rogers: guitar Otis Spann: piano Elgin Evans: drums A bass player (Willie Dixon on many studio recordings) As players went in and out (many,  like Little Walter left to form their own band), he generally kept this line-up. So,  while you don't need to have all these elements,  this line-up is the most standard.  A couple notes: A horn player,  or 3-piece horn section, is optional. Reliance on larger horn sections with orchestrated parts begins to drift from the core of electric blues (see BB King's band,  Albert King's Stax recordings,  or Elmore James). There is typically not a distinction made between lead and rhythm guitar,  as blues guitar players are expected to do both. However,  many front-men/vocalists (Muddy, BB, Albert,  Freddie King) only play lead,  as opposed to rock music,  where guitarist/vocalists tend to play rhythm guitar. Any other instrument is considered non-standard,  but may be acceptable in context (Gatemouth Brown's fiddle,  auxiliary percussion such as washboard, Hammond organ).  ",

            "answer_text": "The most common would be probably exactly what you would think. Guitar, bass, drums, sometimes piano, for some flair horns (like bacon to a blues song), and maybe a choir if it\u2019s more of a gospel blues band. Really there is no limitation to what \u201ccould\u201d be used for a blues band, but you asked common and I believe what I listed to be common A.F. Why you ask? Well blues is an old genre of music. The earliest form of blues had its roots in the slave fields of the Mississippi delta. Variations of old slave and religous songs. Later when guitars and electricity were invented and reasonably priced for the general public, those same songs and/or variants of those songs, were played on the new super awesome, totally wicked instruments that became the weapon of choice for those that played the blues. Personally I think it was because electric guitars were so new, and sounded so raw cranked up in the blues clubs back in the 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s when blues started to spread from the delta, much how synthesizers have grabbed the younger generation, it was a new sound that was a total departure from what everyone thought they knew about music and how it could be played.
