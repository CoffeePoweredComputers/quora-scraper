            "answer_text": "In the Navy we did not salute if we were indoors (and on a ship one is always \u201cindoors\u201d) because you can\u2019t be spending all of your time saluting every time you pass every officer. And from the Captain\u2019s perspective - can you imagine saluting every single enlisted person and junior officer (in other words, every single person on the vessel) as you walk around? The Navy realized that it\u2019s dumb to make sailors salute officers - even the Captain - when they\u2019re belowdecks on a ship. On a spaceship, everywhere is \u201cbelowdecks.\u201d Besides - can you imagine how incredibly boring it would be to see Kirk salute a dozen times walking from his stateroom to the Bridge, another dozen times on his way to the Sick Bay, still more when he ducks into Astrometrics, returning salutes every time someone new walks onto the Bridge, and so forth?

However, in Season 1, Episode 19 Tomorrow Is Yesterday he explains to Captain John Christopher \u201cWe are a combined service.\u201d Were Starfleet a military organization, they would most likely follow Naval traditions and in the U.S. Navy, they do not salute when uncovered (no hat) which is true when indoors aboard ship. If you are really Jonesing for a salute, watch TOS: Mirror, Mirror and you can witness the Terran Salute.  ",
