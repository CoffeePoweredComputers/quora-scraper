            "answer_text": "The famous one, for my generation at least, is \u2018House of the Rising Sun\u2019, As popularised by \u2018the Animals\u2019. It was a traditional folk song, born in the mists of time. Bob Dylan, amongst countless others, had done interminable variations of it. A tale of misery and dissolution commonplace in the blues tradition. A constantly evolving, hand to mouth evergreen. The Animals, at a loss for anything else to record, settled on what was effectively a standard. They each contributed to the best of their abilities. Hilton Valentine\u2019s arrpegiated guitar work and Eric Burdon\u2019s eloquent rendition on vocals are standout. Alan Price, the Animal\u2019s keyboarder arranged a version for the purposes of a single release. Very successfully, as it turned out. As the story goes, put on the spot, all members of the band, in good faith, agreed that Alan\u2019s name would go on the credits. So guess who reaped the dividends? In millions. No doubt the band members, to a man, regretted their decision at leisure. ",
