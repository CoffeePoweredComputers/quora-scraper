As we all know, Spotify music is protected by DRM, so that you cannot freely play them in any other places. So, you may need the help of a third-party tool like Spotify music converter. Then just follow the four steps to transfer music from Spotify to Google play. Step 1. Drag Spotify playlists to TunesKit Firstly, run TunesKit Music Converter for Spotify. Then you have two choices to add the Spotify playlists to the converter. The first one is dragging the playlists from the Spotify app to the conversion window of TunesKit. Or you can copy the link of the Spotify track to the search box of the TunesKit interface. Step 2. Set the output audio parameters Now simply go \"Menu > Preference > Convert\" to adjust the output preferences as you like. You are allowed to choose the output format, channel, bit rate, and sample rate. Currently, TunesKit Music Converter for Spotify fully supports some plain formats like MP3, M4A, AAC, WAV, FLAC, and M4B. You can also set the output directory and conversion speed here. Step 3. Convert protected Spotify to common audios After the above setting, click the \"Convert\" button to start converting Spotify music to MP3 or other formats. After the conversion, the output folder will be open automatically. You can also find the converted Spotify music files by navigating to \"Converted > Search\". Step 4. Transfer the converted Spotify music to Google Play Click the \"Upload Music\" button, and you'll be prompted to download the Music Manager. If you've already got it, then simply open it up and sign in with your Google account. Select the \"Menu icon > Upload songs to Google Play\", and hit Next. Select the \"Other Folder\" option to click the \"Next\" button, then locate the folder where you store Spotify music from the popup window. The Music Manager will automatically upload Spotify music files you select to Google Play. ",
