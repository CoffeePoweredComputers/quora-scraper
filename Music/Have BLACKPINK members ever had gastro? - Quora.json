            "answer_text": "Not that I am aware of, but even if they did, which is normal at some times, why would they let us know. They don't have reveal everything they did in life and very detail, the nitty and gritty ones. As idols, their job is to give them their music that their fans want to hear and also give them a glimpse of their real life, but nothing too personal that would make the fans worry and pry into their personal life, which they need and deserve. If you are to reveal to someone you have a gastro, how would they feel. They would probably be worried about your heath and overwhelm you with questions, if they care about you, which would make you feel like you are burdening them with your problems. As idols, that guilt is even triple the amount because they would reveal it to a million people in the world who have that same connection with them, and care about their health and well being, and for the sake of their privacy and safety, they would try to be careful with their words and actions, so they don't spark or incite any unwanted attention to themselves and the group. I am sure that they have had gastro, but that is something they probably will never tell you because why do they need to. ",
