            "answer_text": "Not possible to classify your voice type just by range. I myself can sing E2 to C5. I was classified as a bass for some time, then bass baritone, then baritone, and eventually tenor. After this journey, I can choose the timbre, and sing as baritone (I won several competitions this way) or tenor (I also won several competitions this way). The Fach system is likely what you\u2019re thinking of when you ask for \u201cvoice type.\u201d It is a system created in Germany used to break down all voice types into boxes, and associate theater roles with them. It is basically taking the human voice and putting it in a spreadsheet. It is also (often) a rotten guide. It\u2019s a system of categorization made by administrators for administrators. Your voice is unique to you, and capable of so many colors and timbres and moments of beauty, that it is mind blowing. Just sharing this to say that voice type is a construct that you shouldn\u2019t view as Gospel. The most useful metric, I think, is answering two questions: (1) where does your voice sound the best? (2) where does your voice feel free and powerful? ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with Jacky Tasmin, If you can sing the low D-2 realy strong, than I would more than likely say your a bass. When my voice first dropped, the lowest I could sing was that D-2, but within a year it's settled down at an A-1 and all the way up to C-4. I can squeeze out a G-1, but it sounds terrible and too forced, so I don't count it as part of my range. If you can't sing that D-2 with some power and strength behind it, and you can barely squeeze it out, but you can sing the realy high notes well, then your a baritone. Hope I helped \\U0001f44d ",
