            "answer_text": "If you mean tune to a musical key, then a guitar in standard tuning is in a horrible E sound. You can improve the sound of playing all the strings open by changing the relative tuning of the strings. For example, you could try open D (DADF#AD). A simple strum of all the strings will sound a D major chord. To change the key the guitar is tuned to, you can add a capo - at the second fret, you have open E, at the third you have open F and so on. If you\u2019re more adventurous, try the DADGAD (aka Dsus) tuning. This is a lot more advanced and you\u2019ll need to learn some complex chords\u2026 but it works wonderfully with some musical genres. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm assuming you mean changing the pitch that you tuned to, rather than an open tuning.  In other words instead of A being 440hz it is a lower or higher frequency.  This is often necessary when playing along to songs as many weren't recorded at concert pitch, have been recorded on tape then varispeeded or pitch schifted digitally.  It's fairly simple once you know how to tune.   Essentially just find a note that you know is in the song, drop down below it and then tune up.  I've done a video tutorial explaining this in more details:      ",
