            "answer_text": "I think it could either be two things, one could be that you are sentimental for the music of your childhood. If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ve been there. Recently I started listening to Blink 182 again. However that doesn\u2019t speak to the quality of the music, it\u2019s just my own sentimentality attached to it. Or it could be that older music is much better. Just consider the music of Postmodern Jukebox, which reimagines popular songs as 20s and 30s style, many of which are far superior than the original song. Here are some examples. Bad Romance - Lady Gaga (reimagined as a 1920's flapper style)  Umbrella - Rhianna Vintage (reimagined as a 1930s vaudeville type song)  As you can see, my favorite videos are the ones that feature the tap dancing women. You know what the best part if them is? They are captioned! ",

            "answer_text": "Old music has a unique vibe. New music, especially those starting from 2013 are way too perfect and edgy, and lyrics are also too complicated to get the message. Pop songs from the 60\u2019s to 90\u2019s have the right balance of perfect and emphasizes creativity, and it\u2019s also really catchy that anyone can enjoy! I still listen to new music, but it has been a while since I last listened to English pop songs. I feel lost somewhere between Istanbul and Tokyo since 2016, but that\u2019s okay. ",
