            "answer_text": "I used to know down to the minute how much a Tier 1 channel vs a Tier 2 channel was actual content vs commercial time. I haven't worked directly with ad insertion since 2016, so someone else may have more current information. So a Tier 1 service like Fox News or Discovery Channel will have 5 commercial insertion periods per hour of programming. Tier 2 services have 4 per hour. Each ad insertion period lasts for 4 minutes. So on a Tier 1 channel you will have 40 minutes of actual content per hour and 20 minutes of advertising per hour. A Tier 2 service like Lifetime or BET will have an extra. 4 minutes of content per hour (44 minutes) and only 16 minutes of advertising per hour. There aren't any laws or rules that determine how much advertising a channel can have, it is determined by the owner of the service. If a channel is very popular and they have enough advertisers who are willing to pay to air their ads on a channel then the owner can decide to add another commercial break to their hour of programming. This has changed over time, and is the reason you will see the credits of TV show being scrolled very quickly in a screen within the video while the next episode is already starting. By running the programs closer together the channel owner can open up more time for advertising. I see this all the time on TBS. For older programs like Brady Bunch, Lost in Space, Original Twilight Zone, Hitchcock hour, and so on\u2026 you will find that the programs were 48 to 52 minutes of actual content vs 12 to 8 minutes of advertising. The TV channel owners have, over time, conditioned the American TV viewers to accept more commercials and less content. A 1970's half hour comedy program was longer than today's half hour comedy program. This is also why it is easier to air content from about the same age together, think Nick at Night when they play old shows like Bewitched, I Dream of Jeannie, etc\u2026 they were all about the same length because they were all made about the same time.

            "answer_text": "What percentage of TV is commercials? I don\u2019t know about anywhere else, but in the U.S. a half-hour commercial network sitcom has 22 minutes of content, leaving eight minutes for commercials, station IDs and PSAs. The numbers project similarly for longer shows. That\u2019s almost 27% of the stuff most people don\u2019t want to see. If one pre-records, one can zip by these stretches and view three half-hour shows per a bit more than an hour. If one streams and doesn\u2019t pay extra for a commercial-free subscription, they are wasting over a quarter of their screen watching life. ",
