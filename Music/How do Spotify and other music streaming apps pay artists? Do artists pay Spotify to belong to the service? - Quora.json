            "answer_text": "If you look at the percentages they aren\u2019t paying the artist terribly much. I would guess they spend more money on licensing than paying artist. I think the number on artist pay is something less than a tenth of a cent per stream, that is pretty fucking sad! I don\u2019t know how this figure became the norm, but it seems to be the case for now. Spotify is actually somehow losing money at a consistent rate. Apple has some kind of device to sell to keep them in the black(kind of like Kindle and it\u2019s reader), I don\u2019t think Spotify has anything to go with their stealing services. They do subscriptions, I don\u2019t know how many paying subscribers they have? but it does sound like their business model has a Titanic size hole in it. As far as I know, artist don\u2019t have to pay to be ripped off by Spotify, they\u2019re willing to do it free of charge. Thanks! Robert ",

            "answer_text": "Most, if not all, use a third party company to tally all the plays for each artist, and give a report to the streaming service as to how much money needs to be payed to a music label. The label in tern pays the artists. If you\u2019re an independent artist, I\u2019m assuming the procedure would be pretty much the same, there are third party services that collect money for independent artists. As far as your last question, I\u2019m not sure. But I do know that most artists pay a company to help promote them, and that includes navigating through the process of getting on Spotify. ",
