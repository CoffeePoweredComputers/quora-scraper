            "answer_text": "In my opinion, the best 50 Cent and Eminem collaboration is in Patiently Waiting from 50 Cent's debut album 'Get Rich or Die Tryin' which is arguably the best debut rap album of all time. Despite it never being officially released as a single and years before streaming services this song reached 56 on the Hot 100 which speaks for itself. The song is pretty well written and has some really good lines. Apart from that, it is one of my favorite 50 Cent record. ",
