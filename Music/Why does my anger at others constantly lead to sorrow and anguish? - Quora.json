            "answer_text": "Because anger is an emotion that when directed at others is going to hurt them in some way. We do not need to wait until we get angry to resolve difficulties, and we do not need to choose anger in response to some action. People think that anger is a normal and natural emotion to experience in response to life, and do not realise that we actually get to choose how we are going to respond. Two people could have the same act done against them, and one could get angry and the could remain calm and resolve the situation calmy. Anger is of course going to lead to sorrow and anguish, because when we really immerse ourselves we can lose control over our behaviour. It does not excuse how we act, but it is a dangerous emotion to allow to take us over. To learn to get on top of your emotions and choose how you are going to respond, I recommend an \u2018Anger Management Course\u2019 either online or if there are courses run in your local area, they are better attended live, because then you get to know some great people by the end of the course. Once you have mastered how to prevent destructive anger, learn to be an \u2018Observer\u2019 in your mind, and when things happen, you have a couple of seconds to choose how to respond. Use that time to breathe, then go about resolving it in a calm and respectful way. This way, conflicts, disputes or happenings can be resolved in a way that leads to self respect, and not anguish and sorrow. All the best. It is a sign you are ready to change that you are asking this now. It shows a maturity of character :-) ",

            "answer_text": "When we get angry the brain produces various chemicals that creates negative emotions or feelings. I suggest you look up these chemicals. When these chemicals are produce they affects the glands that monitor and controll how we feel. For this reason the Bible notes never to let the fun go down on our anger. It depends on how long we hold the anger. The sorrow and anguish comes from the reaction of the chemical on the body and mind. Remember we get stress just on thought alone so just imagine the damages when we are emersed in anger. ",
