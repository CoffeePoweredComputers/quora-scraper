            "answer_text": "Because Byron Hadley is a maladjusted and sadistic brute who will beat on anyone given the slightest opportunity. Granted, Boggs happens to richly deserve such a savage beating as he and his fellow \u201cSisters\u201d beat Andy Dufresne nearly to death in the latest in a sequence of such attacks, at least some of which probably included rape, or at least attempted rape. Not long before the latter incident Andy tells Hadley about a way he can keep a sum of money he inherited and not lose any to tax. Hadley repays this favor by beating Boggs so badly he renders him an invalid. But Hadley could have just put the word out that Andy was under his protection after Andy does him that huge favor\u2014actually, if I\u2019m not mistaken, this is what happens in the book. But the movie-Hadley waits until after Andy is attacked (it\u2019s not terribly likely Hadley doesn\u2019t know Andy is being victimized by the Sisters) so he can have an excuse to exact violent retribution on Boggs. I think the brutal nature of Hadley was heightened for the film, which I think works better for the story. ",

When Boggs and the sisters put Andy in the hospital, Byron Hadley enacted revenge on Andy\u2019s behalf. He also was a very violent man who reveled in his position of power which allowed him the opportunity to beat the inmates. ",
