            "answer_text": "Everybody's brain is wired differently. Some people are adept in learning the lyrics of a song after hearing it once. But others have to repeatedly hear the song and write down the lyrics to reproduce it later. That's quite natural and can be considered perfectly normal. The musical capabilities are basically processed in the temporal lobe of brain. The lyrics which represents verbal aspects of musical memory is processed by the left hemisphere. Where as the intonation, pitch, timber and melody of the music is processed by the right temporal lobe. It might happen that someone's brain is naturally wired better on the left side so that the verbal memories of lyrics are easily remembered. Where as some may be more inclined to listen to the tune of the song because their right brain is more efficient. Moreover, lyrics of a song are not logical or confirming to the routine grammatical structure making it difficult to memorize. Some songs have lyrics which are haphazard and disconnected that makes it even more difficult to remember the lyrics offhand. Lyrics can be memorized effectively by writing it down and repeating it often so that it sticks to our mind. As the adage goes practice makes perfect ! In a lighter vein, we tend to remember the melody of the song when we are happy and brood over the lyrics only when we are sad !! ",
