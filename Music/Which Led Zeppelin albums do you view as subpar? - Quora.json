I have various levels of greatness for them\u2026 Level 1: Physical Graffiti Presence III The Song Remains the Same The first album Level 2: II How the West Was Won BBC Sessions Level 3: The fourth album Houses of the Holy Coda In Through the Our Door I love every Zep album. Even my least favorites aren't sub par\u2026 Incidentally, I don't consider Celebration Day as a Zeppelin album, but an awesome tribute, since Little Bonzo isn't his father, but he turns in an incredible performance\u2026 ",

It has basically no thought put into it. All of the songs are just leftovers from previous recording sessions. It only exists to fulfill a contract the band had with their record label. They didn't wanna record new stuff after Bonham was gone so Jimmy Page gathered a bunch of these old songs. ",

I have never owned \u201cIn Through the Out Door\u201d (1979) or \u201cCoda\u201d (1982) and find both subpar compared to their first six albums. There are fine moments on these albums but nothing like what used to be. ",
