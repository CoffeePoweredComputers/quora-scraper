            "answer_text": "Depends. You asked a very general question, so I\u2019ll give a very general response. Yes, it\u2019s good in the sense that that there\u2019s a ton of musicians here that you can network with, jam with, form projects with, record with, and the like. However, nobody\u2019s making money from their recordings anymore, not even famous legendary bands are making much from their recordings. Recordings now are basically a calling card to bring attention to you as a songwriter, performer, or both. It\u2019s not so easy to get paid as a songwriter nowadays, things aren\u2019t as cut and dried as they used to be. The club scene in L.A. is rough. What I mean by that is that bands get paid very little, and more often than not, are forced into the \u201cPay To Play\u201d system where it actually costs a band to play at a club. If the band has zero marquee value, you will be paying to play, and that really sucks. If a band member has credentials, has played or recorded with a big name band, then the band has a chance of actually getting paid. If anybody arrives in L.A. thinking that they\u2019re going to make a living only playing clubs, they are in for a rude awakening. Someone mentioned studio work. There\u2019s very little of that kind of work left, not like the days of decades past when you had the Wrecking Crew and guys like Tommy Tedesco making serious bread as a studio musician. Nowadays a producer recording music for a TV commercial is most likely recording in his home studio with a few buddies helping him out. It doesn't help that L.A. is a very expensive city to live in; apartment rentals are through the roof, so delusions of life as a starving artist may get you a one-way ride into homelessness on the streets. The homeless population is huge and out of control. There\u2019s a big lack of housing here, and landlords charge accordingly. Be prepared. I know some musicians and singers who CouchSurf around L.A., bouncing around from one place to another to avoid paying rent, but I would never recommend for anyone to do that in L.A. Kinda risky on many levels. TOURING is basically the last way that bands have a shot of making money. But touring costs money, lots of it, and a band has to have a very large national following in order for the tour to turn even a small profit. So it\u2019s not just any band that can tour successfully. Sorry to sound somewhat pessimistic, but making a living full-time as a musician in Los Angeles in 2019 is no cakewalk. Other work-related skills, a college degree, anything that could help should be completed before arriving here. ",

            "answer_text": "I would not know, having never lived there. However, if it\u2019s like NY, NY, a city where I did live and work as a jazz musician, I would think it is a very \u201cinsider\u201d city musically. LA probably is a good city for musicians who do studio work for movies and TV - more so than in clubs. Back in the 1970s, there was a huge pop and rock scene there, acts like Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, the Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, and Frank Zappa were all based there. Now\u2026.? ",
