            "answer_text": "Many metal vocalists have good voices, though in general they aren\u2019t in death or black metal. Although Tool doesn\u2019t like to be called a metal band, their frontman Maynard James Keenan has a good voice. Chino Moreno of Deftones has a good voice. Many people like David Draiman\u2019s voice, he sings for Disturbed. I have a ton of respect for him but never cared for his voice. Blind Guardian\u2019s Hansi K\u00fcrsch has an amazing voice. Conception and former Kamelot frontman Roy Khan is great. Classic metal vocalists like Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden and Rob Halford of Judas Priest are noted vocalists. A lot of fan\u2019s favorite vocalist is the late Ronnie James Dio, solo-artist, frontman for Black Sabbath, Rainbow, and Elf. Many traditional and power metal vocalists are excellent. Generally metal performers are proficient and talented with whatever instrument they play including vocals. ",

            "answer_text": "King Diamond has a surprisingly strong voice. His vocals and technique of using falsetto is something out of this world. He is getting up in age but I had a chance to see him twice in the 80s and in 2019. The 2019 concert was absolutely amazing. His vocals were top tier. From the growls to the high falsetto. The vocals are so much better with age with the King. His guitarist are second to none. His stage shows are still amazing. Opening the show was Idol hands and Uncle Acid and the deadbeats. Uncle acid did great and sounded EXCELLENT. But when the King was close to start the place was packed. Everyone loved that show. ",
