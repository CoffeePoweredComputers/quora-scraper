            "answer_text": "\"That's so Raven about\" was the popular sitecom appeared in Disney Channel. Series which compells us to laugh that's what I heard from my folks. The main characters were Raven-Symone and Orlando Bloom. So, after researching in google about the characters following were my findings: 1. Raven-Symon\u00e9  Following That\u2019s So Raven, the show\u2019s leading lady hasn\u2019t been as lucky with her acting projects. In between lending her voice to some animated shows, she starred as Georgia on the short-lived ABC show State of Georgia. Raven has also been active in the music studio, although she recently admitted she\u2019s not working on an album. 2. Orlando Bloom  After That's So Raven, Orlando managed to keep his name in the news -- but not for good things. In 2007 he was arrested for possession of marijuana and in 2010 he got a DUI. He was arrested for a second time in May 2012 for failing to meet his probation conditions. Brown was arrested again in July 2012 when he failed to show up for court.For now, he seems to be staying out of the legal and public eyes. 3.Kyle Massey (Cori)  Kyle remained in the Disney family with roles in Cory in the House and  Fish Hooks after That's So Raven ended. He also came in second place onDancing With the Stars in 2010 4. Anneliese van der Pol  After the show, she appeared in the spoof film Vampires Suck in 2010. She\u2019s also been very active in the world of live theater. Most recently, she was the title character in the Arizona Theater Company\u2019s musical production of Emma. This is not my content, i got the data from the sources: starcasm.net, Teen.com - Videos, Entertainment, Fashion, Music, and Celebrity News for Teens. As Far as i read about the show, it was an amazing show started in 2002 recognized  for  wittiest and sarcastic moments of Ravens. ",
