            "answer_text": "I would have to say Paul was the most musically diverse of the Beatles in two ways. First, Paul was far and away the most multi talented Beatle instrumentally. Not only was he a phenomenal bass guitarist, he could also play acoustic guitar well (see e.g. Yesterday, Blackbird) and electric guitar (that's him doing the lead guitar on songs like Ticket to Ride, Taxman and he and George doing harmonic guitar solos on And Your Bird Can Sing). He also was the best keyboard player in the band and could even play the drums! Secondly, McCartney was the most eclectic and far reaching in his musical styles, everything from raucous rhythm and blues type music (I \u2019m Down, Get Back), pop rock (What Your Doing), soft ballads (Here, There and Everywhere, And I Love Her), classical (Yesterday, Eleanor Rigby), early jazz-rock (Got to Get You Into My Life), country and western (Rocky Raccoon), psychedelic rock (Sergeant Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band), early proto heavy metal (Helter Skelter), English Dance Hall (Your Mother Should Know). This is not an exhaustive list but gives you the idea! All four of the Beatles were talented and sought inspiration in different musical genres but Sir Paul was far and away the most diverse! ",

            "answer_text": "As a musician yes. I think as a songwriter, though great, he was the one we could rely on for the constant silly love songs or a story song. I think John was the most diverse in the songwriting arena. ",
