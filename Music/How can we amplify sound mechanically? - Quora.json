            "answer_text": "There used to be these devices called compressed air gramophones in the early 1900s. The principle behind these devices was quite simple - modulation of a compressed air column. The 'input' signal (sound waves in your case, gramophone needle here) would excite a diaphragm which would in turn excite a sensitive mechanical contraption. This mechanical contraption would cause corresponding undulations in the compressed column of air which is forced out through a mouthpiece. Of course, building the whole thing would be a vastly complicated venture, and you would end up with an amplifier with abysmal efficiency compared to the electronic ones currently available.   Pictured above, the glorious Auxetophone - the most famous compressed air gramophone (Source: Victor Auxetophone). Another obvious solution would be to use a \"horn\". Although a horn doesn't really \"amplify\" anything. It is just an impedance transformer - it tries to match the impedance b/w the source of the sound (your mouth) and the destination (air). This way there is less reflection of sound and, consequently, more transmission. Ref:1. Compressed air gramophone2. Auxetophone Technical Comments ",
