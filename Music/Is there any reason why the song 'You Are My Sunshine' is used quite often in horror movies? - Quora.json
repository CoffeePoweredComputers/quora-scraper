            "answer_text": "The song is actually quite creepy when you pay attention to the lyrics. I'm posting them in full, so scroll past if you don't want to read it all: The other night dear, as I lay sleeping I dreamed I held you in my arms But when I awoke, dear, I was mistaken So I hung my head and I cried You are my sunshine, my only sunshine You make me happy when skies are gray You'll never know dear, how much I love you Please don't take my sunshine away I'll always love you and make you happy If you will only say the same But if you leave me and love another You'll regret it all some day You are my sunshine, my only sunshine You make me happy when skies are gray You'll never know dear, how much I love you Please don't take my sunshine away You told me once, dear, you really loved me And no one else could come between But now you've left me and love another You have shattered all of my dreams You are my sunshine, my only sunshine You make me happy when skies are gray You'll never know dear, how much I love you Please don't take my sunshine away In all my dreams, dear, you seem to leave me When I awake my poor heart pains So when you come back and make me happy I'll forgive you dear, I'll take all the blame You are my sunshine, my only sunshine You make me happy when skies are gray You'll never know dear, how much I love you Please don't take my sunshine away I shouldn't have to explain, but the lyrics seem somewhat threatening and depressing to me. This also makes it the perfect music for a horror movie: it sounds childlike and innocent at first, but once you pay attention, it's scary and shocking. Everything is scarier when it comes from something you'd normally assume to be harmless. ",

            "answer_text": "Because it is a children\u2019s song and children\u2019s songs and lullabies are indelibly creepy when sung in a monotone\u2026 and by weird and creepy people with murderous intentions. Somewhere along the line, filmmakers realized that if a lunatic is chasing you and trying to kill you \u2014 that it\u2019s creepier if they\u2019re doing something associated with innocence, like singing a nursery rhyme. \u201c1, 2 Freddy\u2019s coming for you!3, 4 Better lock your door.5, 6 Grab your crucifix. 7, 8 Can you stay awake? 9, 10 Never sleep again.\u201d I will point out that Freddy Krueger is a monster that kills you in your dreams. So, not falling asleep is of paramount importance. Sung in a slow, meandering, innocent monotone there are few things as terrifying as a lullaby. Try it out for yourself as you\u2019re attempting to murder your significant other, they will freak out a lot more if (as you\u2019re stalking them around the abandoned cabin with a knife) you\u2019re ominously chanting the \u201calphabet song\u201d as you do so. Did you ever realize that the \u201calphabet song\u201d, \u201ctwinkle twinkle little star\u201d, and \u201cbaa baa black sheep\u201d all have the exact same melody? They do, you can google it. I\u2019ll wait. Wild, right? It\u2019s also public domain so no one has to pay any rights to use it.  Oh Dear! You\u2019ve gotten blood everywhere! ",
