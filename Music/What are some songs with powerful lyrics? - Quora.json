            "answer_text": "Songs according to me which have very powerful lyrics and the reasons why so: John Lennon: Imagine\u2014 This song has the intro lyrics as:\u201cImagine there's no heavenIt's easy if you tryNo hell below usAbove us only skyImagine all the people living for today Imagine there's no countriesIt isn't hard to doNothing to kill or die forAnd no religion too\u201d. This song was written by John Lennon in the year 1971. This was a song from the critically acclaimed album of his solo career. It has a powerful message for all the people fighting, yearning for our own selfish reasons and demands. According to Lennon, the following was the concept behind the song \u2018Imagine\u2019: \u201cThe concept of positive prayer ... If you can imagine a world at peace, with no denominations of religion\u2014not without religion but without this my God-is-bigger-than-your-God thing\u2014then it can be true ... the World Church called me once and asked, \"Can we use the lyrics to 'Imagine' and just change it to 'Imagine one religion'?\" That showed [me] they didn't understand it at all. It would defeat the whole purpose of the song, the whole idea.\u201d 2. Sia: Big Girls Cry \u2014 The song has pre chorus and chorus lyrics as- I'm at home, on my ownCheck my phone, nothing, thoughAct busy, order inPay TV, it\u2019s agony I may cry ruinin' my makeupWash away all the things you've takenAnd I don't care if I don\u2019t look pretty This song is based on the widely known concept of her life as a celebrity and the responsibility she has to acquire just to feed the never ending want by the masses and the idea about the celebrity\u2019s social responsibility towards them. She tries to run away from the responsibility but is unable to and her fear keeps on getting bigger and bigger to fight this. The other interpretation is the bad relationship one comes in and fights against it but one can\u2019t do anything about it. 3. A great big world and Cristina Aguillera: Say Something \u2014 The chorus has lyrics such as- \u201cSay something, I'm giving up on youI'm sorry that I couldn't get to youAnywhere, I would've followed youSay something, I'm giving up on you And I will swallow my prideYou're the one that I love\u201d Unlike other songs, where there is one meaning to its concept behind it, this can have different meanings. It is open for interpretation to the listeners. There are many more songs as such but I personally prefer these songs. ",
