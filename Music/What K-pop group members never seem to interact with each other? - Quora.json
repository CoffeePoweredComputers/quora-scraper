            "answer_text": "NCT For the people who don\u2019t know NCT. NCT is boy group under SM Entertainment with 21 members (18 not including WayV), NCT has 3 sub unit groups NCT U, NCT 127, and NCT Dream and their Chinese group WayV. WayV is not technically NCT but has NCT members. Now to the question. :) What kpop group members never seem to interact with each other? I would say NCT because you never really see them as a whole just sub units. We seen as a whole only a couple times (weekly idol and some end-of-the-year shows). In NCT there are members who are only a part of one sub unit so it would be natural if they didn\u2019t really talk/interact on camera, we don\u2019t know if they talk in their dorm on a regular basis.
