            "answer_text": "You ask, \u201cIs someone smarter if they can explain complicated stuff in simple terms so that everyone can understand compared to someone who cannot do so?\u201d I imagine that there are concepts which are difficult or nearly impossible to explain in simple terms. However, if one considers the times when this is possible, I\u2019d say that people who can do this are displaying a certain type of intelligence which others may not possess. But does this make them smarter? Not necessarily because we all have different abilities and talents. We wouldn\u2019t say that a fiction writer is smarter than a nonfiction writer because he or she can create plots or that a painter of abstracts is smarter than a painter of objects. People\u2019s talents differ but can be equally valuable. ",

            "answer_text": " How could baby Hanuman travel to the Sun, which is 150 million milometers away and has a core temperature of 15 million degree Celsius?  How could baby Krishna lift Govardhan hill with his little finger. Is it possible to answers these complicated questions in a way even a layman can understand? Yes. The answer is that they are gods and capable of doing anything, even when they are children. Though such answers are extremely popular, they don\u2019t serve any purpose. It also makes believers to depend on gods for everything, with just blind faith.  Explaining the same using seven stage thinking mechanism on which they are based, will not make any sense to anyone. The advantage of such answers is that all such answers would be compatible among themselves and the knowledge works under all conditions. In short, anyone can understand anything based on Reasoning or abstract thinking. Most people can\u2019t understand anything based on Logic. We can see masters, who are supposed to have attained Enlightenment, answering questions about any subject on Earth with great fluency. If we put those answers together we realize that the answers are not compatible among themselves. Logic is superior to Reasoning. However, in this era Logic is universal and very sacred, and not something we shouldn\u2019t use in public. Therefore, anyone who explains everything in simple terms is not as ingenious as some people think. ",
