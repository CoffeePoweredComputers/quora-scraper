            "answer_text": "Led Zeppelin often recorded together live to create a basic track on to which other layers were later overdubbed. They would generally record several \u201ctakes\u201d of the same song in order to get the best version to use as a basic track. In My Time Of Dying is one of their longest songs, which would make it challenging for the whole band to play together without anyone making minor mistakes that would make the track unusable. After eleven minutes of rip-snortin\u2019 rock and roll, just as Robert Plant is singing the final lines of the song, someone (probably Bonham) coughs. Plant sings \u201ccough\u201d to acknowledge this, Page plays a humourous guitar fill, Bonham replies \u201cThat\u2019s gotta be the one, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d, meaning that this is the best take of the song, then (probably) engineer Ron Nevison can be heard on the talkback mic saying \u201ccome and have a listen mate\u201d. The cough would likely have been picked up on several microphones in the room, and as such likely couldn\u2019t be easily edited out without needing to re-do at least some the track. As the rest of the recording was satisfactory and the cough (and Page and Plant\u2019s response to it) isn\u2019t so much a mistake as a slice of studio life, reflective of a light, relaxed mood in the recording sessions, the decision was made to leave it in. It\u2019s also a bit of welcome light relief after Plant has spent eleven minutes screaming about death. As to why Plant sings rather than speaks the line, I suspect it\u2019s simply that the tape is still rolling and he hasn\u2019t properly finished the song, so he\u2019s still \u201con duty\u201d as the singer of a rock band recording an album.  John Bonham (cough not pictured) ",

            "answer_text": "A song about dying is a serious song and Led Zeppelin was being serious as they go through the song. At the end, however, they add the \u2018cough\u2019 to change the story somewhat. It\u2019s as if to say (yeah) we\u2019re dying but not right now. It is their way of interjecting humor to a serious subject. The contrast leads the listener away from the darkness of dying into the light of realistic life thus lightening the mood for one and all.
