            "answer_text": "Why don\u2019t you want to listen to music? Do you think God requires it of you? I know it is not explicitly in the Koran. A very devout Christian young man I once knew, was told by older Christians he respected that rock and roll was evil, So he destroyed all his vinyl records. (Yes this was long ago). Several years later, he was just as devout but regretted the destruction and loss of a harmless source of joy, on the word of people who really didn\u2019t know much about it. If you, yourself, really believe you shouldn\u2019t be listening, then it won\u2019t be a hardship to give up. However if you are only taking someone else\u2019s word, you should think critically until you know what is best for you spiritually. ",
