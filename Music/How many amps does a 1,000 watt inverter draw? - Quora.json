            "answer_text": "It doesn't (except for a bit of standby power) , until you hook up stuff to it, and then it depends on the voltage. Wattage/voltage = amp A typical 1000 watt load will require near to 100 amps on a 12v inverter, its less by calculation but there are also efficiency losses in converting the power so a 1000 watt load will pull more than 1000 watt from the energy source (battery I assume) so in this case I'd keep 100 amps in mind. If you only hook up a 100 watt TV to the inverter the load on battery may be 110-150 Watts so much less then 100a even if its a 10.000 watt inverter. A 24v setup would mean half the amperage ",

            "answer_text": "How much does it draw from the supply that runs it? This depends on (1) the input voltage it\u2019s running on (2) if 1000w is its output, it also depends the efficiency of the invertor. First you have to figure out #2, to learn the actual total power consumption of the invertor (output power plus its own internal losses that show up as heat). This will be 1000w divided by the efficiency, so if the efficiency for example is 90%, the total consumption will be 1000w / 0.90, or about 1110 watts. Then since wattage is the product of amps times volts, so the amps drawn will be the total power consumption divided by the voltage it\u2019s running on. If that\u2019s 12v from an automobile electric system, then continuing our example above, that would come to 1110w / 12v, or about 93 amps. ",
