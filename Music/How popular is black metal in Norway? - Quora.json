            "answer_text": "Not much at all. Rock in general, as well as Punk, and Metal is more accepted by the mainstream, and you can see quite a bit of normies at these kinds of concerts, but Black Metal really is still rather niche here. True, a fraction of normies, punks, skaters, teenage contrarians like this kind of music and might attend a gig or two, but bar a few big names from the 90s (Mayhem, Satyricon, Dimmu Borgir, Enslaved\u2026), Norwegian Black Metal bands rarely get much airplay or bookings. I guess most people are aware of the existence of the subculture and treat it as an oddity, but only very, very few people are actually involved with the movement over here. ",

            "answer_text": "The thing with Norwegian black metal, is that it is very popular with black metal fans abroad. They fill smaller concert venues in Norway, too, but they don\u2019t attract the same crowd sizes here as they do in other countries. People with special interests in the genre have been arguing for 35 years weather black metal is really a Norwegian phenomenon, or if it started in Great Britain, with Venom. I literally could not ignore the Venom album Welcome to Hell when it was released in 1981. That was the first black metal album that became a big deal, at least here in Norway, and some of my friends went bananas over it. Hard to ignore being bombared with that wall of sound on a regular basis! It is still concidered one of the great classics in the genre by the people I used to hang out with during my teenage years. I like heavy metal better, and never caught the \u201cblack bug\u201d. ",
