            "answer_text": "Every Song has a different emotion and feelings , all the feelings of song depending on song's lyrics . When you listen the song and if song's music is good then you feel the lyrics too and put yourself to relate from the lyrics . Eg - As if there is song LAMBI JUDAI . And at that time when you listen it and on that moment you are suffering from this judai then you will start to relate yourself with lyrics and feel the music . Music is all about your mood , feelings and situation when it matches your mood you will start enjoy and feel the music . Thank you !! ",
