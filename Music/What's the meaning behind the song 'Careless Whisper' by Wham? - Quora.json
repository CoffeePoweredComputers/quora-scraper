            "answer_text": "\u2018Careless Whisper\u2019 is foremost a sentimental ballad, it doesn't appear to have much meaning other than the expression of common emotions attached to infidelity: guilt, sadness, anger, regret\u2026 George Michael was himself dismissive of any personal meaning - acknowledging some sadness that his somewhat casual motivation for the song had precipitated such profound reaction from so many listeners. The narrative scenario presented in the song is a cheating partner dancing with (his) cheated upon lover for the last time. The public situation of the dance room appears to impede the ability of the cheat to properly express regret to the lover. It also perhaps precipitated the disclosure of the cheating in the first place - the titular \u2018careless whisper\u2019 overheard by the lover. As the song progresses the cheat vacillates between various emotions, certainty and uncertainty, but resolves through the chorus that after this dance there will be no more - since (he) will be alone. The cleverness of the song is that the events in the ballad reflect the act of dancing to a romantic ballad, playing at the end of some social gathering of \u2018friends\u2019; precisely the kind of event we might be hearing this song! It appears to us the ballad is actually narrating a break up - in real time, as it is happening and perhaps as we are listening the ballad. A lengthy personal drama, unravelling due to a public event, in the space of moments\u2026 maybe that couple spiralling slowly next to us on the dance floor. ",

            "answer_text": "The song, Careless Whisper, is about man who is madly in love with, presumably, a woman. With a little research, I found that the singer has cheated on this woman. He feels immense guilt, which you can see in the chorus: I\u2019m never gonna dance again, guilty feet have no rhythm Though it\u2019s easy to pretend, I know you\u2019re not a fool I should have known better than to cheat a friend And waste a chance that I\u2019ve been given So I\u2019m never gonna dance again, the way I danced with you He can never dance again, remembering his betrayal to this woman.
