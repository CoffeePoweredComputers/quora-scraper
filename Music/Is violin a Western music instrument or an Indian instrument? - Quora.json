            "answer_text": "There are two conflicting claims to the root of the violin family. The subcontinent\u2019s claim is the ravanahatha, an instrument dating back to the earliest Hindu legends, with anthropological evidence supporting its use back to at least 5000BCE. However, there is evidence that the concept is much older; families of stringed instruments too similar to be coincidental but with little or no transplantation in recorded history exist in impossibly distant corners of the Eurasian continent, suggesting the development of bowed strings may have predated the rise of agricultural civilization itself, instead being carried by nomadic tribes as they spread from the Fertile Crescent out into the Subcontinent and Central Asia. Some scholars believe that these primitive bowed strings were developed into designs somewhat more reminiscent of the modern violin by Mongol horsemen, who then spread their development back across to the West in the early \u201cCommon Era\u201d centuries of Mongol conquest.

            "answer_text": "The violin is a bowed-string instrument. Other such instruments are: Viola, Cello, Double-bass  All of these have been used together in ensembles and orchestras for many centuries. Each region had its own set of instruments, and some of these instruments may have had strings that were bowed. Sarangi is an Indian version of a bowed string instrument. The violin was most likely adopted by Indian musicians who wanted to explore western variants of bowed string instruments. Which is why, the violin is positioned differently in Indian classical music than the western counterpart.  I have recently seen a trend in saxophone being played instead of the Nadaswaram/Shehnai at wedding receptions. Someday it may be a very common instrument within Indian classical music. Who knows! ",
