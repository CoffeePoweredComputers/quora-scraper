            "answer_text": "I just tested this now. I have a computer at work that doesn\u2019t have a webcam. I have been working from home for the past 8 weeks, but with some staff returning to the office, I need to be able to work with them. This means I will be working sometimes from home and sometimes from the office, but many staff will still work from home, and many business contacts still aren\u2019t comfortable meeting in person. I dont want to take my webcam to work with me each day, so I need a solution that allows me to connect to a zoom (or MS Teams) meeting from my computer (to be able to share content, present and administer large and complex meetings) and from my phone (to be able to videoconference). I just tested it and it very well for Zoom. I can moderate a large meeting using the tools on my computer to admit people to the meeting, mute people who cant mute themselves and share content from my PC. All while presenting my video and audio through my phone. I was logged in to the meeting using the same account. I imagine that this uses a bit of extra internet bandwidth, but thats not an issue for me. I am so thankful that this functionality exists so that we dont need to buy a webcam for every computer in our office - we all have phones with decent cameras so this will allow us to all continue working in a hybrid home-office team model until we are all safe to return to full-time office work (assuming that this will ever happen!!) Note, this functionality also works for Microsoft Teams, though it seems you need to join the meeting first from your phone to ensure that the video works. ",

I know you asked \u201cjoin\u201d meeting, but I thought these might be interesting to note too: If you are hosting the meeting: one device will be host, the other device will be co-host. Although zoom says this \u201cIf you sign into an additional device while logged into another device of the same type, you will be logged out automatically on the first device\u201d, interestingly to note based on what I have tried with zoom so far: if you are hosting an ongoing meeting on computer A + you can login to the same acct on computer B = you will be logged out on computer A. But ongoing meeting will not be affected, you will still be in the meeting on Com A & your participants won\u2019t even notice anything diff. You can in fact use Com B to join the same meeting, by clicking \u201cstart\u201d and you will enter the meeting as co-host on Com B. That said, still one meeting per account at any one time. ",

If you sign into an additional device while logged into another device of the same type, you will be logged out automatically on the first device. Zoom does not permit sharing accounts with multiple individuals per our Terms of ServiceIf zoom does not permit to login from more then one device then how can you join, simple you don't need to login to join a call. You will be like two different participants in the call. Hope that answered your question. Thanks for Reading. Keep Smiling \ud83d\ude42 . ",
