            "answer_text": "All 4 wrote songs, but the majority of charting tracks on the albums were penned by Freddie and Brian. On the earlier albums you could generally tell a Roger Taylor song by the fact he usually sang on them. Freddie songs were generally more extravagant with touches of opera and anthem like. Brian wrote more of the heavier stuff and Deacon liked to funk it up a little, having his most success with Another one bites the dust. The band credited all 4 members equally with songwriting from A kind of magic onward. ",
