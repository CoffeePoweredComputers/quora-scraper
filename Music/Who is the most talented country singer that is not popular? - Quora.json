His popularity was more between 2006 - 2014 or so , but he\u2019s made some amazing music since then! 2017 \u2018s Deep South is an amazing album and he released three songs from it, should of been more! HomeTown Girl was number one in late 2016, I saw him in concert for the first time in late 2017, and again in early 2019, I got front row tickets from my son for Christmas! He has an amazing baritone voice, is married and very Christian . He\u2019s rarely nominated, and don\u2019t see him much at country award shows! He has an amazing voice, and very handsome!
