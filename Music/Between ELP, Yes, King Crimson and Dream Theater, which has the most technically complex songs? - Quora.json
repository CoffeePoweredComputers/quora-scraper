            "answer_text": "First, I would need to define what I mean by \u201ctechnically complex.\u201d For me, this would involve the complexity of the compositions, regardless of how difficult they might be to play. Dream Theater\u2019s music might be the hardest to play, but their compositions are less complex than the other bands in this list. ELP\u2019s music is somewhat complex compositionally, but mostly sticks to extended song structures and classical forms, without getting into anything that is conceptually very far outside the norm. Yes has quite a few pieces that utilize sophisticated compositional techniques in interesting ways. Check out this analysis of \u201cClose to the Edge\u201d\u2026 http://www.lipscomb.umn.edu/rock/docs/Covach1997_Yes.pdf But I\u2019d say King Crimson\u2019s music is, from a compositional standpoint, on a different level than these other bands. They have ventured into some very esoteric territory, layering rhythmic patterns in unusual ways, using scales that range outside standard major and minor, and using improvisation as a tool for building sounds. Certainly it\u2019s true that not every Crimson tune is super complex as a composition, but considering the whole of their work, they\u2019ve touched on more variety than any other well-known band. Moving outside this list, there are many lesser-known groups with very sophisticated compositions. Gentle Giant has been mentioned in a few other answers, and there are several Italian bands in addition to PFM that qualify (Balletto di Bronzo, Banco, Locanda delle Fate, etc). Van der Graaf Generator and Magma are worth mentioning. There are also several Canterbury bands of note: Hatfield & the North, National Health, Egg. RIO bands are especially known for their compositions: Univers Zero, Present, Henry Cow, and so on. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is ELP. Although I`d like to add some lines. First, we must bear in mind that not all that is technically complex is good to listen ( Rachmaninoff is complex but I hate his music). I suggest another list - ELP + King Crimson + Yes + Gentle Giant + Premiatta Forneria Marconi. ELP, King Crimson, Yes and Dream Theater do not need any explanation because everybody knows their sound but Gentle Giant - it was one of the greatest bands from 1970 to 1980, well I`m not sure about the final year, but anyway, they were known for the complexity and sophistication of their music and for the varied musical skills of the members. GG was an English band that made a voyage to the bottom of what we could define as unique kind (classical, folk, jazz, soul, baroque, medieval and modernist chamber music elements). PFM was an Italian progressive rock band and they were also among the first to combine symphonic classical and traditional Italian folk influences in a rock music context. The band was created in 1967 and reached the top charts on the '70s. I think they are active but not with the original lineup. Google this if you don`t mind because I`m not sure of it. The DreamTheater is also complex but I do not think they are on the same level of complexity we are talking about. Then, we could include in this list the Mahavishnu Orchestra, an American jazz fusion band. They are also good at complexity. Greetings. ",

            "answer_text": "Luiz Braga Neto has a great answer below. I think it\u2019s a good question, but a hard one to answer. Does having classical influences \u2014 or a classically trained musisian/musicians (usually keyboardist) \u2014 make for \u2018technically complex\u2019 songs? Maybe it does, but sometimes it\u2019s just copying (see: ELP, they didn\u2019t hide it of course, and had no copyright issues with it because the composers were long-dead). I thought Rick Wakeman\u2019s playing was very technically complex \u2014 and he didn\u2019t copy pieces he leared as a pianist, not that I could tell \u2014 so Yes would get my vote from the bands you mention.
