            "answer_text": "Why not? It is a bonus if you can play guitar and sing at the same time, and not many people can do that. There are several examples of excellent singers who are also great or decent electric guitar players:  Jeff Buckley (Magnificent singer with a unique, ethereal voice, but unfortunately a very underrated guitar player) Matt Bellamy (Possesses a wide vocal range and can play multiple instruments, and is a great guitar player who plays and sings for Muse) John Mayer (Decent pop singer who possesses great songwriting capabilities on the guitar)Stevie Ray Vaughan (One of the greatest blues guitar players of all-time, but his voice is also his main instrument, and it does not sound shabby at all) George Harrison (The underrated Beatle is a good guitar player who is also a magnificent singer-songwriter, especially in his latter years with the band and his early solo career) Paul Simon (His harmonies with Art Garfunkel are some of the tightest harmonies ever heard in pop music, and at the same time he is also a very good folk guitar player)",

            "answer_text": "I can take it one step further. You can play electric guitar, sing, and play drums at the same time.  It might even be more comfortable because people would be more impressed with the multitasking if you aren't a very good singer or guitar player.  All you need is a kick drum, a hi-hat, a tambourine and maybe a snare. Keep time with the hi-hat and use the kick as an accent. Ty Segall used to do this. His album \"Lemons\" was made so he could play live.\"It #1\" - Ty Segall   Or you could get fancy like this guy. (Skip to ~7:45)  ",
