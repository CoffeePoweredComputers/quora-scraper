            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A! I've only been following Eurovision since 2009, so I'm going to focus on the period since then. I think if you looked back much farther, it would be more difficult to say which winners were unexpected because the songs weren't available online before the contest. Norway 2009 and Sweden 2012 were obvious winners. Denmark 2013, Sweden 2015, Israel 2018, and The Netherlands 2019 were all slight favorites going in to the contest. Germany 2010 and Portugal 2017 were essentially co-favorites with Azerbaijan 2010 and Bulgaria 2017, respectively. Austria 2014 is an interesting case. Before the rehearsals, people were saying she wouldn't even qualify, or if she did she'd do poorly in the final. But when they saw her performance, she became the clear favorite. Ukraine 2016 was definitely unexpected. She was, I believe, in the 6-7 range in the odds before the contest. Even right before the final, Russia was the clear favorite. Azerbaijan 2011 was totally out of left field. Granted, pre-final odds had them as tied for third with the UK behind France and Ireland. However, they were also very close to Denmark, Estonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Sweden. I think when France fell flat, there was a vacuum created, and Azerbaijan stood out the most among the possibilities to take advantage. In summary, during the period I examined, Azerbaijan 2011 and Ukraine 2016 were the most unexpected winners, and I would give Azerbaijan 2011 a slight edge among those two. ",
