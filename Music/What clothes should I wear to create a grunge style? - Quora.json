            "answer_text": "Originating from the grunge music genre and subculture which emerged in mid-1980s Seattle, and had become wildly popular during early 1990s, grunge fashion is well known for its unique style- often worn in loose-fitting clothing with an androgynous manner. Now, this fashion trend just keeps coming back over the past few years. Since the grunge trend has its own tactics of attracting attention, you may eager to learn how to look glamorous without looking like a street beggar at the same time. Keep scrolling to find your ultimate items for a grunge wardrobe and shop the similar items now.  Quite often, the plaid shirts, baggy ripped jeans, oversized tops, clunky shoes are just as much as ever to create a laid-back, comfort detail, also a heavy layering and a sloppy appearance. But nowadays, grunge fashion has undergone a number of changes. For example, with maintaining the original essence, designers try to add some chiffon and organza elements, making them look more feminine, modern, luxurious and translate it into a vintage and sophisticated vibe.  If you want to make your daily wardrobe totally different, grunge fashion is a cool style to adopt. Here are some style notes for you: 1. Denim in all its forms has become a must in the grunge fashion as usual. This can be denim jackets, denim shirts, denim shorts or jeans, perfectly with distressed, worn-out, low-rise or dark details.   Shop the Similar Items on Morimiss 2. Plaid shirts with flannel is an easy way to create a classic grunge look. You can also wear your shirt as a tunic and pair it with leggings, shorts or low-rise ripped jeans, along with chokers, hoop earrings or sunglasses to update your look.  3. Leather outfits have already become a good investment all around, meaning the leather jackets, leather dress, leather skirts or leather pants are included. An oversized leather jacket is worn with ripped jeans or goes with plus size maxi dresses truly making a grunge outfit.  4. Another must for the grunge wardrobe is the baggy casual jumpsuits, these fashion outfits will always be your street-like choices and will instantly make you look grunge.   They are On Sale on Morimiss 5. Opt for the clunky shoes! As it mentions in Wikipedia, combat boots and Doc Martens are necessary all the time for a totally chic grunge.  6. Complete your look with some statement accessories, such as chokers, studs, metallic earrings or chains. Plus, sunglasses and headscarves will be a good addition. Remember to minimize your look, don't put all the things together to make it look overwhelming.  7. Essential grunge loves darkness, so please give priority to any dark-colored outfits first. Modern grunge allows dressing with gray or other neutral colors, but black will be the best choice.  8. Layering is the essence of grunge style. With the tank top, cropped top underneath, you can layer it with a sloppy cardigan, leather biker jacket or jumper dress that is featuring in floral prints, plaids, or patterns to make a stunning and indelible grunge look.  In fact, as early as 2013, Yves Saint Laurent and Dries Van Noten were trying to bring grunge back to the runway and made it a trend again. Designers make these collections more a ready-to-wear. I believe, with the development and improvement of grunge fashion, more and more people will accept this unique oversized silhouette.

            "answer_text": "Google \u201cNirvana\u201d or \u201cKurt Cobain\u201d. That is grunge. It is about being the 'teased kid' with a little \u201cf*** you scumbag, I will top my battered late 70\u2019s early 80\u2019s thrift store clothes with an awesome pair of shades and some combat boots, dirty Chuck's or doc martens. Girls had the streak of a different color, dull colored plaid skirts. Check out Mazzy Star\u2019s video to \u201cfade in to you\u201d. And videos of \u201cHole\u201d, Smashing Pumpkins, Empire baby doll dresses with fishnets and doc martens, velvet chokers. Fiona Apple was a bit more Heroin Chic, but shows the huge influence the 70s had on 90\u2019s attire. \u201cMy So Called Life\u201d will give you more of an idea too. Grunge was really the \u201cpoor kid\u201d verging on homeless. The one that couldn't get the new clothes. The one that had to wear the dull, faded, threadbare colors of clothing washed too many times, the ripped jeans and what we now call \u201cvintage\u201d styles. It was about taking that poverty and saying \u201cF you. I do what I want. I don't want to be a slave to consumerism, I will buy my shit used or steal it.\u201d It is coming out of the style in the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s of having to have the certain designer clothes. Items that were huge: Flannel ShirtsRipped jeansDoc MartensBirkenstocksBaby doll dressesStraight leg jeansPlaid skirtsCrop topsFishnets, lace and black fishnetsManic panic hair dyeChokersBright red, brown or black lipstick. Off color too: midnight blue, dark green, burgundy etc.Velvet clothing (jackets, skirts, babydoll dresses, pants)Crop pants with no pockets. There was a zipper up the back and a seam in the front, straight leg. They were a little stretchy and came in many patterns (the 90s version of leggings, but they were thick)Think faded jeans, faded flannel mixed with dark, gemstone hues, urban decay (in a literal sense. The poverty in inner cities was a big focus)https://www.google.com/search?client=ms-android-google&biw=412&bih=322&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=SeK_WcG3Cejf0gK3l5aoCw&q=90s+grunge+patterns&oq=90s+grunge+patterns&gs_l=mobile-gws-img.3...19900.21678.0.22485.8.8.0.0.0.0.198.812.3j4.7.0....0...1.1j4.64.mobile-gws-img..1.4.574...0j35i39k1j0i7i30k1j30i10k1.160.PVWVzzLIghU#imgdii=_B7kPTTYyAHl-M:&imgrc=c7q4rqGWTUsmyM: https://www.google.com/search?client=ms-android-google&biw=412&bih=322&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=SeK_WcG3Cejf0gK3l5aoCw&q=90s+grunge+patterns&oq=90s+grunge+patterns&gs_l=mobile-gws-img.3...19900.21678.0.22485.8.8.0.0.0.0.198.812.3j4.7.0....0...1.1j4.64.mobile-gws-img..1.4.574...0j35i39k1j0i7i30k1j30i10k1.160.PVWVzzLIghU#imgrc=SOUb0ZQ55R0jEM: Redirect Notice Redirect Notice Redirect Notice Redirect Notice Redirect Notice Redirect Notice Redirect Notice Redirect Notice Redirect Notice ",
