            "answer_text": "The poster claims there is \u201cno documentation\u201d to substantiate the claims of The Solomonic Dynasty's lineage. Wrong. There's no european documentation of an event that happened over 3000 years ago and 1000s of miles away from Europe. A literal ENTIRE BOOK has been written detailing how the Dynasty was established and how The Ark of the Covenant came to reside in Ethiopia. Its called The Kebra Negast (Book of Kings) and has been considered a Holy Text by the Tewahedo Church of Orthodox Christianity which outdates Romes conversion by a few 100 years via St Timothy witnessing the Gospel of Christ to The Ethiopian who was a highly respected merchant and source of news from abroad to the King & Queen who eagerly adopted the new form of Judaism after centuries of adherence to Jewish law & cannon, observation and practice. The Gospel flourished in Ethiopia where it was preserved as intended by it's Founder, unmolested by european agendas of white supremacy and excuses for slavery that it was wielded as against poor American black people and ppl of dark skin the world over.

            "answer_text": "From 1270 to 1974, Ethiopia was ruled by a family claiming (with no documentation) to be descendants of the Biblical King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, making them relatives of Jesus Christ. The Hebrew Bible does refer to the Queen of Sheba visiting King Solomon in Jerusalem bearing gifts (and this gets connected to the gifts of the Magi in legend). Allegedly she had a son, Menelik, with Solomon, and took him home with her; later he returned to Israel to meet his father. Haile Selassie was a descendant of this alleged line through his paternal grandmother, Tenagnework Sahle Selassie. There was a line of male descendants, but they were pushed aside in a family feud.
