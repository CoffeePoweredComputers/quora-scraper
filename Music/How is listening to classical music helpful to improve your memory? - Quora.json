            "answer_text": "Not per se, if you\u2019re talking about studying. If you like the music, if it calms you down, and it does not draw your attention, it can help you concentrate. The genre doesn\u2019t matter: it\u2019s whatever works for you. (Personally, I prefer listening to brown noise when I have to concentrate, because music draws my attention.) As for memory, it has been shown that if we encode memories while being in one state (e.g. underwater), it\u2019s easier to recall those memories when in that same state (e.g. underwater). State-dependent memory - Wikipedia This suggests that if you study while listening to classical music, you should do a bit better on the test if you write it while listening to classical music. However, sadly, such an activity would likely not be permitted in the exam room. No headphones or devices, ya know.

But \u2026 if you\u2019re talking about dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s, \u2026 familiar music may facilitate attention, reward and motivation, which in turn makes it more possible to manage emotional distress in Alzheimer\u2019s.
