            "answer_text": "Paul used a 1962 Epiphone Casino, a guitar that was crafted in Kalamazoo, MI in the Gibson guitar factory. I read that that Paul was inspired by Jimi Hendrix and how he used feedback; so he searched for a guitar that would easily feedback. With the Casino being a hollow body electric guitar, it reportedly achieved what he was looking for when he purchased it in late 1964. Paul\u2019s Casino came with a Bigsby vibrato. George and John also each bought Epiphone Casinos soon after Paul. But their\u2019s came with a different head stock (hour glass shape) than Paul\u2019s (Gibson-style \u201copen book\u201d headstock). But George\u2019s Casino also came with a Bigsby vibrato. (John\u2019s came instead with a trapeze bridge.) One of his fave guitars, Paul played his Casino not only for the \u201cTaxman\u201d solo, but also for the \u201cPaperback Rider\u201d riff. All the Best! ",
