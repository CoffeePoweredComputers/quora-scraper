            "answer_text": "Can we PLEASE stop with this? There is no group that's better than another. All kpop idols worked their asses off in order to get to where there are now. People are obviously going to have different preferences. If someone loves cute concepts, they might personally think Twice is the best group. If someone loves girl crush concepts, they might personally think Blackpink is the best group. You can't define one group as better than another, because people will always have different opinions. So, please, can we stop with questions like these: \u201cIs EXO better than BTS?\u201d \u201cWhy is Mamamoo so much better than Blackpink?\u201d \u201cHow is Twice so famous, even though other groups are a billion times better than them?\u201d Sure, you might think Twice is better than Blackpink. I personally don't think so, even though I still absolutely love Twice. Stop starting fan wars. Stop asking these questions. Thank you. ",
