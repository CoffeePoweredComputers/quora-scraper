            "answer_text": " I agree somewhat with the other answer that suggests you have to consider it a long term, pre-adulthood interaction but there are ways. One, you\u2019re going to have to abandon your lower-middle-class family/roots. They can\u2019t come with you. They are like a form of cancer. They carry values, mores, mindsets that are counter-productive to social mobility. This is the main reason why you most people don\u2019t move. The current statistic is about 18% move from Poverty to Middle Class. From Middle Class to Upper Class (Rich) is about 30%. Two, you have to understand the definitional boundaries of that where you seek to move from and then to. Like any journey you\u2019ll have to be specific is what your steps and landmarks look like. Poverty is earning under $18k-30k for a single person/family of 4. The Middle class is $30k to $250k earned annually for an individual/family of 4. Upper Middle Class starts at $250k to $1 but again, that\u2019s continuously yearly sustained income. Upper Class is, therefore, the previous and the next two: Rich which is earning $1 million or more a year continuously. Wealthy is earning $10 million a year or more.  Financial Social class related to socioeconomics collapses to 3 levels Poor, Middle Class and Rich/Wealthy but you can see how they are broken down within the broad 3 levels. You can achieve Upper Middle Classhood working a MC job as a two-person household saving into a reasonable pension/401k and purchasing a home that has 20\u201340 years to accrue in value. You and a partner will have to have jobs that start at a decent level of $36k+ and increase over time. You\u2019ll have to be thoughtful about having children. Children cost approximately $10k to $25k a year until 18 and then there are potential college costs\u2014-each child can cost as much as $500k for 1\u201325 years. They too are an investment because you\u2019re trying to get them to a higher level than you by having a greater push-off in life. Children are an emotional asset but a financial liability. They become stressful when there hasn\u2019t been thought and planning about them before, way before they\u2019re present. They are essentially people you must legally support for 18 years..because they\u2019re related to you. The thoughtfulness comes in regarding how many children you have. Note this: poor people exacerbate and trap themselves into Poverty by having children they cannot afford. Each child has to be looked at as a yearly $25k BILL DUE. Which is why the Middle-Class paradigm is structured around 2 children, you need more resources per child. And now you see why you have to edit your lower-class origins/family into your life, because they, thinking against or being ignorant of the conscious realization of children as a financial expense, will encourage MORE children for a variety of reasons that are counter to financial planning and progress. Where you live also builds into your gross and net worth. You\u2019ll have to consider the type of work you do and the type of money you\u2019re looking to generate. There are at least 10\u201315 cities in America that are increasing in their financial capacity, safety, personal luxuries, and new industry. Slow Track. If you\u2019re looking to start a career, then you have to consider law (law enforcement), healthcare, technology/IT are the areas of future growth always in society at normal rates.Medium Track. Real estate, finance and financial management/estate management of wealth people are medium track. These jobs aggregate the needs of society but can take longer to manifest.Fast Track is entrepreneurship, investing, high-risk jobs, extensive travel jobs, jobs that require knowledge of multiple languages/cultures. These jobs also include Medium Track but somehow infuse risk and speed to them.You and a partner that you have now or in the future\u2014-will have to be on the same page about money, work, owning a business, investing, long term goals. Everyone wants \u201cit\u201d but doesn\u2019t understand it\u2019s a 10\u201325-year endeavor financially.  Socially/Politically You will have to move into circles that include both politicians, business owners, and professional people. Which means you\u2019ll also need mentors. The first level of mentors you'll find will have been on a school-university level and you\u2019ll have to maintain and nurture those relationships. Class movement is dependent upon relationships because you\u2019ll be introduced to higher and higher levels. You\u2019ll have to become a climber, perhaps even before you have money. Which will mean you\u2019ll have to acquire skills and knowledge of the Upper Class around art, real estate, provenance, manners, etiquette classes/training, a legacy so that you know what they\u2019re saying around you and what you\u2019re trying to achieve., Join school boards, community boards, library and university boards. Travel As soon as you can, even if you don\u2019t have money, travel to different places in the world. Being Upper Class is not just monetary it\u2019s also mentality and world view. Clothing Classic, well made, tailored. You can dress the part with a gradual purchasing of classic, good clothing that fits you well and isn\u2019t ostentatious. Therapy You will need a Life Coach and a psychologist to both motivate you and help you emotionally deal with ultimately changing and leaving people behind. The redesign of yourself will be grueling but it\u2019s entirely possible with help. Tastes Your tastes in music, art, entertainment will not have to so much change as expand. The opera, musical concerts of classical music, knowing classical music, art galleries will become things you\u2019ll have to attend and understand. Networking For men, it\u2019s generally golf, for women it generally involves charitable works. You will also have to learn to attend the right kinds of sporting events aside from football and baseball. This will include professional mixers, conferences, wealth seminars. Climbers show up at these places and make themselves useful in the environment. Education If you have to educate at a state level, extension course at an Ivy League college or do a Masters. I tell my students at Columbia, 50% of the reason why parents send their children there is for the education\u2014-the other 50% is to mate with/be available to the other kinds of \u201cright\u201d children. You\u2019ll have to think of this for yourself and for a mate and for your children. Romeo and Juliet's bullshit goes out the window when you\u2019re considering if it\u2019s not just a good match but also a beneficial one to the family and the future. This means perhaps even gently molding your children to as my mother always admonished me: \u201cFuck up, never fuck down.\u201d Royalty/Ancestral Heritage You can buy a title and to move through upper society you might consider it. But you would definitely have to know your family's origins. Race, Gender, Sexuality, Transsexuality It\u2019s possible and being White makes it easier but it\u2019s possible for all races, though if you\u2019re not White, you have to open your romantic interests racially and age-wise. The same goes for young women and gay men and women. I would think that the hardest it would be possible to move would be a trans person unless they were born into wealth (Chaz Bono) or had a great financial, social, etc achievement prior to transitioning (Caitlyn Jenner). It\u2019s difficult and you have to answer what the \u201clevel:\u201d is you\u2019re trying to achieve because it\u2019s clear but amorphous depending upon where you are in the US or abroad. The greatest difficulty, slightly riding along with the other answer, is learning, absorbing so much \u201cdifference\u201d compared to where you started. It\u2019s easier to shift classes, to be accepted if you move in circles like country clubs, concerts, art, manners/etiquette\u2014-like I did as a child form my parents and grandparents\u2014-but it, the mindset, can be learned. You would do best to study social class first because there are Hidden Rules to class and class movement and classes. If you don\u2019t know them then you don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re doing right, wrong or counterproductively. Yes, balling this all together with the above studying and movements and socialization, you\u2019ll have to understand class societies too. But I can tell you from personal experience it\u2019s fun, worth it and something you can choose to have as much as you like and then back off. You also will discover a different experience of life or a mandate of personal development because you\u2019ll begin to understand how Poverty isn\u2019t about simply money and resources, it\u2019s about limiting human potential and development. Hopefully, the social class movement will then make you want to turn around and help others upgrade and move because you\u2019ll explicitly know what\u2019s required. That\u2019s some of what I try to do with my students in all of the classes, programs, universities\u2014-it\u2019s really the biggest obstacle to class movement\u2014-lack of awareness about class structures and obstacles themselves. #KylePhoenix #TheKylePhoenixShow ",

No habitual drains on my check and no needless spending took me from the bottom 20% to the top 20%. You will not get there any other way\u2026 Even with a wealthy start, you are more likely to lose it than to keep or grow it. 80% of all millionaires and billionaires are first generation with over 20% of them immigrants where English is not even their first language.

After all, it is a \u201cgrade curve\u201d that we all find ourselves on and if you are better at this game and play it harder than others you will have more.
