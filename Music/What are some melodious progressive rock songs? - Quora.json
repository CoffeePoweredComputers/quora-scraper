            "answer_text": "1. King Crimson - \u201cLizard\u201d; It is sort of a jazzy, medieval epic featuring Jon Anderson of Yes in his best contribution. 2. Robert Wyatt - \u201cSea Song\u201d; this song sounds literally aquatic and sad, and features probably my favourite vocal performance in popular music. Not strictly proggy prog. 3. Wishbone Ash - \u201cSometime World\u201d; fantastic melodic dual guitar attack...Iron Maiden stole a couple of guitar breaks from the album (Argus) featuring this. 4. Kevin Ayers - \u201cLady Rachel,\u201d \u201cShouting in a Bucket Blues,\u201d \u201cOh, Wot a Dream!\u201d; Kevin Ayers is a favourite whimsical songwriter of mine who was with Soft Machine (that also featured Robert Wyatt) in their first album. \u201cShouting in a Bucket Blues\u201d features outstanding melodic guitar playing from Steve Hillage and \u201cOh, Wot a Dream!\u201d is allegedly about Syd Barrett. 5. Jethro Tull - \u201cThick as a Brick\u201d; a famous no-brainer epic. 6. Premiata Forneria Marconi (PFM) - \u201cAppena Un Po\u201d; lovely Italian progressive rock 7. Matching Mole - \u201cO Caroline\u201d; a lovely ballad from a definitive Canterbury style band featuring Robert Wyatt and Dave Sinclair (also of Caravan; see below) 8. Caravan - \u201cNine Feet Underground\u201d; another definitive Canterbury style band, but this is an epic...and very English too. 9. Gentle Giant - \u201cThe Advent of Panurge\u201d; this is a lovely, unique band playing in a medieval style and thematically matching Rabelais\u2019 Gargantua and Pantagruel to quite some extent. Note: I am not a fan of Yes, Genesis, ELP, Kansas, Rush and the like, and not a fan of symphonic prog at all. However, as a collector, I have enjoyed wacky and whimsical obscurities of the progressive rock/krautrock/space rock genre a lot. ",
