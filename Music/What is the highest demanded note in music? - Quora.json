            "answer_text": "Both the piccolo and the piano have a highest usable note of the C that is four octaves above middle C, but the pipe organ has the greatest range with the highest note being an entire octave above that. Any higher than that (or even at that pitch) things are dicey because of the frequency; many people can\u2019t hear that high, and it\u2019s dreadfully difficult to keep in tune. You might find this chart helpful.  ",
