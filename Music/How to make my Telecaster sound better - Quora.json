            "answer_text": "True story\u2026 Back in the early 1980s, I was in a guitar store and played an 1965 Telecaster custom, the bound body and rosewood fret board version. It sounded awful. The guitar played wonderfully, but I hated the sound of it. So, I thought the guitar wasn\u2019t worth the 500 bucks and walked away. Now, a few years later I was touring and a guy came back stage and asked if I would mind playing his guitars on stage so he could hear what they really sounded like in the hands of a professional. I said no problem. He produced an Ibanez JS100 and\u2026.a Telecaster from around the early 1980s. Well, a deal is a deal. That night, I put on the JS 100 for a couple rockers, and it sounded pretty good. Later, when a blues tune came up, I decided that would do for the Tele, as they are a good blues guitar. I strapped it on and we kicked off the song and\u2026 \u2026it sounded great. It sang and snarled and was perfect. Later, I sat down and tried to understand why just a few years earlier the Tele I had played in the store sounded so bad, but this Tele sounded great. A Tele is a Tele, even with 20 years between them. They hadn\u2019t changed hardly at all, even with CBS in control. So, what had changed? Me. I love that a Telecaster is an honest guitar. It tells you how good or bad your technique is, right away. If you\u2019ve only been playing a little while, you will likely not sound good on a Telecaster. That\u2019s okay. It\u2019s just telling you the truth. Now, that said\u2026 Assuming you are playing a Tele with zero issues, and your technique is good enough, we have to wonder about other parts of the signal chain. Pedals? Remove them all. Go straight into the amp from the guitar. Still bad? Then either the amp sucks, because it\u2019s a cheap piece of garbage\u2026 \u2026or you haven\u2019t spent time dialing in your sound - not your tone, which comes from your fingers. So, assuming you have a decent amp, you need to spend time with your amp dialing in the treble, mid and bass to achieve decent starting place for your sound. Then, add pedals in one at a time to see how they affect the sound when bypassed, and then engaged. Remove that pedal and put another pedal in the chain, and only that pedal. And so on for each pedal. This way you can hear which pedal is changing your sound. True bypass claims to not interfere with the signal from the guitar to the amp when the pedal is not \u201con\u201d. Non true bypass pedals, the signal runs through the pedal\u2019s circuitry, minus the effect, and very much can affect the sound that reaches the amp. So you have a little work to do, either on your technique, your amp, or both\u2026before dealing with the pedals. Good luck. (I teach guitar via Skype/Zoom; reasonable rates. PM for details.) ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s an old saying in performance car circles: \u201cthe best upgrade you can make is to the nut that holds the steering wheel,\u201d which is a pun meaning \u201cupgrade the driver.\u201d To some degree, the same holds for guitars, and it is often said that Hendrix or Page or SRV or Eric Johnson or BB King or whoever would still sound like themselves on just about any guitar \u2014 it\u2019s not the guitar but the hands that are primarily responsible for the tone. That said, how to make your Tele sound better depends entirely on what it\u2019s current shortcomings are (which you haven\u2019t provided any information about). Do you not like the amplified tone? Consider upgrading the pickups (the most common upgrade for sound) and possibly, pots and capacitor. Is the bridge of decent quality? Are your strings old? Does it suffer from fret buzz? Get a proper setup, possibly including fret dressing, and have the nut checked. Does it not stay in tune? Make sure you are putting your strings on correctly, check the nut for binding/friction, and consider installing better tuners. If it\u2019s fundamentally a decent guitar, it can be worth investing in improvements. Some guitars might not be worth (poor quality wood and/or construction, frets not spaced correctly on the fingerboard, poor quality for all parts). If you don\u2019t know and don\u2019t have a strong stomach feel about it, get the opinion of a luthier / repair tech or an experienced player. ",
