            "answer_text": "Yep, most Kpop (if not all) groups, even those from the Big 3, tend to live in the same dorm after debut for awhile. This also makes it easier for group schedules and things (especially during the first few years of debut where the group is trying hard to gain recognition and a name in the Kpop industry) as all the members in the group would be living in the same space and can just easily wake each other up and go. (Most groups\u2019 managers also sometimes tends to live in the same dorm, or otherwise somewhere really close to the dorm for better supevision) I guess it can also be seen as a sort of \u201cbonding\u201d thing as sometimes when groups are formed, the members don\u2019t know each other that much or weren\u2019t that close during trainee days and in order to work as a team\u2026 well you gotta have teamwork and an understanding with your teammates right? However, if the group/each member has earned enough money, they can choose if they want to move out into their own apartments/houses (The company usually pays for most of the dorm accomodations like bills and stuff, so if an idol wants to move out it has to be of their own pocket money). For example, Got7 used to live together in a dorm but now all of them are living separately either together with another family member or they bought their own apartments (I think Jinyoung is the only one who\u2019s staying in the old dorm though). People move out for various reasons and it isn\u2019t always because the idols aren\u2019t close to each other or dislike each other, sometimes it\u2019s better to just have your own privacy. On the other hand, BTS which we all know obviously have a lot of money, still decides to live together in one of the more secure and richest apartment housing because of reasons maybe like security or something along that line. (But I think most of the BTS members currently also bought their own apartments, probably after the group decides to disband or if they want their own private time or etc. etc there\u2019s many reasons) ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, most idol groups live in dorms with their members from the time they\u2019re preparing for debut and through their first few years. It\u2019s easier to handle the group when they\u2019re all under one roof. Rookie groups often times tend to have members ranging from teens to early 20s so often times the older members have to be there to look after the younger ones. Plus they usually have strict curfews and rules so it\u2019s easier to manage them in one place. Usually in their first few years of activity as a group, their first dorm is usually very small, cramped, with many members sharing rooms. And a manager lives with them because someone needs to keep an eye on them and often there\u2019s minors in the group. Then as they start to make money, depending on companies and how much money they have (like I\u2019m sure the big 3 have better living accommodations than a small unknown company), they would move to a better dorm with better accommodations. Like Seventeen, a group with 13 guys said their first dorm was small and had only one bathroom, then about 2 years after debut, they moved to a bigger apartment with 3 bathrooms and 3 rooms, then last year, they moved in to 2 separate apartments and for the first time, some members got their own room. As the members get older, they start moving out one their own, because after living in dorm life for probably 10 years (including trainee days), they need their own space and usually by this time. Sometimes the company would tell them to get their own place by this time. ",
