            "answer_text": "Your question has two possible meanings. If it means learning more quickly to play, the answer would lie in keeping your concentration (for music requires more concentration than almost any human activity), remembering to enjoy the music you are making, and don\u2019t set a schedule for improvement. If you get all hanktankered about learning, it will interrupt your concentration, and slow down your progress. If your question is directed at getting sheer speed into your technique, there are many ways. Music is almost all scales and chords, so learning both so thoroughly they are part of your stem-cell system will help you be ready for anything - and if you are ready, you can be fast. If you still wonder about how this or that scale goes, then you will stumble out the gate and around the corners, and your playing will be jagged and marred and not fast. You can only play as fast as you can play smoothly (meaning rhythmically even) You can play very fast if you have no doubt as to what your next note - your next measure - your next phrase is, and what fingers are going to play it. It\u2019s just like driving a car fast - if you don\u2019t know what\u2019s ahead, you are driving blind, aand you will run off the road. Hands that are not relaxed will not play evenly. Let your energy come from the big muscles in the back and legs, which control the smaller ones in the arm, on down to the fingers. No claws, no tight, stretched fingers, just relaxed\u2026 r e l a x e d. Doesn\u2019t that feel good? Enormous energy can pass through the fingers now. Let them dance, but more like puppets controlled by the big muscles than like lumberjacks stomping about on logs. All scales finger the same; practice scales that go at least two octaves. The one-octave scales you see in books are confusing and troublesome. Put your thumbs around F and C and let the sharps and flats fall where they may. A minor adjustment will have you playing D, A, and G - but the goal is to not have those finger numbers in your head - they must go to your central nervous system. \u201c2\u201d means nothing when you are furiously pounding out a Beethoven Sonata. Fingers should automatically find themselves on the right note. You will develop this ability over the years, and gain speed, until you are 95 or so, and will be playing faster than when you were 25. The others have given a lot of interesting and helpful physical technique - I thought I\u2019d give you some goals and simple ways to head towards them. ",

            "answer_text": "There would be two types of practice for that: 1) using a set piece of music to practice speed, with accuracy and feel as a guide to balancing speed with quality performance, and 2) speed skills as just physical training and eye/hand coordination at high speed. This is a great question. I\u2019m convinced that a great number of musicians don\u2019t practice the physical interaction with the instrument nearly enough, and that greatly impedes them developing as musicians, both further, and in playing the best at what music they do know. Since you mention piano, there is one series of hand and forearm exercises that help this quite a bit. In the hands and forearms you need to develop strength, fine sensitivity and endurance. So these exercises do that, and don\u2019t even require a piano: with nothing in your hands, open and close your hands as fast as possible, with maximum tension in your hands, for as long as you can. You\u2019ll likely be able to do 100, maybe 200, but after about 60 reps you\u2019ll start to feel a burn in your forearms and slow down progressively more, but keep at it until you\u2019re only doing about 1 every second. That intense burn is a full aerobic workout taken to it\u2019s max. The important part is 2 parts: go as fast as you possibly can the whole time, and make sure your hands are using maximum tension (open and closing motion muscles are both contracted at full effort against each other). When you stop, wait 5 minutes and then do it again. The second time your arms will be pumped up with more blood, the muscles will be tougher right away and you\u2019ll be slower and won\u2019t be able to do so many, but that\u2019s the training effect you want. This exercise only takes a few minutes and can be done EVERYWHERE, several times a day.using a barbell or dumbbell for two particular moves that work the hand muscles in opposite ways, to develop your ability to open and close hands/fingers powerfully and rapidly, with endurance \u2192 with a barbell, sit in a chair with your forearms on your thighs, hands facing up and with the barbell in your hands. Raise and lower the bar using your forearm muscles only, keep your hands holding the barbell. On the lower end of the motion you can unroll your fingers a little if you have the strength, then roll them up again and lift the barbell up high, rotating only at the wrist, NOT THE ELBOWS. keep the forearms on the thighs during all of this exercise. This is a great power builder and endurance builder for the forearms, because you can control the speed and the weight resistance.Standing up, using a barbell or dumbell, grab the weight with the palm of your hand facing down. Your thumb goes under the barbell to help lift it. Then raise and lower the barbell/dumbbell using mostly the power of your forearms and biceps, keeping your wrists straight, and repeatedly use a rocking motion to put all the work onto the thumb and the underside of your forearm. When doing the rocking motion up and down, only using about a 30-degree range of motion, don\u2019t go high or down all the way, you want to keep the heavy load on the forearm and thumb. This develops the muscles that pull the fingers open and up, the opposite muscles that are used in most other exercises. Be sure to apply effort to your fingers to help raise the weight, you should feel lots of effort in the tops of your hand, the tops of your arms.After doing these exercises, wait 5 minutes to cool down, and then do some stretching exercises for your hands, wrists and forearms so that adding power also adds flexibility and range of motion.NOTE: don\u2019t do this exercise within 2 hours of performance, or if so, do only a low level of effort to use it as a warmup. Doing a full effort routine can take so much power OUT of your arms for a couple hours that you\u2019d be totally useless to play the piano for that time. If you\u2019ve never done these exercises, I recommend starting them on a day when you\u2019re NOT doing a performance, so that you get a sense of how much effort and recovery time you\u2019ll need.",
