            "answer_text": "I like this question I think it\u2019s not because they don\u2019t want to I think it\u2019s because in the 2010s at the same time they where releasing new material every couple years and at the same time they where having 20 plus anniversaries of their albums from the 90s so they would perform their newer material along with performing their material from the 90s and material that came a couple years before the new album also keep in mind most of their material are relatively long. Like before the panademic they where doing the 20th anniversary of playing Metropolis pt 2 Scenes of A Memory my favorite album of all time in its entirety along with performing songs from their newest album Distance over Time so they where performing those two and focusing on more on those two albums then the other albums.

I remember seeing something odd were you could tell there was some tension between Portnoy and James I'm sure someone has an exact reason for you.I'm a big Dream Theater fan but I've gotten away from listening to them much Lately I'm a drummer and Portnoy is fun to play along to and Mangini is very challenging I prefer the early stuff and have been listening to tool more then anything lately hey Carpe Diem ",
