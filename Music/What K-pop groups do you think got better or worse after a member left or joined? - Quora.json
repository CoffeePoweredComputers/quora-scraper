            "answer_text": "I will probably get so much hate for it, but yeah, here we got. This is my personal opinion, you can say yours about my answer in the comments, but please, be respectful and don\u2019t insult me there. If you don\u2019t feel satisfied with my answer, then go ahead and write your own. PENTAGON - E\u2019Dawn left - Worse  I don\u2019t think that the group is now miserable without any potential, but the peak of their careers was the SHINE era in 2018. Now, even though Cube is doing everything they can, they are not able to bring the group to the success they had back then. Even though their latest comeback Dr. Bebe was more than a decent one, they still failed to rinse the fame from it. I think they managed to get some recognition from the general public when they participated in the Kingdom, but still, they didn\u2019t win the competition. The member who drew a lot of attention to the group was E\u2019Dawn. The company created this mysterious vibe for him, which differed from the rest of the group and because he was in the center, most of the time, he was the member in which people remembered the first when someone mentioned the name of the group. Ever since the \u201cdating scandal\u201d with Hyuna became a nasty one and they were more or less \u201ckicked out\u201d of the company, it ruined the group\u2019s image. Having scandal, which was that blown up on social media, is never a good thing for a new group and the following \u201cdating scandals\u201d of other members, definitely didn\u2019t help them either.  Many people stopped following the group and became a solo stan of Dawn as they wanted to support him and Hyuna on their solo journey. I can\u2019t confidently tell that Pentagon would be huge if E\u2019Dawn was still in it, but I believe that they would be recognized more than they are now. It is not all about E\u2019Dawn leaving, it is also about the miserable management of the company. Stray Kids - Woojin left - Better/Same  This comes the part, for which all STAYs will probably kill me alive, but I don\u2019t care. Yes, Woojin was and still is an amazing vocalist and he was the member of the group once, but now when the group is still promoting as nothing happened and their hype and success haven\u2019t changed a bit is just confirmation of my statement - the group can live without Woojin. Let\u2019s be honest here, Woojin was definitely not one of the most popular members of the group and that\u2019s the main reason, why his departure hasn\u2019t affected them as much as if Hyunjin/Felix/Jisung (who are in my opinion the members, which are loved by the fans the most) did the same thing. The group still has Seungmin as the main vocalist and Chan is definitely not horrible either. They are not in need of another vocalist, even though Woojin back then was a huge part of their vocal line.  I also think that it didn\u2019t affect the group that much because many people believe that Woojin did something wrong and was selfish towards the group as the leader Chan once mentioned in his Vlive - therefore, the fans are supporting the group and hating more on Woojin. Exo - Luhan, Tao, Kris - Better/Worse  This one is questionable. It would depend on the management of the company and if SM let them promote outside the group like they are doing now. In that case, their departure hurt the group. Imagine if they were allowed to act (mainly Kris, who acted in Hollywood and many Chinese dramas/movies and Luhan who also acted in many successful movies/dramas), have all these partnerships with Chinese labels, were sent to be mentors on a survival show. Exo would have been huge if they stayed and were allowed to build up their solo careers which would bring fame to the group. Also, it wouldn\u2019t influence the group in a bad way - the group would be almost without any scandal if you think about it.  But as I know SM, the solo activities they would let them do would be very limited, therefore I think that their departure was a good thing in some ways. Many people now can\u2019t imagine Exo as twelve. Especially many new fans, don\u2019t even know that the group had some Chinese members other than Lay. I can\u2019t really imagine how would the group work now if it was still EXO-M and EXO-K. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t confidently tell if their departure was a good or bad thing. BigBang - Seungri left - Better  This is a hard one too. Yes, no one would love to see him in the group again after we know what he has done, but the thing is that BigBang is group which is in the industry for a long time and many people can\u2019t imagine how they would look like with only four members on the stage. People are just used to seeing them as a five-member boy group, that it won\u2019t feel the same. It is a good thing that Seungri is no longer in the group as he would damage the group\u2019s image totally if he stayed in it with people knowing his crimes. Yes, the group members have been in many scandals including drugs and alcohol before, but nothing was as serious as what Seungri did.  That\u2019s why I feel that the group is better off without him now, even though it is weird. 2PM - Jay Park left - Better/Worse  Again, this one has two scenarios. Jay Park was indeed quite a popular member until the controversy with him hating on Korean culture and industry showed up. It is obvious that Korean people would be holding grudge against him if he stayed in the group because he insulted our culture, but as a Korean, I don\u2019t think that his words were that controversial. Just like in the case of Exo, we don\u2019t know if JYP let him promote as a solo artist in the same way he does now. I think he would be very limited because he can be a controversial person many times as he is not afraid of being honest and do things, which wouldn\u2019t be taken well by many people, and that\u2019s something JYP doesn\u2019t like.  I mean like - he would definitely help the group to grow and lead them well as their leader, but I think that his departure was good both for the group to keep the clean image and for him, because now, he is an artist with freedom, who is known just because no company holds him back from expressing himself. Super Junior M - Henry - Worse (this is an honorable mention)  Henry was one of the members who was discriminated against by fans for being Chinese and also because he was the member the company added after the fans begged them not to put more members to the group. If you look at how the company was promoting Henry, you will be disgusted. The thing is that Super Junior M could be a huge group and Henry could be one of the most popular artists under SM if the company treated him well. Just look at him now. This guy is a definition of talent and entertaining skills. He is an amazing actor, whenever he appears on some show, people can\u2019t stop laughing, he is without any scandal, he is a genius in playing musical instruments and he is even more than a decent singer.  Yes, he didn\u2019t fit the group and this answer should be about how it affected the group, but in Henry\u2019s case, I think SM made a huge mistake of letting him go and not promoting him enough while he was still with them. Write the groups I should talk about in the comment section. I can\u2019t think about more groups at the moment, so I will probably edit this answer in the early future and add more groups. I want to talk about Girl\u2019s Generation, but that would be a long-ass one. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m on my computer and I accidentally submitted an answer before I was even finished with writing it, so here I am to salvage a post, while trying my hand at this. Eunkyo / F-ve Dolls / Worse  Co-Ed School MBK Entertainment(then known as Core Contents Media) debuted co-ed group Co-Ed School in October 2010. A while later in January 2011 and February 2012, they would debut male and female sub-units SPEED and F-ve Dolls. At this point they were both sub-units, but soon they went on to become individual groups and Co-Ed School essentially disbanded. When the concept of a female sub-unit was brought about, the group consisted of the four members that were in Co-Ed School. While preparing for a debut, they chose to add a new member. Seo Eunkyo.  Seo Eunkyo This was essentially the worst decision MBK Entertainment could have ever made. It was known that members Soomi and Chanmi didn\u2019t get along. When Co-Ed School received a congratulatory cake with all the members faces on it for their successful debut, Chanmi went and smashed Soomi\u2019s face. Soomi chose to leave the girl group in 2012, with the intentions of becoming an actress. Apparently Chanmi and Eunkyo would relentlessly bully her. Eunkyo would even go as far as try and turn Soomi\u2019s seniors against her. This included Supernova, Black Pearl, Davichi, Gangkiz, etc. Fortunately she wasn\u2019t able to do this, as Soomi had been in the company the longest and was good friends with most of her older company-mates. What Eunkyo WOULD do, though, was talk badly about her to Gangkiz\u2019s Somin and Hyeji on Facebook. T-ARA / Hwayoung / Worse  T-ARA T-ARA debuted in 2009, under MBK Entertainment. The original line-up was composed of six members, but over the course of the coming years, more members would be added. In their first year or so, they had a few decent releases with songs such as \u2018Wanna Play\u2019 and \u2018Lies\u2019. It was only when they would release their song \u2018Bo Peep Bo Peep\u2019 that the girls would gain moderate attention. They won on numerous music shows, and were generally doing very well. In July 2010, it was announced that Ryu Hwayoung would be joining as the seventh member. This boded well for them, but only for a certain amount of time.  Ryu Hwayoung The group released some of their best performing songs, \u2018Roly-Poly\u2019, \u2018Cry Cry\u2019, \u2018We Were in Love\u2019 and \u2018Lovey Dovey\u2019 in 2011. \u2018Roly Poly\u2019 was Goan Charts\u2019 best selling single of the year. The girls even signed a deal with management company J-Rock and would begin promotions in Japan. In May and June of 2012, it was announced that there would once again be new member additions, with two more girls, Dani and Areum, set to join the seven piece. In the end, only Areum would join, with Dani remaining a trainee. About a month later, July 25th and 26th, T-ARA were holding a concert in Japan, where Hwayoung only performed one song due to a supposed leg injury. After the concert, one of the members tweeted something about determination, with four of the other members backing her up. Hwayoung and her sister, Hyoyoung, tweeted about a \u2018bad person\u2019 and this had netizens speculating on whether Hwayoung was being bullied. She would eventually leave the group after a year and eight months. It would eventually come out that Hwayoung had next to no leg injury. She was seen walking fine during the time she had an injury, and would have people help her whenever there were cameras around. It was also revealed the she went to a nearby hotel nail salon while T-ARA were holding their concert in Japan. Hwayoung and her sister would appear on the television show Taxi and try and make as if Hwayoung was the one being targeted. They played the victim, and tried to gain sympathy from many. T-ARA had many releases after this, but never really did as well as they did before Hwayoung\u2019s scandal. TRCNG / Taeseon + Wooyeop / Worse  TRCNG TRCNG are currently an eight member boy group, under TS Entertainment. They debuted in October 2017 with the title track \u2018Spectrum\u2019. On November 4th 2019, members Taeseon and Wooyeop filed a criminal complaint against their company with the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency for violating the Child Welfare Law. They stated that they were abused, assaulted and extorted of money, meaning TS Entertainment possibly threatened to commit violence or reveal private information about them in order to take money from them.  Wooyeop + Taeseon The members live in a dorm in an apartment complex. Some of the members lived in two rooms, while others lived a tiny separate room close by. Taeseon and Wooyeop revealed that the members are barely able to live in these rooms. There is hardly any space, as they have to live cramped up with their house equipment and personal belongings. The second room\u2019s ceiling is so low, you can\u2019t even stand up. Parts of the dorm had even started falling apart. The group would often have their water and electricity cut off a result of TS Entertainment not paying for their utility bills. At one point, they were promoting one of their albums, and a few of the members came down with the flu. Despite being sick, the members went out and performed on stage. They had to pay for their medical bills themselves. Their rooms would also have constant problems with lights, with their kitchen and laundry room one\u2019s breaking down. In their dorm, there were two bathrooms. Each washroom had one toilet. After a period of time, the one broke down and the boys were forced to all use one toilet. After some time, this one would go on to experience faults as well. Wooyeop\u2019s mother had to end up paying multiple times for a plumber to come and fix it. These are just some of the problems all of these boys have had to face. I think it is far better that these two boys got out of this awful situation with their company. They can now focus on their own careers, where they will probably be doing a lot better and will have better conditions to work in. The awful predicaments their company, TS Entertainment, put them through will not bode well for the remaining members. They could have been on their way to reaching probable stardom, but I personally feel that the group will never do as well as they could\u2019ve, were they not forced to live like this. Their company\u2019s awful antics have put a permanent scar on their image and I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll ever be able to be well received by the public again. These are just a few of the stories that come out of the industry. There are many more that should be recognised, acknowledged and spoken about. ",
