Well here goes\u2026 Generally, when you get to higher grades, more of the keyboard is required\u2026  That\u2019s the ending of the Nocturne in C# Minor by Chopin (really famous, I love it, play it all the time). As you can see the last note range is likely\u2026 over 32 notes. Grade 7 (ABRSM), if you\u2019re curious.  That\u2019s a small part of the middle section of the Nocturne in D Minor by Chopin (again Chopin lol). Just to save you the work, those bottom notes are just 4 semitones under the lowest key on the piano. Then the top notes (right hand) are above middle C. Which, as you can see, probably over 32 notes. Grade 8 (ABRSM), if you\u2019re curious. I mean, you can play these songs with a 32 note piano. You would just need a huge amount of editing these pieces and it would likely not sound as good. TIP: Don\u2019t try to use 32 note pianos for piano exams. ",

            "answer_text": "Anything. You just have to make adaptations if you are reading music, not be a slave to the notation and watch your octaves. I am actually playing a choral concert tomorrow night and the keyboard they have for me has only 61 notes and the piano score goes well beyond both ends. If I am improvising or faking it, it is not an issue because I am thinking in terms of notes rather than a score dictating where my hands are supposed to be. My choir sings in nursing homes a few dozen times a year and many of the pianos are in rough shape. In those cases you just learn where the bad notes are and avoid them, substitute something else or, as I like to do, revel in its ineffable crappiness.  ",
