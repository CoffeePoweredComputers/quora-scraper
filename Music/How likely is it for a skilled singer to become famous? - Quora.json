            "answer_text": "There are different levels of celebrity. You can be a local celebrity; regional celebrity and then, even if you are a national celebrity, there are still the A-list celebrities. I am a bit turned off if an artist tells me that their main goal is to become famous because it is a very elusive goal and most truly great artists have the need to make music, no matter the level of success. I am much more likely to take someone seriously if they approach me and say, I want to be able to make a good living as a singer because it\u2019s really all I want to do. Or, how can I be a successful singer (and I then ask, \u201cwhat is your definition of success?\u201d) The chances of an extremely skill singer with everything it takes (\u201cstar quality\u201d, true talent, attractive, hard working with a thick enough skin to take brutal criticism and constant rejection) are very very slim. If you would count all of the A-list singers alive and active, perhaps you have a few thousand\u2026.even if there are 10,000, balance that against the millions of people in the world. Even if there are only 1 million aspiring singers (and believe me there are more) you are talking about a teeny tiny percentage who \u201cmake it\u201d. When I was working in talent development, we got hundreds of submissions per month from people wanting a record deal and our company was not a record label. So, as I have told many aspiring artists, if this information discourages you, you probably don\u2019t have the drive to get there; however, if this issues a challenge to you and you are willing to work hard and take the chance, you should go for it.

            "answer_text": "Well you have to be more than just a skilled singer. I see this always as a three staged journey; First you learn to sing the right tones. Are you able to make exact steps? A third, a quarter, a fifth, a major seventh?Then you\u2019ll learn to make music with those notes. Can you improvise, can you harmonise a second or third voice on an existing melody? If so you can maybe start as a backing vocal.And then comes the most important part. Can you tell a story, can you relay emotions? When you\u2019re busking in the streets can you make people stop in their tracks and get their attention? Just with singing.Great. Now you can consider yourself a skilled singer. The next step is part luck, part people you know. Because without some connections you\u2019ll be heavy relying on your luck. ",
