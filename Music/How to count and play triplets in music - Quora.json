            "answer_text": "Triplets are three notes in the time of two. Three quavers where only two should be. So you would fit three quavers into one crotchet beat. Here's counting in 4/4 time where you meet the triplet on beat three: 4/4 One two three-and-a four. Tap your foot to march time, counting 4s, then when you're ready change to the line above. Practise counting when you walk, making some bests one-and -a, or two-and -a. ",

            "answer_text": "For the simplest one is by timing the time-signature by 3/2. Assume it is 4/4 and I have quaver triplets, then I would count it like I count 12/8. Then every 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th notes, I\u2019d give it an accent til I\u2019m familiar with the beat. And then take out the beats other than the accented notes. Gotta excel it first before moving on to minim triplets in 5/4. HEHE. ",
