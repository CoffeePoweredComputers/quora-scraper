            "answer_text": "It's probably quite complex. Folk is pretty popular (obviously nowhere near pop and rap etc) but I'll take a guess you mean whybitvisn't more mainstream or on air more often. You have several factors including the type of song and the type of artist as well as the perceptions of record companies and radio stations etc The latter are probably the biggest problem: they don't think it sells, it's not considered \u201ccool\u201d hence gets less airplay, so less people hear it. There can also be dynamucs within the scene itself. \u201cFolk\u201d sounds can roughly be divided into genuine old \u201ctraditional\u201d songs and modern material written ir played in a style based on the traditional material. But some people add thungs like which instruments get used (thing Bib Dylan going electric), tempo, technique etc. Some people want to treat folk like a museum piece and decry anything new, which is actually pretty funny because by nature folk music has always developed. Somewhere you'll find old players moaning about innovations and developments which nowadays are seen as sacred (old Irish players once complained all the youngsters were playing reels, not jigs). A good example of this was the argument between some Irish \u201ctraditionalists\u201d and The Pogues (who arguably did more for promoting folk music to younger, more diverse audiences). The traddies, who were excellent musicians and played great stuff, were scathing about The Pogues (although many later changed their minds) because of their more punk based sound. The same happened earlier with folk rock groups etc. This hardcore traditionalist image, ideas of East European folk dance groups etc kind of confuses the music companies, who are too ready to stick all diverse forms of folk under one banner. Because they can't work out how to package it, they focus more on other things. Still, every now and then something pops up as a surprise hit and shows that when people hear folk songs they often like them. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, musicians and scholars have been trying to define \"folk songs\" and determine what is a folk song for decades. I've heard:-If you know who wrote it, it ain't a folk song.-All songs are folk songs...I ain't heard no horse sing 'em (Big Bill Broonzy. . .)-Three chords and an acoustic guitar-If it takes more than two trips to get your gear from the van to the stage, it ain't folk.-It's been passed down through oral tradition-It's a four letter word that starts with \"F\", ends with \"K\" and if you use it, your songs won't get played on the radio. (Catfish Willie)Folky songs (Roots, Americana/Canadiana, or whatever folks are calling this genre these days) are still popular in certain circles. There are many folk festivals every summer drawing huge crowds. ",
