            "answer_text": "95% of Mexicans have at least 20% Native American DNA, however only 20% of Mexicans are full or predominantly (80%+ Amerindian DNA), so that leaves about 75% of Mexicans who are mixed-blood Amerindians (about 15% are Castizos, 15% are Harnizos, 20% are Indo-Mestizos, & 25% are Balanced Mestizos), the Harnizos & Castizos are mostly mainly concentrated in the northern & western parts of the country, while the Indo-Mestizos are mainly concentrated in the southern & eastern parts of the country, while Balanced Mestizos are found throughout Mexico. Full or predominantly Amerindians (also known as Indigenas) are mainly found in southern Mexican states like Oaxaca, Chiapas, & Yucatan, but can also be found in other parts of Mexico, but mainly in isolated tribal areas, the Indigenas are found in mainstream society in states like Oaxaca & Chiapas, meanwhile in states like Jalisco, Zacatecas, & Chihuahua, they are mainly found in only in isolated tribal areas, & that\u2019s due to more heavy racism & the tribes in the north are not as numerous & advanced as they are in the south. Here in the states, Native American usually means someone who is a North American Native (usually from US, but sometimes Canada included as well), & that\u2019s because the US & Canada has always felt more superior to Latin America, due to main reasons such as Nordicism, more developed economies, higher European populations, more heavy racism, hispanophobia, Anti-Mexican sentiment, & the anti-illegal immigration movement. In the immigration debate, when a Mexican Amerindian tells a right-wing white person to go back to Europe, they would either say go back to mexico or you people came from Asia, so you guys are immigrants too, & this even happens with US Amerindians as well, not the go back to mexico part, but the Asian origin part, like last year, when those white catholic conservative kids were told go back to Europe by two US native males, & they told the native males, you guys came from Asia, & even brought up the out of Africa theory, how all humanity is from Africa, so there nobody indigenous to this continent, which is weird for them to make such statement, since they are christian conservatives, & they usually don\u2019t believe in anything associated with \u201cNaturalism\u201d as they call it, which includes the Out of Africa theory as well, even If our ancestors came from Asia, Africa, or wherever, it was a long time ago, & Different races & sub-races evolve over time, they make a similar statement about the Bantu in South Africa, as they claim that the Khoisans were the original South Africans, & that the Afrikaners were there before the Bantu, which has been proved to be false, Bantus been in South Africa at least 500 years before the time of Jesus, which has already been nearly 3,000 years ago from today, while the first white settlers didn\u2019t arrive in South Africa until 1652, only a few hundred years ago, however they landed around the Cape of Good Hope, where there were only Khoisans, however there were Bantus in others parts where it\u2019s now present-day South Africa, however this is usually cherry-picked by white nationalists in order to feel indigenous to South Africa, which is similar to many right-wing whites (including white nationalists) here in the states when it refers to our race here in the Americas, despite us being here for at least 10,000 years, & Columbus didn\u2019t land in this continent until 1492, which is just over 500 years ago. What I find extremely ridiculous & disrespectful, is that a so-called \u201cCherokee\u201d who is predominantly White, like Bill John Baker, gets all the tribal benefits, & enjoys life as an \u201cNative\u201d, meanwhile us Mexicans & Chicanos are usually 20%+ Amerindian nearly all of the time are seen as illegals in our own land, & struggle with life here in the states especially with the political climate right now, what I also don\u2019t understand, why do white Americans identify as \u201cmestizo\u201d, or \u201cbiracial\u201d despite being only like 1/64 Cherokee, is like a Black American who is 1/8 white identifying as \u201cmulatto\u201d or \u201cbiracial\u201d only because he had a white great-grandfather, I don\u2019t care about racial purity, you don\u2019t need to be 100% of something to be a member of a race.

            "answer_text": "Mexicans are a nationality that consists of both Europeans and the precursor Aztec and similar civilizations that inhabited the land on which Mexico sits, and much of their population is mixed race between them. Consequently, there is certainly a large share of \u201cnative\u201d genetics and ancestry within the Mexican population overall, just as there is a great deal of Spanish ancestry, but it is worth noting that the Mexicans are not \u201cNative American\u201d in any sense related to the United States. Something I feel obliged to mention is that there is often a political argument along the lines that Mexicans should be allowed to immigrate to the United States freely because they are in large part \u201cNative American\u201d. I know this wasn\u2019t part of your question, so disregard it if it isn\u2019t relevant, but if it is, please understand that Mexicans have no historical claim or relationship to the United States. The tribes that traditionally existed in the United States and those that existed in Mexico were never friends, they were bitter enemies, from wildly different cultural groups religiously, socially, and linguistically. Even in the time where Mexico briefly controlled the American Southwest (purely a remnant of the Spanish Empire with no historical or cultural connections to that land), their sparse and thinly populated settlements were under constant siege and attack by Native American forces, who actively sought to exterminate them. The United States actually had to protect their tiny population after conquering the southwest, and that population was wildly grateful to finally have the protection of a responsive and sympathetic government. That population never left the United States, but was never significant either. ",

            "answer_text": "I live in California too. You can learn in detail by looking up the Mexican-American war, or the Annexation of Texas. Californians learn about this in school.California was part of Mexico prior to the Mexican-American war 1846-1848. At that time, Mexico had only been independent from Spain for about twenty years. The monarchy had little time or resources to engage in war. They gave incentive to Americans to move to their Texas territory with the idea that they would act like a buffer to protect the Mexicans from the native people from the American side (there was a history of attacks). Instead, those Texans tried to annex, become their own country, Mexico saw that as a problem, United States sent troops.... Two years of war...trade of cash... now California to Texas is part of the USA. Ok... That's the brief political history so you see why we are mixed races but still all Californians. Native Americans in California  who have been here for many generations, have been present during Spanish, Mexican and  American rule. Many Mexicans who move here have lineage from indegeunous people of north and Central America. You will also come across a lot of Americans who have Mexican ancestory but look nothing like indegeunous people. That is typically because their ancestors had the Spanish bloodline. Other interesting things that can help you understand Californians; some of the first settlers in Los Angeles were African Americans. Many Chinese came to build the railroad. Many punjabis came to work the farms. A large number of Japanese settled here. The government paid Mormons (who had been driven out of Missouri and were in desperate need of money) to come. Many of these new comers were drawn in by the gold rush, industry, newspapers, railroads. The local people mixed with the newcomers. A term we use to describe our mixed culture is \"melting pot\". I hope you're enjoying adding your flavor into the mix. ",

            "answer_text": "Mexico Is Home to DNA That's a World Apart, Study Shows \u201cgenetic studies Mexico consistently shows a European admixture comparable to countries that report white populations of 52% - 77% (in the case of Chile and Costa Rica, who average 51% & 60% European admixture respectively, while studies in the general Mexican population have found European ancestry ranging from 56% going to 60%,64% and up to 78%\u2026Mexico's northern regions have the greatest European population and admixture. In the northwest, the majority of the relatively small indigenous communities remain isolated from the rest of the population, and as for the northeast, the indigenous population was eliminated by early European settlers, becoming the region with the highest proportion of whites during the Spanish period. However, recent immigrants from southern Mexico have been changing, to some degree, its demographic trends\u201d So it may depend on where they come from in Mexico. \u201cIn 2011 a large scale mitochondrial sequencing in Mexican Americans revealed 85 to 90% of mtDNA lineages of Native American origin, with the remainder having European (5-7%) or African ancestry (3-5%). Thus the observed frequency of Native American mtDNA in Mexican/Mexican Americans is higher than was expected on the basis of autosomal estimates of Native American admixture for these populations i.e. ~ 30-46%\u201d Also male lineage is more likely to be European and female indigenous (i.e. the Spanish men were the dads). \u201cstudies suggests a tendency relating a higher European admixture with a higher socioeconomic status and a higher Amerindian ancestry with a lower socioeconomic status: a study made exclusively on low income Mestizos residing in Mexico City found the mean admixture to be 0.590, 0.348, and 0.062 for Amerindian, European and African respectively whereas the European admixture increased to an average of around 70% on mestizos belonging to a higher socioeconomical level.\u201d So it also depends on economic status; the poorer immigrants are more likely to be indigenous. It is such a mess I doubt you can accurately identify the whole population at once. ",

            "answer_text": "A little different answer than the rest, but an answer anyway. In the Spanish wars of conquest, the soldiers were mostly men with Moorish blood and the officers were men without Moorish blood. There obviously were a lot more soldiers than officers, and once conquest was finished, the soldiers just stayed and became civilians. It is STILL a thing amongst older hispanic persons to refer to themselves as \u201cSpanish\u201d (as opposed to those other hispanics), and one was expected to marry within one\u2019s class. This extended to being elected, good jobs, all kinds of things. It doesn\u2019t seem to include having Indian blood so much as it does not having Moorish blood. Seriously - my father-in-law, who is 79, rants about this sometimes. He\u2019s \u201cSpanish, dammit\u201d, and if you look at him, you\u2019d figure he\u2019s French. Curly hair and everything, French nose. Because\u2026 officers from Northern Spain, as opposed to the south where those soldiers with Moorish blood came from. He ain\u2019t no Mexican, says he. His kids find this all amusing, but I\u2019d assume in his age group (and older) one did not marry below (or above) one\u2019s station. It was also more okay for a Spanish person to marry a white person, not so much for a darker hispanic. All I can think of is Columbia had fewer soldiers, or fewer soldiers that stayed. Also, I have seen people mention this on Quora, that a decent chunk of \u201cMexicans\u201d have black blood (ex-slaves) - look at Cuba, it has the same diversity of skin color and (I think) much of the same cultural traditions. Perhaps, in Columbia, there weren\u2019t so many slaves as elsewhere\u2026 anyway, genetically, one gets into that the Moors were from Africa, etc etc. All anyone seems to remember is \u201cMuslims! Look like Arabs! And they were all driven out of Spain!\u201d, but that\u2019s not really the way it worked. Libya, Morocco, etc are not Arabia. Welcome to our world of Stars on Thars. I would post a Dr Suess picture, but I\u2019d get my answer collapsed. ",

            "answer_text": "In theory anyone who habit currently the American continent are not native. Indigenous civilizations of America derived from several groups who emigrated 14.000 and 13.00 years ago from Asia to America. We always think that all the population before the Spanish/Britain/French occupations to American continent was just only \u201cindigenous\u201d, but at the Spanish arrival to Mexico exists thousands of different civilizations with a complex panorama which have previously immigrations and social relations. From XVI century to our times America received people from all over the world, including Europe, Asia and Africa ethnic groups. As the genetic studies can shown us today, a standard people from Colombia or Mexico it\u2019s a complex mix from at least four ethnic groups. Sadly contemporary United Stated ideas still using old, outdated and discriminatory theories continues grouping populations into arbitrary categories like \"Black\", \"Latin\" or \"Native\". Many United States people think into ignorant and racist terms and put in the same bag a lot of indigenous civilizations which lived for centuries into their actual territory simply calling \u201camerican native\u201d to all indigenous populations which have every of them an own language, culture and identity. We can follow the path of ethnics interactions and according to language developments for an example of the Nahuatl, we can detect in the same ethnic group to Aztecs and populations from Arizona. So *maybe* someone from Mexico can have mayan, zapotec or h\u00f1a\u00f1\u00fa ancestors but maybe not. It is very hypothetical. ",

            "answer_text": "If you mean that Mexicans have native american ancestry, the answer is yes. Roughly, 85\u201390% of Mexicans have native ancestry, anywhere from small to greater degrees. Other ancestries include African, Asian, Etc. When the Spanish conquered Mexico, the soldiers, having brought no women from from Spain, were more than willing to take native (mainly Aztec) women first as concubines, then as wives when they converted to Christianity. It was understandable, since both cultures had many common elements. Eventually, the two streams merged to form one river. One example is the Virgin of Guadalupe, which is an image of the Virgin Mary, with native features, such as brownish skin and brown eyes. The fact that the Virgin of Guadalupe appeared on Tepeyac hill, which had been dedicated to an Aztec goddess makes it even more evident. I always thought the very same thing had happened everywhere else in Latin America, until I visited Peru almost 20 years ago. The conquest of Peru was a brutal affair compared to the conquest of Mexico, and I couldn\u2019t help noticing many details. For example, in a church outside Cuzco, there was a statue of the Apostle James, riding his horse into battle while trampling an Inca shaman. The original version of this statue in Spain has the Apostle James trampling a moor. Not a very subtle way of making a point, if you ask me. Not conciliatory at all. ",

There is a small sprinkling of pure-ish Caucasian population made up of Spanish, Anglo-American, Jewish and other European races. These people very much own and run Mexico, they very rarely mix or inter marry with native Americans. They are very proud and tend to assert a form of racial superiority over the natives; they live with their own, in gated communities in wealthy districts. They lead Mexico in every sphere of life such as media, finance, academia, politics, law, defence, business, etc.. The rest of the population is about 95% native American: people who are native to what is Mexico today, and those that were driven out from what is the United States today, just north of the border. These people are really the downtrodden masses who lost out on just about everything; their country, its resources, its cultivable land, its water, its best jobs and even political power. How very sad indeed? ",

            "answer_text": "No. That question makes no sense since Mexican is a nationality, and depending on who you ask, Native American is a race, or an indigenous person of the United States of America. As stated above, Mexican is a nationality, and Mexico is a very mixed and diverse nation. The majority of Mexicans are mestizo, meaning they have both European and indigenous DNA. However, the term mestizo in Mexico doesn\u2019t have the same meaning as it did in colonial times, or the meaning many Americans think it does(of it meaning 50% Spanish 50% indigenous). Mestizo is more of a cultural term now than it is a racial one. There are mestizos who are 90% European and 10% indigenous, and mestizos who are 90% indigenous and 10% European. This is why on the 1921 census, there were southern states with a higher % of whites than northern states that clearly had a higher %. According to this [1], indigenous Mexicans make almost 10% of the population, while according to the Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Geograf\u00eda[2], in 2015, 6.5% of Mexico spoke an indigenous language. 494 municipalities had indigenous language speaker populations of more than 40%. Around half of the municipalities were located in Oaxaca, Mexico\u2019s most indigenous state.

They are a minority of Native Americans that live in Mexico, who still speak their indigenous languages, and clearly by their features. They are Amerindian looking, But the majority of Mexicans are Spanish, in origins they claim to be Native American too lay claim to the United States, but fact is when the Southwest was Mexico. Native Americans were 2nd class citizen being hunted for their by Mexican bounty hunters. Today the Mexican American in New Mexico show a serve amount of Racism towards Native Americans and Actually commit hate crimes against Natives in Farmington, Albuquerque. So no Mexican are not Natives. They are no different from the Anglo Colonizer, it's why the speak Spanish. ",

            "answer_text": "This study puts it squarely:Genetic admixture in three Mexican Mestizo populations based on D1S80 and HLA-DQA1 loci. Mestizo populations show evidence of admixture with predominantly Spanish-European (50-60%) and Amerindian (37-49%) contributions; the African contribution (1-3%) is minor. Now, if you take into account about 60% of Mexico\u2019s population are Mestizos, about 20% are Indigenous (i.e. those who have Native American ancestry > 90%, with very few European and African admixture, as 90% of Mexico\u2019s population is mixed race to some extent), about 20% are Caucasians, and Afro-Mexicans being less than 3% of population, who most people don\u2019t ever see as they tend to be concentrated in specific coastal places.Mestizos in Mexico Afro-Mexicans Now, economic inequalities from colonial times have been perpetuated and even reinforced themselves after independence, so the Mexican 1%-ers tend disproportionately to be white Caucasians (about 95% of them) while the bottom 20% tend to be mostly indigenous and black people and the middle economic ground being mostly Mestizo. Next, ask yourself - who\u2019s most likely to emigrate to look economic opportunities abroad? Obvious, those in the lowest bracket mostly, followed by those in the lower middle class. There you have your answer as to why the Mexicans you see living and working in the USA tend to be disproportionately be those with more indigenous ancestry. ",

On the indigenous part, before the arrival of Europeans Mexico was populated by many different civilizations, with some similar physical characteristics but there were also some differences in height, skin completion, body type amongst them. When the Europeans came, the northern part of Mexico was very sparsely populated and so the mix of indigenous and europeans somewhat reflects more of the later. Central and Southern Mexico had bigger indigenous populations organized in more sophisticated societies, so the influx of European blood was relatively smaller. Also, the \u201cwhite\u201d population concentrated in the larger and richer cities, to this very day (with a few exceptions such as \u201cLos Altos\u201d in the State of Jalisco). If you happened to visit southern rural Mexico, chances are so saw people that were mostly of local indigenous origin. ",

            "answer_text": "Population density. The indigenous population in the Empires of today\u2019s Mexico (Aztec and Mayan) was very large. Much much larger than the one in today\u2019s Colombia. So there was the same blending, but many more indigenous by an order of magnitude. It is estimated that at the time of the conquest, Tenochtitlan (today\u2019s Mexico City) alone had 300,000 people and was one of the largest cities in the world (and it still is today). All the cities around it were also very big, and you can see that by going to any of the many pyramid ruins (there\u2019s hundreds of them all over central Mexico, with large plazas and central squares, full aqueducts and other \u201clarge population maintenance\u201d facilities). The people\u2019s origin story of Mexico City has the famous eagle foundation legend that we remember by the emblazon in the flag, but it also mentions that the Mexica, after looking for a place to settle and not finding one that was not taken, also tried to settle along the outskirts of the lake, and continuously got kicked out by cities that claimed the land as theirs (which gave them extra satisfaction when later they dominated those same cities from their capital built on water using Chinampas, but I digress). This suggests that the populations around the entire lakebed (all the cities surrounding Tenochtitlan) was also very high even 200 years earlier (high enough to continuously raise armies to kick out interloper settler groups, even strong ones like the Mexica). They were also urban and advanced to such an extent that the Spaniards kept the emperor as a figurehead and intermarried the Moctezuma royalty (which is a Spanish dukedom to this day), meaning these very large populations weren\u2019t exterminated, but were converted then intermarried with. Simply not enough Spaniards existed to \u201cdilute\u201d the genetics of that many people, particularly as they had all of Latin America to conquer and settle. ",

Therefore, the mix of \u201craces\u201d in Mexico has a more local component and in Argentina it may look more towards European but not completely. If we could measure in percentage how mestizo a person is, it would not matter at all, since anyone being 10% mestizo is a mestizo, as much as a 90% mestizo. Both are mestizos, both know it and they both call themselves mestizos. It is irrelevant how they look. A mestizo has combined ancestry despite of the fact on how he/she looks. ",

Criollos who do immigrate are allowed to assimilate into the anglo population, and people tend not to be aware they are Mexican. The criollos who lived in the part of Mexico that was annexed by the US have been assimilated. Most Mexicans are meztisos. Mexico I think has a higher percentage than other countries in the Americas of people who speak an indigenous language as their primary language. There are very few Mexicans with African or Asian ancestry. ",

By comparison, Colombia would have certainly a much less populated territory. Europeans eventually settled heavily in Mexico and also in Colombia, but in Mexico the indigenous population was absolutely dominant because, despite all the epidemics and slaughters, it was simply too large, and the Europeans certainly had to accomodate and mingle more intensely with the natives in order to consolidate their settlement of the territory. Colombia needed to import thousands of African slaves during colonisation, while that was exceptional in Mexican colonisation. They already had a relatively large population to provide the (often forced) labor. ",

In central and specially southern Mexico there was a larger indigenous population and people will definitely look more indigenous. In northern and western Mexico you will find more European looking populations. In fact there are even a few communities that are completely white, as there are some communities that are completely indigenous.On average, each country as whole, I don\u2019t think Colombia and Mexico will be too different but of course throughout Latin America you will see countries that are mostly of European decent (e.g. Argentina) and others where they are a much smaller minority (e.g. Bolivia).
