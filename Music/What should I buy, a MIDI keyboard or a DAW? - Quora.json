            "answer_text": "Well that depends on what are your objectives with music production. I suggest you go for the DAW you have a lot of options(ableton live, logic pro, fl studio, cubase, presonus studio one, studio reason, cakewalk, pro tools etc) this is very important because is the hub of your studio, Cakewalk is free and have the all the features that you need for music production, but as you advance you should upgrade to ableton live 10 an easy, fast and flexible software for music creation and performance. Go for the free trials and see how it works but you have to test and work consistently to decide which one works for you and develop a workflow that allows you to create music and then go for the MIDI keyboard. With MIDI keyboard You also have a lot of options available too there is no such thing as the best midi, the most important is the workflow that you develop in your music production with the tools that you have, this are some budget midi controllers and then decide which one is best for you depending on your needs and what are you doing. Alesis V25 Nektar Impact LX25 Novation Launchkey Mini Native Instruments Komplete Kontrol M32 Arturia Minilab MKii Akai MPK Mini: M-Audio Oxygen 25 Some of these have more advanced and pricey options but you have to review and compare and it depends of your objectives.

            "answer_text": "Buy the keyboard first, here is my reasoning: It will be difficult to find a decent and free keyboard, if not impossible. However, a decent and free DAW is pretty easy to come by. There is Cakewalk, which I used for years before switching to Studio One, and there is Reaper which is free to use but should be purchased after a few months (~$60 US.) There is LMMS which is free but I\u2019ve never used it\u2026 If you are new to music creation, your DAW won\u2019t really matter since you\u2019ll be learning production terminology which applies to all DAWs, though they have different means of accomplishing the same tasks.

            "answer_text": "Like the others said\u2026a MIDI keyboard \u2014 by which we assume a controller keyboard \u2014 doesn\u2019t do anything by itself. Makes little clicky clacky noises maybe. You can run a sound module off them for stage performance but the usual reason to get them is to use with a DAW. But all is not lost. Many controller keyboards are sold with some sort of cheap-and-basic software in the same box. It may not be good, and it may be adware/nagware/crippleware, but it will give you a taste and let you refine what it is you want to look for when you upgrade to the real thing. ",

Most of theDAWs give you a vitrual midi keyboard or you can directly input notes and beats via midi editor or midi event editors , but that may not be easy if you are just starting out. ",
