            "answer_text": "My two favorite country artists to come out in the last decade both appeared around the same time. Kacey Musgraves and Thomas Rhett both released their first albums in 2013. Musgraves was the darling of the award season with her debut album Same Trailer Different Park, while Rhett delivered It Goes Like This later that year. Seemingly on the same trajectory, they both had their best albums of the decade in 2018. Thomas Rhett\u2019s Life Changes had two of my favorite Rhett songs of the decade - the title cut and \u201cUnforgettable\u201d. Meanwhile, Kacey Musgraves released Golden Hour, which included it\u2019s title cut and \u201cHigh Horse\u201d - Musgraves surprised the music industry by winning the Grammy for Album of the Year for Golden Hour, beating out mainstream pop artists including Cardi B, Post Malone, and the monster soundtrack from \u201cBlack Panther\u201d. Musgraves even capped off the decade with her own Christmas show and introducing some new songs that I\u2019m sure will be Christmas standards.  ",

Kid Rock, and I say this because he went from doing Rock and Rap to playing country and honestly it suits him well. Just listen to a few of his country songs and disagree that he isn\u2019t a pretty good country artist.  One of my favorite country songs  ",
