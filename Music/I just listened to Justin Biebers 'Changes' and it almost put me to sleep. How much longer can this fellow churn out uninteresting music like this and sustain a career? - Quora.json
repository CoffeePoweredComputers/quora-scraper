The world is full of people who I don\u2019t think should have ever been recorded but who nonetheless manage to carve our a career for themselves. But I can choose not to listen to them. You can too. And, as it does not affect me in the slightest, more power to them. I wish I had been able to have a career as a musician as well, but I was not able to. Even if that had been one churning out formulaic and repetitive dross. ",

            "answer_text": "Once music was heard, and very few artists made video recordings. Radio and singles were the way artists got known. So the sixties and seventies were meant to be listened too. Gosh, they had to drag Karen Carpenter out from behind her drums. So in the sixties, the SP was the big seller, and the LP was a long way behind that LPs entered the singles chart. The \u2018White Album\u2019 by the beatles topped the singles chart in Sweden. Now, bands are largely visual stuff. You buy into an event, not a song. So songs are now rated by their visual presentation, not their acoustic one. Biebers looks good, and with a bit of background help, is passable as a musician. But it\u2019s his visual content that pulls the crowd. ",
