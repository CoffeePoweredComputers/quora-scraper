            "answer_text": "\u201cConsidered\u201d is one of those things that, while obviously subject to concensus, is ultimately subjective. So here\u2019s my take, one which I would wager is roughly shared by many other music fans. Buckethead has composed some great works. His various side-projects with other musicians have often produced at least one great record. However, Buckethead is too prolific for his own good. Now, I won\u2019t pass any judgement as to why he releases so much music, but the net effect on the listener is not only getting overwhelmed, it also leads to getting to the real gems in his vast ouvre. A lot of his stuff is technically impressive, but compositionally not all that. While he doesn\u2019t get as bad as some other shredders (or at least not as often, all things considered), one does get the feeling that if he had someone next to him helping him focus, he could have a considerably more concentrated streak of great albums, rather than putting out dozens a year where only a handful of those feel truly exceptional.

            "answer_text": "Yeah! as a contemporary guitarist goes, he could be considered among the better players of this generation. To me he\u2019s hit or miss, when hits he\u2019s dead on, when he misses, it isn\u2019t terrible, but he failed to capture that little thing that makes it a good piece of music. No one is going to say that sucked! but they could say \u201cI didn\u2019t get it\u201d, hence the down side of being a musical genius. Sometimes players get lost in the technical part of playing, and lose sight of the music. Think of David Gilmour, and his playing, generally the music got put first, and that sometimes separates great from damned good! Thanks! Robert ",

He can cross multiple genres and is a household name in most guitar circles, even though it may be hard to pinpoint a single \u201csong\u201d of his. In this regard he may be considered THE true contemporary guitarist, given the plethora of genres and subgenres out there these days. It\u2019s almost hard to keep up these days, and it\u2019s always been hard for me to keep up with what Buckethead is up to. ",
