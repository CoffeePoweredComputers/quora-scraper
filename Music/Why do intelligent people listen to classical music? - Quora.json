            "answer_text": "Great question, but one that probably isn't capacious enough to capture all the varieties of taste and intellect. Considering why intelligent people listen to classical music as well as all other kinds might unpack some of the assumptions that lead you to ask your question in the way you do. First, the ways in which intelligent people enjoy different kinds of music is all tangled up in conditions of class, regional context, education, and cultural situation.  Owing to our own cultural backgrounds, in other words, our tastes become a signifier, a short hand for where we came from. How we identify ourselves culturally is represented by our different tastes in food, TV shows, how we cut our hair, what kinds of theater we go to and books we read, what kinds of films do we watch, what do we wear, how do we sound (as in, what are our habits of speaking in to others from our home communities), and even the amount of physical space between two people talking. Taste is a cultural and class marker, a learned preference, a way of asserting identity on the world.  More broadly speaking, intellectual curiosity and imagination are nurtured and channeled in particular directions within different cultures.  A brilliant person in one of the over 100 uncontacted tribes on Earth, such as those that live on the Peru/Brazil border in the Amazon, wouldn't have what we First World/Western peoples would call \"functional literacy\"; they couldn't read and write the way Quora members do. Worse in some people's eyes, they'd probably have zero enjoyment of classical music. But the brightest among them can probably read miles of rainforest like a book, tracking movements of animals, vegetation growth, season, and any small change in stream or river flow with a close reading equal to any literary critic doing studying Dante's Inferno. They may well have as complex a music, perhaps atonal and not relying on the traditional octave our music does, but within their own scales and instruments and vocal performances -- and as their own ear has been trained by position, location, situation -- their music may well be as intricate and pleasing as any in the world. Second, to give a personal example, I grew up in a  middle-class home with professionals for parents, in a house with books everywhere. A recording of Dylan Thomas reading aloud \"Fern Hill\" was as likely as Stravinsky himself conducting the \"Rite of Spring\" and its magnificent opening bassoon solo. In my family it was as likely that we'd be listening to Herb Alpert, The Weavers, Buffy St. Marie, or Bach, Beethoven, Mozart's Requium, and Leonard Bernstein conducting Orff's Carmina Burana.   I took courses in Mozart and Haydn in high school. Dad would read Eldridge Cleaver and The Pentagon Papers as likely as he would read The New York Times, and all those texts and more were available to me. I was never told what I could read or not read, listen to or not listen to. It was a liberal household in the sense that as long as I was reading and exposed to a variety of texts and performances, I could develop as I wished. However, while I did pick and choose what I loved to read and hear, my palette was limited to the colors available, my tastes refined by a finite choice of options. I love baroque music to this day, but I never picked up my father's taste for opera. People tell me I'm intelligent, and I do love a lot of classical music. But I believe that that taste, those preferences, connect far more to my own late-20th-century upbringing in a First World country, a suburb of New York City, where the coin of the realm, a way to demonstrate intellectual prowess, was knowing a particular set of traditional European music. One of the best known classical music stations in New York City was playing the same 40 pieces, week after week, with hardly an interval for something new, atonal, or non-European. You might understand that shallow representation of the breadth of European music as teaching through repetition what are the 40 pieces of classical music that are most recognized and appreciated, and also demonstrate that the listener is conversant in the primary signifiers of upper-class tastes. Taste corresponds very well to class.  There is also a pretty close correlation between zip code and SAT score, which in some ways makes the same point. We learn the skills and preferences, for the most part, modeled for us -- whether in our own families and neighborhoods, or by what we see on TV in terms of who we want to become. We learn to love particular music -- and yes, it may rattle in our bones in particular pleasing ways; its rhythms (like the iambic rhythms of some of our oldest poems) may echo the heart beating, and we may even feel a visceral connection to it -- and what we learn to love, how we develop our tastes in music, is connected to what sounds we heard and told to appreciate when we were children.  And if we want to take it one step further, the idea that \"classical\" music might appeal more to smart people iterates the colonizing gesture of Europe, particularly England, on shaping the identity of the United States. Why do we speak a language called \"English\" today? Why are there English Departments in universities? Why did we rename many, many places, especially in the eastern US, to the names of English and French men? Imperialism. Because cultural currency in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in the USA was based on the notion that Western Europe was where all valuable culture (and taste, and cultural habits of understanding and knowing) originated. If you like classical music, the contemporary equation goes, you are part of an exclusive club that is almost entirely white, middle- or upper-middle class, connected with East Coast universities with long histories, and appreciate that all great art and literature and music comes primarily from Europe.  That is still the posture that the pedant or the snob takes, anyone who establishes his or her own superiority (to themselves and, they hope, others) by demonstrating sophistication, worldliness, and knowledge through their immersion in European traditions in music. Classical music lovers as superior in intelligence is simply a trope, a performance, a signifier. Such music buffs buttress their sense of intellectual superiority through their knowledge of fugues, concertos, and symphonies -- which have in common a European provenance, musical notation systems, and scores that helped make that music durable and portable across centuries.  But coexisting with the durability and portability that musical notation allows, is a persistence of the idea that high culture and real knowledge is located in Europe. And when we celebrate \"classical\" music, we are celebrating a tradition and European heritage that have come to represent the superior intellectual  (who is one step away from \"the effete\" in some American minds, an effete who likes only the weak tea of fugues, in compariston to the manly music being composed in an American idiom). Given that our country is no longer made up primarily of people of European heritage (who, mind you, in turn wiped out all the musical traditions of native Americans living here first), we can hear many wonderful musical traditions reworked and improvised in live performances, in ways that Bach or Mozart are not likely to be unwound. But still many are in the thralls of demonstrating their own intellect through disparaging country music, rap, hip hop,  or Frank Sinatra. So many of these distinctions are ones of class and region, and not of intellect. When intellectuals claim to like only First World, Western European, classical music, and thus embrace the contemporary stereotype of the out-of-touch professor, they may really be just signalling a lack of knowledge of many, many other rich and complex musical traditions. Intellectuals, and their elaborate explanations of musical knowledge to signify their own intelligence and prestige, may not understand that classical music can not only be wonderful, but that a taste for it is learned. And they may not see their own taste for classical music as a taste for that which is derivative, as a lingering affection for the jackboot of the imperialist. (I love being incendiary. I don't actually believe loving classical music is that bad. I just mean that it comes with its own trappings; and loving that kind of music is never just neutral, and it does far more than simply signify intelligence.) When we say opera is far more sophisticated than rap music, we are really stating a preference firmly rooted in cultural background, a \"taste\" that is guided as much by where we are from as it is by any innate quality of a particular musical piece. Not entirely, let me hasten to add; I personally think Bach's fugues for piano are among the most beautiful music I've ever heard, and they speak to me at a very deep level. Vivaldi's concerti for bassoon or English horn or cello or even his Four Seasons, likewise shake me in a delicious way. But I recognize that my taste is shaped as it is at least half because of where I came from; and I recognize that my taste springs as much from ignorance as it does from knowledge. ",

            "answer_text": "I'll go out on a limb and proclaim my assertion that there IS some correlation; but not necessarily direct causation...If someone whose bright and looks inherently into patterns in everyday life, out of appreciation for the higher wisdom gained, would in my opinion enjoy classical music. This is due largely because of something that they can see and understand at a higher level than many other people. This concept goes for anything i.e., Mathematics, music, art etc. On the lower end of the 'intelligence' spectrum, we typically would find those who are more into simple and easy concepts that do not cause frustration. I can see why music would portray why -no offense, many ignorant people would rather listen to lil' Wayne, juxtaposed to Beethoven, Bach, etc. The reason would be because to truly appreciate classical music and other forms of art, or mathematics, etc you need to see beyond the clashing of mere symbols, or lines on a chalk board. If you can see how intricate and well thought out, the depth of such, then you can learn to appreciate the beauty therein. To some people, such things are only a whimsical idea that bares no depth of interest, and they pass it by because of a lack of understanding. This is just a snippet of my idea and purposely negating other factors such as cultural influence of language or heritage, or even upbringing and wealth for that matter.  Now those typically not intelligent very well could appreciate such forms. This is by far not a black and white idea. However, obviously the more in depth you can understand, the more you can appreciate, therefore, the more searching you can and will do to find what else you can learn and appreciate to make life more meaningful.  EDIT: I did want to mention that this can easily be supported by the notion that intelligence level can be directly influenced by curiosity -> appreciation -> knowledge gained -> repeat.   ",
