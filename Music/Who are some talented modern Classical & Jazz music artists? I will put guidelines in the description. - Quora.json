I'll answer the original as in the screenshot; Who are some talented modern music artists?-  In this question, the term \u201cModern Music\u201d is difficult to interpret. It could be considered contemporary music or refer to the more technical and classical definition of orchestral pieces, and in either case it would be correct. From Wiki: Branches of Modern Music Modern Western art music can be divided into three branches. One is radical modern music, which encompasses all types that depart extremely from traditional Western music. The primary member of this branch is atonal music; another is music comprised of non-musical sounds (i.e. noise). TINY SUMMARY OF MODERN MUSIC (EXCLUDING OPERA)  \ufffcThe second branch of modern Western music is moderate modern, which departs less severely from tradition. Moderate modern music features heavy chromaticism, yet retains a sense of tonality, as well as other traditional conventions. The foremost moderate modern composer is Igor Stravinsky, often considered the greatest composer of the twentieth century. Stravinsky's most famous work is The Rite of Spring, a ballet. The third and final branch of modern Western music is major-minor tonal (i.e. music that features major-minor tonality). In terms of art music, this branch encompasses most film music and musicals; additionally, it includes most popular music. Thus, in terms of sheer audience size, major-minor tonality continues to dominate Western music. I spend most of my time listening to contemporary music. However, a lot of it doesn't involve a lot of of key changes, irregular time signatures, various instruments at an orchestral level or meaningful lyrics. Most popular music is paired down rather simply. In poplar music, the lyrics are usually kept simple; Lyrics need to be catchy- there needs to be a \u201chook.\u201d The lyrics repeat. That's the formula. If it is catchy, people play it again and again, they relate to it, understand it. Not everyone is a musician. Simplicity sells albums. Lyrics don't need to be overly complicated, or even meaningful to become hits. The Beatles made a killing singing nonsense lyrics. There are usually three major parts to a song: The VerseThe ChorusThe BridgeThat's it. It can become confusing to an average listener if lyrics are needlessly poetic, verbose, or too complicated to be understood. There doesn\u2019t need to be extra bridges and key changes added in, in order for it to be complex. Think of all the super-simple children's songs we sing to kids in order to teach them to read. Repetition is the key. They are borderline moronic in structure, and yet they have trained up geniuses in this world! They are simple to learn. Anyone can learn to sing them. Perhaps that is what is so appealing about the simplicity of pop music today. It is all-inclusive. As it should be. Music shouldn't be stuffy and high-brow. It's for the people! Additonally, music doesn\u2019t need to be performed by a symphony orchestra with multiple instruments to be beautiful. But you already knew that. Plenty of solo acts were brilliant. Most bands stick to the regular formula: There is usually rhythm section consisting of percussion and bass, accompanied, perhaps by both a lead and rhythm guitar player, as well as keys/synthesizer and/or even a DJ/drum machine. Of course, the vocalists/rappers are front and center. Sometimes, there are strings and horns, but more often that is left to studio tweaking during recording sessions. The average band starts out small. The more members playing in a band, the less each member makes when the gig is paid up, and the money divided at the end of the evening. Five people stand to take home more money than a seven-piece band. Less is more. As far as time signatures go, Western music doesn\u2019t stray too far from what we are accustomed to. Dave Brubeck's Take Five may be recognized as having 5/4 meter, but some may find that jazz number difficult to dance to. There is a reason a lot of people don't realize Take Five was written with lyrics. The meter makes it one difficult song to sing along to. It isn't standard Western tempo. It is therefore mostly performed as an instrumental piece. Take Five Lyrics Here is The String Cheese Incident performing their instrumental bluegrass version of Take Five:  Here the count? Five. Hence the title. Most music is standard with a 4/4 beat or even 3/4 \u201cwaltz\u201d time signature. It was difficult to find a song which hit every requirement, but I found one. I'll post an example of one of my favorite songs by composer Hans Zimmer, The Rainmaker:  Aquarium Rescue Unit (Oteil Burbridge, Kofi Burbridge, Paul Henson, Jimmy Herring, Jeff Sipe) Stand Up People, hits several elements nicely:  ",
