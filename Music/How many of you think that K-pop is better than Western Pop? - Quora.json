            "answer_text": "I don't think but i believe they are 100000002% better. K-pop idols are by far the most talented , gorgeous and hard working idols i\u2019ve ever seen. The world only hates them cuz they are biased to western pop or merely because k idols sing in Korean , a language people cant understand. K idols are so talented. Like seriously , they sing , dance , rap, act. They can simply do anything. AND their concerts , i think other idols should learn something from them. K concerts are at a different level of appreciation. Its undescribable how eye-catching and good they actually are. Where you got the western idols only singing , running and switching places on stage , jumping had hopping to the beats , k idols are here , dancing with perfection , singing beautifully , rapping and even dancing on water , using props such as light sabers. The entire stadium illuminated by blinding lights , colourful lazers and lightsticks. Another thing which is unique about kpop is their concept. There is no harm in having more than 5 members in a group. And most unique , the light sticks. So cool that every group has got a light stick with group's logo on it and of a particular colour. Now EXO introduced colour changing lightsticks ,thats again awesome. K-idols are even very fashion forward. Their airport fashion portrays it the best. Western idols like to play casual so they are always opting for pajamas and comfy tees but k idols amaze all by their awesome fashion senses. ( p.s that k idol look extremely handsome , gorgeous , beautiful , sassy etc etc on airports with their sunglasses on. ) and the hard work they do is not unnoticed. I\u2019m not saying that western idols don't work hard. I\u2019m just saying that korean idols work 10x harder. They have to master extremely difficult choreographies , go on recordings, attend award shows, shoot for mvs , shoot for dramas , all happening simultaneously, one after the other. Still they manage to give their best. Can you imagine than only in 15 minutes of their 3 extended hours concert, they sing 5 to 6 hyped songs with so much energy to be put on the choreography but still throughout the concert they seem active and fresh. I wonder sometimes what special food they eat to be over flowing with such energy. And one more thing , if you happen to listen to their covers of english songs , you'll actually find their vocals better than most other western idols. Its true, just because they sing in korean ( well still i\u2019m amazed ) , we cant judge them. K idols put true emotions in their songs. If you happen to listen to their ballads ,you\u2019ll definitely find yourself crying. Extremely strong vocals, so soothing. And lastly If you are biased towards beautiful faces , korean idols will never disappoint you. Who says boys look ugly with makeup ?? watch baekhyun , taehyung , xiumin and jk with makeup smashed faces and then judge your own opinion. While now if your western idols look gross with makeup , i\u2019m sorry then cuz koreans look beautiful ( even boys ) with makeup. Imagine beiber with makeup. So gross right. Korean idols look younger. That's why they look good with makeup on. Now compare 24 years old Harry Styles to 24 years old Oh sehun. They look so different. Wonder if koreans even age. enough written now. Nonkpopers hate kpop for no damn reason. Mind me that i pity non kpopers. They are overlooking actual talents and legends , REAL AND TRUE L.E.G.E.N.D.S. ",

            "answer_text": "I do. They can\u2019t even be compared, starting from the most obvious one that most of Western pop is in English and most of Kpop is in Korean. Because with Western pop you only get a (sometimes) talented voice singing songs which are rarely written by the singer themselves and usually has a whole team behind them. Their music videos usually are filled with over-sexualization of men and women, have no deeper meaning and have no interesting shots other than the close ups of singers in black and white filter to make them appear more artistic. You do not see diversity in lyrics. And when you go to the concerts it\u2019s usually the main singer with multiple back-up dancers, trained dancers, who do nothing but wiggle and twerk on the spot. Now let\u2019s enter the colorful world of Kpop, even though I only stan one group, BTS, I appreciate the genre. There are roughly three categories, girl groups, boy groups and solos. Promising individuals are recruited by entertainment agencies and trained to be not just singers but charismatic performers. They hone their singing, rapping, dancing, modelling, stage presence, language skills and heck even their individual style for years before debuting, they have instructors for that. Think of each group as trained warriors who are pit against one another and some fail some survive. Each group has a different style, some are vocal based some rap based and their songs reflect the difference. As a hardcore ARMY I can fully explain with BTS. These seven boys trained for 2\u20133 years, two of them were professional dancers, one a top student at his dance school and the other part of an underground dancing crew. Two of them were underground rappers and had a reputation of their own before they joined BTS, one was an individual perusing acting degree and the last one the youngest is the golden one as he went to America to learn different dance styles, can rap rather decently, is the main vocalist and is a jack of all trade. Apart from these abilities BTS also compose, produce and write most of their own songs. The lyrics they write range from social issues, to political to gender issues to heartbreak to mental health to literature. They train hard every day for their singing, dancing, rapping, composing and production. And with so much effort, the final product is an absolute BOP with the live performances amazingly energetic.
