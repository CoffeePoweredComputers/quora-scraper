            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to elaborate on a theory that my faulty memory says I read in a book by Desmond Morris, but I can\u2019t be 100% sure, so please just work with me here a moment\u2026 When compared to other mammals, humans are rather upright. So take a moment and imagine a female orangutan walking across a field. She\u2019s walking on her knuckles right? She\u2019s bent at her hips, right? And now imagine yourself as a male orangutan standing behind her as she walked away. You\u2019d see all of her ape-like junk right out in the open\u2026 The hair. The lips. The slit.  Now imagine a human female walking this way. And imagine her from behind. You\u2019d see all of her hoo-haw, right? All of her glory, exposed between her legs. So the theory goes that humans developed breasts because, unlike other primates, we don\u2019t walk on our knuckles. And because we walk upright and don\u2019t make our vulvas visible, we developed ever-present breasts (as opposed to breasts that develop only during lactation) to mimic the curvaceous ass, hips and displayed vulva of our ancient ancestors. Overtime, this has developed into the favorability hourglass shape, which is easily distinguished from the masculine boxy body time.  And then there\u2019s the fact that nipple stimulation leads to an increase in the release of oxytocin. Oxytocin, also known as the love hormone, is a brain chemical that\u2019s released when babies nurse from their mothers and increases bonding between the two. But the brain doesn\u2019t distinguish between a baby and a lover, so when nipples are stimulated, regardless of by who, bonding increases. So it makes sense than, that evolution would lead men to want to stimulate women\u2019s nipples because in doing so, it would make the woman bond with the man and be less likely to get impregnated by someone else.  So to wrap this back around to the question: Why are so many men obsessed with women\u2019s breasts when it\u2019s the buttocks that hides the exciting locations? Because it\u2019s in their best interest to pay attention to a woman\u2019s breasts and increase their bonding with her\u2026. Doing so is more likely to lead to the progression of their genes. And while many men do appreciate a nice rack and theres biological reasons for it, most still prefer butts: Breasts or Buttocks: What Do Men Really Prefer?. ",

            "answer_text": "A flawless face is far less likely to catch a man's eye than a pair of proud breasts. Recently, a new study showed that 47% of men pay attention to women\u2019s breasts at first sight when communicating face-to-face with the opposite sex; secondly, nearly 1/3 of them pay attention to women\u2019s waist and buttocks first; less than 20% Of people will look at women's faces at a glance. The reasons are as follows: 1. Physical structure coordination According to research by European and American biologists, the bodies of men and women are born to cooperate with each other, and the arc formed by the stretching of the hands of the man matches the convex arc of the woman's chest. The strongest in men is the hands, while the weakest and softest place in women is the chest. Very cooperative at the physical structure level!  2. Maternal tenderness The plump breasts have a maternal tenderness, which makes men feel safe. They are eager to feel relaxed and at ease when they are in the arms of their mother when they are in the arms of the baby through contact with the chest. Most of the men's attachments to women's breasts are subconsciously attached to the baby's breastfeeding period. Every man has the experience of breastfeeding. He was deeply impressed by the scene where he touched his mother's breast while feeding. 3. Men like round things Some people say that men have a special habit of round things, such as basketball, football, billiards, etc., they all tie women's breasts! Men love women the most. The road is rough, which brings them unlimited reverie and dynamic beauty. They can't help but want to reach out and touch them. 4. According to the research of medical scientists, the place where the water is the least in men is the hands, while the place where the most water is in women is the chest. 5. According to research by estheticians, the coolest posture for a man is the moment when he is about to fight and wave his hand, while the most beautiful posture for a woman is the moment when the chest is slightly raised.  6. According to the research of writers, the hands of men are the places where women write the most inspiration, while the breasts of women are the places where men write the most inspiration. 7. According to the research of geographers, the most resilient part of a man is his hands, while the weakest or softest part of a woman is the breast. 8. According to research by kinesiologists, men often touch a woman's breasts with their hands to increase toughness, while women's breasts often touched by men can also increase moisture, which is quite good for the next generation of children to breastfeed.
