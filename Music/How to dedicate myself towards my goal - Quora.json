            "answer_text": "My first friend worked like mad, took college courses in science, participated in a science fair project, and got into Harvard as a second year student, another I knew studied every word that was learned from a novel and wrote this with the etymology and the source where he learned the word on a three by five card and kept the note cards alphabetically. He got a perfect score on the SATs supposedly. Another who I admire was a voracious reader and was poor but read newspapers like mad and he spied on an group meeting who excluded particular ethnic groups and did the story in the college newspaper at Pennsylvania State University and got into \u201cThe Philadelphia Inquirer\u201d right after college. He built his own car and raced it and did a story on it, and he sewed his own jacket, and he cared for and encouraged his siblings, and he how works at \u201cThe New York Times.\u201d How do you dedicate your life to a specific goal is a very good question. Most people have other avocations which fit into their goal like exercise and reading. But the question also is what causes this motivation. With men sometimes they fall in love and would like to impress, others want to impress their parents and often ethnic community or other community, or maybe others are heartbroken and want to impress and find as a result their newfound talent or work to be a catharsis. But the most important thing about the reason for the person working so hard is that whatever his or her motivation or drive, he or she becomes absorbed and enjoys for himself or herself that talent and work and no longer serendipitously wants to impress people so much. So what is your dream? I look forward to hearing about this, and who motivated you or why you were motivated you in the first place. ",

            "answer_text": "One way to dedicate yourself is by taking the time to invest in the goal. This is more than writing down the goal as you might write down, \u201cBuy milk,\u201d on a to-do-list. That is not a deep investment, only taking a few seconds of your time to write, \u201cI want to be healthy\u201d or \u201cI want to finish a marathon\u201d. Instead, invest the time to formally structure the goal. One way to do this is by using the S.M.A.R.T. model. Using the model requires you invest some effort in your goal, providing a structure that includes actions you need to take, how success will be measured, etc. When you dedicate some time structuring the goal, it will help you become more invested as well as provide clarity. Below is one version of the model. It is geared towards developing multiple structured goals verses some formats of S.M.A.R.T. or in some versions S.M.A.R.T.E.R., that tend to focus on a single goal. Find a version that works for you.  ",

If your goal is not clear or not specific enough to fit your goals it will make it much more difficult to accomplish those goals.Make sure it is realistic. If your goals is outlandish and unrealistic, that will also certainly hinder your chances of achieving that goal. Make sure your goal is realistic. You can surely elaborate on it or make a bigger goal later, but make sure your goal is attainable.Make sure you have what you need. So many time I make big goals that really challenge myself but I don\u2019t even have what is necessary to complete those goals. Make sure you have the tools (i.e., the money, the time, the space, etc) or whatever is necessary for you to achieve it.Make sure it is a challenge. If your goal is too small or boring chasing the goal for you will become just a boring exercise. You need to make sure you push your limits.",

As the story goes, Bruce Jenner, famed U.S. Decathlete and Olympic gold medalist, was speaking to a roomful of Olympic hopefuls. He asked the group if they had made a list of their goals, and all hands went up. This isn't surprising considering the fact that Olympians are always focused, dedicated and ambitious overachievers. Then, came Bruce's follow-up question: \u201cHow many of you have your list of goals with you right now?\u201d Only one hand went up. Of all the top athletes in that room, only Dan O'Brien carried his goals with him. So, he could always read them and stay focused on them. Not surprisingly, Dan O'Brien went on to achieve a huge goal when he won gold in the decathlon at the 1996 Olympics. In short, set goals, write it down and then carry it with you everywhere you go.

            "answer_text": "Goals are of two types. Long term and short term. Long term goal is on but short term goals are more than one. Short term goals should be realistic, specific and attainable. They should be line up based on what is the first priority. Once you know your target visualize achieving that goal. Feel it with emotion. Make vivid images. Put some sound in it. Put some color in it. make it impressionable. This turns into an experience. We are what we think. Our thinking is based on our experiences. How will we achieve when we have no experience of achievement. Visualization will create that experience. The mind will believe because it knows that the goal was attainable. So then it will become reality. Our belief systems built up with what we have been told has flaws. Use common sense. If you make a goal with all the effort you will be committed to it. If the time comes for hard work then you will do it. These are actionable things to do not talk about.

I have tried diets and exercises for the same. But did it work? No. I'm still fat. Why? Because I wasn't consistent. I would stop excercising when I felt bored or over ate at a party. So the problem was not that I didn't have a goal. It wasn't that I didn't write down the goals, but the lack of consistency. So how do you achieve your goal? By working towards it consistently.
