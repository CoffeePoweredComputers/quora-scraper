The most common solution - Use YouTube downloader to download YouTube videos and convert them to MP3 files is, how to say, risky due to the good downloaders are intermingled with the bad ones, which means they could carry spam or malware. The concern is also true of YouTube converters. So I am here to suggest you try a 3rd-party screen recorder - RecMaster to capture YouTube audios. With valid paid licenses, your benefits will be protected to the most degree. And beyond that, the screen recorder captures youtube videos effortlessly and you can choose the audio-only mode to capture YouTube music. ",

The right way is uncommon, that is to get YouTube Red, which costs money monthly, and download videos like that. The way most people do it is by simply going on your computer, searching YouTube to MP3 in Google, and using a website to convert it into the content. MP3 works if you just want audio. If you want the video screen as well, you can search YouTube to MP4, which includes video. The sites are sketchy, so make sure your computer and browser are safe before proceeding. Hope this helps.
