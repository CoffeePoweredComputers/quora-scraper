            "answer_text": "Blackpink always have some sort of diamond or rhombus formation. They also go for diagonal lines or just lines formation. Rose does well with sliding smoothly on the floor. That's sort of her move.  (as if it's your last)  (boombayah). Jennie is usually made to be carried by other members. That's her move.   Lisa is given sexy moves. Like the 'twerking' in Playing with fire and the leg split in 'Boombayah'. Jisoo is given the easiest steps. Quite unnecessary, considering that she is as very hardworking and her dancing has improved a lot. ",
