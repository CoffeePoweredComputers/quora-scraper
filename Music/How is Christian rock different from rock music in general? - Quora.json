            "answer_text": "There's so much that can be said about this... If the bands intent is to create music that either encourages Christians in a certain way, or their intent is to write positively about Christianity so that non-Christians can appreciate it more (or become Christians), then I'd say that's what makes Christian rock different. The Bible says that the gospel is the \"power of God\". So the idea for many Christians is to communicate the gospel clearly, and God will take care of applying the message to people. Like scattering seeds and seeing if they produce plants. Many Christian artists try to do that with lyrics. Basically for a lot of Christian music, the band or music is a means to an end, or a tool to communicate the gospel or other beliefs. The same can be said for artists that try to promote other civil rights in some way. The music is a tool for them to convey a message. There are obviously varying degrees of intent and quality. In my opinion, most Christian music really sucks because the artist isn't very focused on making good art, they are far too focused on intent. They just think that if the content is Christian enough, it's good. But there's a market for that kind of music unfortunately, such as people who buy all their crap from Christian book stores. Similarly, Christian movies usually suck because they are so focused on the intent, that the art, honesty, and storytelling is just terrible. If someone is a true artist (someone that creatively and honestly expresses themselves) and they happen to be Christians, to me that is the best \"Christian music\". Not all of their songs are about God because there is more to their life than just their faith. Of course faith often plays into all aspects of life, but there's still more to your life. For example, a Christian that is an artist might just sing about how pissed off they got at a friend once, or about a time a close family member died, because those are honest normal life experiences. While the next song they might sing about how glad they are that their sins are forgiven, because that's an honest experience as well. Some examples of Christians that demonstrate varying degrees of intent with their music: Lecrae - he started out as a rapper that pretty much only rapped about Jesus. His audience was only Christians, as it was basically the Christian alternative for fans of rap music. Sure it was good, but he was just preaching to the choir. As he evolved, he started rapping about normal life stuff (heartbreak, marriage, his upbringing, politics) while also rapping about Christianity positively in other songs. He's still a Christian Rapper in my opinion, but he's reaching a lot more people and not just preaching to the choir. He's turned out to be a renowned artist that makes great music, and he just happens to be a Christian. For Today - a hardcore, punk, metal band that is very talented at making good heavy music. These guys are extremely outspoken with their beliefs. They tour with non-Christian and Christian bands, because fans of this type of music typically love the music for it's heavy sound and not the lyrics as much. When they play shows to such diverse crowds, they always talk about Jesus between songs and interact with people at the festivals and small clubs they play at. You might find them praying with their Christian fans, and you might find them having peaceful debates with non-Christians. These guys are very intentional about spreading the gospel. Gungor - a rock, indie, sometimes pop artist that is led primarily by a married Christian couple. It seems about 80% of their songs are about Jesus. Sometimes their songs are just interesting stories they tell. They seem to have more of a neutral intent. While many of their songs can even be labeled as worship music, they are just writing honest songs that are personal to them. Their fan base is mostly Christians. The Fray - these guys got pretty famous. They are Christians (I think all of them are), but they don't really write songs that are about Jesus. I wouldn't label them a Christian band, though, because their intent wasn't to spread the gospel. Thrice - lead singer Dustin Kensrue is a Christian, and one other member might be. But the other two members are not Christians. They never promoted themselves as a Christian band, and although Dustin Kensrue's lyrics are very driven by his faith, their fan base is very diverse. Fans of alternative, hardcore, and punk just like them because they make great music, and because Dustin's lyrics can be applied in a lot of different ways. ",

            "answer_text": "Rock is about rebellion and rejection of the establishment. Christianity is the establishment. Conservative Christian philosophy has done a great deal of harm to the US. It does not offer anything positive to society as a whole and gives the religion a deservedly bad reputation. Evangelical Christianity is plastic and doesn\u2019t allow for the celebration of real emotion or experience. ",
