            "answer_text": "they are not. Unless they officially said it, they are straight men.shippers tend to take it too far with shipping the members with each other, some fans are actually delusional and spread false information based on no solid evidence.If they are, it\u2019s no one\u2019s buisness but their own, I\u2019m sure real fans would support it. However I don\u2019t think they would ever come out despite the support of international fans. Korea is a homophobic country.Another thing about Korea is that it\u2019s in their culture to have skinship between the same sex. Because bts are worldwide now, most i-armys just see what they do as \u2018gay\u2019. If that were true than every other kpop idol is gay.In my opinion yoongi is the only member with the possibility of being bisexual because unlike the other boys he uses \u2018someone\u2019 instead of \u2018a girl\u2019 or \u2018her\u2019 when asnwering questions about ideal type ect. Rather than that I think everyone else is straight unless stated otherwise.Just another thing, shipping is fun and was done as joke in the fandom. However now it\u2019s been taken too far. Y\u2019all please stop it\u2019s annoying to see everything being made into a ship. I personally don\u2019t believe any of the ships are \u2018real\u2019. Many shippers use matching rings as \u2018evidence\u2019. Friends can have matching promise rings it\u2019s not abnormal. Maybe if they get men\u2019s wedding rings then I\u2019ll believe it ",

            "answer_text": "Because the social norms in most countries say that men cannot wear pink, makeup, sparkles, have dyed hair, etc. BTS does all of those things. Also, your mom has probably only heard BTS sing, and it is not typical for men to have light, airy, high voices. Although these things are typically feminine, society assumes that if a man does feminine things, he is gay. However, if your mom sees BTS interact, they are very showy with skinship. Remember, being gay or LGBTQ+ is not bad. Being gay is 100% totally fine. Gay is only negative when people say the word negatively. I assumed that your mom said it in a \u201cbeing gay is bad\u201d way. However if your mom is aware that being gay is not negative, maybe it\u2019s her gaydar going off. A lot of army\u2019s think BTS is gay too! (In a good way!) ",
