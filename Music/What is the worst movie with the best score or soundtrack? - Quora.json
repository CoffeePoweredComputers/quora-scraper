            "answer_text": "SCORES The Village  This was the first of M. Night Shyamalan's movies in which his signature plot twist failed... badly. Further, it was just an awkward and stilted mess throughout. But despite all of its faults, it has a great score. James Newton Howard earned his fourth Oscar nomination for Best Original Score for the film.  Havana  This is easily among the worst films directed by Sydney Pollack. It bombed badly in the box office and holds a 24% on Rotten Tomatoes. Despite all of that, the score earned Dave Grusin Oscar, Grammy and Golden Globe nominations.  First Wives Club   A bad adaptation of Olivia Goldsmith's novel. Screenwriter Paul Rudnick himself said that the final script didn't make sense. This film holds a  39% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. But the music in the film was fantastic. Marc Shaiman got an Oscar nomination for the score. The soundtrack - which featured mostly female singers - featured great songs by Aretha Franklin, Dionne Warwick, Chantay Savage, Martha Wash, and many others. It's no surprise that the movie was later turned into a  musical, scored by the legendary Motown team of Holland-Dozier-Holland.  She Hate Me  Jazz composer Terence Blanchard has handled the score on many of Spike Lee's films. He always brings his A-Game. Unfortunately, Spike gave him nothing to work with on this movie, which is on my all-time worst list. 19% on Rotten Tomatoes. Only God Forgives   Nicolas Winding Refn reteamed with Ryan Gosling after their sleeper hit Drive to make this movie, and it was a major misfire. Also returning from Drive was composer Cliff Martinez, and he actually did a good job with the score.  View to A Kill   Yes, there are some bad James Bond films, and this is certainly one of them. But John Barry's score was solid. This also has Duran Duran's theme song \"View to a Kill,\" which reached No. 1 on the Billboard charts.  SOUNDTRACKS Batman & Robin   Almost universally panned by critics and disliked by fans, this is a truly bad film. It was nominated for eleven Razzies and won one for Worst Supporting Actress (Alicia Silverstone). Like it's predecessor, Batman Forever, director Joel Schumacher made sure to give this film a decent soundtrack. The soundtrack had radio singles from Smashing Pumpkins, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, Goo Goo Dolls, Jewel, and R. Kelly. The soundtrack album sold over one million copies. Empire Records  A lot of people from my generation really like this movie because of its rebel attitude, the cast of fresh faces who went on to big things, and its strong alternative rock soundtrack. The movie is trash. It was badly edited in post-production, and it feels like scenes are missing. It's plotless and very hard to watch. It bombed at the box office and sits at 24% on Rotten Tomatoes. Nonetheless, the soundtrack is a showcase for many of the great alternative bands of the time, like The Cranberries, Better than Ezra, Toad the West Sprocket, and Gin Blossoms.  The Bodyguard  One of the best-selling movie soundtracks of all-time is trapped in a terrible movie. This film was a box office success, despite being panned by critics and getting seven Razzie nominations. But the real magic was the music. Half of the album was Whitney Houston, and here she was in prime form. There were multiple chart topping singles from an album that sold 45 million copies. It got two Oscar nominations, both for Best Original Song. It also earned six Grammy nominations and won three trophies, including Album of the Year.   XXX: State of the Union  The original XXX was a big hit for star Vin Diesel and director Rob Cohen, but both of them left this project, and things only went downhill from there. The entire movie is bad and it underperformed at the box office, earning $71 globally on a $87 million budget. Not only does it have a 16% on Rotten Tomatoes, but it is one of the rare films to dip under a 5.0 on IMDb, currently holding a 4.3. But, like it's predecessor,  it does have a good soundtrack. The first film was alt-metal and nu-metal, this film leans more towards hip hop, including a track from lead actor Ice Cube. Some of the song are hip hop / rock hybrid tracks, which fits the nu metal trend of the early- to mid-2000s.  Blade Trinity   This movie was plagued with problems during production, most of them rumored to center on star Wesley Snipes. While easily the worst film of the trilogy, it may have had the best soundtrack, which is saying a lot since the previous films had good music. It has a nice mix of hip hop and electronica, including four songs by Wu Tang Clan members.  ",

            "answer_text": "In terms if scores, you should check out a bunch if composers. Jerry Goldsmith was perhaps the most quintessential film composer of all time, and although he scored many acclaimed films (Chinatown, Patton, Planet of the Apes, L. A. Confidential, Alien), he wrote the music for many bad movies - but the music itself was incredibly good. Remember films like King Solomon\u2019s Mines, Link, the Rambo films (I know the first one is ok, but the sequels\u2026), Legend, IQ, Mom and Dad Save the World\u2026? All have wonderful scores which are way better than the films they were composed for. Then you have the mighty Richard Band. He is best known for cult classic Re-Animator, but he has written numerous grand orchestral scores of great quality for a great number of not so good low budget features: The Pit and the Pendulum, Mutant, The House on Sorority Row, The Resurrected, Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn\u2026 and the list goes on. Almost every great film composer has written exquisite scores for bad films. Even John Williams scored Heartbeeps, James Horner wrote many superb scores for stinkers early in his career (Humanoids from the Deep, The Hand, Deadly Blessing), and then you have my own personal favourite in this odd genre: Elmer Bernstein\u2019s Slipstream - a full-bodied, gorgeous orchestral score for a terrible, terrible sci-fi movie starring Mark Hamill post-Star Wars, pre cult recognition and careee re-vamp. A must see for the music! ",

            "answer_text": "This is an unpopular opinion but the one bad movie with the best musical score that I can think of is La La Land. I know that this is inflammatory because the film is widely regarded as a modern classic however, the film and score are inseperable because of it\u2019s musical nature, though this is taken to the point of reliance. A good story holds up no matter if it is seen without sound or heard without visuals. You can look to several older musicals and see that the music may hold up the plot but they aren't mutually exclusive. La La Land has a fantastic score and it is deserving of all the praise in the world for musical genius however the plot, the real story of La La Land falls flat for me. This is no reason to degrade La La Land as a whole, I can truly appreciate it\u2019s value as a musical masterpiece but without that killer soundtrack, the story just doesn't do anything for me. ",

Rahman as the music director. The man is brilliant.  1) Slumdog Millionaire - This movie was at par with some average Bollywood flop movie in terms of quality. I wouldn't have watched it if it hadn't listened to this awesome score. \"O Saya\"    2) Rockstar : Calling this move 'poor' might not be a popular opinion, but I thought this film was...meh, at best. But I felt I got my money's worth because almost all the songs/soundtracks were really good! With the melodic 'Jo Bhi Main', chirpy \"Hawa Hawa\", romantic \"Tum ho\", \"Nadaan Parindey\"- filled with agony, the trance-inducing \"Kun Faya Kun\" to the rebellious anthem-like \"Sadda Haq\".  Sadda Haq   Nadaan Parindey   Not sure if my tastes in music align with every single person, but these soundtracks were very very well received, much more than the respective movies. Thanks for A2A!

Rahman with gems like Behne De, Khilli Re , this was a failed take on Ramayana by director Mani Ratnam. And unsurprisingly, it was a flop at the Box Office. 2.  Jhoom Barabar Jhoom :    The film is \"all gloss, no substance\" as pointed out rightly by a reviewer. The soundtrack by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy was well recieved. The melodious Bol Na Halke Halke became widely popular. Also noteworthy were the foot-tapping numbers Kiss of Love and the title track. 3.  Delhi-6 :    A decent storyline with a highly idiotic climax. The soundtrack, by A. R. Rahman, however was very refreshing. Masakkali was an instant chart-topper. Genda Phool and Rehna Tu also became quite popular. P.S. Interestingly, all the three movies have Abhishek Bachchan in the lead roles! ",

Dreadful film really that tried to present McLaren has the masterful pop svengali figure who manipulated the music business and media, while denying how good the Pistols actually were in their brief heyday. Yet the soundtrack music is quite good. There is some of the original Sex Pistols\u2019 material, and a lot else recorded by members after singer Johnny Rotten had departed. Guitarist Steve Jones oversaw the recording and production of most of it. It\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of char (to this day you won\u2019t hear a lot of Sex Pistols on the radio) but I like it. :) ",
