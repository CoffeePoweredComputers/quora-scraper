            "answer_text": "Yes and no Kpop these days is rising so fast. seems like everyone knows about Kpop now and everyone is loving these idols from Korea, China, Japan\u2026 Everywhere you go you\u2019ll find Kpop fans. you\u2019d think Kpop is at its best now, wouldn\u2019t you? well, the thing is, it's not. with so much exposure to the west, old Kpop fans like me can tell Kpop has changed, and it has changed a lot. Kpop always had a bit of a western vibe to it unlike Jpop for example. but now its slowly becoming Apop. new fans wouldn\u2019t mind or even notice because that\u2019s the reason they liked Kpop in the first place. but to older fans, Kpop lost its uniqueness. it has lost its true colors. when I listen to a new song today, I don't listen to Kpop. I listen to Apop but with Korean words. so to answer your question, no, Korean Apop is still very much alive. but yes, Kpop is about to die. R.I.P Kpop. you\u2019ll be missed. And as Ethan James likes to say Big big sad :((( ",

It literally just broke a bunch of records on streaming this week, it\u2019s advanced farther into the western mainstream than ever before with the performances last weekend, and it\u2019s still as strong on the Korean charts as it has been the last few years.
