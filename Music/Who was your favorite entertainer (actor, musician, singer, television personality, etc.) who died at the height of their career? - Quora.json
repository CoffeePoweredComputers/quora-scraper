Born: January 16, 1979, Brooklyn, New York City, NY Died: August 25, 2001, Marsh Harbour, Bahamas after they finished shooting her \u201cRock the Boat\u201d music video. She was only 22-years old.  The Princess of RnB. Aaliyah was definitely on her way to becoming a huge Hollywood star. Starring in films like Romeo Must Die and The Queen of the Damned. Upon her passing her a 'Matrix' Zee character role was given to Nona Gaye. Aaliyah had a infectious smile with a dose of tomboy albeit sexy style. She was determined and loved her craft. She had a beautiful voice and aura about her, she reminded me of myself with similar traits. I often imagine what her life would be like today. Would she be married with kids, movies she could\u2019ve starred in etc. So, was so young & beautiful and it hurts me to know that her life was cut short. Gone too soon!  Miss you, babygirl!

            "answer_text": "Jimi Hendrix choked on his own vomit while unconscious on drugs in September 1970. It\u2019s well documented that he\u2019d grown disillusioned and jaded in the last year and a half of his life. He was certainly no longer the enthusiastic, vibrant artist who was energetically discovering the breadth of his talent back in 1966 and \u201867. After just a few short years of stardom, he seemed to die at a crossroads in his life. Where would his life and career have taken him if he hadn\u2019t died at the age of 27? Sadly, we will never know for certain and any ideas about his future possibilities will remain supposition. Rock music icon Elvis Presley is usually considered to have died at a point where he was long past his prime. Prescription drugs helped him to deal with the pressures of a movie career that he grew to hate in the 1960s. They also helped him to party all night and sleep when he wanted. Medication also helped him to deal with his growing struggles with depression and insomnia during the seventies. When he passed away aged just 42, choked by an epic bout of constipation caused by the drugs which stunned his digestive tract, he was also at a pivotal point in his life. His controlling manager Colonel Tom Parker was growing progressively tired of his troublesome, ailing star and was rumoured to be considering severing ties with Elvis. A story broke in May of 1977 that Parker was looking to some West Coast investors to buy Elvis\u2019s contract from him, but the media attention seemed to make them lose interest. Parker denied the story and claimed his business partnership with Elvis was as strong as ever, but the story hadn\u2019t come from nowhere. For his part, Elvis was becoming increasing desperate to go on the world tour that Parker had always blocked. Would that tour have happened if Elvis had not collapsed on the bathroom floor in August 1977? If he had, what would that tour have been like? How would Elvis have reinvented himself and transitioned into the 1980s if he had conquered his drug habit? Like Jimi\u2019s future, we will never know for sure and can only wonder\u2026 ",
