            "answer_text": "Sometimes, Instagram can make it hard for you to promote links. This is for two reasons: You get a limited amount of areas to promote a linkInstagram doesn\u2019t want you to promote dubious on their platformNow, there are two places you can insert a direct link on Instagram: Your bioIn a Story, but only if you have over 10,000 followersThis is really your only course of action as it can be challenging to promote links on Instagram without spamming. Here are some tips for linking on Instagram: Direct Link A direct link is the actual raw link you copy and paste from the address bar. This means it\u2019s not on your website or landing page and you haven\u2019t cloaked it with a URL shortener, such as Bitly. This can lead to more clicks, but your link is out in the open and more likely to be seen and taken down by Instagram. Sometimes you can get away with this, other times you can\u2019t. It depends on how popular your Instagram account is and if Instagram can detect the link, possibly through a blacklist or user reports. Link to Website You can direct Instagram users to your website or to a page on your website. So you could be promoting a specific offer which would work better if you could direct traffic to a specific page rather than a home page. You can create Instagram posts related to this offer and in the caption or even on the image you can tell people to view the link in your bio. URL Shorteners A URL shortener can be used to hide the real URL and also shorten it to something more visually appealing. A popular URL shortening service is Bitly and there are plenty of services out there. Sometimes URL shorteners can be flagged by Instagram as spam, so you may need to stay on top of this and change your shorteners periodically. Link to a Link Page A Link Page is a web page that is specifically designed to be short, concise, and have a few links to pages that you want users to be directed to. It\u2019s essentially a Landing Page that is designed to funnel users off into different areas that they\u2019re interested in. Linktree is a popular service for this and you can add the main link to your bio which directs users to a page that contains multiple links. This strategy is great if you have multiple links that you want to be visible from a single page. ",

I have added more than 5 of my YouTube video links in my Instagram bio. You surely are thinking how I do this when Instagram only allows us to include one link in our bio? Well,m that\u2019s a trick which has helped my get lots of people and traffic for my YouTube videos. I use a service called iLink which allows me to add as many links a s I want in my bio and convert all of them into only one short link which then I share in my Instagram bio. One of the best options of iLink is that you can either include the link of your videos as a clickable button, or have the video preview itself, as a button which is both clickable and can be played. This way, you can add as many YouTube videos or links as you want and drive traffic for them through Instagram. Using iLink, you can add several links to wesbsites, products, blogs, other social media platforms, videos and even musics. easily ditch the Instagram restriction and have lots of links in an Instagram bio.

This means that you will have to copy the video into your phone gallery and then upload in IG in the normal way. However, IG is natively set to #Vertivision. (Arrrgg \u2013 HATE it!)If your YT video is in the proper Landscape mode then you will have either the edges cropped or black bars top and bottom in IG. So, make your choice and edit accordingly. Do a bit of a crop if there is room to spare on the sides. Position the video on a suitable background to make a square with something (interesting and relevant text?) in that top/bottom (both?) black space. You have seen others doing it so take them as an example. The easier way could be if YT had an IG link in the Share - but it doesn\u2019t (I wonder why?) So the next logical thought is to just copy the link in your \u201cShare\u201d on YT and put it into the IG but I am not sure if IG still allows this to happen.  However, a quick test has shown that, although the link is shown in the comments, it does not seem to be a clickable URL in the normal way \u2026  Ah well, that\u2019s IG for you \u263a ",

The tool is mostly focused on vloggers and videographers to create better content for Instagram. It converts horizontal video content into a square or vertical one. Its 1080x1920 (9:16) and 1080x1350 (4:5) output formats for vertical videos are exactly maximal and minimum video aspect ratios for IGTV.  ",
