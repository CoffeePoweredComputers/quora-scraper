            "answer_text": "Emo rap has been apart of my collection for 6 months now. What caused it to be there Well, it all started 1.5 years ago. I was doing well in school, but lost who I actually was. Around this time, I started listening to the Into the Spider-verse Soundtrack. I thought it wasn\u2019t too good. I listened to it a few more times, and found a song that helped me through the rest of the year. Hide, by Juice WRLD. This song helped me finding who I actually am, what I enjoy. Listening to this for months, then I hear about Juice\u2019s death. It shattered me. The guy that helped me through my darkest times, is now gone. I start listening to other hits of Juice\u2019s like Lucid dreams, All girls are the same etc. 4 months prior to this answer, I was given an assignment of analysing rap songs. I chose Scared Of The Dark. I did good on the assignment, got a B, but lets get back to the point. I was invested in X\u2019s part in the song. It was short, but still had so much meaning to it. I researched about him, and listened to his music, with the first being Hope. I just loved the way X is able to add so much meaning to his lyrics, and the way he uses the music to his advantage. To later on find out about his death shocked me. So now today, I listen to Juice and X My two favourite music legends  ",

That\u2019s what emo rap is supposed to be. Plus, I didn\u2019t know about one of my favorite rap rock artists, Travie McCoy, I never knew that he\u2019s emo rap, too. ",

I wasn\u2019t really excited and I didn\u2019t think I would like it. I was curious though. After hearing a couple songs I found myself liking it. Then I listened to XXX Tentacion. Damn. That made me start listening to it more often. RIP XXX. ",

            "answer_text": "Emo rap\u2026 Its relatable to everyone who has gone through depression and me dealing with that and self-harm it makes it even more relateable to those who have heartbreak or had a hard life in general, I was going through a hard time when I discovered xxxtentacion it was a very sad year my mother and father split up and I needed guidance I listened to some of his songs then looked at his interveiws and realized that he had been through a lot of the same things as us\u2026 he was a person and did not have a \u201cgangstar\" persona then I also to Juice WRLD, Trippie Redd, Lil Peep etc. Short answer: It is relatable to everyone who has been through something like depression or been through some type of struggle.

I took park in the whole emo-fashion style, and therefore we all listened to that style of music. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I genuinely enjoyed it at the time, but have now moved on and found a genre I prefer on my own. I still listen to some songs and enjoy them, more because they\u2019re linked to good memories at the time. ",
