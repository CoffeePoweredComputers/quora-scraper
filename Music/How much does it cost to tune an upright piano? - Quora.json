            "answer_text": "It depends on your location, as well as the last time the piano was tuned. Your local market will depend on several factors. First, the number of Piano Technicians in your area. For instance, in New York City while the cost of living is high, many technician are charging less then they are in other areas. Definitely less then one would think considering the price of rent etc. Part of this is due to a large number of them. Competition drives the price down. Now if you live in an area with maybe only 2 or 3 piano tuners\u2026. well they have more leeway to charge more. Another factor is when it was tuned. If you tune it once or twice a year then generally all you need is a basic tuning. Usually I have found the price ranges between 100-200 depending on the area. However, if you wait over 2 years you might need what is referred to as a pitch raise. Some call it a double tuning or an extra pass. It basically involves the technician going over your piano twice. The first time is a rough quicker pass. The tech will most likely raise it above pitch. When finished the piano will have dropped back close to pitch. Then the tech will do the final pass or fine tuning. This will cost extra. It is not uncommon for a piano that has been neglected for 10 plus years to need multiple passes and several visits to bring it up to pitch. This prevents the piano from being unstable and the danger of breaking strings if you raise it up to quickly or aggressively. This will result in paying more. It is not uncommon to pay $250-$400 to bring a piano up to pitch if it involves multiple visits and the piano hasn't been tuned in over a decade and/or been moved as well. So sometimes that old \u201cfree\u201d piano becomes a little more expensive after moving and tuning costs. I recommend calling around and checking prices of at least 4 piano technicians. Don't necessarily go with the cheapest. Also make sure they work on pianos as there business,not a part time tuner. Since there livelihood depends on there reputation they are more likely to do a good job and if anything is unsatisfactory, work with you to fix it. ",

            "answer_text": "The cost can vary widely from one region to another, and from one technician to another. I would imagine tuning fees in Silicon Valley are probably higher than the national average. Just keep in mind that some technicians charge more than others for a reason, and shopping for the lowest price is not always in the best interest of the piano. If you owned a high end sports car, you would probably do some research before choosing a shop to work on it. But even people with less expensive cars want quality work done by reputable mechanics who know what they are doing and won't charge you for poorly done or unnecessary repairs. The same should be true for piano owners. My advice is to go to the PTG website (Piano Technicians Guild) and use the search at the upper right corner for a Registered Piano Technician near your zip code. Call a few technicians in your area, ask some questions, find out what they do and what they charge, and make a decision based on how you feel after talking with a few technicians.
