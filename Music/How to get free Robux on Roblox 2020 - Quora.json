            "answer_text": "Well, technically speaking, nothing is trully \u2018free\u2019 - you\u2019ll either have to work, or pay for it. Now, I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019re just talking about getting robux without having to steal your mom\u2019s credit card, so I may suggest some options for you. 1 - Working for a roblox user/group : This one is pretty self-explanatory. You can start learning a skill like making gfx, building, writting, scripting, etc - anything you like! You can even invent new jobs if you\u2019re creative! Once you\u2019ve mastered the skill on a specific level, you can start searching around roblox games, groups, discord or youtube for groups or people that are hiring developers and if you\u2019re lucky, the people you\u2019re working for may pay you robux. Now, I may have to remind you that this could be against the TOS, but I haven\u2019t seen anyone getting severely punished nor warned yet so it should be fine. Also, watch out for scammers! Always make the person pay half of your price first, or they may just take your hard work and disappear. I learned this the hard way. 2 - Work on your own game! : Recently, roblox has made a feature that helps devs and encourage them to make games. As far as I remember, it works like this - Whenever you create a game in roblox studio and publish it, roblox will keep track on the game\u2019s satistics (sorry if I\u2019m spelling that wrong) - Including how long players have been playing that game. And the special part about this is you will get paid if the player spends a reasonable amount of time in the game, but don\u2019t think about fooling the system tho, it will only count if the person who\u2019s playing your game has Premium. So, if you can, try to make your game as interesting as possible, and gives benefits to Premium players. Who knows, maybe your game will even get on the front page and gets thousands of visitors a day if you\u2019re lucky! Also, gamepasses can be useful too since they are free to create! 3 - Free Robux Sites and Groups : Alright listen to me first, it isn\u2019t that easy, but there *may* be real robux groups out there. For most of the time, when you hear of free robux you\u2019d probably imagine some sketchy badly designed sites which require you to download stuff (I mean honestly I can\u2019t blame you, 99% of free robux sites/groups are like that anyways), but that isn\u2019t always the case. Personally you can search around for those groups, but it would probably be a tedious and boring journey which for most of the time would lead you to nowhere, but if you can, try going for popular sites that were confirmed to be safe, search for the infos of people who claimed that the site works, etc. My brother was lucky and got robux from a site that he said was confirmed by his favourite youtuber (I\u2019m not going to mention what it was tho since I\u2019m not 100% sure about whether the website is safe or not and I don\u2019t advertise for people). Remember not to download any suspicious stuff or enter your private infos tho. -All I have for now. Remember those are just from my personal experience.- ",

Group funds, on the other hand, are when a Roblox group has Robux in it to give their members from the group Robux. I hope that helped! :) ",
