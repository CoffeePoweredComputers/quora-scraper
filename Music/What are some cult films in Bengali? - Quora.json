            "answer_text": "There are many path-breaking Bengali movies made in its journey of 100 years. So, \u201csome\u201d cannot be cited really, as there would be really many. While I may mention some, I may miss some. Being born in the \u201990s, I have witnessed at least 30 years of Bengali cinema \u201clive\u201d. But, as a devotee of cinema, I have seen many old Bengali movies, made decades before I was born. Here is a list: Pather Panchali (1955)- I guess, this is a cult cinema in the world and till today sells the prestige of India Cinema to the world. Released in 1955, it is still the textbook for film students and a charming topic of discussion among cinephiles. Every shot of the movie was a benchmark. Aparajito (1956) - The 2nd from the Apu Trilogy is definitely one coming of age cinema. The world of Apu is still a fascinating experience to watch on screen. Apur Songsar (1959) - The last of the Apu Trilogy brought the famous Soumitro-Sharmila pair on screen. It was sheer magic to see Apu unfold! Ajantrik (1958) - Directed by Ritwik Ghatak, this was perhaps India\u2019s first movie made around an inanimate object. It depicted the story of a taxi driver to whom his taxi is everything! Meghe Dhaka Tara (1960) - Directed by the great Ritwik Ghatak, this movie was \u201ceveryone\u2019s story\u201d. Komal Gandhar (1961) - Another from Ritwik Ghatak, this one told the story of a couple during the partition days. Abhijan (1962) - Another gem from the universe of Ray that will stay with you forever. Nayak (1966) - This one is one of my all-time favorite among all Ray movies. The overnight journey from Howrah to Delhi in Rajdhani Express turns out to be life changing for Aditi & Arindam. Uttam Kumar & Sharmila Tagore were spectacular and yes, there was a similar scene from Wild Strawberries too! Subarnarekha (1965) - This one from Ritwik Ghatak is ranked among those greatest movies of all time. It also dealt with a partition story of 3 people. Gupi Gayne Bagha Bayne (1969) - Not only this but all franchise movies of Gupi-Bagha are amazing. Touted to be children movies, these are way more than just being tagged \u201cchild movie\u201d. Two \u201cnot so talented\u201d, \u201cunconventional\u201d, \u201cweird\u201d, \u201cstupid\u201d people from the different village are thrown out and suddenly they meet the \u201cBhooter Raja\u201d or \u201cking of ghosts\u201d who blesses them with three superpowers. And now, they roam around with those powers, meet various people, solves problems, etc. Paar (1984) Paroma (1985) 36 Chowringhee Lane (1987) Bagh Bahadur (1989) Unishe April (1994) Dohon (1997) Utshob (2000) Bariwali (2000) Paromitar Ekdin (2000) Mr. & Mrs. Iyer (2002) Titli (2002) The Last Lear (2007) Kaalpurush (2008) Antaheen (2009) The Japanese Wife (2010) Just Another Love Story (2010) Abohoman (2010) Autograph (2010) Moner Manush (2010) Aami Aadu (2011) Baishe Shrabon (2011) Bhooter Bhabishyat (2012) Goynar Baksho (2013) Apur Panchali (2013) Chotushkone (2014) Jaatishwar (2014) Belasheshey (2015) Kadambari (2015) Praktan (2016) Cinemawala (2016) Samantaral (2017) Uma (2018) Nagarirtan (2019) Shah Jahan Regency (2019) ",
