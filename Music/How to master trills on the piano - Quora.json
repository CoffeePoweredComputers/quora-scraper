            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t relax. If you relax you\u2019ll fall off the piano. You do have to \u201crelax\u201d but not the muscles you think. Trills don\u2019t come from the fingers. They come from the elbow. The pronator and supinator muscles to be exact. Play an octave and tremolo it BUT from the elbow. Now close into a two note trill. If you get tension or it is uneven, you are still trying to play with your fingers. Go back to the octave for now. Make sure that it is gravity or the weight of the arm that is playing the notes. Better yet, try to play to the point of sound. Now, every trill is different based upon what the two notes are. Sometimes you have to raise the forearm, or use your tricep to \u201cforward shift\u201d your fingers into the keys. Sometimes you have to walk in and out with the arm. Whenever you strike a note in the same place, you will develop tension. Your arm has to be in constant motion which, is the opposite of relax. Ignore exercise books. There is only proper movement. Sure, you can beat the movement into your hand but will eventually develop cramps and RSI. Run away from any teacher who tells you to practice more. Practice doesn\u2019t make perfect. Perfect practice makes perfect and once you proper muscles are in your muscle memory, it will always be there and you\u2019ll never have to practice it again. Gravity requires no practice. ",

            "answer_text": "Ensure your piano has been properly regulated, otherwise any trill practise will be wasted. 1- determine what notes are to be played 2 - trial different fingerings until a few suitable choices are found 3 - practise the fingerings at low speed with relaxed and well position hands, Ideally with curved fingers, fingertips in contact with the ivory/plastic 4- very gradually increase speed of execution, whilst maintaining control, listening and demanding evenness of touch along with clarity of precision. 5 - challenge yourself by varying speeds of trill performance - subtle variations in how you think of trilling : Is it a race for highest possible note repetition ? Is it an intended decoration of the composers idea? Is it a test of your fingers dexterity ? Avoid: Any unnecessary tension in the shoulders, arm, wrist, palm or fingers during any keyboard playing and most especially during trilling. Tension kills trills Feel free to experiment with every aspect of trill performance. Enjoy discovering your talent. Let me know how you ptogress !! ",
