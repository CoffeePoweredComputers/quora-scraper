            "answer_text": "Well, I'm only a college student, but I'll try to answer your question because no one has attempted to yet.  There are three reasons that come to mind that might be the answer your question. 1) Spotify Wants More Premium Users Spotify has been offering great incentives to purchase premium memberships over the last year. They offer student discounts and have been offering a 99 cent for three months deal for the past few months. Three months of on-the-spot music for the price of a one song on iTunes? That's something other streamers haven't been able to beat.  2) The More Ads, The More Likely You'll Buy Prem Whenever I heard those ads on Pandora or Spotify Free, I would want to close the app and find another service. I didn't, because my only other options for the songs I wanted were either expensive iTunes songs or torrenting. So I paid 99 cents and got rid of that annoying ad. Now that 99 cents turned into $6 a month and my mind is still convinced that it's an extremely cheap service. (That last part is thanks to effective marketing.) After that first month, you're hooked. They want to see how frequently the ads effect their users' decisions. 3) Spotify's Losing Money Spotify's revenue is going up (over 1B), but its profit is below zero. Last I heard they had not reached the optimal amount of premium users to start making money. With their 45 million monthly free users, ads help pay some of the bills and more of them may push free users to start paying. They're going to increase frequency until it starts to hurt them. Right now, it's not.  Those are the reasons that come to mind.

They'll stop adding ads when it appears it hurts overall revenue.  :) ",
