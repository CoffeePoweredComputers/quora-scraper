            "answer_text": "There is no best, but here's a few that are my personal contenders: Nas (feat A.Z.) - Life's A Bitch [1994]Nas, one of the all-time greats, is outshined by what has to be one of the deepest and most powerful guest verses on a track from A.Z. I could pick any track off Illmatic, but I particularly love this one for it's poignant regret, not often explored so tenderly in hip-hop. The trumpet solo that fades it out is like a sad memory passing through your mind.  Mos Def (feat. Busta Rhymes) - Do It Now [1999]Classic boast/battle rap from two of the greatest in the game. Busta and Mos have a chemistry that is off the charts and are backed up by one of my all-time favourite beats that gets dat booty movin'. Aggressive but ultimately good natured. Intelligent but also heaps of fun. Has it all.  Leaders Of The New School - A Case of the P.T.A [1990]Just some classic Golden Age trio hip-hop. We get to hear an early Busta Rhymes, but his partner Charlie Brown steals the show with a brilliantly quirky rap. I love his weird Yogi Bear-esque rising inflection and strange yelps. Great vibes and brilliant flow all around.  Snoop Doggy Dogg - Gin and Juice [1993]Just my favourite part-rap track. A perfect G-funk production, an amazing chorus and everything loveable about Snoop in one perfect package. SMOKIN INDO.  Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five - The Message [1982]One of the undisputed classics, and my favourite of hip-hop's early masterpieces. The beat is one of the greatest laid to tape and the lyrics, while simple by today's standards, are a brillinat document of social realist art. Confronting and timeless.  Honorable mentions:Outkast - Ms Jackson [2000]Funky Four Plus One - That's The Joint [1981]The Sugarhill Gang - Rapper's Delight [1979]The Roots - The Seed (2.0) [2002]Organized Konfusion - Prisoners of War [1991] ",

            "answer_text": "Acknowledging that this is a foolhardy exercise, here are my top contenders: Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five: \"The Message\"If there's an obvious answer to this question, \"The Message\" is probably it. One of the all-time great beats, and a pivotal track for hip hop in general, opening the door for more serious themes.  Audio Two: \"Top Billin'\"Now this is the first track I thought of when I read the question. As a track, it's very basic: there's that unforgettable beat, then there's some truly astonishing riding of that beat by MC Milk Dee. Still, in some ineffable gut-level way, it feels like a kind of hip hop Rosetta Stone: everything you need to know about hip hop can be divined herein.  Pete Rock & C. L. Smooth: \"They Reminisce Over You\"This, too, pretty much sums up the best parts of hip hop for me. It's bittersweet, upbeat, and wonderfully human -- it's kind of like an Irish wake in rap form, really, just celebrating the life and times of their deceased friend, reflecting on where they came from, and so on. Vivid image after vivid image, and Pete Rock's production here is peak-of-the-form-type stuff.  The Notorious B.I.G.: \"Juicy\"The definitive rapper rags-to-riches tale. Also, possibly the most likable hip hop track of all time. I mean, c'mon: \"Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis / When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this.\" That's amazing.  There are obviously tons of other great tracks that could be mentioned here (BDP's \"My Philosophy\", Big Daddy Kane's \"Ain't No Half-Steppin'\", Geto Boys' \"Mind Playin' Tricks on Me\", Public Enemy's \"Fight the Power\", Funky 4 + 1's \"That's the Joint\", Wu-Tang Clan's \"C.R.E.A.M.\", and on and on), but these are the four I would consider indisputable.
