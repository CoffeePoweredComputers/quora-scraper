            "answer_text": "WOW, they probably didn't intend to as a child; I certainly didn't. However in my childhood home everything revolved around music. Actually everything revolved around the piano for me and there are plenty of photos at 18 months sitting in front of a childs piano and then at 2 1/2 my legs are dangling off the bench in front of a grand. My mom was a mezzo soprano graduate of Eastman School of Music. She always loved everything that I did with music; love the mom. She always encouraged me to improvise eternally and compose which I continue to do. I was fortunate to be accepted at Eastman School of Music at a young age but I was one of those peculiar students who didn't put 1000 hours a week in practice. My teacher was phenomenal and I cannot tell you how important it is to have a brilliant teacher who loves training you . I mean you are bending the strings of the piano as if it is clay . You stretch the sound with your hands . You must be able to hear this and you must be able to demonstrate it physically . Although you are physically playing the piano the experience is metaphysical . Of course there's tremendous training as well as practice but pretty much you either hear it or you don't . My son is the same way but with classical guitar and he and I speak often about how different our language is compared to non-musicians. I mean you really develop a completely different language when you breathe music; when your whole life is music and everything else is just the other stuff. I am dictating this into my phone so please forgive the run-ons. I would never push a child to try to become a concert pianist and obviously it would be the parents doing the pushing. Directing the child as their musical gift unfolds as well as finding a phenomenal teacher would be much more beneficial then setting a goal of becoming a concert pianist. A lot of decent musicians can practice to the point of sounding like a robot and never making mistake. That is not a concert pianist at least not in my book. I'd rather have a mistake and a performance that is Artful then a perfect Robotnik expression of yikes which brings me to the topic of speed. That's another either you have it or you don't. It is what it is. I know people that are phenomenally fast and phenomenally interpretive and then I know wicked fast pianists who sound like robots. Trust me the one who's Artful is better. So let's see how do you become a concert pianist? I wish I could answer that question. ",

            "answer_text": "You have to practice a lot when you are a kid. After a certain age, you can certainly learn repertory (new pieces), but your basic technique will not improve too much. Then, you have to feel great on stage. not just tolerate it or fighting against stage fright, no no no. You have to love it. I love it! I love being in the centre, being heard to! And I can love it because I practiced a lot of hours for that 75 minutes. If not, I would suffer. Third, you have to develop other skills that you will seldom be told about. For instance, how to deal with rejection, with issues on stage and outside stage, how to negotiate fees, to make a deal, to be a business(wo)man. It helps to be consistent with your repertory, for instance, usually pianists concentrate on one kind of repertory. Say Classics (Mozart), say Romantic (Chopin), say contemporary (Ligeti), say extreme avantgarde (Stockhausen), say mild avantgarde (Cage). Or of course, jazz, tango, other Latin genres. Seldom you can play well everything. You ask about a concert pianist, not a hobby/weddings pianist or a semi-professional pianist or even a piano teacher. These are very diferent things. Think of the whole thing as in sport. You can do any sport for yourself and be very good. But if you head for competitive sport, the attitude is very different. Usually you want to win and be the best you can. And you earn your money of that activity, at least in part. And you want to do it (is neither a hell nor an external obbligation). Constantly. Obsessively. Your whole brain is filled with your wish. You sleep with the piano. You do not doubt. And possibly the most important: You focus on the piano. The rest vanishes. As when you are playing Wimbledon. All that exists is that ball. And you love it. Juan Maria Solare ",
