            "answer_text": "Sounding is the term used to describe methods of finding the depth of water under a vessel, originally done with a weighted line with knots every fathom - 6 feet or two metres roughly, but modern sounding is done with pulses of high frequency \u201csound\u201d too high to hear, but the echo bounces back from the sea-bed to the receiver, and the time taken from send to the return gives the depth of the water. Most types of echo sounder can pick up fish shoals, but can also give some indication of the type of material in the seabed under the boat, which is useful information when anchoring. Rocks will give a hard clear echo, whereas mud will give a diffuse echo. Displays can be a screen, with time capture which helps identify undersea topgraphy, or a strobe light on a rotating scale, the light flashing at the point corresponding to the depth.  Sonar is like radar, using sound waves instead of radio, but again, detecting any echoes from other vessels including submarines. It uses much higher power, and has been identified as being not very good round marine mammals like whales and dolphins which also use sonar to detect fish shoals, and to navigate. The sonar pulses tend to be in a sort of cone shape rotating, to give a good coverage of the area, rather than a narrow beam, like a broad torchlight of sound. Like the echo sounder, the display will give range and perhaps depth of the object. ",
