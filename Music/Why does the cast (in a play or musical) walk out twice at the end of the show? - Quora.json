            "answer_text": "Because audiences do it out of habit. They no longer understand what the second appearance, termed the curtain call, is meant for. Audiences used to be more discriminating. When a performance was extraordinary, they would clap literally for minutes at its conclusion.  Then, and only then, the cast would come out one more time. Audiences were also less polite, and they would be known to boo loudly during performances. Now audiences will clap for anything. Average performances get the encore after only a brief moment. Good performances have been severely devalued and audiences cannot seem to distinguish among poor, average, and excellent performances. ",
