            "answer_text": "Check out her official site, but you\u2019ve gotta be 14 or older \u2192 Request Tickets - Available Dates. However. getting tickets doesn\u2019t guarantee you\u2019ll actually meet her; you\u2019ll just be in the same room as her. But now I\u2019m going to tell you the true story of how my friend met Ellen. It was my friend\u2019s first time visiting Los Angeles, so she wore an extremely nice outfit (all Burberry) and was with her equally well-dressed cousin. I guess they stood out from the rest of the tourists and a production person came up to them and said, \u201cAre you here to see Ellen?\u201d Well, yes they were, so of course they replied yes. She led them inside the studio, away from the rest of the other studio audience members. At this point, they figured something was up, but just went with it. She dropped them off in the green room, where there were snacks and beverages. My friend, who\u2019s a nurse, didn\u2019t even know what green room meant and thought they were picked to be in a game. Maybe 15\u201320 minutes later, the staff member came back with\u2026Ellen DeGeneres. TLDR \u2192 Get tickets to be in her studio audience, dress super nice, get mistaken for a VIP guest and be personally introduced to Ellen in the green room. ",

            "answer_text": "There are several ways. 1. Go see her show. 2. Find out where she parks her car when she does the show and go to that spot and wait. 3. Write her a letter saying you are very sick and one of your dreams is to meet her. 4. Find out where she lives and go knock on her door and say you are lost and need to use the telephone. But you have to be convincing. 5. Find out where she eats, has a drink, gets her hair cut or her nails done, and go there and wait for her. 6. Contact her agent or manager and say you are with a well known magazine and want to interview her for the cover. Tell them it\u2019s a gay oriented one. Go to a secret database I can\u2019t tell you about, and you\u2019ll find her address and phone number in it. Then call her and get her to answer and make up some story. \u201cHi Ellen, it\u2019s me, Nancy Cohen, I\u2019m calling to say hello. How are you!? Let her talk. She should sort of think she knows you, but you have to make her believe it. They meet a ton of people and she\u2019ll hear the name and her mind will say, \u201cOH\u201d\u2026 then she\u2019ll play along with you and will think she knows you. When you think she is sufficiently knowing you, ask if you can come for a visit, is she still at her Bel Air house or the one in Santa Barbara. Good luck ",
