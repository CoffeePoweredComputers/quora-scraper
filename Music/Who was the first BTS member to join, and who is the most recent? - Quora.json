            "answer_text": "the first confirmed bts member was RM and the last one being jimin. the order goes RMSugaJ-HopeJinJungkookVJiminRM had auditioned for Big Hit after being an underground rapper and got accepted ! actually RM was supposed to be in another group but i guess Bang PD Nim changed his mind Suga had won 2nd place in a rap battle audition for Big Hit called HitIt! He had been an underground rapper too before he auditioned. However, the reason why he joined was because Bang PD Nim had promised him that he would be in a group that did not required dancing but i guess he got scammed\u2026 (but suga is an amazing dancer) J-Hope had actually auditioned for JYP through dance with his dance group \u2018neutron\u2019 but was cut off after a few rounds during the audition. he eventually auditioned for Big Hit through dance, where he learnt how to rap under the guidance of rm and suga Jin had previously been scouted by SM but he had ignored it thinking it was a scam. then a Big Hit staff saw him come of the bus and they were attracted by his worldwide handsome face so the staff convinced him to audition for Big Hit. however jin was an acting major and couldn\u2019t sing or dance when he became a trainee. so jin has worked very hard to be where he is now and honestly it\u2019s amazing how much he has improved Jungkook had auditioned for season 3 of Superstar K and although he didn\u2019t make it pass the auditions, 7 talent agencies saw his potential and scouted him. after seeing RM rap, Jungkook thought that he was really cool, and was determined to be in and train in the same company as RM, hence he joined Big Hit V had originally went to the auditions to support his friend, but after the Big Hit staff convinced him to audition too, he called his dad and his dad agreed so he auditioned. V also had a passion for music at that time. in the end, V was the only one from his auditions who managed to pass the auditions. however, V was the last member to be revealed even though he had joined 2nd last Jimin auditioned at Big Hit after his dance teacher convinced him to do so. Jimin had been majoring in contemporary dance at that time, and was a natural dancer. with his amazing contemporary dance skills, Jimin managed to secure a place in Big Hit. however, he was nearly kicked out of Big Hit because of his dance style, as it is rather hard for contemporary dancers to transition to hip hop, the style bts does, but he managed to pull through in the end. i hope this helped !

            "answer_text": "Kim Namjoon (a.k.a. RM) was the first member of BTS. He's also the Leader/President of the group. He's a \u201cmiddle man\" of sorts and represents the group's interests, concerns and feelings to BigHit and visa versa. He's the only member who speaks English fluently (although the other members are trying their best to learn as well. He is also my Ultimate Bias and, in my opinion, the most underappreciated member of the group. He\u2019s 26 (considered 27 in \u201cKorean years\" because everyone automatically turns a year older on January 1st). He has an IQ of 148, he's heart-stoppingly handsome and is widely known as the \u201cGod of Destruction\u201d because he breaks literally everything he touches. He's a world-class klutz and I think that makes me love him even more. My perception of him is that he is a very introspective, mature young man with a huge heart. His public persona is \u201cRM\" (which formerly stood for \u201cRap Monster\", but was changed a year or two ago). Namjoon says that RM can stand for whatever we want it to. But his example was \u201cReal Me\". He has to live up to a LOT of expectations both as an idol AND a leader. But you could never tell from the outside. He's so strong and so smart and I respect the hell out of him for that. He's usually very calm, but he has his silly/hyperactive moments like anyone else would. Behind the beautiful, stoic \u201cleader\" mask he wears, I suspect there's a loooooot of pain and anxiety that he keeps buried. But those of us who also suffer from anxiety or depression usually know the signs and aren't fooled quite so easily. Kim Namjoon is a hopeless romantic from head-to-toe and that is glaringly obvious from the love and emotion he puts into the lyrics he writes (which is the majority of BTS's music, btw). This man is just\u2026. Gah. He is everything. If you don't already stan him as an ARMY, please reconsider your decision. If you're not an ARMY, feel free to ignore my little ramble about my imaginary husband.\ud83d\udc9c  Although he LOVES to argue this point, Kim Seokjin (a.k.a. Jin, a.k.a. \u201cWorldwide Handsome\") was the last to join BTS. He originally wanted to pursue an acting career, but he he had a very specific look that BigHit wanted to include in their line-up. Jin agreed and the rest is history. He's 28 years old (almost 30 in \u201cKorean years\") and he is the \u201cmain visual\u201d of the group. He's most well known for his truly stunning looks, but he's SO much more than that. In their earlier days, Jin used to do the majority of the cooking and cleaning around their dorm for the other members. Because of this fact, many ARMYs fondly refer to him as \u201cNamjoon's wife\" or \u201cEomma Jin\". They also call him that because of his sweet, nurturing personality. Although he's outright expressed that he very much dislikes being referred to with female pronouns and I agree with that 100% personally. Being a kind and giving person is not an exclusively \u201cfemale trait\u201d nor is it an exclusively \u201cmale trait\". It's a Jin trait and that should be appreciated on its' own merits. He's the eldest \u201cbrother\u201d of the group and carries alot of responsibilities on those broad shoulders of his. The other boys come to him with their troubles quite often and lean on him for moral/emotional support when they're feeling uncertain or upset. Jin's persona is very much of the \u201chappy older brother who can still act silly and young\", but he's told us that much of his \u201cgoofy\" personality is an act he puts on for our benefit and to boost the other boys' spirits. He can get depressed quite easily (no shock there) under the weight of all the pressure he deals with as \u201cthe face of the group\u201d. Jin is also well-known for his \u201cwindshield wiper laugh\". It's a quirky, squeaky sound he makes when he laughs that really does sound like windshield wipers. It's a very endearing characteristic that most ARMYs love. My perception of him is that he is a very gentle soul despite his le-Jin-dary \u201ctemper tantrums\u201d. He gets mad and pops off on the boys every so often, but I don't believe that he would ever, ever hurt anyone on purpose. He's going off to start his mandatory military service later this year and I already miss him. \ud83d\udc9c  ",
