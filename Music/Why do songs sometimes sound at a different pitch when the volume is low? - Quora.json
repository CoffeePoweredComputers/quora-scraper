I have noticed this phenomenon as well, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be a lot of good information out there about it. So is it psychosomatic, or is it an actual physical process? My pet theory is that what you\u2019re experiencing is likely your tympanic membrane being tensioned, and concurrently the air pressure in your inner ear changing slightly, as your ears undergo the acoustic reflex. The changing pressure causes the speed of sound in the area between your eardrum and your inner ear to change, and you experience this as a change in pitch. If there are any audiologists out there I\u2019d be very interested in your input as well. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Could it be that you are confusing pitch with tone? Volume and presence are similar things.. one is reactive to gain (volume) the other reactive to peak projection (presence) but basically do very similar things. Effects of low volume are: change in presence, compression of certain frequency bands, loss of other frequencies. Pitch is the motion of sound within the frequency that air vibrates to create a resonation. not 100% sure what you mean.. if you mean it reduces presence yes slightly via compression and loss. ",
