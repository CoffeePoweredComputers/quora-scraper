Notable exceptions include \u201cIf I Were a Boy\u201d (from Sasha Fierce) and \u201cKitty Kat\u201d (from B\u2019Day). Also, I\u2019m assuming that (of the Songs that she do write) she only writes the lyrics and vocal melodies for those songs, as I haven't heard or seen anything about her \u201cmaking beats\u201d (Hip-Hop/Pop music term for somebody who puts instrumentals together) or play any instruments, in spite of her also being credited as a \u201crecord producer\u201d (meaning supervisor over the sound recording) on the majority of her projects.
