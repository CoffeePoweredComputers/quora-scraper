            "answer_text": "I would say that they\u2019re more fool proof. Almost all active pickups are underwound compared to their passive counterparts. Relying on a preamp instead of windings is pretty beneficial when it comes to reducing noise from the pickup. Of course if you use a high quality power conditioner, ground loop hum reducing equipment then passive pickups can be equally quiet as an active pickup but with active pickups you don\u2019t need to rely on such high end equipments. They have minimal string pull. Strum the string on a guitar with active pickup and then do the same on a similar guitar with passive pickup, you\u2019ll notice that the one with active pickups sustain longer. It\u2019s because the magnets on active pickups are way weaker than those used in a passive pickup. Even a low output PAF passive pickup has more powerful magnet than an active pickup. Due to weaker magnets they aren\u2019t as prone to feedback as passive humbuckers. The eliminate any chance of magnetic feedback when you\u2019re close to an amp. In simple words they make you sound tight and professional by minimising variables. Often they can be way more hifi sounding than passive pickups. There are active pickups out there like the Cycfi XR that have a full frequency range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz and reference grade flat frequency curve. You can modify their frequency curve and EQ to your liking by modellers or via series of EQs and filters. It accomplishes it by using extremely low impedance pickups combined with a completely neutral preamp section. One can\u2019t achieve such a feat with passive pickups, there are limitations to the passive pickup design which won\u2019t let you do so. As for the lack of cleans on active pickups. That\u2019s a pretty generalised statement. Not every active pickup is the same. The new EMG Super 77 and Fat 55 pickups have cleans like Seymour Duncan JB and Custom. The Fishman Fluence Modern humbuckers have cleans like a medium output passive pickup, and their Open Core Classic humbuckers have vintage PAF type cleans. The Cycfi XR pickups on other hand have extremely hifi acoustic guitar like cleans. The problem with most people is whenever they hear the term \u201cactive pickups\u201d the only ones they think of is pickups like EMG 81/85, Seymour Duncan Blackouts which don\u2019t have usable cleans, but just because those active pickups can\u2019t do the cleans doesn\u2019t mean all active pickups have unusable cleans.

            "answer_text": "Since what they are at the core is a relatively weak magnet pickup with a on-board pre-amp, you get a tone that is much more consistent from guitar to guitar assuming things like the amplifier, strings, tuning and scale aren\u2019t changed too much. Also inherent to their design is a bit of compression and noise gate/clipping effect. When you play a note, generally it will come out with a little more consistent volume. This is great for distorted tones in general but not so great for cleaner tones when the nuance of your playing style may not make it past the active pickup\u2019s circuitry. Another side benefit of the weaker magnets/noise gate/clipping nature of the circuitry is that at higher volumes and gain levels your guitar will tend to feedback slightly less. When I was gigging early on, I would buy decent guitars, $400\u2013500, and swap EMGs into them immediately. The sound was definitely good enough for live shows and my tones at that time were so distorted that it was a good pairing. Honestly, if you play metal and just want a full consistent roar from your guitar, go with actives. I personally got tired of the sound and now run quality passives in all my guitars except for my 8 string where I need all the help I can get. ",
