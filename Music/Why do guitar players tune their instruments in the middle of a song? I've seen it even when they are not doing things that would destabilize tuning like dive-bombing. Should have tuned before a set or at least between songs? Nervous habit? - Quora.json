            "answer_text": "The experienced guitar players tune the guitar because the need to be tuned although you may perhaps find one or two with a nervous habit? Also, it is good practice to quickly check your tuning for good measures. Now, keep in mind that tuning your guitar on stage should never - if at all possible interfere with the flow of the performance. While an out of tune guitar is just awful, watching someone forgetting the audience while tuning the guitar is worse. Even word, not muting the sound while tuning.. If you see a good band where anyone is tuning up or checking the tuning, it is done while someone else is introducing the song, or there\u2019s a short break in the song where you have the short time need to readjust or check. It rarely takes less than a few seconds any way. Some guitars are more prone to go out of tune than others and experienced players know this and takes steps to avoid it as much as possible. Many Gibson style guitar are notorious for going out of tune unless they have been properly set-up and you use nut slot lubricants and other methods to keep the guitar top notch. You will find that proper preparations, like locking tuners, good maintenance, new but stretched and properly installed strings etc. will alleviate much of the issue. Even so, guitars will go out of tune, simply because of the temperature differences. I have played in many conditions - like on outdoor gigs where there\u2019s a massive drop or rise in temperature and no preparations or well-adjusted guitars in the world can make your instruments stay in tune - you will need to adjust! You see pro bands with guitar techs some times swap guitars. This is one reason for it. The guitar tech hands a new guitar to the player and tune the one that comes off stage. Some bands may go through a number of guitar changes through a show of 1,5 to 2 hours. If you don\u2019t have a guitar tech - like the vast majority of us - you keep at least one spare guitar at hand and you make sure to check and tune whenever there\u2019s a chance. If you see a band where the guitar player don\u2019t tune, you either have a very stable stage temperature and a well adjusted guitar played by an experienced player, or a pro level band with a guitar tech behind the scene \u2026 or an amateur act that don\u2019t notice (or don\u2019t care) that the instrument is out of tune.

            "answer_text": "Q: Why do guitar players tune their instruments in the middle of a song? I've seen it even when they are not doing things that would destabilize tuning like dive-bombing. Should have tuned before a set or at least between songs? Nervous habit? A: It\u2019s gone out of tune and needs fixed\u2014sounds awful to leave it there. Guitars can go out of tune without vibrato (whammy) bar abuse or SRV bends. But temperature is the tuning enemy, afflicting stringed instruments from violin to grand piano. Variables such as instrument quality, string type, and string age matter, but none are immune. Any tuned string is in balance. The mass and length of the string, the tension on it. These all affect its pitch. Even plucking/strumming hard will raise it slightly sharp. Air temperature causes expansion/contraction with heat/cold\u2014strings stretch and go flat. The structure suspending the string is different material and so expands at a different rate. But when it catches up\u2014you go back sharp. At equilibrium, a good guitar stays in tune well. Seasonal fluctuations disrupt the balance\u2014as do the air conditioners and heaters we humans use to combat them. Outdoor festivals are completely subject to nature\u2026 Soundcheck in earlier afternoon, when it\u2019s hot. Later the entire area cools continually for hours, and every few minutes the instrument is out of tune again. A vibrato bar\u2019s counter-springs\u2014pulling in opposition to string tension\u2014are also subject to temperature gradients. A cold draft off a window. A door being opened. Sunbeam through a window. I\u2019ve even heard strings slightly detune after washing my hands in hot water. Sometimes the minuscule problem is nearly inaudible with the rest of the band still playing. Sometimes it\u2019s so bad it must be immediately remedied, because playing out of tune will sound worse than dropping out briefly to fix it. It\u2019s always better when the guitarist is the first to hear it and fixes before anyone else does. It\u2019s no nervous habit, but with a solo looming soon\u2014you just might be nervous to get back in tune, in time. No pun intended. ",
