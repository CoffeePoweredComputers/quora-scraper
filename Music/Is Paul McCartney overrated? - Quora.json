            "answer_text": "As musician or composer?  His bassplaying is the best I ever heard. With that he sometimes creats a complementary melody. But as composer? That depends on what/who you compare with. Formerly or today? --Yesterday was McCartney\u00b4s real breakthrough in 1965-1966. It is a good melody, no question about that. But had it been that big success without the strings? Some people said the song was\u201d innovative\u201d, in what way? they usually answer \u201dthe strings\u201d. In \u201dEleonor Rigby\u201d from 1966, the strings is even more important. That\u00b4s George Martin\u00b4s best work, specially the transition to the staccato violoins, wonderful. But is the sung melody so special? --Good marketing is neccesary for getting a hit. In the 60s You needed the song being played on radio, and by the discjockeys in the clubs. Therefor Important with good contact with the discjockeys. And also important with a press agent. --Sometimes you can choose if you want a certain song becoming a hit. For example, get it released as a single. When people heard Lennon\u00b4s Good Night in the The White Album 1968, the first time, some believed it would be released as a single. But it never happened. The same thing with Lennon\u00b4s Oh Yoko in his album Imagine 1971. Lennon seemed not have appreciated that. --The question is. Why can some songs or music age, and others not? For example in the 18th century Bach\u00b4s sons were more famlous as composers than Bach the elder. My feeling is that Hey Jude, Let it Be and more, perhaps are less popular today than in the 60s ? Correct me if I am wrong. I myself would prefer Paul Ankas\u00b4s Time to Cry, Put Your Hand on My Shoulder, Don\u00b4t Gamble With Love, My Home town and Dance on Little Girl from the 50s over McCartney. Besides that, Anka is a better singer. ",

            "answer_text": "No. He was the most creative person in the Beatles (tied with Lennon) and the two of them led the way for most popular music of their generation and many that followed. He wrote Yesterday, the first solo song by a Beatle - which was recorded by several thousands of other musicians and groups since. He was responsible for most of the album concepts and cover designs of the albums from Sgt Pepper through Abbey Road. He wrote sang and played every instrument on his first solo album McCartney. He then went on to found and feature in the group Wings, which had supergroup status for much of the 1970\u2019s extending the run of hit albums and singles for McCartney after the Beatles broke up. His tours are always in demand and sell out fast ever since the 1960\u2019s! At age 76 he released an album that went to #1 in its first week! Overrated? On the contrary, I would say he is still a bit underrated! ",
