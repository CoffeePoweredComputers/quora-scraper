            "answer_text": "In my opinion, it depends on your demands. Camtasia has an advantage over other screen recorders in powerful editor. If you have high requirement in editing, then Camtasia is a good choice for you. As for Bandicam, it\u2019s good at gameplay capture and device capture. So it\u2019s on your list if you have needs in these two factors. However, I use neither of them. Instead I use RecMaster which is a lightweight and feature-rich application. It\u2019s able to record live streaming, online course, high-paced gameplay \u2026 So you need to decide in accordance with your actual situation. ",
