            "answer_text": "Probably none of the above. I\u2019ve used Deezer in the past, and it seems to have a slightly larger song selection than other apps, but the advertisements and restrictions are not worth it. IHeartRadio/IHeartMedia is currently in about $6,000,000,000 of debt, so the fact that they offer a free app is probably not helping their financial situation. I usually stick with listening on YouTube, since most music is available there, usually with ads of course. But unless you pay the premium for those apps there will be annoying ads there as well. It may just be a better idea to download your music and burn it onto CD\u2019s for car travel, and/or have it stored on a phone which can be used in modern cars with an auxiliary cord. ",

They each work quite well. Members of my family also use Sirius XM and like it - it seems OK to me, if you like its curated content. ",
