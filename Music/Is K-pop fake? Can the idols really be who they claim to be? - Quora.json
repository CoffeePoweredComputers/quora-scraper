            "answer_text": "I listen to Korean music and seldom venture into the kpop waters because I\u2019m a 41 year old man but I have sampled a few. I have a few tracks in my library that could be categorised as \u201ckpop\u201d (Red Flavor\u201d and \u201ccheer up\u201d, to name 2) but only the ones that really \u201ccall out\u201d to me. Personally, I don\u2019t think kpop is fake, to a certain extent. It\u2019s manufactured, yes that much I\u2019ll say. I believe the sitters of the songs are taught exactly how to sing each note of each song exactly the way the composers want it to sound. I think the singers can sing naturally but I think they\u2019re coached to sing the songs they sing. Everything is choreographed and rehearsed just so everything is perfect. I have own wondered how kpop artists sound when they ad lib or perform acoustic sets. Solji of EXID can sing (as I\u2019ve seen on her YouTube page), but she was a vocal coach before she became an idol. I can\u2019t think of many others who could fit that bill. To sum up, are they fake? No, I don\u2019t think so. Unless you ask them to sing \u201clive\u201d (without lip syncing), then that no might become a maybe. ",
