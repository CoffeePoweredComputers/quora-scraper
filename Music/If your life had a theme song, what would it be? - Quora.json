            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A, bonnie Ms Sheila Hughes. This is a kind of nightmare question for me because there's so many! Music has had a whopping influence and focus on my life. Classically trained on the piano since six. A live music street press reviewer in my twenties then later a music journalist for four years, so I know my stuff! I have very eclectic, extensive tastes - rock, pop, blues, punk rock, art rock, post-punk, goth, but I\u2019ll try my best and narrow it to these sub-genres (ie. so, no classical, reggae, big band, jazz, offbeat and obscure) And no dance or world music. I hate that shit! . First song that totally ROCKED MY WORLD happened at age 9. It\u2019s a vivid memory. After years of practicing scales and arpeggios every afternoon, on the TV came this guy with elongated and dreamy keyboards. I remember stopping what I was doing and was rooted to the spot just watching in awestruck wonder. I realised in this moment that music and people were allowed to be WEIRD if they so choosed and I lapped it up. It put me on the path of being a weirdo for the rest of my life. And those exquisite keyboard harmonies that kick in at 2:52 still get me all goosebumped - - Gary Numan - Cars  . It didn\u2019t take long after Gary to discover this oddity either, which again changed everything, in a weird, eerie and strangely compelling way. Visage - Fade to Grey  . Few years later at age 15, I hear this on the radio. It\u2019s the 80s and there\u2019s a list of Top 40 songs in the national newspaper with phone numbers next to them. Find your favourite song, ring the number beside it and you can listen to your song over the phone at 20 cents a call. I must\u2019ve racked up about five bucks on my parents phone bill listening to this over and over, on the phone like Kate was coming in on the line from outer space - - It was kinda sexy too. I\u2019d walked through a doorway. My childhood was over. Kate Bush - Running Up That Hill  . A bit later, I begin a love affair with the cult fascination of James Dean and discovered The Smiths AND Morrissey, then discovered this video had James Dean and Morrissey in it! Seventh Heaven!!! Morrissey - Suedehead  . I also loved swooning to this and really got into this guy (which then led me to Roxy Music and Brian Eno). I also formed a major girl-crush on the model with the dark bob in this clip and love it when she faux-plays the sexy sax solo. Bryan Ferry - Don\u2019t Stop The Dance  . This is a BIG ONE. Absolutely wonderful homegrown band from my city. This band influenced me for over a decade, met them a few times backstage and Marty (raven haired, Rickenbacker guitarist) really was that stunningly beautiful in person. This song on the radio kicked it off for me to explore their back catalogue, their solo stuff and a follower of their music for 15 years. The Church - Under The Milky Way  . I don\u2019t even know where to start with this band. So I won\u2019t. I\u2019ll just say this song entered my life and blitzkrieged it. It then paved the way to discover the manic and melancholy beauty of Joy Division. New Order - True Faith  . Then I got into this wild, unearthly woman. I remember seeing her on a talk show once and after her performance she walked over to get interviewed by the host. Charlie Sheen was a guest and he stood up to shake her hand and I thought, \u2018Mate, you\u2019ve got no idea who you\u2019re up against.\u2019 P J Harvey - 50 Ft Queenie  . OH BOY, OH BOY What can I say about this strapping big unit?? Discovered him in 2005 and been hooked ever since. The guy stood at 1.98m (6\u20335) and boy can he zoot that harmonica. Howlin\u2019 Wolf - Smokestack Lightning  . Then I discovered the early roots of rockabilly and fell in love with this. Another doozie that marked my life. The Phantom - Love Me  . And FUCK the bloated, pompous rock of Pink Floyd. Syd was sooo much more original and better with his weirdo offbeat schtick! One of my eccentric ex\u2019s who was an artist got me into him. I kinda thought Syd was hot in his heyday. Syd Barrett - Octopus  . Then there was the time I danced my way through too many German discotheques when I backpacked around Europe for nine months in the 90s. This song followed me around every Deutsch disco - Goth is big there! Sisters of Mercy - Vision Thing  . Then it was these punks from New York. Saw them live, met Joey - humble and beautiful not to mention exceedingly lanky. It was a toss up between Rock n Roll High School and I Wanna Be Sedated but I\u2019ve always loved this song and it really hits the punk rock nerve in me. I\u2019ll hate myself for not including everyone else I love in this post (Nick Cave, Bowie), but this will just have to be a snippet of significant songs that have soundtracked my life. Thanks for the request, Sheila. It\u2019s been a bit melancholy knowing how much time has passed through all these, but lovely to revisit my varied delectable musical tastes that mean so much to me. I\u2019ll leave it here - - x - - Love your work, man! Thank you and good night! The Ramones - Pet Sematary  . ",
