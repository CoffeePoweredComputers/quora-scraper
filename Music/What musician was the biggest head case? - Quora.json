            "answer_text": "Alexander \u201cSkip\u201d Spence comes to mind. He started out as a drummer (even though he didn\u2019t play them very well) for the Jefferson Airplane on their first album and then moved to a band called Moby Grape as their guitarist/vocalist. They put out a great first album, but during the recording of the 2nd album Skip did a lot of drugs and had some mental problems flare up culminating in his trying to off 2 other members of the band (not to mention a doorman at the hotel they were staying at) with an axe \u201cto save them from themselves\u201d. He was committed and released and somehow was able to record a solo LP that he wrote while committed, the whacked out, but often brilliant \u201cOar\u201d, and then deteriorated further, doing copious amounts of coke, heroin & other drugs. He was in and out of institutions and often lived off of the good will of various members of Moby Grape\u2014the band he tried to do in!! He spent most of his later years as a ward of the state, due to his tendency to try to lure young girls to the various places he stayed when released. He died of lung cancer at the age of 52 (two days before his 53th) survived by 4 children & eleven grandchildren. Jim Gordon was one the greatest drummers in existence. He did sessions all through the 60s and 70s, was a sometime member of the Wrecking Crew, played on Pet Sounds, Layla, was part of Joe Cocker\u2019s Mad Dogs & Englishmen tour, among tons of other work (there is a lengthy list on wikipedia that is truly mind boggling). Let\u2019s just say the dude was good. Anyways, on June 3rd 1983, claiming voices told him to, he attacked and killed his mother with the combination of a hammer & a knife. He was convicted of murder, diagnosed with acute schizophrenia and remains imprisoned to this day. He has been up for parole several times, but denied each time due to his condition. Those 2 might be a tie for biggest head cases. ",

He\u2019s probably more famous for killing his wife and her lover, caught in the act. Being a prince AND a Count he got away with it. more recently Scriabin had strange ideas. ",
