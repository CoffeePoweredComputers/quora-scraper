            "answer_text": "I dont know why Eminem doesnt resign already. No disrespect, I was always a fan of EM. Especially in his early songs like, \u201cLose Yourself, Stan, Sing for the Moment, Marshall Mathers, Bully, etc\u2026;It just appears he craves attention a lot. Its like his thirst for attention will not stop. Seriously, we get it, lol. Not to mention the fact that he disses just about everyone. Eminem needs to retire now. I dont think he is relevant anymore. But somehow in his head, it seems he always wants to be center of attention, and have the Spotlight always on him. Come on man, just let it go already, put down the pen. I dont listen to his current songs . He has become very annoying. ",
