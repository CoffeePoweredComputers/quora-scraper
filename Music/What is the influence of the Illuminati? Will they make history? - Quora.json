            "answer_text": "What is the influence of the Illuminati? Will they make history? The Illuminati are history. They were a small group of radical thinkers whose group was disbanded in the late 18th century. They have no influence, though most of their ambitions have largely been realised. The Illuminati of modern myth/conspiracy fantasy came from the Discordians and the comic fiction of Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson and those they influenced. It lives on as a deranged fantasy in the minds of fundamentalists, unhinged right-wingers and the mentally unstable. ",
