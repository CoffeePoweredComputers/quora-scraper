            "answer_text": "Japanese music usually uses a pentatonic scale, easiest managed by only using the black keys on a piano. Transpose, add a few authentically Japanese instruments if you like, so that it doesn\u2019t sound like something played on a grand (or upright, organ, or keytar) as needed. A Yamaha piano or organ doesn\u2019t count as \u201cauthentic\u201d, though. ",
