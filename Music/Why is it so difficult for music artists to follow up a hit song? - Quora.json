            "answer_text": "I don't think there's a single answer or that it's possible to know all the causes. Certainly all the answers given here contribute. One thing I haven't seen yet: the stifling effect on creativity that success can foster. The struggling musician toils in the studio trying to create great music that expresses something personal and universal. They don't know what \"works\" so they are fearless and can try out stupid ideas without pressure. All they care about is crafting something that they love and are proud of. Most of it will be crap. Some will be good. If they're talented and dedicated, a few will be great. And if the stars align and they stumble on the right combination of sounds and timing, one of their ideas might hit the jackpot. Suddenly everything changes. Now they are a Successful Hit Artist. They start to feel they should \"know\" what works. And they are under pressure to deliver again. There's a good chance they also have the distractions of fame to contend with. Their goal changes from \"make great music\" to \"keep being a hit artist\". It's possible that the driving force that inspired them to get to their first hit is gone. Staying at the top is a different game than getting there. In short, all the factors that helped them to find a hit in the first place have been removed. The temptation is strong to stay safe and repeat what they know worked last time. They stop taking creative risks. They might result a perfectly OK song, but can't deliver at least one ingredient that leads to a hit single: newness.  I suspect that the people who write multiple hits find a way to counteract all the negative factors. They find ways to stay hungry, ways to mitigate the effects of fear and ways to keep taking risks.

            "answer_text": "It's mainly due to artists having years to write their first album before they get signed. After the initial signing, most record labels pressure the artists to put out the next album within 2 years time. This doesn't leave the artist much time to write, record, and produce a follow up. Especially when you factor in that they are most likely touring for a majority of that time, as well.  That is why I've always enjoyed going back to listen to an artists debut album. You usually get to hear years and years worth of hard work, all rolled in to one LP. It also gives you an insight as to how they originally wanted their overall sound/style to be. ",
