            "answer_text": "I listened a lot to Bowie when I was younger but with time I have to admit that Bowie was not the best musician the world has ever seen. His Ziggy Stardust album was amazing, but the albums after are, while creative and odd, disjointed. Bowie\u2019s mental sufferings that started after Ziggy Stardust contributed. His \u201cart for the sake of art\u201d-mentality is also one that I now no longer believe is to be admired. Everything is political, and it is cowardice to make art that doesn\u2019t try to make any statements in either a left-wing or right-wing direction. Being odd for the sake of being odd is not admirable, and it mainly seems to be what Bowie fans like about him. So did I, until I was dispelled. Is his music good? Yes, many of his songs are great, but one gets the feeling that he could have done something better. He could have made statements. It\u2019s like he always tries to reach some point but never gets there, trying to make a statement that never gets stated. I guess it\u2019s this mysterious aura that gives him the renowned sex appeal so often mentioned. But he spent his life trying to avoid making statements (with the notable exception of when he said that Britain was ready for fascism that he later blamed either on drugs or on saying that he simply believed Britain was headed for fascism for a while). Not taking a stance on anything also means to approve of everything and I think that is bad for a person\u2019s mental health, as was probably the case with Bowie. He couldn\u2019t even take a stance on what his sexuality was, and only in his 60s did he confess that he was in fact never bisexual and that it was a mistake to say he was. What can we learn from Bowie? Some say Bowie inspires us to be ourselves, but Bowie was always about being someone else \u2014 to be anyone you want as long as it\u2019s not yourself. They might think that Bowie was about exploring himself and that he was a revealing person, but I say the opposite: we have no idea what Bowie truly felt about anything. That\u2019s not bravery, that\u2019s just running away. I will continue to listen to Bowie songs and he probably was one of the few geniuses of pop-music but I no longer idolize him. ",
