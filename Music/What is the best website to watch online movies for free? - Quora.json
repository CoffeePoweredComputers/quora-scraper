Although the movies you are going to find at full length, for free, are independent movies made on shoe string budgets by people you have never heard of. But there are no sites that can legally offer Hollywood movies for free. They get shut down in 4\u201316 weeks because of copyright infringement, with the owners often arrested for internet piracy.

            "answer_text": "I'm glad you requested my answer to this question. If you're looking for a legal source, I imagine Hulu is your best bet, but I think the initial question refers to browser-based torrent websites. I know several, but all I have to say is please don't use these. I am a filmmaker. I've had multiple twelve hour days on film sets where I've worked to the point of exhaustion to improve my craft and give others entertainment. And so did the dozens of other individuals I work with. Every time you access these torrent sites, you're taking away valuable income for the people who slave away to make content. The plucky young filmmakers I worked with won't get paid. You're taking money away from a production studio's bottom-line, who then hire one less grip or one less sound operator. That's one hard-working individual who needed that job to make money. Filmmakers may seem like we live in some strange world separate to all others, and to some degree, yes, that's true. But we're people, and the human element we put into our movies make them what they are. My industry has been plagued with piracy issues since piracy began referring to illegal downloads, and it makes it so each time you access those sites, there are less and less of those free movies for you to watch. Please. If you really, really want something like free movies, buy secondhand. It's a legal way of supporting a local retailer who got that film from someone who likely loves the movies. Most pawnshops I know sell DVDs for $1 or $2 max. The entertainment industry thrives because dedicated cinema enthusiasts pay for our products. Full stop. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
