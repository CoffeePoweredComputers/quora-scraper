            "answer_text": "Doesn't it have something to do with how many songs they used to be able to fit on the vinyls? Single is one song EL is 4\u20136 songs max and an LP is 12 -13 songs.. so if that's all they could fit on the back then and if they were short enough songs and could fit more on there then they called it bonus.. thats my best educated guess tho today they don't have that problem with space on the cd so maybe what the guy 2 or 3 posts down might be right pertaining to the era we are in.. but like I said back in the day I'm prettty sure I'm right my parents were at Woodstock (father only) and I remember him telling me the reason behind the EP LP and bonus.. I remember me telling him this is why I fucking suck at English at school cause our language is stupid hard to learn and still once you learn it makes no sense, I said why have diff names cuz of how many songs on it!??!? It's still a vinyl or cd Etc. i said how fucking stupid its all about money just like everything else so they can copyright the 2 or 3 terms (not sure if u can copyright a word like bonus but definitely LP EL were copyrighted) and also so they could make more money by releasing an EL then a few months later the LP with the same songs as the EL but then just add 6\u20138 more songs so you are a sensually just buying 2 ELs. I asked him if that was ever a factor in him when he used to buy vinyls he told me no he brought them all from singles to ELs LPs, which to me proves that it was all about the money for them (not saying the artists but there labels they bellonged too and prob even some artists) why buy 1 cd with all the songs on it if ppl were willing to buy the singles then the EL with that single on it and then the LP with the songs from the single and EL on it.. so your buying 3 vinyles/cds etc yet you still only have one if you think about it cause u will never take out and listen to the single of the song or the EL once you got the LP.. it's sickening when you think about how much ppl love money, I kno ppl who would sell there parent/family/best friend for nothing.. sad world we live in when ppl care more about a piece of paper/cotton then they do about there fellow men, women, animals, and most importantly this planets we live on, once we tottally kill it (which a lot of it is dead or dieing because of us and only us)guess who goes next\u2026 We do then guess what all the money these fuckers think thats so important to \u201clife\u201d you wouldnt even be able to buy an apple with a billion dollars, so if we Dnt die as soon as we destroy this planet and some linger here and there I hope that Forbes last list they can print will say instead of the \u201c\"list of billionaires\u201d is the \u201c\"list of who's the dumbest fuck that spent there lifes doing nothing for the good of anyone or anything and instead choose to collect toilet paper\u201d because thats all there money will be good for, and gold might be worth something still for like a week cause there will be morons who think that's important but until you can eat gold or drink it and you can survive off of it it's worthless as well\u2026 wow now that was some rant sry I went way off topic but its almost 4 am where I'm at and I'm wired got billions of things running threw my head as you could see.. tell you one thing I never wrote this much for any English class in my life  never passed and English class in my life as you could probably tell by reading this, I'm a genius in math and science tho so I rather it the way I'm, math I used way more in my life then writing essays and reports and shit like that as long and you can follow and understand what Im talking about that's all that matter.. I'm outie before I going into something else, I hope at least one or two ppl enjoys this as much as I enjoyed randomly venting about shit  ",

            "answer_text": "There might be several reasons.   Different versions of the same album are always released simultaneously in Japan, the expensive version with the bonus tracks/ videos, and the non-bonus cheaper version with a different cover(always much more beautiful). For example:CIRCLE CYCLE - Shibasaki KouThe normal version (cheaper, non-bonus, different cover) Amazon.co.jp\uff1a CIRCLE CYCLE: \u97f3\u697d  while the bonus version (more expensive, with bonus disc, different cover) Amazon.co.jp\uff1a CIRCLE CYCLE(\u521d\u56de\u9650\u5b9a\u76e4)(DVD\u4ed8): \u97f3\u697d  (images from Amazon.co.jp\uff1a \u901a\u8ca9 - \u30d5\u30a1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3001\u5bb6\u96fb\u304b\u3089\u98df\u54c1\u307e\u3067\u3010\u7121\u6599\u914d\u9001\u3011) The aim of this kind of promotion is obviously to force fans (who wants the two covers and all of the bonus tracks/ videos just like me) to by both of the two version. It is reported that the peak of sales volume always appears after the release of the album, therefore in Japan they usually use the \"first-run limited edition recording\" with bonus to enhance the sales in the first several weeks. And sometimes bonus track is often used as an incentive to encourage customers to purchase the different version of the album they already have. See this expanded version of Christmas: Special Edition_Michael Buble Special Edition: \u97f3\u697d ,with a five-track-bonus compared with the normal version Amazon.co.jp\uff1a Christmas: \u97f3\u697d  . Also different stores are usually offer different versions of the same album. We can always have bonus when we buy music from Apple Itunes Store as you know. In a word, \"Bonus track\" aims at encouraging customers to buy more. ",
