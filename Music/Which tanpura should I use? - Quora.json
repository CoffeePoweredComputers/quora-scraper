            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Ideally, if you are serious about classical music, you should use a real tanpura. That also means you have to spend some effort in learning how to tune it well, which is nontrivial. If you don\u2019t want to do that, then the iTanpura app for IOS is pretty good. The tanpura is decent and most common taals are inbuilt. It is a paid app and is very convenient. You can also get one of the Radel electronic tanpuras. I am not sure if they have taal function built-in or you need to buy a separate tabla machine. Apart from being stand-alone and having more intuitive controls, they are no better than an app along with an external speaker or something. All electronic tanpuras and apps have some limitations, specifically shruti perfection and the richness of the harmonics. In a pragmatic sense, however, they are adequate for all but the very serious practitioners. All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "Depends, Adding to @Chetan Vinchhi \u2018s answer above; I think if you want to use Real Acoustic Tanpura, you need the strong sense of Swar which is difficult to achieve unless you are training properly for more than 10\u201315 years. Possibilities you may end up tuning wrongly, so attempt only if you are sure. Tanpura Machines usually do not come with Tabla inbuit, so a spearate Tabla machine coupled with Electronic Tanpura can be enough of a setup for Riyaz. Definitely good to go option for serious music enthusiasts! Apps, iTanpura is quite wonderful. For Android, I use Tanpura Droid, not very accurate, serves the purpose for a while when required. Hope it helps! :) ",
