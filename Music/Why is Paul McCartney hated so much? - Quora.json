            "answer_text": "I think that the main reason behind people somewhat \"hating\" Paul has to do with a pair of things: John was the main music writer early on: Anyone who looks at the early Beatles albums will see that John was the person leading the songwriting and singing. Most of the covers, he'd be the lead singer. And that solidified John's position in the Beatles as the frontman since he'd be the main one singing in their shows. Paul did get a few good ones, but John was often the one singing. Their way of creating music is completely different: This is quite obvious, actually. Hum a Beatles melody. There's a high likeness that it'll be a Paul song. Now sing a Beatles lyric. There's a high chance that it'll be a John lyric.  Paul went for melody first, and that's why we have things like Band on the Run, Maybe I'm Amazed, Hey Jude, Let It Be and many other songs with memorable melodies but often with lyrics that did not care about issues around the world - it focused on what Paul, and those around him, felt. John, on the other hand, went for lyrics first. We have things like Xmas (War is Over), Imagine or Across the Universe or Revolution with memorable lyrics that talk about politics and philosophies and melodies that aren't just to the same level of George's composition in terms of technique or Paul's natural ability of just making songs that sounded good. Ultimately, Paul was singing about his daily life while John was singing about issues of the world. And when most people who started listening to the Beatles at an early age found themselves wondering about world issues, the one who felt like \"the leader\" of the band was also singing about it, and it was sort of a parallel to their own lifes. Personally, Paul does make some excellent songs nowadays that are just outshone by the popularity of older songs like Band on the Run, Hey Jude and Jet (although I do prefer his live renditions of the Band on the Run album in shows like Good Evening New York), such as Only Mama Knows, Highway, Calico Skies and Sing the Changes. In the end, Paul was always a good songwriter who liked to focus on his issues on his songwriting - he generally wouldn't connect his songs with what he was being active towards such as vegetarianism for example, and that sort of lead to him being \"shallower\" due to how he wrote songs and to what he wrote songs - often to himself, or to people close to him. There's a degree of connection you can make with his life and our life that makes his songs a lot closer to us than John's, but they didn't focus on the bigger area, really. That's just my two cents, really. ",

            "answer_text": "Paul has always intrigued me, in that, for as much as we know him over the last 50 years, I have never felt like I really knew him (in as much as we can know someone from afar). To me, he always seemed to be more interested in how people perceived him rather than just be himself and let the cookies fall where they may fall. And having just finished up a book on him, I came away pretty much still thinking the same thing. I think he has always been very image conscience, about himself and The Beatles. As for the 4 of them\u2026clearly they all did things in the later Beatle years that were not very becoming. John became a complete in your face dick. Paul had become overbearing in his desire to keep moving The Beatles forward. George just became fed up with having to play third fiddle to Paul and John. I think he wanted out before any of the others. Ringo\u2026.well, he\u2019s just Ringo :) So I don\u2019t place any extra blame on any of them as far as the end of The Beatles go. They clearly just needed to break up. It\u2019s a shame they couldn\u2019t have done it a bit more gentlemanly, but what can you do. As for Paul, and him being \u201chated\u201d, I\u2019m not really sure about that...i don\u2019t really think that is true. However, I do think Paul was set up for abuse in that, I\u2019ve always felt the mantle of The Beatles was put more squarely on him than the others. Paul was the one that was supposed to be as good as The Beatles or better. I don\u2019t think the others had that as much. Talk about being set up to fail! Plus, over the years Paul did build up a rep that he was a bit difficult to work with in the studio. There were very few people who could stand up to him in the studio and challenge him to do better (which worked to his detriment over the years, if you ask me). But, \u201chated\u201d? such a strong word. EDIT: I just remember something from Phil Collins\u2019 autobiography. According to his book, he certainly does not like Paul. If I recall the story, they had met backstage somewhere, and Paul in front of a group of people referred to to Phil as \u201cLittle Phil\u201d and had a bit of a disparaging tone to his comments and that REALLY rubbed Collins the wrong way. It could be Collins was just being a little too thin-skinned. Who knows. ",
