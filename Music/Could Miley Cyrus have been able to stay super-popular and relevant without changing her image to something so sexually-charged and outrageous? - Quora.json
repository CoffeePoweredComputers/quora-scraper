            "answer_text": "Selena Gomez is proof that a young woman can successfully transition from Disney star to adult star without sexing up her image.  Selena Gomez and Miley Cyrus are very similar. They are roughly the same age. Both were products of the Disney machine (incidentally, Selena even starred in a few episodes of Miley's show, Hannah Montana). Another thing they have in common: both of their 2013 albums debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard charts. Yet while Miley has gone out of her way to stir up controversy to gain attention, Selena Gomez has found success in music and film in a quiet, classy manner.  Miley's album sales surpass Selena's. However, where Selena has the advantage is in her acting career. 2012's Hotel Transylvania was a huge hit, and this year's Spring Breakers did much better than expected. One of her upcoming films, Rudderless, has an all-star cast and looks promising. By contrast, Miley's doesn't have any upcoming movies or television appearances. Her last two movies, LOL and So Undercover ... well, chances are you haven 't even heard of them. Demi Lovato is another example of a Disney actor/singer who became an adult star. After starring in several Disney-channel movies in her teens, she transitioned to a solid career as a pop star. She is 21, the same age as Selena, and her future is looking bright.  So yes, it is possible. But it is difficult. ",

            "answer_text": "More than likely, yes. The late stages of her Disney career hinted at her potential to transition into an adult star without going off the deep end (think songs like The Climb). Why she ultimately chose to go the way she did with her image is probably attributable to a number of things; using her art to work out personal demons, youthful rebellion, etc. One thing we can all probably agree on is that she was the best suited of all the Disney Stars of her generation to adopt the sexually-charged and outrageous image. Seeing the innocent, traditionally-minded Southern darling star of one of Disney Channel\u2019s biggest hits of the decade transition into an LA-based icon of 21st Century hedonism and sexual \u201cliberation\u201d would\u2019ve made for the biggest shock of all. I obviously don\u2019t know her heart and mind, and I\u2019m not within my rights to speculate. But I do wonder if she (or perhaps her management) might\u2019ve taken that reality into account when considering where to go post-Disney? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes - I think she could've gone down the route of making really good music. While limited in number, there are examples of music stars who get popular and relevant without being sexually-charged. Adele and Norah Jones come to mind. Obviously, this takes talent. This might surprise people, but I actually think Miley Cyrus is a fairly talented singer. I was shocked to see how good she was here:   She's no Adele, but she's pretty good singer. Now, people like Adele and Norah Jones aren't as relevant in pop culture (i.e., making the cover of US Weekly, being the center of gossip), and if this Miley's goal, then being sexually charged definitely helps. But I would argue someone like Taylor Swift has managed to be a musical superstar and relevant in pop culture without being super sexually charged. You could maybe say the same thing about Kelly Clarkson. Obviously, we have no counter-factual so we don't know if these alternatives would have worked, but it certainly could've been possible. ",

If she'd decided to become Ani Di Franco, for example, and write socially aware music accompanied by her own guitar then she would have immediately shed all her established fans but she would have been unlikely to pick up any more. She would have faded away and become \"whatever happened to Miley Cyrus\" Sexy is the image that pretty much every female artist needs to adopt to be big in the music industry and if you're going to compete with everyone else you have to be bigger and more noticeable. I think she went the only way she could have. ",

As a result, she is again huge and will make many more millions.  I don't know if this was Miley or Larry Rudolph, her new manager, but whoever engineered this was brilliant. ",
