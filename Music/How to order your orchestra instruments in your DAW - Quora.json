            "answer_text": "Personally i don't use a specific order.  I'll usually group them by role, i.e. Low brass and low strings together.  Violin and flue together. Because usually i findit easier to compare then if they are together.  Also, often I'll use a new instance of the instrument later in the peice instead of adding more data to the first. This ensures that the two can be easily linked to different volume settings or mixer channels. One thing i do try to do is colour code the instruments.  It depends on the song as to whether i colour code them them by role or timbre (usually timbre though) However, if writing in a program like finale or sibaleus I'll normally order them acording to the traditional standard.  And if i then import the midi data into a DAW it will usually stay in that same order. ",
