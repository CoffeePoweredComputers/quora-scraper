            "answer_text": "When choosing a violin you should play it and see how it sounds and feels.  When I choose violins, I go by the sound so I never buy online.  So it's difficult for me to say... Go with this model and you'll be fine.  Every instrument is different.   Here are some pointers in selecting a violin: Go to Your Local Violin ShopIf you are in Southern California Moreys Music in Long Beach is awesome!  I bought my acoustic at Moreys and love it.  I bought my electric violin on Amazon and dislike it. More abt that below. Prepare a Variety of PiecesGet a couple of songs ready when you are testing violins.  You can use one piece that has the following types of passages\uff1a Slow partFast partPart where you shift Piece that is on the g and d stringPiece that is on the a and e stringListen to the tonePlay the slow lyrical piece and the pieces that are on the g and d as well as the a and e strings. What does the violin sound like when you go between strings?  What is the sound like during th lyrical piece?  Is the sound loud and harsh or scratchy like you said?  Or is it muted and sweet?    A good violin is muted and sweet.   How Does It PlayWhen you play it should be easy to play.  Move your left hand around the neck.  Play the fast piece and the shifting piece.  How does it feel.  It should feel smooth Buy the Violin You TriedBuy the violin you like at the store.  After you have tried it, buy it.  Don't get the model number and buy it online because it will not be the same.  Every violin is different.   When I purchased my electric I went against my usual mantra of buying what I played.  I actually tested an NS electric violin at a trade show and loved it.  They didn't sell the violin there and so I bought it on Amazon.  The violin that was delivered wasn't the same. It doesn't play well and it doesn't fit my arm, neck or body well.  It sounds amazing but I don't like playing it because it's uncomfortable. ",

            "answer_text": "I had a nice $400-$500 violin by Scherl & Roth and used it for a few years in college. I liked it because it had a versatile sound: dark-ish on the G string, warm on the D and A strings, and bright and present on the E string. This meant the instrument was suited for a variety of repertoire. I like the Strad copies, too, at the level you are looking for. They are comparable to the ones I mentioned, and maybe a little darker in timbre. These are good advanced student models in your price range. Another brand I really like is Carlo Robelli. They're slightly more expensive than the Strad copies, but they have a richer and more resonant sound. I would recommend playing violins in person. Go to a music store and try out violins. Have an idea in mind of what kind of sound you like. Play some of your repertoire on them and compare the differences. Be sure to bring your own violin, shoulder rest, bow, etc. to get an accurate picture of what it's like. Or you can go to a website like Johnson Strings and have a violin mailed to you to try for 7 days, then you mail it back if you don't want to buy it. (You can do that with bows, too.) Another option is Craigslist, where you can visit a seller's house to try the violin before you buy.  Remember that every violin is different, so you should pay attention to how it sounds, not what brand it is or how much it costs. Don't buy on Amazon\u2014violin shopping is NOT like a box of chocolates (you never know what you're gonna get!) ",
