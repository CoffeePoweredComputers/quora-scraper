            "answer_text": "If you\u2019ve got the chops to counter your lack of theory then you can still get into Berklee. One of the first things you\u2019ll do when you start is take placement exams for ear training, music theory, arranging and the like. You also tryout on your instrument and have to play different styles, sight read, play a prepared piece, run through scales and the like. They will then place you into the appropriate courses and with the appropriate instructor. The more lacking your skills, the more remedial courses you\u2019ll have to take. If you are considering Berklee, now might be the time to find an instructor who can give you a crash course in sight reading, ear training, theory. I\u2019d recommend calling the Berklee book store and finding what core books they use for instruction on your instrument and buy them. Have your instructors run through those books with you so you\u2019re familiar with material before you walk through the doors. ",

            "answer_text": "A guitarist myself, I had no trouble getting accepted with no sight reading skills back in the 1970s. When I graduated in 1976 with a diploma in arranging/composition, my guitar sight reading ability wasn\u2019t much better either. They used to put us into \u201cguitar ensembles\u201d made up of 4 or 5 guitarists trying to sight read harmonized horn charts. This was supposed to help us learn that skill, but it usually sounded pretty horrible! I believe guitar is a more difficult instrument to sight read because of the two-dimensional aspect of the fret board. What I did have in the way of skills going in was a good ear and good improvisation abilities gained from playing in some professional bands before I applied there. I thoroughly enjoyed and will never forget my experiences there, although I am not a professional musician today, and would recommend Berklee as a good place to learn about what\u2019s going on in the contemporary music world.
