            "answer_text": "Various reasons, which I will try and hit here. One is for the memories. Those of us who are concert crazy love to have that document of the memory, no different from taking pictures at a wedding. another is that, to me, it is the measure of a band's capability. Many bands do not thrive live.  We call them 'studio bands', who are more adept at crafting great music through technology...  but not necessarily able to recreate that magic and that music in real time. I call it the campfire test.  Can you, mr rock star, sit at the campfire with an acoustic guitar and knock out these songs?  The best musicians can, and that is why MTV Unplugged was such a huge success. for great live bands, each show is a different experience.  Bands like Pearl Jam and the Grateful Dead play every single show differently.  You could follow them from town to town (and I have done that with both bands) and see a unique show each night. also, over the years, songs evolve live.  I have been seeing Pearl Jam for almost 25 years now, since there first tour when they were unknown openers.  I feel like I have grown up with them, and their music has been a soundtrack to my life. Lastly, live music was a forbidden fruit for a LONG LONG time.  Record companies didn't want to release live albums from their artists, and here is why.  The record companies make all their money off a band's studio album.  Tours used to be 'loss leaders' just to get a band out there to get exposure so people would buy the studio albums.  The record companies thought, wrongly, that if you had a 'bootleg' of a live show, you wouldn't bother to buy the studio album.  They were proven wrong because if someone is a big enough fan to listen to a fourth generation bootleg on cassette, of course we want the studio album. having a bootleg of your favorite band was an act of defiance, however small, against the big business model of music distribution.  Live concert recordings were straight illegal, which made them all the more appealing to a young me. Though the Grateful Dead pioneered almost all aspects of live recording and permissive trading, big credit goes to Pearl Jam.  Against their record company wishes, Pearl Jam announced long ago that anyone could record audio of any show.  Then, they took the further step and started selling every single show directly to the fans.  When this started, they put an entire tour on sale one day.  When they did this, they put 20 albums on the top 100 chart that week.  It shattered records, and the industry took notice.  the record company makes tons of money this way, and so do the bands.  Plus, there is now quality control. I am not here to promote my music site, but since you asked, I wrote about this quite thoroughly on a couple of posts a few years ago.  I'll post the links below.  They are a little long and rambly, I should tighten them up, but there is a LOT of good info in there for your curious mind. I took a look at the history of bootlegging through the experience of two bands, the Dead, and Pearl Jam.  in short, the Dead invented it, and Pearl Jam took the ball and ran with it... bringing it into the new century. the history of live music and bootlegging - in 2 bands the history of live music and bootlegging - in 2 bands - PART 2 make sense?  Feel free to ask follow up questions, or ask me to clarify any of it.  I am very passionate about live music; from the love of music, to the business aspects of it. ",

            "answer_text": "I think recording concerts is a form of historical documentation .Its a way of capturing a musical event in time.Bands change over years.Weather its voice, style,or even band members .So to have a recording of an event that will only happen once ,to me is something special.I had a friend many years ago.We both were Frank Zappa fans.I was at his house and we were talking about the Zappa shows we had attended over the years.He tells me after I give him the info on the shows I saw ,that he has bootlegs of a few of those shows.And,he would make me a copy of each.Afterlistening to those , I was hooked.But,something else happened during those times. It was before the internet,and bootlegs were traded through mail,on cassette tapes.I found out there was no bootlegs of certain shows I attended.None to be found .I had decided at that time I would record every show I attended from this point on.I love listening to live concerts.Weather I was there or not.But If I was there ,There's a live record of it. Some come out perfect sounding,others not so good.Depends on where I sit ,and the place and so on.But musical historical recordings are something special ,especially since my generation is looking our musical heroes ,more each yeat.So,while people are holding their phones up for video,ill be quietly recording an audio version of that show In at.And maybe someday you'll be listening to it and enjoying it.Thanks to all those who recorded during the years that tapes had to be used ,flipped and equipment hidden.And to those who carry in the tradition.Share,don't sell.
