            "answer_text": "You can trade it in for a real instrument\u2026 ;-) The best thing you can do is learn to read music and learn to play the instrument at a quality level. The ukulele is so much a \u201chobby\u201d instrument. Due to it being fairly easy to learn, it is one of the \u201claziest\u201d instruments to learn. Most students are kids who love the \u201clittle guitar\u201d, although they often still don\u2019t want to really work on playing the instrument well. It\u2019s an instrument. Learn to play it at a high level. Show people that you can focus enough to become a major player. It\u2019s been done, but not often. ",
