            "answer_text": "Because music is well-represented by math. To start, consider this sound wave:  That\u2019s the chord A-C#-E, or A Major. You can see how there are three equations, using sine waves. The accumulative interference of each note creates that messy looking wave. You can see each individual note below:    The sine waves are really nothing more than the air moving as you see represented here. Each note has an oscillation speed, or frequency. The volume would be the amplitude. That\u2019s pretty basic, but do you notice how A is set at 880? The 880 is a frequency of the A note. What do you think 880 / 2 is? It\u2019s a frequency of 440, and it turns out that 440 is also A, or one octave below the A shown above. Note progressions and chords that we commonly consider pleasant (or tonal) have a certain ratio. The ratio between A and E is 880 : 1320, or 2/3 . This interval is called a 5th because E is 5 notes away from A, like here: A, B, C#, D, E Similarly, the ration between A and C# is 880/1100, or 4/5. This is called a 3rd, because C is 3 notes away from A, like here: A, B, C# You notice that I\u2019ve been use the term \u201cmajor\u201d a lot here. This is because the entire A major scale is here: A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G# In order to crate the A Major chord, you know you need the 1, 3, and 5. You can see that the 1, 3, and 5 is A, C#, and E. If you wanted to create the A Major 7 (or more commonly called A7), you would want to add the 7th note, which you can see is G#, thus A7 is A, C#, E, G#. The same goes for any other chord. If you want to create the A Minor (or Am) chord, you take the notes from the A minor scale and build to find the 1, 3, and 5: A, B, C, D, E, F, G Am = A, C, E * It may be hard to understand exactly why A Major is different than A Minor. We can use a bit of mathy stuff to work this out. Let\u2019s start by showing every note: A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G# If you look at the above, you can see an interesting pattern emerge. There are notes that have sharps and notes that do not have sharps. The distance between A and B is called a \u201cwhole step,\u201d whereas the distance between B and C is a \u201chalf step.\u201d To pull out the C major scale, we would start at C and use the pattern W, W, H, W, W, W, H, which equated to C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C To get A major, we would use the same pattern, but start at A. If you try it, you will end up with the A major scale above. We can also do the opposite, shifting the pattern to get new scales (or what we call modes). For example, if we use W, H, W, W, W, H, W instead, we get a different pattern if we start at C, which is C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb, C, or the C Dorian mode. With all this shifting, we end up getting back to the Aeolian mode or, the minor mode, which has the pattern W, H, W, W, H, W, W. If you try that starting at A, you will end up with A, B, C, D, E, F, G. * So, we have sine waves, frequencies, counting, little patterns, intervals, and more. All of this isn\u2019t exactly college-level mathematics, but there is a lot more that can get a little more complex. If you are curious, look up how pianos are tuned and the interesting compromises that come along with getting intervals to work well with each other. If you feel that you aren\u2019t quite satisfied with the scholastic level of music, you can really look into destructive and constructive interference, Fast Fourier Transforms, and more. Now, musicians don\u2019t really use a lot of crazy math, though we all do think in interviews and patterns, which is the foundation of tonality. ",

            "answer_text": "As a trained applied mathematician, my best lesson in numbers came in the final year of my degree at Wits University, Johannesburg, 1976. This was when I attended a few lectures in History and Appreciation of Music given by Andrew Tracey, son of the famous Hugh Tracey, who made the first systematic recordings ever of African music\u2014I grew up with those recordings. Andrew Tracey lectures at Grahamstown University and specialises in African and Caribbean rhythms, especially cross rhythms. He explained how all African music is cyclic, different rhythms working against each other, and coming together on the \u201cOne\u201d. He said the narrative style of Western music\u2014la la, la la, la la\u2026\u2014is completely alien to the African musician\u2019s ear. It might be pretty, but it just seems to be going nowhere to their ears. They find it hilarious to see an orchestra sitting there and spending most of their time not playing. The thing with cross rhythms is that, like the footballer Thomas M\u00fcller\u2014the self-described raumdeuter or space investigator\u2014you are always looking for the gaps, and then the gaps within the gaps. The Chopi xylophone orchestras of southern Mozambique are probably the world\u2019s greatest exponents of this art. There can easily be 20 people playing in an ensemble, each weaving a line through all the others, creating little co-melodies with their neighbours, then moving around the circle to create even deeper combinations. Above all, these musicians play different rhythms within themselves. The first example Andrew gave us\u2014the archetypal cross rhythm, apart from simple doubling of frequency\u2014is two against three. He showed us how to vocalise this: \u201cIM - POS - i - BLE\u201d for the three, and \u201cWHERE\u2019s the KET - tle\u201d for the two. Then your right hand is counting three, your left hand two; and you can shift between these rhythms in your mind, just by changing the words you\u2019re saying, while your hands don\u2019t change at all. For me, this was an instant Jedi mind trick of the highest order. Here is a way you can separate the workings of your left and right brain, making them fully autonomous\u2014not automatic: by definition, automatic behaviour ceases to be automatic the moment you pay attention to it, and here you are very much able to switch your attention consciously without affecting the beat. I\u2019ve spent 40 years now working out all kinds of cross rhythms. The greatest system I know for exploring this science is a system called TaKeTiNa, you can check it out for yourself. TaKeTiNa is my yoga, I do a couple of hours of it every day; you are keeping three rhythms going at once, stepping, clapping, and chanting. Now, what has this to do with mathematics? Patience, please, we are getting to the crunch. It\u2019s a truism that Western music teachers around here, in southern Africa, say that \u201cAfricans always sing out of tune.\u201d It\u2019s a fact: they have to be trained to sing the do - re - mi scale, at least in the old days before iPods. The reason is that African music, almost universally, follows the harmonic or overtone scale. This is the scale almost universally used across Africa. There\u2019s a cowherd around here who often plays the hosepipe, which produces a beautiful overtone scale. You can see the original African instrument this is based on here:  This is Pedro the Music Man, who often performs here in Swaziland, I\u2019ve got a few of his hand-made instruments. Now, the overtone scale is a mathematically perfect creation. It is simply the fundamental frequency, plus the first harmonic (double the frequency), the second harmonic (three times the frequency) and so on. Literally, it\u2019s quantum physics, the tones jump from one frequency to another, you can\u2019t get anything in between. Harmonics of vibrating strings were exactly what Planck had in mind when he proposed the quantum of energy. They tell us that you don\u2019t see quantum effects at the macro level\u2014this is bollocks. The musical scale, the do - re - mi, is derived from the overtone scale, only in the West they then went and \u201ctempered\u201d the scale \u2014 using a mixture of mathematics and musical judgement\u2014and Bach then went and froze this machinery into the Western mindset with his Well-Tempered Clavier, one piece in each of the new re-engineered keys. The trouble, however, is that the well-tempered scheme simply doesn\u2019t work. It always has contradictions, and you are lucky if a scale is in tune with itself, let alone any other scale. The strongest overtone within a note is the fifth, i.e., when you play the note of C, a very strong G is actually contained within it. If you have a well-tempered scale, the G on your keyboard will not be in tune with the G resonating in your C note. If there\u2019s even a slight discrepancy, there will be beat notes, the kind of nasty dissonance you get when you play two semitones together. So even your C scale is a mess, and they actually jig it so that it sounds more in tune. Ornette Coleman, the great jazz composer, created a system called \u201charmolodics\u201d in which you only play in your instrument\u2019s key of C. Go watch a video of him playing a piano, you\u2019ll see he hits the white notes pretty hard. In truth, the only key on the piano that is remotely in tune is the key of C. Nonetheless, the ears of the world have been bent to fit the Western scale. But listen to what I\u2019m saying here. If you look carefully, you will see that ALL of physics and ALL of mathematics\u2014indeed, the whole of reality\u2014is contained in the frequencies and the overtones, the tapestry of cross-rhythms happening in each and every note. Quantum physics bears out a truism of Hermetic science, which includes the dictum that \u201cAll is Vibration\u201d. Atoms are systems of frequencies. Photons are, by definition, just plain electromagnetic frequency and nothing else (we get our very definition of time from the vibrations of light emitted by atoms\u2014if these atoms decided to emit light of different frequency, the unit of time would change accordingly, and we would never be able to tell). So if everything is composed of characteristic vibrations, then science is nothing more than the art of decoding and interpreting these vibrations. There was a very famous physicist who explored both cross-rhythms and overtone singing quite obsessively, and this was Richard Feynman, of course. His constant drumming, on tables, doors, and walls, counting all kinds of absurd rhythms like eleven against twelve (according to his biography), must surely have contributed to his undoubted Jedi-like mind tricks in producing wizardly formulations in physics and maths. If you look in the \u201cwhat would a smart alien be able to do\u201d category, one thing you\u2019ll find is this: they would be able to compose a piece of music spontaneously that is entirely symmetric within itself, like creating a palindrome on the fly, the same backwards and forwards. Now, this is actually a completely normal skill for an advanced African musician. Whenever you create a true cross rhythm, it\u2019s always symmetric, it plays the same backwards as forwards. And as you begin each cycle, you are anticipating how you\u2019ll end it. Western mathematicians have something they call \u201cpartition theory\u201d, how can you break a number down. An advanced African musician will get very bored playing 16 beats as 4 times 4. Like with an Indian percussionist, soon you\u2019ll find a 7 - 7 - 2 emerging, something, just to keep the party interesting. Now, there\u2019s another dimension. Chaos theory gets its name from a mathematical theorem by James Yorke, showing that anything with a periodicity of three shows a profusion of frequencies. \u201cPeriod Three Implies Chaos\u201d, was the title of his paper, as I recall, which was widely distributed. Now, Period Three is actually just the second overtone, the G contained within the C. And if you write out the overtone scale, you\u2019ll immediately see that all other notes in the scale\u2014apart from the C and its octaves\u2014actually arise from the G. You might as well say, the second overtone produces all other notes, it\u2019s Yorke\u2019s theorem clear as day. The mechanism is something call line splitting or phase doubling, which was a big problem in early chaos theory. In fact, it\u2019s right there in the overtone scale. I really hope you are getting the picture here. I\u2019m saying that music, the exploration of these frequencies and their simultaneous combination, and their simultaneous combining in your mind, comprises everything we know as physics and mathematics. Western mathematicians count to two, yes; they count to three, yes; but can they do both at the same time? Such a simple trick? Yet one which will put their minds in another state, where left and right brain are acting autonomously? To an African musician, the truth is that these people cannot even really count to \u201cone\u201d. That\u2019s just sad. One last point, a kind of true epistemological, philosophical point that you can prove through the overtones. The overtones are produced by a note essentially combining with itself. Whenever you get two frequencies combining, you get a sum and a difference frequency, an addition and a subtraction. (It\u2019s a bit more complicated than that, but for the purposes of sound waves in the air, it\u2019s good enough). So, you take a frequency of 1. And you overblow it (on your hosepipe) so it starts combining with itself. You can go and look at the equations, you will get a sum and a difference. The sum is easy: 1 + 1 = 2, that is the octave. You can hear that. That is double the frequency. What is the difference? It\u2019s 1 - 1 = 0, that\u2019s what it is. This teaches us that zero derives from the one, not the other way around. You can never get something out of nothing. That zero, I believe, represents exactly what they call the zero-point energy: the background pseudo-stability of the vacuum, which actually represents an enormous tension created by the self-cancellation of all waves. There, OK, that\u2019s the best I can do. All of physics, all of mathematics, all of music, come from the overtone scale. And in this light, we can see that some of the very greatest physicists and mathematicians in the world are right here, in Africa. ",
