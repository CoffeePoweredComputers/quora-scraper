            "answer_text": "Positively not. Like professional athlete, professional musician is reserved for a small fraction of all those who would vie for the position. You can be talented, hardworking and lucky. However you may not be adept at the particular instrument or style which would make you a success. Back in the 50\u2019s guitar was a lot less popular than it is today. It was not a lead instrument, but a rhythm section one. Rock and Roll changed that overnight. And many people who specialized in the pop music of the 1940s were no longer on the fast track to success. However, in the old days the cost of living was much lower. Rent was very little when compared to todays rent in inflation adjusted dollars. So one could be a very competent musician and make a satisfactory living playing dancehalls cruises and the like. Today there are not so many avenues for employment as a live musician. Music reproduction is everywhere, in every part of our lives. So we no longer feel as compelled to go see live music regularly. It has been quite supplanted by DJ culture in the dance halls. Once upon a time there was much work for well educated, professional musicians as studio hands. There is still an opportunity here. But this is no shortcut. You really have to know theory backwards and forwards. Able to summon various styles and feels on demand and not be an egocentric person. As the desmands of session work only have space for the egos of the artists and producers. I am sorry to be pessimistic. But I would not want to give you bad advice and lead you down the primrose path. A great career would be to apprentice in one of the trades. There is always work for plumbers electricians and carpenters. The men and women I know who got into the trades and applied themselves were able to build a decent business. If they took all the work they were offered and did not fall prey to alcohol abuse, they were able to build a decent business which employed other people as well. And put their kids through college, bought a house and all that corny American dream stuff. Realistically the best way to make a living from music is to make your money off of musicians. There are thousands of people dreaming of making it big. Positioning yourself as a manager, selling music equipment, renting rehearsal space, running a label. Essentially being a parasite on musicians is the only surefire way to make music a full time career. ",

            "answer_text": "99% of the important well-paid work in La Nashv il le New York in other major production areas is done by less than two dozen musician. .. you have extraordinary gifts and talent. Great studio players\u2026 they can sound like Eddie Van Halen Stevie Ray Vaughan Eric Clapton are George Harrison and play any piece of music you put in front of them if they're guitar players or they can sound like Steve Gadd or Neil Peart or any other music you put in front of them and the same for horn and keyboards and singers. It is an unbelievably competitive field now and when Jersey Boys went to Broadway and they thought they could find somebody that could do Frankie Valli the audition line want around the block twice for people that were all spot-on imitators. This being said there are other areas in music where you're not nearly as glamorous or well-paying but a lot of them are being cut and one of them is in being choir and band directors in high schools and public schools and music educators in general. I started playing music in the sixties well into the 90s and I retired many years ago as I am old. LI don't regret it a bit and I always made a good living but that world no longer exists. Sadly.. and by the way I was never famous or never played on a hit record but I was always working. And often playing songs that I didn't particularly enjoy play but it paid the bills . Many are called and few are chosen and if you really have what it takes well beyond just the ability to play or sing but professionalism and the dedication to show up on time every night every gig every Studio date ready to play and work with other people you may or may not like then maybe maybe you might stand a chance but there will be dozens of people in front of you until you finally get your chance and you may only get one chance . Songwriting is a little different and if you can sing a little and play a little piano or guitar and you know how to write a good song then yes you can make a fortune but nobody can really Define exactly what a good song is but everybody recognizes a hit when they hear it. But if you got to do it and go do it and follow your own path and make no room for anyone or anything in your life until you finally get to the level of success that you want.. by the way I should add that I started playing in bands and full-time Music In All State Orchestra s' bands musical Theatre's dinner theaters in the 60s in high school and earned my earned my college degrees in music in the 70s early. It was a lot easier and a lot more open then \u2026. Than it is now. ",
