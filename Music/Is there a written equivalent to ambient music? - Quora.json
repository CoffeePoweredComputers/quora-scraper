            "answer_text": "How about this nature-descriptive classical Chinese poem? It was written by Wang Wei, a poet living in the era of the Tang dynasty (8th century). He was also a musician and a painter of nature. So here you have it: soothing the mind through the description of his surroundings, without a need for a storyline, in a written form. Try to read it with some ambient or repetitive music played in the background and see how it works out. Twenty-nine of his poems were included in a compilation called \u2018Three hundred Tang poems.\u2019 I haven\u2019t seen the book yet, but I suspect that reading them would have a similar effect on your mind as listening to hours of ambient music - with the possible addition of some ancient wisdom. Passing the Incense Temple Unknowing on a journey Deep into the cloudy peaks Alone among ancient trees A distant bell resounds Down a steep rocky path The mountain stream tumbles Through a dim pine glade In the fading light of day Before rounding a bend It settles in a pool of quiet Where the peace-filled mind At last stills the lashing dragon ",

            "answer_text": "It sounds like you need an extremely picturesque poem, but it's hard to think of something that is ultimately \u201cambivalent.\u201d That feels insulting in a way, so I am hesitant to call anything that. I suppose, if I think of it, there's one I feel okay with. The band Tool writes lyrics that are brilliant and match difficult time signatures, so I'd recommend looking up Maynard James Keenan and words he writes. He has a knack for matching music that is difficult to match! ",
