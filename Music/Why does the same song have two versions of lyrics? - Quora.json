            "answer_text": "Because music, as an art form, is neither stagnant nor fixed; and the artist retains control over what they want that artistic representation to say. It is said that Leonard Cohen wrote at least seventy-five verses for \u201cHallelujah\u201d. It\u2019s doubtful that even half of them were recorded, or that two-thirds would have even been performed more than once. Sometimes a different turn of phrase is realized by the songwriter later, and they want to capture that emotion a little more carefully. Occasionally you\u2019ll get whole lines cut or added. \u201cIn Your Eyes\u201d by Peter Gabriel comes to mind, as he\u2019s taken to skipping the line \u201cI see the doorway to a thousand churches\u201d the first time the chorus runs in most concerts in everything I\u2019ve heard or watched in the past twenty-odd years. Why? Might\u2019ve been a mistake. Might\u2019ve been a wish to save that emotion for later in the song, and build to it. I personally prefer the original, but dude\u2026the guy\u2019s Peter Gabriel. It\u2019s the same thing as asking about remakes, especially if the remake is significantly different from the original. Listen to \u201cLayla\u201d from Derek and the Dominoes, then listen to it off Clapton\u2019s \u201cUnplugged\u201d album. It\u2019s the same guy, the same songwriter, the same vocalist, the same guitarist, and yet they are two completely different versions. Why? Because he wanted to. He felt the need to explore it differently. Songs are expressions of emotion, and emotions aren\u2019t static. So why should songs be? ",
