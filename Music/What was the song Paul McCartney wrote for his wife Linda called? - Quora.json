            "answer_text": "One of the very first songs he wrote for and about her was Maybe I\u2019m Amazed. There are really too many songs he wrote for her to mention, Here is what Paul said about the subject. Paul told PEOPLE in 1993. \u201cMy Love,\u201d \u201cNo More Lonely Nights,\u201d \u201cThe Lovely Linda\u201d\u2014one of the world\u2019s best songwriters could not stop putting his feelings into music. \u201cAny love song I write,\u201d Paul said last year, \u201cis written for Linda.\u201d Paul was a very loving and loyal husband and by all accounts Linda was a great wife and they really were a happy couple. So no doubt many of his songs were based on their life together even songs that were exactly love songs like Another day. Even as the Beatles as someone else mentioned he wrote Two Of Us which was on the Let It Be album. ",

            "answer_text": "You can pretty much take any love song recorded by Paul between 1970 and 1997 and know it was written for Linda. The most famous ones are probably Maybe I\u2019m Amazed and My Love. There are some other gems out there though. Long Haired Lady is a favourite of mine along with Golden Earth Girl. The latter focuses on Linda\u2019s love of nature. Daytime Nightime Suffering was written when Linda was having restless nights after their youngest was born. Warm and Beautiful and Somedays are other notables. ",
