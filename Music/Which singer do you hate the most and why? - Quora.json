            "answer_text": "Okay, I\u2019ll bite. Charlie Puth.  Reasons why: Out-of-the-blue popularity. I have the most respect for artists who worked long years in obscurity, grinding out unappreciated EPs and playing gigs in slimy dive bars covering dad-rock songs in front of collegiate hipsters and boozehounds. (My 3 favorite bands, REM, mewithoutYou, and Modest Mouse, all followed this path.) Charlie spent a couple relatively plush years as a YouTuber, then got a lucky break \u2014 his breakthrough hit came at the right place (Furious 7) and the right time (the heart of the \u201cNew Boring\u201d pop music movement[1]) and he is now a household name.Lazy songwriting. Despite attending Berklee and earning a degree in music production, his music shows no signs of creativity or innovation. Puth\u2019s lyrics are fluffy, inoffensive, and meaningless. His musical style is for those who find Train too experimental. If you\u2019re so smart, Charlie, why don\u2019t you challenge us a little?\u201cLet\u2019s Marvin Gaye and get it on.\u201d The saddest part of that line is, knowing his fame, it\u2019s probably worked.His voice. It sounds like a crying child trapped in a well. Someone get Lassie \u2014 oh wait, that\u2019s just Top 40 radio.Ubiquity. For a few months last year, Charlie could have released absolutely any 3-minute conglomerate of noises he desired, and it would have charted, and I would have heard it. The lack of steps between My Ears and Whatever Charlie Puth Wants Me To Hear are terrifyingly few.The hair. I wasn\u2019t gonna mention it, but\u2026 ick. That ain\u2019t good either.Footnotes[1] From Downton Abbey to Kirstie's crafts \u2026 the New Boring is everywhere",

            "answer_text": "Hey violet. I don't really hate them, but I just dislike the way they're doing stuff now. -Lyrics Their songs are quite poppy and cool, but their lyrics are like on wanting abusive relationships which is like urm\u2026 what? It's different for one of their newest songs O.D.D. though. Really like the lyrics for that song and it's like a 180\u00b0 turn of the type of lyrics they usually write so that's a thumbs up for O.D.D. -Vocal abilities and instrument sounds Rena's (lead vocals) voice doesn't suit it, sometimes I think even Miranda (rhythm guitarist/keyboardist, sub vocals) can do a better job at being lead singer. Her voice is great, if you watch videos of her singing when she was younger, but nah, it doesn't suit the genre they're doing now. It still sounds alright during I Can Feel It era, but not so now. They may sound quite nice in studio versions, but the lives\u2026 Rena sounds like she can't sing lives with power and she just sounds weak, breathless and not as good as the recorded version. Most of the times, the actual band music (basically drums, bass and guitars) can't really be heard cuz of all the electronic music covering alot of it up, like you can hear the drums but its not so strong. The bass and guitar? Not so. -The disbanding of Cherri Bomb and creation of Hey Violet. If you knew about rock and stuff a couple years back, you probably would have heard of this band, Cherri Bomb, a bunch of 12\u201315 year old girls who were so successful, they were given the opening act for Foo Fighters, Smashing Pumpkins, Bush and Steel Panther, signed on to Hollywood Records and went to Warped Tour, etc. Cherri Bomb was created by Julia Pierce, lead guitarist and lead singer of the band when she was only around 11 years old, putting up calls on craiglist, music shops and stuff. She wanted an all girl rock bnd, with influences from Foo Fighters, My Chemical Romance, The Runaways, L7 and Garbage. And yeah, the band was formed and they started to make music, producing their EP, Stark and their only album, This is the End of Control. Things were cool till the parents stepped in, and that's when things started to go off. In 2013, Julia suddenly went on a hiatus and when fans asked for Julia, the others said that it was because she was sick. Then eventually they broke the news that the band parted ways with Julia due to the usual 'creative differences'. And guess what? The next day, Julia said that it wasn't her choice to leave the band. In interviews after that, she said she felt like it was a three against one situation (Nia and Rena are sisters) and there was a lack of communication and respect between the members and Julia was shocked that things turned out this way, something she totally didn't expect even if things were to go sour in the band. Hollywoods Records dropped them and eventually, Cherri Bomb was renamed Hey Violet and the idea of an all girl rock band? Completely gone. If you watched Cherri Bomb lives, songs, you'd realise that Nia's drumming skills are great there. You don't see that much in Hey Violet anymore. The drummings became so much more simpler. In Raw. Real, Rena sang parts of the song and it's really obvious that her voice was better then compared to now. With Julia gone, Rena took over as lead singer and bassist as they added in Casey as lead guitarist. Casey's guitar skills are amazing, really. But there's the all girl band idea, poof, gone. And they performed like this under the name Cherri Bomb until they changed their name to Hey Violet Signing on to Hi or Hey Records Hi or Hey Records is a record label under 5 Seconds of Summer, so wow, guess how much benefits will come in there? At that point of time, Hi or Hey had completely no one who was under them, so it was basically a record label with ABSOLUTELY no one hold. In came Hey Violet, who's a bunch of girls with crazy hairstyles and a male guitarist. So\u2026 the idea of having a band with girls is really cool, and being a girl in a band is really rare, how about 3 girls in a band and one guy? So yep, they got signed onto Hi or Hey. From there, they got in Ian who took over bass and Rena started doing vocals only instead of bass+vocals. Being under Hi or Hey which is formed by 5sos, obviously 5sos fans would get to know about Hey Violet and there you go, more fans. The fans they had lost due to the breakup with Julia had been regained by an amount of new fans who were 5sos fans. And then there was the rumours about Nia dating Calum (5sos bassist). Some said it was PR, some said it was real, but eventually after a while it was revealed that nope, they didn't have a relationship. And from that, people who knew that Calum was 'dating' Nia checked out Hey Violet and there comes the new fans. Just to get this straight out, I'm not hating on Hey Violet or anything. I'm cool with them, I listen to their music once a while, but I think the whole history behind this band is fucked up and that the genre they have now (to me) isn't nice and doesn't suit the band, doesn't show the full potential of the band either. It just makes me feel that they're doing this for fame and money, not for the passion of music. Maybe back in Cherri Bomb days, yes, passion for music. But it feels like all the fame and money got into their heads and just made them into who they are now. ",
