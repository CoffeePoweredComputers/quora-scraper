            "answer_text": "A song? What just one? seriously? That is hard. There are a lot of songs that make me stop every time I hear them. I don\u2019t know if I can pick one song. Top song for doing this is\u2026 Saint Etienne \u201cOnly Love Can Break Your Heart\u201d. (1990) It is a Neil Young cover.  I think it is the beat, or is it the rhythm repeating continuously. Hooks me in. And the music conveys the emotions that I felt around then too. The film clip is pretty good too. Honestly, I heard the song first and didn\u2019t get to see the film clip until 2010. The film clip really captures the emotions and the feelings that I know I had around the time that this was released 1989\u20131990? I came of age around the late 80\u2019s early 90\u2019s so the film clip really sums up what it was like. There is another film clip version of this song with a blond haired singer that I don\u2019t really like so much. More cause I think the really missed the essence of the time period. So I don\u2019t think it is as good. Runners up\u2026 I hope you don\u2019t mind me putting these in but these also stop me every time I hear them. Arramaieda \u201cFly Bird\u201d (1992) This song use to stop me when I heard it. It was beautiful, and what I found beautiful about it was the lyrics. I can only remember part of it. \u201cSweet bird, I love you, please fly. and if you return in fear of the storm, I will sing you this song while keeping you warm And gently I will let you go free, cause fear is where I don\u2019t want us to be, Sweet bird, I love you, please fly.\u201d It is a beautiful song and I use to play it over and over. It was my flatmates album. Fortunate for me I did that cause that song is hard to come by now. You wont find it on Youtube. So if I got to hear it again, I would definitely stop what I was doing. Jane - \u201cIt\u2019s a Fine Day\u201d (1983)  There is a film clip with it but I think this song really doesn\u2019t really need a film clip. Possibly cause it is so gentle, like delicate that a film clip will just take away from the song. The film clip is not bad. This one I put up is just the album cover. Just keeping it really simple. Beats International - \u201cDub Be Good To Me\u201d (1990)  Another cover. And features Norman Cook \u2018Fatboy Slim\u2019. I don\u2019t know what it is about this song that just grabs my attention. But it does. The film clip is really captivating too. Again, the simplicity, or seemly simplicity. the monotone image with the coloured fish. It is boopy but has a haunting feel to it. Honorable mentions\u2026. Speaking of Norman Cook and covers\u2026. The Housemartins \u201cCaravan of Love\u201d (1986)  There is something really simple and straight forward about this song. Another cover and yes, Norman Cook is in this band and film clip. He is the guy in the brown shirt. The film clip is interesting. It starts strong but gets a bit silly at the end. Fatboy Slim \u201cRight Here Right Now\u201d (1999) I have to admit when I first heard this song it really caught my attention. I don\u2019t know if it does anymore cause I have played it so many time. I drive really fast when I play it on my car cd player. Hmmm maybe I should stop doing that! It is interesting. Although the song is compelling, I wasn\u2019t really that impressed with the film clip. Mainly I think that the song can stand up so well on it\u2019s own. But I did come across another version of the film clip. Not sure if it is totally legal, but it is a much better fit for the song than the original. From the movie \u201cDuel\u201d.  The Sneaker Pimps - \u201c6 Underground\u201d (Nellee Hooper Edit) (1997) I think this song made a lot of people stop what they were doing to listen. There were a lot of people who were pretty obsessed about this song. I think it had a real underlying subtlety to it. She had a sweet voice with what seemed like hard edged lyrics.  There is also songs from\u2026 The SundaysPortisheadTrickyMy Bloody Valentines\u2019 \u201cSoon\u201d Is just so compelling.OK, I will stop now. This was going to be a quick answer for me but yet again I just seem to end up writing essays. So, what song makes you stop what you are doing every time you hear it?  I just can\u2019t stop. This song was used in a photoshop ad and it did make me stop. In fact there have been quite a few people asking after this song.  Issac Joel - Alumroot. ",

            "answer_text": "I probably won't stop what I'm doing Every time I hear it, but I Did however, stop everything I was doing when I first heard this song. This happens to me every so often but it\u2019s still rare enough. Recently I was watching an old Seth Meyers episode and his musical guest made me stop texting/knitting/watching tv and just give the band my undivided attention. Hobo Johnson and The Lovemakers. The song was Typical Story. I have both of their albums now and I am quite grateful to Seth Meyers for putting them on his show. Seriously grateful, I've composed DMs in my head, thanking him, grateful. Anyway, maybe you will like them too? I have to admit, I stop everything to yell out \u201cHey, hey, I don't think I know muchBut I know I couldn't take a good punchSo if you feel like I've been talking enoughJust tell me to shut up and I will gladly shut the fuck up!!\u201d  Enjoy.
