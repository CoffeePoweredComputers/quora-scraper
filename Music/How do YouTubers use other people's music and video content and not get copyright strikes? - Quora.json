            "answer_text": "There are a few ways that YouTube channels can use third-party content in their videos: They have written permission from the copyright owner (If you do this, it\u2019s a good idea to give credit to the copyright owner and link to a copy of the permission document.)Their video presents the third-party content in the context of criticism, commentary, news reporting, education, or parody. In these cases, you should use the minimal required amount of the third-party content, and the use should be \u201ctransformative.\u201d There is no specific guidance on what \u201ctransformative\u201d means. It\u2019s one of those things that \u201cyou know it when you see it.\u201dMusic is public domain, uses a Creative Commons license, or the copyright owner may allow use of their music but may monetize the video with ads from which they (not the channel creator) receives the revenue. YouTube\u2019s Audio Library provides links to tracks that are public domain, use a Creative Commons license, or that YouTube has contracted with the producer. Go to Creator Studio > Create > Audio LibraryYouTube lists the music policies of major producers on their Music Policies page. When music is shown as:Playback: Viewable worldwideAdvertising: Ads can appearthat means that you can use the music in your video, but the copyright owner may (is very likely to) put their ads on your video.When music is shown as:\u201cThis song is not available for use in your YouTube videos. If you use this song, your video may be blocked or muted.\u201dThe video may be removed from the channel, or the video will still be viewable but the music soundtrack may be muted.",

            "answer_text": "The copyright collecting agencies of many countries have in fact made contracts with YouTube on the use of music. Practically this means that video creators can quite often just use most commercial music on their videos. Royalties on the music will be collected and funneled to the appropriate collecting agencies of the countries where the artists reside. Of course, inappropriate use of music will still be subject to takedown notices. ",
