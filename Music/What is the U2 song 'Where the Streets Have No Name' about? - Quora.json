            "answer_text": "Its about going home to a tatty old town, that despite being a wreck of a place that you grew up in, had a great community that you miss now you been away from for so long. Its about realising your heart was there all along, though you went out to search elsewhere for it. The closest you came to religion and belief was in that community. The streets have no name there simply because you know them all like the back of your hand as a kid, so you dont use names for them. You never need to find your way by using street names because you know them like walking around your house. People only use street names for directions when they dont know a place intimately or are talking to someone who doesnt know them. The lyrics are however diverse in their spread, theres all sorts of ideas and experiences entwined in it. ",

After their wedding, instead of a traditional honeymoon, Bono and his wife went to Africa for volunteer work in an Ethiopian refugee camp. When they arrived, the UN had mounted several tents for providing first aid for the refugees. But they were so many that soon the camping became a small town, full of streets, none with actual name. That\u2019s where you got the verse \u201cHigh on a desert plain\u2026\u201d. Everyone was getting help, no matter where they came. So you can see streets with names as a sign of modern civilization, a civilization that is broken because it allows horrible things to happen, like the famine of Africa. So if you start over fresh, with streets with no name, there is a chance to make it right. ",

In the case of \"Where The Streets Have No Name,\" there are two potential references to the Bible that are found in the song: -- Revelation 22:1 \"Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb down the middle of the great street of the city.\" -- Revelation 22:21 \"The great street of the city was of pure gold, like transparent glass.\" For more about U2's Christian roots and a \"concordance\" of their lyrics linked to Scripture, please see:1 - http://www.ministryvalues.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1044&Itemid=3182 - http://www.atu2.com/lyrics/biblerefs.html ",

He recalls, \"That said something to me, and so I started writing about a place where the streets have no name.\"[15] According to him, the song is ostensibly about \"Transcendence, elevation, whatever you want to call it.\"[16] Bono, who compared many of his lyrics prior to The Joshua Tree to \"sketches\", said that \"'Where the Streets Have No Name' is more like the U2 of old than any of the other songs on the LP, because it's a sketch\u2014I was just trying to sketch a location, maybe a spiritual location, maybe a romantic location. I was trying to sketch a feeling.\"  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_the_Streets_Have_No_Name ",
