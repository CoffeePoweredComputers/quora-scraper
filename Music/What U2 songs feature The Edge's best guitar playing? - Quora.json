            "answer_text": "Edge is such an amazing guitar player and has such a unique style, while you can find some great guitar solos like the one In The Fly and Until the End of the World, the infinite guitar in With or Without you is something back in the day was very unusual. My personal favorite is Ultraviolet (Light my way), if you listen carefully, the guitar is just amazing, is a mix of rhythm melody that reflects the soul of that song.  ",
