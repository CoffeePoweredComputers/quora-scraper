            "answer_text": "I spent a lot of time thinking about this. I thought about having some of my all time favorites, amazing songs like Nothing Else Matters- Metallica, or Sweet Child O\u2019 Mine- Guns N' Roses, or even Helter Skelter- The Beatles. Just real classics that I have and will always love. But then I realized that though those songs are amazing, they're not really me at all. Then I thought about using a song that actually emotionally helped me like Hey Jude-The Beatles, Built This Way-Samantha Rosum, or I'm With You- Avril Lavigne. But then I realized though these are empowering songs, I don't at all want them to describe my life. After that I thought about focusing on something about me, and I love air guitarring to songs in my bedroom, I do it everyday, so I thought about Smells Like Teen Spirit, Mr. Brightside, and I Was Made for Lovin\u2019 You- KISS. I mean it's a part of my life, a huge part of it, and as a tv show would focus in about my life, it should have been perfect! Right? Something didn't feel right, and I had an epiphany, I needed a song that was built into the core of me, a song that I grew up listening to. That was the perfect criteria and I found two perfect songs, that would be a sin for me to choose between. Both are also themselves theme songs: I Found a Way and Leave it All to Me. If you don't know what tv shows they belong to or who sang them then I just cannot talk to you, don't comment asking what they are, just go in a dark corner, preferably with spiders and cobwebs, and rethink your life choices (But if you're older than 30 I guess I can forgive you). For those of you teenagers and millenials who do know it, you probably grew up with these songs as well. Leave it all to me has the perfect lyrics and I Found a Way has the perfect beat (okay not perfect but cut them some slack, it's a kids tv show it can't be The Beatles level perfect). These were the roots of my childhood, and I cannot imagine two other songs that could represent me in a better way. ",
