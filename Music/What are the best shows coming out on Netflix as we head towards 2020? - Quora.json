Breaking Bad is a few high-school chemistry teachers who slowly descends into evil by cooking meth to buy his cancer treatments. Breaking Bad might be the simplest television program on Netflix, and a few would argue it is the best one ever made. Bryan Cranston\u2019s portrayal of Walter White is one of the purest acting performances ever, TV or otherwise. A superb supporting cast, including Aaron Paul, who is nearly as good as White\u2019s meth producing partner Jesse Pinkman. The Crown  Image source: vogue The Crown may be a well-made and one among the foremost expensive made shows. It consists of standout performances in its first two seasons from Claire Foy as Queen Elizabeth and Matt Smith as Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Olivia Colman and Tobias Menzies will take over for them, beginning with Season 3. Its period ensembles are Legendary and its sets planned with faultless tender care. If solitary, The Crown would pick its likely storylines as carefully! Nevertheless, The Crown is confident in its soapiness, wealth in every aspect. And possibly Netflix\u2019s most suitable option for escapism. If you\u2019re keen on royalist porn or British period dramas like Downton Abbey, this may be sort of a long, slow massage. 13 Reasons Why  Image Source: vox In view of the top-rated book by Jay Asher, 13 Reasons Why follows youth Earth Jensen as he gets back from school to locate a secretive box together with his name thereon lying on his patio.

            "answer_text": "LUCIFER (2015) Length: 4 seasons, Genre: Drama/Crime/Fantasy Fiction for some, Religion for others! Losing the red horn and pitchfork for debonair skin, the titular entity roams our world with wealth and taste. Lucifer is a quirky, somewhat mischievous take on the fallen angel.  It has many pop references, cool soundtracks and more importantly, a smooth convincing acting from the lead actor Tom Ellis. Far from menacing, Lucifer is a magnetic gentleman. He wears nice suits, talks in charming accent and is very manipulative. The way he is displayed here hinges a lot on persuasion. He oozes confident, able to affect others with ease but without being overly callous or arrogant. Tom Ellis just struts as though he embraces the characters, the confidence is nearly infectious. Lucifer\u2019s production has all sort of nifty flair. Visual utilizes light tone, it gives more cinematic feel than most series, probably to portray the larger than life persona. Soundtracks are very good, the music is a mix of pop, rock and rap, which will resonate with audience in youthful fashion.  The best part: Characters are pretty inviting, and it's not just about Lucifer himself. Supporting roles play good parts too, the female police looks sympathetic enough for long term strange partnership, almost in odd buddy cop gimmick. It leaves many possibilities for future episodes, maybe it ventures into case of the week or just expanding on how manipulative Lucifer can be without becoming too sinister for silver screen.  I especially like the character Amenadiel, so new, so deep. The supporting cast have better and unique stories than Lucifer himself. Not sure how long Lucifer will walk the TV , Netflix just announced season 5 to be aired in 2020 and it will not be the finale. Either way this series is done with great taste. Lucifer is fascinatingly classy and with a touch of devilry, please give Lucifer the courtesy of your viewing. ",
