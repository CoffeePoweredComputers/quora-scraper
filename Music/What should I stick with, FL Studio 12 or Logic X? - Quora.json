            "answer_text": "Alright, So first things first, Every Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) is great in some or the other way. Name any digital audio workstation software and I\u2019m here to say why that digital audio workstation is better than the others in the market. Hence, Pick one and Just Stick to any digital audio workstation. It doesn\u2019t really matter which DAW you are using. Just start using one and get started. The DAW which you would use is the best. Lamborghini is a better car manufacturing brand than Mercedes. But if you don\u2019t know how to drive a car, the car which you would buy doesn\u2019t really matter right? The same thing goes with DAW. Choose any DAW but make use of it the best way possible. Make amazing music with it, and thats what the whole point is! Now, Coming to your question on which one to choose: FL studio or Apple Logic Pro X. Then you must think about a lot of stuff. Compatibility: Fl studio is only compatible with Windows Desktops Apparently, it is also compatible with macs but I can\u2019t comment on that, whereas Apple logic Pro X is only for Mac users. Now, undoubtedly, Macs are the most powerful machine out there in the market. But really? You would buy a Mac to run Apple logic X pro in it which would cost you a few more bucks? Also, Mac OSx have the least compatibility in terms of softwares. So unless you have a Mac already, I would recommend you to go for a High Spec Windows PC and run FL studio on it, Why? Because of the Compatibility of Windows with other Software and plugins.Workflow: FL Studio by far has the best user interface. Its Instrument Step sequencer, which is also known as the piano roll is on of the most intuitive and flexible tool. The FL Studio DAW utilizes drag and drop, and can generally be learned quickly without any prior knowledge. All the stock plugins look really nice and really show users what is being done, it's a great way to learn mixing theory for a beginner. This approach makes FL Studio easy to learn compared to other DAWs. Perfect for engineering because of the production style workflow. The workflow for creating beats in FL Studio is among the fastest which make mixing and mastering a breeze inserting plug-ins and routing on the mixer. Now talking about Apple logic X pro, I must say that it has one of the most tedious and counter Intuitive Design and user interface. The DAW will not give you any inspiration on music because of the fact that you dont know how to use the DAW itself. Where as FL studio is easy to learn, so you will spend less time learning the DAW and more time making music.PROs of FL STUDIO:Free Lifetime Updates with the basic Producer editionFL Studio has a very unique sampler which allows all kinds of sounds to be experimented with, be it a siren, a water drop. The Sampler also allows you to re-tune a sample to any key you desiresFully vectorial UI that will scale to virtually every screen, Because most DAWs don't scale well yet.Supports re-sampling, Supports re-sampling (non stretch) which is something Apple logic pro doesn't support.Accepts VST/VSTi (v2,v3) Wav, Aiff, Rex, Acid, Apple Loop, Ogg, Mp3 as well as almost every video format including Mov and Mp4.The only DAW with a VJ graphic generation suite (ZG Editor Visualizer), No other DAW has that.PROs of the APPLE LOGIC X PRO:High quality instruments and effects preloaded, Good range of high quality synths: analog, FM, wavetable, string modulation, sampler, organ, clarinet, e-piano.Now the Fl studio also comes with preloaded plugins which may not be as high grade as Apple Logic X but it all comes to the type of plugins you use. Use the NI Kontakt and you have got some amazing high quality samples. Use Nexus and Sylenth1 to get the best sounding Electronic Synth sounds.Comes with 32gb content, the DAW automatically downloads 30gb of samples once the Logic Pro X DAW is installed. Now, again there are many Sample packs on the web which would provide you high quality sounds for freeCons Of FL STUDIO and APPLE LOGIC X: The Mac Version of FL STUDIO is in Beta Version. So It wont run on Mac OSX. FL Studio is compatible with LINUX Whereas the Apple Logic X pro is only compatible with MAC OSX. FL studio is prone to crash, So you need to save your project before doing some major changes in your project. Apple Logic X pro has a really poor Audio Editor. You will never get the flexibility of Edison (FL STUDIO\u2019s Sound editor) in APPLE LOGIC PRO. Apple logic X pro does not support 32bit plugins and many good sounding free plugins are available in 32 bit format only. Now considering that you have a mac: So, If you have a Mac, then keeping the above things in mind I would recommend you to Install Windows 10 on your Mac using BOOT CAMP and then installing Fl studio on it. This will give you the power of a mac and the awesomeness and flexibility of Fl studio. So stick with Fl Studio. But again, I must say different producers have different taste of User Interface, Many like FL studio, Many like Ableton, Many like Apple logic X PRO. So, it all depends on which is the most suited for you. ",

            "answer_text": "Fl Studio is emerging as the top contender due to their commitment towards updates and upgrades. If your computer can handle it, its the best option, specifically way more user-friendly than logic X. If ur pC struggles then u should switch to other alternatives, as DAWs are a big threat to hardware, with recurrent complaints of crashing and overheating of RAM. Logic X is a safer and stable alternative, but again the future belongs to Fl! ",
