            "answer_text": "Untrained singers often wander from one key to another in the same song. Without accompaniment, they don't notice it. With music, some realize they sound \u201cbad\u201d when they wander into a new key because the musicians or recorded track don't wander with them and notes clash. Some people cannot keep a steady tempo when singing. If the song is in 4/4 time, then there are four beats to the measure and the quarter note gets the beat. It's mathematical. \u201c1, 2, 3. 4\u201d steadily tapping along if one can keep time or if one has someone like a drummer to project the time to a group. When there is no music, a person can easily add a little extra to a note\u2019s value and \u201c1\u201d becomes 1.25 or 1.5 or even 2.0. They might not hold notes long enough so instead of a steady 4 beats they have sung 3.5 beats which becomes quite noticeable after a couple of measures when the singer would be ahead of a recorded track by one full beat. It would sound a bit like a stutter with the singer starting a new phrase then a beat later the accompaniment playing it. The error in the math of keeping time can occur with the \u201crests\u201d when the singer should be pausing between sung notes as well. When singing to recorded music, the math doesn't lie. The singer can hopefully hear when they go too fast or slow or if they cheat the value of a note or add to it. Some singers miss the pitch. A tuned instrument like a piano will make bad pitch by a singer more obvious. It's mathematical also. Pitches have certain frequencies, so if a person is a little (or a lot) too high or low, their voice will clash with the other instruments instead of complementing the notes they produce. This is why you will hear orchestras tuning up before a concert begins. They are making their instruments match the frequency played by the concert master for a certain note. Otherwise, you might hear nine violins together and one that sounds not quite with everyone else. It would be quite unpleasant. ",

            "answer_text": "Most people feel this way, I think. Sometimes it is just because the person singing is a bad singer. :) But here is something interesting to think about\u2026 iTunes has something like 25,000,000 songs. Spotify has something like 30,000,000. How many of those do you listen to? A very, very small fraction of that. Even if your music library has 10,000 songs, that is still way smaller than 1% of all the music out there. And not only are those 1,000 songs well-produced enough and popular enough to end up on your playlist, they are the ones you liked. You are singing along with the best takes, the best edits a sound engineer could craft, and some of the best voices on planet earth (sometimes with the best auto-tuning). It\u2019s like constantly comparing your painting skills to Da Vinci or Rembrandt. No wonder you sound different! Try singing around a campfire sometime. For most of human history, that is what the average song sounded like. I bet you\u2019d sound pretty great in that setting. :) ",
