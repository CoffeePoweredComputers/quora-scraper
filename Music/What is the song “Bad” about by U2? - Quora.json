            "answer_text": "The hours I spent playing this song when I was a teenage bass player in a garage band. Hours. I don\u2019t like U2, but I concede that \u2018Bad\u2019 has a certain gawky, two-chord grandeur which can be very effective. (It actually has four chords: two of them are reserved for a moment of maximum drama.) I believe the general consensus among the U2 community is that \u2018Bad\u2019 is about heroin addiction, which in the mid-80s was quite a scourge in U2\u2019s stomping ground of north Dublin. Beyond that, it\u2019s deliberately vague, but in 80s rock generally, it\u2019s an interesting moment of rare compassion. Let\u2019s do a commentary, shall we? If you twist and turn away. If you tear yourself in two again. There\u2019s a singer, and there\u2019s a \u2018you\u2019, and I believe the song constructs the singer as the observer, the \u2018you\u2019 as a friend or lover who is an addict. If I could, yes I would, If I could, I would let it go. The singer empathises with \u2018your\u2019 desire to \u2018let it go\u2019, but whether this means letting of life or of drugs is left ambiguous. Surrender, dislocate. This sounds to me like a warning: If you surrender, you will \u2018dis-locate\u2019\u2014leave the world you\u2019re in, become broken. If I could throw this lifeless life-line to the wind. This line is rather too pleased with its own mysteriousness, but I think the meaning becomes clear from the succeeding lines. Leave this heart of clay, see you walk, walk away Into the night, and through the rain Into the half light and through the flame. If I could, through myself, set your spirit free I'd lead your heart away, see you break, break away Into the light and to the day. In other words, the singer wants to be able to free \u2018you\u2019 from the addiction \u2018through myself\u2019, so that the person will no longer be in such torment. I don\u2019t think this bit is about dying: I think it\u2019s about getting clean, but it\u2019s ambiguous enough (\u2018set your spirit free\u2019, \u2018into the light\u2019 etc.) that it could also be about death being the release from pain. To let it go and so to find away. To let it go and so find away. I'm wide awake. This is the point in the song where it builds to its first big turgid climax, the music boiling up underneath Bono\u2019s full-throated yelling: the way he sings \u2018find away-ay-ay\u2019 makes it sound like he\u2019s weeping. \u2018I\u2019m wide awake\u2019 is the singer keeping some sort of vigil at the side of the junkie, I think. I'm wide awake, wide awake. I'm not sleeping. This is the bit where the poor bass player (fourteen-year-old me) gets to stop rocking back and forth between A and D and finally goes up to G, then down to E, D and A again. The addict in the song is perhaps weathering a crisis. If you should ask, then maybe They'd tell you what I would say True colours fly in blue and black Blue silken sky and burning flag. Colours crash, collide in blood-shot eyes. Yeah\u2026not sure what this is about, unless it\u2019s Bono getting all poetic about track-marks and the visible signs of heroin addiction. If I could, you know I wouldIf I could, I would let it go. Now comes the instrumental bit, in which The Edge leans into his delay pedal. This desperation, dislocation Separation, condemnation Revelation, in temptation Isolation, desolation In performance, our singer, a dedicated U2 fan, would almost always keep this going a bit longer with Masturbation, constipation, railway station, urination and anything else he could think of. Let it go and so to find awayTo let it go and so to find away To let it go and so to find away I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake, wide awake I'm not sleeping Oh no, no, no. And so the tumescent music finally dies down and goes ping-y again, and the light dawns over the tower blocks and the addict is either dead or\u2026y\u2019know, not. So, that, I think, is the sound of \u2018Bad\u2019. In a sense, it\u2019s U2\u2019s \u2018TB Sheets\u2019: a harrowed meditation at the bedside of a sick loved one. That said, Bono in 2011 informed a Pittsburgh audience that the song was written for \u2018a very special man\u2019 who was actually at the concert. The man in question was Andy Rowen, brother of Peter Rowen, the kid on the cover of Boy and War. Andy Rowen was in Parnell Street, Dublin in 1974 when a bomb planted by loyalist terrorists went off nearby. He was eleven years old at the time, and the resulting PTSD caused him to have all sorts of substance abuse issues in later life. He survived, however, and when last heard was living in the USA and had found Jesus.  Make of that what you will. (Sources: ANDY ROWEN'S STORY Bad (U2 song) - Wikipedia) ",
