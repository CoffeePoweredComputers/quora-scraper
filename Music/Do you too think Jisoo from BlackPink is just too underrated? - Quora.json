            "answer_text": "Question: Do you think Jisoo from Blackpink is just too underrated? I don't think Jisoo from Blackpink is underrated at all. Let's look at this for a moment.  1)Her Instagram  As you can see, out of all the girls Jisoo does have the least amount of followers but she still has a lot of you compare it to other idols. I've also noticed that there's very few Jisoo stans on Instagram. Even though she has the least out of Blackpink, she still has a huge following considering the fact that she doesn't post much and she has less fans on Instagram. 2)Her popularity has gained massively since debut era This just comes from my observations but during debut Jisoo has a lot more popularity now than say around the time when Boombayah or Whitsle era. 2.1) Improvement in dancing ability and live stability Jisoo used to be mediocre at singing and her dancing was stiff and I think she just seemed boring to the public. She was criticized a lot but over the years, she really improved in her dancing and she's the most stable member now. Not to mention, a lot of people are appreciating her lovely deep voice. 2.2)Her genuine personality I personally really don't agree with people calling her the only real one in Blackpink but it's being said a lot nowadays. Over the years, many people have fallen for her silly, playful simple and fun personality and people call the rest of Blackpink fake and comment that they can't stand the rest of them. Which brings me to my next point - 2.3)Dislike towards the other members Around dx4 era, Jennie got massive hate for being lazy and unprofessional. She was also called 'rude' when she was on variety shows. Ros\u00e9 became the target of MR removed videos and she also got a lot of backlash for being very unstable singing live. Lisa is still really popular but aot of people claimed she was overrated as a dancer and rapper. Jennie, Ros\u00e9 and Lisa all got hate for using too much aegyo and being apperently \u2018fake\u2019. 3)She's definitely the most popular outside the blink fandom         I didn't reveal the usernames or profile picture s of any off the people who wrote these comments but I can assure that they were all people from different fandoms. As you can see, even by people who hate on Blackpink, they admit that Jisoo is the most loved outside the blink fandom and there are a lot of people who are part of other fandoms but they solo stan Jisoo. There are so many more comments but I can't put them all here or it'd be a book.  So based on everything I've said, I'd conclude that Jisoo is not underrated. While she's the least popular out of Blackpink, her popularity is growing at a rapid rate and her talents are being recognised. Like I've said, she's the most popular Blackpink member outside of the fandom too.  -ch\u00e9rry ",

I think Ros\u0117 is underrated and unfairly attacked over her voice and not fully appreciated for her dancing. I think Jennie is often rudely treated (except for that unacceptable lapse of laziness). And Lisa is too often the subject of \u201cis she better at dancing than Momo,\u201d even though I've taken part in that myself. But Jisoo is dead on. She is clearly the least when in comes to Blackpink's dancing, though she's gotten better. I think she is the least in the vocal line, but that doesn't make her bad. In fact, I LOVE her voice. It's deep and different and fits perfectly with the group. I heard her crack badly during a concert, but nobody's flawless, so whatever. The thing is, she tries hard. With so many English speakers in their group, she doesn't need to make effort there, but she tries anyway. Her dancing improvements means she tries. And she is easily the funniest on the team, so her charisma is tight. She gets no hate there. And she's the prettiest. There's that.  On top of it all, she has repeatedly acted as a team leader on a team that has no leader. Maybe she gets no respect for that. No, I think Jisoo is appreciated for all the right things and I see her getting few criticisms. Jisoo might be the one member who flies lowest below the radar. Thanks for reading. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually that's what everybody thinks because she is not loved by the blinks (Blackpink\u2019s Fandom) she is the one who is overshadowed by her bandmates and the company outright forgets about her.  But she is not underrated because she actually has the biggest number of solo stans outside of the fandom. She loved by all! Everyone likes hating on Blackpink but they refrain from saying anything bad about Jisoo.  Non blinks hate on Jennie for all the so called \u201cscandals\u201d that she has had. Korean are racist to Lisa and many antis hate on her over hyped dancing. Every anti hates Rose\u2019s voice and say she has bad technique. But most antis like Jisoo and rather praise her for her skills and improvement and visuals. My explanation to this phenomenon is that since Jisoo is over looked by most blinks (ot 3) so most anti blinks relate to her and see her as their own. Remember most people hate upon Blackpink because they either got bullied by blinks or blinks attacked their favourites. So when blinks hate upon Jisoo this people feel like they have to protect her. On top of that the other members are of Blackpink don't do very well in variety shows but Jisoo excels in them so many are also drawn to her. So to answer your question no Jisoo is not underrated. Her fans are just outside of the fandom (blinks). \ud83d\ude07\u270c\ufe0f BTW not a blink and I might be wrong about the above stated answer blinks feel free to correct me if you can \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude0a ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Underrated. Underappreciated. Heck Blinks are too blind to not see a woman so talented as Jisoo. I am not a blink. I am big believer that BP is overrated. I followed K-pop way back from the Sechskies. I have been through groups like 2NE1 SNSD, who are the monster girl groups of K-pop. And BP is nowhere near them. Their stage presence is overhyped. But in midst of all this Jisoo appears calm and quiet. She is overshadowed by those OT3 blinks who continue to shower praises on the foreign members. Sure Jennie raps like fire sometimes but compare her to CL or even Soyeon, she wouldn't stand a chance. Lisa dances great, but so do others. Rose's voice is good, but it's way of track and she sounds like a chipmunk who is dying many times. I'm not saying that Jisoo doesn't have any faults, but stop making her be the extra addition only for her visuals. She looks great and sings better live than all three of them compared. She has more fans from other fandoms than from Blinks themselves. So yeah, I feel she is underrated. But then again, these days she is more noticed. And it's not that she changed or anything, it's that fans are finally realizing how talented she is. Jisoo doesn't need the other members to make her look bad. Heck she makes them look bad in those MR Removed videos. I wish she was appreciated more though. ",

            "answer_text": "You seem to be one of those 12-year-old Blinks who think that Jisoo gets mistreated and whatnot by YG. Before moving on, let me make this clear for you: she isn\u2019t. If Jisoo was mistreated, she would be unhappy. And if she was unhappy, it would show in her Vlives and photos. Jisoo is happy, which means that Jisoo is not being mistreated \u2014 or, at least, Jisoo doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s being mistreated. And if Jisoo doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s being mistreated, you should stop whining about it. (What, did you really thing that YG was going to see that comment you wrote on a Youtube video demanding more lines for Jisoo? You wish.) Furthermore, when you say \u201cunderrated\u201d, you mean that people aren\u2019t appreciating her \u201ctrue value\u201d. However, Jisoo\u2019s \u201ctrue value\u201d varies from person to person, because each person sees her differently. In my eyes, she\u2019s just another Kpop idol. But in yours, she may mean the world. Can you force me to think differently? No, but you can try to show me why you think that she\u2019s so amazing. I don\u2019t want to be forced to like Jisoo. I want to like Jisoo on my own accord. The only reason why I can\u2019t appreciate any of her qualities is because so many people try to push them onto me, and it was to the point where I just completely lost interest in Blackpink (as a group) and decided to solely support Jennie. Not everyone will see Jisoo the same way you do. Get used to it.  ",

            "answer_text": "Hi thank for asking. So here is what I think YES definitely. JISOO FROM BLACKPINK IS UNDERRATED. I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD HEAR: THIS KIM JISOO IS UNDERRATED. According to me,she is VERY talented. Or I should say one of the MOST talented in Blackpink. I am definitely not saying that the other cuties aren't or that Jisoo is better than them. They definitely ARE VERY TALENTED. But Jisoo is just something else. Here's why I think people should stop sleeping on her: SHE IS VERY PRETTY:She is the VISUAL of the group but still her beauty is not noticed because SHE IS NEVER TAKEN SERIOUSLY\u2026..NEVER. In the choreographies,she is always placed behind or she gets only some seconds in front due her lines or just because she isn't the BEST dancer.I HATE THAT!SHE HAS A BEAUTIFUL VOICE: Jisoo has a beautiful and kinda husky and AMAZING voice. But then again \u2026 NO LINES. And when we ask why this is what we get \u2026 'Oh she is the visual and visuals aren't supposed to that many lines'. Well I think they are a LOT of groups out there whose visuals have lines. ATLEAST MORE THAN WHAT JISOO GETS.SHE HAS IMPROVED A LOOOT IN DANCING:Yes SHE HAS IMPROVED A LOT. Take a look at Forever Young's dance practice. A lot of people say that she has improved and SHE HAS IMPROVED. BTW, NOT EVERYONE IS A BORN DANCER. She might not be GREAT but she is better than MANY. (I am seriously NOT pointing at ANY idol and no one from BLACKPINK especially.)SHE IS THE MOST STABLE WHILE SINGING ON STAGE COMPARED TO THE OTHER GIRLS: Again, all of them are good but while singing live IT HAS TO BE JISOO. I know you might say that the girls were tired or it is difficult and I know and completely understand. But it is true JISOO IS THE MOST STABLE WHILE SINGING LIVE. You can see it for yourself, watch a BLACKPINK MR removed performance.Now,for the people who say that she is the visual so people already look at her \u2026\u2026 NO \u2026 why do you think people would look at her when SHE IS ALWAYS BEHIND,ALWAYS GETS JUST 4 LINES OR MAYBE LESS THAN THAT OR HALF THE TIME SHE HAS TO REPEAT THE SAME LINE OVER AND OVER AGAIN???HOW???  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS??? WHERE IS JISOO??? YUP BEHIND JENNIE. Its not that they only had this formation in that beautiful choreography\u2026 but still nO JiSoO. Why? She is the visual right? People already look at her right??? WELL NO THEY DON'T. AND THAT'S WHY KIM JISOO IS UNDERRATED AND I HATE THAT. She is ALSO a part of BLACKPINK. She ALSO was trained WITH the girls but stillll SHE IS NOT TAKEN SERIOUSLY JUST BECAUSE SHE WON'T SAY ANYTHING.I AM NOT SAYING THIS WAS JISOO'S BEST BUT SHE WAS BETTER THAN THE OTHER GIRLS. AND THEN THIS ONE DOWN \u2026.  is something you can watch if you don't believe that Jisoo's vocals are beautiful. SO DEAR FRIENDS, TREAT HER PROPERLY BECAUSE SHE IS NEITHER A JOKE NOR A BED ON WHICH YOU GUYS CAN SLEEP. THANK YOU. Hope this helped. I know you might find better answers but \u2026 I tried my best. Hehehe. (BTW,Jisoo is not my bias. I am an OT4 stan. I love all of them equally.) Byeee. -Lara ",

            "answer_text": "Not only Jisoo, but I also feel Rose is also underrated. Rose in korea and Jisoo internationally. Like the vocal line of blackpink just aint hyped or as known as the rap line. They are both drop dead gorgeous but are always ignored by many blinks in the blinks nation. Rose is only praised by her unique voice and slender body and has been attacked lately that her voice is too annoying and her visuals aint good enough for blackpink, and Jisoo is usually labelled as the useless visual and the black hole of blackpink which really hurts the rose and jisoo stans. One reason behind the vocal line being underrated could be due to the fact that they do not have the \u201cswag\u201d Jennie and Lisa has, and instead look like that girl next door, or the pretty face. Especially Jisoo is always overlooked, because people assume that she is that \u201cboring mom\u201d of the group, who is shallow. BUT BISH THEY COULD NEVER BE THIS WRONG. Jisoo\u2019s 4D personality is basically BTS\u2019s V\u2019s, and lately people have been taking notice of it, so thats a good thing. Also, Rose\u2019s dancing skills are usually outshined by Lisa\u2019s. Of course Lisa is the dancing machine and our main dancer, but people tend to forget that Rose is the lead dancer who also has her own style of dancing.SO YEAH HOPE THESE TWO LOVELY LADIES GET MORE RECOGNITION ",

She\u2019s actually quite popular here in Korea, but not so much internationally. This is probably because she\u2019s the only member that can\u2019t speak English very well. For this reason fans seem to just push her away and give all the love to the other members. And she really does try her best to connect with international fans.  I came across this video, and it was really sad to watch. I\u2019m not even the biggest Blackpink fan but the least you can do is acknowledge her presence. They don\u2019t seem to think about how she feels in these situations. And what I find weird is that this isn\u2019t the case with other groups. Namjoon is the only fluent English speaker in BTS, yet the other members get plenty of love internationally. I don\u2019t know if it has something to do with Blackpink\u2019s fandom, but to me it doesn\u2019t make much sense. Hopefully in the future more Blinks come to realize that the language barrier doesn\u2019t make Jisoo any less of a member. ",

Just because Jisoo is the least popular in within the group, doesn\u2019t mean that she is underrated. She is widely regarded as one of the best visuals in kpop from both Korean fans and International fans. For an idol to be underrated, I think they need to be quite talented yet not that popular. Jisoo is the opposite: she isn\u2019t overly talented nor is she unpopular. Her strong suit is her visuals, which are highly praised. Her vocals are solid but she gets even more hype from Blinks. Her dancing is negligible and she doesn\u2019t rap. So overall, Jisoo isn\u2019t the most talented idol. I think people are getting this \u201cJisoo is underrated\u201d sentiment because she often gets the least lines in Blackpink songs. However, Blackpink songs for the most part have decent line distributions, especially compared to other groups. In conclusion, Jisoo is not underrated. ",

            "answer_text": "Well i am not much into Blackpink but i think i can answer your question . As we all know the most famous members of Blackpink are Jennie and Lisa. Well it depends upon where you are situated. Apparently Lisa is more popular in Asia and Jennie among Westerners. Next would be Rose as she can speak English well apart from Jennie, she would be the next member whom people are able to recognise. Lastly we have Jisoo who isn't as popular as the other members. Not that she is untalented but just that the other members are more popular . I have listened to some of their songs ( like i said i am not into Blackpink much), and i actually like Jisoo\u2019s voice. Its very unique and she sounds stable while live performances. She is not bad at dancing too and she can hold herself well. But as she is not very popular you could say that she is very underrated. She just doesn't get to shine much as compared to the other members. ",

And blackpink has garnered attention from the world, so there would be no one who knows Blackpink but doesn't know jisoo, or her abilities. In fact, my most of friends who listen to blackpink prefer jisoo and lisa more than ros\u00e9 and jennie. Jisoo's vocals are better than anyone else in the group. Just my opinion. Sometimes, things go overrated in the name of being underrated. ",

She isn't clinche and the only true person in bp. She's funny,adorable and doesn't has fake personality like rest of three. Though I'm not a fan of bp and have listened to few of their songs but I've heard many ex-blinks saying these things. So,I decided to check it out and yes,they were right. I think if bp will someday disband,Jisoo will have most successful career because she has ability to pull off multiple concepts. ",
