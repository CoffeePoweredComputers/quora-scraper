            "answer_text": "Singing live is really hard, especially if there's a lot of dance moves or activity involved. I was at her concert, and she definitely sang a lot of songs completely live; to be clear, these were usually slower songs, often acoustic, and she wasn't dancing. The lip syncing happened during the faster songs that had dancing, like \"Shake It Off.\" I'm totally okay with this tradeoff. I don't expect anyone to be able to sing well and dance vigorously at the same time, this would be really hard to do from a cardiovascular perspective. Another example of this tradeoff is Beyonce's Superbowl show. She insisted on singing live, but her tradeoff is that anytime she was dancing a lot, she wasn't singing. ",
