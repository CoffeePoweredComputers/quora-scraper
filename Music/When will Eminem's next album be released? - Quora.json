            "answer_text": "This might actually happen sooner than we think. Here\u2019s why. In the past when Em released freestyles and cyphers it has been a warmup for something else. For example when CXVPHER dropped it was just about 2 weeks before the release of ShadyXV. This also happened with the Southpaw freestyle when it got dropped the day before the Southpaw Soundtrack. Now about 2 weeks ago he dropped Campaign Speech and if the pattern repeats itself, we should probably hear something very soon. Also the A&R for both Joe Budden and Royce has hinted at a single releasing very soon. Although this can\u2019t be confirmed, the ties to shady records makes it a very real possibility. Hopefully we hear something in the next week from a more reliable source. My guess would be that if a single were to drop anytime soon, it would be on election day to continue with the campaign speech theme. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A.....Yeah, even I had heard of this news, may be it's simply a rumour but I had heard that Eminem is going to launch his new album this year 2016.....actually the reason for this rumour or so-called news of launching his new album was that you might have known that Eminem recently went for a show trip, and this show trip he had planned out from his very busy schedule.....'Busy Schedule'-Eminem is busy, so that means He was working on something; and so much hard work he only does for music and songs...so from this fact we can assume that may be Eminem is going to launch his new album. I wish only one thing that if it would be his last album, then It should be like any one of those 'Slim Shady LP', 'Marshall Mathers LP', 'The Eminem Show', these three albums are really classis, fantastic, and superv, and also some songs if had the taste of chopping style it wouldn't be going too bad. Lets Hope for the best, this We fans can do...... Thanks!!!!!!!!! ",
