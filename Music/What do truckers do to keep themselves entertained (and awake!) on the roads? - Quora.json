            "answer_text": "Books on Tape, back 20 years ago all on cassette tape, longer books had 6\u20138 cassettes. I drove team with my Wife, and it is amazing how much we would get into these books, miles would fly by. When I drove solo, for me anyway it was very loud hard rock, and singing to it at the top of my lungs!! I sleep drove better than most, not to make light of it, it sucked, and was extremely deadly to myself and others. But it was a fact of driving for me driving solo. I would try loud music, windows down in below zero temps, slap the shit out of myself etc. One trip across Hwy 666 in New Mexico on a 2 lane stretch I woke up, looked around, saw a State Trooper beside me in the opposing lane? By the time it woke me fully he passed me the rest of the way. I have no clue how long he was there before I woke up, but he was there for a mile or so after I was alert, only saw him bend down to where he could see me once. It scared me awake till I parked it. Another trip hauling a milk tanker non-stop from Maryland I woke up almost to malfunction junction (I-75 and I-4) in Tampa, the first thing I saw were huge wide open eyes and mouths looking back at me from the Van I was coming up on at about 100 mph, I nailed the brakes, avoiding hitting them, I was still pretty out of it but also scared to death and full of adrenalin. Never had an at fault accident, and after my Wife hit the road with me never had the sleep issues as bad. And did not have to push the way I had driving solo, can not imagine the guilt and horror if I would have hurt or killed others. Sorry so long, memories flooded in when I started answering the original question. ",

            "answer_text": "You can park the truck and get out and run around it a couple of times. This will get the adrenaline going and help you wake up for awhile. This is time consuming because it requires stopping the truck and parking which is bad. If you don't have time to sleep you probably don't have I'm to stop and park just to jog around the truck. But it is very effective in waking the body up. The next staying awake hack is to slap yourself firmly across the face. You\u2019lI have to do it several times on both sides of the face to get a good waking up effect. Don't be wimpy about this. If you want to be a truck driver you better get used to beating yourself up. Finally, I purchased a thermos bottle that plugged into the cigarette lighter. It will keep water scolding hot. For this hack I would recommend wearing shorts while driving. Simply take a couple ounces of the scolding hot water and pour it across your thigh. This will keep you awake for hours. If those don't work you better find another line of work. They are always hiring truck drivers in the septic tank service industry but you have to be able to take a lot of shit. ",

For long nights, when it\u2019s dark and the road is straight ahead, I used almonds. I would eat one almond at a time; hold it in your teeth and explore the texture with your tongue, then bite it in half at the long seam and feel the difference between the smooth inside and the rough outside. Really concentrate on that almond. Then using only your front teeth bite the almond into tiny pieces, see how small you can make them. Chew it up and move on to almond #2 If that\u2019s not working, try doing the same thing while holding another almond between your molars and cheek. The idea is to keep your mind focused, radio doesn\u2019t do it. Even talk radio, audiobooks, or podcasts let your mind wander, you need to have a single thought in your head. ",
