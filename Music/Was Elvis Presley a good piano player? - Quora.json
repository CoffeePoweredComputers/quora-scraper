            "answer_text": "I seem to remember reading that Elvis was actually a better piano player than he was a guitar player. During the Million Dollar quartet sessions Elvis played piano even though Jerry Lee Lewis was there because even that early on in their careers Elvis was considered a better piano player. As much of an Elvis fan that I am I don\u2019t think Elvis was great at playing either the guitar (that is known) or the piano. he could competently get by to accompany himself but that\u2019s about it.
