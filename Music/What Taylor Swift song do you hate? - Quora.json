ME! this song is terrible. i feel embarrassed by this song. it\u2019s cheesy, colorful, and childish. and i can\u2019t believe Taylor wrote this song when she was 29? what does this song even mean? why does Taylor write this kiddy song? i don\u2019t know\u2026 bad blood i like the live version of bad blood. but i don\u2019t like the song (the studio version) for some reasons. bad blood is a terrible song that she used to aim at Katy Perry for stealing Taylor\u2019s dancers\u2026 and it\u2019s also NOT who Taylor is. i love Taylor and her music, but these 3 songs are NOT them. they are not good.
