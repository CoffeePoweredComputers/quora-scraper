            "answer_text": "Is music more interesting than art? I don\u2019t think so. Music is most immediately compelling. In part, sound and rhythm are powerful experiences for people and music is created in ways that put those together in highly immediate experiences. And, some music has lyrics which adds poetics to heighten the interest - to literally reflect situations and feelings back to us along with sound and rhythm to strengthen that reflection. Art is more interesting over the long term. When I have a piece on my wall for 10 years, I spend that time pondering, looking, involved with it. It doesn\u2019t give me the immediacy. But think about it - if I played the same symphony every time I sat in the living room for 10 years I\u2019d be pretty damn sick of it (even if it were Beethoven). Yet I can walk by the same painting every day for 10 years and still be discovering things about it that I enjoy. That said, there is an error in contemporary art which has significantly dropped it\u2019s interest. When was the last time a piece of contemporary art reduced you to tears (great music does that easily)? When was the last time you were so moved by emotion in a piece of contemporary art that you can say it touched your should deeply? Much contemporary (and I DO MEAN contemporary - not \u201cmodern\u201d) art is so intellectualized and theorized that all emotion and soul have been left out. Much contemporary art is merely a meme in art\u2019s trappings (with big words and a big price tag). On the other hand, view Picasso\u2019s \u201cGuernica\u201d and be unmoved by the passion and pain it reflects. Or the calm beauty of Monet water lilies. Or\u2026 There remain many artists who created art from the soul. Hopefully, the \u201cart world\u201d will some day realize how lost it has become and return to demanding that art touch the soul. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say I fell in love with art even before than music. After diving into art and sailing only, I have caught the essence of music. Art just gives you a glance while music writes a theorem for it, your expressions and emotions. The reason for the gap: People found it easy and convenient to express through music than art. As we generally see, if one has to convey something through art, it is required to be perfect and distinctive cause even a change in shape or colour would affect the overall meaning, not to pull out laughter, a man would look like a woman. Better skills are required to be able to express as it is through art. Art many times is set with a meaning hidden, the texture, the shade, even a curve can describe a lot. Sometimes you need to have almost similar mind to capture it. Not everyone can understand at ease unlike music where only variant is language. Music even requires skill but it\u2019s a general ability to be able to talk and talk with harmony. So even at its worst, the urge is getting conveyed. On the other hand, if you are thinking of art as just a sketch or colour, you are mistaken, it\u2019s the whole design-body in itself. And many fields are inter-related to art.Probably a musician\u2019s name comes out first and then the artist cause the learning span is more for art. The outcome might take long, several years say, and so is it\u2019s worth! Nevertheless, we should consider saying them the twins or the same since they represent the creative fields. Just like different living beings, there is art and music, which has it\u2019s own, unique importance and mindset requirement :) ",
