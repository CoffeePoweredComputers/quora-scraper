            "answer_text": "Well, let's see what Clapton said about it, according to those who were there and heard him. And what Clapton's Cream band-mates thought as well. It\u2019s a story \u2026 When Hendrix had just come to England in fall, 1966 - brought over by the Animals' bassist and now-his-manager Chas Chandler -- and was playing in the after-hours clubs in London, word quickly got out about him. And the 'rock royalty' was soon coming to see him, including John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Brian Jones, Mick Jagger, Pete Townshend, Roger Daltry. Paul McCartney told of one such visit on the Late Night Show this past fall ... Roger Daltry talks about another in the documentary: Seven Ages Of Rock - 1 : The Birth of Rock - Video Dailymotion Daltry was with Townshend and Clapton when they saw Hendrix, and Roger said, \u201cEric\u2019s comment after Jimi played was, \u2018I\u2019m gonna f***er off and practice\u2019.\u201d The documentary then goes in to describe the time \u2014 also in this same period \u2014 when Hendrix actually jammed with Cream in a 1966 London gig. Jack Bruce, talking about it, said (in the same documentary), \u201cHe plugged into my bass amp \u2026 he did a version of Killing Floor (Howlin Wolf song - that supposedly, according to a reporter who was there, Clapton considered too hard to play) \u2026 blues all the way \u2026 he just played his ass off, basically. The first time I saw Eric I thought, \u2018Ah, master guitar player\u2019 \u2026 but Jimi was some force of nature.\u201d Ginger Baker added: \u201cEric just stands there and plays \u2026 we got this guy (Hendrix) and he\u2019s on his knees, and playing with his teeth \u2026\u201d Baker again: \u201cIt was like, WOW \u2026 I know it had a tremendous effect on Eric.\u201d Chas Chandler said: \u201cEric\u2019s hands are on the guitar \u2026 he just drops his hands, and he just stood there looking at Jimi \u2026 and he just walked off the stage \u2026 I ran back stage, and Eric was trying to light a cigarette \u2026 his hands were shaking \u2026 (mumbling) \u2018Is he really that good?\u2019\u201d (And BTW, Jeff Beck, for his part, said this about seeing Hendrix: \u201cIt was like a bomb going off in the right place \u2026 I couldn\u2019t do what he did .. I just went away from there thinking I better think of something else to do.\u201d  So ... here's the thing to me. A comparison. Clapton was (is) a true blue guitar virtuoso. As Jack Bruce said it, a Master Guitarist. Lightning fast, clean, and with elite musicality. He's an A+ Hendrix: (i) he was sloppier, because he didn't care about that. He cared about extending limits, pushing into new sounds and effects. Launching into new galaxies of guitar playing. (ii) as Jack Bruce said, Hendrix was a 'force of nature' -- a natural showman supreme. Whereas Clapton was/is no showman at all, really. (iii) I also always remember - this all seemed to come easy to Jimi, he was so supremely talented. So focusing on playing 'clean' wouldn\u2019ve been easy for him. (iv) Jimi was also a better, and more natural songwriter. Clapton often had co-writers for his songs IIRC, even if uncredited.  So ... who was better? To me it depends strictly on your 'cup of tea\u2019. If you're a blues purist, you're gonna prefer Clapton, probably - nothing wrong with that. Me? I take Jimi.  (Jimi, final tour (which I saw, tho not this stop \u2026 he made the same comment wrt \u201cWatchtower\u201d when I saw him) \u2026 here\u2019s \u201cVoodoo Child\u201d \u2026)  ",

            "answer_text": "Questions like this are rather odd to ask. It always seems like it is a question about someone\u2019s technical/physical ability, but practically everyone answers it with regard to the music and not with regard to technical proficiency on the instrument. You can talk about someone\u2019s technical/physical ability and proficiency objectively, but talking about music is a purely subjective matter. And talking about a purely subjective matter as though it were an objective and technical thing makes no sense. While there is a scholarly aspect to music, and you can dissect songs via musical theory, that\u2019s not really what is ever being considered with a question like this. From a technical/physical ability standpoint, frankly, Clapton isn\u2019t very good, and Hendrix isn\u2019t much better. They\u2019re adequate at \u201cplaying the guitar\u201d but neither is what you would call a virtuoso on the instrument, despite what most people might say. They\u2019re not incredibly technically proficient. I\u2019ve been casually playing the guitar for over 30 years, and neither am I. But anyone that\u2019s played the instrument for a considerable period of time knows what takes skill to play and what does not require very much skill, as they\u2019ve got some experience to make comparisons. If *I* can play something, it likely doesn\u2019t require much skill to play. I\u2019m a pretty average guitar player. And from a technical standpoint, nothing either guitarist ever released is difficult to play. Writing it is an entirely separate matter, and delves into that subjective side of things again. What most people usually say when this type of question is asked is actually referring to their music itself, which is a completely different matter. Some of their music, either one, might be considered incredibly beautiful by many people. But others may view it with indifference or disgust. You see, it\u2019s like asking someone \u201cWhich car is faster, the VW Beetle or the Bugatti Veyron?\u201d and someone trying to argue that the Beetle is obviously a way better looking car. So what? That person may love the way the Beetle looks, but that wasn\u2019t the question asked. Neither Clapton nor Hendrix were incredibly technically proficient on the guitar. Neither one had technical skills the average Joe couldn\u2019t achieve if they played the guitar for a few years. Musically, however, they obviously had a whole lot to offer or they wouldn\u2019t have achieved what they did. But that side of things is purely subjective. If you want to see some guitar players that are very proficient concerning the skills it takes to play the guitar I would suggest searching for stuff by Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, Yngwie Malmsteen, etc. Searching for \u201cguitar shredders\u201d will bring up a lot of names of guitar players who are absolutely amazing as far as technical skills go. Whether or not you will appreciate any of the music they play is a completely separate matter, as that\u2019s subjective. But from an objective point of view, guitarists generally known as \u201cgood shredders\u201d possess an insane amount of technical proficiency and physical ability, and are good \u201cguitar players.\u201d But for the millionth time, music is subjective. :) ",
