            "answer_text": "No. It\u2019s highly unlikely I\u2019d consider that. That\u2019s a bit extreme. But then, I don\u2019t know where in the world you live and nothing about events in the \u2018heated road rage\u2019 incident you refer to. If you were threatened, you should report the matter to the police. Tell them what happened. They\u2019ll give you suitable advice and if necessary take appropriate action. Unless you live in a small town, have a unique looking vehicle that stands out or have a personalised number plate (that\u2019s one disadvantage of having the latter) its unlikely the other party will remember your vehicle, or you. In the U.K. certainly, only specific organisations can identify the registered keeper of a vehicle - it\u2019s not something that\u2019s accessible to random members of the public. in the event you are on the road and find yourself being followed by the individual(s) you had the altercation, or anywhere else for that matter, and happen to be subject to any untoward interaction with them, again my advice is to call the police - using the emergency number if applicable if you feel better selling your car, do as you please ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a wonderful feature installed on all my cars known as a throttle pedal - it allows me to leave road ragers behind before an incident has any chance to become \u201cheated.\u201d If someone attempts to play catch-up, my cell phone is more than capable of contacting the police to report the incident, and if someone was foolish enough to invade my home space, they\u2019ll have to deal with my perpetually pissed off landlady, and easy identification based on the cameras blanketing both the complex parking lot, and my own home security cameras. I\u2019ve still had ragers go out of control - somewhere in my Quora history, there\u2019s a lovely story of a gent in a pickup truck attracting police attention and inadvertently saving me from a sizeable speed limit fine. But, in the case of someone exerting that much effort to get to my current dwelling, and managing to sidestep local law enforcement, a landlady capable of far more rage than I could ever muster, and a plethora of evidence collection devices surrounding my home, I\u2019ll happily watch them fruitlessly pound on my insanely thick wooden door while I inform the police that I have a donation to make, and request the deployment of stylish silver wrist jewelry to my location. No person would ever be able to muster enough rage to scare me enough to part with MY car. Nor would I have any desire to involve myself in an incident that could escalate to \u201cthreats\u201d when I have a perfectly good vehicle waiting to whisk me away to a road unencumbered. ",
