            "answer_text": "First, identify the genre/setting of music that you are listening to. To identify which instruments you are hearing, this is the first step. However, most instruments have a specific and unique range and timbre that makes it quite easy to identify. Let\u2019s use the full orchestra, for example. If I hear a singing, high-pitched whistling sound, I can tell that the instrument I\u2019m hearing is the piccolo. The full and robust brassy sounds come from the French horn, etc. The strings in an orchestra, however, are slightly more difficult to set apart, as their ranges often overlap. The high (soprano) voices of the strings are the violins, with the 1st violins playing the highest notes and the 2nd violins playing beneath them. The alto voice of the strings are the violas, which have different strings/tunings (tuned to A, G, D, and C instead of E, A, D, and G). The tenor voices are the cellos, and the basses are self-explanatory. In rock music, there is a much smaller variety of instruments, which most people are much more familiar with (and I believe is more relevant to your question). The strings, guitar and bass, are reasonably easy to identify. The keyboard player, however, can be harder to discern, as the keyboard has several different sounds that the player has at their disposal depending on their individual setup. In pop music, however, this is where things begin to get interesting. Pop music nowadays is mostly synthesizers/other MIDI instruments, which have a great many faces. If it sounds unnatural and impossible to replicate with traditional instruments, chances are the sound was made with a computer program. Again, whichever genre you are listening to, familiarize yourself with all of the different instruments. Listen to how they sound. ",

I really don\u2019t know how others do that. But it might be useful for you to search for MIDI files of piece of music of your interest, open it in your DAW, you\u2019ll see the broader picture, at least you\u2019ll know how the instruments are called and how many people it takes to play them. Otherwise, it\u2019s very easy to pick up notation, and just follow the notes on the paper coinciding to notes that you hear. It\u2019s all available on the net for free, just spend a little time on it. ",

I could not identify a pedal steel guitar as such until I married a prolific pedal steel guitar player. Now, I recognize it every time I hear it. Also, my husband has a vast knowledge of music. He is 71 and has been a professional musician since he was 15 (yes, 15!) So, he has taught me a lot. I have been getting a music education from him since 1999. My ex was a musician too, but punk rock, which is different. ",
