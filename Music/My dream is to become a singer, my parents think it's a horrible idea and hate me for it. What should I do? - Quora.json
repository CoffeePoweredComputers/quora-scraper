Nothing wrong with wanting to belt out a tune to soap suds. so go for it! Take lessons, learn from the best. Take on a few America\u2019s best contests. Have fun with it, go with it. Enjoy yourself! But all look have a career education path. Go for a career in something tangible too, because you can do both! Sing your heart out!! ",
