            "answer_text": "I would answer this from a christian point of view because in the New Testament of the christian bible there is a chapter and a verse that is succinct to the point and this is found in the book of Matthew 11: 29-30. 29Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me; for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.\u201d Berean Study Bible \u00b7 Download The christian who is also known as a believer, literally takes the word of God and meditate on it either by saying it aloud or turning it over and over in THEIR heart till THEY and the word *become one.  ( *in the sense that  you are bind to the word, inseparable) The yoke being referred to here is synonymous with a burden.  so deep sorrow is a burden of the heart, one that can becomes too heavy to carry and to unburden with the help of someone who knows exactly what to do, and HIS name is Jesus. what I would normally do is to say his word back to him and personalise it in the end as a form of prayer. for example, i would say: Lord this is your word to me, and I thank you for it as you invite me to offload how I feel    onto you.  I trust in your word  and as I do this, I find rest for my SOUL, in Jesus name, Amen. A step further to all this is that you depend upon the word to do exactly what it says it would do. I hope that this would help someone out there who is overburdened somehow and would like  rest for their  soul. ",

            "answer_text": "Sorrow, despair; nothingness, a chronological sadness and all of the emotions demeaning your life, our life; my life, is a time for you to listen to your soul. This hour, your soul is tormented with thoughts of depression; panic. Practice silence. When you're quiet, you can listen to your spirit talking to you. Understand, deep sorrow is a very important part of the human existence. At this time, you learn more about yourself. Keep a journal if you want to keep a track of your thoughts. Living freely is a choice. The door is always open; just look for it. In the darkest times; have hope. You've been through so much before; this shall too pass. :) ",
