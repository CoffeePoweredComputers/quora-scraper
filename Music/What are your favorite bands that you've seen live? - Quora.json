            "answer_text": "In 2017, JAIN received the prestigious SXSW Grulke Award for Best Non-American Actor. Austin has seen the birth of a unique and powerful global pop singer. Now in 2018, with her second album Soldier, JAIN is a full world pop star and her energy on the stage is one of our best fun live this year. The French singer sings a women's performance. Wearing a purple suit resembling an astronaut has a wireless control strap that allows her to manipulate the soundtrack while her dance moves move every inch of the stage. Songs such as the explosive \"Star\", the powerful \"Well\" and the \"Headers\" stunned the Montreal Concert Hall with the same energy as San Francisco Mezzanine. If you do not sweat after displaying JAIN, you will encounter a problem. Although fully realized in Europe (and followed by French fans wherever they play), it is clear that they can continue to establish close ties with the American public thanks to pop music around the world. Jane draws voices from Africa and the Middle East, where she grew up. It also turns into France and America with the new hip-hop elements. Hoping that the United States will appreciate the wonderful pop singer who is today at the crossroads of his promising career and live experience.
