            "answer_text": "I don't consider Nirvana one of the great Grunge era bands. They certainly were good, and they certainly were notorious. And they absolutely were the spark that ignited focus on a region, a scene and a city. Nirvana, and many other bands related to the Seattle \u2018sound\u2019 were already signed and releasing records in the mid to late 80's. But beyond a few people with an ear very close to the ground, and the movers and shakers of the northwest US, no one new what was about to happen until Nirvana blew the roof off the dump with Smells Like Teen Spirit, from the Nevermind album in the fall of 1991. The bands that have and will endure (for me, personally) are Alice in Chains and Soundgarden. Unfortunately there has been no significant new music from Soundgarden in well over a decade, and since the untimely death of singer Chris Cornell in 2017, there never will be. Alice in Chains however, after losing original singer, Layne Staley in 2002, regrouped with new band member, William Duvall, and have released (as of this year) the same number of albums as with the original lineup. Having also lost original bassist, Mike Starr (both deaths heroin related), this band has proven to be stronger than the sum of it's parts, releasing emotional, relevant rock albums that always bear their unique stamp, sound and style. Both Alice in Chains and Soundgarden have the endurance, body of work and enigmatic qualities of all great bands of the past: incredible output, profoundly good records, and prodigious talent. These are the only two bands I still listen to from the scene, the only two that will most likely endure as part of what I take forward from that brief and brilliant ignition point in the early 90's. Not saying I won't ever put on the Mad Season album, Above (insanely good hybrid of Staley and Pearl Jam's Mike McCready), or give the Screaming Trees a go. But my enthusiasm for Nirvana, and many of the more obscure bands from the scene has waned substantially. Alice in Chains and Soundgarden, both, transcended the scene and \u2018sound\u2019 of Seattle, and will forever stand on their own, independently, as giants of music. ",

Another good band that is an interesting mix of Grunge and Emo from around that era is called Texas Is The Reason. Finally, a popular answer to this question would be Pearl Jam. Many fans of Grunge like this band almost as much as Nirvana. I think their music is kind of hit and miss but I do like some of their songs. ",
