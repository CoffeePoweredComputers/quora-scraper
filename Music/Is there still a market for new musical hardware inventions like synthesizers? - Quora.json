            "answer_text": "I think hadware synths are being overtaken by pads and software synths. The software emulation is so accurate that it's simply not worth buying hardware anymore. The killer feature is a wave table where you can drop samples in and do whatever you want. On top of this, we also have a large variety synths that simply aren't available in the hardware world. With that said, I think modular synthesis still has a market. The name of this game is go cheaper. While there are modular synth emulators like Max8, they are very difficult to use, and honestly, they don't sound very good once you get the instruments set up. There are unusual hardware tools that aren't really found in the real world, and only in studios. They aren't sold to the public. If you can sell directly to the industry, then your doing okay, probably. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a (comparatively) huge market for new synthesizers both hardware and software. There\u2019s always way more new synthesizers than I have time to read up on. However there\u2019s not a lot of innovation in hardware. Mostly just picking and choosing well known features to try to make a synthesizer that checks off the boxes for a buyer. There\u2019s only a few hardware synths that do granular synthesis for example. And the last time I heard of a new synthesis type it was granular, but that\u2019s been around a long time now. If I had the money, I would buy a Waldorf Quantum, due to it\u2019s depth of synthesis capability but it\u2019s also $4500. On the other hand, Behringer will sell you a clone of a 30+ year old synth for cheap - nice on the pocketbook, but very weak on innovation. ",
