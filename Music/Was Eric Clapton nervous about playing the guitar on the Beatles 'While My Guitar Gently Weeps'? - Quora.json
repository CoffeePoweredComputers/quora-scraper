            "answer_text": "Yes, he was. George Harrison said Eric Clapton was \u201creally nervous\u201d about even coming to the studio.  Photo above: Ringo with wife Maureen Cox, George Harrison with wife Patti Boyd and guest guitarist Eric Clapton - fourth from left behind Ringo, at Heathrow Airport, June 1968. But why was he nervous? Well, because The Beatles were well-known for keeping their recording sessions off-limits to outsiders. So for Eric to even go there he felt he would be intruding. When George invited him, his reaction was: \u201cOh, no, I can\u2019t do that. Nobody\u2019s ever played on a Beatles record and the others wouldn\u2019t like it.\u201d But George insisted. He felt that, and with good reasons he felt that way, the other Beatles were ignoring the recording of his composition, \u201cWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps\u201d, which he felt was a very good song and needed support. At that time in 1968, during the recording of \u201cWhite Album\u201d, it was every Beatle for himself. That\u2019s why it was not the usual Beatles album but a collection of solo projects with the others as back-up band: John\u2019s songs, Paul\u2019s songs, George\u2019s songs. The album became a clear indication that The Beatles were breaking away from each other. It took some convincing. But George, who wanted to be able to focus on vocals and rhythm guitar, was determined to get Eric to play lead guitar. He told him: \u201cLook, it\u2019s my song and I\u2019d like you to play on it.\u201d Eventually, Eric reluctantly agreed to come and play. And it turned out he need not have worried about the others not liking his presence. For when he came the others were suddenly in their best behavior and began to take George\u2019s composition more seriously. In fact, Paul sat at once on the piano and made up a nice intro for the song. Thank you. (Sources: Cheatsheet/Anthology) ",

            "answer_text": "He had some trepidation about it because no one played on Beatles records except Beatles. George asked him to do it when they were driving around in George\u2019s car. It was good for George to have an ally in the studio, as John and Paul were very cruel and condescending to George and were not even playing on While My Guitar Gently Weeps. Eric played an amazing solo, very different from what he was known for. George loved it, and it gave him the confidence to stand up for himself. If Clapton thought George was great, then he was great, raising his stature in the band. ",
