            "answer_text": "Music videos on YouTube get more views than other videos because they have one thing other videos do not. Replayability. Have you ever wondered how the most viewed video on YouTube (\u201cGangnam Style\u201d) has over 2.8 BILLION views when it is estimated that under 3 billion people in the world own computers? It\u2019s absurd to think that almost all of the people in the world who have computers have watched Gangnam Style. I know personally many of people who haven\u2019t even watched \u201cGangnam Style\u201d on YouTube. So how can the video have that many views? Replayability! People watch the video once and they find it catchy. Then they throw it on a playlist and watch it a few more times while working out or doing homework. Then they show their friends. One person may listen to a single song more than 20 times because it is catchy, or they like the lyrics, or it inspires them. Other types of videos don\u2019t have this affect on viewers. I mean, who watches a baking tutorial video 20 times? Usually only one or two viewings will do. Same thing for a gaming video. Maybe it was funny, but once it is over there is little reason to re-watch the video. A vlog? Same thing. Why watch it more than once? These videos have little replayability while music videos have high replayability. That is why music videos tend to get insane amounts of views. ",
