            "answer_text": "Let us break this down to understand what we need to practise and accomplish. There are 2 aspects:1. Listen to and play a melody2. Listen to and play a chord Melody:1. Say, you hear a melody which will have a series of notes.2. you identify how many semitones far each note is from the previous (1 semitone = 1 fret)3. you identify where the first note is on the fretboard4. you play the melody. Now, the question is how do you do this. One approach is to listen to a melody and try to transcribe it on the guitar. Do this for some time everyday and you will start identifying the simpler melodies quicker. Complex ones will take more time. This is a natural way to learn as this is how we learn to speak and this is how our brains are wired. We learn the simple syllables as infants as we hear them from others. Then we learn words and associate them to things. We learn sentences and associate them to actions. We learn to speak coherently and associate the speeches to ideas. Similarly, listen to simple melodies in songs or even in your head and try to replicate it on the guitar. This is going to be frustrating in the beginning, but keep trying. try to play the melody on a single string first so that you understand the distance between two notes and program your brain to memorize this \"distance\" by repeating this again and again with different melodies. This will also help you identify which scale (scale is different from key)the melody is in, as you would know how a scale sounds. Chord:Memorizing and identifying a chord \"type\" (major, minor, maj7th, sus2, etc) is easier as each chord type has a distinct sound and feel to it. To me, each chord evokes certain emotion so its easier to identify these. This changes with the premise the chord is played in.  For example, if there is a green text on a white paper, you will be able to read it in natural light. But the paper will appear blank if you hold it in a green light. Similarly, if you play an E minor chord, it has a certain tension in its sound (It gives me a hint of sadness). But if you play it after a diminished 5th D, it suddenly sounds complete. While learning a song, if you identify and memorize these patterns and relationships between chords, you will start identifying the chord \"type\" easily. The difficult part is identifying the key, or what chord exactly is it playing. You may identify that it is a minor chord, but is it Aminor or Bminor? To identify this without an instrument in hand is difficult unless you teach yourself to do so ( I can do this with my guitar in hand. Without it, I can only identify a few common keys). To be able to do this, one has to memorize certain pitches and then compare the sound to these memorized pitches to find out what key is it. I know what is the pitch of C Major chord or Bminor chord and I can identify these whenever I hear it. I know the pitch of the upper e string of my guitar. So I can tune it without a tuner. If you memorize these pitches, you can identify the key and the chord type easily. A good way to build the pitches in your memory is by humming the note you play on the guitar. So when you hear a note and hum it, your brain automatically makes an approximation of where this note might lie on the fret board. Hope this helps! Thanks for A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, learning to play a song by ear is different to learning to play a riff by ear, as a song entails the chords, groove, melody, and other aspects (and possibly including the riff). The first thing to try and do is to establish the key. If you don\u2019t know what keys are in music, grab a music theory book and read up on that. The key will tell you what are the most likely notes to use, and therefore which ones to avoid or only aim for if the notes in the key (diatonic notes) are not working. In the beginning, it will seem pretty daunting as you will have to work out the riff note for note. But here are some basic pointers: 1) don\u2019t aimlessly slide up and down each guitar string until you happen to find the first note of the riff. Instead, imagine how high or low it could be and perhaps even on which string it might be located. Then play one note. If it matches the riff\u2019s starting note, you\u2019ve lucked out and should head to Vegas. 2) If, as is more likely the case, you haven\u2019t got the right note, don\u2019t play another note right away. Instead, try to make a decision as to whether your note is higher or lower than the actual note. Once you have determined that, make a decision by how much. At this stage, you would do better if you had learned about intervals. Intervals are sizes of steps or leaps, or the distances between two notes. For example, C to C# or D would be a fairly small interval, while C to A, Bb, or B would be a large interval, almost an octave. In the middle you would have fourths and fifths (C to F or C to G, for example). The sound of each interval can be memorized by learning a song that begins with that interval. For example, the minor third starts Greensleeves, the major third starts Vivaldi\u2019s Spring (1st mvmt), the perfect 4th starts Amazing Grace, and so on. Being able to hear these distances or intervals can obviously help you reduce the \u2018ear noise\u2019 you produce when you randomly play too many notes in desperation. So try to be informed through theory and ear training rather than random action. 3) So let\u2019s say you have found the first note. You now try to estimate by how far and in which direction the next note is from the one you have just found. And so on, until you have worked out the riff. If the riff consists of clear sounds from a scale such as the major scale or blues scale, and you can play scales, then again this will help you find the notes, eventually more than just one at a time. Do you need help in determining how to hear a chord progression as well? That\u2019s a different answer altogether. ",
