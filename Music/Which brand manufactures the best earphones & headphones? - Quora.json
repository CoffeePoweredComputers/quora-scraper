            "answer_text": "Some manufacturers design their products with lots of passion, and research. Try to seek them, as they are present in different names for different levels of sound. V-moda are experts in V shaped sound signature (high bass and high high pitched sound) \u2026 There are many other which are not popular yet. Those manufacturers design every product as if there is some inheritable connectivity to them, so each product in their lineup promises with the same quality. Perfection to them is a personality trait. I can't name really , because it might put some notable ones on the top while some really good which are just cottage produced as little noticed. Furthermore, try to do some research on those who uses tags that they are perfect but aren't. Of which I can proudly boast an example is Apple. It's not that I dont love apple, some of its prouducts are great but when it comes to airpods , they suck. A lot of truly wireless pairs did exist which were and still are much much much better than those. Still if you seek the heart of the headphones and not the periphery show of it, (as a compassionate human being) Then, do some research on those manufacturers which tend to perfect each and every product they launch, You won't be disappointed when you put them around your ears and appreciate true craftsmanship. However, some really good examples are (as you have red this long answer with sincerity) Bang and Olufsen, Bowers and wilkins, Audze, Beyerdynamics. However there are a lot , yet unknown companies too. ",

            "answer_text": "All headphone companies tend to have a huge target market, and all are manufacturers are trying to bring the best possible solution for their consumers. but it is difficult to mark a single best company that is why there is a handful of great headphone brands that deserves a mention here. voz electronics Voz electronics is a Taiwan based company that started in 2005. they are well-establish OEM earphones, speakers, and micro internal magnet loudspeaker manufacturers and suppliers serving the industry for a couple of years. They are recognized for producing all kinds of China micro internal speaker, mylar speaker, and OEM earphones with precision. Sony Sony is a big name in electronics and literally offers the best headphones. they are gone over just over-ear headphones. Sony headphones are best suited for casual listening, and their all headphone products are not good but still, I personally like it. and, they do have many premium in-ear and over-ear headphones and earplugs editions that are well worth trying. Bose Bose has been around in the industry for some years, and they've gained recognition for producing high-grade audio performance. Bose isn't an economical option, and their products are pretty expensive in accordance with the quality of their products. They've faced a lot of criticism for putting out products currently that are extremely expensive for the majority of listeners. Sennheiser Sennheiser is another big name of audio equipment, and are highlighted for manufacturing studio-grade equipment and over-ear headphones. Sennheiser also offers some average products but mostly the headphones that Sennheiser produces are unbeatable. ",
