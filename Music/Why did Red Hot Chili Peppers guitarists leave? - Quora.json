            "answer_text": "Hillel Slovak left the band to concentrate on another band he was playing with, What Is This? Jack Sherman was asked to step aside when founder member and close friend of Anthony Kiedis Hillel Slovak wanted to return. Hillel Slovak subsequently died of a heroin overdose. DeWayne \u201cBlackbird\u201d McKnight was fired a hot minute after he joined the band, lacking \u201cchemistry\u201d with the others (and subsequently threatening to burn down Kiedis\u2019 house) John Frusciante quit halfway through a tour, struggling with both an increased level of success and fame and a heroin addiction. Arik Marshall and Jesse Tobias were in the band briefly following Frusciante's departure, but were dismissed, Tobias for incompatibility, Marshall, if you can believe it, for being too busy to attend rehearsals. Dave Navarro was fired, again for incompatibility with the rest of the band. John Frusciante, aided in his recovery from heroin addiction and various resultant health problems by the band, eventually left to concentrate on his solo career, saying that his musical interests had diverged from those of the rest of the band. Josh Klinghoffer was asked to step aside when the band invited John Frusciante to rejoin. John Frusciante is back in the band for the third time. (Edited in July 2020 to update) ",
