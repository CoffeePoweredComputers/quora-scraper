            "answer_text": "There are effectively three types of group. Organic bands- these form when when like-minded amateurs join forces in an attempt to become a professional group. Most groups (U2, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles) begin this way. People united by their mutual love of a genre of music start playing together and then getting gigs where they can and paying their dues before they get a recording contract. Traditionally these groups write their own songs and play their own instruments.  Supergroups- while the term is sometimes applied to a group that has become hugely successful, the real definition is a group who are comprised of people who are already famous and successful. Cream are often called the first Supergroup because Gigner Baker, Jack Bruce and Eric Clapton had already been successful recording artists before they joined forces. Supergroups normally play their own instruments and write their own music. Manufactured groups- These are bands who come together because auditions are held to create a band to appeal to a certain market. The group have never met prior to forming and their musical direction is usually determined by the managers who bring them together. Frequently people are chosen for their appearance as much as for their musical talent. The most famous early example are The Monkees who were chosen for a TV show and later examples include famous groups like New Kids on the Block and The Spice Girls.  One Direction fit into the last category. They're a manufactured Boy Band who were put together especially to appeal to a teenage girl market who like the sound of attractive young boys singing pop songs. They don't play their own instruments or write their own music and their career is determined by the men behind the scenes who run their career (and make most of the money). (There's nothing wrong with this by the way. Please don't go thinking I'm looking down on manufactured groups. One Direction were created to appeal to a certain demographic and they're doing it very successfully. There's nothing at all wrong with that as far as I'm concerned. If you don't like them, don't listen.)  ",

They love their fans, they know how important they are.  Talented. yes, they're more than just 4 good looking lads. They have incredible voices.  And I disagree with anybody that says they only sing pop-catchy songs. Try listening to their albums sometime.  ",
