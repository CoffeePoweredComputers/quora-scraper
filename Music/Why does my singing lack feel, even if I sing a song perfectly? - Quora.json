            "answer_text": "There is a huge difference between learning a 'song' and learning to 'sing'.  It is the difference between a perfect mimicry artist and the original actor. I have seen many singers putting a lot of sincere, painstaking effort on reproducing a song perfectly. I call them \u2018Songers\u2019. Listening intently, identifying every nuance. Practising and reproducing it perfectly. And yet there is no feel. Then there are others who are technically far from being perfect, and yet they have a lot of feel. I call them \u2018Singers\u2019 The songers believe that if they imitate sincerely enough, they will gradually begin to develop their own style and feel. But though they grow popular and attract audiences, the audiences come for the original singers they imitate, not for the songer himself. Why does this happen?The songer is like a person trying to reproduce a master piece.  He divides the painting into the smallest pixels and then reproduces each and every pixel with sincerity. He starts from here:  Smaller the pixels and better the reproduction \u2013 closer it is to the original song. Goes on doing this for days, laboriously, sincerely, one by one. This whole process of divide, identify and reproduce is a mechanical process. He is not aware of the \u2018painting\u2019 - only the pixels. Hours of effort and a million pixels later \u2013 he gets this:  Is the effort amazing? Yes? Especially if it's perfect down to the last pixel. Is it meaningful? No. The same effort and skill could produce any other master piece \u2013 each equally meaningless as the previous one. What are we painting here? No clue! Seems same as the earlier piece  But what is being 'imitated' is this:  But for the 'songer' - it's all the same. Each painting is equally meaningless as the other. A slight \u2018Lack of skills\u2019 in this approach would mean missing or wrongly reproducing random pixels. There is no connection between the imperfections. And that is the problem. A songer who is not that good at identifying the fine tonal variances. His pixels are much larger. The outcome is meaningless. (This is the Mona Lisa at extremely low resolution) But he thinks he is doing it perfectly.   But the important thing is even great skills would result in something that is same as the painting, but never better, different or meaningful. The songer is like a scanning machine. It reproduces perfectly, but it does not understand what it is scanning. No matter how good it is. An expression that is totally 'wrong' compared to the original but still has meaning is always much better. Someone who seeks 'inspiration' from the painting and creates something like this has much more soul than the mechanical \u2018perfection\u2019 of the songer  A real artist starts from an idea, then gives it form. The form might be in visual colors or musical tones, on canvas or on a guitar. The form might be long and intricate - but the underlying idea is what gives it the soul that unites all those strokes and tones. The form by itself is lifeless.  Like a sculptor, who starts with a metal frame of his basic idea and then gives it flesh and bones. The flesh and bones might take the most skills to create, but it\u2019s the underlying frame that determines their beauty. So it's very possible that the best imitation lacks soul, and an imperfect original has plenty of it. It is unique, it has it's own idea, it's own meaning, it's own authenticity. And hence it is beautiful.  So how does one go from being a songer to a singer? That's a different question which will be addressed later! You can follow my singing on my Facebook page  ",

            "answer_text": "Singing with feel is way more than just replicating even the most minute of modulations within a song. Voice is a very personal instrument, and you need to really immerse yourself into the lyrics - you really cannot get this by learning all the technique in the world. John Lennon, as good of a singer as he is, never has perfect technique or replicates the recording exactly as it is within his live performances (in fact he thinks his voice does not sound good that he asks George Martin to do something about it during his Beatles days, which the latter complies by double-tracking), but his singing manages to touch the hearts of millions of people. Similarly, Kurt Cobain was not a good singer in technical terms, but he was able to influence a whole generation of grunge rockers in a way that your average American Idol or The Voice singer can never do. I am not saying you should ignore technique; in fact great technique will improve your singing even much more, and will help your interpretation in a much better way. However, do not be that singer who tries too hard to replicate everything in a song perfectly - that is not a creative way to grow into a more appealing vocalist. Instead, take the idea of a song, identify the possible emotions you can come out with, and see how you will interpret it according to your will. It does not have to always work, but that is fine because this exploration stage is what will later develop you into a more appealing singer. The feel as based on how you approach it will come on its own without you even realising it.   ",
