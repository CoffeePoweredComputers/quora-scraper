            "answer_text": "Well based on your description, you kind of are being picky (no hate) So I did some research and found a smaller company like you are asking for. It seems like a pretty good company to me\u2026.. Woollim Entertainment Something interesting I found about this entertainment is they used to be merged with SM Entertainment, but now they are an independent entertainment, so they separated. Back in 2016, a group called INFINITE, their comeback was a big hit (haha no pun intended) it\u2019s been a success all up to this point. There is another group called Golden Child and when they debuted in August 2017, their song called \u2018DamDadi\u2019 there was lots of talking about them from their high energy and youthfulness. Heres the website if you want to take a look Top 10 K-Pop Entertainment Companies in 2017 - Startup Radar SM Entertainment Yes, hear me out. I know you said you don\u2019t really wanna go to SM because it\u2019s a little racist. BUT, there are some artists that are foreigners and are still under SM. They are still successful too! Yes, there may be some racism here and there but if you want to be an idol, you HAVE to go through struggles once and a while\u2026. There are some other companies out there, but some of them are pretty small ( like really small ). You can keep looking for other entertainments but if I were you I would try SM, Starship, FNC, or Woollim. ",

            "answer_text": "This is not an answer. This is just a description for the question. I\u2019m not trying to be picky or anything, but I would rather not have the Big 3, Cube or Pledis. BigHit doesn\u2019t accept female trainees, so that\u2019s out of the question. I actually want to go to a smaller company, not saying that I want a better chance of getting debuted but\u2026 YG is now more looks than talent. And I don\u2019t want to be in some shitty dungeon. SM has plastic surgery and is strict. I also heard they\u2019re a little bit racist (to foreign trainees, I\u2019m a Malaysian Chinese, and their treatment to Chinese idols are\u2026). Anyways, I\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m not choosing SM because of plastic surgery, but I would rather not be forced to go, like \u201cif you don\u2019t get plastic surgery, you won\u2019t get to debut,\u201d but personally I think I don\u2019t need plastic surgery, I have the V-shaped jaw, my eyes aren\u2019t doll-like big but they suit my face, my nose isn\u2019t big, and my lips are quite pretty. I don\u2019t mind minor enhancements, but I sure as Hell don\u2019t need Yuta\u2019s surgery. JYP\u2019s great and all, but he lets go of so many trainees, like Jeon Somi. And besides, JYP will have a new girl group, if I audition now, I\u2019ll have to wait even longer. Cube has Pentagon, CLC and HyunA\u2019s problem. I don\u2019t want to be part of that mess. I heard Pledis silences idols that leave Pledis, and I heard it\u2019s really bad, so\u2026 no. I was gonna try Starship and FNC, but are there any alternatives? Just in case I don\u2019t manage to get in both. ",

            "answer_text": "You should go for agencies that match your style. It sounds like you like Blackpink, so YG would be a good first option. But as always, tens of thousands apply for every trainee slot available in the big 3. So you may want to apply to several agencies if you\u2019re really serious about getting in somewhere. You haven\u2019t really given us much to go on for recommendations as \u201cgood singer, average dancer\u201d fits just about every agency\u2019s profile. Be aware that k-pop is heavily dependent on looks, even at supposedly talent-focused agencies like YG. Also the beauty standard in Korea is pale skin, not tanned, so you might want to go heavy on the sunscreen while you\u2019re auditioning. ",

            "answer_text": "Based on the fact that you prefer Blackpink\u2019s style - my immediate answer would be that audition for YG. YG is the only one (that I can think of right now) that hasn\u2019t made his girl group do a cute concept. He does fun concpets, but not cute. All the other companies like to start of cute and the gradually mature over time as they gain popularity. ",
