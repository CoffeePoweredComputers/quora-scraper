            "answer_text": "I live in Japan, so I\u2019m surrounded by pop music that I can\u2019t stand. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014I love living in Japan. I even love a few Japanese pop singers. (Namie Amuro, why did you retire?! You\u2019re awesome!) But anything by a massive girl-idol group whose performers (I won\u2019t call them singers) were chosen solely for their youth and cuteness and not their talent is just going to grate on my nerves. Specific example: \u201cHeavy Rotation\u201d by AKB48  Note: The video is safe for work, but anybody looking over your shoulder will think you\u2019re a pervert. It\u2019s midway between looking at a lingerie catalog and straight-up porn. Also note that some of the girls in the video are underage. (And yes, I only watched the first 20 seconds of it just to make sure I was getting the right song.) But we\u2019re talking about the song, not the video. If you\u2019ve managed to listen to it, you\u2019ll see how insipid the lyrics are. The singing is flat and childish\u2014pretty standard with girl-group singers, as a \u201cnaive\u201d sound is prized. (Yes, I know, it\u2019s really creepy.) Now imagine this sound being blared out of half the shop PA systems all over your city, for two months straight. Now please don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking I hate Japan, or Japanese music, or even Japanese pop music. I love living in Japan, and I love many, many things about Japan. I love lots of Japanese music. As for pop music, well hey, I hate most pop music of any nation, but there\u2019s plenty of Japanese pop music that I enjoy. So as not to be negative, here are some good songs: \u201cDo Me More\u201d by Amie Namuro  (Youtube only has a 1-minute clip of the official video, sorry.) And \u201cSugar Water\u201d by Cibo Matto  (OK, Cibo Matto isn\u2019t exactly all the popular. Most of my students haven\u2019t heard of them. But they\u2019re awesome.) ",

            "answer_text": "What popular song do you secretly hate? Hate? That word seems so overused these days, in my opinion. Well, haha. Do you mean on what popular song don\u2019t you like? It overall depends on your own humble opinion on what do you think on what are popular songs that you dislike, which means don\u2019t like. But in my opinion? Umm, I personally wouldn\u2019t say I hate these songs since they are just not my taste and I hope my own answer with my own opinion only doesn\u2019t get banned and reported by Quora Moderation, but to be honest. The first song that I don\u2019t like is. To be very honest, I really don\u2019t Blackpink\u2019s \u201cKill This Love\u201d at all. I\u2019m so sorry to all Blinks, but I just don\u2019t like the song nor Blackpink at all. Blackpink just doesn\u2019t appeal my taste for K-pop even though I love K-pop. In my humble opinion, I do love K-pop, but the reason why I don\u2019t like the song \u201c\u201cKill This Love\u201d it\u2019s because of the beat. Do I need to say anything more? But to be very honest, I really don\u2019t like the beat of the song. I don\u2019t know why, but I feel like that I personally find the K-pop song to be really annoying and cheesy overall. And plus, The lyrics don\u2019t make any sense either since that K-pop song is still bland, boring, basic and overall and that\u2019s why I\u2019m not a fan of the song nor the group. But if you guys like the song, that\u2019s cool with me. I can respect your taste as long if you respect mine back since I still don\u2019t like the song. You know, Not everyone can like the same thing as you guys do since you can\u2019t tell me to like Blackpink. Sure I still can see the appeal of Blackpink though, but I just don\u2019t like them nor their music. Again, like I said, I\u2019m so sorry to all Blinks, but I just don\u2019t like it. Another popular song that I don\u2019t like is pretty much all of Momoland\u2019s music. In my opinion, I don\u2019t know why, but Momoland just doesn\u2019t fit for my taste of K-pop, in my opinion. Another reason on why I don\u2019t like Momoland is because of their vocals. Do I really need to say something? I find their vocals to be very average overall to me, in my opinion. Even Blackpink has better vocals. I\u2019m still not a Blink though, to be honest. And that was why on why I don\u2019t like Momoland nor their songs. Sorry! Sure I can see the appeal of their music, but I just don\u2019t like them. Its just my opinion though. Period! Not trying to hurt someone who likes Momoland though, which is why I don\u2019t want my answer to get reported by Quora Moderation. Again, Anyways, Here are some 3 more popular songs that I just don\u2019t like, in my opinion: Walk It Like I Talk It by Migos: One word: Annoying and overplayed. I Like It by Cardi B: In my opinion, This song is really annoying overall. I don\u2019t know why is it played a lot though. Plus, Cardi herself is overall really annoying. To be honest, I don\u2019t like how she acts durning interviews. She\u2019s super annoying. Solo by Jennie Kim: One word: Overrated. So yeah, Those were some popular songs that I don\u2019t like overall, in my opinion. Have a nice day! Yours and truly, ~Evelyn M. <3 ",
