            "answer_text": "By and large, yes: guitars should be interchangeable between games.  (Assuming you're not trying to do something outrageous, like use a PS3 guitar on a PS2, or an XBOX 360 for that matter.) There are some caveats, though.  While equipment for Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock and Rock Band 3 seemed to be broadly compatible, a number of the older games were less so, where a Rock Band guitar would not work in Guitar Hero 5, for instance, showing up as a microphone controller instead.  The console you're using also makes a difference; while some title and console combinations would have game updates available to support broader ranges of equipment, others would not.  There are also some guitar features - the \"tapping strip\" on some Guitar Hero guitars, and their lack of \"solo buttons\" - which will not impact core gameplay, but will limit access to some of the games' various little stylistic features. All of this says nothing about Rock Band 4 and Guitar Hero Live, both coming out in October 2015.  Wireless XBOX 360 Rock Band and Guitar Hero instruments should be able to work on the XBOX ONE via the use of a dongle that plugs into the USB port; PlayStation 3 instruments should just straight-up work.  Due to gameplay changes, it's hard to imagine that the new XBOX ONE or PS4 Guitar Hero controller is going to work with Rock Band 4, nor vice versa; equipment will very probably be incompatible between the two games. There are substantive (if not exhaustive) lists of controller compatibility listed here, should that help any:CompatibilityThe Rock Band 4 Instrument Compatibility Chart ",
