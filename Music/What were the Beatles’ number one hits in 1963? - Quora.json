            "answer_text": "The only number one the Beatles had in 1963 was She Loves You. It was released midway through 1963 in England and became a number one hit. It got a lot of airplay in the U.S. in 1963, but I don\u2019t think it actually hit #1 until 1964. After that, all hell broke loose and the Beatles had more numbered hits in the U.S. In fact, it was reported that they held the numbers 1,2,3,4,5 8,11.17 and 25 spots during one week in 1964\u201365. Now don\u2019t quote me on the exact numbers, but it read very similar to what I have put. They did however hold the top five that I just citied, and one hit would go from #1 to #2, and another Beatle hit would replace it in the number 1 spot. Unprecedented in history, and pretty darn exciting. I remember some of it although I was a child. Electricity was in the air. ",

Though not every chart recorded \u201cPlease Please Me\u201d as a number one, many did. In the US, they didn\u2019t have any number ones until 1964: their initial release on Vee-Jay records sank like a stone; after a massive marketing campaign by Capitol Records in early 1964 they hit the jackpot there.
