            "answer_text": "Cool down, stretch your legs, change shirts if it's a hot summer night. Those lights are murder, all those news reports where so and so collapsed due to dehydration, it's the lights that did that and whatever weakened them in the first place. Check in with the crew about sound and lights and the crowd. Anything that effects the gig. Weather conditions for your safety and the audience. Basically it's work related stuff, some drinks can be passed around but no serious drinking because there's a bunch of work to do tearing down and getting home. Some people think it's a party but it's a job. ",

As a drummer, I like to stretch my legs and back a bit on breaks, and I usually like to try and save my voice - so I don\u2019t like to have long-winded conversations. If it\u2019s a concert or show. I\u2019ll just hang out in the green room. ",
