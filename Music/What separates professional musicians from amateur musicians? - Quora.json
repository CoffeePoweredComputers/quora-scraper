            "answer_text": "Your attention is drawn to them only when they choose, and it is tasteful and stylistically appropriate.They have an excellent sense of rhythm -- \u2018good time\u2019The other answers seem to focus on the facts of financial sustainability. From your wording, it seems you are looking for an answer regarding performance. E.g. you walk into a bar and a trio is playing. Are they pros or amateurs? Professional players consider the performance from multiple perspectives. What is my role at this time in this piece? How is what I'm playing perceived by the audience? How will this affect what the other musicians are doing? Is this idea appropriate to this style and this situation? They will consider what they are doing as part of a greater whole. Professionals will rarely play flashy attention grabbing ideas or very quick lines, unless appropriate. They will make playing look easy, unless appropriate. They will almost appear invisible or inaudible, except when appropriate. They will be deliberate and in control. As an audience member, you will find your attention drifting slowly around the stage as ideas and sections are developed and concluded. There appears to be one thing happening at a time. It may be two people involved, or three contrasting lines, but it is one composition. Watching an amateur band, you may be distracted chaotically by different people playing disparate ideas. Perhaps two rhythmic ideas are happening that don't fit together cleanly. Perhaps two people are playing a lead line. Perhaps one player is significantly louder than the rest. All these things indicate that the people involved are not fully aware of some aspect or another of the art form. The more obvious one is bad time. Good rhythm and being a good musician are hand in hand. The best players spend a huge amount of their practice routine on time, and ensure they have meticulous control over rhythm. Playing a sour note or two is no problem at all, and can even add character to great music. Bad time, on the other hand, is incredibly jarring to the listener, and absolutely ruins your chances of playing professionally, except in the most cynical and empty corners of the music industry. ",

            "answer_text": "A lot of people would say the quality of the music. But I would disagree, I know (and sometimes perform with) some superb musicians who perform only as a hobby and have a totally separate job. I would still call these people amateur. To be professional, I personally see it as you make most of your living by performing/composing. The grey area is though, that so many musicians/artists/actors etc will often have another job that is different to their craft. I for example have a photography business. As a singer, if I get sick or lose my voice, I can lose a whole week of work, which is of course not ideal. There is no official definition though and everyone will interpret it differently. If you are not sure about whether \u2018you are allowed\u2019 to call yourself professional. Think of it this way, if someone were to ask you \u2018what is your profession\u2019. Would you say musician? If you\u2019re making money out of your music and people as \u2018are you professional\u2019, don\u2019t be afraid to say yes. If you wouldn't be happy to do it for free, then stick with professional. Its a slightly simplified argument, but hope that helps! ",
