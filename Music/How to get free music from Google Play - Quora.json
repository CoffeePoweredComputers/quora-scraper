            "answer_text": "You can upload the music (or in most cases just the fact that you own the music) that you already own, and then play it back from Google Play for free. You can play any of the zillions of \u201cstations\u201d that are in Google Play, for free. You may get the occasional ad in both cases I guess? And you can also sign up for the paid Google Play using one of the deals that get you some amount of time for free (right now I think there\u2019s a July 4th special for like four months free or something?). Hope that\u2019s the sort of thing you meant\u2026 ",
