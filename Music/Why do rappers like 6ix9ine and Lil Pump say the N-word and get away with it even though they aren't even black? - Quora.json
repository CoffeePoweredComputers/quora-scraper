            "answer_text": "This is news to me. Randy Johnson\u2019s answer seems to fit the best. We have come a long way since Eminem, who may be the only major rapper (post-NWA) to never use the N-Word. I have long theorized that he does use it in speech only amongst his homeboys in D-12, who are all Black. As shocking as he liked to be on record, even early-2000s Eminem knew better than to get on that third rail. But we\u2019ve got a new generation out there now, and though I\u2019m not nearly as immersed in hip-hop today as I was 10, 15 years ago, there are two dynamics that appears to be at work here: One: as I said, I\u2019ve kind of aged out of the current genre of \u201cSoundcloud\u201d or \u201cmumble-rap\u201d And I would gather that most of us who came of age in the Public Enemy/Ice Cube/Ice T/EPMD era or the Eminem/Outkast/DMX/Jay -Z era similarly, just don\u2019t pay a lot of attention to hip hop these days. So whereas it would have been front page news if Eminem said N-word in 2000, we\u2019re not going to know who 69 or Lil Pump are in general, let alone if they said N-word. They are not on the national radar like Em or JayZ were so their controversies don\u2019t really register with us. Two: We\u2019ve traversed a couple of generations since Richard Pryor proclaimed he was never going to say \u201cNigger\u201d again. (The irony is that Pryor did more to popularize \u201cN-Word\u201d than anyone.) Since then, \u201cNigger\u201d transmogrified into \u201cNigga\u201d. \u201cNigger\u201d with the *ER* was an explicit racist statement usually uttered by Whites. \u201cNigga\u201d or \u201cNiggaz\u201d has transformed into two meanings today: a) a still derogatory statement, utilized by Blacks to describe someone who is a thug or criminal; someone from the streets. At its most benign, it has applied to the stereotype of the lazy, ignorant black man on the couch all day. ( In a more genteel era the words \u201chooligan\u201d, \u201cscofflaw\u201d and \u201cne\u2019er do well\u201d were used.) Of course, like Pryor, the word is is often used by some to describe themselves. Listen to \u201cReal Nigga Roll Call\u201d (by Lil Jon and Ice Cube) In the first part of the song, Lil Jon uses \u201cNigga\u201d to describe both himself AND his enemies. The difference is HIS \u201cNiggas\u201d are pros, and the others are scrubs. The meaning is clear. In the second part, Ice Cube punctuates every line with \u201cNigga\u201d he\u2019s alternately describing himself, his enemies, his friends, snitches, or just using it as an exclamation. Again, the meaning is never in doubt. Of course, amongst a certain caste/generation of Blacks, it\u2019s still derogatory, still used to describe those unruly elements from the streets. Chris Rock\u2019s brilliant (but unsettling) riff on \u201cNiggaz vs Black People\u201d remains a case study to this day. Upper- and Middle-class blacks, West Indians, Native Africans \u2014 these people are not \u201cNiggaz\u201d in that pejorative. (Side: The fact that that routine has become appropriated by white nationalists in the years since is a meta side dish to the whole conversation. So too is the art of co-opting slurs in general; \u201cQueer\u201d used to be the worst thing you could call a gay man. Now it\u2019s been irretrievably stolen to the point where it\u2019s in the title of TV shows.) b) A general statement: this is where it gets tricky and why the word can have a different usage with Gen X and Millennials. Anyone can be a \u201cNigga\u201d regardless of race. An action movie star, an athlete (\u201cdamn look at my nigga go!!\u201d) It has devolved, in that sense, to the same level of \u201cguy\u201d \u201cdude\u201d \u201camigo\u201d \u201casshole\u201d \u201cgeneric person in a crowd\u201d and so on. Like \u201cfuck\u201d it has become a versatile word with a myriad of usages. The flip on that is that versatility inevitably becomes co-opted by people who may or may not be familiar with the full history of the word. Which is where it becomes problematic. Most times, the aim of the word is rarely in doubt. I personally remember being called a \u201cNigger\u201d exactly once in my life. It was tossed at me by a white kid in the Catholic school I went to in the 80s. His meaning was explicit, direct, dehumanizing and with zero camaraderie in mind. I have never forgotten it. Now I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve been called \u201cNigga\u201d by others in my personal life: friends, cousins, even my mother or father have shouted it at me when upset with something I did. But I don\u2019t have any specific recollections of those instances because they meant nothing to me. In my culture, I have heard the word regularly. In casual conversation in my neighborhood, at cookouts, even in church. But that one, single use of \u201cNigger\u201d with an \u201cER\u201d hurled at me in oral violence \u2014 THAT moment is frozen in time for me and probably will be forever. So there is a definite difference. Other people have used the N-word who are not White, yet are not African-American: DJ Khaled (Palestinian), Rihanna (Bahamadian), Cardi B (Dominican) and so on. It tends to float right past the intended listener though, because, whether used as a pejorative or in the general, it\u2019s not used in a particularly violent manner. Those three examples and, (I\u2019m guessing) 69 and Lil Pump are part of that culture. They grew up hearing that word in their environments. No doubt though, things get dicey when we get into the word being used by whites \u2014 outside the realm of artistic endeavor. The most common example being whites singing along \u2014 word, for word \u2014 with a song that contains \u201cNigga\u201d. We\u2019ve seen this in youtube videos of suburban girls doing it. And recently there was that incident at the Kendrick Lamar show with Lamar seemingly perplexed that a white person would use the word. So there\u2019s still questions about \u201cNigger\u201d and \u201cNigga\u201d that cry out for context and civility. But I think 69 and Lil Pump are safe. Whoever they are. ",
