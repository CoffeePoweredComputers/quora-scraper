            "answer_text": "\u201cStay tuned\u201d is an expression limited to American television/radio advertisements, or the programming that appears between the advertisements. That programming will try to present something interesting or appealing, to keep watcher\u2019s attention. \u201cStay tuned\u201d is a request, begging, the watcher to keep watching what they have to show. You may not use it unless you join a TV show as a broadcast journalist or become a youtube video blogger who releases content that people can tune into. But advertising cares little for real relevance to the viewer, and more about captivating the audience with irrelevant gossip as if 30 minutes of about 10 news stories makes up all the news for one evening. Besides that, and this is an aside because the verbiage surrounding the tuning of instruments is more specific. If you\u2019re referring to the strings on a violin or on a guitar, one would say \u201c[the or] these strings stay tuned\u201d or \u201cthe strings stay in tune,\u201d both are acceptable and describe how well the instrument can remain in tune or well-tuned.

            "answer_text": "\u2018Stay tuned\u2019 because the second verb needs to be a past participle (I believe). This is an imperative sentence that informs the listener to remain in their current state. Like all regular verbs, the past participle and the simple past of tune are the same. Imagine during a fun game of hide \u2019n seek someone telling you to \u201cstay hidden\u201d versus \u201cstay hide\u201d. ",
