            "answer_text": "A metallic vocal sound is often simply described as \"nasally.\" Nasally voices often sound metallic, but not all metallic sounds are actually nasally.  The position of the throat when you use a short /a/ vowel (as in cat), particularly when combined with spread lips (like when you smile), produce an extremely metallic sound.  Think of a witch cackling or a Harmon mute on a brass instrument. Or the color yellow, if that means anything to you.  A metallic-sounding voice can also be accurately described as \"bright,\" \"sharp,\" (as in sharp versus dull, not to be confused with sharp versus flat) or \"brassy,\" although those are just as much technical terms as \"metallic,\" so it's probably not a particularly useful description.  I have also found that any string instrument sounds very metallic at the high notes, but exactly the opposite at lower notes.  When a woman is speaking in a metallic voice, she is typically categorized as \"girlish/immature\" (valley girl), while when a man is speaking in a metallic voice, he is typically categorized as \"manly\" (game show host).  Many people perceive a metallic sound as unpleasant, but it is often only recognized at a high pitch. A low metallic sound is very rich.  Usually, a metallic sound is considered very very undesirable; even immature, in a choir. However, it can be very pleasant in a solo song, as it adds a particular character to the voice.  Another thing: metallic voices tend to stand out in a group (here's an example in a group of male voices - I can't point out the voice but you will probably be able to tell).  Here are a couple of examples of metallic voices:  Probably annoying high metallic female singing voice Probably annoying very high metallic female singing voice (with a bonus trumpet using a Harmon mute in the background) Very good utilization of a high metallic female singing voice, transitioning into a lower less-metallic singing voice (wait for about ten seconds) Another good utilization of high female metallic singing with speaking Very low male singing voice High male speaking voice and low male speaking voice leading into low male singing voice (wait for about fifteen seconds) Highish male singing voice Highish male speaking voice In case you were wondering, whatever the opposite of \"metallic\" is, this is what it sounds like.  By the way, I did notice that all of the songs are from musical theatre; sorry for that; I guess that's mainly what I listen to and where you can find the most metallic voices.  ",
