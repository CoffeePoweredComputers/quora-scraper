            "answer_text": "These two chords are each just 3 notes played at once, which is also known as a triad. Regardless of instrument, those notes will be the same (with technical exceptions for transposing instruments). So the 3 notes you play are the same on ukelele and on piano - the way you play them is different. On uke, you can follow the chord diagrams and put your fingers places and the notes will all work out to be the 3 notes in that chord, usually with one doubled note (sometimes one an octave above or below the other). With piano you just need the 3 notes. For F, those would be F A and C, and for Am, they're A C and E. You can play them with one hand all in a row and it'll be easy and sound kinda similar to simple ukelele chords. I have the hunch that you're curious about playing piano and you've been playing some ukelele. Check out some YouTube videos for beginner piano, and follow some tutorials for playing songs you know. You'll see many parallels between the two instruments, and eventually, you'll learn a song on one and be able to figure out on the other quickly. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "An F chord on a uke is an F on a piano. An Am on a uke is an Am on the piano. That makes a uke what\u2019s called a \u201cC instrument\u201d which means when you play a C on it you get a concert C, i.e. a C on a piano. That\u2019s in contrast to say a Bb trumpet; when a trumpet player plays what looks like a C on his score, it sounds as a concert Bb. (Of course many trumpet players can read scores or lead sheets written in concert pitch, but they\u2019re internally transposing.) The typical uke is tuned GCEA with the G pitched between the E and A. The open string notes map to white keys on the piano selected from the octave starting at middle C. In string order those are called G4, C4, E4, A4. The usual open F on the uke is fingered 2010, i.e. A4, C4, F4, A4 (again). On the piano that\u2019s middle C aka C4, up a fourth to F4 and up to A4, making an F chord that\u2019s called the second inversion of F. (We call FAC root position for F major, ACF the first inversion and CFA the second inversion.) Similarly Am is 2000 on the uke, A4, C4, E4, A4 (again). On the piano that\u2019s C4 E4 A4, a first inversion Am chord. In general a pianist and a ukulele player can play from the same chart as written and they will be playing the same chords and everything will be fine. Well, at least the chord names won\u2019t be the problem. ",
