            "answer_text": "Minecraft: Anything can run it decently for the past several years, but a decent graphics card means high draw distances and a decent processor generates scenes faster. Skyrim: you still want a decent graphics card and not a cheapie processor. GAMEBRYO, the game engine,is a little rough on memory usage and culling, so this is more beef. Fallout : 1, 2, 3, Tactics, New Vegas will all run on anything modern. Fallout 4 and 76 need a gaming computer or at least a strong video card. ",
