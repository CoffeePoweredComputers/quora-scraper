            "answer_text": "From the research I did when my children were small, classical music is the best music for kids to listen to when young. Mozart is supposed to be especially good! I think exposing your children to any music is a good idea. A wide range of different music won\u2019t hurt your child but will help your child expand their musical preferences. The fact that music is backed up by math, by counting beats, helps the brain in learning somehow. And listening to music makes life more fun. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s an amateur answer: No. Though not a pediatrician, or early childhood expert, I can tell you I played classical piano while my children were in utero. They also heard the cadences of my speech, and the rock and roll my husband adores. There were times my husband and I spoke to my growing belly. We were not expecting any understanding; baby\u2019s brain is too undeveloped. But we conveyed gentleness, beauty, and love. Let that follow you all of your parenting years. ",
