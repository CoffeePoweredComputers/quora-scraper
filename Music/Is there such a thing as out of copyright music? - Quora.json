            "answer_text": "U.S. perspective Short Answer Yes, it is possible for music \u2018s copyright to expire. Longer Answer This question has a somewhat complicated answer because: \u201cMusic\u201d can refer to a musical composition (a literary work) or a sound recording.Duration of copyright may depend on whether the work was published and whether the copyright was registered.Cornell University has a great summary of copyright durations at Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States. Examples of what we can learn there: Pre-1923 literary works registered or first published in the U.S. now are in the public domain. (For more information, please see How Old Can a Copyrighted Work Be?)Many sound recordings that are recent enough to have federal copyright protection will retain that protection until the middle of the 21st century.",
