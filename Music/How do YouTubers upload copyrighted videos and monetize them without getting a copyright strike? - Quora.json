            "answer_text": "You can not monetize a video that is flagged as copyrighted by someone else. However, in some cases, you certainly can upload copyrighted videos and YouTube will send an email, but they do not penalize you. I have heard sometimes they send an email that does penalize you, but I\u2019ve uploaded dozens of copyrighted songs with no penalty. I don\u2019t know what the difference is, why I am able to do it, but others can\u2019t. Once again, even if YouTube allows you to upload the video, which they may, they will not let you monetize it, because they will monetize it themself. So, when you see the ad running on the video, the money is not going to the channel. The reasoning is based on YouTube\u2019s interest in having a full music catalog, which is not perfectly in sync with the site\u2019s original design, and name (You- TUBE, which is a VIDEO site). At some point, they simply realized they had a more complete music catalog than Spotify, and more diverse. So now they have \u201cYouTube Music.\u201d They already had all the songs, uploaded by users. Same way Google built 3-D cities in their \u201cEarth\u201d program - by allowing users to submit the content, and paying no-one for doing all the uploads. Consider all the material from artists who recorded pre-YouTube, like old James Taylor songs. They\u2019re all in there, most of them with no valid video content whatsoever, and none of them uploaded by YouTube or James Taylor. All user contributed content. If you\u2019re wondering why I can do it, I\u2019m not sure, but I\u2019ll give you a few details about what I do, and it may be different than what you\u2019ve tried. First, I have 18-thousand subscribers and have been running a channel for years; that might make a difference. However, the bulk of my growth was due to a multi-million view video I posted of a French singer (Alizee), content which I thought was terrific (and others agreed!), but which I don\u2019t own the rights to. When I posted that video, YouTube was changing. In previous years I did get videos taken down every now and then. But in the past few years, YouTube\u2019s monitoring (Shazam-style) of uploaded \u201cmusic\u201d (even in the background) has gotten more sophisticated, and their agreements with license holders have become vastly widespread. Those things seem to be related to the change. In the past five years or more, I have never had a violation. I do get an email that informs me I can\u2019t monetize the video, but YouTube cut me off from monetization years-ago in a strange way (a different story altogether)! These days, I often create high-quality videos of bands. The emails I receive are not copyright strikes (screenshot of email below):  So, to answer your question, two things: First, you can\u2019t monetize - no channel owner can; Santana will monetize it through his agency. Second, how do some people do it? I don\u2019t know, but I do it all the time! Here\u2019s a shameless link to my YouTube channel: Music Video Network. Hope that helps; happy uploading!

            "answer_text": "Well, Youtube is everyone,s favourite platrom and we want to add videos on it without any hinderance . When I was new to Youtube , same question arises in my mind because whenever i uploaded a copyrighted video on youtube , I instantly received a copyright strike from the owner of the video/music, resulting into the bad impressions on my channel , automatically affects my earnings and lot of fear regarding shutting dwon of the channel. Now , how can we use copyrighted video on youtube . We see on youtube , there are lot of peoples using copyrighted videos and earn lot of money, best way to do this is, Download a video editor, with lots of sounds effects, screen editorEdit the video, remove some sound from the video, especially songs and more,Add some effects to the video, like overlay etcChange the tune of video using, using equalizerMake sure don,t use copyrighted overlay/music for more than 30 seconds.. Publish it on Youtube , but dont use category like films and animation, entertainment .Another way is you can add music from the official youtube site or app which is free to use. Yes, you can add a full song in your video without getting a copyright strike if you edit your video using youtube editor and there is music library in youtube from which you can music which is licensed there. Hope this will help you. p.s. Suggest some better way if you know. ",
