            "answer_text": "Hit or Flop are just another terms for the financial success of a film e.g. Profit or Loss. In terms of Indian films to determine the profit or loss is little complicate.There are lots of points to consider before giving a theatrical verdict to a film.  Films are made by producers (in financial terms). Sometimes producers themselves are the distributors of the film (Like Yashraj, Dharma Reliance, Eros etc.) Sometimes Producers sell the film to the distributors (Individual Producers like Bonny Kapoor, Vashu Bhagnani etc. prefers this) and secure their profit. In the second case, The film is always a hit for the producers as they have already earned from the film. Still theatrical verdict matters, because it adds credits or discredits to their future projects.Now, the distributors spend a good amount of money on the marketing and promotion of the film. Now days, Promotion is one of the key factors to make a film hit or flop. Generally, distributors spend 10-20 Cr. on the promotions. Now the amount distributors paid to the producers and promotion amount, Sum of the both is the new cost of the film. Distributors sell various rights (Like satellite rights, Music right etc.) and try to secure as much amount as they can. Distributors sell the film to sub-distributors of various film territories. Presently, presently territories for distribution of Hindi films are divided into eleven territories and one oversees territory. Sub-distributors sell the film to the theater owners. Whatever film earns by selling the tickets is known as Gross income. Whatever theater earns, first they pay 20% Entertainment tax to government. (Single screens as well as Multiplexes) After paying Entertainment Tax, Theater owners share the earnings with distributors. It depends on the nature of theater. In most of the cases, it is like25:75 (Single Screen theater owner : Distributor) (Varies 20:80 or 30:70) and Multiplex owner : Distributor Week 1 - 50:50Week 2 - 60:40Week 3 - 70:30Later - same as week 3(Subject to terms of agreement) 8. Now,whatever amount distributors get is known as Net income. If the Net income(selling of tickets and rights) is more than the cost (Amount paid to the producer + Promotions) film will be declare as hit otherwise film will be a flop. The difference of the amount between Cost and Net income will define the terms -  Flop,Super-flop, Hit, Super-hit, and Blockbuster etc.  ",

            "answer_text": "Money. The collections of movie decide whether it is a hit or flop.  A movie should make profit for producers and distributors to consider it a hit.  Take an example. Suppose a movie named X is made at a cost of 20 crores. This means the producer invested his 20 crores in the movie. Nowadays, the trend is to sell the movie to distributors such as reliance entertainment, yash Raj films, Eros etc. Movies with good star cast sells at good price. Usually, producers don't get share of profit or loss in such scenario.  Suppose distributors pay 35 crore for the movie X. And then invest another 10 crore on its promotion. So the cost is now 45 crores.  Now, these distributors 'distribute' the movie to regional distributors who, in turn, distribute it to theatres. Now the collection is distributed among these 3 tiers.  For a distributor to recover 45 crores, the movie should collect about 80 crores. If it earns anything above this, this will be considered hit. It should also be noted that the movie also earns through satellite rights, music etc. ",

A movie that does not make enough money (profit) for it\u2019s makers is designated a flop. On the basis of this criteria, the audience alone makes a movie a hit or a flop. You can make the best movie out there, deserving Academy or Filmfare awards and it will still be qualified as a flop because not enough people saw it. On the other hand, you can make a trashy movie with bad critic reviews and it can still turn out to be a hit because the audience turned out to watch it in troves. Everything else - script, performances, plot, direction - is at the mercy of the audience. As harsh as it sounds, it\u2019s a sad reality of the film business. ",

Story and Projection: No matter what the era is, is it 1915 or 2016, story and projection is something which makes any film successful. Right now we have that kind of visual effects and editing technique which don't have any match from past but it does not mean that every movie is successful. So for me story/content is the prime things. ",

These days its generally either the critics or the people who are into the \u2018business\u2019 of movies are the ones that declare whether a movie is a hit or a flop.In general terms, if a movie makes more money than what has been spent on making it and marketing it, the movie is declared to be a hit depending upon by what margin it has made profit. If it fails to make more money, then it is considered to be a flop.Sometimes, its also the expectations that matter. Like, say for example, a movie was expected to garner more money, but it is unable to, it might be declared a flop, even though it might have made profit. ",

            "answer_text": "Your vision. Your dedication. And of course hard work. Texhnically, if you do a good amount of work during your pre production and plan a lot of things through the production and post production phases then there is a lovely chance of success. Showing the needed rather than the wanted will grant you success. Making relatable cinema but not too much. Deep music, intriguing characters and out of this world cinematography also are key. And then if you have a solid team to work with, it's key lime pie for you. Sweet. All in all, it takes a lot to make a great hit. Believing in the project and putting what you see within onto the screen is primary. ",

If you ask this same question even to the greatest minds in film making, they may give you suggestions, but am pretty sure even they cant give you the right answer!! This is because, the greatest gamblers in the movie business are the audience and we never know which movie they like. Of course the good publicity and other stuff may pull audience to theaters, but they cannot guarantee the success. Cheers ",

If someone claims to know this reason, s/he is either foolish or missing out on an opportunity to be very very wealthy, by being a soothsayer for the producers and studios. Many have tried to evolve some kind of formula for what kind of movie will be successful, monetarily that is. The simplest observation I have made is that if a movie satisfies the expectation it has created for most of its audiences, it has a better chance of being profitable. ",
