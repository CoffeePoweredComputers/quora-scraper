            "answer_text": "Listen to loads of music in loads of different styles. Make time to listen to stuff you think you don\u2019t like. Make time to listen to stuff you don\u2019t know. Listen to everything and if you don\u2019t like it, listen to it more. And write loads of music too. I mean, just keep writing - even if it sounds derivative or copycat. Keep doing it over and over, and keep listening and thinking too. And eventually (and rather paradoxically) your own personal style will emerge in your work. There are no shortcuts and there\u2019s no substitute for just \u201cshowing up\u201d. Day in day out, you need worthwhile and meaningful encounters with music. If you can\u2019t write on any particular day (and I\u2019m afraid that happens to us all), feed your imagination by listening and studying. The other way - to hide away from other people\u2019s music and indeed from your own creativity - will not work. I guarantee it. ",

            "answer_text": "Alexis, if ur melody sounds like an already existing song, ur just assimilating it into ur brain. Obviously you don\u2019t wanna end up like Harrison with My Sweet Lord. I mean i wasn\u2019t there when he wrote it, but jeez, it really was very very close, I think he had to settle in court with whoever wrote He\u2019s So Fine. Remember that a melody can be treated in a zillion different ways, so it doesn\u2019t matter. Take Beethoven\u2019s 9th. Ode to Joy. It wud be fun to write ur own chordal structure around it. Ur second question is more difficult to answer as i don\u2019t know what \u2018style\u2019 ur into. ",

The only way you can clear space for your \u201cown\u201d melodies is by giving the ones that crop up unexpectedly some life. Sing it under your breath, write it down, try to set some lyrics to it or find an ensemble that gives it its best life, and if nothing happens, no big deal, ideas are cheap. It\u2019s what we do with them that matters. ",
