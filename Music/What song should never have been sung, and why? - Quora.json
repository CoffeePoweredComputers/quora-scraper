            "answer_text": "The National Anthem of the United States: \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d.  First, it\u2019s unsingable. Given the octave-and-a-half range, it\u2019s usually a painful embarrassment to listen to no matter who attempts to sing it. The bigger problem is it\u2019s all about war: O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;O say does that star-spangled banner yet waveO'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? Granted, it\u2019s about a British bombardment during the War of 1812. However, it should not be the subject of a national anthem that strives for lofty ideals of peace and brotherhood. But then it gets much worse, offensively so: Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution.No refuge could save the hireling and slaveFrom the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave. How appalling is that? It\u2019s little known that it was only adopted in 1931. \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\" was commonly used before that and has, ironically, the identical melody to \"God Save the Queen\". Also, among the contenders before 1931 was \"America the Beautiful\", which is really the unofficial anthem of the United States (as \u201cJerusalem\u201d is for England). It is a song that celebrates natural beauty, national pride, and humanity. ",

Maybe sew her mouth shut? Superglue? I don't know I reckon she could rent herself out to a nice Irish Noble family castle as the resident banshee? ",
