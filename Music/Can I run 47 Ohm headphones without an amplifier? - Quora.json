            "answer_text": "Usually headphone and earphone has 32ohms drivers/speaker. Now mobile phone's 3.5mm output signal is somewhat less powerful than a laptop or desktop 3.5mm audio out. So you might need a preamplifier device, example NE5534 amplifier, (with a 9v supply, usually) if you use 47ohm driver with your mobile phone. If you use those speakers with laptop, you may not require any preamplifier. There are a many preamplifier designs over the Google. ",

            "answer_text": "Yess surely you can drive with ur smartphones... But there will be some slack soft muffled sound from ur smartphone or ipod. Connect it to a laptop to get its best output .If u want max output from jolly good audio technicas ,try using amplifier but i think it may kill the portability pro. I think senhiessers HD 461 can go with your ipod or smarthphone.Good luck! ",
