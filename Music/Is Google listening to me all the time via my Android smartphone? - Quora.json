            "answer_text": "First, if I'm taking this question literally, I'll say no, your smartphone cannot listen to you, your smartphone has no ears. P.S. Please do not troll me for that last answer, I've had many people ask me if Google is eavesdropping via their smartphone? If I say yes, I get \u201cOhmygodohmygodohmygod!\u201d, And that is followed by some serious paranoia. Calming a frantic human is no easy task, it takes willing arms, the ability to act motherly to a person twice your age, and with half your intelligence. If the honest approach brings hysterics, I can understand why, I'm a very private person, I often react before I know why? Therefore, I have to take the phycological approach, and I add my personal version of psychology, which isn't like textbook psychology, I'm developing cures for the emotional reactions that make you suffer, and teaching people about actions and reactions, so they can change their part of the conversation, and lead the rest of the words out. Google assistant, and whoever makes Siri (I'm 100% Android,) I keep Google in check, if they do something even slightly offensive, I contact Googlepex and we correct it to together. We're in what they refer to as \u201cthe age of surveillance\u201d, even writing that phrase makes me worry. But it's going from bad to worse, with him watching me watching you watching him? And within that trio, none of them realize they are being filmed while secretly filming someone else. All of which, just FYI, is illegal. For the average normal person, you must get permission to fillm them, if nothing else, you have to tell them. The same law protects you, and you refuse or say no, they aren't allowed to film you, or even accidentally wind up with you in the background of what they filmed? If someone records you or your voice on tv, film, photo, or your voice on any type of recording device -especially smartphones, and their so very sweet Google Assistant? They didn't give her a very interesting name, here's Siri's best friend/fierce competition, Google Assistant..? It's a little hard to take things seriously, or be overly worried with Ms Assistant gotcha back. I'm working with her on conversations and navigating maps. There have been many times I've been talking to someone, and I turn to pick up my phone, and I see that it's been recording? When I look to see what was recorded, and it's gibberish, it's been searched as is, an there's a message from assistant saying she was unable to decipher my request, maybe we should retry\u2026 I have yelled at Assistant, I have chewed her out, called her every name in the book, and she looked that up too. The results weren't pretty. But I'll admit, all that animosity shouted at A.I., is virtual stupidity. I have a bad habit of taking my frustration out on inademit objects, and for that I say this is stupid, I'm not harming anything or anybody. On the flip side, all my assistant does with whatever she recorded is search for info and send it to me, that paranoid feeling is a normal reaction, I hate it too, that cold burning adrenaline, gives me shivers. In conclusion, Google doesn't listen, they occasionally record you for you, and it goes nowhere. If it still has it you worried, remember the legal side of this, it's on your side? The last thing Google wants is another court case, and they will settle quickly. I don't think it'll come to that, but in any case, I would like to tell you not to worry, but I'll have to add be careful, and, inevitably, we just have to get used to it, or be a leader and change things for the better, like me, that's why I'm here, I heard a calling, and I'm trying to save the world, one way or another. It's becoming quite a challenge. ",

            "answer_text": " All devices especially Android devices are incomplete without Google. Google LLC is an American multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related services and products, which include online advertising technologies, search engine, cloud computing, software and hardware. Devices such as smartphones, tablets, PCs, laptops, speakers and even vehicles are supported by Google. It is found that Google can record the conversations of people who are around the devices. The company quietly records many of the conversations that people have around its products. Some of your most intimate conversations might be sitting in a Google data center, somewhere. One must have experienced that he/she may find certain ads while using his/her phone about the things he/she was discussing with someone when use of phone was not involved directly. Though, I believe that it would be well-secured and not misused. These recordings may also be used by government or intelligence for security purposes. Google could have a record of everything you have said around it for years, and you may or may not listen to it yourself. The feature works as a way of letting people search with their voice, and storing those recordings presumably lets Google improve its language recognition tools as well as the results that it gives to people. Some reports say that we can actually listen and delete the audio files recorded. Google uses it's virtual assistant (Google Assistant) and voice search (Google Voice) applications to record the conversations. These applications use the mic installed in the devices. Also, Google reports that it records only the data said after saying 'Okay Google' to your device if you have enabled the service. But, I believe that in some cases, just saying 'okay' in conversation prompted it to switch on your phone and record around twenty seconds of audio. It may record even without saying anything like \u2018okay\u2019 or \u2018Google\u2019. After recording, these files are saved to their backup cloud storage. For security purposes, the easiest way to stop Google recording everything is to turn off the virtual assistant and never to use voice search. You may find your recordings on http://www.history.google.com/hi...website once you sign in. Though, this link may not work anymore. Note: This information may not be 100% correct and I am not blaming or accusing any company or community. I'm not even diverting anyone, just putting my views. ",
