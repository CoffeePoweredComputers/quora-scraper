            "answer_text": "TikTok TikTok app carries about 182MB in file size on installation and eventually hoards more space (app data + cache ) depending on your usage. At present, the app measures over 300MB on my phone.The TikTok app has a circular icon with black background.TikTok app boasts of an endless array of sounds, visual effects, and transitions that are impressive. If you like a specific video, you can make your own version by tapping on Album Art > Record.TikTok Lite TikTok Lite is smaller at 30MB. Clubbing the app data and cache data rakes up its storage size to around 125MB.The Lite version carries a square one with a white background.The lite versions of apps remove the clutter and provide just the core functions. Though, the app description for TikTok Lite promises a creative studio (and many things more), the Upload function doesn't work. A tap on the Upload option in TikTok Lite displays a message that the upload function will be introduced in a later update.So the Lite version is perfect if you have a phone with limited internal storage.

            "answer_text": "TikTok Lite is an app that is specially designed for developing countries that have slower internet speed. From the app size to the cache size, the system demand for the app is very low. This will ensure better performance and a better experience for the user.  There are minute differences in the interface and icon buttons. Mostly in color. Tiktok lite does not have so much clutter and has only core functions in the upload section. However creative studio does not work in the Tiktok lite app. They are still Beta testing it. They will have more updates in the future. So to upload the videos using the creative studio, you will have to wait. It is a major disappointment. The recording option is also absent in Tik Tok lite. Further, privacy options are also very less. Tikcode is absent. As of now, Tiktok lite is miserable for content creators. For content consumers, it can be a decent option if you have low internet speed. We will have to wait for updates. ",
