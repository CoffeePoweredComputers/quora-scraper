            "answer_text": "While I don\u2019t own that particular bass I do have a similar Squier Vintage Modified short scale Jaguar Bass and I think it\u2019s adequate. The Affinity series is a budget line within the budget Squier brand and is typically intended to be a somebody\u2019s \u201cfirst\u201d bass. Since you\u2019ve been playing for a year already I\u2019d think you\u2019d be ready for something a bit higher end than that. Is your current bass functional and playable? If so, I\u2019d wait and either save up some more money for a better bass or try to find something decent come along in the used market If I was looking to buy a new bass for about $200.00 with the PJ pickup configuration I\u2019d probably buy a Yamaha TRBX174. The Yamaha has better quality control and features. ",

Eventually, you may be end up frustrated with it being a Squier and not a Fender Funny thing , Whenever I sit in with someone new, they always ask what kind of bass I play. What if I suck, but I have an American Elite 5 string? I must be real good right? Wrong. I play a modded MIM Fender Jazz, and I am not ashamed of taking it out anywhere. Use what you got, and make your music ",
