            "answer_text": "A guitar isn\u2019t any octaves. The question is how many octaves RANGE does a guitar have. Depends on the guitar in question, and how its tuned. Standard six string guitar in standard tuning has four octaves, and most of a fifth. If the guitar has 24 frets, from the open low E, to the highest E at the 24th fret of the high e string gives you five full octaves. If you tune the lowest string down, you can add another step. If you tune the highest string UP (not recommended) you can potentially add more. And of course if you have an instrument with more than six strings, you can add range, accordingly. ",

            "answer_text": "From the open 6th string (E) to the fourth string, second fret, is one octave. From the fourth string, second fret, to the open 1st string is another. Holding the 1st string at the 12th fret makes a third octave.After that, it's a matter of how the guitar is constructed (e.g., with cutaways) to extend beyond the third octave. ",
