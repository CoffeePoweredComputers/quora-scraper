            "answer_text": "I hate love songs too. I love Ed Sheeran, I love his vocals, his attitude, himself. But I just can\u2019t get myself to put his songs on my phone because all of them are about stupid, bloody love. No, I\u2019m not bitter. No, I\u2019m not divorced and neither are my parents. And no, I\u2019ve never been in a relationship before but I have liked people. I\u2019m 18, and find it stupid when I turn on the radio to hear \u201cNO. We are never, ever, ever, getting back together\u201d or \u201cshe looks so perfect standing there\u2026\u201d *insert more romantic song lyrics* I might like the tune of the song, and the vocals, but I just hate the lyrics. I also hate songs about break ups, first loves, sexy someone, anything love. On the other hand, I like songs that explore deep meanings or try to encourage people. Songs like \u201cBrave\u201d by Sara Bareilles, and \u201cScars to your beautiful\u201d by Alessia Cara. Even K-pop, songs by BTS like \u201cCypher pt 4\u201d, \u201cyoung forever\u201d and \u201cPied Piper\u201d. I don\u2019t speak Korean, but I like the sound of their songs, and I like the meanings behind their lyrics when I google it, and I\u2019m sold! ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s got to be tough! The majority of the songs recorded in any genre ARE about love from some kind of angle - falling in love, lost love, betrayed love, self-love, falling out of love, being in love, physical love, friendship love, toxic love, new love, long-term love, family love, love of nature, planet or ecosystem. You\u2019re probably referring to the corny love ballad type of songs in which case, there are definitely some I could\u2019ve done without! One that was popular in the 1980s was by the group REO Speedwagon called \u201cI Just Wanna Keep On Loving You\u201d. I can\u2019t tell you how much I STILL cringe when I hear that! \u201cI don\u2019t wanna sleep, I just wanna keep on loving you\u201d Cringing again. Pretty much anything by them has that effect! ",
