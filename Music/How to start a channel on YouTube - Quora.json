            "answer_text": "Blog-videos are growing and becoming popular in the world, young people are more and more attracted by the idea of starting a new Youtube channel is completely understandable. I never thought I would do YouTube, but like many other young people, I started building my own Youtube channel. And I realized that in order to build a successful Youtube channel, you need to note some of the following aspects: Plan Your ContentBefore even creating your YouTube channel, you\u2019ve probably already decided on the kind of video content that you want to show. The best ways to increase your views and gain followers is still to keep your content interesting and engaging; the more people can relate to it, the more they\u2019ll want to click on it and watch until the end.  2. Arm Yourself with the Right Equipment DSLR or mirrorless cameras, along with other accessories for videography such as tripods, lenses, and studio lighting are essential devices and you should invest in these low-power devices.  Besides, for the YouTubers who frequently travel, you need more a mirrorless or action camera and a good monopod or handheld gimbal stabilizer are typical gear staples. 3. Look for Inspiration When you have been running YouTube for a while, you will encounter a difficulty that has no new ideas for your videos. This is not your own problem that many YouTubers encounter. The way to maintain that inspiration is looking for inspiration everywhere\u2014even when you\u2019re out and taking a break from recording. List down your ideas. Check out other videos and build upon their ideas to make them your own. 4. Start with Simple Editing Software To edit video content you need some editing software such as Final Cut Pro. However, this software is quite difficult to use for beginners. In the first few weeks, you should use simpler software like Windows Movie Maker or Apple iMovie and they can be downloaded (free of charge) if you do not already have one on your computer.  5. Optimize Your Videos This means that as soon as you upload your first video to your YouTube channel, set a good descriptive title that viewers can write on the search bar and make sure to include your main keyword or keyword phrase. For example, guide makeup trends in 2019 better than makeup ",

            "answer_text": "There are a few basic pieces of equipment you want to have when starting a YouTube channel. Some of these are necessary depending on what kinds of videos you want to make and some are recommended if you want to make better videos. You can honestly start a YouTube channel only using your phone to record, edit, and upload your content but that is not advised. Here are the basic piece of equipment you\u2019ll want when starting a channel: A camera to record your videos with. Depending on what kinds of videos you make you may want to have a better camera or a different type of camera. You can get an inexpensive camera for a couple hundred bucks but always try and get the highest quality camera for your budget. If you\u2019re starting out, I\u2019d recommend a Canon or Sony camcorder. I really like the Canon Vixia series which is what I started on before upgrading to a Canon DSLR. Like I previously stated though, depending on the videos you make though you might want to get a different kind of camera like a GoPro or a slow motion camera or maybe even a webcam.A solid computer with editing software. A good computer always helps make post production much easier. Most computers come with editing software installed already as well. I\u2019ve used just about every piece of software available for video editing but honestly iMovie is awesome and can do just about everything you need when starting a channel. As you improve I would recommend upgrading your editing software, I personally use Adobe Premiere Pro which you can use on both Mac and PC.A microphone is really helpful as it allows you to capture better audio. People often underestimate the importance of good audio in online videos but having bad audio is just as bad as having low quality video. You may want a simple shotgun microphone or lavalier microphone if you are recording people and vlogs. You may want to pick up a desktop or USB microphone if you are recording commentary or voice overs.If you want to start a gaming channel you\u2019ll want something like a capture card or screen recording software to record your gameplay as well. You may want to also purchase a camera or webcam to record yourself as well if you are running a gaming channel but it is important to get something to record your gameplay. ",
