            "answer_text": "Honestly I think it\u2019s strange to only be into one genre of music. I love a lot of music myself. I\u2019m not really into rap or most operas but I do enjoy some classical. I\u2019ve always listened to a wide range of music, rock, blues, jazz, country (I prefer older country), pop (I usually prefer older pop too) and rockabilly are my most common mixes I listen to but I throw in other things too as the mood hits me and there\u2019s music I like that I don\u2019t really know how to put in any genre. There\u2019s so many great songwriters, musicians and bands out there it seems like a waste not to give them a listen and appreciate the talent they have. I think it\u2019s weird NOT to like all kinds of music personally. ",
