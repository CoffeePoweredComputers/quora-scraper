            "answer_text": "Between 1964 and 1970, Eric Clapton played on a number of very good records: The Yardbirds, Five Live Yardbirds. This 1964 live album of the blues-based beat group that Clapton was lead guitarist of, is one of the most raucous and energetic things he ever did, and his playing is one of the reasons why that\u2019s so. He was only 18 at the time (he turned 19 ten days after it was recorded) but he plays his ass off. It\u2019s hardly sophisticated music. It\u2019s the sound of five very young men, full of piss and hormones and imported blues records and, probably, cheap English beer, but it\u2019s the main document of why Clapton was so revered as a very young player. Around this time he made a number of studio recordings with them which did very little action, but \u2018Got to Hurry\u2019 and \u2018I Ain\u2019t Got You\u2019 feature guitar playing from him which was, by 1964 English standards, savage. (Indeed, even if we compare it to late 50s blues guitar by people like Otis Rush and Guitar Slim, it stands up very well.) But Clapton wasn\u2019t happy in the Yardbirds, and they weren\u2019t happy with him.John Mayall, Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton. Clapton left the Yardbirds in 1965 after they recorded their first hit, \u2018For Your Love\u2019, either because he was disgusted with their commercial approach or because he didn\u2019t have the imagination to find a way of working within it\u2014you decide. Anyway, he joined the band of English bluesman John Mayall, and commenced a period of serious practice and listening, aided by Mayall\u2019s immense collection of blues and jazz records. In March-April 1966 the band recorded this, their only studio album with Clapton on guitar. Clapton\u2019s playing is truly \u2018outstanding\u2019, both in the sense that he\u2019s playing really well and eloquently, and that, with the exception of the great Alan Skidmore on tenor sax, he\u2019s an embarrassingly better musician than anyone else on the album. I can\u2019t really listen to this anymore, because Mayall\u2019s reedy voice and the rather lumpen rhythm section of John McVie (later of Fleetwood Mac) and Hughie Flint aren\u2019t very good. But Clapton\u2019s aggressive tone, dexterity and inventiveness are still miles ahead of those of peers. It\u2019s like listening to a great diva singing before a nondescript orchestra. In the Yardbirds Clapton played with lots of attack and a fairly brittle, twangy tone, but he was learning to slow down and use feedback and amplification to help himself play long sustained tones, making himself sound (as one critic put it) like some strange woodwind instrument operated by strings.John Mayall and Eric Clapton, \u2018Lonely Years\u2019. This 1966 single was recorded by Mayall and Clapton alone on vocals/harmonica and guitar, and it sounds like it was recorded in a toilet. It\u2019s also one of the best things they ever did, with Mayall sounding like a real blues singer and Clapton holding down a filthy groove all by himself. Their guitar/harp duet is rough and ready, but really enjoyable.Cream, Fresh Cream. By the time Blues Breakers came out, Clapton had already left John Mayall and formed Cream with Scottish bass player Jack Bruce and London drummer Ginger Baker, who\u2019d played with each other in the largely instrumental band the Graham Bond Organisation and\u2014ominously\u2014not got on with each other. But they wanted to play with the best, so Baker invited Clapton into the band, and Cream played its first gig in July 1966. Bruce was, as they say, a triple threat: besides being a virtuoso bass player he was a great singer and fine, inventive songwriter, but Cream had a lack of songs, so from their earliest gigs they would fill out performances with long improvisations. This became their trademark, and was one of their most important contributions to rock. Fresh Cream is a somewhat bumpy record, a mixture of Bruce\u2019s quirky, heavy rock songs and blues numbers, but it has a stark, chiaroscuro quality, partly because there were only three of them. Clapton plays exceptional solos on \u2018Sweet Wine\u2019 and cover versions of Skip James\u2019s \u2018I\u2019m So Glad\u2019 and Willie Dixon\u2019s \u2018Spoonful\u2019, showing that he\u2019s developing a vocabulary less rooted in blues and more in melodic exploration.Cream, Disraeli Gears. Cream\u2019s second album from 1967 represented the first time Clapton had managed to stay in a band for more than one album, and also showed the influence of Jimi Hendrix. Hendrix had formed his own trio (the Jimi Hendrix Experience) partly under the influence of Cream, and Clapton, along with all the other British musicians of his generation, had been blown away by Hendrix\u2019s musicianship, showmanship and charisma. Disraeli Gears is also swirling with LSD, from Martin Sharp\u2019s cover to tracks like the dreamy and ominous \u2018Dance the Night Away\u2019, \u2018SWLABR\u2019 and \u2018Tales of Brave Ulysses\u2019, on which Clapton has clearly bought a wah-wah pedal and can only think of one thing to do with it. But if any one album shows the splendid Technicolor weirdness of 1967-vintage psychedelic heavy rock, it\u2019s this. Clapton does very fine work on Bruce\u2019s sorrowful \u2018We\u2019re Going Wrong\u2019, and there are amusingly Beatle-ish moments on the cheerfully nonsensical shuffle \u2018Take It Back\u2019 and Cockney singalong \u2018Mother\u2019s Lament\u2019. But the standout track is the anthemic, extraordinary (and remarkably concise) \u2018Sunshine of Your Love\u2019, which somehow takes a lover\u2019s promise to be home soon and makes it sound like a threat.Cream, Wheels of Fire. The band\u2019s third album, from 1968, shows off its Janus-faced quality. In the studio, Cream made carefully constructed rock songs with meticulous production and arrangements, but live, they played endless blues-flavoured jams. The first disc of Wheels of Fire features more of Bruce\u2019s inventive songwriting: \u2018White Room\u2019 and \u2018Deserted Cities of the Heart\u2019 are as good as anything the band ever did. Ginger Baker\u2019s songwriting, which had previously been the embarrassing low point of Cream albums, dramatically improved: \u2018Those Were the Days\u2019 is a great song. Clapton\u2019s main contribution was an almost note-for-note cover of Albert King\u2019s \u2018Born Under A Bad Sign\u2019, which is at least as good as the original. \u2026Aaaaand then there\u2019s the live stuff. \u2018Crossroads\u2019 is the high point, a blistering gallop through Robert Johnson\u2019s blues song, featuring two of the greatest, most intense solos Clapton ever played, and one of his best vocal performances. \u2018Traintime\u2019, a vocal & harp/drum duet between Bruce and Baker, is thrilling. But you may find yourself listening to the endless modal noodling in \u2018Spoonful\u2019, and Baker\u2019s relentless battering of his drums in \u2018Toad\u2019, and wondering how much more of your life this is going to consume.Before and during the making of Wheels of Fire, Cream began to fall apart. Bruce and Baker really disliked each other, and Clapton (who was the youngest member) was getting sick of having to mediate between them. The band was getting louder and louder, and having to play endless solos night after night was taking its toll. The Beatles, \u2018While My Guitar Gently Weeps\u2019, from The Beatles. In September 1968, the Beatles were recording the White Album and, like Cream, were not getting along. Clapton had become a close friend of the Beatles\u2019 lead guitarist George Harrison, and during a car ride to London, Harrison asked Clapton to play lead guitar on his song \u2018While My Guitar Gently Weeps\u2019. Clapton declined, feeling that \u2018nobody plays on Beatle records\u2019, but then was persuaded. Clapton\u2019s presence in the studio had the effect of making the other Beatles more friendly and cooperative, and the result was one of their best-loved tracks. I\u2019m not crazy about it myself, but Beatles fans generally love its combination of Harrisonian sincerity and Claptonian fire.Cream, Goodbye. Before Wheels of Fire had even been released, Cream announced that they were splitting up. Their last album (1969) was like a skinny remake of the previous one, with a couple of turgid live tracks and a side of studio numbers, but one of them, \u2018Badge\u2019, co-written by Clapton and Harrison, was a bittersweet gem and one of his best songs.By 1969, Clapton\u2019s personal life was in turmoil: basically, he\u2019d fallen in love with his best friend\u2019s wife. It was traumatic enough for a blues musician to find himself the main character in a real-life country song, but it didn\u2019t help that the friend in question was George Harrison and the wife in question was Patti Harrison, n\u00e9e Boyd, a celebrated model and the inspiration for Harrison\u2019s finest song, \u2018Something\u2019. After the breakup of Cream, Clapton flailed around a bit and formed a short-lived supergroup, Blind Faith, with Baker, Steve Winwood of Traffic and Ric Grech of Family, but it folded after six months and one so-so album. Around this time, he started playing with Blind Faith\u2019s support band Delaney & Bonnie, and became fascinated with the music of The Band, in particular their focus on songwriting. Delaney and Bonnie encouraged his songwriting ambitions, and he used many of their musicians on his first proper solo album, Eric Clapton. But then, wanting to make an album but also wanting to tell himself that he was a member of a proper band, he formed a new band with a name designed to distract people from who the band consisted of, and made the finest album of his career. Derek and the Dominos, Layla and other Assorted Love Songs. This album, recorded between August and October 1970 in Miami, is the one album I would recommend to anyone who doesn\u2019t get the point of Clapton. It\u2019s the only album I know of where he really got outside of himself and says something which strikes the listener\u2014well, this listener, anyway\u2014as having the force of a universal truth about people, rather than an individual truth about Clapton. The album has the feel of having been recorded by a bunch of drunk guys having a really good time, which is more or less what the sessions were actually like, except that Clapton was in the full flush of unrequited love for Patti Harrison, and he howls it out on songs like \u2018Tell the Truth\u2019, \u2018Layla\u2019 itself, and a blistering cover version of Billy Myles\u2019 \u2018Have You Ever Loved A Woman\u2019, a song which was basically telling the story of his life at that point. It helps that Clapton met Duane Allman and got him to join the sessions; Allman\u2019s ecstatic slide is all over the album, especially on a heartrending cover of Jimi Hendrix\u2019s \u2018Little Wing\u2019, reinventing Hendrix\u2019s quiet, tender song as a soaring epic. (Contrary to legend, they didn\u2019t record it as a posthumous tribute to Hendrix: he was still alive when they made it, but he died unexpectedly only days later.) The Dominoes\u2019 version of \u2018Little Wing\u2019 thereby acquired an entirely unintended elegiac quality. Layla is a sprawling mess of an album, and also a close, harrowing portrait of a man unhappily in love. Clapton never recorded anything this intense ever again.And, well\u2026that\u2019s it, as far as I\u2019m concerned. Clapton\u2019s obsession with Patti Harrison stumbled on her unwillingness to leave Harrison for him. He got himself and a girlfriend into heroin, and spent 1971\u201373 basically in seclusion, smoking (rather than injecting) the stuff and doing little, although Harrison (who, amazingly, still considered himself Clapton\u2019s best friend) dragged him out for the Concert for Bangladesh, and Pete Townshend organised a tribute concert that was meant to be getting Clapton back out in the public eye. He finally got off heroin in 1974 and Patti Harrison eventually left her husband for him. (George still didn\u2019t get seriously pissed off about this.) He released his first post-heroin solo album, 461 Ocean Boulevard, in 1974. He also started to drink heavily. In a 1976 concert in Birmingham, a very drunk Clapton made some heavily racist remarks onstage. He later shrugged this off, or tried to, but some arrogance or bloody-mindedness (or maybe just inner racism) has prevented him from ever saying straight out Look, I was wrong, I was pissed, I was stupid and I was ignorant, and I\u2019m sorry. As late as 2004, he was continuing to defend himself, rather than apologise. That would be bad enough, but as someone who, before he was ever aware of the 1976 incident, doggedly listened to everything Clapton did from 1964 to 1990 or so, I can personally testify that his 70s and 80s output is, for the most part, one vast snooze: the sound of a man who no longer felt like he needed to be challenged, but who played music because he didn\u2019t know what else to do. He eventually managed to kick the booze as well, and for the last couple of decades he\u2019s presented himself as a sort of sharp-dressed, clean-living CEO of The Blues: a maker of music for middle-aged men to listen to in expensive cars. The kind of guy who makes a guest appearance on Top Gear, which indeed he did do, in 2013. Little he\u2019s done has been, in my view, worth listening to. Even the very sad death of his young son in 1991 provoked him to write a song which, although heartfelt, was hardly up there with the power and intensity of his best work. But it sold a lot of copies. Cream reunited briefly in 2005 and played some enjoyable concerts. But Bruce died in 2014, so that won\u2019t happen again. Just to show that there are times, etc., here\u2019s an evident bootleg of him onstage from some point in the 70s or 80s (the video says 1978, but this is disputed). Something had clearly got into him, that night.  And in 2002, Clapton acted as musical director for Harrison\u2019s tribute concert. In that capacity, he delivered an elegy for his friend which was genuinely mournful, even when delivered through the overstuffed guitar-fest that was the celebrity band:  Clapton\u2019s second solo here, with its weeping ninths and outrageous bends and rhythmic restlessness, is I think fully up there with his best work. So, Clapton is, or can be, an eloquent musician. And if he\u2019d died in 1971, I think he\u2019d be remembered as a truly great one. It\u2019s just that he wants to be a different sort of musician than that, and he seldom bothers, in my opinion, to put himself in a situation which will prod him to stop being such a boring old fart and make him really say something. In the meantime, he has his money and his cars and his guns (he likes to hunt) and his family; he married again in 2002. There\u2019s not a lot in his life that would tend to give him the blues, these days. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I think most fans adore his playing style and tone from back from his Cream days, and his style was quite different than it is now, in terms of both guitar playing, and just general music. Back with Cream, he tended to favor a certain psychedelically painted Gibson SG known as The Fool. He was very influenced by Hendrix\u2019s playing, so of course, he went out and bought himself a Wah-Wah pedal. This was reflected in his musical style, too/ For the times, his music was very heavy and psychedelic. He was also on psychedelic drugs at the time, which is also a factor. His playing was very intense, and often quite virtuosic in nature. Fast forward a few years later, and Clapton has constructed his signature Blackie Stratocaster, lived as a farmer in rural England, and has come back with a whole new set of influences. Around this time, his playing tended to be very country-influenced, and much more melodic (not that his earlier solos weren\u2019t, just more so post 1973). Starting with 461 Ocean Boulevard, he seems to prioritize taste as opposed to incendiary skill (as evidenced by the chart topper I Shot The Sheriff, and My Father\u2019s Eyes, where the licks are still there, but they no longer take up the forefront), while still not being afraid to showcase his talent in other tracks (Cocaine and Rita Mae, among others). Although I don\u2019t think most of his solo records hold a candle to any of his Cream work (save for Slowhand, Journeyman and Unplugged), I still think that his entire repertoire contains only two or three albums that I wouldn\u2019t listen to all the way through (in case you\u2019re curious, Another Ticket, Reptile, and maybe, JUST MAYBE, August). There are still many great things to appreciate in his solo work, but not all of them are pure jaw dropping talent, although if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for, he\u2019s got several live albums that may strike your fancy. He\u2019s mostly revered as a guitar player for his earlier work, where he loved showcasing his mad chops. However, his later playing tends to be more on the melodic or emotive side, where he attempts to tell a story through his playing. Many people who see him as an amazing guitarist are those who can appreciate that, although I understand that it might not appeal to many. If such things aren\u2019t to your taste, he at least deserves a bit of credit for all the guitar players that came out of the woodwork screaming \u201cClapton Is God\u201d. Among them are two of the greatest: Jimi Hendrix, and Eddie Van Halen. Legend says that the only reason Jimi Hendrix ever even went to London was to meet Clapton, and within two days, he played an onstage jam with Cream. Another urban legend states that Eddie Van Halen heard Cream\u2019s live recording of Crossroads, and his jaw dropped to the ground. He apparently spent years searching for live bootlegs of that performance, as he didn\u2019t think anyone could play that good. For that alone, Clapton at least deserves a bit of respect. I mean, for Christ\u2019s sake, he played an hour\u2019s worth of blues solos on Unplugged without bending a single note! (It\u2019s true, listen to it, not one bend!) That right there is the sign of a phenomenal guitar player, resisting muscle memory like that #claptonisgod    ",
