            "answer_text": "I would say that the Drive-by Truckers, who I believe are still working, fall into that category, but I'm hard-pressed to come up with any others. And they're more direct descendants of the Allman Brothers than the bands you mention. Nevertheless, they do straight-up guitar, bass, and drums Rock. Good stuff - worth checking out. Although I listen to a lot of different music, when it comes to Rock, I'm a bit of a purist myself. The thing that got me into Punk Rock was the idea of getting back to basics, away from the Prog Rock direction Rock was taking at the time, again going for straight-up guitar, bass, and drums.  I grew up on the bands you mention, so was glad that bands like the Ramones and the Sex Pistols brought back the aesthetic of rocking hard. Punk, of course, devolved into Hardcore, (of which there were a couple of truly great bands - Minor Threat, Fang), so we had to wait a bit until melody returned to Rock in the late eighties, early nineties, (Mudhoney, Nirvana, and see Jes Younger's post). Of course, I'm forgetting eighties bands like the Feelies and the Replacements!  So, my point is this - while there aren't really bands that exactly sound like certain late sixties, early seventies bands, there are many working in that aesthetic. Fu Manchu and Monster Magnet sound like a band from the seventies, although no band in the seventies ever really sounded like that. And it's worth noting that, at almost any point in time, you can find great, straight-up Rock music, although the sounds evolve and change. We wouldn't want that any other way, right? The other thing is that there is a lot of great music from the late sixties, early seventies, some known, some relatively unknown, that the Classic Rock stations mostly ignore. There's a lot to explore from that original period. If you haven't already, check out: Humble Pie \"Smokin'\" Ten Years After \"A Space in Time\" Mott the Hoople \"All the Young Dudes\" T. Rex \"The Slider\" and \"Electric Warrior\" Alice Cooper (seriously!) \"Killer\" and \"Love it to Death\" ",

            "answer_text": "The great thing about living today is that there isn't one popular genre out there. And a bunch of older bands are still making new music. For example The Zombies, which came on the scene in 1965 with \"She's not There\" and \"Time of the Season\" just released a new album last year! These groups are also touring and you can get into a 500-1500 seat venue to go see them.  ",
