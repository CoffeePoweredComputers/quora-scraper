            "answer_text": "This question hinges on the larger issue of the value of copyright and the intent of the First Amendment. Here's Wikipedia's introduction:  \"The US Constitution grants Congress the power to enact copyright laws in Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 (the Copyright Clause). The Copyright Clause states that congress shall have the power: To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries. The Copyright Clause forms the basis for both U.S. copyright law (\"Science\", \"Authors\", \"Writings\") and patent law (\"useful Arts\", \"Inventors\", \"Discoveries\"), and requires that these exclusive rights expire (\"for limited Times\").\" Without this clause, there would be no incentive for writers, artists, or inventors to innovate, since the First Amendment specifies that there are no exceptions to free speech:  \"Congress shall make no law\" means just that.  No Law.  But Congress realized that along with the \"incentive\", there would have to be a time limit to this exception.  By this exception, people were allowed to profit from their intellectual work, except that after a specified time (14 years plus an extension of 14 years), the work became Public Domain.  In 1909 it added an additional 28 years, giving exclusive rights 56 years. This system was subject to misuse by publishers and other businesses (for example, the copyright was often sold to the publisher for a flat fee).  But the most egregious flaw was the current extension, passed in 1998, which extended terms to 95/120 years or life plus 70 years, thus making the end of copyright, for most purposes, useless.  Because the entertainment industry feared the passing into public domain famous/familiar characters, this is known as the \"Mickey Mouse\" extension.  Effectively, this means nothing becomes public domain for well over a century, totally counter to the original intent, which was that the inventor could profit for a period, but only for a limited time, after which anyone could do so. Thus we have the absurdity of \"Happy Birthday\" (a two-word change in the lyrics of the well-known song, \"Good Morning To You,\" commonly sung by students to the teacher at the beginning of the school day) having its rights protected until 2030.  Virtually everyone knows this is morally reprehensible, but the power of corporate lobbyists and the wealth of the entertainment industry make it impossible to change. Possibly the only positive effect of this situation is that the music industry is forced to pay for new songs in situations where the music would be in public domain.  But the threat of legal action is enough that no one challenges the law.  In any case, the law protects music in every form.  Any use of copyrighted material is subject to it, from performance on international charitable events (such as Live Aid) to a radio playing in a shoe repair shop.

            "answer_text": "Infringement has had a severe impact on the music industry. The music industry enjoyed its best year in 1999, when revenue from the sale of physical music peaked at $23.8 Billion worldwide, according to the IFPI. Then came the file sharing sites like Napster and Grokster, which had an dramatic impact on industry. In a new 2017 report, the IFPI disclosed that music revenue dropped by 40% between 1999 and 2014. The IFPI reports that global revenue at the end of 2016 was $15.8 Billion, a growth thanks in part to emerging subscription sites like Spotify. The Recording Industry Association of America reported in a 2007 study that music pirating costs the economy $12.5 Billion annually, with a lost of 71,060 jobs. These numbers spotlight the negative impact that unlawful copying has had on the music industry. ",
