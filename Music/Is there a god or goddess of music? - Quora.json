            "answer_text": "In Hindu tradition there are gods goddesses divine beings that represent performing arts (music, dance, acting) Shiv - The creator of cosmic music and dance. Even Modern String Theory considers Shiva as the symbolic representation of cosmic strings that vibrate and create the music of life at cosmic and subatomic level (CERN has Shiva statue in its campus). Instrument of Damaru (a two surface drum, representing balance of life and death) belongs to Shiv.  Ganesh - Ganesh (son of Shiva) is mostly a performer but he is attributed to creation of Musical notes, Stories and Poems (in fact he penned the longest poem on Earth, the Mahabharata). Instrument of Mridanga (again a drum but creates deep notes of sound) is associated with Ganesh. Deepness of the sound represents Ganesh is a god of Matitarth (Deep meaning of art).  Saraswati - She is the general goddess of all arts including music, painting, sculpting etc. Veena is her instrument. She is prayed by every creative artist in Indian subcontinent. She is the daughter of Brahma (creator of the world).  Radha Krishna - When a couple performs, either dances or sings duets Radha Krishna are considered to be descended into them. The instrument of Flute (basuri) and Anklet (ghungroo) are associated with this couple. Flute is associated with attraction to grihastha (family) life.  Coincidentally in the west also flute is depicted as an instrument that intoxicates humans and animals alike (remeber the western story of a flutist, rats and children?) Gandharvas like Nala, Opamana, Panada - These are divine forms of natural elements that inspire humans to create music. Water, Wind, materials like Leather etc. these gandharvas represent music in its raw form. In Indian classical, a supreme gayaka (singer) is titled as Gandharva e.g. Bal Gandharva, Kumar Gandharva.

            "answer_text": " Among the Indian divinities, I will bring out two goddesses, one from Hindu mythology and another from ancient Manipuri mythology. From Hindu mythology, Goddess Saraswati, holds a Veena (a musical instrument). She is not only the music deity, but also associated with learning and wisdom. From ancient Manipuri mythology, Goddess Nongthang Leima holds a Pena (traditional violin). She's not only the goddess of music, but also associated with thunder, lightning, charm, beauty, seduction and dance. In ancient Greek mythology, Apollo and Artemis, the twin deities are also associated with music.  Besides, among the Muses, there are deities associated with music.
