            "answer_text": "From their side job lol. For those with a decent following their money comes mostly from gigs and merch. They can also get money for featuring on other songs with other artists. Rappers tend to go from broke to rich. Unlike singers they can\u2019t get extra income from singing in a cover band or teaching singing on the side. You have to be very popular in your home town to make a living as an unsigned rapper. By that point, you might start to get the attention of a label if you\u2019re in a large enough city with a decent music scene like Atlanta. A lot of the rappers you know were grinding for a really long time before they blew up. Some blew up and stayed independent and unsigned like Macklemore and Tech N9ne for example. ",

            "answer_text": "Most rappers don\u2019t make money. Even being signed means nothing if you have a bad contract. Many people sign quickly without noticing who gets money for streaming, merch, video game royalties, and so forth. I had a label offer me a good deal on record and CD points, but they wanted all the rights to \u2018future digital media\u2019. This was before Pandora and stuff so good I didn\u2019t sign that! ",
