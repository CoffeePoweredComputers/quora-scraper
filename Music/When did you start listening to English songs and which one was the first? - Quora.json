            "answer_text": "when I was in 4th standard the 1st song I listened to was of Whigfield's super numbers SEXY EYES and SATURDAY NIGHT.i used to dance on them listen them everyday.  It was when my brother used to make a list of songs get them recorded in a cassette and that's when he bought these songs and some more English hits with these. That's when I started listening to English music.i used to enjoy it.Gradually  Avril Lavigne\"COMPLICATED\",Backstreet Boys\"U R MY FIRE,THE CALL\",Celion Dion\"THAT'S THE WAY\" and some more. During my 10th when I developed interest in rock music and started listening Eminem,linking park,Akon and used to go to cyber cafes to get lyrics of all the songs of these artists and used to learn them practicing when nobody around as my family used to say do you really understand what do they sing and they still says the same thing.during my college days i used listened to a song of Metallica for the first time it was TURN THE PAGE and it just got into my ears and then i managed to search the lyrics and used to play it day and night.Then i searched for Metallica's other songs i found my all time favorite song NOTHING ELSE MATTERS one of the best i have ever heard of.  I once sang a rap song in my family function which amazed my family but my cousins loved it. ",

            "answer_text": "Before I answer this one I wanna thank Rahul S. Rana for asking me this marvellous question.  \u200b\u200bI initially thought that the first English song I ever heard was Akon's Smackthat which was featured by Eminem, when I was somewhere in 4th Grade, from the loudspeaker next door. I didn't knew anything about who's and what's of that song and I admit that even though I had no much knowledge about English(in which I used to top back then) I was totally awestruck by the awesomeness of the rap in that track by Eminem.   \u200b\u200bWhen I reached 8th Grade my dad bought me a smartphone. Transferring random files through bluetooth was quite popular back then. One of my friends, had sent me several English tracks & Hindi DJ remixes and in those few songs I discovered a gem out of it. It was Beautiful by Eminem. The beats, the flow, the emotions and the content of that song had just made me go mad over this guy and from that day I've become a crazy and wise fan of him. I've a collection of over 100 songs of him right now in my phone's playlist. Right from Foolish Pride to Kings Never Die, I've listened to his each & every songs somebody would ever know about.  \u200b\u200bI now also listen to the artists of other genres including Green Day, Simple Plan, Michael Jackson, Nickleback, AC/DC, Sia, etc and rappers like Tupac, Biggie, Xzibit, Kendrick Lamar, 50 Cent, Tech N9ne, Immortal Technique, etc but my first priority is always Eminem.  \u200b\u200bP.S: I later realised that the first ever English song I heard was \"Murder Murder\" by Eminem himself, but I don't particularly know when.  Thanks again. ",
