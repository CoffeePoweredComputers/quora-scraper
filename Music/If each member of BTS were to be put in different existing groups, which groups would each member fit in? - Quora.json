            "answer_text": "This is interesting. Jin - Astro  Imagine Jin together with Eunwoo and Moonbin. They are extremely funny and both Jin & Eunwoo share interest in acting.  V - NCT (probably unit - U)They have like the weirdest individuals out there so adding V would be interesting. Weird. I\u2019d wonder what kind of interaction he would have with Haechan.  V in my head somehow would fit Seventh Sense.  J-hope - EXOThinking about him dancing choreos like Monster, +adding his rap would be cool.  Suga -Block BHis rap with Zico\u2019s?  Jungkook - Got7 (??????) D: Hell no but hell yeah.  Jimin - VIXXJimin performing concepts like Shangri La?  Now let\u2019s take a minute and think about what would happen if Jimin did a collab with N from VIXX. This is N.  RM - I wanted to pick Monsta X but. Winner.  Or just be solo, can imagine him working on his own things like Yongguk from BAP. Something like his album Mono. I thought it\u2019ll be harder for me to do this than it was. Out of these, Jin and Jimin are to me the easist to imagine with those groups. I thought about Jungkook with Got7 members D: and honestly I am lost but would pay for him to interact with Bambam, Jinyoung and JB lol.And I really wonder how would SM decide to present and style V if he was in NCT, I\u2019d really love to see that.

            "answer_text": "Namjoon: Maybe a group like Astro. Eunwoo is very attractive and with Namjoon in there as well I think it would be amazing Jin: A group like EXO is good too. I saw the Tempo MV and it was so stunning and the visuals and vocals might I add, were so amazing and Jin would fit in. Hoseok: A group like Stray Kids or ATEEZ since they produce mostly hyper songs and very hype raps, but they occasionally settle for a slow tempo and vocals. Jimin: VIXX. period. Jungkook: NCT127 or Stray Kids since I feel that Jungkook would add some more energy Yoongi: He would go solo since sometimes he works alone. Taehyung: Stray Kids Felix has a deep voice like Tae but I don\u2019t think he would fit in the group overall because one, His vocals are classical and deep like his solo Stigma. Taehyung would actually probably be a solo like DEAN or Sam Kim. Their voices are so deep and they collaborate with other artists such as Crush or Loco. Taehyung has a unique voice that wouldn\u2019t blend with others. Unless it\u2019s Jungkook or Jimin. ",
