            "answer_text": "The Labi Siffre song \u201cSomething Inside so Strong\u201d has massive meaning for me. I used to be physically very fit and energetic until I contracted M.E. at age 40. Suddenly every muscle in my body went on strike. I was stranded in bed facing the wall because I did not have the strength to move position. The change was unexpected and frightening, but more terrifying still was what was happening to my brain. It seemed to have changed to a dense cloud with holes drilled through it. Memories were falling through the holes and disappearing. I woke one day and wondered where I was. The room looked like some basement or junk room with odd wooden things I didn't even realise I was in a bed looking at the furniture I'd owned for years. Somewhere outside a voice was calling : \u201cMum, \u2026\u201d I've no idea what the other words were, I didn't understand them, but assumed that the owner of the voice was looking for someone whose name was Mum. Moments later a girl poked her head round the door and asked if I needed anything. This I understood, but wondered why a stranger would say this. Totally confused I muttered something and closed my eyes. The door closed and I was alone again trying to piece together who I was, who she was and what I was doing there. Other people came from time to time, bringing food and drink, asking if I was feeling any better. Gradually I remembered that I was in my upstairs bedroom and that the kind strangers were my family. Not all memories returned and other episodes robbed me of much of my past. I began to fear that my mind was going completely and that I would become a vegetable staring heedlessly into space. Siffre\u2019s song ran through my head and reminded me that no matter what was going wrong with my brain and body, my spirit would stand strong . A few weeks later I saw a neurologist who cheerfully informed me that some of my brain cells had died, taking the memories with them, so my punctured cloud vision was not so wide of the truth. Because M.E. is so little understood, I needed that strength of spirit time and again to battle towards some level of functionality, especially when my darling girl fell ill with the same condition and I had to struggle from my bed to fight school and doctors in a failed attempt to get her some support. She suffered far more than me and continues to experience prejudice from people who \u201cdon't believe\u201d in a very real and destructive illness for which there is, as yet, no cure. These \u201cunbelievers\u201d have no idea of the harm they do, especially if they are in positions of power over a sufferer. As we both learned to live with our personal difficulties and worked out ways to help each other, and friends and family began to give their support, things improved. We've now both got a pretty good life. She grew up and moved out, facing a whole new raft of challenges and I wrote half a dozen books, some with friends and a couple on my own. At 53 I went to university in hopes of retraining my brain, still inspired by the words of that song. Sadly, despite good grades, I didn't manage to complete the course before relapsing, but I did enough to achieve the next qualification down, which isn't bad for someone with holes in her brain. Here are a few of the most meaningful lyrics that remind me that whatever happens with the M.E., I am still me: \u201cThe higher you build your barriers, the taller I become. The further you push my rights away, the faster I will run. You can deny me, you can decide to turn your face away, but there's something inside so strong. I know that I can make it, though you're doing me wrong, so wrong. You thought that my pride was gone; oh no! There's something inside so strong.\u201d ",
