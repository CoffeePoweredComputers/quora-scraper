            "answer_text": "Carole was a main female voice of the more serious singer-songwriter side of popular music. I\u2019m sorry if this answer is a little disorganized but my thoughts about this are complicated. The main reason for that is Carole already had had a big career as a songwriter, and that dramatically affected the album and its success. First, Tapestry came out at the right time. James Taylor\u2019s huge hit with Fire & Rain the year before exposed a large audience existed for popular music that didnt sound poppy. Note: Sugar Sugar by the non-group The Archies may have been the top selling song of 1969. (And also note: the Monkees turned down one of the most successful songs of all time because it was too commercial. Keep that in mind.) How big was the vogue? Again, James Taylor took Carole\u2019s song You\u2019ve Got A Friend to his first #1 in I think the same year, 1971. Think about that: James recorded the same song Carole has on her own record. The song really is that good. As for other examples, think Laura Nyro: similar tonality in voice, wrote hits like Wedding Bell Blues (for the 5th Dimension), Eli\u2019s Comin\u2019 (3 Dog Night), And When I Die (for BST) in the years immediately preceding Tapestry. She recorded her own material but it was as a songwriter that she\u2019s best remembered. And of course there was Aretha. Who first sang Carole and Gerry Goffin\u2019s You Make Me Feel Like A Natural Woman, back in 1967. So Carole could see a pathway she could go down, and as a songwriter in that era it was relatively normal for her to record her own material. Second, Carole took some of her best for herself. And some great stuff by Goffin/King & Stern/King (notably both Where You Lead, which became the theme for Gilmore Girls and It\u2019s Too Late). As a top songwriter in the business, she knew a good song. This was not a case where the artist had to be persuaded to sing a song with commercial potential or maybe just convinced of the merits of a song. Carole had lived that for years. She and Gerry wrote Pleasant Valley Sunday. They go back to Little Eva and the Loco-Motion and Herman\u2019s Hermits doing I\u2019m Into Something Good. She\u2019d already had a massive career before she started doing her own music. So, there were antecedents, including Carole\u2019s own work. And there was a vibe that the marketplace was buying softer music that had the energy of rock music without the noise and which wasnt syrupy or, bluntly, dumb as Sugar, Sugar\u2019s lyrics. And she nailed it. She totally nailed it. That record was so good that it quickly became one of those \u2018if you dont like Tapestry, there\u2019s something wrong with you\u2019 records. Even back in those relatively unenlightened days, men dug the idea of women\u2019s sexuality in I Feel The Earth Move. The biggest male chauvinist of that era had to respect Tapestry. And the appeal to women was unreal. Carole unlocked women\u2019s souls. ",

Did it influence other artists in that genre? bala Ramakrishnan (bR)\u2019s Answer: This was one of the first albums I bought in my life (after buying all the albums by The Beatles). (NOTE: I came to the United States in 1971). \u201cTapestry\u201d is filled with absolutely wonderful songs. Here is one for you to listen to as you continue reading\u2026  Carole King - It's Too Late (Audio) This From Wikipedia\u2026 The album was critically well-received; Village Voice critic Robert Christgau felt that her voice, free of \"technical decorum\", would liberate female singers; while Jon Landau in Rolling Stone felt that King was one of the most creative pop music figures and had created an album of \"surpassing personal-intimacy and musical accomplishment\". Along with being selected Album of the Year, it also received Grammys for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, Record of the Year (\"It's Too Late\"), and Song of the Year (\"You've Got a Friend\"), making King the first solo female artist to win the Grammy Award for Record of the Year, and the first woman to win the Grammy Award for Song of the Year. The album remained on the Billboard charts for 313 weeks (second only to Pink Floyd's 724 weeks with The Dark Side of the Moon). ",

            "answer_text": "I will try to be as brief as possible. 1) great melodic songs. 2) No complicated dressing up with arrangements . In fact as a musician and writer my first reaction was that theLP was rather like a demo, even though it required no other thing in order to improve it. 3)It was all about the songs . Carole had split with her husband who wrote lyrics with her and she was sort of forced to perform the new songs which were more personal and mature. Consequently, there existed a ready made collection of songs which tasteful singers jumped upon, to be done as in days gone by, in different ways.Nothing I have said is meant in any way, to lessen the excellent performances on these recordings !So Intentionally or by circumstance,Carole came up with something that cried out for dissemination of the material by others. In other words it was the complete opposite of a pop record that was an end in itself. Tapestry was a wonderful thing and a jumping off point for inspired others.Since then,it had not inspired anyone to attempt to mimic Carole. It is the song not the singer. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe the timeless themes of love, hope, frustration and the like are what makes albums like \u2018Tapestry\u2019 such enduring and influential recordings. When songwriters are enduring personal tragedy or disappointments in life or career, these can translate into amazing testaments, musically speaking. Take \u2018Rumours\u2019 by Fleetwood Mac, which was written under extreme emotional duress between the band members, as an example. It\u2019s popular longevity in the Billboard Top 200 albums for many years shows that it connected with it\u2019s audience in a big way. Previous to that, \u2018Tapestry\u2019 had held that record. Variety of song styles and mood on \u2018Tapestry\u2019 makes it a huge influence on many musicians. However, all of these timeless themes mean nothing unless the music can hook you and/or move you. That, is the crux of the biscuit. ",

Her influence opened the door for many artists. ",
