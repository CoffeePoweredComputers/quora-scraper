            "answer_text": "What do you say to someone who claims that he (let\u2019s say) doesn\u2019t like the Beatles? Well, if he happens to be a Roman, you might say this, in a conciliatory spirit: De gustibus non disputandum est. Why do you doubt his sincerity? Don\u2019t you know that people show individual differences? Speaking of individual differences with respect to music, I enjoy art music very much: Monteverdi, Vivaldi, Corelli, Bach, Telemann, Handel, Mozart, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Dvorak, Stravinsky, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Debussy, Ravel, Sibelius, Grieg, Carl Nielsen, and so on and on. Unusually for someone who can say that, however, I\u2019m not much on Beethoven. I like spinach, but you don\u2019t. That is because one thing happens in my brain when I have spinach, and something quite different happens in yours when you have spinach. Similarly for the Beatles (though in fact I do like their music). That\u2019s the way the world works. To return to the Latin, I understand it to mean this: Tastes are not to be disputed. But that isn\u2019t entirely true. At the risk of running up against the anti-elitist spirit of the age, there is indeed most definitely such a thing as higher and lower tastes\u2014which suggests interesting philosophical questions\u2014and I suppose that to some extent the former can be taught and learned. That effort, however, is more appropriate to Bach than to the Beatles. ",

            "answer_text": "This happened, sort of, at a party. A person said they liked Disco much more than anything from the 60\u2019s. So, I set up a little contest with them. They got to have all disco bands. I got to choose one band from the 60\u2019s. I further narrowed my side to one member of one band. A crowd started to form as I said I would go first, naming a song and then, they could name a song. I said, and I\u2019ll tell you when I\u2019ve won and if these people agree with me, then we\u2019re done here. If they disagree, you win. I\u2019ll choose The Beatles, and take Paul. I\u2019ll go first. \u2018Yesterday\u2019\u201d They went next and chose \u201cStaying Alive\u201d. I chose \u201cBack In The U.S.S.R.\u201d They chose the Stone\u2019s song\u2026 what was that? something about some Puerto Rican girls that are just dyin\u2019 to meet cha. Anyway, it went on for about five picks and they said, \u201cDisco Duck.\u201d I was waiting for it. I said in about a nano-second. \u201cI win.\u201d Everyone agreed. If you can\u2019t get past five songs before you name \u201cDisco Duck\u201d as a great song, you\u2019re bankrupt\u2026 game\u2019s over\u2026 down goes Frazier\u2026 Thanks for playing\u2026 I\u2019m sure I had about 50 songs left in the bank, maybe 100. You can say you don\u2019t like the Beatles if you want. It makes about as much sense to say you don\u2019t like Bach. ",
