            "answer_text": "Pros: 1. It promotes gender sensitization.You can get to know the opposite sex better,it also promotes a healthy relationship between boys and girls living in the same campus. 2. It acts as an stimuli for overall personality development. As far as real life is concerned there are no demarcations based on sex(you work in the same office,dine at the same place and so on).So staying with members of the opposite sex prepares you to get accustomed to a heterogeneous atmosphere. 3.Boys will become cleaner. In ways more than one.Obviously. :p 4. It reduces the monotony that sometimes invades hostel life.Interacting with members of the opposite sex is  provides different avenues of fun.For eg-  Hostel LAN is down?No gaming or surfing.I'd hardly imagine boys getting together for a game of \"truth and dare\" We prefer something with more gore. :P Now if it were a co-ed I can see the same group of boys nicely joining in with girls for a fun session of the same game. Thus coed reduces the blandness and single dimensional character that plagues most hostel environs.  Cons: Population boom! Just kidding-I'm sure todays' youth are conscious enough to use protection.Joking again!No need to get all worked up. :p  On a serious note,the cons: 1. It is difficult to ascertain if the hostel residents(especially young hormone-driven college students) are mentally prepared to control their behavior and urges. It's the PRIMARY reason why coed hostels are almost non-existent. 2.Invasion of privacy.Coed hostels will eventually lead to problems arising due to invasion of personal space and privacy of the opposite sex. 3. It requires extremely mature and calculated behaviour on both parts,which is difficult to expect out of most college undergrads,to prevent awkward or unpleasant situations. ",
