            "answer_text": "The entire library of Black Sabbath, musically, is intermediate level and some of it could be played reasonably well by a beginner. Fans of Black Sabbath may balk at this, but most of Sabbath\u2019s capital comes from being innovators or the seminal \u201cHeavy Metal\u201d band and not from any sort of technical skill or fantastic songwriting ability. They have a few catchy riffs that can be learned fairly easily. Black Sabbath had a dark sound that wasn\u2019t really based on blues and sex like say Free or Led Zeppelin was, but on a gritty machine-like punctuation and doom. It was different when it came out but it wasn\u2019t challenging to produce. Don\u2019t get it confused with Ozzy Osbourne\u2019s later solo albums, which usually feature a guitar virtuoso. The lead parts on those albums would take someone who has notable skill to play properly. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll call Black Sabbath Paranoid \u201ceasy intermediate\u201d. Rhythm part is mostly simple power chord shapes and it doesn\u2019t move around the neck much. Solo isn\u2019t that hard either. BTW, a zillion years ago, I actually performed \u201cParanoid\u201d live in front of an audience several times with my garage/rock cover band. Once at a bar gig, once at a talent show, once at a frat party. I played rhythm, the solo (or my approximation thereof), AND sang lead vocals. . .and I only had about two years total guitar playing experience then! That probably tells you all you need to know about difficulty here. And I agree 100% with P Duffy, below. Entire Black Sabbath catalog is relatively easy to play being mostly power chords and stock pentatonic scale stuff. This was sort of \u201cmust learn\u201d stuff for aspiring rock guitarists of the 70s, kind of the way Nirvana was when I started in the early 90s. ",
