            "answer_text": "George Harrison while a great guitarist showed a lack of exploring his abilities as a guitarist and he never really reached his full potential. His solos and riffs were always short and simple. That isn\u2019t a bad thing, it was all a part of his charm. He was one of those guys who knew when to play and when not to and he never over did it. Page in my opinion belongs in the top 3 guitarists of all time. He's had amazing and mind blowing solos like the ones on Stairway To Heaven, Heartbreaker, Whole Lotta Love. And he was probably the king of riffs, e.g.; Kashmir, Black Dog, Achilles Last Stand. But unfortunately, Page was always a sloppy guitarist live. He played with Clapton and Beck somewhere at the ARMS concert in the 1983 and absolutely flopped while the other two stole the show. He had his stupid Chopins\u2019 prelude covers which even die hard Led Zeppelin fans. And ofcourse no one can forget the Led Zeppelin reunion at Live Aid. That was probably their worst concert ever. All of them were sloppy, not playing in time, not in rythm and it was just awful. Basically, after Led Zeppelin, he didn't do anything worth listening to and maybe that was because he had already made it. But during his years of glory he was a beast and that alone would earn him a spot in the top 3. Clapton in my opinion was far more advanced than both of them. Page was a great guitarist. Harrison was a great song-writer. And Clapton was both. Clapton is probably one of the only guitarists in the world who could go from something like the face melting solo that is widely considered one of the best guitar songs of all time on Crossroads when he was with Cream to writing something as beautiful and heart wrenching as Wondeful Tonight and Tears In Heaven. From Layla to Steppin Out to Little Wing to I Shot The Sheriff, Hideaway, Sunshine Of Your Love, White Room to River Of Tears. Clapton was the only one who was able to cover SO many genres. He did psychedelic rock, blues, blues rock, hard rock, soft rock, ballads, pop, jazz, acoustic, reggae and any other genre you could think of. Page never explored anything other than blues rock and hard rock. For me, Layla and Crossroads were his absolutely masterpieces on the guitar. Just listen to the original Layla with Derek and the Dominos and the version of Crossroads he recorded with Cream in 1968 and you'll know what I'm talking about. Clapton was in so many different and equally influential to the musical world bands like Cream, Derek and the Dominos, The Yardbirds, John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers, Blind Faith.. In addition to the points I raised, Clapton was easily the most influential of the three to the guitar world. Heck, he even influenced Led Zeppelin when was in Cream. Page\u2019s legendary guitar set up of a Gibson Les Paul through a Marshall amp was created by Clapton himself. Clapton was the first person to have that set up when he was with John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers in 1966 and after that EVERYONE followed. (This isn't an opinion btw he actually did create the set up, you can verify this online.) Bands and guitarists influenced or inspired in part by Cream and/or Eric Clapton alone stretch far and wide and they include but are not limited to: Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Jeff Beck Group, Eddie Van Halen, Ed Sheeran, Dire Straits, Mark Knopfler, Duane Allman, Joe Bonamassa, Van Halen, Ozzy Osbourne, AC/DC, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest , The Police, Joe Satriana, Joe Walsh, Van Halen, The Eagles, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Queen, Guns n Roses, Slash, Aerosmith, The Allman Brothers, Steve Winwood, Kiss, Deep Purple, Ritchie Blackmore, Santana, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Scorpions, etc.. And these are just the most prominent ones to be influence by Cream or Clapton. If you require citations for the abovementioned bands and musicians stating their influences, you can individually search it. There's also a ton of people who influenced Clapton who say he's the best like B.B. King, Freddie King, Chuck Berry, Buddy Guy. Guns n Roses have played Layla live several times as a tribute to Clapton. Jimi Hendrix told his manager he would come to Britain only on the condition that he got to meet Clapton. After they met, they became instant friends and went to clubs together, you can see pictures of them together online. Clapton even bought Jimi a left-handed Strat to gift him. Hendrix would also shout out to Clapton while he was on stage as a sign of friendship. Hendrix often performed covers of Sunshine Of You Love live and said he was performing it was a tribute to Clapton. Duane Allman said he was in absolute awe of Clapton when he first saw him and was absolutely star struck upon meeting him. They later went on to become great friends and they described eachother as the \u201cmusical brothers they always wished they had\u201d because of their instantaneous simultaneous inspiration they got from listening to each other play and from playing together. Allman played with Clapton on the Layla album and they often spent whole nights talking and playing together. Bonamassa said that three albums that inspired him to pick up the guitar and that were his biggest influence were: John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton (the Beano album), Rory Gallagher's Irish Tour and Goodbye by Cream. Out of those three, two are Clapton's albums. Reference for this is the Influence section of Joes wikipedia page : Joe Bonamassa - Wikipedia Eddie Van Halen has said that Clapton is the *only guitarist* that ever influenced him staying; :Eric Clapton is basically the only guitar player who influenced me \u2013 even though I don't sound like him. There was a basic simplicity to his playing, his style, his vibe and his sound. He took a Gibson guitar and plugged it into a Marshall, and that was it. The basics. The blues. His solos were melodic and memorable \u2013 and that's what guitar solos should be, part of the song. I could hum them to you. What I really liked was Cream's live recordings, because you could hear the three guys playing. If you listen to \"I'm So Glad,\" on Goodbye, you really hear the three guys go \u2013 and Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker were a couple of jazz guys, pushing Clapton forward. I once read that Clapton said, \"I didn't know what the hell I was doing.\" He was just trying to keep up with the other two guys! After Cream, he changed. When he started doing \"I Shot the Sheriff\" and this and that, and when he hooked up with Delaney and Bonnie, his whole style changed. Or at least his sound. He focused more on singing than playing. I respect him for everything he's done and is still doing \u2013 but what inspired me, what made me pick up a guitar, was his early stuff. I could play some of those solos now \u2013 they're permanently imprinted in my brain. That blues-based sound is still the core of modern rock guitar.\" The source of the above can be seen here : 100 Greatest Guitarists I gave the example of Ed Sheeran just to show how diverse and far reaching his influence is. Here Ed says why Layla influenced him to play : Ed Sheeran: The Music That Made Me ",

            "answer_text": "Jimmy Page, hands down. Before he ever played with the Yardbirds, Jimmy\u2019s skills as a guitarist earned him a reputation as being perhaps the most sought-after session musician of all time. E.g., Jimmy supported bands such as the Who, the Beatles (George Harrison\u2019s band), the Rolling Stones, Van Morrison, the Mammas & the Pappas, just to name a few. The only guitarist, alive or dead, who\u2019s generally worthy enough to be compared to Jimmy Page as the all-time greatest guitarist, is Jimi Hendrix. Eric Clapton is phenomenal & has appeared with Jimmy Page\u2014& on separate occasions with Jeff Beck\u2014on stage for dueling solos; however, he lacks some of the finger agility that Page demonstrates having. I love the Beatles & loved George Harrison\u2019s music. His playing skills are beyond those of most guitarists. Questions similar to this one are often answered from an emotional frame of mind, with die-hard fans of a particular guitarist believing he or she is the best. In many cases, the one judging mentions sloppiness or a lack thereof. The truth is that no artist ever plays a piece without walking away thinking they could have done something better. In rock & roll, especially, many skilled guitarists often performed while tripping, high, or even drunk, & routinely played with little-to-no sleep. Does this mean they are not skilled guitarists? If a very smart \u201cyou\u201d takes a simple math test when you\u2019re high & don\u2019t do that well, does that mean you are not intellectually smart? When answering a question such as this one, listen to studio recordings for the truth, as well as public information about the individual. E.g., I\u2019ve never heard anyone comment about Led Zeppelin\u2019s John Paul Jones competency, yet this dude was leading a college orchestra at age 16! Besides playing several instruments, JPJ\u2019s education & documented experience are perhaps comparable only to Boston\u2019s Tom Scholz who held both a BS & MS in Mechanical Engineering from MIT, & used his expertise to develop sophisticated playing techniques that make Boston\u2019s debut album one of the most professionally engineered albums of all time.

Although, to be honest, I feel the question is ultimately pointless - both Clapton and Page are masters at what they do, but what they do is so different that any comparison is futile. Nevertheless, since the question was asked, my answer is Jimmy Page. If there is one omnipresent and equally infuriating misconception about Page\u2019s playing it\u2019s that he was a \u2018sloppy\u2019 player. What a load of bollocks! Those incredible bursts of notes that cascade over each other seemingly on the verge of losing control don\u2019t just happen, and they sure as hell don\u2019t just happen because someone\u2019s playing is sloppy. Every note Page plays is played on purpose and under his total control. The Heartbreaker solo sounds the way it does because the song demands it\u2026and that is the real key to understanding just how brilliant Page really is. Page\u2019s style is unique in that, of all the guitar players I\u2019ve ever heard, his playing arises the most organically from within the overall song. Listen to a selection of solos by your favorite guitar slingers - over time the differences in the solos will start to fade and what you\u2019ll start to hear are the similarities. Virtually every guitarist on the planet plays and structures their solos according to the chords he\u2019s soloing over. Break down their solos and you\u2019ll see the same thing over and over again\u2026rhythm goes from A to D and the solo hits A\u2019s and D\u2019s\u2026and so on. These guys are essentially viewing their solos as tiny little boxes built of chord tones; their task is to play something interesting that touches on each of those chord tones at the right moment. Now listen to a Jimmy Page solo. There\u2019s a melodic, flowing quality mostly lacking in other players. The solo arises from the melodic nature of the song and always remains entirely a part of the song. David Gilmour has a similar but much more limited approach; the only other guitarist that I\u2019ve ever heard come remotely close to Page\u2019s mastery of organic soloing is Slash on Appetite for Destruction. Unfortunately Slash had one albums worth of licks before falling back on cliches, Page knocked out 9 brilliant studio albums full of utterly original and compelling solos. Now, to compare him to Clapton is really pointless. Clapton is and always will be a dedicated bluesman. His brilliance lies in the way he has mastered the blues better than almost anybody else. His phrasing is perfect, his vibrato is legendary. Listening to Clapton is basically getting a PhD in the blues. Page is a brilliant blues player, but he isn\u2019t satisfied staying strictly within those confines. Page\u2019s playing is the first and best hybridization of so many different forms (blues, celtic, folk, country, eastern) into what we recognize today as \u2018rock guitar\u2019. Listen to Cream in 1968 and Clapton\u2019s licks, while played louder and faster than ever before, are pure pentatonic blues. Now listen to Led Zeppelin 1. Yes there\u2019s a lot of pentatonic blues in there, but it\u2019s mixed up with scales and modes that nobody else would have thought to use and presented in a way that nobody else had ever imagined. In the span of a year and a bit Jimmy Page more or less invented hard rock guitar - that is pretty damned impressive. So my answer is Page, bearing in mind that someone could make an equally viable case for Clapton. These are two very different players, trying to do two very different things. ",

            "answer_text": "They are all wonderful guitarists in their own individual ways. And all three had very different ways of working. George was never overstated, but always tasteful, on point and always perfect. He spent a lot of time on each song developing his guitar lines, just only for that song. When he went in to record, he had all of his lead guitar parts completely worked out, down to the smallest nuance. For George, it was always all about the song. Nothing more, nothing less. But, having worked so hard on his parts, they sometimes seemed to lack spontaneity. And spontaneity is so very important. Why? Because, that\u2019s where the \u201cMagic\u201d is. The feeling of hanging on by your teeth and surviving. Clapton was a true groundbreaker. His sound and style during the reign of Cream was unlike anything else before it. His early sweet signature \u201cWoman Tone\u201d was iconic. He inspired so many guitarists, there\u2019s no possible way to count them all. His improvisations live were awe inspiring. And the melding of his playing with that of Duane Allman on \u201cLayla\u201d by Derek And The Dominoes was a \u201cdouble threat\u201d of very, very excellent guitar work. But his return to his Blues roots and his focus on singing, just left me cold. I get it. I respect it. But it just didn\u2019t grab me by the cojones like Cream or Derek And The Dominoes. I missed the old Eric. Page\u2019s playing on the other hand was always riveting. Sure he tended to be a bit sloppy, especially live, but even sloppy, his playing had amazing power. But he also played faster than Harrison or Clapton. At the speeds he played, even a robot couldn\u2019t avoid some sloppiness. In the studio, he\u2019d record two to four different leads off the top of his head and only keep the one that \u201cgrabbed\u201d him. Every lead solo was a roller coaster ride where you could feel his emotion. You were on that roller coaster along with him, praying for your life. Excitement! So overall, I have to go with Page. He had a stronger vision. He wrote, played, recorded and produced\u2026 And did all of those tasks amazingly quickly. Any other guitarist under Page\u2019s normal time constraints, especially early on, would have totally floundered\u2026 Badly! And Page\u2019s entire volume of work still sounds fresh and new even today. To top it all off, Led Zeppelin albums had a much better sound from a production standpoint. How much of that was Page and how much was Andy Johns or Eddie Kramer? I honestly don\u2019t know. But what I do know is that Led Zeppelin\u2019s music is timeless. and their \u201cchemistry\u2019 was truly magical. ",

            "answer_text": "That's a very tricky question. You really have to break that down by genre I believe because George Harrison was unparalleled at being the Beatles lead guitar player he would play phrases and quips and clips of things that no one else could have even thought of that makes those songs what they are he was a genius and extremely talented on the fretboard so for my answer as far as a songwriter goes I'd have to say George Harrison. Jimmy Page on the other hand stole almost everything that made them famous there's very few Led Zeppelin songs that are actually Pain by Led Zeppelin In fact there are several YouTube videos they the best ones start with Led Zeppelin plagiarism and there's at least two of them that are 10 minutes long and different it show the original black blues and other people that they stole from and didn't even give credit to my personal favorite Zeppelin song is Boogie with Stu and it's nothing more than Ritchie Valens Oh My Head and Jimmy Page had the nerve to say that plant leaned on the vocals pretty heavy lean on the vocals he stole them word for word but I digress. When Zeppelin was doing what they did best Jimmy Page couldn't be touched however live I don't think it was a very good player was definitely a student musician and that's what he started out as but he had some really classic licks that are really hard to cop so as far as raw Edge in the studio I'd have to say Jimmy Page was a genius in that department. Eric Clapton is clearly the winner of your question just outright. Eric Clapton Change the face of guitar England and the English standpoint clearly hello America beat that with Jimi Hendrix that's not the question Eric Clapton was apart of so many influential groups the new Yardbirds Derek and the Dominos Blind Faith cream and his own solo career unparalleled appeals to so many people and let's face it he's a Van Halen zero so I'd have to say based on your question Clapton would clearly be the rating champ of this question with the examples that I've given taken into consideration that's my humble opinion and I've been a guitar player for 40 years ",

I think technical ability \u2014 that is, the ability to consistently and cleanly play a note \u2014 Clapton is probably the best of the bunch. But he really is just a straight up blues player. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that but we\u2019re comparing him to two guys who were far more experimental in almost every way. Always staying so close to home has lose a point. The Beatles started off as a standard rhythm & blues band, but even on that first album, their playing is very solid. By the end of the decade they were experimenting a lot, with psychedelic sounds and Near and Far East rhythms and tonalities. The Beatle\u2019s \u201cTomorrow Never Knows\u201d sounds as fresh 30-odd years later as The Chemical Brothers\u2019 \u201cLet Forever Be.\u201d But are The Beatles really Harrison\u2019s show? He was a great composer and had a lot of tasty guitar bits, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s in that first tier of players. That leaves Page. Unlike Harrison and The Beatles, Zeppelin was his show. He and Peter Grant put the band together initially as The New Yardbirds. He\u2019d already been an accomplished studio musician and lead for The Yardbirds. Though made up mostly of old blues standards and other copied tracks, Zeppelin I somehow sounds revelatory. Rolling Stones\u2019 List of the Top 500 albums of all times places \u201cLed Zeppelin I\u201d at 29 and \u201cPlease Please Me\u201d at only 39. Compare the frenetic playing on a track like Heartbreaker - a beautiful sloppy mess of a solo - and the staid blues playing on \u201cSince I\u2019ve Been Loving You\u201d or \u201cI Can\u2019t Quite You Baby.\u201d Listen to all that goes on in a track like \u201cGoing to California\u201d or \u201cThe Rain Song.\u201d Page is the king of the 2-note bend. Play with a bow? Check. Play with a theremin? Check. Sure, Page was sloppy. And he plagiarized a lot, which you could argue shows the breadth of the talent. But ultimately not a lot of guitarists commanded the Power, the Mystery, and the Hammer of the Gods. Page was the best of the three.

            "answer_text": "Daniel Auger (from Elvis Story), who lives in Quebec city, Canada is the better guitar player. He is a mixture of perfect clean note playing, like Eric Clapton, but with a Harrison-like sense of melody creation. Solos like a God and plays rhythm with the best of them. Finger-picks too. But you never heard of him and never will. He doesn't speak English all too well and he is a family guy who likes being close to his family more than being on the road. Just goes to say that there are total diamonds out there that will never be internationally known. Best guitarist I have ever heard. Now back to the question at hand. George Harrison knew how to create his own melody lines within a melody and give a song what it needed. For many of the Beatles songs, if you removed the melody his guitar plays then the song would just not be as great. Day Tripper comes to mind \u2014 a so-so song made memorable by the notes Harrison chose to play as a guitarist. Could Clapton or Page have done as much with Day Tripper and all those other Beatles songs? I truly doubt it. On the other hand Harrison could never ever have rocked Led Zeppelin like Page did. But what do you mean by better? More proficient? There are a hell of a lot more proficient guitar players than Harrison but few and far between as melodically creative. And isn't that is what music is about? Just my two cents guys but I have never appreciated Clapton overall as a guitar player \u2014- though sure I do appreciate his songwriting talent. Didn't really like Led Zeppelin much either but man could Page choose the right notes for his style of music. Total perfection! On the other hand, Clapton knocked it out of the park, father than Harrison could have, for Harrison\u2019s song My Guitar Gently Weeps but then again it was more of a Clapton genre of song. So my vote goes to Harrison because of his ability to beautifully play in more genres of music than either Clapton or Page \u2014 at least from what I have heard by these last two. ",

            "answer_text": "I am not commenting on songwriting because it is totally subjective and depends on one's preferences or tastes, but rather only focusing on technique since it is slightly more absolute in nature.  Throughout the years, Eric Clapton is the better guitar player compared to the other two in terms of technique and chops. Certainly, Clapton had his bad moments, but otherwise throughout his career he always delivers when it comes to playing the right notes with the right feel and touch. His bends are rarely out of tune, while his signature finger vibrato is always consistent, still in control even in his most fiery mode. Up until this day, Slowhand never loses his chops and is still the improvisation machine that he is well-known for, although his playing has mellowed a bit, which is totally understandable for someone of his age.  Jimmy Page, on the other hand, seems to get sloppier than his prime (even then he was not necessarily the cleanest guitar player ever). While his musical ideas are timeless and fantastic, he was not the best in terms of technique. At the same time, although George Harrison continued to get better in his overall guitar technique throughout his career with The Beatles as well as in his solo work, such as showcased on his slide guitar technique in My Sweet Lord and the great guitar lines he played in the Abbey Road album (e.g. Octopus' Garden, Something, Here Comes The Sun and The End), it was never his main forte, which was why he fell short to Clapton in my opinion.

All three of them had outstanding \u201chistory\u201d of their respective and established performance venues. Eric probably had more different venues of performances through the years (his rendition of \u201cMoon River\u201d with Jeff Beck). Jimmy had \u201cno fear\u201d when it came to blues and solo efforts in any of his performances. George focused on one group but never stopped learning and experiencing alternative framework for music as well as added instrumental activity and, moreover, utilizing that knowledge in other recordings and compositions of his own. Had George experienced the same \u201crebirth\u201d from group to group (like Eric and Jimmy), then maybe there could have been a broader \u201ciconic\u201d value to his endeavors. But he was not into that and why would he be? Eric and Jimmy made statements in music and gained excessive (and worth) notoriety from such efforts. In all, I have to say, all three had made significant statements in music and cultural influence, but in different character (each one of them). In all three, they all were \u201cshowmen\u201d ( to most, the very essence of determination of \u201cthe better musician\u201d although that has nothing to do with the question). All three were versatile. All three had excellent \u201cfeel\u201d for music and excelled in their respective fields. What one has to recognize is\u2026. How many could switch gears to take on jazz, folk, other idioms and applications of music that we were not familiar with seeing them play? I that case, I would answer that more versatile the performer, the more popular. That does not mean that if they all took on the same pathway of versatility, they would not have been equal in every aspect. ",

Page is loose and often messy. Clapton is always right in the middle of his zone of complete control, whereas Page is often on the edge. George Harrison is not really the same kind of guitarist at all. He was a key member of the greatest band of them all, but no one looks at The Beatles and says \u2018their guitar solos changed the world\u2019. I would argue that Jimi Hendrix was the greatest rock guitarist, and Page was the second greatest. But I would probably agree that Clapton was actually a better guitar player, taking all things together. ",

Having any one of these folks would be wonderful, no doubt, but as a band member I would want Harrison. Clapton would be my second choice, then Page. Some answers have pointed to each of these players\u2019 \u201ccareer arc\u201d. It\u2019s a great point. Personally, I feel as a guitar player, Harrison\u2019s solo work, even late in his life was some of his best playing. Clapton and Page both peaked much more forcefully and powerfully, but years and years ago. Clapton\u2019s solo career playing, while certainly impressive, was downright mellow, by design, after Mayall/Cream/Blind Faith/Derek and he continued to change his styles with the times. He never really got it back in my mind. Page seems to me all over the musical map after the first 4/5 LZ records. To me his work, while excellently executed per usual, lost focus for where to go after those earlier peaks. Just my opinion folks, I love all three, but give me George in my band. ",

I would say that both Page and Harrison have a more sophisticated understanding of music in general, but neither has the clean chops to compete with Eric Clapton. In studio recordings, Jimmy Page has laid down some killer solos, but he is often a bit of a disaster live. If you were to throw Jeff Beck into the mix, as people often do, then he easily surpasses all three, and they all know it. He\u2019s nearly as clean as Clapton, even while taking risks, as tasteful as Harrison, and more musically sophisticated than Page. Even on an average night, Jeff Beck would blow all three of them off the stage playing live. ",

Even Jimi Hendrix, as amazing and gifted as he was, could only play in his style and he couldn\u2019t make the exact same sounds as Jimmy Page or Frank Zappa or Jeff Beck any more than they could sound like Hendrix. Like a writer or a chef, guitar playing is a skill that each player is always developing and improving while adding their own style and nuances.

This is a subjective question. It\u2019s not like who is the best quarterback in football\u2026 For these 3 it\u2019s an unfair comparison as clapton and page were blues purists where as harrison was more pop rock so, although all three were accomplished guitarists, depending on what style of music you like you\u2019ll make a decision based on who you enjoyed listening to most. For myself? I\u2019m a big fan of early british blues rock so it comes down to clapton and page, no disrespect to harrison who i thought was a very good guitarist, and for me it was Page, hands down. Frankly in terms of talent and creativity Jeff beck blows them all away. ",

George did what he did, both as a Beatle and a prolific songwriter \u2026 noting some of his slide playing. (*) To that end, Paul Kossof, David Gilmour and Jeff Beck \u2026Carlos Santana\u2026. ",
