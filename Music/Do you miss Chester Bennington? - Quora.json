            "answer_text": "Yes, I do. I miss Chester Bennington almost every day since he died, last July. Not as much as I would if I had known him personally, not even as much as some of his fans. But still enough to feel sadder and less hopeful than I used to when he was alive. Here are the main reasons why: He was one of my favorite musicians. Linkin Park has been one of my favorite bands for nearly a decade (I also really like Chester\u2019s side project, Dead By Sunrise). I went to a Linkin Park show when I was eighteen and I fell in love. It was the first time I felt the power, the magic, of singing at the top of your lungs, along with tens of thousands of people, including the artists, the songs I usually listened to alone, on my MP3 player. And the band was great, especially Chester and Mike, they really connected with us, in the audience. I felt like I belonged, like I never had felt before, and wished that show would never end. I had been listening regularly to the band for almost a year at that point, but that was the night I became a true Linkin Park fan. After that show, there were a lot of unhappy days and sleepless nights where I\u2019d confort myself by remembering that night. I got to see them live for a second time a few years later. This time I was on the front row. I got to see both Chester and Mike (and Hahn, before the show, handing out CD copies of their newest single Wastelands) performing right in front of me a few times. After the last song, Chester went to greet the audience and I got to hold his hand for a second. Now, Chester\u2019s gone. I\u2019ll never be able to see him live again, to sing along with him, hold his hand, meet him in person. Even smaller things, like see him release new songs, new albuns, new music videos or live performances. He\u2019ll never tweet again, post pictures on Instagram, go live on Facebook or show up on BTS videos - usually goofying around with his band mates, especially Mike.  I had hoped, like I do with all my music heroes, to be able to grow old with Chester and the rest of Linkin Park. To see them release albums and play live and to attend as many of their shows as possible, until we were all grey and old. Depresssion and suicide took that future away. One of my favorite bands will never be the same again.There\u2019s no point in pretending otherwise.  Take a look at the concert on Hollywood Bowl. The band was in great shape, don\u2019t get me wrong. I was particularly happy to see Mike still being Mike, even after everything. However, while I could feel Chester\u2019s spirit among them, he was still missing. The guest singers were fine, but none of them fit with the rest of Linkin Park the way Chester did. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll ever find someone who will. So that\u2019s another thing to mourn. That said, I still think Linkin Park should go on as a band. Chester may be gone, but Mike, Phoenix and the others aren\u2019t. They\u2019re still Linkin Park and I think they still have a lot to give. I\u2019d prefer if they went on as a five-piece, with the ocasional guest singer. It\u2019s their decision, though. He was a great human beingBy now everybody knows what Chester went through, since he was a kid: parents\u2019 divorce, sexual abuse, drugs and alcohol addiction. A few months prior to his death, he said his own mind was not a good place and, in a way, he was his own worst enemy.  After having to survive all this crap, Chester could\u2019ve become a bitter, misanthropic person. He could\u2019ve pushed everyone away and isolated himself, in an attempt to get even with the world. Some of us would probably do that for a lot less. Chester was nothing like that. He was kind, cheerful, he used to bring so much joy to everyone. He was the funniest man ever. He was a good husband and a good father, according to his wife, Talinda. To sum up, Chester was a good person when it\u2019d probably be easier for him not to be. It was hopeful, inspiring, to know it was possible to go through hell and still have a relatively happy life, with a family, friends and a band. Not to mention his music, into which he channeled his dark side, helping millions of us dealing with our own crap. But it didn\u2019t last. The darkness inside him won. He\u2019s gone and we\u2019re stuck in a world full of shitty people. To say it\u2019s not fair is an understatement.  Maybe this is all just me. I\u2019m very emotional when it comes to music. For me, it\u2019s a source of inspiration, of confort, it\u2019s a way of bonding with other people all over the world. Maybe I get too attached - to the music and to its creators. All this said, I\u2019m grateful for having had Chester Bennigton in m life, even if just for a short period of time. He may have left us too soon, but he touched the lives of millions around the world. Maybe one of these days I\u2019ll come to terms with his departure, but I will always love hind and I\u2019ll never forget him. ",

            "answer_text": "Linkin Park was the first English band of almost every kid born in India during the 90s. It was our gateway to English music. There are SO many, SO many people in India who are die-hard Linkin Park fans. Even those who barely listened to music knew Linkin Park. It was like Michael Jordan was to basketball, like David Beckham was to football. Linkin Park being your favorite band was so mainstream that people made fun of it. I might have been 12 or 13 when I first heard Numb. I had every single Hybrid Theory, Reanimation, Meteora and Collision Course song in the 8th grade on my iPod. I knew every word of every song, including the remixed Reanimation songs. After Minutes to Midnight came out, I had a filtered Linkin Park playlist that only had 42 songs that I really loved (that playlist now has 70 songs). Bands don't usually go to India on their tours. They don't stand to make the money that they make here because the currency isn't as strong and the tickets end up being too expensive for people to afford them. Chester and Mike promised they'd do their best to tour India on multiple occasions but I guess it didn't make financial sense for them to do so. I came to the United States two years ago. And during the fall of 2017 they were supposed to perform in New York\u2019s Citi Field. I thought about how watching Linkin Park live would be the best night of my life. Every day I listened to my playlist. I watched videos of them on tour. I looked at the setlists of their performances. I couldn't wait to see the band I loved in the flesh for the first time. When Chester passed, I couldn't make sense of it all. It was so far from anything I expected that I could not process it at all. I had emotionally invested myself in Linkin Park so much over the course of my teenage years that this felt like a lie. A big hoax. It couldn't be true. Luckily I had friends who felt the same way and I didn't feel alone. I had people who understood how I felt. But a couple of days later, it dawned on me that I wouldn't ever get to watch them play. I felt abandoned by Chester. It's selfish to think about missing out on seeing him perform when he was gone but the idea of never getting to see them perform destroyed my already broken heart. I started feeling guilty whenever I did something else and it slipped my mind. I felt like I wasn't mourning him enough. I listened to Linkin Park every day, all the time. I still do. I couldn\u2019t get myself motivated to do the things I was supposed to do. I wasn\u2019t excited to do anything. Anything happy would make me feel guilty. I watched full length concerts loudly in my room and had my own mini concerts. I have consumed every article, every video, every song related to Chester and Linkin Park possible over the past 10 days. Initially, the songs haunted me. I\u2019d listen to the lyrics and almost feel like I was listening to musical suicide notes. But that was just the nature of the songs. Chester maybe gone but there is so much of Chester that is still alive every day. He is alive in his songs and I for sure will be listening to Linkin Park and in my own way, keeping him alive, at least until the end of my days. ",

When i turned 14 , my friend suggested me to listen to linkin park\u2019s \u201cin the end\u201d and i was like , i haven\u2019t even heard of linkin park ; who the fuck are they? I listened to it. And i liked it. My elder brother, who apparently knew linkin park from a long time was listening to \u201cnumb\u201d and i was hooked. Guess what? Now i am a fan. A big one. For me , a dream of seeing Chester live was broken , even before it became a dream. A day hasn\u2019t been when i have not cried for him. Only thing that keeps me alive is , his music and the legacy he has left behind.Thinking he is now in a better place, away from pain, might help you feel better. And yes , i miss him all the time. Remember , there was , and shall always remain only one \u201cChester\u201d known to this mankind because there is no one even 0.00000001% close to what he was. (i am crying even now). Chester , if you are listening, if you died thinking that no one loves you , you were wrong. We all love you. Millions and Millions of people love and will always love you. Rest in Paradise , champ <3 Once your fan , Forever your fan. <3 ",

For me he was and he will be the best vocalist of all time. I miss Chester Bennington so much that at some points of my life I feel like breaking down and never function again. Chester saved so many people through his music and it is a shame that we could not do the same for him. Chester Bennington left a hole so deep in my heart that sometimes I just refuse to believe the fact that he is not there anymore. Sometimes I feel so hollow and sad. I have never felt like this for any celebrity before. Chester Bennington left a wound so deep that it will never heal again. We miss you Chester. ",
