            "answer_text": "Singing softly should not, but if you are doing a breathy style, i.e. whispering, then you are not fully connecting the cords and blowing air past them, which can dry them out over time. Keep hydrated and use a disconnected, breathy voice on a limited basis. If it hurts, you should get checked out by a doctor to confirm if there is anything wrong physically, and look into getting a singing teacher to evaluate your vocal technique, which can affect your vocal health long term.

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re trying to sing with a soft, breathy sound, that means that a lot of loose air is flying past your vocal cords, causing a pain in the throat. The vocal cords should remain adducted while they produce the note. The key to singing quietly is to use a normal amount of air, and controlling the resonance to get the sound you\u2019re looking for. you can also use vocal fry to get a slight rasp, though don\u2019t overdo it.
