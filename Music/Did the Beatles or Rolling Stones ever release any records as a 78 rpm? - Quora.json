            "answer_text": " Beatles 78 issued in Columbia Beatles 78s were not commercially released in the U.K.* 1962 was only just past the 78rpm era in the UK, 45rpm singles overtook 78s saleswise in 1957 and still had considerable UK sales until 1959. There were Elvis Presley and Ray Charles titles released in the UK in 1960 but not in the U.S. where the uptake on 45s was slightly ahead of the UK. But in India, 78s were still produced until around 1965 and several Beatles and (l believe) Stones titles produced. Parlophone pressed about 30 different Beatles tracks as 78s in India including the following; Parlophone ONLY:\u00a0    DPE 167        If I Fell / And I Love Her\u00a0    R 5200         I Feel Fine / She's a Woman\u00a0    DPE 172        Tell Me Why / I'll Cry Instead\u00a0    DPE 180        I'll Follow the Sun / Words of Love\u00a0    R 5305         Help! / I'm Down\u00a0    R 5389         We Can Work it Out / Day Tripper\u00a0    DPE 187        Michelle / You Won't See Me\u00a078s could be played on wind-up gramophones that didn't need electricity. Some of the latest released in India were \u201cIf I Fell\u201d (Parlophone DPE 167), \u201cTell Me Why\u201d (DPE 172), \u201cI\u2019ll Follow The Sun\u201d (DPE 180) and \u201cMichelle\u201d (DPE 187) and date from summer 1965, these are possibly rarer than the earlier releases. South Africa is another country often quoted with regard to Beatles 78s, there are 78 test pressings but I'm not so sured if there regular releases. There were several 78 releases from the Philippines and a handful from Columbia & Argentina. The excellent link below for 45worlds - Communities for collectors, critics and the curious logs many of the Beatles 78s and is the source for much of the above. See link below. The record industry was not as regulated in 1962 as it would become, so semi official Beatles and Stones 78s probaly exist in other countries (South East Asia?). Rolling Stones 78s were released in Mexico by Peerless Records as noted in the excellent history of the company on the Arhoolie link below.   (*) An Emidisc 78rpm acetate of Devil in her heart/All l Got to Do exists. As does a BBC 78 reference disc and others Super-Rare Beatles 78 Up For Auction - uDiscover # The pre Beatles Quarrymen release and it's Paul McCartney repressing were on 78rpm.

            "answer_text": "Great info below\u2026.did not know the 78 lasted this long in certain countries. I do recall Warner Bros experimenting with 78 in the early 70s with a Randy Newman release\u2026they claimed the higher revolution speed, like increased tape speed, produced better quality sound. Bottom line though: who wants 6 78rpm singles over a 12 cut LP that sounds fine anyway? Same with Quad. When you have a budget of $200 to buy speakers, why buy 4 $50 speakers when you can have better quality with 2 $100 speakers? ",
