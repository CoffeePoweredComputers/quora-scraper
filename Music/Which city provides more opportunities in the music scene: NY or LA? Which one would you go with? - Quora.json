            "answer_text": "I'm in a good position to answer this having lived and worked in both places as a musician. I currently live in NYC. It really comes down to which aspect of the industry in which you plan to work. I'm in NYC because most of my work revolves around Broadway and live theatre. Though there's a theatre scene in LA, it's not nearly as vibrant as NYC. However, LA tends to offer more in the way of Film and TV related work, whether it's composing, orchestrating, playing, etc. Not that such work doesn't exist in NYC, but it's just more limited. Also, LA seems to be a better place to network to break into the pop music scene. Again, this exists in NYC, but most of the major acts and labels are in LA. NYC is fantastic for the concert/classical scene and that aspect is incredibly vibrant. Though LA tends to have much less of this type of work, the LA Phil and LA Opera are some of the finest in the world. The other factor is lifestyle. You should consider which city offers the type of setting that will allow you to function at your best and be your happiest. ",
