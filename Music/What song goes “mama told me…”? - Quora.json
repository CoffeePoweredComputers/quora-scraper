            "answer_text": " What song goes \u201cmama told me\u2026\u201d? A good number of songs over different decades contain these words. I remember them from a song in the 1970s. A young man is telling how he felt about a party he attended.  This was written by Randy Newman, the nephew of Academy Award-winning composer Lionel Newman. The song is about a party that left a \"bad taste\" in the writer's mouth. The drug scene was fairly new to American middle-class youth at that time.Randy Newman explained in a 2017 interview with Rolling Stone: \"It's a guy going to a party, and he's a little scared. The first line (\"Will you have whiskey with your water or sugar with your tea\") was a vague connection to acid. I don't remember being thrown off by that stuff then. If I was that unsophisticated - which is possible - I wouldn't admit it.\"\u201cAnd that cigarette you're smoking 'Bout to scare me half to death\u201d is really self-explanatory, isn\u2019t it? I remember I was invited to go to my first concert in St. Louis, MO. to see Ted Nugent and the Amboy Dukes. I had no idea what to expect as I had never heard of the group and had never been to a rock concert before. So Ms. Prim and Proper Teacher filed into this auditorium, the light went down and everyone lit up! All I could think was, \u201cIf any of my students are here and see me, I am so fired! The Great Wagaboo* will fly me from the flagpole in the circle drive!! Talk about that cigarette you\u2019re smoking and me being scared to death! Then the curtains opened and out came this guy in, well, a loincloth.  What songs did I hear? Don\u2019t ask me! I was too busy politely avoiding all the lit joints being offered me from the front, back, both sides, somehow up between my knees, and I swear one was dropped in my hair. After an eternity of fending off funny cigs, sugar cubes, pills, and who knows what else, the concert was over. The lights went off \u2014 about 30 seconds passed \u2014 and the ceiling lights came on. EEEEEEEKKKK!  A solid line of blue was across the stage! I just knew I was going to be in the hoosegow that night and out of a job on Monday.  After that, I swore I would go only to concerts with stick-in-the-mud, small-town, Prim-and-Proper folk like me \u2014 if any existed!

            "answer_text": "One of my favorite bands, Three Dog Night! Just how phenomenally popular was Three Dog Night? I find it amazing that their first four albums were released in the span of just 18 months, and yielded 10 Top 40 hits.  At the time of their popularity, I had 3 dogs and my last name was \u201cKnight,\u201d so some friends who knew popular music called me, \u201cThree Dog Knight.\u201d And because I was a huge fan, I thought it was a great nickname! Three Dog Knight, and I loved it. Since the group\u2019s singers all had good lead voices, they switched lead singers from song to song. Following are their fantastic chart toppers: OneTry A Little TendernessEasy To Be HardEli\u2019s ComingCelebrateMama Told Me (Not To Come)Out In The CountryOne Man BandJoy To The WorldLiarAn Old Fashioned Love SongNever Been To SpainThe Family Of ManBlack And WhitePieces Of AprilShambalaLet Me Serenade YouThe Show Must Go OnSure As I\u2019m Sittin\u2019 HerePlay Something Sweet (Brickyard Blues)\u2018Til The World Ends Three Dog Night \u2013 defined \u201cpop anthem\u201d and made Three Dog Night one of the world\u2019s most popular bands. Still today those recordings have endured the fickleness of pop, waves of \u201970s nostalgia and the test of time. Here\u2019s my absolute favorite by Three Dog Night.  1969\u2019s \u201cTry A Little Tenderness\u201d was the first, reaching #29. The second, the Nilsson-penned \u201cOne,\u201d went to #5 and was the group\u2019s first gold (sales of 1,000,000 copies pre-1976). A cover of the musical Hair\u2019s \u201cEasy To Be Hard\u201d reached #4; Nyro\u2019s \u201cEli\u2019s Coming\u201d #10, and the infectious \u201cCelebrate\u201d #15. In 1970, Three Dog Night scored its first #1 with its gold rendition of Randy Newman\u2019s \u201cMama Told Me (Not To Come).\u201d \u201cOut In The Country,\u201d co-written by Williams, peaked at #15. After \u201cOne Man Band\u201d hit #19, 1971 opened with \u201cJoy To The World\u201d (written by Axton), a gold single that stayed #1 for six weeks, became the group\u2019s signature song and whose opening line \u201cJeremiah was a bullfrog\u201d remains a \u201970s touchstone. The #7 \u201cLiar\u201d followed. Also that year, the gold \u201cAn Old Fashioned Love Song,\u201d written by Williams, was a pop #4 and, from Axton, \u201cNever Been To Spain\u201d a #5. Williams also co-wrote the #12 \u201cThe Family Of Man\u201d which charted early the next year. Heard too in 1972 were the gold \u201cBlack And White\u201d (#1) as well as \u201cPieces Of April\u201d (#19), which introduced then-unknown songwriter, Dave Loggins. Two more singles went gold: \u201cShambala\u201d (#3, 1973) and \u201cThe Show Must Go On\u201d (#4, co-written by Leo Sayer, 1974). The remaining Top 40s are \u201cLet Me Serenade You\u201d (#17), Hiatt\u2019s \u201cSure As I\u2019m Sittin\u2019 Here\u201d (#16), Allen Toussaint\u2019s \u201cPlay Something Sweet (Brickyard Blues)\u201d (#33) and the group\u2019s final charter, 1975\u2019s Loggins-penned, \u201cTil The World Ends\u201d (#32). Here\u2019s a Concert performed in 1972.  Three Dog Night disbanded in 1977. Today, Negron, is a solo artist, and Three Dog Night, with Danny Hutton and original bandmate Michael Allsup continue to record and perform for fans who have never forgotten the joy they brought to the world of music. In case you love the band as much as I do, I\u2019m posting a few more videos. I can\u2019t help it!          BIO \u2014 Three Dog Night You\u2019re probably thinking that I\u2019m a tiny bit obsessed with Three Dog Knight. And if you are thinking that, you\u2019ve got that right\u203c\ufe0f I\u2764\ufe0f3 \ud83d\udc36\ud83d\udc36\ud83d\udc36 \u2026..  __________________________________________________ Sorry to leave on a sad note, but I saw this article for the first time today.
