Some people are just haters. And for what it\u2019s worth, in my opinion, God loves sincere worship more than \u201ccorrect\u201d worship. I don\u2019t think God is pleased if we don\u2019t try to know the truth of His character, but I DO think He is not a harsh critic who is nit-picking our praise songs to Him for accuracy. Psalm 51:17 says \u201cThe sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.\u201d It is INEVITABLE that you will err in your understanding of God and in your biblical accuracy. We cannot see God as He is. We are constantly finding out that we have believed God to be one way when, in reality, He is not that way. How much of the time do we find out that our operational ideas about God are incomplete or false? And yet God still allows us to worship Him and does not despise us for our mistakes. If you love these songs and they inspire true worship of God in you, sing em. Trust that God will direct you into truth and correct you as He feels is needed. It takes a lifetime to figure out God and we can\u2019t wait until we\u2019re right about EVERYTHING to praise what we do know about Him at the time anyway! off my soapbox ",

            "answer_text": "For the most part, you can sign a song as you give praises to God almighty. The bible even talks about skilled musicians, or people with skill to play instruments, paraphrased. The thing about hillsong is certain things that they may be promoting that is not good, nor of God, but we all fall into that category. Everyone one of us will do something God does not like, so based on that we can't judge. We can however judge righteously, if you are doing good in a particular area you can help others get out of that place by your own experience. The dont judge me verse is misquoted by many people without reading the rest of it. Matthew 7:1-2 [1]Judge not, that ye be not judged. [2]For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. And it continues the following verses as well. You may sing hill songs if they are about God and glory to God and how much love Jesus has etc etc. The songs about self should be questioned if there are any, I myself enjoy a couple songs from these people, and I dont have a clue what they preach or what they do. Just like the hymnals, where did our hymns come from, and if we research Hillsong people, then research the hymnals creators, all of them. You'll find out that the people who wrote these songs are not perfect either. As for myself, anyone reading, I encourage you to check out this guy I've been listening to, he does a wonderful job. Best part of all, he is a sinner like the rest of us who is in need of a saviour. Simon Khorolskiy He does Russian and English. ",
