            "answer_text": "That would depend on what you see as highly intelligent. I don't believe in superior intelligence however I do understand what you probably mean by highly intelligent - highly functioning mentally particularly in areas such as maths, science, verbal reasoning etc. Am I right? Well I'll go ahead anyway. Basically with emotional attachment to concepts one has been taught (something we all have been through) comes cognitive biases. A person initially may have been 'fully\u2019 functional with no biases, a state most people are only in when a very very young child for whatever reason. Later down the line however, a person starts to develop habits based on what they have been taught. For instance with religious people there is often the unwillingness to consider what they believe might be wrong despite the fact they are always ready to tell another person that. This unwillingness to challenge one's own beliefs is an effect that I can only describe as forgetting more as you go along. The person was open to believing this theory at first but once they did believe it it took on a life of its own along with its very own perspective. As one gives theirself away to theories they knew no better than to accept these theories become the truth as far as the owner is concerned because to go back on these beliefs is to hurt part of oneself. With concepts acting as entities in the mind of the beholder no more knowledge is allowed to enter except that which confirms these beliefs. A person proficient in areas such as maths in science will probably have deeply embedded belief systems like I described but these particular areas are highly lacking in emotion. They are the exact opposite to creativity. They look for concrete evidence and fact to determine what is right and wrong and so to prioritise mathematics and science in the mind leaves no gateway for any emotions to enter. No one yet has been fully taken over by concepts yet but I do not look forward to the day it comes. I have even correlated conceptual thinking and lack of emotion to being left brained for what that term is worth these days. Think about it; if you start from a place of creativity then the concepts are always just concepts. If you start from a concept there's no other way than destruction. Unfortunately conceptual thinkers do not know that's how they're thinking. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A request. How did you formulate the idea that high IQ persons are lacking in empathy? I am truly curious to know. Do you watch the Big Bang Theory which exaggerates a high IQ individual (Sheldon Cooper) as someone with diminished social skills, including empathy? Empathy is a personality trait- one of dozens of such traits. I would expect to see modest, positive correlations between measures of empathy and intelligence for a number of reasons. There really aren\u2019t too many academic studies on this topic, although the ones that I could find on google scholar (NOT my go-to source of scholarship BTW), are supportive of my contention that there\u2019s a positive correlation between the two. HOWEVER, here is evidence from The Giving Pledge (Home - The Giving Pledge). For those readers who are not familiar with The Giving Pledge, here\u2019s a little background. It was started in 2010 by Melinda and Bill Gates. In order to be a member of this club, you need to meet the following criteria: you are a billionaire;you pledge to give away 50 percent of your wealth upon death to a charitable cause!As of this year, there are 174 such pledges from 22 countries around the globe. There are some names of pledges that you might recognize in addition to the Gates: Paul Allan (co-founder of Microsoft)Michael Bloomberg (former mayor of NY and owner of Bloomberg News)Sir Richard Branson & wife, Joan (Virgin Air, Virgin Records, Virgin Phones, etc.)Warren Buffet (investor par excellence and founder of Berkshire-Hathaway)Elon Musk (Tesla automobile, SpaceX for starters)Mark Zuckerberg and wife, Priscilla ChanYou must agree that these people are among the high IQ set\u2026 So, from this perspective, there are a number of high IQ people with great empathy (not to mention all of the therapists around the globe).
