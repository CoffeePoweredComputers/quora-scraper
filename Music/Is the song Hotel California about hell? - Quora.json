            "answer_text": "\u2026the Eagles themselves describing the song as their \"interpretation of the high life in Los Angeles. In the 2013 documentary History of the Eagles, Henley said that the song was about \"a journey from innocence to experience... that's all...\" To me, the song reminds me about an old parable spoken of in the Bible, called the Prodigal son. And to me, its as if the prodigal son were in modern day and the story picks up after he leaves his father\u2019s house and he is riding on a motor cycle\u2026 Here is those scriptures: Then He said: \u201cA certain man had two sons. And the younger of them said to his father, \u2018Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me.\u2019 So he divided to them his livelihood. And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together, journeyed to a far country, [fired up his motorcycle and hit the highway\u2026] *Cue: Hotel California\u2026 and there wasted his possessions with prodigal living. But when he had spent all, there arose a severe famine in that land, and he began to be in want. Then he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he would gladly have filled his stomach with the pods that the swine ate, and no one gave him anything. \u201cBut when he came to himself, he said, \u2018How many of my father\u2019s hired servants have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!\u201d - Luke 15:11 ",

            "answer_text": "I don't think it primarily is about hell. I believe that Frey and Henley very cleverly wrote some haunting lyrics for the amazing guitar opening that came to Don Felder through inspiration and a lot of picking. I've wondered often if the lyrics \u201cYou can check out any time you like, but you can never leave\u201d are in any way making reference to the play No Exit, Huis Clos, by Jean Paul Sartre. That play is about some people who are trapped in a hellish place. ",
