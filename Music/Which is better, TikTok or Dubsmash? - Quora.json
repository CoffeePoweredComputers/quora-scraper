            "answer_text": "Tiktok will be the winner  Lip-synchronizing application Dubsmash was near the very edge of death. After a concise snapshot of virality in 2015 close by Vine (R.I.P), Dubsmash was draining clients quicker than it could enroll them. The application let you pick a sound track like a rap tune or film statement and shoot a video of you claiming to state the words. In any case, there was no place in the application to post the recordings. It was a creation instrument like Hipstamatic, not a system like Instagram. There's an explanation we're just utilizing one of those today.  Both apps serves the same core feature. Both of them video making app where you can lipsync on audio. Dubsmash covers only a small area (Lipsync) and Tiktok covers so many categories like dance, Acting, Skill videos. ",
