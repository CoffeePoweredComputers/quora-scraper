            "answer_text": "Sadly auto tune is used on their albums, but probably for some pith correction in different spots. They have had a hand in writing some of their songs, and I believe Nick wrote a song or two possibly more. I am a BEE GEE\u2019S fan from about 6 years of age, that\u2019s 44 years of listening to their music. I personally don\u2019t think the Jonas brothers [as good as they are] get anywhere near their level. ",
