            "answer_text": "10 Best Free Music Apps for Android 1. Deezer Deezer has been around for a while and it\u2019s one of the better free music apps. The free version of the service lets you use Deezer\u2019s FLOW feature to discover new artists and you can listen to playlists and mixes based on your personal taste. It also has lyric fetching, unlimited playlist creation, and mixes based on individual artists. There is a premium version that gives you more features like higher quality audio, offline listening, and Android Auto support if you want that. The only caveat is that the application seems to be a little rough around the edges. 2. Google Play Music Google Play Music is an increasingly popular option. Its hallmark feature is the ability to upload 50,000 of your own songs for personal streaming. Of the free music apps on this list, this is the best option if you want to combine your current collection with an online service. The free version of Play Music lets you stream your music and listen to various curated playlists. The paid version comes with more perks, but the free version isn't half bad. The service also now includes podcasts for both free and paid users. 3. iHeartRadio iHeartRadio is one of the most popular free music apps out there. It\u2019s a radio app where you can listen to a variety of stations based on your individual tastes and it also comes with seasonal radio stations and things like podcasts, talk radio, and comedy shows. It also includes AM and FM radio stations that support data streaming and you can even listen to news and sports. It\u2019s a versatile application with a modern, Material Design UI and it comes with the little stuff like Chromecast support, Android Wear support, and Android Auto support. 4. Jango Radio Jango Radio is kind of a wildcard in the free music apps space. It has a variety of music from both big names and independent artists alike. Unlike most, this service allows independent artists to pay for plays, meaning that you may hears a song that an artist paid to hear. This gives Jango its operating revenue which helps it stay free. There are some potential ethical issues. However, there aren't any ads on the service and it's a good way to discover some new stuff. 5. Pandora Pandora Radio is another one of the most popular free music apps. It\u2019s key feature is its simplicity and cross-platform support. You can easily jump right in and listen to music you enjoy on virtually any platform you can think of and your stations sync across all of them. Their content library has grown a lot over the last few years. The experience overall is extremely positive. They also have a full, on-demand streaming service for those who want a Spotify style experience without leaving Pandora. The free stuff still works fine, though. 6. Slacker Radio Slacker Radio is another popular option, although it doesn\u2019t get talked about as much as some other free music apps do. It boasts both free and subscription services that include music, shows, comedy, sports, and all kinds of other content for you to enjoy. Much like Pandora, it has strong cross-platform support and you can choose between creating your own radio stations for quick, easily listening or curated playlists created by Slacker. There is also a $3.99/month plan to remove ads and give you unlimited skips and a second $9.99/month plan to give you on-demand listening and offline playback. 7. SoundCloud SoundCloud is one of the more unique free music apps because it doesn\u2019t just focus on what\u2019s popular right now. In fact, literally any artist can upload to SoundCloud and that content can be played back by anyone. The service currently boasts 125 million tracks which is more than anyone will ever listen to, ever. It also has a variety of shows, podcasts, and other content to enjoy. The free version is mostly independent artists with the paid version getting you the more popular music by bigger names. Most people who use this for free music are looking for those indie artists anyway so it's a good option. 8. Spotify Spotify has been just great for music streaming and it\u2019s among the most popular free music apps ever. It boasts a generous library, curated stations and playlists, and the ability to create your own stations and playlists if you so choose. The free version of the service isn\u2019t as robust as the paid version, but there are still plenty of things to like about Spotify\u2019s free service. The app also comes with some light Material Design, Chromecast support, and the tablet version actually has more features than the mobile version. 9. TuneIn Radio It\u2019s true that TuneIn Radio is more known for its talk radio, podcast, and comedy radio offerings than it is for its music, but there are still plenty of ways to enjoy free music on TuneIn. It boasts over 100,000 stations in total that covers almost every genre that you can possibly think of and that also includes AM and FM radio stations that can be streamed over data. There isn\u2019t much of a reason to get the premium version for music alone, but it does also offer audiobooks, live sports broadcasting, and more. 10. Youtube YouTube is probably the world's most popular free music app. You can find virtually anything you've ever heard of. Every band ever has a presence on YouTube. You can also find official music videos, live shows, and even local bands from time to time. You can also make playlists, get recommendations, and a lot more. People can also kill two bird with one stone if you do happened to get YouTube Red because that also comes with a Google Play Music subscription. Even without money, though, this is the free music app worth trying. YouTube may get its own music streaming service sometime in 2018. We'll let you know if that happens.

            "answer_text": " Hola @Benny Chow ! The best offline music app, that I would recommend is \"Musixmatch\". This seems best to me in the sense, you can see the lyrics while you are listening to the song, and each line will be highlighted on time. The other preferred language will show up too as sub-language under the English language. You also can enjoy the lyrics with a pop up head even if you are using any other musical app or doing any other works on your phone. After saving a lyrics for once connecting the internet, you can enjoy it when you are offline. There are also many more fascinating options like the picture of the singer or band will show up as background, you can add up the lyrics and earn badges, you can copy some lines from the lyrics and put it on your favorite card and post on social media.  So now enjoy listening to Music with Musixmatch (though recently it has appeared with a new UI design that I'm not liking compared to the previous one). ",
