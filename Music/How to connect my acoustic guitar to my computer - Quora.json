            "answer_text": "As per Kenneth\u2019s answer, you\u2019ll want a USB recording interface, and either a 1/4\u2033 cable (for a pickup-equipped guitar) or a microphone and XLR cable (for a non-pickup-equipped guitar). Next, you\u2019ll need a DAW of some kind to record into - no, Audacity won\u2019t cut it. REAPER and Tracktion Waveform are inexpensive DAWs that you might actually like. Alternatively, there are the heavyweights like Ableton, Cubase, Reason, Pro Tools, and the Mac-exclusive Logic Pro. The heavyweights usually have a cheaper license for people who only need certain features (e.g. if you\u2019re going to record 1 guitar, 1 voice, 1 kick pedal, then you can get away with Ableton Lite which allows only 4 tracks). Next, recording technique. Once you\u2019ve set your tempo and metronome to play along to, you\u2019ll want to set your input volume. On a pickup-equipped guitar, it\u2019s as simple as Max your guitar output volume, set tone controls to neutralPlay the hardest you would during the songSet your interface input gain such that your DAW is showing -6 ~ -0dBFS during peaksDo a trial run-through, then re-adjust input gainIf you\u2019re using a mic, then you\u2019ll also have to fiddle with mic placement. Congratulations, you\u2019re ready to record your song! ",

            "answer_text": "This question doesn\u2019t include a lot of context, so we\u2019re all having to make some assumptions in our answers. If you just want to record something quick without high fidelity, you can probably use the built-in microphone in your computer (assuming it has one). For example, every Macbook has a built-in microphone, and every Macbook comes with Garageband. For Windows there is a free \u201cSound Recorder\u201d app you can download. If you are trying to make a *good* recording, it gets a bit more complicated. To make a good recording of an acoustic guitar, you should use a microphone in a quiet room, and record into a USB interface. Or get something like an Apogee MiC, which is a good microphone that plugs right into a USB port. You can, of course, get a pickup put into your acoustic guitar, and plug that directly into a USB audio interface. But the sound you\u2019ll get will not include the lovely harmonics of your acoustic. I would only recommend doing so if you\u2019re going to use some kind of computer amp emulator. But your question is pretty basic so I doubt you\u2019re going to do that. ",

            "answer_text": "The best way, in your case, would probably be an acoustic pickup. You can plug this directly into your computer, but you will probably need an 1/4\u2033 to 1/8\u2033 or 1/4\u2033 to USB adapter for this. Audacity is just fine for now. You aren't going to be running a professional rig yet, and you've got to learn somehow. I\u2019ve also heard great recordings on Audacity. I personally prefer to use Ardour as a free DAW. It\u2019s plenty powerful and comes with ample pre- and post-mixing options. At some point, you\u2019ll want to buy a Scarlet 2i2, which is a great beginner-level Digital Audio Interface (DAI). I\u2019m telling you to go with 2i2 because it comes with 2 channels in and 2 channels out. Some guitarists plug directly into the DAI and have one extra microphone sitting in front of the guitar to get that more natural sound. Some use one microphone. A Scarlet DAI is good because it can take 1/4\u2033 and XLR inputs. The Scarlet also comes with a free version of ProTools and Ableton Live, which is plenty for learning on. ",

As a fun note, if you have a relatively recent smartphone, you can actually use its built-in microphone and, while I wouldn\u2019t use the method for a commercial record, for demos or other purposes the results aren\u2019t too shabby at all :) ",

If your guitar has a pickup, you then just need an instrument cable which you can plug into the interface and you\u2019re up and ready to go. If your guitar doesn\u2019t have a pickup, you\u2019ll need a microphone and a mic cable to go into the interface. ",
