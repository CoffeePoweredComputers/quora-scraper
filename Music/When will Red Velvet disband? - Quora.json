            "answer_text": "Right? I mean, I\u2019m sorry but if a group whose alleged greatness is shoved in your face incessantly by the Pop Music industry and obsessive fans alike, it\u2019s only a matter of time before great, massive negative reactions begin. Next thing you know, they\u2019re thrust off the cliffs of our collective memories, forced to plummet straight into the canyons of disbandment. Irene is nearly 45 years old, Seulgi is drinking lake water in Slovenia, Wendy is now mute from her fall accident - unable to speak or run, Joy is a full-time model and Yeri is rumoured to replace Ellen DeGeneres as the host of \u2018The Ellen DeGeneres Show\u2019 (since \u2018Yeri-han Bang\u2019 is such a success), so they obviously no longer have much in common, no time to record music together and the \u201cLuviebond\u201d isn\u2019t real. SM is also known to often disband their groups\u2026 Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think Red Velvet are a decent K-pop girl group (even though I rarely listen to them). They may be regarded as the \u201cNation\u2019s Girl Group\u201d, \u201cNation\u2019s Pride\u201d, \u201cLiving Legends in the K-pop hall of fame\u201d, \u201cCulturally important artists\u201d, \u201cK-pop\u2019s most musically interesting girl group\u201d, \u201cThe Standard-Bearers of K-pop girl group conceptual versatility\u201d and more\u2026 but I barely believe they\u2019ve done a whole lot to warrant these statuses despite this foot-long resume which I simply don\u2019t think necessarily means longevity or they have what it takes to last that long in such a competitive and saturated industry. They also have a few decent hits here and there with steady output, but I wouldn\u2019t call them \u201cLegends\u201d. ALSO: I don\u2019t see how they\u2019re any better than Twice or Blackpink? IN FACT, to people who actually don\u2019t like or are otherwise indifferent to them (totally not us), the fanfare that surrounds their critically-acclaimed and culturally important discography seems like some ridiculous messianic cult if you ask me. That\u2019s probably why they\u2019ll disband in the next 24 hours KST since the contrarianism is so rife. That\u2019s right friends, Red Velvet is going to disband in the next 24 hours - give or take - and I for one, like many, will be waiting to feel \ud835\ude8d\u0336\ud835\ude92\u0336\ud835\ude9c\u0336\ud835\ude8a\u0336\ud835\ude99\u0336\ud835\ude99\u0336\ud835\ude98\u0336\ud835\ude92\u0336\ud835\ude97\u0336\ud835\ude9d\u0336\ud835\ude8e\u0336\ud835\ude8d\u0336 commiseration at the inevitable but long-overdue tragedy.

SM is known for keeping their groups with no upcoming comebacks as such, so disbanding officially won't be done. With the recent events for Wendy, she is healing and Joy has even said that they were preparing for a comeback soon. I saw another comment that said Wendy was mute because of the accident but it is incorrect comsidering SM Station's \u201cThe Milkyway\u201d come back has happened. We can see that she still loves to sing. It's just walking and demanding activities like dancing that is a bit hard for her right now. Like Heechul of Super Junior, although he suffered through a horrible accident and injury, he is still singing and appearing in Super Junior comebacks. Irene may leave the group at some point, but she could, or the group would just be like the Milky Way comeback where they just sit and sing, with no extra choreograph. But we could never know, this is just a hope of one of Red Velvet's fans.  (Accidentally wrote this as a comment somewhere else\ud83d\ude05) ",

They also have the some of the best chemistry and bond in an SM group next to Shinee. They are like a family and will never break. Wendy is just injured and we are inactive. They were at their 3rd prime success and talent wise in Psycho, I don\u2019t think they would disband ever. Out of the big girl groups, they will last one of the longest. Their music sound and genre is also ever-changing and diverse. A subunit was released and it made world records for subunits. Red Velvet produces stable and plentiful money for SM. Please be patient and think positive, there\u2019s many more years to come.  ",

But I think Irene might be absent because by then she's 39 years old and she would definitely be married by then. SM groups are very long lasting. Like tvxq even though there are only 2 of them now but they are still very famous especially in Japan and a lot of idols respect them. BoA, TVXQ, Super Junior, SNSD, SHINee, F (x) are the perfect example of long lasting SM groups/artists. While in YG, 2NE1 had disbanded. In JYP, Wonder Girls had disbanded. I truly hope they last very long. ",

If they renew their contract near their disbandment date, (if they agree) the group will continue to perform. However, as of now, SM has no intention of disbanding Red Velvet. ",

They simply just focus more on individual activities,but as SM's group grows older they seldom promote as a group but they are group. Well let's take an example,SNSD,now they don't promote as a group,they focus on solos and acting and anything specific to individual member but they are still SNSD. Hope it helps :) ",
