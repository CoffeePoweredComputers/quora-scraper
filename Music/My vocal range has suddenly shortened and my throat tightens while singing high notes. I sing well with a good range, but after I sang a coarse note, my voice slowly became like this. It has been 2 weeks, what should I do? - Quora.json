            "answer_text": "I think it's a temporary problem.Start gurgling with lukewarm salty water. Practise Kharaj ( lower notes) early in the morning most preferably between 4am to 6am . Don't be nervous because with this you will shortly regain your original pitch.These days avoid talking much and also talk on a low pitch if needed . If the vocal problem continues for more than 20 days after kharaj riyaz and gurgling,then consult an ENT doctor. ",
