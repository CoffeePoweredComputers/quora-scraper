The melody that he hums is used as a pre-chorus (cleverly, I might add) for all of the requests, as a way of saying \u201cmy job here is to play the songs that let you reminisce. Whatever they are, if I know them, I\u2019ll play them\u201d. He says, \"Son, can you play me a memoryI'm not really sure how it goesBut it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it completeWhen I wore a younger man's clothes.\" As was pointed out in a comment, it could be fun to think about what that song might be\u2026 \u201cPiano Man\u201d was written in the early 70s. If an older man is asking, it could be a song from the 40s or earlier. He may have been a veteran of WW2, and a \u201cyounger man\u2019s clothes\u201d could mean a service uniform. He might be thinking about a song/memory tying him to brothers-in-arms both here and gone, and a memory may be a song they all might have heard during war time that gave them comfort, therefore sad but sweet. What could fit such a request? Perhaps \u201cI\u2019ll be Seeing You\u201d as performed by Billie Holliday.  ",

            "answer_text": "In my personal and humble opinion, Piano Man is one of the top 10 songs to come out of the Rock and Roll era of the 20th century. Each line is a metaphor reflecting on where someone is in their life, where they have been, what they are doing and where they are going. Personally I think this is one of the best lines in the song. He says, \"Son, can you play me a memoryI'm not really sure how it goesBut it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it completeWhen I wore a younger man's clothes.\" This is a metaphor for remembering ones youth. There is no actual song referenced here. The La, La, La, Di, Di, Da part is just of the melody Billy Joel wrote for the song. The part that really gives me the chills is at the end when Billy Joel brings it full circle and the people ask him \"Man, what are you doin' here?\" Makes you stop for a second and think about what you are doing right now and why.
