            "answer_text": "I would have to concede that Ed was probably top 10 Rock guitarist of all time and probably top 3 most influential rock guitarist of all time (which on my list would Chuck Berry, Hendrix, EVH or maybe Jimi Page ) and You wouldn\u2019t even include Chuck Berry if you didn\u2019t concede that he paved the way for all this future creativity. He made it possible. Hendrix also -very innovative but such a short body of work. Page created such a huge body of work that also paved the way for what would become possible and mainstream when it comes to hard rock composition. If you expand that list to include other genres of music, Eddie is probably top 25\u201330 overall . There are MANY MANY Jazz, Blues and country guitarists who are technically way more proficient than Eddie. You may hate country music but if you go watch the likes of Chet Atkins, Glen Campbell, Roy Clark - those guys could play -not just twangy country crap but very structured solos all over the neck and equally as fast. Eddie was really good at being Eddie but if you\u2019ve ever seen him in a jam session with other guitarists. He often looks a little off step. He\u2019s comfortable with his style and playing over stuff that he writes but he doesn\u2019t hear everything the same and can be difficult for him to switch styles. If you listen to the blues jams he did with Bryan May - they\u2019re not all that impressive . As a Pure blues player - he\u2019s not Really that good. when he tried to step in and play Sounds of Silence with Paul Simon - he kinda stunk it up too. There\u2019s lot of example of that which kinda hurts his overall ranking because so many others can play any style to a degree Within their own interpretation (on key and with thoughtful meaningful solo progression). Ed\u2019s advantages are \u201cinnovation and influence\u201d. He truly innovated the tone of electric guitar. He took tapping to a completely different level and made it mainstream. He used natural and pinched harmonics to a way that had never been done. Mastered the Floyd Rose tremolo and incorporated so amazingly into a style of play. He Modified amps and guitars technically to alter them to get tone that literally set the bar for 80\u2019s rock music. He created a decade of \u201clook alikes and play-alikes\u201d in the 80\u2019s which grew to be a bit nauseous but imitation is the sincerest form of flattery I guess. He authored a damn nice Custom line of guitars and amps that are used by throngs of professionals as well as amateurs even today. All of that considered, Eddie really deserves a seat right at the top for \u201cInnovative and Influential\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t put a number on him. He is one of may favorites but his playing was not without flaws or limits. He deserves credit for taking a unique approach to the instrument including tapping. Unfortunately for his legacy, tapping triads is pretty easy and so this aspect of his playing was easily copied by his peers and successors. By the end of the 1980\u2019s most hair metal bands had a guitar player who was trying to emulate Eddie, which obscured just how special his playing could be. Consider for a minute Jimmy Page playing the theremin. He\u2019s using it to create a specific soundscape that no other instrument could create. Now imagine if every guitar band of the 70\u2019s started playing the theremin but without Page\u2019s ear. They would each make Page\u2019s experiment seem like a cheap trick. (You could probably say the same for The Beatles and the sitar.)  What the copycats overlooked was Van Halen\u2019s phrasing, timing, rhythm, and his ear. They could all copy tapping \u2014 no one copied Cathedral. And boy did EVH have a gift. Here he is just riffing, seamlessly switching between Mean Streets and his Jeff Beck impression. Imagine sounding this good on a goof and it\u2019s not even your guitar. (Let\u2019s not overlook Michael Anthony who knows exactly what to play to keep the session moving and grooving.)  After Eddie hit the scene guys like Paul Gilbert, Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, and Yngwie came along and were probably faster, each with their own sonic signatures. But they all owed a debt to the trail Eddie had blazed. I\u2019m not even sure how many of the shredders of the 80\u2019s would have gotten contracts if record execs weren\u2019t all hoping to \u201ctap\u201d into a bit of Van Halen\u2019s success. Where does he rank all time? I don\u2019t know. But I would rank him as number one for the 80\u2019s. ",
