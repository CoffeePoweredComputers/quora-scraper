            "answer_text": "Let me start by saying that all art is a way of communicating, from the artist to their audience. Also, note that the skills in one field can overlap with those in another field\u2014photography and film, for example. Oh, yeah\u2014in this list, \u201cinclude\u201d should be understood to mean \u201cinclude, but not limited to.\u201d Visual Arts include painting, drawing, photography, design Tactile Arts include sculpting, weaving, architecture, choreography Performance Arts include acting, dancing, singing and performing on musical instruments Language Arts include poetry, story-telling through words, writing scripts for plays and films, musical composition We could waste time quarreling about which art works belong in which category, of course. For example, there is definitely something tactile in a well-made book, and graffiti uses visual art to enhance (or even contradict) words. And virtually anything (cooking, for example) can be thought of as art if, for example, it changes the way a member of the \u201caudience\u201d sees their world. ",

            "answer_text": "Calliope is the superior Muse. She inspired Homer as he wrote The Iliad and The Odyssey. She accompanied kings and princes to help them impose justice and serenity. Calliope is the protector of poetic works, the rhetoric arts, music, and writing. Calliope is usually depicted with laurels in one hand and two Homeric poems in the other.Clio is the protector of history. In ancient Greece, the word for \"history\" was \"clio\" (which is derived from \"Kleos,\" the Greek word for the heroic arts). Depictions of Clio portray her holding a clarion in her right arm and a book in her left hand.Erato is the protector of lyrical and love poetry. She holds a lyre, love arrows, and a bow.Euterpe is the protector of songs and poetry of death, love, and war. She created several musical instruments and inspires the creation of beautiful music. She is often portrayed with a flute in her hands while her other instruments surround her.Melpomene is the protector of the tragedies. She created rhetoric speech and the melodies of tragedy. She is typically depicted holding a tragic theatrical mask.Polyhymnia is the protector of divine hymns. She created geometry and grammar. She is usually depicted wearing a veil and looking up to the heavens.Terpsichore is the creator and protector of dance. She also created the harp and education. She is usually depicted with a laurel wreath on her head while she holds her harp and dances.Thalia is the opposite of Melpomene. She is the protector of comedy, the sciences (including geometry, architecture, and agriculture,) and symposiums. She typically holds a comedic theatrical mask in her depictions.Urania is the protector of celestial bodies. She created astronomy, and she bears stars, a celestial sphere, and a compass.I found these on a site called Owlcation.",
