            "answer_text": "If you are referring to movie songs that don\u2019t have the vocals and how they are made - usually vocals reside in the center of the song. Use Audacity Open the MP3 fileSplit the stereo song into 2 tracksInvert one of the tracksConvert both tracks to monoAnother way to do this is to use Vocal Remover from the menu. You may additionally use Compression and EQ to further eliminate some frequencies. However, bear in mind, these processes do not always work on all songs - if there are effects such as Reverb, Delay they could bleed into other tracks or the vocals could creep into other tracks thereby leaving some traces of vocals after the above process. Removing too much vocals could take away some instruments from the center as well. There are plenty of tutorial videos on YouTube on how to eliminate vocals from a song.

            "answer_text": "\u201cKaraoke track\u201d can refer to any musical rendition of a song sans vocals, from MIDI files, to original tracks that have the vocals \u201cremoved,\u201d to professionally re-created renditions of songs. I am going to assume you\u2019re referring to karaoke tracks that you can buy from a store, or that you can find being used by DJs in bars. These tracks are (99% of the time) not the original tracks, but professional re-creations of the original music that are made to sound like the original recordings. Some companies do this very well, where you usually cannot hear the difference. Other companies do a horrible job and create tracks that do not sound even close to the original. However, even with the good ones, if you listen closely, you can hear very subtle differences from the original track and the karaoke track. ",

Yes, it can be done, and there will be residual voice on the recording. It\u2019s called a karaoke filter, and it can also pan the vocals onto the right track.Artists obtained an instrumental version of the track.As for the graphics, well, I don\u2019t know which karaoke making software to sell you; whatever karafun uses, I guess; don\u2019t know how to use it.

            "answer_text": "I am no expert, and pray experts correct me if I am wrong, but it should work this way. Songs consist of different recorded tracks layered together, like the drums track, guitar track, percussion track etc, the backing tracks, and the singing tracks. Tracks are layered together to make the song. This is also why if you listen to some songs with earbuds on the two buds play different things. When making a karaoke track, I assume you just take away the track layer where they sing. ",

But I think some of the tracks have video or they used to So it\u2019s matter of syncing your lyrics with the song measures In a studio setting 1- they probably have a singer do the song with the band 2- Use the vocals to sync the lyrics with the music track 3- delete the vocals 4- and mix it down?
