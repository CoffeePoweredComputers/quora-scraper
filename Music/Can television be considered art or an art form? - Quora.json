            "answer_text": "It's hard to generalize TV as an art form, because it is so varied. If film is considered an art form, then TV should be as well. Many of the same crafts go into the creation of both. In terms of the crafts with the most purely artistic merit within TV, writing is at/near the top. Still photography is an art, so to should be cinematography. Not to mention the vast number of crew members with the term 'artist' affixed to their positions (e.g.: production artist).  Putting aside the art by proxy argument, TV in recent years has come close to a novelistic form on many occasions. THE WIRE was created by David Simon to unfold like a novel. TV has evolved quickly in the last 10-15 years, and a great resource on that is \"The Revolution was Televised.\" Though not an academic book, it gives great insight into how at least a small corner of TV has not just become art, but arguably high art.  One of the greatest things about TV is its ability to mine deep into its characters, something even film can't touch. TV has given us some of the most complicated characters that we collectively have a strong attachment to and strong opinions on. The Tony Sopranos and Don Drapers that populate the landscape are some of the deepest characters ever to grace any art form. This is thanks to many different inputs, specifically brilliant writing and acting, that can be considered art.  Sure there is a lot of lowbrow junk on TV, but that type of material populates every art form. The fact that it is a business first makes the creation of (or search for) superior content more difficult. It just took a longer time for TV to reach its true capabilities, and has a smaller pool of quality because of it. Ultimately, art is born from the need to tell a story creatively, and even the lowest forms of television do that. ",
