            "answer_text": "All these networks you mentioned are mainstream media (MSM). MSM reports objectively, which is unfortunate for our current POTUS. Most people in the US lean left, not necessarily liberal left, but left so these news networks cater to that audience. These networks are very reputable with fact-checking and fact check Trump\u2019s interviews. We have a POTUS who is a serial liar and MSM networks who report objectively will deconstruct his statements to a tee. This is not being political; a liar is a liar and it does not matter which political party you are in. What makes it political, though, is when the news reports negative news against the POTUS even though it's true. According to Bloomberg, which is considered very neutral, reported that the US is ranked as the 4th worst country handling this pandemic. This is one of many examples of why Trump and his administration have given the MSM many reasons to be against Trump. Watch Axios reporter Jonathan Swan interview, Trump, today and how Trump claims everything is under control. Should the media give Trump a pass for on how is handling the pandemic? Swan made an interesting point on how Trump is applying positive thinking to the pandemic. Swan said that positive thinking is an idea that if you keep believing in something, it will actually happen. Trump applies this positive thinking to the pandemic. Unfortunately, positive thinking does not work when applying it to the actual death toll. Trump tells Swan that we have the lowest death toll based on cases and Swan told him that he was using the ratio based on population. Trump\u2019s response, \u201cYou can\u2019t do that!\u201d Watch the full \"Axios on HBO\" interview with President Trump MSM does not want to make enemies with any POTUS. They want to get interviews with them to boost ratings. Fox News found a niche by supporting him and ignoring his gaffes. Ignorance is bliss and if you just want positive things that he has done, then MSM is not for you. You can see by the chart where Fox News ranges between skew right and hyper-partisan right. The further you deviate from the neutral zone the less reliable the news becomes. Could this be because they don\u2019t report all of Trump\u2019s activities?  Most news networks fall between neutral to skew left because that is where the majority viewing audience is located. As you can see from the chart, the dense cluster of networks is located skewed left from neutral. This is not a coincidence, but a strategic position for networks to attract optimum viewership. Objective news is a commodity and will not get you high ratings. Opinions and commentaries are where the money is. To have an opinion, you are either for or against something. NBC, CNN, CBS, and ABC choose to have their opinion lean against Trump mainly because it aligns with their objective reporting which is following the facts. This may be why Fox News gets very high ratings. Fox News is overweight with opinionators such as Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson who cater to a conservative audience. CNN, in kind, has many opinioned reports such as Cooper, Cuomo, and Stelter who lean more against Trump. Trump and his administration have given the public very few things to cheer about. Polls conducted have revealed that the pandemic is the most concerning issue with Americans and reporters want answers to how the POTUS will deal with it. They are asking questions that the public wants to hear and when the president deflects the question it frustrates the media as well the public. Maybe if Trump did more action rather than blame others and showed he cared for others, the MSM would be more favorable than against him. ",

            "answer_text": "Unfortunately news isn\u2019t news anymore\u2026 it\u2019s entertainment\u2026 (and money) The major networks made a choice with their broadcasting license: Choose either \u201cnews\u201d, which comes with stipulations from the F.C.C.; requiring disclosure, accuracy, mandates equal time for opposing views, et al. (And news departments typically cost significantly more money to operate.) OR, Choose \u201centertainment\u201d, which has none of those requirements. With the advent of reality based programming (which is really high emotional storytelling, and mostly fabricated by ratings hungry producers), the major networks realized they could generate far greater incomes by using some of the same techniques. So, as ratings went up, so did profits. Money is the real motivation. If you search, you can find hidden camera interviews with producers and executives of CNN where they blatantly admit \u201cit\u2019s only about the money and ratings. We know Trump didn\u2019t collude with Russia, but we\u2019re going to push it anyway. Truth isn\u2019t necessary, it\u2019s all about ratings and dollars.\u201d In the early years of real news, many journalists became aligned with the Democratic Party, as they felt that was the party of the people, and Democrats \u201cgave better access\u201d to the breaking story, while Republicans were less likely to leak a story. Eisenhower, the Vietnam war, Kennedy assassination, Nixon and Watergate, etc. contributed to this alignment, which continues to this day. However, back in the day, reporters did not share their personal opinions and vent anger-based diatribes on their news segment. They provided facts, and moved to the next story. Today, it\u2019s all a \u2018reality show\u2019 ratings game in the battle to make more money. So anything false can be shared as news, because (they can claim) it\u2019s really just \u201centertainment\u201d. In addition, many news organizations do not like Trump because he seeks to disrupt the \u201cswamp\u201d (the established, corrupt, hidden group in Washington, comprised of Republicans and Democrats, who work together to control money, agribusiness, stock markets, one-world government, income, etc). These swamp members are some of the main news sources for the media. The swamp uses the media, and the media uses the swamp. If Trump disrupts the swamp, he breaks up the partnerships the media has become dependent on. But mostly, it\u2019s all about making money. And as we\u2019re seeing, you can make more money by publishing hateful, untrue stories about Trump. ",
