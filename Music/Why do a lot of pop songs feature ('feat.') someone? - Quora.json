            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Because it is a time of blending styles, of lot of experimentation and freedom of expression in art. 'Featuring' is a good way to blend two different styles, but also to  reach out to the fans of the other artist and spread the influence. Consider this song from Robert Thicke:   The song could totally  go without  Nicky Minaj, but it will be like many songs before  it, and also, would have reached to less people. If you go to the comments  section you will find a lot of comments about and fans of Nicky. It is a very interesting fusion of two different artists. I personally, never had appreciation  for Nicky (not that I didn't  want to, but because her music was not what I was ordinary used to listen). Now this song brought the wonderful artist in Nicky more closer  to me and I developed appreciation and curiosity  about her music. This is because of the power of this fusion of two or more artists (especially  from different  genres) together. So, it is about  experimentation, business (influence) strategy for the artists, and in the end, it is a trend! ",

            "answer_text": "Just as pointed out by Jason the real reason why most musicians these days feature other musicians on their tracks is because they want to increase their reach. The impetus can come from both sides: Example A: A lesser known musician contacts a well-known musician, asking for collaboration. The well-known musician realizes that the lesser known musician has potential/talent and agrees to collaborate. Example B: A well-known musician features a lesser known musician that is either signed by the same label or because the well-known musician is actually the mentor of the lesser known musician and wants to boost the reach of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9.  p.s. the music industry is quite complex and most artists don't really have a lot of \"freedoms\"(career-wise). Unless they launch their own labels they are more or less slaves to the respective record label that they were signed to. There are many horror stories which highlight this dilemma: How Signing a Major Record Deal Nearly Destroyed My Career   ",
