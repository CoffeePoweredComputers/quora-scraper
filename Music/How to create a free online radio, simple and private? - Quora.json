            "answer_text": "If youre doing a private station this will work:  http://djsizzly.com/content/broadcasting-your-home-computer. It's certainly not suitable for a public station.  You could also take a gander at ampache which seems pretty slick as a personal media server.  That being said, you'd probably get more mileage out of a DLNA server. MediaMonkey has a fabulous one. It's what I use to present audio and video to my house. ",
