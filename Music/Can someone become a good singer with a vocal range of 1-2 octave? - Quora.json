            "answer_text": "YES, but the person will always be limited in the repertoire he or she can sing. Most songs in the pop repertoire do not need a 3 to 4 octave range, they are most commonly found in classical music. However, when it comes to more daring or challenging pop music, not being able to span a 3 to 4 octave range will limit which songs you can cover. A prime example recently is Ariana Grande. She has a huge range up to 4 octaves, allowing her to improvise on the lead and showcase her range. Being able to cover such a range makes you a more dynamic singer because you can express yourself in more frequencies. ",

            "answer_text": "Henry Mancini was once asked to write a song for a movie. Audrey Hepburn was the actress/singer, and Mancini was told she had only a nine-note range. He sat down at the piano and played a note, then the 9th. That was the range he had to work with. He then dropped down a whole tone, to the octave above the starting note. Those three notes became the basis of one of our best-loved songs. Play them, and you\u2019ll immediately recognize Moon River. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello, Of course you can. Having a wide vocal range is not a necessity to being a good singer. Two octaves is plenty to sing almost all varieties of music. Some very famous singers have a very limited vocal range. My student Sir Rod Stewart never had no more than two octaves of vocal range throughout his whole career. I think he did just fine with it.
