            "answer_text": "My favorite song has changed so much this year. I\u2019ll see if I can think of my favorite each month. I know some of my favorites this year, just need to remember when they were my favorites. January Sweet But Pyscho by Ava Max Let\u2019s just say that my one friend played this song too much around me and it kinda stuck. February Smells Like Teen Spirit by Nirvana I still enjoy this song, but at the time I was playing a singing game with my friends and we sang this one like 50 times. March March was my Avril Lavigne stage of 2019. Not sure which to call my favorite though. It\u2019s either What the Hell or Here\u2019s to Never Growing Up or Girlfriend or Smile or anything, just not Sk8er B0i even though I love it, just not my fave. April Did I have a favorite in April????? I think April was just me listening to many different things. I don\u2019t know\u2026. May Forever and Always by Taylor Swift This song just happened to be my favorite coincidentally. There are details that I don\u2019t want to share. June Pretty much everything from the new Aladdin soundtrack. The entire month of June. Then I got to go see it for my birthday. July My Beatles stage. I\u2019d probably say my favorite was Ob-La-Di or Yesterday. August Never Surrender by Corey Hart I had like just finished watching Stranger Things 3, and was listening to my 80s station on Pandora. This song came on, and I realized it was from Stranger Things and I almost cried. The song is just so fitting. September Every Breath You Take by the Police Still on my 80s/Stranger Things kick. Love love love this song still. It played at swim practice and I didn\u2019t want to keep swimming. I wanted to sing so loud, but didn\u2019t. October Burn the Ships by For King and Country I still love this song, but in October I heard it so much. (more than other music) November Pumped Up Kicks by Foster the People I first listened to this song in October, towards the end. And I LOVED it so much. I don\u2019t know why. December 3 AM by Meghan Trainor or No Good For You by Meghan Trainor My friend just introduced me to these songs. THEY ARE SO GOOD! ~~~ There you have it\u2026 My favorite/s for each month of the year. Overall favorite???? I have to say either the Meghan Trainor, Beatles, Taylor Swift, or Never Surrender. It\u2019s too hard to choose. Mandy ",
