            "answer_text": "We'll assume you have your first bass and amplifier.  You'll need personal instruction to learn how to dial these in.  To play the bass is fairly straight-forward from the novice level.  First, get a metronome; you can download one to your smart phone.  Practice tapping your left and then right foot to the even beat; do not get fancy with this.  Next, get tablature of the major scales and, using the metronome, practice maintaining an even beat on the different notes.  Use a heavy pick on the 'fat' side or your thumb or your first two fingers.  Listen to your favorite music and practice finding and playing evenly on notes that 'fit.'  Using the tablature, find the 1, 3 and 5 notes of the different scales and practice moving smoothly between  them.  You don't need an amp this but to have some sound most amps do have a headphone jack or you can acquire a 'SansAmp' and these allow you to play without threats from the neighbors or roomies. This will get you started.  If you're focused you can be minimally capable in about 20-hours.  YouTube has tons of instruction.  Have fun. ",

            "answer_text": "Learn the damn songs. Know them well enough that you know when the guitarist(s) has it wrong. Well enough that you can tell him what the chords on the recording are. Notice that\u2019s not the \u201ccorrect\u201d chords. Saying that probably won\u2019t fly at rehearsal. Devise parts other than what\u2019s on the record that still fit and benefit the song. This is what takes you from regular bass player to really good bass player: improvisation. Soloing is not the only way musicians improvise. Figured bass in Baroque music requires the continuo player to improvise a full part based on a few symbols. Sound familiar? ",
