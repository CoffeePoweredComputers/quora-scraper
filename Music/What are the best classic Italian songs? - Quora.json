            "answer_text": "If you ask for clasic songs I feel like I need to go back in time looking for the origins of the Italian song. Now, obviously songs were sung long before Italy became a thing, but they were often not sung in Italian, rather in the local dialects. Here are a few examples of such traditionals. Basically each region, each small province had its own musical style.    Around the half of the XIX century there have been signs of the birth cona national song, with \u201chits\u201d such as Santa Lucia, Ciribirin, and La spagnola. Often the success of these songs was due to the new faschion of caf\u00e9 chantant, imported from France.    Beside these lighthearted or romantic songs, the strong patriotic push also spawned a number of songs, some true hymns to the patriotic wars or to its heroes (Addio mia bella, addio or Inno dei Bersaglieri), some telling the stories of those left behind (El pover Luisin).    The first decades after the Italian unification were characterized by colonial wars in Africa (Mamma mia vienimi incontro - Canto di soldati Italiani in Africa) and by mass emigration towards the US and Argentina (Mamma mia, dammi cento lire). There were also inner migrations, from south to north, which sometimes were related to famous crimes, so the homicide of Rosetta, a Milanese prostitute who refused to take a pimp (traditionally, the Milanese prostitutes were 100% indipendent).    WWI marked the start of the myth of the Italian Alpini, the mountain infantry. Many popular songs kept the patriotic theme going (La canzone del Piave). But more and more often songs expressed an increasingly open critique to war ('O surdato 'nnamurato, O Gorizia tu sei maledetta).    The postwar period was characterized by strong political upheavals, and the songs became increasingly political, from the Socialist hymn Bandiera rossa (which later became the anthem of the Communist party) to the Anarchist song Addio Lugano bella, to the Fascist hymns such as Giovinezza.    During the Fascist dictatorship all political expression that wasn\u2019t aligned with Fascism was forbidden, so songs were either fascist or lighthearted. Some of these light and fun songs were nevertheless small jewels. Often under the disguise of these songs, though, American jazz (formally forbidden) peeked into the Italian radio.    Italian songs of the WWII and of the years that followed it saw the rebirth con the political folk song, with partisan hymns such as Fischia il vento, I banditi della Acqui, or the work and protest song Se otto ore vi sembran poche.    But the 1950\u2019s als brought on a renewed optimism and desire to go back to lighter songs that were as far as possible from war. We have the great romantic songs such as Grazie dei fior, of the light and fun take on Italian music, contaminated by American jazz, by Renato Carosone (Caravan petrol) or Fred Buscaglione (Eri piccola cos\u00ec).     These were also the years when the Italian musical exploded with infinitely popular songs (Attanasio cavallo vanesio, Rinaldo in campo).   Meanwhile, a generation of innovators started peeking its nose. The vocal quartet Quartetto Cetra, Domenico Modugno, Johnny Dorelli (L\u2019immensit\u00e0 is a later song, but it\u2019s just fantastic), Mina, Giorgio Gaber.     At the end of the decade, rock and roll landed in Italy, along with latin music.    The early sixties saw yet another innovation, with the first wave of the singer-songwriters. Piero Ciampi, Sergio Endrigo, Gino Paoli, Luigi Tenco, Enzo Jannacci,      Great modern feminine voices broke into the scene: Mina, Milva, Patty Pravo, Iva Zanicchi, Ornella Vanoni, and Italo-French Dalida.       Right behind them, beat music (here spelled bitt) spawned a number of Italian bands, which most often would sing Italian covers of international songs: I corvi, I nomadi (yes, the same Dalida\u2019s song with different lyrics), Equipe 84, I ribelli (check out singer Demetrio Stratos, he will pop up again later).     The early 1970\u2019s saw the singers that had been innovators in the 1950\u2019s turned into the new establishment. Opposed to them there was a new series of singer-songwriters, often with an even more explicit political streak. Fabrizio De Andr\u00e8, Lucio Dalla, Ivan Della Mea, Francesco De Gregori, Francesco Guccini (also author for I nomadi), Ivano Fossati, Ivan Graziani, Rino Gaetano, Gianna Nannini, Lucio Battisti.           It was also the decade of the Italian rock, which soon took on progressive traits. While I nomadi were still going strong this time with a more original repertoire, Yu Kung and Stormy Six are the most political, Area is fronted again by Demetrio Stratos, by now the most important and creative Italian singer (probably of the whole XX century). And also PFM, Napoli Centrale (actually, just like Area, an international project) and Banco.        The 1980\u2019s marked in italy a clear change in sound and attitude. The mainstream music returned to the forefront. Rock and singer-songwriters opted for a lighter attitude (Vasco Rossi, Zucchero) or went looking for new sounds (Franco Battiato, Alberto Fortis, Enrico Ruggeri).       Rock turns its head to the new wave with a series of new bands like Litfiba, C.C.C.P., Moda, Gang.     Then the 1990\u2019s cme, and we are basically in the contemporary age, so no more classics. (And, yes, my classics are not the same a other people\u2019s.) ",
