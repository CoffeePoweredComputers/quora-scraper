            "answer_text": "The short answer to the question above is no. Music streaming payouts don\u2019t work on a per play basis, and for some reason this is not being explained clearly to artists/musicians and journalists. There is full reporting and accountability and the principle for music streaming is a solid one for artists if they understand it. So how do you generate a royalty payout from music streaming?: A song play is counted if a track plays for longer then 30 seconds.At the end of a month the total plays is added up and a track is given a percentage of total plays rating.On average around 72% of what consumers pay in that month in music streaming fees is then calculated as being payable for royalty.The artist/label is then paid out based on the play percentage that their tracks had for that month of the total \u201cdue to labels\u201d pot.e.g. If there are a million consumers paying $10 a month then the money payable to labels is $7.2 million incl taxes. If an artist had their tracks being o.5% of plays then they would earn $36 000.00 for the month. If they get to 3% of plays then they would earn $216 000.00 in that month. Music streaming gets a bad rap because of the free ad-supported model. There is a lot less revenue per month per consumer so a % is worth a lot less. Then bizarrely its calculated on a per play basis which makes it look even worse. I do not personally support the free music streaming side as I think its a rip off to artists with 80% of the consumer using free never moving to the paid tiers. ",

            "answer_text": "Definitely no, Spotify says that you must listen to a song more than 30 seconds, then this play will be counted as a stream, and you may get royalty. But whether you get the corresponding royalties or not, this cannot be determined. Because there are many factors, such as: the country the listener is based in, the percentage of paid subscribers Spotify has on its books at the time, and the artist\u2019s own deal with their record label. In order to ensure that the playing time of the song is greater than 30 seconds each time, and each listener is from a different country, you can use the Spotify play generator. It allows you to customize the duration of each song, and specify accounts from different countries to play. In the software, the playback time is a time range, such as 31-120 seconds, which means that it will specify a time in this range, which can be 31 seconds, 32 seconds, or 119 seconds, and then play the song. This makes the playback of the song look more humane. Besides, the stream generated by the songs played by the software will receive royalties, because its Anti-Fingerprint technology that completely replicate human behavior makes it possible to bypass the detection of Spotify.
