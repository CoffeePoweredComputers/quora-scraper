            "answer_text": "This is a complex question and in turn requires something of a complex answer. Acoustic: (of popular music or musical instruments) not having electrical amplification. Firstly, acoustic performance can be understood in different ways: A grand piano is considered an acoustic instrumentBrass instruments are considered acoustic instrumentsWoodwind instruments are considered acoustic instrumentsWould you consider an acoustic guitar running into a PA/acoustic amplifier to be non-acoustic? If I\u2019m understanding correctly, I think you are referring to what\u2019s modernly called an \u201cacoustic\u201d or \u201cunplugged\u201d version. An acoustic version is usually similar to the original song but is played by swapping electrical instruments (electric guitar, electric bass, drum kit) for more traditional instruments (acoustic guitar, upright bass, hand drums/brushes). Nirvana famously popularized this style in the early 90\u2019s when they appeared on MTV Unplugged So why is it that some songs sound better unplugged? For this answer, I shall bring to light the story of one of the most influential characters in the late resurgence acoustic movement: Elliott Smith  Elliott started off in a band called \u201cHeatmiser\u201d Heatmiser was a typical early 90\u2019s grunge scene band, who played quite loudly. They played so loudly in fact that Elliott, the lead singer, complained of having to \u201cscream at the top of his lungs to be heard over the band.\u201d Elliott grew tired of screaming, and luckily, was able to leave Heatmiser after his debut EP Roman Candle suddenly became popular. Roman Candle was truly a proper debut for the young artist, as Smith had been writing the songs on the album since he was in high school and the work showed. The style of Roman Candle ran perpendicularly to what Smith had been performing in Heatmiser, as his new album was a soft acoustic one. Although oftentimes misidentified as folk music, Roman Candle came to be known as one of the most intimate, and morosely brilliant works of acoustic music of all time. Elliott's distinct four track style (two vocal tracks and two guitar tracks) allowed him to layer out an inexplicably haunting yet beautiful tone. Elliott\u2019s newfound sound could never have come to reality in a band such as Heatmiser. What Smith was longing for was something more intimate, something so subtle that it\u2019s able to reach out and touch you in a way that something screamed at you never could. Now for my favorite Elliott Song:  ",

            "answer_text": "The clarity of the lyrics has to play a big part. More of a connection with what was going through the songwriters mind. The easy listening factor... You may not always be in the mood for rasping heavy metal, but you will always be receptive to gentle simple sounds, even though you may not admit it for social/self image reasons. ",
