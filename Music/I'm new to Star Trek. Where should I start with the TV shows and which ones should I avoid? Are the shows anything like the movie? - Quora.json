            "answer_text": "You say you love sci-fi, but it is a broad and wonderous genre. I think where you start with Star Trek depends on the things you like most within sci-fi. If you enjoyed the new movie (the 2009 one or Into Darkness? ST Beyond? Is that out yet?) you may expect a similar level of action in the other movies, if not the series themselves. But one of the complaints long-time Star Trek fans have of the reboot (post-2009) movies is they try to make Star Trek into action movies. If you like the action, big explosions, that kind of stuff about the new movies, try watching the new movies first. From there, I might suggest Enterprise. While lots of fans like to pretend Enterprise never happened, I\u2019ve never minded the premise and actually enjoyed several episodes. I\u2019ll admit, it\u2019s hit-or-miss. But it\u2019s the most recently produced series, so it was written most like modern TV series go. So if you liked the action-y side of the new movies, I might get into Enterprise as your first series. Other answerers have made specific episode suggetions. Instead, if it was really the characters and their relationships and personalities that drew you in, I would go for the Original Series movies (there are six of them) next. Same characters, but in a different timeline with different circumstances. The characters are much more mature in their relationships to each other and just age-wise. In fact, the last couple touch on aging and retirement and change in the universe - but it\u2019s not dull or depressing at all. About the Original Series movies - it\u2019s generally accepted that the odd-numbered ones are bad, and the even-numbered ones are good. The first movie (just called Star Trek: The Motion Picture) can pretty much be skipped. The second, third, and fourth movies are kind of a unit and can be watched together. The second movie, The Wrath of Khan, is absolutely classic. It builds on a character from a single episode of The Original Series called Space Seed. The episode is less than an hour long and totally worth watching right before the movie.The third movie, The Search for Spock is \u2026 a little weird. But it follows from the second and sets a few things up for the fourth. I won\u2019t say skip it, but it\u2019s not the best.The fourth movie, The Voyage Home is just pretty fun. It\u2019s more lighthearted and has tons of fun scenes. The crew time-travels back to the present day of 1986 when the movie was released, so there\u2019s a bit of added fun there \u2026The fifth movie - The Final Frontier - is \u2026 terrible. I\u2019ve only watched it twice (which is saying something, because I\u2019ve lost count of how many times I\u2019ve watched the other Star Trek movies). It has one redeeming scene at the end with Kirk, Spock, and Bones sitting around a campfire singing Row Row Row Your Boat. Sorry if I spoiled the ending.And finally, the sixth movie, The Undiscovered Country. This is my favorite movie of all the Star Trek movies. I could go on forever about how great it is, but I\u2019d recommend it to anyone. As for a series, if you really liked the character aspect of the new movie(s), I would obviously recommend The Original Series (TOS for short). As with the movies that came after it, it\u2019s the same characters in the original timeline. Of course, TOS was made in the late 60\u2019s, so beyond the expected differences in special effects, costumes, and what was considered \u201chigh-tech,\u201d the series was created at a time when people didn\u2019t record the episodes and didn\u2019t buy them on DVD or watch them on-demand. There was really no such thing as a multi-episode story arc like has become common in TV shows now. Each episode is much more stand-alone and sometimes things stated in one episode may contradict something stated in a previous episode. So if you\u2019re looking for something more character-focused that has season-long story arcs \u2026 go for Deep Space Nine. It has a different set of characters than the Original Series and tends to be a bit darker. Since it\u2019s set on a space station rather than a ship that can move around, there tends to be less action and fewer space battles, but tons of character and relationship development. Now, the ones I haven\u2019t mentioned yet \u2026 The Next Generation is my favorite series and the one I grew up on. When I was 3, I had a little Picard action-figure and a plastic combadge! Maybe it\u2019s just my experience growing up with it, but I feel it\u2019s the most \u201cfamily-friendly\u201d Trek there is. Captain Picard is not the kind to throw punches (and get his shirt torn) like Kirk was. He\u2019s much more the philosopher, and episodes tend not to have as much fighting and shooting. The first few seasons have the grand optimistic view of the universe, I\u2019d say even moreso than TOS, but they also tend to be a little on the dull side. There\u2019s even a rather terrible teenage character that ends up in many episodes, even. The last few seasons get better, there is more drama and deeper examination of the issues the episodes present. The Next Generation movies are a pretty good bunch. The first, Generations, gives a send-off to Captain Kirk and tries to tie the Original to the Next Generation. First Contact finally tells the story of one of the most important events in the Star Trek universe\u2019s history, and while it can be watched as a starting point to get into Star Trek further, I think it\u2019s best enjoyed with some understanding of the characters and of the Borg. Insurrection is a great combination of all kinds of elements - you have an idyllic planet setting with little technology, you have fun, lighthearted moments, a child with a tiny adorable pet, you have big explosions and space battles, and you have great examination of deep issues. Voyager is the other series fans tend to ignore. I personally don\u2019t hate it, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that great either. I haven\u2019t watched nearly as many episodes of Voyager as of other series, but I would describe most of it as another new, \u201cnever-before encountered\u201d problem every single episode. Finally, The Animated Series. I have seen fewer episodes of this than even Voyager. It came from the 70\u2019s, and, as the name implies, is animated. The episodes are half-hour-long instead of hour-long and it only lasted for two seasons. According to Wikipedia, it \u201cwas the first Star Trek series to win an Emmy Award.\u201d The animation takes a bit of getting used to, especially for fans of a show that has been overwhelmingly live-action. Basically, if you\u2019re already a sci-fi fan, you probably know how it goes to \u201cget into\u201d a show or franchise. If you\u2019ve been through it with another already, you know all about wading through the groan-worthy episodes, or the episodes that fans like to ignore, just to enjoy every piece of it. Star Trek is no different in this matter. There are absolute brilliant masterpieces and there are ones that leave you wondering what exactly happened that this would make in on screen. But in the end, it\u2019s all worth it. Hope it helps! ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what you want out of Star Trek. If you're looking for fast-paced action that's basically just Star Wars with a Star Trek veneer, then the JJ Abrams films and Star Trek Discovery are your place to start. And probably finish, because Star Trek is NOT about the action\u2014or the drama. If you're looking for the real Star Trek experience, start with The Next Generation. It's a fan-favorite, and for good reason. I personally rate it lower than other series, but for newcomers this is absolutely the bread-and-butter series. Star Trek: The Next Generation is great because of its extremely-diverse cast and characters, it's got lots of interesting episodes, and it is the prime example of posing questions to the audience that makes us think. I like to see Star Trek as a show that explores space to explore our humanity. We learn lots of great things about ourselves. We learn appreciation of other cultures, and an appreciation for our own. We get to see a bright future for humanity. It's really great to sit down and talk about this future, talk about the hard things in this life, but in a science fiction setting. If I were to recommend one show out of all the others, it would be this one\u2014even if it personally isn't my favorite. If you want more of a serialized series, my go-to is Deep Space 9. Very well-written, DS9 continues The Next Generation\u2019s style of exploring humanity by exploring space, but without the same planet-of-the-week style storytelling. Most of the show takes place on one space station\u2014but that by no means makes it any less of a show! It's really great as it fleshed out the universe barely touched on by Next Gen, and it creates a really great plotline involving several different factions in the galaxy, and Sisko is an awesome Captain. It's definitely worth a watch. I also enjoy Voyager, but I understand that this really isn't everyone's favorite. I loved the Lost-in-Space aspect of the series, but more than that, Captain Janeway is my hero. When I was in middle school, I was bullied and teased for being a Mormon nerd in a Baptist-hick community. My life was miserable as a kid, and the ONLY thing that kept me from killing myself at that age was watching Voyager reruns on PAX TV. Janeway taught me to stand up for myself and my beliefs, even if I stood alone. She taught me to do the right thing, even if it was the harder decision. While I'm not a woman, I also think she stands as a shining example to women everywhere, because she not only confidently leads the ship, but doesn't need to prove herself better than the men on the show. She was equal to them, even if she was the superior. The men on the show didn't need to be stupid or incompetent for Kathryn freaking Janeway to shine, and I LOVED that. Compared to Michael Burnham (the female lead in Star Trek Discovery), Janeway wins any day because of who she is and how she got to sit in the Captain's Chair. So my personal favorite is Voyager, despite its bad reviews. So in sum: JJ Abrams movies/Star Trek Discovery - if you want action and derivative storytelling. Next Generation - if you want a good starting point that offers more than just entertainment. Next Gen deals with political and military type interactions between factions planets governments and peoples. DS9 - if you want Next Generation but with far more storytelling and connected episodes. DS9 deals with socioeconomic issues including trade religion cultures and practices. Voyager - I don't really have an argument for you to watch this one other than it means a lot to me personally. lol. Voyager deals heavily with morality and ethics. Many episodes explore gray areas of right and wrong and ends justifying means. These are just generalizations of topics. All three have a few episodes that dabble into the focus of the others. Hope this helps! Welcome to Starfleet! ",
