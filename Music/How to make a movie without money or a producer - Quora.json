            "answer_text": "Question: How can I make a movie without money or a producer? When you don\u2019t have a large amount of money or a producer then it will be a bit hard for you. You have to think outside the box to compensate for what you are lacking. Because if you want to make movies like they do in Hollywood but don\u2019t have the money for it, you\u2019ll end up making a wasteful mess. Ask yourself, why do you want to make a movie? Do you have a great idea for a film? If you do then that is a good start. Some movies that have made it big in the box office didn\u2019t even have big budgets, all they had were unique stories that were executed with not-so-mainstream type of storytelling. Here a few examples: Open Water - Budget: $500k Box Office: $52MNight of the Living Dead - Budget: $114k Box Office: $42MNapoleon Dynamite - Budget: $400K Box Office: $46MThe Blair Witch Project - Budget: $60K Box Office: $248MThe blockbuster movie that has the most surprisingly low budget of all is: Paranormal Activity - Budget: $15K Box Office: $193M",
