            "answer_text": "Smartphones detect location using cell towers,  GPS and WiFi signals (using large directories that map the location of individual WiFi networks)  Android and iOS operating systems provide Location Services to applications based on these signals, saving app developers from the trouble of writing code to deal with low-level location data.  To protect privacy, when applications are installed, they ask the user to give the app permission to access Location Services, and most users just say \"OK.\" If you want to change Location Services access for an iOS app, go to Settings>Privacy>Location Services, find the app, and change the setting. Common choices are \"Always,\" which continues to share location data in the background, \"Never,\" and \"While Using the App\" An Android expert can comment with the equivalents. ",
