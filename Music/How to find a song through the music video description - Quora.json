            "answer_text": "There\u2019s this song that I have been trying to find forever\u2026 I only remember the music video though. It starts off with what I presume as a memory of a boy when he was younger playing with bubbles with his mom. Then it goes to him as an adult sitting in his car staring at a graveyard. There\u2019s another scene where it\u2019s another memory of him as a kid and he comes home and finds his dad or grandpa on the couch with a beer in his hand sleeping, so he tries to take it but the grandpa gets up and starts yelling at him so the boy runs out of the house and walks down the sidewalk. Then there\u2019s another scene where a chef gets yelled at by a top chef and gets fired and walks outside and hits the side of his car. I believe the song is by a white rapper or singer cause I remember him in one of the scenes. Last scene I remember is back at the man staring at the graveyard until he decides to go to a liquor store to buy some sort of alcohol to bring to some grave. Then it shows him placing the alcohol on his (maybe grandpa/dad?)\u2019s gravestone, then his wife shows up beside him. If anyone knows this pleaaaase let me know!! ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s this one music video I\u2019ve seen when I was younger that Ive been trying hard to find since but had no luck so far. The music video is shot in a big white empty room in daylight (you can tell because there are windows each on two sides of the room parallel to each other with white light shining through.) In the video, the lead singer is hovering in the middle of the room while the camera rotates anti-clockwise around the room rather fast while focusing on the lead singer in stop-motion style. At one point, there\u2019s a close up of the lead singer singing, \u2018yeah\u2019 as part of the song\u2019s lyrics, then there\u2019s a close up of his feet hovering off the floor. Thoroughout the video, several objects appear and disappear (mannequins and speakers, I think). Near the end of the music video, the whole scene changes to nighttime. Song had bit of a Presets-like sound to it, but with a more gloomy, mysterious tone to it. Also, the song tempo was around 120pm approximately. If anyone can figure out the name of the music video/song with these details, let me know in the comments below. Cheers. ",

She is getting hit on by a guy and she gets upset and leaves. As she is walking away the lights in the office dim and the overhead florescent lights flash directionally to a room where a band plays. She floats to this room and dances there. During the main part of the song the band randomly flashed on screen in different colors as she dances. The music video ends with the lights to the room, which is a public bathroom, being turned on by an old lady. The girl immediately stops dancing and leaves the room. The lyrics may say something about dancing, but I cannot recall. The band was all Male and the lead singer had dark brown shaggy hair. Any help would be appreciated! ",

It was about 3 AM in my hotel room when I opened my tv that brought me to this music video, which looked like it played a good 1 and a half minute already. The female artist looked a bit like marilyn manson, had quite bigger teeth, and the music video was creepy, but very hooking. There were only 2 alternating scenes in the mv: one where the artist was in a farm with two other creepy creatures: she was wearing a white clown costume, had bright red lipstick and orange brown hair. A long, inanimate, black furry figure and another indistinguishable creature accompanied her. The other scene was a close up of her in pale white skin, with black paint on some parts of her face, with black lipstick and thick black eyeliner, and a hood. The song was very calm, and the melody of the chorus was repetitive, more especially at the end. If someone knows or has encountered the mv please tell me :<<< thanks ",
