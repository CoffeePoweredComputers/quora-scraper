            "answer_text": "Like many other creative types including aspiring artists, singers, writers, and actors they opened a stall in Kensington Market for 10\u00a3 a month and enjoyed the camaraderie among the other sellers. Their particular stall was so small that friends referred to it as a \u201ctelephone booth\u201d. They sold \u201codd pieces of art and antiques they had acquired chiefly from friends\u201d. They were not experienced in the business trade nor selling antiques, or \u201ceven junk which is how most of their friends described their wares\u201d so they soon relied mostly on selling second hand clothes. However, at one point they bought a hundred fur coats from a merchant for 50\u00a3 and sold them each for 8\u00a3. Although it was indoors and three stories Kensington Market sounds a lot like what we in the US call a flea market but catered to the hippie and bohemian culture during the 60s and 70s and was considered chic. It was even frequented by the likes of David Bowie to whom Freddie sold a pair of boots when he was filling in for a friend\u2019s adjacent stall at the time. Once Roger accidentally (hopefully :) sold Freddie\u2019s own jacket forcing Freddie to run after the buyer with the money to get his jacket back. Unfortunately, the market no longer exists or I would be sure to visit it in London someday. Interestingly, its wiki page includes the fact that Freddie and Roger had a stall there. Kensington Market, London - Wikipedia Update\u2014Just happened to come across an interview with NME in which Roger talks about their stall: \u201cHow was Freddie as a business partner on the stall. Did he look after the money?\u201d \u201cBloody hell, no [laughs]. That would have been an absolute disaster. You could say Freddie took care of\u2026 the, er, artistic side. I used to spend my student grant on the rent of the stall and we were very hand to mouth. We did it for about 18 months, it just kept us ticking along when we'd first started Queen. But when we'd run out of art to sell courtesy of Ealing College we got into old Edwardian clothes, but then we found we were starting to drift towards the rag trade\u2026 and we were fairly shit at it.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Around 1969 Roger and Freddie opened a stall in Kensington Market. They continued it after queen\u2019s first album so they were still doing it after 1973 because they hardly earned anything from their music. what did they sell ? Freddie's own artwork ( he said later in an interview that he regretted selling them..), they also sold second hand clothes, and a bit of everything of not very good quality as Brian said ! Freddie also got a 2nd job in this market but alone not with Roger. I can\u2019t remember which year though.    ",
