            "answer_text": "Well I am a person and I like Country Music so I'll tell you what I like about it. Country Music is like Jazz. I mean real jazz. I mean Dean Martin, Michael Bubl\u00e9 jazz. There's a definitive beat that can be danced too and where jazz normally only calms you it makes you feel an emotion. Country Music can calm you, fire you up, get you \u201cin your feels\u201d because real country isn't written with making it on the radio in mind. It's written because they were inspired either from their own life or from hearing a story from another's life and so they wrote a song. That is why I like real Country Music because it is about real life. ",

            "answer_text": "Not being a hardcore fan of the music and growing up in a liberal home where it was strictly forbidden (but music was otherwise appreciated), I can say that the simplicity and directness of the emotion are appealing. Lots of genres make you want to dance and sing, but the combination of good story telling in the lyrics combine with the style of singing and that pedal-steel guitar can bring me to tears. Jazz, blues and reggae never do that to me. ",
