            "answer_text": "Yes. Even those with a natural talent for singing have to learn correct technique, which can only really be taught/coached. It definitely helps to have knowledge of musical theory, but it isn\u2019t essential. There are a few essential things to learn about in order to become a \u2018serious\u2019 singer: Breath control. I cannot emphasise enough how important this is. I also can\u2019t emphasise enough how much you don\u2019t realise how important this is until you start to do it properly. It unlocks parts of your voice you didn\u2019t know were there.Tone and timbre. This is all to do with the unique characteristics of your voice, which, once you master Breath Control, you will have a lot more control over.Vocal styling. You should be aware of the kind of music you\u2019re singing, and make appropriate stylisations to suit. You wouldn\u2019t sing barbershop quartet music in the same way you\u2019d sing a pop song - a pop song has much more scope for ad-hoc decoration.Visual presentation and styling. Again, different styles of music and performance settings require different visual styles. I find this particularly difficult to master as it\u2019s easy to just look as if you\u2019re concentrating on singing correctly!There are loads more techniques that will be specific to the genre/style, but singers train, practice, and get coaching for years in order to get to where they are. Even raw talent isn\u2019t necessarily enough to get you very far without some basic skill work. ",

            "answer_text": "Is it hard to sing well? Not if you do it every day. The one thing I know that would help someone starting out is projecting their voice. You\u2019ve got to really connect with the notes. You should treat it like any instrument, and if you want to be great it would be good to find someone who knows what they\u2019re doing. If you plan on learning stuff like the right techniques, sight-singing, improvisation, it\u2019s really best to have someone who is competent enough to teach it to you. ",
