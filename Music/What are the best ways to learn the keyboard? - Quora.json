            "answer_text": "You\u2019ve really activated my trap card. I could talk about this all day. Better use of the thumbs Our thumbs are very strong and agile. It therefore seems a shame to relegate both to a single shared key, when our other fingers have the opportunity to use multiple keys. We should get rid of the giant shared space bar and ensure there are multiple keys for our thumbs to operate. Better ergonomics \u201cBetter ergonomics\u201d is quite broad, so I\u2019d focus on two areas. Firstly, if we separate the two halves of the keyboard, we can move them further away from each other to better accommodate our shoulders and wrists. The standard keyboard design forces us to \u201cturn\u201d (deviate) our wrists quite a lot, which is not comfortable in the long term; and it forces our hands close together, which in turn causes tension in our shoulders and necks. Secondly, our fingers are not great at side-to-side movement. There is no reason for the rows on a keyboard to be \u201cstaggered\u201d like a typewriter keyboard. (This is a design holdover from typewriters that should have died out a long time ago, but such is the power of legacy.) Better key layout Some people believe that alphanumeric layouts like Dvorak or Colemak are inherently better. I don\u2019t know whether this is true. What I do know is that the standard keyboard layout makes some very strange choices about which key to put where. For instance, Caps Lock is by definition not a key that you need to hold down to operate, whereas Ctrl is. So why is Ctrl placed in the furthest corners of the keyboard, where you have to stretch your pinky if you want to hold it down, while Caps Lock is placed in a close and convenient position? A common improvement that many power users make is to use software (or specialised hardware) to swap the positions of those two keys around. There are potentially many such changes we could make, such as putting held keys in the thumb position, where it\u2019s very easy to hold them down while hitting other keys. Similarly, some keys could perform dual functions. Outside of gaming, a key like Ctrl is never tapped, only held. So we could easily make that key perform a different function, such as Esc, when we tap it without pressing anything else. This is another common hack that power users apply to get more functionality out of the same set of keys. Smaller layout Related to the above, the standard 104-key layout is too big. It requires hand movement, which is one of the biggest causes of poor keyboard efficiency, in order to access all functions. It is better to restrict the physical layout of the keyboard to a set of keys that can easily be reached, and find ways to map all desired functions to that set of keys. (As an aside: the standard keyboard layout also forces the mouse further to the right, outside of the optimal zone where you have maximal comfort and range of movement. Anyone who plays mouse-driven games seriously should use a smaller keyboard for their matches so that they can use the mouse more comfortably and effectively.) Some ways to map many functions to one key have already been discussed above. There are others, too. If you\u2019ve used a laptop keyboard in the past ten years, you\u2019ve probably had a Fn key that you could hold down to access additional functions on keys. This concept of \u201cfunction layers\u201d is very powerful, especially when you make the Fn key readily accessible & employ more than just one function layer. For example, you could let the Fn key access layer 1 when held, and toggle to layer 2 when tapped.  These are, as far as I\u2019m concerned, the most important things we can and should improve with the standard keyboard. Luckily, specialist keyboards are available on the market today that have all of these features. I own an Ergodox EZ that has all of these features, and I couldn\u2019t be happier. I only hope that mainstream manufacturers (especially laptop manufacturers) feel brave enough to take some risks & present the mass market with a better, more powerful, more comfortable tool. ",

            "answer_text": "I donno why but keyboard instrument is little underrated musical instrument in both Indian and western music industry since 2000\u2019s. Its because, many people knows that most of the music production and background scoring happens on keyboard instruments, whether it be MIDI keys or standard performance keyboards or synthesizers, they have been a crucial part of overall music development. But most of the credit or wows goes to guitars and percussion\u2019s, nowadays DJ consoles. with the rise of craze for EDM music, and the advancing technologies, people are going crazy over pop and EDM music, not realizing that its the keyboard instruments which provides all the samples, loops and melodic grooves and not the piece of computer software's. So basically, if we connect the dots here, people should learn to play keyboard instruments along with sound processing units like DSP\u2019s or oscillators. There are many tutorials out there that\u2019ll teach how to play keyboard by explaining music theory and all that shit but if we think of latest taste of majority, we should be able to combine our music playing theory with sound theory. Now you must be thinking what is sound theory ? Well its important to know how different sounds work in different situations and what impact it has on us. There are basic parameters which could be learnt while understanding sound theory. Nature of sound (high/low pitch sounds)DynamicsIntensityTimbre/textureOnce we understand these parameters, we should be able to manipulate these parameters to get our desired tone (texture) of a particular voice from our keyboard. Just like a DJ manipulates his/her sounds from his mixer/vinyl desks. The sounds could be manipulated by using sound/signal processors. With the help of these processors, we can have following effects on our keyboard: Reverb and chorusResonance and decayFlanger and phaserlow and high pass filters and many many more. . .I have made a video on how to play your keyboard like a DJ, kindly have a look  Now, just imagine, if we know to play our keyboard along with live manipulation of sounds that we play, we can say that we are actually playing our keyboard \u201cgood\u201d Hope that helps. . Show some care by sharing this ahead. Upvote if you find this helpful. :) Cheers ! ",

The facetious answer to the first question would be, \u201cWith your fingers.\u201d The facetious answer to the second question would be, \u201cPractice a lot.\u201d But I presume you are asking a serious question and looking for a serious answer. Your question doesn't give any information about your present level, whether you already play at all, whether you can read music, whether you play other instruments, whether you are already a proficient keyboardist looking to get better. As a generalization, if you're starting out, I suggest you learn to play an acoustic piano first. You will learn much more about music and technique that way. It is easy to switch from acoustic piano to digital keyboard. Unfortunately, as many will tell you, it doesn't work so well the other way around. As far as using the capabilities of the digital keyboard, which is not my area, I think it depends partly on what kind of keyboard you have, whether you have been able to afford an expensive one, and exactly what you want to do with it musically. In any case, an experienced and qualified teacher here is a must. ",

            "answer_text": "Your teacher will probably guide you towards a suitable beginner book. Complete Keyboard Player has a set of 4 early learning books and then lots of other Songbooks, Pop, Jazz and Blues, movie Music, Disney Songs and many other categories, once you have some basic learning done. Pay attention to learning chords. If you have your left hand positioned so your little finger is on G and your thumb on D, you can reach all the notes you need to play all chords comfortably. Some, like G and A minor, will be in root position, but many chords will be in inversions. If you can learn them well, one or two at a time, or as those new chords appear in new music, your fingers will be able to find them quickly. Playing keyboard isn\u2019t just about playing the right notes at the right times. It is about using all aspects of your instrument. So you will need to investigate the different voices and rhythms you can use, to make your music sound unique and interesting. And don\u2019t forget the intros, fill-ins and endings too. The best way to learn keyboard is from a teacher that has mastered the instrument. He or she will give you structured lessons. That is what you need. Structured learning. ",

I will wait. why yes, you cannot do it. on a Mac there is way to remap the keys to mean different things. for example you can make CAPS-LOCK (go away you evil useless thing) into Control. this is found in the Keyboard system preference. remove ridiculous keys or change function / label to make the key useful. Print Screen does not actually print the screen. and to make it do a a screen shot is too many steps. what do the keys Pause / Break do? dunno? nothing ever pauses or breaks when I press it. Num Lock is marginally useful but why is it a whole key? it should be a nub or a tiny switch. Scroll Lock? who wants to not scroll? away with this antiquated left overs of early computing. if the keyboard costs more than $50 it needs to be impervious to spills. ",

The letters \"KW\" make the exact same sound\". Alan thus suggests that Kwik Fit is Turkish. In 90AD, a Roman emperor stated that the letter \"Q\" was redundant except for the purpose of attaching vowels to itself. That emperor was called Quintilian. Languages that do not use the letter \"Q\" include Estonian, Icelandic, Latvian, Polish, Slovenian and Danish. Denmark abolished the use of the letter from native words in 1872.
