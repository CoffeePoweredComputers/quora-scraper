            "answer_text": "There are many. Edward has already given Procul Harem\u2019s \u2018A Whiter Shade of Pale\u2019, which is based on Bach\u2019s \u2018Sheep May Safely Graze\u2019, but this was not the only song by Procul Harem based on Bach. \u2018Homburg\u2019 was as well. King Crimson\u2019s \u2018The Court of the Crimson King\u2019 is based on a riff from Samuel Barber's \"Essay for Orchestra\" . Lennon once said that \u2018Because\u2019 was inspired by Moonlight Sonata backwards. There does seem to be some inspiration there, but not backwards. \u2018Revolution No. 9 is a very close but very bad copy of sections of Stockhausen's \u2018Hymnen\u2019. The Beatles had attended lectures on \u2018Hymnen\u2019 given by Luciano Berio at the London Academy of Music. There were some direct Classical hits. Steeleye Span\u2019s version of \u2018Gaudete\u2019, a Latin Carol, charted. \u2018Mozart 40\u2019, a slightly speeded up version of Mozart\u2019s 40th with a percussion track added hit the top of the charts during the \u201870s.
