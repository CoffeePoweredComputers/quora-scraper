            "answer_text": "I, myself was searching for a way to get lyrics for the Sony Walkman app. All I can find is: 1.) I have to save the lyrics in (.lrc format) for all songs, which I think no one will do. Its better to search on google than that. 2.) Use Musixmatch to get synced song by a tap on the floating Icon. If you skip the song ahead or change the song the lyrics won\u2019t change instantly. Personally didn\u2019t like it much. 3.) Using Walkman lyrics extension. Didn\u2019t like it too. But if you want to use some other app. Try HTC Music App, it is powered by Gracenote (Global Music Data Collector). The only thing that you have to take care of is the name of song, artist and album should be accurate. That\u2019s it and enjoy the song with synced lyrics with just a right swipe. Here are some recent screenshots: 1.) You Say - Lauren  2.) Rap GOD - EMINEM  3.) Unravel - TK  4. ) Without ME - Halsey  I loved HTC Music app. If you want to update music info use STAR Music Editor. and delete it. But, obviously Walkman has better interface. So I am finding a way to get lyrics in it. UPDATE: Well, I am back to HTC. Walkman has a bug it deletes the playlist automatically. Stable Version: APK files - Google Drive Do upvote, if it helped. :) ",

Musixmatch synchronises the lyrics with the song itself. moreover musixmatch can also be used to play songs or listen to them online. ",
