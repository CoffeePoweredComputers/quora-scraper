            "answer_text": "I would not worry too much about whether your business is software or hardware - it\u2019s about getting the business fundamentals right. Of course, the cost of your startup is going to be a lot lower, if it\u2019s a software product (it\u2019s not exactly $0 of course, but it\u2019s close to zero).  It is only a good idea to start a business if you know that you can get the following right (regardless if you run a hardware or a software business): You have to have product/market fit.At the end of the \u201ctesting road\u201d, your overheads must be covered by your income from the business - it really is that simple - no money in the bank = failed business.You can\u2019t succeed if your company is not customer-centric.\u2014 When comparing to software business, here are the disadvantages of a hardware business: a. Costs of purchasing and storing the hardware. b. Knowing exactly how much of the stuff to purchase - i.e. at the start your expenses will fluctuate greatly, while you try to figure out the demand each month/quarter, so be prepared for that (make sure you have enough cash to cover your behind for that period). c. Hardware may require much more complicated processes in terms of customer support and maintenance/repairs if it breaks down. \u2014 The above does not mean you should only consider doing a software business. If you see an opportunity in the market that others don\u2019t, and you find your own niche, then go for it! ",
