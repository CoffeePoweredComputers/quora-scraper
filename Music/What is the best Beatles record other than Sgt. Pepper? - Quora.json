            "answer_text": "I disagree with the premise of the question. Sgt. Pepper is far from the best Beatles\u2019 record. For me, it\u2019s probably not in the top-five, but may be 6th or 7th. Of all their records, I think it\u2019s aged the worst. That said, the newest version of it, which was produced by George Martin\u2019s son and combines the best of both mono and stereo elements, is a wonder to hear and did put the album in new light for me. I recommend it highly. As others have said, the Beatles\u2019 best work is likely Revolver, with Abbey Road and Rubber Soul as close seconds. The White Album is a massive, brilliant masterpiece, but for me falls to third or fourth because it\u2019s really not a group effort. They were falling apart when they made it and there wasn\u2019t really any teamwork. The Beatles were best when they worked closely together. However, the songs on the White Album and the sheer variety, along with the musicianship, make it one of their peaks. Other Beatle albums that I tend to listen to more than Sgt. Pepper include Please Please Me (which captures what they sounded like before they got famous and was recorded mostly live in the studio); Beatles for Sale (under-rated but with some of the best harmonies and cover songs they recorded), and Help (which features masterpieces like the title song, Ticket To Ride, Yesterday, I\u2019ve Just Seen a Face, etc.). Another one frequently getting accolades is A Hard Day\u2019s Night, which has a lot of great songs but is so dominated by John that it seems like a Lennon solo album rather than a Beatles\u2019 album. MMT is a pastiche of different singles patched together with some uninspired new songs like Flying, Your Mother Should Know), and With the Beatles is great but not really an improvement from Please Please Me. I enjoy Let it Be now and then, but it\u2019s far from their best. I see Sgt. Pepper as more of a period piece, interesting from an anthropological and cultural perspective but not an album I\u2019d necessarily want to sit down and listen to that often. Maybe my list of their best LPs would look like this: RevolverRubber SoulAbbey RoadThe White AlbumPlease Please MeHelpSgt. PepperBeatles for SaleA Hard Day\u2019s NightLet it BeMMTWith the Beatles",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d re-frame this: What Beatles albums are BETTER than Sgt. Pepper? I\u2019ll start with a premise here: Sgt. Pepper is a great and ambitious album, but its success is really based on a handful of songs. These tracks are Sgt. Pepper/With a Little Help From my Friends, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, A Day in the Life. None of the remainder are terrible, but those identified in my list are really highlights that define the record. Beatles albums better than Pepper? Revolver. Tomorrow Never Knows is the towering achievement of psychedelia. Taxman is George\u2019s best song (and a rocker with Paul\u2019s greatest guitar solo) until he submits While My Guitar Gently Weeps. Paul\u2019s melodicism is a consistent homerun: For No One, Here There and Everywhere, Good Day Sunshine. And Lennon is also in top form, offering I\u2019m Only Sleeping, And Your Bird Can Sing, and She Said She Said. Better than Pepper? The White Album. Acoustic paradise (Blackbird, Julia) and a gritty rock band that can be HEAVY. Helter Skelter, Yer Blues, Birthday, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, and more. There is variety, ambition, confidence, and surprises; the playing and singing have grown and evolved. Better than Pepper? Abbey Road. If you seek the production values of Pepper and felt that Pepper worked as an entire record, Abbey Road\u2019s suite on side two buries it. It also has possibly the most potent one-two punch of opening songs (Come Together/Something) and the greatest denouement in rock history. Sgt. Pepper is in the first tier of Beatles triumphs, but I would argue that the three I\u2019ve identified here are more adventurous, ambitious, rewarding, and successful. ",
