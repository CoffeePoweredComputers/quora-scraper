            "answer_text": "Since 2013 Netherlands has turned their fortune around so it was only a question of when would they win. Imagine, only a decade ago Netherlands could only dream of going to finals. Liked the song from the beginning. Reminds me of Coldplay, my favourite band so that is a plus. However I thought the live performance was a bit disappointing. He was hidden by that big piano and he barely looked into the camera. Still a worthy winner with a good song! I think we also can feel joy for Netherlands who hasn\u2019t won since 1975! ",

            "answer_text": "Musically, I think it was a good song with ok lyrics by a good performer with a great network. Also, having seen some (not all) of the other contestants, and having heard others about the rest, I think that the Eurovision should work on increasing the quality of submissions. It might be fun to watch again if it weren\u2019t a contest of \u2018least terrible\u2019. Now, having said that, this means half the country will be arguing about the organisation of the 2020 edition, and that\u2019ll be more terrible and toe-curling than the aforementioned submissions.
