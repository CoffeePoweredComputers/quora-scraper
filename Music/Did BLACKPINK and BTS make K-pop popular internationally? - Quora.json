            "answer_text": "In America, PSY really got it started with BIGBANG and SuJu. But! When BTS and Blackpink came around to America it really popped off. It just went crazy. Now internationally in general, I believe it was Rain, BoA, and TVXQ (?). I\u2019m not sure if it was Rain or TVXQ so I\u2019m putting both. If I\u2019m not mistaken, BoA was one of the first idols to do the whole Japan thing. And as I\u2019m sure you know, she\u2019s a literal queen who walks on air upside down. If you\u2019re questioning my mentioning of BIGBANG and SuJu, both groups were selling out shows in New York and other places in North America. SuJu was one of the first Kpop groups to sell out shows in America. A lot of people (Americans mostly) my age and up really love that group, I grew up with their music the same way I did American artists. BTS and Blackpink definitely have a big play in current international popularity though. There\u2019s no denying it. They\u2019re all talented youngsters. My photo of BTS won\u2019t load but you know what they look like. ",
