            "answer_text": "My verdict is that it\u2019s an overhyped service and it suffers the same problems as Google Palsy Music. Compared to Apple Music and Spotify it feels like crap. There\u2019s no desktop client to sync my playlist, library and stuffs between my desktop and my phone. It\u2019s a half baked product just like Google Podcast.Not every song is available on it. However if I buy something from Bandcamp or any other source I can\u2019t just add it to the YouTube Music library to get it synchronised between all my devices (no desktop client, duh). On other hand with Apple Music subscription anything I add to my iTunes library gets synchronised with all my devices via cloud, no need to be connected to same WiFi or anything like that, you add your third party mp3, it gets uploaded to your cloud and synchronised across all your devices. Compared to Apple Music this half baked music service called YouTube Music feels primitive.It\u2019s overpriced, my Apple Music plan is a family plan which is shared between me and my 5 other buddies. The monthly fee for Family Plan is around Rs 190, but since it\u2019s shared between six of us our per head monthly fee is barely around Rs 32. That\u2019s hell lotta cheaper than the Rs 99 per month fee of YouTube Music.So essentially, it costs more, it has no additional advantages, it has less features, it has no desktop client, its adoption in India is just a stupid fad. Do you seriously believe anyone who is used to more refined music services like Apple Music or Spotify will ever like a half baked service like YouTube Music? I don\u2019t think so. ",
