            "answer_text": "For me, it has got to be Octavarium.  The reasons being: Freaking 23 minutes long song with multiple time signatures, intricate guitar solos by John Petrucci where he sweep picks so insanely fast with such virtuosity that it makes it seamless to listen to it.Fast double bass drumming sections and complex drum arrangements by Mike Portnoy.Fantastic keyboard solo by Jordan Rudess which really sets the mood up.And lastly the soaring bass by John Myung.All perfectly cohesive of each other makes it a technical masterpiece.
