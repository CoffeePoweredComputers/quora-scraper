            "answer_text": "I listen to a variety of music, including Alternative Rock, Melodic Death metal, country, blues, soul, instrumental (guitars mostly, sometimes a santoor solo), a little Pop and EDM. And yes, Indian :D So there's a different emotion generated for each genre. Alternative Rock and Melodic Death metal makes me feel aggressive and attentive. Especially metal, since I pay attention to all the instruments being played and notice the change in the chords being played on the guitar. Although the lyrics make me feel sad, the meaning of each line is ocean-deep. Country, Blues and Soul makes me relaxed. It's smooth and the music tends to be refreshing. Also, the emotions with which Blues singers sing, it's amazing. You get soaked in the melody. Pop and EDM is fun to listen to. Mainstream Pop today has no lyrics to reflect onto, so it's fun when I'm travelling. Everything tends to repeat, so I don't bother about it much, and it serves well as background music. The more sensible pop music, like Baroque pop and Indie Pop are interesting. They give a similar feeling as country/blues does. Unfortunately, this kind of Pop is not mainstream. EDM may be repetitive, but it seems more intelligent even without lyrics.The pace and the drops make me feel like I'm the life of an imaginary party :D. It's fun, I feel good and I would certainly start dancing on it even if I had company on the road. Instrumental makes me attentive and ultimately, peaceful. Of course, there are some fast paced, aggressive instrumentals. They give the same feel as metal.I have listened to a few symphonies from composers like Mozart and Beethoven. They have been beautifully haunting for me; enough to stick in my head for a long time. And finally, Indian (I am not just talking about Bollywood). The melodious voices make me wonder my country's talent and capabilities. I wouldn't brag, but there are such great singers and musicians in India that their music connects you with God (as my mom quotes, to which I agree). Edit: Rock and Metal transport me to a concert where I'm singing, jamming and head banging :D ",

            "answer_text": "I want to share with you some text I once wrote after listening to a particularly inspiring song. I think it shows the range of emotions I feel when I listen to it. Here it is: \"Some music is different. It enters your brain and you become consumed by it. For the duration of a song there is nothing in this world other than you and these sounds that make you see explosions of colour when you close your eyes. You feel like you are somewhere else entirely. You are flying over the land at exhilarating speeds and with breathtaking scenery rushing by. Your chest feels light and you want to open your mouth and laugh like you have never done before. You are in outer space and the stars are strewn all around you. You cover immense distances in a heartbeat, there are butterflies in your stomach and you have never felt freer. You are standing on a rock in the middle of the ocean and the raging waves crash at your feet. You raise your arms and the waves follow your gestures. You have all the power in the world. You are in your mind and the music is there, making you feel all these things simultaneously. You are overcome with emotional turmoil and you feel your eyes start to water from joy. You cannot possibly surpress a smile that quickly becomes a wide grin of pure happiness. This is bliss.\" I cannot guarantee you will feel the same. The song is Monody by The Fat Rat. Hope you like it as much as I did. ",

            "answer_text": "To listen to music is an absorptive experience. It is chosen via personal tastes and interpersonal recommendation and their tastes. It embodies to me a specific emotive state, and a harmony of sound a la human ingenuity. As a fine art, music is neither true nor false not subscribing to norms of many disciplines and followed work. It does not take much effort to realize that everyday conversation is a rational overlay on very basic sound gestures. A world of meaning is created over the most basic auditory perception. ",

            "answer_text": "If I\u2019m walking: I think about how it could be danced to. I think about what kind of dance would suit the music and if it should change during different parts of the song. I think about where lifts, dips, or drops would make the most sense. Also, I think of how acting can be used to tell the story of the song and get the audience involved. I also sometimes let it be the background for daydreaming. I have different playlists set up for some of my common daydreams (mostly fantasy themed). If I\u2019m driving, I like to sing along to just about anything. There are also some songs that are linked to stories that I\u2019ve written. I think of them as being like theme songs. Those stories always come back to me when I hear the song again. ",

Next few times, I\u2019ll analyze the score (music)and/or the lyrics (words). I like to know why I like something: is there a chord or key change or a turn of a phrase that strikes me as genius; has the artist taken a simple melody and made it complex or vice versa; is it soothing or grating; would I want to listen to it as I go to sleep or as I\u2019m waking up? P.S. Just been listening to Boxer Rebellion\u2019s new Ocean by Ocean album, and it\u2019s a killer. ",

When I get stuck at a really hard problem, I listen to pop music with a lot of beats.This gives me motivation to keep going and not loosing hope. But when I'm on a normal base of work , I just listen to soul or blues which helps me to concentrate. I can't explain how it works but I feel like if you take away music from me, it's like you took away my skills. I have no more anything motivating me sitting behind a desk for hours and looking at boring code. ",
