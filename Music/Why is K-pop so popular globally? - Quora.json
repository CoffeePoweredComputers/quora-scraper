            "answer_text": "In one of Chungha\u2019s interviews she was asked about something like this and this is how it went Interviewer: \u201cI have to ask I don\u2019t know what your gonna say. But why do you love K-POP so much?\u201d Chungha: \u201cwhy do you? Why do you that\u2019s my question?\u201d Interviewer: \u201cnow you put it back on me\u201d [laughs] \u201cbecause I can\u2019t understand the lyrics.\u201d Chungha: \u201coh right\u201d Interviewer: \u201cright most obviously most Americans can\u2019t understand the lyrics but yet we will just repeat the song over and over again. I don\u2019t know is it fashion? Is it the dancing? Is it the stories you tell in the m/v? I don\u2019t know.\u201d Chungha: \u201cmaybe like, I don\u2019t know because I also love music in different languages too and a lot of Korean people might not understand English as well as you might not understand a lot in Korean, but we still listen to pop music. I think it\u2019s pretty the same. You know music is one.\u201d Interviewer: \u201cgood music transcends\u201d Chungha: \u201cyeah, it makes all into one. I think that\u2019s just you know everything equals out\u201d in conclusion, I agree with Chungha all music is equal and you know like a lot of people DIDNT understand despacito (sorry if i misspelled it) including me but I still liked that song. So I think the reason for it being so popular globally is because it\u2019s actually good music. I have met a lot of American friends that transferred to my school and would be humming or singing a Korean song but not understand it. So as Chungha said music is one that\u2019s why it is so popular globally.  It starts at 9:33 ",

            "answer_text": "Catchy, upbeat music that gets stuck in your head.  I kid you not, that is how I got into it. My friend introduced me to Sorry Sorry by Super Junior and I was hooked. It was a phase of my life I will not forget.  Where I'm from, it's not that popular, but I live in a small town. The closest city 5 hours away plays k-pop on radio stations. Not just Gangnam Style stuff, but true k-pop- songs from Super Junior, SNSD, etc.  When I went to China, K-pop was relatively popular. I'd say Chinese music was still more preferred though. Indeed k-pop has become popular globally- however, I ask a few of my friends in Korea and some of these idol groups are a nuisance to them. There are people who love idol groups in Korea, but a lot of people view them the same way we view Justin Bieber, Iggy Azalea. They grow tired of them.  Other reasons:  Attractive young Korean men and women who're fashionable and talentedSkilled young dancers that other dancers may feel inclined to view them as role models or copy their dance styles (and in turn, become interested in k-pop)The music videos that are interesting Music that is catchy and keeps you entertained even if you don't know what they are saying The glitz and the glamour of the k-pop industry I'd say a large portion look up towards these artists because of how attractive they are. Then there's fandoms that people love being a part of with inside jokes. It's all different reasons for different people. ",
