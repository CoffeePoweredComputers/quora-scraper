            "answer_text": "Not all Bengali movies copy, there are many original movies too. But yes, most of the big budget Bengali movies with big stars shamelessly copy from South Indian movies. We may accuse Bollywood for copying South Indian movies, but the fact is, compared to Bollywood, Bengali industry has more no. of big budget movies which are shamelessly copied from superhit Tamil & Telugu movies. Forget story & script, they even copy the wardrobes & background music from South Indian movies. Sometimes you may feel that you are not watching a Bengali movie, you are watching a Bengali dubbed South Indian movie, where the Bengali culture & essence is missing & we witness only South Indian culture. For example, the Tamil movie \u201cSingham\u201d was remade in both Hindi & Bengali. In Hindi, it was Ajay Devgn starrer \u201cSingham\u2019 & in Bengali, it was Jeet (the Bengali superstar) starrer \u201cShotru\u201d. Both the films released in 2011 within a gap of 2 months. Now, most of the scenes from Hindi \u201cSingham\u201d was copied from the Tamil movie except the climax. I was surprised that Rohit Shetty changed the last 20\u201325 mintues & gave his own touch to the film, where Ajay Devgn shoots Prakash Raj & turned this into a suicide case, which was missing in the original Tamil movie. But the Bengali movie \u201cShotru\u201d (I watched it in a theater) was an exact copy of the Tamil movie. There was no original touch in the Bengali version unlike the Hindi version. Director Raj Chakraborty shamelessly copied each & every scene from the Tamil movie from first to last. But thankfully, the \u201ccopy\u201d trend is slowly (though not entirely) fading away from Bengali films, thanks to the Hindi channels where popular South Indian movies are telecasted in Hindi everyday. And since Bengali people know Hindi very well, they watch those Tamil & Telugu movies now sitting at their homes instead of going to the theaters to watch the copied Bengali version. That\u2019s why movies like Arundhati (the Bengali \u201ccopy\u201d of Telugu movie \u201cArundhati\u201d) & Yoddha (the Bengali \u201ccopy\u201d of Telugu movie \u201cMagadheera\u201d) failed miserably at the box-office, because people had already watched their original versions in Hindi atleast for 100 times on tv channels & youtube. So why should they watch the copied Bengali versions in theaters spending rs. 80\u2013100 when they can watch the original movies in Hindi on tv channels & youtube for free? That\u2019s why nowadays such movies are not working at the box-office. But after realizing that their \u201cSouth formula\u201d isn\u2019t working, now some directors have gone one step ahead & have started to copying Marathi & Punjabi movies, since these movies aren\u2019t telecasted in Hindi. But still people aren\u2019t liking them. But thankfully, there are directors like Srijit Mukherjee, Koushik Ganguly, Shiboprosad-Nandita, Anik Dutta etc who make original movies with rich content & audiences are also liking such kind of movies. That\u2019s why the biggest grosser Bengali film of 2017 was the movie Posto, a courtroom-cum-family drama directed by Shoboprosad Mukherjee & Nandita Roy. Most of the commercial films didn\u2019t get that much success, including the movie One, the Bengali \u201ccopy\u201d of critically & commercially successful Tamil movie \u201cThani Oruvan\u201d. Mainly the directors like Raj Chakraborty, Ravi Kinagi, Raja Chanda etc make copy movies, and these films are the big commercial movies which are the main source of revenue for the Bengali industry. Since these big movies aren\u2019t working these days due to their \u201ccopy-paste\u201d image, our Bengali industry is in a very bad state. As the megastar of Bengali film industry Mr. Prosenjeet Chatterjee said in various interviews, big commercial movie directors should come up with original stories instead of blatantly copying from South Indian films, and that\u2019s the main way to revive the Bengali film industry, because these big movies are main source of revenue for the industry & that;s why these movies need to do well at the box-office.

            "answer_text": "I would not agree that all Bengali movies are copy of South Indian movies. But yes , a majority of commercial masala entertainers used to be remakes of south movies. The primary reason for this was audience were loving such movies - punch dialogues , build ups and over the top action scenes - so obviously instead of investing in fresh thoughts to churn out entertainers it became easier to purchase copyrights of those entertainers ( majorly Telugu and Tamil ) which have already faced the audience test. Everything was fine as long as the movies were hit. They have even remade many average hits.However , producers failed to understand that such commercial movies have always found favour with Telugu audience , but the formulaic movies started reaching the saturation point in case of Bengali audience. With south movies getting dubbed in Hindi , it slowly started to turn out that the remakes were losing audience attention. Producers turned their attention to lesser known Kannada , Marathi and Punjabi movies ( Since Odia movies are themselves busy in remaking south movies , Bengali movies have probably not yet remade them ). In the interim period , producers also faltered in not identifying / creating unique commercial plots suiting the Bengali nativity. However , the positive is that the no. of remakes have started slowly diminishing ( though a long way to go ). With original movies like Posto easily winning over audience , even stars have realised the need to do original movies ( Jeet - Boss 2 and Dev - Champ , Zulfiqar , Cockpit ) and give their own touch to commercial entertainers. I always felt Malayalam movies if remade in Bengali would easily find audience acceptance than other south movies ( badly wanted Prosenjit Chatterjee to star in Drishyam remake or for that matter even Oppam would be a good choice ) . But the problem is producers only want to remake \u201c commercial movies\u201d. But i guess Bengali industry can take note of the trend in Kannada industry ( not asking to remake Kannada movies ). In the previous decade , there were lot of Tamil - Telugu remakes ( including some mediocre movies ). They used to copy even the costumes and retain the original movie frame by frame. However , Kannada audience too after a point were not too keen on over the top action sequence or too raw elements. When Kannada audience started watching the original movies , remakes slowly went out of favour and they longed to see movies with unique storylines. This has resulted in diminishing no. of remakes by top stars and increased acceptance of coming of the age movies. Even in case of remakes , the focus has shifted to Korean , Malayalam movies and in case of Tamil Telugu remakes they have opted to remake movies of lesser knowm heroes which are not very popular with Kannada audience and almost no Hindi remakes ( ya I know Queen is getting remade simultaneously in all 4 major South indian languages ). In this sense , both Kannada and Bengali movie industry ( once known for parallel movies along with Malayalam ) have faced similar situation - Golden 70s and 80s , movies based on novels , not allowing dubbed movies , no much outreach / release outside their respective states , limited no. theatres , facing snub by multiplexes , facing competition from other languages movies which are actually distributed by native producers themselves , wanting the state govt. to reimburse its share of GST , no year long hyped movie interest among audience , increase in remakes of Tamil Telugu movies even by top stars with retaining sequences which did not suit their nativity , access to original versions leading to diminished acceptance for such movies by audience , longing for movies with native culture with lesser voilence and commercial elements,etc. However , currently Kannada industry is one step ahead in regaining its lost audience ( though still a very long and difficult path ahead ). Bengali industry is facing the situation what Kannada faced few years ago. Hopefully , even Bengali industry picks up quickly in a similar manner by identifying and respecting the audience choice of movies. ",
