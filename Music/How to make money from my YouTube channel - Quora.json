            "answer_text": "Yes. Although it can take a couple years. You\u2019re paid on views, but the real long term money is in growing subscribers. 1 million monthly views = $1,000 - $2,000+. It scales from there. I\u2019ve started a YouTube channel with 300,000+ subscribers and six figures in revenue as part of a previous media company. Here\u2019s how we did it\u2026 We already had a large following on a blog in a specific niche so it was a head start. We decided to start by posting one video per week. Having a following on IG or FB would be a huge help versus just doing a cold start. The YouTube channel quickly went from a seed of around 500 subscribers to 10,000 over the first few months. The next 12 months we grew to over 100,000 subscribers and by year 2/3 we had over 300,000 subscribers. After we started getting around $1,000+ per month in AdSense revenue (~month 6 - 12) we reinvested all of it into more content via additional contributors. We increased our video posting from once per week to two to three videos per week on a set schedule. Our video catalog grew to a couple hundred of videos. We had paid contributors. We started with two of our site bloggers and grew the video contributors to 4\u20135 from there. YouTube is about personalities, if you\u2019re going to pay contributors make sure you plan on keeping them around for a long time (and they want to stick around). 20% of your content will generate at least 80% of your views. Your top videos will generate most of your revenue. It\u2019s hit driven but it\u2019s impossible to know what will be a \u201chit\u201d. Learn what your audience likes by testing different formats and optimize from there. If you can get your videos featured on other sites, blogs etc. via embed tags that will be the fastest way to get your content distributed which should lead to more subscribers which will lead to more views. As your subscriber and views increase you will be seen in the recommended content areas on YouTube which will expose your videos to new viewers. The larger you get, the easier it is to grow :) ",

            "answer_text": "How can I start a YouTube channel and start making money? if you want to start a YouTube channel and make money, first you need to create a new channel on YouTube, that\u2019s easy. Sign in to YouTube.com on a computer.Try any action that requires a channel, such as uploading a video, posting a comment, or creating a playlist.If you don't yet have a channel, you'll see a prompt to create a channel.Check the details (with your Google Account name and photo) and confirm to create your new channel.Then you\u2019ll have to make and upload videso on your new YouTube channel for making money, you could simply enable monetize on YouTube to make money, now for a channel to be eligible for monetization, it will have to meet the following requirements: Have at least 1,000 subscribers.Have at least 4,000 hours of watch time within the past 12 months.Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not a hard task. There are some necessary steps that top YouTubers are using to create successful YouTube channel for making money: First, it\u2019s the most important to choose the correct video topics. The key to choosing video topics that your target audience will want to watch is to remember that your product or service is a solution to a specific problem. This is why understanding your target audience, and more specifically, your ideal customer is so important. If you understand what problem they are facing, then you can create videos to help them solve that problem and learn about your business in the process. keep in mind that every guy who is watching your video is watching for his own benefits not for your. It will help you to work from the perspective of the viewers. if you have selected some specific topics(what you want to do) in your mind for your channel, I recommend doing some additional keyword research to validate the demand for those topics. The higher the popularity and search volume there is for your topic, the higher the potential for organic traffic to your video. please remember, inspired content is the kind the viewers want, your efforts are futile if viewers does not find it compelling. To get the most out of your content, you have to determine your audience. Create the kind of quality that revolves around them. Exciting content does not have to come from you all the time. There will come a time when ideas escape you. If you are having a hard time coming up with one, you can scroll through the comments section of the similar popular videos on YouTube. or search the similar videos on YouTube, view the top videos. keep in mind the comments of these videos, know what they want, and you will know what you\u2019ll have to generate. Step 2: Plan and prepare the video Once you've selected some specific topics for your YouTube channel, you need to perfect the whole idea of your video, plan How would the video look like after its created. Please remember, your primary objective is to create a video that is helpful for your target audience. Creating videos that are entertaining and/or inspiring should be your second priority. Every video you create should contain three parts: Part 1. Video Introduction(Video Intro) Introduce the topic you are going to cover in your video as quickly as possible. Most people who search for and find your video won\u2019t know who you are before they watch it. They want to learn about the topic, not about you. Keep your introduction brief and tell them exactly what the outcome of the video. Part 2. Main Content Share your best advice on your chosen topic. If you can be entertaining or inspiring at the same time, great. But above all, share practical advice (no fluff!) that answers a specific question, helps your audience solve a problem, or achieve a specific result. Part 3. End Screen(Video Outro) At the end of your video, if you don't want to loose your viewer after they watch your video, give your viewers something to do. Ask them to share your video, subscribe to your channel, access your website, leave a comment, etc. Never leave a viewer without a specific next step to take. Step 3: Choose a right software to make the Video for YouTube Now, it's time to start making your video. There are many online video editor, but it would be great to have your own software so you have more freedom to modify your video to your liking. I'm a Youtuber 10 years until now, I used and reviewd lots of software, but now I generally use YouTube Movie Maker for all editing, and Adobe After Effect for some advanced special effects(rarely). YouTube Movie Maker is an unique video/audio editing software made specifically for YouTube, provides user-friendly features, with it you don\u2019t need have any professional knowledge to edit videos for YouTube. Please remember, every YouTube video should has both an audio and a video component. Therefore, there are actually two types of editing that need to occur: 1. Video editing - optimize what your viewers see. In this step, you need to edit your source video footage, you'll do things like remove unwanted content, trim video image, add text, add subtitle, add graphics, adjust color, etc. 2. Audio editing - optimize what your viewers hear. The audio quality of your videos should not be taken lightly. Poor audio quality really detracts from someone's viewing experience. In this step, you'll do things like add amazing background music, change audio pitch, fade in/out, etc. Once you completed your video making, save your video as a MP4 video file within YouTube Movie Maker, and include your main keywords for the video in the file name. This can help your video rank higher in search results for your main keywords. Step 4: Publish Video on YouTube Now, your video is ready for publishing, it's time to upload it to your YouTube channel. But you must complete the following steps when you uploading your video on YouTube. 1. Add video title - Give your video a compelling title that includes the main keyword that you chose for your video. Try to keep your title to 70 characters or less (anything longer will be truncated in most search results). 2. Add video description - Your video description appears below your video. YouTube currently has a 5,000 character limit on video descriptions, but that doesn't mean that you should use all 5,000 characters. I recommend writing a brief paragraph (100-300 words) to describe the content in your video. Use the rest of the available space in your description section to include specific CTAs, links to your website, additional resources, your social media profiles, and so on. 3. Add video tags - The appropriate place to add specific keywords to your video (like the ones you identified when you researched your video topic) is in your video tags. We recommend including at least 5-10 similar keywords in your video tags. 4. Upload a custom thumbnail/cover - Your video thumbnail is the image that people see before they click to watch your video. A very attractive thumbnail, along with some text that helps describe the video, can help entice potential viewers to click on your video. If you don't upload a custom thumbnail for your video, YouTube gives you 3 choices of random screenshots from the, which most of the time are not very flattering. Once these steps are complete, go ahead and set your video to Public for the world to see. Step 5: Promote YouTube Video to get more Views The goal of your videos is to attract organic traffic by ranking the search results for their respective keywords/topics. To give your videos the best chance of consistently attracting new viewers on a long-term basis, promoting your videos as soon as they are published helps give them an initial boost of traction, which helps encourage YouTube to rank your video higher than competing videos. so you need to share your video on all your network, your website, blog, facebook, twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, etc. Introspect and think why you actually view others videos and subscribe to others channels, continue to post unique and attractive video content, set target to compete top videos on the search rank, you will have a successful YouTube channel for making money.
