            "answer_text": "Just less than two octaves [by one and a half tones]. To explain what I mean by tones [and semitones], here are the notes in the Western music system [it doesn\u2019t matter what instrument you play - they\u2019re the same notes on a piano, a guitar, a violin, whatever pretty much - unless you actually play instruments of eastern origin, which uses a different musical system]. [I\u2019ll go in alphabetical order]. A, A#/Bb, B, C, C#/Db, D, D#/Eb, E, F, F#/Gb, G, G#/Ab, A. So, as you can see, there are twelve different notes in the western music system. The distance between two notes is either called a tone or a semitone. It\u2019s called a tone if there\u2019s a note in between, but a semitone if not. Examples: From C to D is a tone, but from C to C# is a semitone. ",

            "answer_text": "Not quite 2. From G3 to G4 is one, then E5 is a 6th above G4. The G above E5 would be G5. There are 8 notes from one octave to the next, and the E is 6 notes above the G. That makes it one and three quarter octaves. ",
