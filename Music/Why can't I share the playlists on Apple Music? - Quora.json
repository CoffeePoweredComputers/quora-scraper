            "answer_text": "I searched the Apple community regarding this issue only to find the answers given not only unsatisfying, but also the ability to reply had been greyed out. I reworded my question in any number of ways and finally got a solution. If you have Apple Music, even the free trial, you can share your playlists. All you need to do is to mess with your iCloud Music settings. You can do this (as of November of 2018) by clicking on settings on your iPhone, click on Music, and under the Music settings turn on \u201ciCloud Music Library.\u201d At this point, after you have closed and reopened your Apple music application you should be able to get the \u201cShare playlist\u201d option after the playlists have reloaded. This will also enable the \u201cShow on my profile on search\u201d option with a switch that will appear when you click on \u201cedit\u201d after you have selected a playlist. I hope this helps, as it frustrated me as well. ",
