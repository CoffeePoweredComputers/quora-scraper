            "answer_text": "Yes, Lisa from Blackpink is severely underweight. Her BMI is much lower than what is considered 'healthy'. However, I don't think that it is concerning because other factors could be involved as to why she is this skinny. It could be because she has an insanely fast metabolism, which means that she can process fat and all sort of nutrition at a much faster rate than anyone else. It could also be because of an overactive thyroid, like EXID's Solji, but that is unlikely because she looks well. Her metabolism can gradually slow down with age, but at this age it is still super fast. She has an ectomorph body type which is why she has smaller bone structures than most people. Ectomorphs are also fat efficient, so again, they process fat much faster than endomorphs and mesomorphs would. Everyone has different body types, please appreciate they way we all look. Including Lisa. She is not sick.  ",

            "answer_text": "She's severely underweight\u2014not skinny! Skinny is on the lower side of normal weight range using BMI. Lisa's height is 5\u20327 and for a small frame woman, her weight range should be 56kg-62kg yet she's just about 46kg-48kg!!!! Some people defend her by saying she eats a lot compared to the other members but considering her height, their heavy dance practices, her metabolism, and her hyperness, she should be taking more to compensate and fill out her weight! YG should take care of their talents by making sure that their talents are healthy and fit! They should hire a nutritionist or something to monitor their diet (proper diet, not the one that talent agencies force their talents to go into to look super skinny). The sad thing is that, in KPOP and Hollywood, this kind of weight is 'desirable' so they don't do anything to correct it when in reality, most people see it as mere skin and bones. ",
