            "answer_text": "I am an audiophile and when I see this question there are so many songs that I can think of. I'll write a few lines from the songs I really like. Take me to Church by Andrew Bryne Hozier The lines which I like are: \u201cNo masters or kings when the ritual begins, there is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sins. In the madness and soil, of that sad earthly scene, Only then I am human, Only then I am clean.\u201d Illusions and dreams by Poets of the fall The lines which I like: \u201c Look in my eyes I'll make you see, we are drifting aimlessly, blind in a world of make belief.\u201d Summer Bummer by Lana Del Ray White lies and black beachesMiles in between usIs this love or lust or some game on repeat?It's like making me crazyTell me, \"have patience\"Baby, I need thisWhite lines and black beachesWhite lies and black beachesAnd blood red sangriasWe traveled for weeks, just to escape your demonsBut you've got your reasonsIn making me crazyBut you've got your reasonsWhite lies and black beaches Thinking out loud by Ed Sheeran When your legs don't work like they used to before, And I can't sweep you off of your feet, Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love? Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks? Someone new by Hozier There's an art to life's distractionsTo somehow escape the burning weightThe art of scraping throughSome like to imagineThe dark caress of someone else I guess any thrill will do. Would things be easierIf there was a right way? Honey there is no right way. Hoshwaalon ko khabar kya by Jagjit Singh Hum labon se keh na paayeUnse haal-e-dil kabhi Aur woh samjhi nahin yeKhamoshi kya cheez hai Translates to: My lips could never speak of the things that my heart felt, And she never understood what my silence meant. The list can go on and on. As I said, audiophile alert. ",

            "answer_text": "Depending on the mood we create our favorite song and also we switch to the songs which describes our situation. I'm an Indian and hence I love Bollywood songs. There are many songs but I'll discuss some of them Tere Naal Ishqa - from the movie ShivaayI feel that this song can be dedicated to anyone whether it is your mom, your friend or Best friend. Where Kailash Kher gave his voice to the lyrics. Then there is another song which describes the feeling of a girl for a guy she love Rozana - from the movie Naam ShabanaI love to listen this song and Shreya's voice. This song describes the feelings of a girl towards a guy she likes. Give me some sunshine - from the movie 3 idiotsI know everyone at some point in their life thinks about the same as this song's lyrics are. Kal Ho na ho - from the movie Kal Ho Na HoHow can one forget to mention this song? Even if you hate SRK but you can't hate this song. And you can't disagree with the lyrics too. This song has one of the best lyrics! And Sonu Nigam's voice will make you \u201cWow\u201d Besabriyan - from the movie MS Dhoni- the untold story.When it comes to motivation this song might help some people to move their ass to work.
