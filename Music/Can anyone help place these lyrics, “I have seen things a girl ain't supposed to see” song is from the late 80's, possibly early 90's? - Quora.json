I've Never Been To me lyrics If that\u2019s not the one you want, be advised that you can Google for the lyrics you remember. Put them inside quotes, and if you\u2019re not sure of any word(s), leave them out and break the line into multiple quoted pieces. For instance, if you felt that you weren\u2019t sure if the lyric above said \u201cwoman\u201d or \u201cgirl\u201d, nor how \u201cs\u2019posed\u201d were spelled (it might be the full word, \u201csupposed\u201d), you could Google it \u201ceither way\u201d by phrasing your search as: \u201cThat a\u201d \u201cain\u2019t\u201d \u201cposed to see\u201d Also, if you know the tune and can at least somewhat carry a tune, and you\u2019re on a device with a microphone (and really, what device today doesn\u2019t have a microphone?) \u2014 and the site is still up (I haven\u2019t looked lately) \u2014, you can try going to midomi.com where you can search for songs by \u2014 believe it or not \u2014 humming them into your computer or other device\u2019s microphone! :-o Good luck; hope this helps!
