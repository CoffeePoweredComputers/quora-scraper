            "answer_text": "One of the most difficult things for people to understand, is the relationship between the music, what that piece of music does for the musician when they turn it into lyrics, to express, put in context, the music you just created. In other words, the song is cylindrical between music and lyrics, each affecting the other. Yoko had just made a short poem about how we Imagine. It takes this idea from her, to be applied possibly through John Lennon\u2019s subconscious, to his playing about on the Piano. The Piano had taken over as the instrument to write songs from, because the guitar had become a trap for him to go into usual Chord Progressions, choice of Key, and melodic progressions. This is to avoid a massive problem most established musicians have, the tendency to make all your songs sounding the same. The Beatles production of a Song from whoever so ever created it, or even just a Song idea, is in my humble opinion, what made their songs so incredible. Firstly, \u201cFresh Ears\u201d are totally important, because the creator can get too used to the song, too close, too objectively see what is wrong, or if there are ways to make it better. During Sgt Peppers this Paul McCartney overdubbing, because he could pop in living next door, was eroding this process of inclusion. \u201cWell it\u2019s MY SONG, I\u2019ll decide\u201d, was exactly what George Harrison said to Eric Clapton to enlist his help on While My Guitar Gently Weeps. This territorial attitude developed, which was a stupid self-destruction of the ways that had made them successful. VERY STUPID. Firstly, the repeated three note Chord that is the heart of the Song, is NO CHORD! It is NOT anywhere in any Piano Chord Book. Obviously reading musicians say this is not true, and will go a million times around the houses, to prove it. What they don\u2019t prove, is WHY JOHN LENNON JUST DID IT! These educated idiots, are unable to write extortionary songs themselves, they are just smart arses about how it was done. John Lennon just put the little poem Yoko wrote, to the Metre (Beat and Timing), to this repeated Chord, with a Beat of Silence, a little Riff, to go back to the same Chord. It goes around and around, slowly building up to the breakout from this Repeated Pattern, to an increase of Tempo and Volume. Then John has got the music, the structure to make more of, plus that idea of what the Song is ALL about. Not bad for a musical genius, who says he knows nothing about music! As for the important meanings from the lyrics. In my head, John is saying, why argue, promote religion, a spiritual journey is possible if we don\u2019t fight over these issues. Just Imagine they didn\u2019t exist, so we cannot fight and kill each other over these issues, of Religion, Possessions, Materialism, and Nationality. He knows what people will say: \u201cJohn Lennon is a Dreamer, not in any reality\u201d, well he defeats that too, by inviting you to be a Dreamer too, and join him. The Music and Lyrics match perfectly, adding force to both. The Major = equals Happy Mood, and the Minor = equals Sad, is also defeated as always, as Imagine goes into more subtle thoughts and feelings. The Hall Mark of The Beatles is their ability to write a Sad Song with the sounds of Hope included, no better achieved than in this song Imagine. The meaning is very similar to Hey Jude, that life can BE great, even going through life\u2019s hardships. With Imagine, John Lennon is saying WE as people, are making these Hardships, why NOT invest in them? BE FREE OF THEM. Well, will we? ",

            "answer_text": "This song from John Lennon seemed to resonate with millions of people across the universe. I know that many consider Imagine his very best work, it has a simplicity and earnest power that cuts through obscurity, it presents I guess a spiritual perspective that is totally without any religious affiliation-and this baffles some. John Lennon was what we used to call a \u2018free thinker\u2019, this means that he assumed the right to build his own conclusions about life, society, politics. He certainly explored some spiritual movements, notably the Transcendental Meditation approach of a Guru of the day, but he wound up rejecting this as a way of life, taking from it some valuable insights. John Lennon was not a devotee of any religious movement, but he was certainly a spiritual person, an observer and thinker. The seeming ambiguity of a song that speaks of \u2018Peace, \u2018No Possessions\u2019very much in the Buddhist vein, but also he spoke of \u2018No Religion Too\u2019 creates cognitive dissonance in some people. He asked us to imagine a world where humanity accepted one another, where we renounce material gain, religious conflicts, war, and accepted that we all follow our own journey. On the surface, Imagine can come across as being almost a \u2018Kumbyah\u2019 anthem, a hippy-dippy peace/love/understanding type song, it is very much more than this, in my opinion. To our cynical eyes & ears in 2018, Imagine can look and sound a little trite. For me, the song explores some very ancient ideas. These ideas are old, but perennial because they point to a possible ideal for humanity. Just imagine, Lennon asks us, if everyone decided to simply stop being hostile, stopped striving to force one another to think a certain way, to believe certain things, and to simply \u2018Be\u2019. Like all ideals, it is open to derision, accusations of naivety, simplistic thinking; this is why the song is called \u2018Imagine\u2019, just for one minute, John Lennon asks us, allow these ideas to actually take form in your mind. The simple piano music, with that recurring theme supports the quiet simplicity and frank expression of the ideas. Among all of the people who keep striving to push others down, to compete, to displace, to build their vision of what the world should be there is a growing number each generation of people who want none of this, who are working towards peace, acceptance, living in harmony. \u201cYou may say I am a dreamer, but I\u2019m not the only one, I hope one day you will join us, and the world will live as one.\u201d John is speaking to this group, who can hear him, and those who maybe are moving towards this, and hoping you will join us. It is a dream, an imagined wonderful potential. ",

            "answer_text": "\"Imagine\" is a song about communism since John Lennon described it as \"virtually the Communist Manifesto\" when it was released. In general, communism advocates the absence of class divisions within a community. Nonetheless, communism is an umbrella term which encompasses various categories under the branch. For instance, Marxism, Maoism, Leninism, et cetera. Among all the subcategories under communism, I firmly believe that Leninism fit in the context of \"imagine.\" Leninism falls under communism, which was the official state ideology of the parties of the Communist International in the Soviet Union (USSR). The purpose behind Leninism is to achieve a revolutionary transformation of the capitalist state into a proletariat-led state. John Lennon had indulged himself into the writing of the song since the early 1970s when capitalist ideologies started to emerge. Therefore, components of communism are expressed in a mild and obscure way to avoid direct clashes with the rival school of thoughts. In \"Imagine there's no heaven\" and \"No hell below us,\" John used insinuation to introduce the idea of Marxist-Leninism. With \"Heaven\" and \"hell\" representing the affluent class and grass-root class, respectively, it shows the presence of a hierarchy in the society. As John called upon his fellow to \"imagine\" a situation without the division of \"heaven\" and \"hell,\" it eventually means the most idealistic society is a society without hierarchy and class struggles. Marxist-Leninism also advocates shared property within society. This idea has embedded in lyrics like \"Imagine no possessions,\" \"no need for greed or hunger.\" In these two lines, John used euphemism to omit the origin of \"possessions,\" \"greed\" and \"hunger\" and left a blank space for publics to reflect, not only on capitalism but also themselves. Back in the days in the military, my fellows and I always played this song and sang it next to the majestic Laptev Sea. Although we came from different families, we shared the same blood, values, and properties. I believe this is \"the brotherhood of man.\" ",

            "answer_text": "Imagine is a profane song about atheism and agnosticism. Imagine there is no Heaven No hell below us Above us only sky Imagine all the people living life in peace You may say I am a dreamer But I am not the only one: these words are manipulation, deception, deceit and lies. Who is \u201cus\u201d? Who is \u2018all the people\u2019? Does this \u2018one person\u2019 speak for all humanity? This person is narcissistic. He is attempt to invent his own world. He is acting as a magician making the LORD GOD to vanish from His creation. He is attempting to annul and make void the creation of the LORD GOD. He would remake himself the new god. Does these words describe the invention of a new world by another man from the past who has attempted to remake heaven and earth in his image? ...The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, thus saith the LORD GOD; Because thine heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a (G)od (and a Lord), I sit in the seat of GOD, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art a man, and not god, though thou set thine heart as the heart of GOD: Behold, thou art wiser (?) than Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from thee: with thy wisdom (?) and thine understanding (?) thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures: by thy great wisdom and by thy traffick has thou increased thy riches: and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches: therefore thus saith the LORD GOD; because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of GOD; behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations: and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom(?), and they shall defile thy brightness. They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas. Wilt thou yet say before Him that slayeth thee, I am (G)od? but thou shalt be a man, and no God, in the hand of Him that slayeth thee. Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised (self-righteous) by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the LORD GOD... ...I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies, saying, I have dreamed a dream. How long shall this been in the heart of the (false) prophets that prophesy lies? yea, they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart; why think to cause My people to forget My name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten My name for Baal. The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath My word, let him speak My word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat?... If there is no Heaven and no Hell, what will happen to all creation? The wicked and the good will be locked in combat for all eternity. The LORD GOD will not be spiritually living. The earth would be a world of continuous existence and continuous survival. The existence of man will be futility and emptiness. Man will not be fruitful and multiply. If man could be fruitful and multiply, he would overpopulated the earth, and there would be no death. He would have a body, mind and heart (if any). He would have no soul. He would be lest than human. He would be robotic. He would not feel love and hate. He would have no humanity. He would no know respect and dignity. He would not have spiritual knowledge, spiritual wisdom, spiritual reasoning and spiritual understanding. There would be no end to suffering, disease and wickedness. Man would have no healer. There would be cleanliness for the stench and filth of man, What else can be imagined? Civilisation is the untamable beast. Man has no power and no authority over it. It offers no honour and no glory. It raises no hand in victory and reward. It does not recognise and benefit from intellectual struggles and personal celebrations. It will curse wealth, status, rank, class and race. His vain imagination will always tell him that there are preventable strategies to usher peace and goodwill. The nature of thought of man is to never surrender to peace and goodwill. Every disaster that he attempts to control by his words, his acts, his ways and his works will be vanity and futility. ... Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they make you vain; they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the LORD. They say still unto them that despise Me, The LORD hath said, Ye shall have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come unto you. For who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD, and hath perceived and heard His word? who hath marked His word, and heard it? Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked (the chaff which the wind driveth away)... \u2026If He (the LORD) set His heart upon man, If He gather unto Himself His Spirit and His breath; all flesh shall perish together, and man shall return to dust. If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken unto my words. Shall even he that hateth right (righteousness) govern? And will thou condemn Him (the LORD GOD) that is most just? Is it fit to say to a (divine) king, Thou art wicked? And to princes, Ye are ungodly? How much less to Him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? For they are all the work of His hands... ",

John Lennon correctly used the word \u201cimagine\u201d as a transitive verb. With number 1: to form a mental image of (something not present). His way to describe his idea of Imagine: Imagine there\u2019s no heaven, it\u2019s easy if you try, no hell below us, above us only sky. So to effectively analyze this simple sentence, the author is asking his audience to \u201cimagine\u201d by forming this mental image of what would it be like if we imagined there\u2019s no heaven, or hell. Whether or not if every person on the earth believes if there is a heaven or hell doesn\u2019t matter, what matters is let\u2019s all just draw up a mental picture of what it would be like if there was no such place as either one. \u201dImagine\u201d is about envisioning a world without any strife or friction, by not separating people by what religion they are, and if they believe in heaven or hell. Or whether they are rich or poor, \u201cImagine no possessions, it\u2019s easy if you try.\u201d The key word here is to \u201cenvision\u201d it. What many people get confused is when the author says no heaven, no hell, no countries, and no possessions. They have bleeped out the key word: Imagine. Imagining it and realizing it are two different things. They are polar opposites of one another. So when he tells us to \u201cImagine\u201d the things that he mentions, what he does mean is that these things are not real, just an image. That is what \u201cImagine\u201d is about.

Dylan was known for his deep meanings and had several that at least are as good as if not better than Imagine like Blowing In The Wind or Like A Rolling stone. Even many McCartney songs had a great message. The last song the Beatles released was Long and Winding Road and the message there was profound for me. Many always looked at John as the best at writing lyrics but Paul also wrote some great lyrics as well. I will say that John did write a great song that provokes thought in Imagine. The long and winding roadThat leads to your doorWill never disappearI've seen that road beforeIt always leads me hereLead me to your door The wild and windy nightThat the rain washed awayHas left a pool of tearsCrying for the dayWhy leave me standing hereLet me know the way Many times I've been aloneAnd many times I've criedAny way you'll never knowThe many ways I've tried But still they lead me backTo the long winding roadYou left me standing hereA long long time agoDon't leave me waiting hereLead me to your door But still they lead me backTo the long winding roadYou left me standing hereA long long time agoDon't keep me waiting here Lead me to your doorYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ",

It\u2019s a very simple song about how if there was no god things would be better, That\u2019s it. If you think John Lennon is the symbol of peace among musicians, think again. He was a shallow thinker, and he thought he was super deep, when all of his songs were simple. In fact, there is nothing peaceful about him. If most people read up on the things he did, they\u2019d be disgusted. I don\u2019t believe in good and bad people/actions, but if I were to believe in good and bad, I\u2019d say that John Lennon is a violent, abusive, self pitying, pessimistic, monster. But because he sang about peace, most people just assume he was a good hearted man. They couldn't be anymore wrong. People are too trusting. and for the young kids out here, XXXTENTACION is just like john Lennon, a violent, abusive, narcissistic, superficially \u201cdeep\u201d, monster. though his music is really good. I don\u2019t want to make it sound like I don\u2019t like these two guys, honestly I don\u2019t give a fuck about the things they did. I also don\u2019t want to make these guys perceived as un-artistic, they re both incredible artists, they're just not \u201cdeep\u201d. But god i hate hippies\u2026. anyways I\u2019m done ranting. If you want a song that\u2019s actually deep, listen to Pink Floyd, and in my mind there deepest song is this. It deals with themes of society, but doesn't tell you that right away, you have to find it. It\u2019s a song which deals with the average civilian, and how our societal influences are digging a deeper and deeper mindset of a dog eat dog society, and shows that that not only have been thinking more self interested, but that the worse our environment gets, then the more selfish the people become. They become animals, dogs who fight over scraps and tear each other to pieces. Pink Floyd may not be the band for everyone, but if you want something deep, theres nothing better than this  ",

Mankind can create his own utopia here on earth, without God. 2. There is no such thing as sin. People only do bad things because of their environment. 3. Because there is no sin, there is no need for repentance or redemption. Human perfection can be attained through human effort. 4. Private property, morality, the nation-state, & national borders are all obsolete relics of humanity\u2019s earlier stages of development. Those things must be abolished to make way for the next leap forward. 5. Humanity is about to make a quantum leap towards perfection. The only thing holding us back from that quantum leap is the obsolete belief systems that many still hold, especially Christianity. Those belief systems must be replaced with a human-centered spirituality, in which mankind is his own god and the author of his own morality. ",

Sorry, but no, I decidedly do not agree that Imagine is a great song with deep meaning. I think it\u2019s an okay song that displays naive idealism. Anyone who thinks no countries and no religion would mean \u201cnothing to kill or die for\u201d has got a lot of growing up and wising up to do. It\u2019s very sad that John never got the opportunity to grow out of this naive idealistic phase. He was a very thoughtful person, so I have to believe that if he had lived, he would have realized that humans are far too creative at finding reasons to hate each other to let the abolishment of a few institutions change that. In fact, I do not even consider Imagine to be one of the best naively idealistic songs of the 60\u2019s -70\u2019s let alone among the best songs of all time. I think that honor goes to Dylan for Chimes of Freedom: Far between sundown's finish an' midnight's broken tollWe ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashingAs majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the soundsSeeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fightFlashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flightAn' for each an' ev'ry underdog soldier in the nightAn' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watchedWith faces hidden as the walls were tighteningAs the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rainDissolved into the bells of the lightning Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rakeTolling for the luckless, the abandoned an' forsakenedTolling for the outcast, burnin' constantly at stakeAn' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hailThe sky cracked its poems in naked wonderThat the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breezeLeaving only bells of lightning and its thunder Striking for the gentle, striking for the kindStriking for the guardians and protectors of the mindAn' the poet and the painter far behind his rightful timeAn' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing In the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled talesFor the disrobed faceless forms of no positionTolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughtsAll down in taken-for-granted situations Tolling for the deaf an' blind, tolling for the muteFor the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostituteFor the misdemeanor outlaw, chaineded an' cheated by pursuitAn' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flaredAn' the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly liftingElectric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the onesCondemned to drift or else be kept from drifting Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trailFor the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a taleAn' for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jailAn' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing Starry-eyed an' laughing as I recall when we were caughtTrapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspendedAs we listened one last time an' we watched with one last lookSpellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling ended Tolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursedFor the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worseAn' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universeAn' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing Songwriters: Bob Dylan  ",

Notwithstanding, \"Imagine\" is the only song that I have resonated the most. Also, different people may perceive the lyrics with a different lens as everybody has their own story behind the scenes. Therefore, I genuinely agree with every analysis and here is another insight from a sexual minority :)) To give you a bit of myself before I kickstart my views on the lyrics. I come from India and am a high school teacher in an international school in Singapore surrounded by the vitality of teenagers and the open culture of Singapore. However, I was born in a conservative Indian family in which most of the traditional customs and values like Thimithi and Lathmar Holi of Uttar Pradesh, remain in my family. Growing up, I have been indoctrinating with ideas like men are superior to women, and marriage is contracted as \"man and woman.\" Four years ago, I officially came out as a lesbian. As expected, my parents consider this as malformed values and bite my head off. It was a significant knock on my identity. To me, \"Imagine\" is a song that promotes LGBT rights. In the third verse, \"imagine there are no countries,\" John adopted analogy to represent \"countries\" as different value judgments on the sexual minorities as there are vast customs, notion, and tradition in a country, which contribute to the formation of value judgment.

If we spent what the world spends on war and weapons on feeding everyone, providing fresh water, shelter, basic necessities, clothes, healthcare etc. Research for medical reasons. Space exploration and technology, education, and of course music and on and on\u2026. How much better humanity would be! Imagine what the world would be like. Pollution, disease, poverty etc are enough to fight, we don't need to fight each other. Imagine peace and love. ",

            "answer_text": "Per Wikipedia:  In a 1980 interview with David Sheff for Playboy magazine, Lennon remarks on the message of \"Imagine\":  Sheff: On a new album, you close with \"Hard Times Are Over (For a While)\". Why?  Lennon: It's not a new message: \"Give Peace a Chance\" \u2014 we're not being unreasonable. Just saying \"give it a chance.\" With \"Imagine\" we're asking, \"can you imagine a world without countries or religions?\" It's the same message over and over. And it's positive.  Ono indicated that the lyrical content of \"Imagine\" was \"just what John believed \u2014 that we are all one country, one world, one people. He wanted to get that idea out.\" In addition, the content of \"Imagine\" was inspiration for the concept of Nutopia: The Country of Peace, created in 1973. Lennon included a symbolically mute \"anthem\" to this country on his album Mind Games. Also, inspiration for Yoko's Imagine Peace Tower in Iceland came from words in the second verse: Imagine all the people living life in peace.  In the book Lennon in America, by Geoffrey Giuliano, Lennon commented that Imagine was an \"anti-religious, anti-nationalistic, anti-conventional, anti-capitalistic [song], but because it's sugar-coated, it's accepted.\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine_(song) ",

There are ideas borrowed from Buddhism (living for today), some aboriginal beliefs (no one possesses the land) and other well-known spiritual or philosophical stances. Without nationalistic fervor, fundamentalist religions and out of control greed (all of which characterize much of the world at large) there would be far fewer reasons for us to kill each other and steal from each other. It is one sort of utopian vision, and John hopes we can hold up some of these dream-like ideas as ideals. I think it\u2019s all clearly stated in the song. I also think the more cynical comments here result from ignorance - lack of exposure to other thought systems. The modern materialistic, competitive world view isn\u2019t the be-all-and-end-all. Ummm, actually it could be the end-all. ",

I don\u2019t push my views on them and they don\u2019t push them on me. I have many friends who have money. I am poor. They don\u2019t flaunt their lifestyle under my nose or make me feel bad. They\u2019re my friends and accept me for who I am. That is what Lennon\u2019s song is about. Acceptance. Take away all the reasons we fight with each other and suddenly we all become equal. We are all humans. We all bleed red and there should be no reason why we can\u2019t all love and respect one another. ",

John Lennon, like all humans, was a conflicted man. He loved deeply at the same time he exhibited a dark inability to care for people he should have easily loved. He was both a genuinely good man and a dark, cold asshole. His masterful song IMAGINE was written during and after a time of tremendous conflict: The late 1960s, when breaking old codes of \u2018decency' reigned. Women's rights, civil rights, Vietnam, police beating people in the streets, tear gas blowing through the trees, weed, hard drugs, marching for FREEDOM. Like all humans, Lennon was flawed. But his message via IMAGINE was a dip into genius. Dissect it relentlessly or just listen and weep. His meanings were/are not ambiguous - he meant to say precisely what he did say\u2026 \u201c some say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one. I hope one day you will join us, and the world can live as One.\u201d If we have the capacity to be touched or moved by that extraordinary song, we have the capacity to work toward its goal of Peace. IMAGINE what that would be.. ",

This song is ironic in that it describes hope in abandoning religion that brings hope to millions living on this planet, it is ironic as it sounds like a religious hymn but it is anti religious. Even though most people would agree that hoping for world peace is a good thingthis song is both hateful and naive in that it accuses religions for all the wars and hatred in the world and ignores the real reasons: Greed for power, wealth and territory.  Good religions of this world like Christianity, Buddhism and Hinduism each teachthat greed has evil consquences and show ways to overcome it if person is willing to evolve spiritually. In ignoring and denying this positive spiritual contribution good religions have made to humanity this song can be seen as nihilist. ",
