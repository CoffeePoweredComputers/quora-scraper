            "answer_text": "There used to be: Rania\u2019s Alex Reid   Essentially her story is that she was, I believe an independent artist in America and was approached by DR Music, Rania\u2019s company first and invited to Korea. She didn\u2019t audition or go to Korea with the intention of being a Kpop idol. DR Music themselves are a hot mess of a company who can barely manage this failing group (who makes awesome music btw) they essentially brought Alex in as a prop to bring more attention to the group. Because nothing sticks out more than \u201chey! We have an African-american girl in the group!\u201d And it did bring the group attention. But the company treated her poorly and unfairly. They never trained her, kept her out of most promotions /schedules, and even kept her out of her debut MV with them. There was maybe 1 or 2 comebacks where they actually included her in the choreography, other times, they\u2019d have her stay offstage, walk up perform her rap, then walk off. The company would always come up with some excuse as to why she was absent, saying something like she had a opportunity she couldn\u2019t pass up which always ended up being nothing. She even said she didn\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t call her back for comeback preparations even when she asked them. She said her members, because of communication issues, they weren\u2019t able to get close. She also said that there were times where she felt a disconnect between her and the rest of the group and some of them were standoffish, but because she came in so suddenly and then overnight, made headline news for being a black idol while they have been training together for years for a chance at the spotlight, she kind of understands why the girls may have felt that way. Plus she was constantly kept out of the loop for everything that she didn\u2019t even know when members of the group just up and left. People in the industry in general seemed to have treated her fine and other groups were generally nice to her. But she did say that out in the public, there were instances of racism, like she got kicked out of a cab once even though she was speaking Korean to the driver. Anyways, she managed to stay in the group for about 2 years (which TBH is pretty long for a Rania member) but she eventually left in 2017. ",
