            "answer_text": "What kind of megaphone? A \"natural\" megaphone doesn't amplify sound, it makes it more directional. So it is louder only in the direction that you aim it. It can be as simple as a truncated cone, or a horn shape. Usually, no one bothers with the greater expense of a trumpet shape because they want something cheap if they are using a natural megaphone. Thanks to Greenbiz dot com for the image:  This is also how those horns that you set your smartphone into to \"amplify\" the sound work. Both by matching the speaker better to the impedance of free air, and directing the sound mostly in one direction. Thanks to AestheticPost dot com for the image:  An amplified megaphone has a microphone at the mouth end that converts sound pressure waves into an electrical signal. Then an electronic circuit amplifies the electrical signal to much higher power. That powerful electrical signal is then fed into a speaker, which changes it back into sound pressure waves. Then a horn on the speaker both matches the impedance to the air's free space impedance, and makes it directional so most of the sound goes out the front. That thing you see sticking out the center of the megaphone is part of a structure called a folded horn. Otherwise, a megaphone would need to be about 2 to 3 times as long.

            "answer_text": "A megaphone (literally \u201cbig sound\u201d) is a hard surface with a small opening at one end, a large opening at the other end and a straight wall (cone) or smooth curve in between. It does not amplify the sound - there is no added energy. It changes the interface physics for sound by geometry to increase the efficiency of the transmission path from one voice to a crowd. Sound energy transfer depends on the pressure, particle velocity, surface area and acoustic impedance. Enclosed volumes like human vocal tract have high acoustic impedance, and free space has a low acoustic impedance so there is a big loss in efficiency at the mouth. The megaphone acts as an acoustic transformer. The gradual transition from high acoustic impedance matching the vocal tract to lower acoustic impedance at the larger megaphone mouth increases the efficiency by the ratio of the entry to the exit. The larger mouth also changes the geometry of the wave propagation. The angle of propagation depends on the ratio of diameter to wavelength, so the megaphone narrows the beam. With the same energy concentrated in a smaller space, it is louder still. Both of these effects vary widely with frequency. They are almost non-existent for bass so they make voices sound thin by selectively increasing the treble. Even higher female voices will benefit from a subwoofer, which is the opposite effect of a megaphone. The tight beam at highest vocal frequencies means that off-axis sound from megaphones is mostly midrange, the \u201cDonald Duck\u201d effect. This is excerbated in electronic megaphones by compression circuits and clipping distortion. ",
