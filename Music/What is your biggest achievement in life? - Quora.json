            "answer_text": "Being a good wife and a good mother. Those are the highest achievements I have and hope to continue. I have been told by numerous individuals including my husband that I am a good wife and a good mother. I send my daughter to the best private school possible and I would love to send my stepchildren there but that is not up to me it is up to my husband\u2019s ex-wife and she does not agree. I spend time with my child every day and we are extremely open. I have taught her from age 6 that if she makes a mistake and she comes to me first she will not get in trouble the first time. If it happens again, and she tells me first, she will be in less trouble. She is extremely comfortable talking with me about her body changes as well as boys. She is only 11 but I hope this will continue throughout her life. She has openly said that she likes to talk to me about these things because she knows I will not talk to anyone else and she cannot count on the children at her school to keep the secrets. As far as being a wife, I am constantly asking my husband what I can do to improve. I make sure to satisfy every need he has. There is nothing too small that he could request for me to do. He provides for our family the most. He is a wonderful man so I strive to be a wonderful wife. We have great communication and I choose not to be a nagging wife and I don\u2019t constantly bring up the past. If I ask him to do something and he doesn\u2019t I do not get angry. Marriage isn\u2019t about who goes to the grocery store. We fight rarely and when we do we are able to fix it within a matter of minutes because we stop what we are doing and communicate. I refuse to be a wife that nags or complains when he is not abusive or a liar. I encourage all who are married to ask their partners what they could do to improve their marriage. You\u2019d be surprised on the answers and how simple it could be. ",

            "answer_text": "Erik was born gorgeous. At sixteen, Erik had long blonde hair, a smile that could melt the coldest of hearts and a body the Gods were jealous of. Erik represents perfection in my eyes.  My brother Erik and I were raised by a single mom, our Mom. My Mom has four sisters and countless female cousins. That gave Erik and I a very deep appreciation for the challenges all single parents face. Erik is my only sibling and younger brother by two years and nine months. At forty years old the small age gap no longer matters. At eleven years old it made all the difference in the world.  Born into dysfunction and raised by a parent who struggled with addiction, we found ourselves exposed to adult problems, often. Mom's boyfriends were what we swore we'd never become. The first time we fought back, Erik was nine. Garrett took a shot at Mom in our kitchen. I was next on the hit list and fell easily. Before he could raise his hand the third time, Erik charged from the back door straight towards him. My kid brother lifted a six foot man, that I thought was going to kill me, up into the air and launched him through two pantry doors. That would be a turning point in the lives of two brothers. One by one, in short order, we would take Mom's boyfriends out and keep her single for years. If my instigation and manipulation wasn't enough to chase them away, Erik used brute force. We were a formidable team. Our blood ties and history made our relationship strong, unbreakable. Throughout our teens and twenties we did everything together. Every job we worked was together. We lived together and dated sisters together. We thought our way through troubles and when that didn't work, well, brute force did.  Yes, Erik is a holding a monkey!  Erik was and is the man I most admire. He is part of me and we are part of each other. We started shooting dope together somewhere in our twenties. Two or three years ago, we were both trying to kick. I invited him over to my apartment one afternoon to plan a birthday party for our Mom. We talked, had a nice dinner and just caught up. Trying to kick dope and kicking dope are different. Trying means we were still shooting, but knew it wouldn't last forever. We cop'd a few bags and made arrangements for him to stay the night. We each shot a bag and I watched as the life drained from his face. His bright beautiful smile slowly fell as he slumped forward. I knew what was happening. At that point I had plenty of experience with death. I didn't panic in the sense that I was frozen, but I was certainly scared. I checked for a pulse that I knew wasn't going to be there. I called 911 immediately and began CPR. It was almost ten minutes until rescue personal would arrive. When I was relieved by med-techs, I broke down in tears. Erik was taken to Pottstown Memorial Hospital and I was right there with him. After about six hours, Erik came to. He knew he had overdosed in my apartment. Erik never shot up again. I was and am so proud of him. The police interviewed him while he was in the hospital and told him what had happened, that I had saved his life. Last year I quit shooting dope and we finally talked about what happened that night. I told him that saving his life was the best thing I ever did. He slowly cracked that beautiful smile, the one he has me to thank for, and said, \u201cI kicked Garrett\u2019s ass when he tried to kill you, guess we\u2019re finally even.\u201d I couldn't believe it! My little brother still putting my ass in check. Leon ",

            "answer_text": "Getting past the awkward hump that came after going 100% all in on my dreams. For three months, I was in a seriously unenjoyable funk. I had quit my job, sold all of my stuff and was backpacking the world. Yet I wasn\u2019t happy. I was drowning in self doubt and overcome by feelings of failure, disappointment and confusion. For ninety days, I could not figure myself out. Because I had traveled to ten countries, met new people from all over the world and experienced an entirely new lifestyle-I was no longer the person I was when I first embarked on this journey. I wasn\u2019t the me that I knew. I had outgrown her. I also wasn\u2019t the person that I thought I would be. I wasn't a notable online writer, I wasn\u2019t making money and I wasn\u2019t happy. Feeling lost in your own skin is an interesting feeling. It\u2019s like being in your home but none of your stuff is there. You realize that it\u2019s just walls and windows, wood and shingles. The foundation is there, but everything inside is gone. There\u2019s no where to sit. No telephone to call anybody. It feels extremely lonely. I sat in this empty home, within myself, for three months. It took ninety whole day for me to realize that was happening was exactly what I had been wishing for. My life was changing. Everything had been taken out of my home because it no longer belonged there. My life had upgraded and I didn\u2019t need to bring all of the old furniture with me. The walls were bare so that I would be able to hang anything new that I wanted. The rooms were empty so that I could hand pick what my new sofa was going to look like. The emptiness was an opportunity. Change was going to refill my \u201chome\u201d with new treasures. I was growing up and transitioning into a new phase of my life where I was going to need new skills, personality traits and perspectives to succeed. I went from feeling incredibly lost and quite sad to liberated and passionate. I was reawakened to the opportunity that is life. My greatest achievement has been to open my eyes to the beauty of change. I\u2019m now being incredibly specific as to what I\u2019ll allow into my new home. That awkward hump, while feeling like some of the worst months of my life, was one of the best predicaments that could have happened to me. It reminded me why everybody doesn\u2019t end up going for their dreams, because it\u2019s mentally exhausting. It showed me that I was strong enough to attain the lifestyle of my dreams, because each tough situation is an epiphany waiting to be discovered. I am grateful for the awkward hump and those painful few months. I am ready for the incredible opportunities that will come from pushing past tough times and continuing to go all in on my goals. The day I had this epiphany.  Eva Gutierrez on Instagram ",

            "answer_text": "Growing up, I've always dreamed about walking with both my feet on the ground. Normally. I was born too early, by 7 months. I have autism and cerebral palsy, but I've beaten my cerebral palsy and I don't mind for my hand. I don't mind my autism, I just sometimes forget things, not that often or don't understand things immediately, not that often too. Only once in 5 months or so. My veins, blue lines running through my body basically, were a little shorter than usual in my right leg. That caused me to walk on my toes for my right leg. I was unable to get the heel to the ground. So with my left leg, I walked normally and fully on the ground, while with my right leg, I just walked on my toes of that foot. At school, kids realising this would always ask me why I was walking like this. I would reply in just a short answer; I was born like this. I've gone through many pain of useless casts and leg braces and even one or two botox injections to get it to the ground, without any benefit. Doctors thought the only solution to this was an operation, but my parents just couldn't make it happen. So in 2016 when I was 10, we visited Turkey in summer break to visit my father's family living there. We also took some of the time to visit a doctor there. The doctor in Turkey said, ameliyat \u015farttir. An operation is a favor. So, 2 years later in 2018, I finally got operated. When I woke up, I felt my right leg was heavy feeling. When I got back to my room, I lifted up the blanket, and found a tight pink cast wrapped around my leg. I didn't expect that, they didn't tell me they were gonna wrap a cast around afterwards. The nurse said they had done this to keep the extended veins in place for about a month. Just to make sure I was gonna walk on my heel. I was in a wheelchair for about a month or two, after I started learning to walk with those sticks. And eventually with one. Then I had to wear leg braces and get used to them again. I wore them in my childhood as well, this is the first time in years . I haven't been to school for a long while, and I couldn't eat for a few days after getting home even. I was too devastated about the pain i felt. I couldn't sleep, I had to sleep on the couch downstairs, and later on on my matras my mother had brought for me downstairs. Week by week, the pain was slowly reducing by one percent in my thoughts. I cried a lot, but deep down I was more than strong to handle this. These weren't tears of weakness. Secretly, these were plenty tears of joy. My cast was removed, but because of this day I had missed my first meeting event as I call it on my new school. I also had to stay in a therapy place to take therapy. I just was too afraid to walk after I tried walking with my therapist. My heel hurt intense. I thought I would never walk again until everyone forced me to. I again handled it. And finished my last few weeks in elementary school while I was in my wheelchair..successfully, I'd say when I was 11. My first few weeks of middle school were okay. I already memorized everyone's names in my class. Although I was still staying at my therapy place for therapy, I was fine. But one nurse there was teribble. But again, I handled it with every single thing I went through and today, I can walk with no pain, both feet on the ground, many friends made, just one leg brace left, back home, back to normal life with my biggest achievement growing up. My dream, biggest dream, biggest achievement, and only wish in life came true. Thanks to Allah, time and the doctors. I have nothing else I'd want in my life, I'm so grateful. All I've ever wanted is to walk normally and for this operation to take place. Time and Allah shall guide us all to our dreams. I've always been strong to pain, you should be too! I can defeat any kind. ",

            "answer_text": "For a second ,just stop and take a quick glance around , what do you see ? You see people ,in a rush ,in chaos ,in a hurry ,in a chase for nothing specific but anything which would help them grab attention from everyone , that being said I find myself on a whole different level then others , for me the biggest achievement means nothing but having a sense of satisfaction by developing my personality and skill set which would give me a better sense of understanding of everything around . So why do I or we need this ? Because I have observed that the people nowadays are more concerned and are constantly under pressure to impress others and figuring out what did they lack in the first place which doesn't makes anyone notice them. And to be honest though ,this is something of an inferiority complex , which people nowadays are infected with , YOU don't need to impress anyone for the sack of attention which might last a couple of seconds or for a word of praise which apparently is of no good use and probably sugar coated. Learn something new , widen your vision of the world , interact with the people around who posses good knowledge and can give you a wise counsel when you need . Do not reveal yourself fully to anyone , don't disclose your innermost secrets to others , let there be a mystery around you , let there be an altar between you and the people , this would get respect ,a dignity which you are worthy of , a sense of accomplishment which towards which you worked hard. Never put efforts to make other people notice you , strive hard to improve yourselves and everyone will come after you . So before I rest my words i can conclude what was the biggest achievement for me , To earn a place in the society which made a mark on everyone because of my honest efforts and a life guided by non compromisable principles which makes the best out of me in every situation.

            "answer_text": "It may seem like nothing to other people who don't know me. But this July, an almost 10 year lasting dream finally came true: I got my driver's licence, and bought my dream car, a brand new Seat Ibiza. I started applying for my dl in 2008, at the age of 20. Even though the theory lessons at the driving school were pretty good and I've learned a lot, I failed the theoretical test three times. Driving lessons were ok, but even after the 18 mandatory lessons, I still didn't feel confident to pass the main test. The third - and also most important - factor was the money. Taking the driver's licence in Austria is pretty expensive, with all the mandatory lessons, the first aid course, the examination fees and so on, the overall costs could stack up to 2000\u20ac. Since I failed the tests multiple times, and also had to take much more driving lessons than the mandatory amount, my savings got less and less and I feared that there soon won't be any money left. The final nail in the coffin was the fact that in early 2009, I moved out of my parent's house and in to my very own flat. All the furniture and household gadgets cost waaay more money than I expected/calculated, so I had to decide wether to spend my life in an empty flat but could drive a car by law, or I would buy more stuff for the flat but stopped driving school entirely. I went with the latter, as you can imagine. Over the last ten years, I mostly didn't miss my licence. Public transportation is excellent in Vienna, and you always find a relatively fast connection from A to B. But there were couple of times where the lack of a driver's licence got me into trouble. My ex-girlfriend was very reliant on her car. She hated the public transport and tried to avoid it at all costs, making her the complete opposite of myself, who had no real alternative but to go by bus/train. Long holiday trips or late night parties were always a reason for heated arguments, since she ALWAYS had to drive the car no matter what. Then all of a sudden, my ex-girlfriend left me in late 2017. What was first an absolute nightmare, turned into something really great for me; Since we had to give up our joint flat, she and I received a good amount of money from the fixtures and fittings of the new tenant. So, there I was, single and with a heck of a lot of money to spare. I decided to overcome my old fears, and applied for the licence - again. During that time, I met my new girlfriend, who also happened to take her driver's licence at the same time. This encouraged me even more, and after just shy of 4 months, I finally got my licence. Long story short, The very moment the examiner said the words \u201calright, you passed the test. Here's your temporary driver's licence\u201d really felt like a dream come true. My eyes filled with water, and I felt a sudden relieve. Even though I\u2019d repeatedly told myself over the last ten years \u201cyou really don't need the licence here in Vienna\u201d, it always felt like something was missing. A few weeks later, I went to a local Seat distributor and got my very first car - a Seat Ibiza. Getting into the car and starting it for the very first time was yet another dream come true moment, since I wanted to own an Ibiza for as long as I can imagine. ",

            "answer_text": "Happy New Year! As human beings, achievements are everything in today\u2019s world. It is the single most definitive subject that evaluates our worth, directly or indirectly. But what we fail to realize is that we achieve subtle things even without realizing the same. Making your loved ones\u2019 day a tad better, putting a smile on your parent\u2019s face, pampering them with gifts, making your friends laugh are some of the many examples of the same. Achievements, according to me can be classified as- Personal (which includes families, friends, loved ones, relatives)Academic (School and College/University)Work and experience (Internships and what not!)Hobbies and extra-curricular activitiesSince childhood, I have had an obsession with collecting certificates. Some of them are- School and College level (First one!)         2. Internships        3. Creative and Content Writing            4. But none of these even come close to- i. The time when I gifted my Mother a Book, saris, earrings and a watch from my earnings as a content writer. (I have been doing freelance writing for the past 6+ years since I was in class 12) ii. The time when I gifted my father a watch, some nice shirts from the same earnings as a content writer. iii. The time when I gifted my close relatives something of their choice after I secured my first job. (The gifts were not so expensive, but from the expressions on their faces, I could say they were happy. That is all that matters!) iv. The time when I gifted my grandmother a sari. She smiled sweetly through her gums and disappearing teeth and gave me a kiss. I\u2019ll cherish that moment forever! v. The time when I gifted a few of the house-helpers, who have been helping with domestic work since I was a baby, saris. They were overjoyed! In the end, it all boils down to the persons whom you care about the most. Because if they aren\u2019t present, you will not get any joy out of accomplishing something. Cheers! ~Biswadeep ",

There\u2019s an irony to my other answer \u2014 the thing that I think of as my greatest achievement isn\u2019t visible anywhere\u2026 it doesn\u2019t show up in my bank account or on the Internet, there\u2019s no monument or blazing Broadway lights or applause of the crowd associated with this achievement, nobody stands back in awe when I enter the room, preceded by my reputation. In a sense, I am the only person who knows that anything was achieved or understands what the achievement is or what it meant. So that\u2019s the kind of achievement that makes people roll their eyes and hold up an \u201cL\u201d between thumb and forefinger. The achievement is just this: I am able to be myself, with reasonable reliability. It\u2019s not 100% \u201csolved\u201d, it\u2019s more like a camera that goes in and out of focus a lot, but most of the time, the focus is pretty good. So that might not seem like much, but being a slow learner, it took me over 40 years to get that sorted out. The serious work started when I was about 15, and things really shaped up when I was about 55. So 40 years to produce an achievement that nobody can even see or assess or praise. Pretty cool, huh? Cue the fireworks! If there\u2019s any benefit for others out of that achievement, it might be that I think I understand the road to this destination better than most: I\u2019ve spent enormous time and energy studying the obstacles and dead-ends along the way, I\u2019ve had to solve the same puzzles over and over again until I felt like I could do it in my sleep, I\u2019ve been wrong about details more times than can be counted, and had to recognize the error the hard way \u2014 by suffering. That understanding of the road is potentially shareable, so that\u2019s a high priority for me \u2014 I see other people struggling with those same puzzles sometimes, and my memory sucks but it\u2019s good enough to recall how painful that can be. Anyway. I\u2019ve got maybe 20\u201330 years left, I think. It seems like a shame that it took so much of my life just to get to the starting line, but at least that\u2019s checked off the list finally. Now I\u2019m interested to see what life is actually like, when it isn\u2019t about \u201cwho am I?\u201d ",

Back in 1992, the Internet opened to the public, a group of us started The Center for Civic Networking to do demonstration projects that applied the Internet to public purposes (read \u201celectronic town meetings\u201d - though we quickly ventured into other areas). As part of our first project - an electronic town meeting in Cambridge, MA - as part of a broader, community-wide visioning exercise - we quickly discovered that most people in Cambridge, outside the university community & some high tech employees, didn\u2019t have Internet access. So\u2026 we set out to provide public access in the Cambridge Public Library. At the time, the only Internet access, in public libraries, anywhere, were a few \u201cFreenet\u201d installations - basically bulletin board systems with limited connectivity, installed by outside groups (\u201ccan we install one of these in the library?\u201d) - with librarians only discovering later that people expected lots of hand holding. We (well, I) proceeded to write a grant proposal to the Apple Library of Tomorrow Program (great losses when Apple shut it down, and when it\u2019s director, Steve Cisler died). Apple gave us a gaggle of top-end Macs, which we proceeded to place in the main Cambridge Library, as well as several additional libraries on Cape Cod. It didn\u2019t hurt that the Library Director was on our Board. Continental Cablevision provided cable modem service (we were their alpha site). Central to our effort was extensive planning with the library staff (down to details of where to put the screens to insure privacy), setting up navigational & local information screens (as well as content related to the community visioning project), training library staff, setting up training sessions for the public, and holding the requisite ribbon-cutting ceremony with politicians & the press in attendance. We were the first public library, anywhere in the world, to provide true, high-speed, Internet access as a routine library service. And then I got to write the only book I know of on planning & implementing library-based Internet access. I set out to find someone to pay for publishing our final report, and ended up writing a book for the American Library Association (ALA) Press. I even made a little money on the book - who know that the ALA had a book club - the book ended up as a monthly selection that went to librarians across the country. Now, computers & Internet access would have shown up in libraries, regardless of our efforts. But we were first, helped to point the way, and perhaps helped some folks avoid some wrong turns. When I think back on the past 45 years or so, I see a number of bigger, more complex projects, perhaps with greater impact - in both smaller & larger roles. But when I ask myself what am I proudest of - I always come back to the library project. ",

            "answer_text": "The highest achievement that I\u2019ve achieved in my lifetime is my job as a computer consultant in Transcanada Pipelines. It was my first job and the only formal job I have had in my life. Therefore, I would consider it as my highest achievement. After graduation from SAIT, I was accepted by a small management consultant company. I didn\u2019t know that I was going to be assigned to Transcanada to do 4D programming and consulting. Honestly speaking, I was very nervous. What I did was to grasp every minute to go over a 4D bible book. I used 3 months to finish that book and felt more confident. My supervisor was very nice to me. He designed a series of applications and I finished them very well. He was very satisfied with me. After finishing this training, I was assigned to become further familiar with 4D applications which Transcanada used as a tester. After 3 months, I was transferred to Department of Transportation to start my independent working as a consultant. I maintained several core applications for them and dealt with their employees at the same time. I did very well and finished my task on time. My supervisor was a 30 year old lady who was responsible for database part. Her name was Debby Yuen. Is she still in Transcanada? She was very loose to me since she fully trusted me. She did not know much 4D. The head of this department Paul Rushton was also very satisfied with my job and planned to give me on call work to maintain the database. I forgot why I did not do it later. I was becoming more and more nearer to them. But unfortunately, I had to go back to do my maternal leave. After half a year, I went back and did one month. My husband decided to let me quit. Everything was very smooth and I did this job very easily. Now when I recalled back, I was actually little scared since if I messed up the applications, the Transcanada would kill me. It was their billing application and other some that I forgot. Although it was not a high programming job, but I still considered it as my highest achievements. It was my first job and would be my last job? Hope I can have another IT job that is waiting for me. Thanks for reading. ",

            "answer_text": "My house was five miles from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, a 100-square mile network of rivers and sloughs. Being a water rat, I was itching to get out and partake.  My dog at the time was a 45-pound Aussie: no fitting him in a kayak. Had to be a canoe. Purchased a Coleman Classic off Craigslist.  I won\u2019t tell you how hoisting it up on the roof of my SUV resulted in it slipping sideways and shearing off the rear view mirror for a $375 bill (the canoe was $60 with paddles). And I won\u2019t tell you how many marinas I called for storage space before I found one that would take me in for my requested fee of $20 a month (marinas expect to make $200\u2013500/boat berth.) But find one I did. Now here\u2019s the problem: the delta (originally swamp) was formed mostly by Chinese laborers, who built levees, then drained the land and formed the sloughs. The \u201cislands\u201d are lower than the water level. They sell boat caddies that attach to canoes, to make them portable, so a person can stand behind and push it like a wheelbarrow. I decided I could make my own out of an old kids bike trailer that was taking up space in the garage. Carriers fit in the middle of the canoe, so the canoer only has to wrangle half the boat weight. My problem was only the nose of the canoe fit into my kids\u2019 bike trailer, so I had to virtually lift the entire weight of the canoe (about 70 pounds) and push it uphill over the top of the levee. Then I had to turn the boat and walk backwards, so the boat wouldn\u2019t just go shooting off into the water on the downhill side. I used to work up quite a sweat with this maneuver, all the while congratulating myself I was boating for $20 a month! Darcy the dog (named after Mr. Darcy of Sense and Sensibility fame), watched from the passenger seat of the car, with a concerned expression, or maybe it was weary resignation, like wouldn\u2019t it be nice to be owned by a human of normal intelligence?  This picture is actually of a sailboat, but Darcy is wearing the same dubious expression. One day, after I sweated my heavy canoe up the levee, raced ahead and then guided it down to the boat ramp, a Vietnamese fisher woman who had watched my antics with fascination, said breathlessly, \u201cYou are strong woman!\u201d She was nearly unable to contain peals of laughter. I invested in a regular boat carrier after that. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm a crazy, crazy MUNner and this is a story from my beginning days of MUNning. We were simulating the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) with the agenda of the Rehabilitation of Syrian Refugees. I was the delegate of Lebanon for the same, a strong country on the agenda. After a week of good research, I finally sat up to write my Position Paper. A Position Paper is the essence of all your research. Though not mandatory, promoted, and recommended, submitting it prior to your conference can earn you real brownie points. A day before the conference, I spent 6 hours on my laptop slogging my head off, compiling that two-page document, putting in details after scanning hundreds of reports, laws, amendments, protocols, and synopsis. It was a daunting task. At 2:10 am, I was almost done. A 30-minute work and I'd get to hit the bed. My eyes were already blood red with all the strain. And my laptop decided to freeze. After uncountable attempts, it did not budge. I cursed myself for not saving my work. The only option left was to shut the laptop down. The document I put my soul in, would be lost. I sat staring at the frozen screen for more than an hour. Finally decided to put it and myself to sleep because a sleepless night would harm my performance at the conference further. Shit had happened. I started to become unsure of whether or not to participate. I had to leave by 9 in the morning. I thought I should just make an excuse and sleep it off. Then it hit me. I'd already incurred a big loss. But here, if I lose my courage, I'll be a real loser. With a brave plan in my head, I put myself to sleep. At 6 am, I sat up, opened the laptop, to do the Position Paper all over again. It may sound an utterly unpractical decision, but was also the best option I had. In a record time of 95 minutes, I made the WHOLE THING again. Yes, AGAIN. At this point, I had drained myself of all the energy I had. Yet, the fact that I could do the document all over again gave me a feeling of invincibility and I lasted all day long participating successfully. I went on to receive the Best Speaker at the conference and also got recommended for Vice-Chair in an upcoming conference. The loss of the document was a major setback, but being able to rise over it and put myself together was my biggest victory here. The trophy I was awarded with was merely a cherry on the cake. Whenever I think of this incident in my life, now, I get major motivation. \u201cIf I've done this, I can do anything!!! \u201d TRULY A VICTORY OVER FAILURE! ",

            "answer_text": "Teaching high school students. Yes I consider this as my biggest one because I had always avoided teaching this group ever since I got my B.Ed. . In my mind, high school students loud, disrespectful, and full of drama. I was so surprised when my principal assigned me to teach this level because I usually had the pre-uni students. She had warned me that some kids could be a handful but some were ok. I will never forget my first day walking to the class and saw them. I felt like I wanted to freeze everything and set the clock to the end of the class. My first two terms were rough with the kids because I got angry all the time and they showed their resistance towards me. But as time went by, I realized that these kids were actually nice. They wanted to be friends with all teachers including me. So I opened up to them a little bit. I played along with their jokes . They liked it when I laughed with them or managed to make me laugh. I like it too because I realized that this way, the kids started warming up to me. I sometimes pull a prank on them too and they responded positively. Apparently when I\u2019m relax, they listen to me more. Our relationship got better. I didn\u2019t get angry as much as I was the first time. I tried to listen to them and use a more sympathetic tone when I talked to. They paid more attention in the class. Weeks ago, the female students were playing a game close to the teachers\u2019 office and I briefly joined as I was walking towards the room. One of them suddenly hugged me so tight and said, \u201cMiss Cindy, I love you.\u201d I hugged her back and said, wholeheartedly, \u201cI love you too.\u201d Years ago I would say \u201cno\u201d if someone asked me whether I wanted to teach high school students or not. I\u2019m glad that my principal assigned me and I took the chance, proving myself wrong. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: What is your biggest achievement in life? It might be the resolute solving of the nature of existence. The finding of the final and complete answer to \u201cWhat is the universe made of, exactly?\u201d. It has always been the \u201cexactly\u201d that has caused the problem. I don\u2019t know that I have. But suspect it might be so, and with some good reasons. Might be a while till I know for sure.  If not that, then I am not sure what the next biggest is. I like unique accomplishments. Like, winning the first 18 games of lawn bowling I ever played, including games against opponents with significantly more experience, and considerable motivation and desire to beat me if they at all possibly could. See. I joined the sport in my early 20s. My parents were in a club, and it looked like good fun. When younger, I had been an alley bowler. In leagues. 5-pin for a couple of years, then 10 pin for 7 or 8. During which time, I got pretty adept. Becoming a scratch bowler. (average of 180 or so). As well as having played soccer for many years, and billiards quite passionately since my late teens.  See. Having been born \u201cslenderish\u201d, and growing lanky through my early years, I was never what one would call naturally athletic. Some might have called me a nerd, or geek. With some justification. But I am also very analytical, and observant. I notice things. Can \u201csee\u201d things. Turns out in a little more detail than many. And I am also competitive. Or was, more so than now, when I was younger. And so, with sports, I would analyze. Look for tricks. Advantages. In soccer, I learned to curve the ball with some accuracy. And then later, when my muscles caught up to my length, I learned how better to use my body to apply force to the ball, and because a wicked hard kicker. In 10-pin bowling, I bought myself a custom bowling ball. Well, a couple, actually. The second one, my \u201cfor life\u201d bowling ball (not that I bowl hardly ever anymore), I put research into. I bought a ball specifically for alley grip. A dull black rubbery surface. And then for the hole drilling, I had it done at the extreme offset from the center of the weight block allowed by the rules. (10-pin balls have a small block of denser material on the side where the finger holes will be drilled, so the loss of material will not cause too much lop-sidedness. There are rules about where, and how many, and how wide, and how deep, you can have your ball drilled for your grip. Mine are at the maximum right side. Putting the balls overall center of gravity, just off-center by a tiny amount. This affects its ability to curve or hook when thrown.) Well. Back to lawn bowling. Lawn bowls have a built in bias. One side is curved differently than the other. There is a \u201csmall side\u201d, and a \u201clarge side\u201d. So when it is running fast, it will tend to \u201cstand up\u201d onto its maximum radius and run straight. As it slows down, it will lean over more and more towards the small side, in a curve that decreases in radius as the bowl slows further.  So the possible paths will look something like below, one side is shown, it is reversible.  Once an end is underway, it quickly gains aspects that relate to billiards or curling. Combinations and caroms. Reflections and deflections. Transfer of kinetic energy though multiple collisions at various angles.  It is true that some of my earlier games were against newer or less skilled players. But not at all, all of them. In around game 5 or 6 the Tuesday night men's league began, and being early in the season more leads than skips were showing up. So on the second night, the team selector chose to promote me to skip temporarily. This caused a bit of a ruckus. Apparently it as a position of honour and was desired. and several elder members with several years experience, who were designated leads, objected to my being made skip on my second night. One gent, who later became a good friend, once he got over what went down that night, was the loudest objector. And also got made a skip. And by chance got drawn against me. He was a fine man. An ex-fighter pilot. (this was back in the 80s). Well. He had made it clear he intended to win. And I, very much wished to not have my position questioned based on my age, and experience, rather than my ability. And thought perhaps they could have handled their objections a little more tactfully. I think it fair to say, I too saw \u201cmotivated\u201d. This sounds a little \u201cbraggy\u201d. But it really wasn\u2019t fair. I was, yes, inexperienced at lawn bowling. But my accumulated experiences and interests had really turned me into a \u201cprogrammed lawn bowling machine\u201d that had never been used for that purpose. My billiards gave me the ability to know what would occur if the \u201chead\u201d was hit from a certain angle with a certain force. As surely as I could spell my own name. And the single focus in 10 pin bowling is the delivery of a ball over a distance, with a hook, to a specific millimeter or finer if one is attempting to convert a split. And the ability to throw 16 pounds hard, and dead straight on demand. For when that is what needed. So then, come to an end in a game of lawn bowling. Maybe sitting down a couple. You have options\u2026 knock a couple out, end up a few up. Draw in, cut the two and earn one. Or you send a zinger straight up the throat, and blast the head to smitherines\u2026 bowls and the jack landing where you intend, predict, or where they will. That is called \u201cthe runner\u201d. In the right hands, it is an atomic bomb that a lawn bowler can drop anytime the situation is not optimal. From alley-bowling to lawn-bowling, the transfer of the ability to do that, through very hard, very straight, to a very specific point, is pretty much 100%. Not much calibration or adjustment needed. It just works. And in alley bowling, you tend to be able to hit a single pin about 98 times out of 100 when at the scratch bowler level. Which then applied to lawn bowling\u2026 the two leads take turn about, throwing their 4 bowls. Then it is the skips turn. Now there is the \u201cjack\u201d\u2026 it is the \u201ctarget\u201d\u2026 the goal is, after each team has thrown 8 bowls, give a point to the bowl that is closest to the team it belongs to, and then another for each of their bowls that is closer than the best of the other teams bowls. So the skip steps up. The situation is either: up 1 to 4 bowls for the end (1 round of play), or down 1 to 4 bowls. With the 8 arranged around the jack. In theory where the Skip asked the lead to put them. The skips then roll their 4 bowls, turn about. Each time I stepped up, I held one of 4 atomic bombs, if I felt like it. (insert a lot of evil grins, and buahahahahas). If we had a couple close, but one of theirs was closer, there was the snipe option. If they were sitting a few, but there was a line to the jack\u2026 no problem, nail the jack and take it with you. They go from up a few to down one or more. And have nothing close to try to turn it back to several in their favour. (This is also quite disheartening for the other team, going from sitting pretty to down and without reason for hope.) Oh this retelling is starting to feel a little evil. Because, admittedly, ego, youth, objection to being objected to, I did get my lawn-bowl \u201cdukes\u201d up. And I did pummel said vociferous objector. Some 21 to 1 or something like that. (Poor guy). I should also admit. That while I had fair good fortune, entering tournaments, the many that happen around the province for cash prizes and a very nice day out\u2026 I also entered the official pyramid of competition, the \u201cclub-regional-provincial-national\u201d yearly setup done annually. A few times. And got my own handed right back to me on many many occasions!! Years of good fun.  But yes. On the list of \u201cproudest accomplishments\u201d, I think I like that one, because I figure it is probably relatively unique. I figure not too many people, even the world champion lawn bowlers, won their first 18. Some. Maybe. But not many. :-D If I am wrong about having solved existence\u2026 at least I won my first 18 games of lawn bowling. lol. Made a few kids, and performed some miracles in IT in between. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, my achievement is different from others. It's not about money making job or owning a luxury Villa or car .  Look at the above picture , this was my life five years back in 2015 . I was diagnosed with kidney failure at a very young age of 18 and was ungergoing regular dialysis session . I was totally bedridden and became so weak that I couldn't even walk and I used to have frequent attacks ( i can't even explain that feeling in words here ) and because of that I was admitted in ICU many times. While most of my friends were making their career and Enjoying their life , I was struggling to survive every day . I was physically , mentally and emotionally broken but luckily I had my parents to support me and they kept motivating me to live. I had almost lost all the hopes to live because I was fed up with dialysis session which were so painful. I still remember my fistula surgery , how painful it was !!!!! Also, I wasn't even allowed to drink water. Can you all imagine my suffering\u2026.a young boy who had so many dreams about his life was hooked up to dialysis machines in the hospital . I am very grateful to my mommy \u2764\ufe0f as she decided to donate her kidney to me and after two painful years , I underwent kidney transplant surgery and it literally changed my life in such a good and positive way. I finally found hope to live my life and now I am living my life to the fullest.  It's been almost four years since I underwent kidney transplant surgery. I am living a healthy life again. Fullfilling my goals and dreams. I love travelling so much . So , the very first thing I did was to go on a solo travelling around the world after my surgery. I have travelled to 13 countries and counting. My dream is to travel the world.  This is me now. From struggling each day to survive to living my life to the fullest. I have come a long way and so proud of myself \u2764\ufe0f  For me living a healthy and happy life is the greatest achievement in life . I am living a healthy life by God's grace and I am very grateful and thankful to my mommy for gifting me her kidney. Much love to all and take care of yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe my biggest achievement till date has been \"Getting out of my comfort zone and pursuing my dream no matter how weird, stupid, disturbing the situations had been\" I always loved writing but somehow just like all Indian children are treaded on the same path I was put into Engineering. And trust me I never had the nerve or the confidence to tell my family that Engineering was not my thing. By my second year, I started participating into events and polished my skills. By the end of fourth year I had started a blog, started writing on Quora and was reading literally 3 books in a week. There was a marked improvement in my vocabulary and thought procedure. The battle began thereafter.I read about Startups in India on Quora and I thought this will be a place where I will get to learn and do the work I want. My parents wanted me to join Syntel, an IT firm whose offer letter had already came. A long battle of trying to convince them, fight, argue, cry, continued for one month. I did not budge and at one moment I declared that I am going to Mumbai to join a startup that has sent me it's offer letter.Seeing how adamant I was about it, my parents agreed half heartedly. For the first time I was stepping out of my home. I has never done an air journey. Trust me I did not even know what to do at the airport. I landed in Mumbai, started living alone.It's only when you start living alone that you realize there are so many things to take care of. From your clothes, food, house to electricity bills, bank works, taxations.I knew nothing. Plus the work at my job was also very new. I could write but Digital marketing is a very different field all together.Being emotionally independent, travelling alone, taking care of yourself and learning everything was going parallel for me. I became like a combination of filter and sponge.  I lost track of time, I was learning and learning. Things were messy. I was out for the first time. I did not know how to conduct myself. What to say and what not to. Whom to trust and who not to. I made a lot of mistakes. When i say \"a lot\" that means a lot. It was a struggle. Then last month I again hit rock bottom. I left my first job. I wanted to do so much more so I started applying in startups for the role of Digital Marketing Strategist. I interviewed at 8 startups an gladly got offer letters from all of them. But that wasn't an easy task as well. I was very very keen on working for a specific one-  WebEngage. While on my way to the interview of this startup, I met an accident. My trousers were torn, my knees were bleeding and all but all I had in mind was that the CEO might not be available after that and it would be a disrespect of his time. I bought another pair of trousers, washed my injuries and went limping for the interview. (it was hilarious, I looked like a run away kid) I got my offer letter that very day after the interview. I had a strange medical reaction that very night at 3 am. I was also on a nine day fast. For a moment I thought why is everything happening at once. 15 days passed. These entire 7 months changed me as a person on so many levels. I became cautious, I became patient, I understood that life is not always fair but I also understood no matter what we should be grateful for what we have. I joined my new job, new challenges have come. But life should be full of challenges because it doesn't shine in comfort. Life is never as difficult as we think it will be and every good or bad time passes away. I feel proud when I look back in time and compare the timid, underconfident girl who would not even go to the market alone to this girl who is staying alone in a city , earning and living one heck of a life. It is a major achievement for me. Battling clinical depression was also one. But this one strengthened me enough to tackle anything. Just remember one thing:- REFUSE TO QUIT, NO MATTER WHAT!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Answering this question runs perilously close to self-aggrandizement and narcissism, and I would ordinarily eschew its like, but I was just ruminating on this subject today while cleaning & reorganizing my studio, and the weird coincidence intrigued me. Without too much self-promotion or self-congratulations, then, permit me to attest that I have lived the life I have wanted to live: full of unexpected choices, eccentric detours, & prodigious achievements\u2014 playing music (European classical & Balinese gamelan); inventing and patenting alternative energy system devices; going to sea on a commercial fishing boat (on which I eventually became the skipper); volunteering as a teacher in a public high school; making artwork (& winning awards); making movies; being a published author several times over; designing and building elaborate landscape gardens\u2014 the list is really rather satisfying, as an objective measure of a curriculum vitae, or lifework. How interesting in my own mind, then, that these were not the achievements that loom largest in my memory or imagination. In 2007 I helped my adopted Ukrainian family start a small business that has launched them (and several of their close friends) from a humble\u2014 sometimes arduous\u2014 lower-middleclass existence to a solidly upper middle class life (I continue as the CFO of this boutique company, but I must give credit where credit is due: my partner is brilliant is managing our plan, and both she & her husband have been tireless in doing the hard work). I think I\u2019ve been a good friend, & that seems like an achievement. Even more so, though, I've been a good son. My stepfather died in 2012, leaving my 67 year old mom feeling rather adrift and irrelevant in her own life. My pop was younger than my mom, & I had always assumed I would end up caring for him in his old age, but our plans seldom work out the way we expect. I have a brother, but he lives in the bottom of a whiskey bottle, so there really wasn\u2019t anyone else, though this point should not be mistaken for reluctance on my part. My mom is 72 now, and spends half her year with me in St.Petersburg, Florida, in a \u201chouse\u201d I built for her attached to my own, giving her a sense of independence essential to her well-being, simultaneous with a rich family life that has largely ameliorated her feelings of loneliness (she spends the other half of the year in the house she shared with my pop, in a lovely meadow in New York State\u2019s Catskill Mountains, where I visit her in the summer). My mom has been\u2014 and continues to be\u2014 a truly great mother, and she is just too young for her life to be over yet (we have a longevity gene in our family that may see her into her nineties). It pleases me to have helped her find the next chapter of her life: she deserves it, & I think my pop would be proud of me, and that\u2019s an achievement I don\u2019t mind claiming\u2026 ",

Look how happy they are because they got to see one of their most recent favorite characters from a movie. Look how happy they were to go to the fair that they didn't even know they were going to. Yep, it's easy to see the thrill in this picture, but what you don't see is the mom behind the camera silently wiping tears from her eyes because she was able to do this for them. You don't see the two hundred dollars that was pinched painfully that entire month so they could have this moment. You don't see the father standing off to the side and you don't see the look that was shared between mom and dad that wordlessly agreed \u2014 this was all worth it! See, before we had children we were both addicts. I don't often include him in my answers because that is his story, but we are both well aware that had we not changed, we would not have our children today. Change \u2026 such an easy word to say but such a hard thing to do. We clawed and fought our way through hell together in the trenches of addiction and we carried eachother out. .

            "answer_text": "Surviving the last 5 years, and having coped mentally with the last couple of months. For context, I have severe mental health issues which were initially recognised 5 years ago. I have tried to commit suicide more times than I can count and have come across so many negative, judgemental people as well as fought with the horrifically underfunded mental health system. I've been left to languish in the community because nobody knew where to look for an appropriate bed, or been told that while I need a bed, they don't have any. The last two months I've been fighting with unspecified, undiagnosable GI issues. I've had a dietician recommend a nasogastric (feeding) tube because she considers me to be at a very high risk of malnutrition. But despite 3 admissions and 5 ED attendances for this problem alone, despite the fact that I'm so dizzy I'm using a wheelchair to get around outside, despite that all my benefits this month went on taxis and other expenses directly or indirectly related to these issues, despite all of that I'm rarely self harming and am, by my standards at least, stable. Sometimes just getting through is massively underrated. Sometimes it's ignored that getting out of bed each morning and, in my case, fighting dizziness, nausea, vomiting, brain fog, abdominal pain, joint pain, migraines and a multitude of other things, can be the biggest achievement at all. I am immensely proud of the most fundamental thing of all: being alive. Because unless I can manage that I'm never going to fix or deal with everything else wrong with my life. ",

            "answer_text": "I have learned that success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has had to overcome while trying to succeed. ~ Booker T. Washington I\u2019ve always been an active child in my school. I was always class monitor . Always aced my exams. But, in 10th class my health started to deteriorate. I would be having fever one day to some really bad cold other day. I would miss my school for 2\u20133 months together. I got hospitalized thrice in my 10th standard. Same went on in my 11th standard. I used to get so ill. One day fever, another day some digestive issue then allergies on my eyes, in which big bumps would grow up. I would always feel so helpless. My classmates used to make fun of me, how I was always sick. This used to hurt me so much! I still remember a coversation between me and my (so-called) friend. (My health got better and I started going to school regularly. I went to play basketball as I always wanted to be in some kind of sport. After giving trial , I got selected.) Then, this is how the conversation went like- Friend - Oh Hi Ashmeet. How are you feeling now? I heard you got hospitalised. Me - I\u2019m feeling much better now. Just came after giving basketball trial. Friend - Basketball WHAT? Vaise toh tu hmesha bimaar rehti hai, school toh dikhti nahin hai aur ab tujhe basketball khelni hai?? (Translation - Most of the times you are sick and can\u2019t be even seen in school and now you want to play basketball?) This conversation made me feel so bad about myself! I felt like nobody understands that even if I\u2019m sick, I still want to play and enjoy. Afterall, nobody gets sick intentionally! Then, I passed my 11th with 70% marks and was shattered because I used to be in the top-scorer\u2019s always. In 12th, my health was more or less same. But, this time I affirmed to myself that I will take care of my health no matter what. I took the whole responsibility of my health and didn\u2019t depend on anybody. With grace of god, my health got better. Boards were approaching. My class teacher motivated me to put my heart and soul and give my 110% in these exams. I was also filled up with all the bad experiences of the past. All the taunts of friends and scoldings by teachers. I gave my exams and finally results came .  I was second stream topper and left behind all those who used to taunt me and made me worthless! Everything in life depends on how we perceive it. My biggest achievement indeed, is proving myself, not to anybody else but to my own self because I know my worth and capabilities more than anybody else! Only I know, how I felt when anyone would make fun of me. I MADE MYSELF PROUD!\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb Thankyou for reading .\ud83d\ude0a ",

            "answer_text": "When I was a kid I played little league baseball. I played left field. During a final championship game we were winning by 1 point in the bottom of the 9th. There were two men on base with two outs, and the other teams best hitter at bat. My friend Joey played center field, he was a good guy but a little nervous disposition, anyway, the batter hits a high fly ball out to center field, I could see Joey was scared to death. I start running across the field to back him up, but I'm too late the ball comes down hits Joey's glove and bounces in the air going behind him, I take a huge dive across the field my glove extended, I hit the ground in a cloud of dust, when I look in my glove there is the ball. I made the catch, batter is out and we won the game. I was a freaking hero. All our teams parents in the bleachers are cheering, the team including coach Tom run out on the field and are hugging me and patting me on the back and cheering me. After the game coach Tom treated us to a huge pizza party at Pizza hut. He presented me with the trophy, which sat in my bedroom for years after, well the trophy is long gone today but that moment in time still brings a smile to my face, whenever I think of it, it really was the greatest achievement of my life. As an adult I've done a lot of cool things, I've helped people, I saved two people in a car accident, but that one moment was still the best. ",

            "answer_text": "On July 8, 2016, I was honored with the Genesis Home Run for Life award in front of 4,000 cheering fans during my hometown\u2019s minor league baseball game. Genesis, my local healthcare provider, recognizes a few individuals each year who have relentlessly fought and overcome their medical illnesses. I was nominated and walked the bases during the top of the fourth inning while my entire community was chanting my name. The 360-foot walk around the bases was an extremely emotional moment for me because exactly one year prior, I was completely wheelchair-bound from a spinal cord injury, known as Transverse Myelitis, that I had endured. This honorable recognition was well worth the hundreds of grueling therapy appointments, thousands of sit-to-stands, and hours on the leg bike that helped me trade in my wheelchair for my own two feet. Here are some images from my big day:  I am standing in the striped shirt. Everyone of my supporters was wearing a Team Kale t-shirt.  The stadium was packed, and I can say I was very nervous that I might trip and fall.  My elementary school crush. Funny story, in the fifth grade on Valentine\u2019s day, everyone was passing around the candy they brought. Later that afternoon, I noticed a letter in my candy bag, and it was from this girl\u2014Zoe. I was so happy because the letter asked if I wanted to be her boyfriend. However, I was so shy and nervous that I never responded to her! Not even to this day! Damn, I was dumb.  THE SQUAD Ultimately, I had a tremendous time and was extremely honored to have been recognized in front of my entire community. ",

            "answer_text": "I think my biggest achievement is the way I fought with my depression and came out of it on my own. It all started when I was in my 3rd year of engineering. I had a breakup and it affected my professional and personal life. It started with my breakup and from there, things started taking ugly turns. After that, I failed in engineering, my grades went low. I stopped going for CAT coaching. I lost my confidence. The same year I lost my grandfather and it was a set back too. I started drinking and smoking. I was under immense pressure and depression. I was so depressed that one day in anger I shaved my head. I was studying on scholarship. I was in the college hostel(It was free for me), when my father came to know about my situation, he made sure that I move out of the hostel. He even got me a new smartphone so I can get over my depression. I belong to a lower-middle-class family and when I realized how much my parents care for me, I understood how I am spoiling my life. That day, I promised my self that I will work hard and come out of this hell, which I only created. I stopped going for my CAT classes and focused on Job. I cleared my exams and completed my engineering with 7.8 CGPA. I got a decent job in an MNC. I worked hard and saved 25K INR which I gifted to my parents for their 25th Wedding Anniversary. I quit smoking and now I drank only occasionally. Later I joined the gym and started working out regularly. In 2016, I came to Bangalore. I promised myself to have a fresh start. Now its been two years I am in Bangalore. I am doing good and I hope to do it better. I have achieved quite a few things after coming to Bangalore like I fell in love again and trust me love can happen twice. I bought my first bike with my savings and the feeling was awesome. Worked hard on my fitness, followed diet and reduced about 15kgs. Started My YouTube channel named Saddaa India and started taking Quora seriously. Recently I crossed, 200 subscribers on YouTube and 1K followers on Quora. I know maybe for some of you these achievements are not considerable, but I believe in small steps, one step by one. I am trying my best and I hope to get best out of me in future. That's my new bike: Suzuki INTRUDER  This is me in 2016, I gained weight after finishing my studies.  And this is me in 2017.  Here is the picture of my Aadhar card for which I applied a few days later after shaving my head.  I hope now you guys believe in me. Never Give Up, Trust me your time will come. Always remember that good thing takes time. Just follow your heart and start enjoying the journey of your life. Don't kill yourself, Kill the Depression If anyone of you is going through such depression, please feel free to reach out. You can text me and share your problems. I know it's not gonna change something but trust me if you talk about it you will feel relieved. Just let it go. Keep reading and Keep Learning. Thank you so much for your time. See you soon.

            "answer_text": "At 24, my life until now is full of adventure. I was born in a low middle-class family in Patna, Bihar. My mom and dad were working so they don't have so much time either me or for my brother. When I was around 5,6 year old, I like to play cricket very much and roaming around my neighbourhood for the guys who can play cricket with me. My dad didn't find it right they might think (ki main biggar jagua ) because my locality, wasn't good. Then they took the decision to send me to a cricket academy so that I can play and utilized my energy in the right place. I still remember I was in class 3rd on the time when I took admission into the Academy after that I was doing really good in cricket played state for few years for different age groups and on that time Bihar has affiliation issue so players have to switch states if they want to play for state and explore opportunities in a bigger level. So I decided that after my 10th I will leave my state for better opportunities. Due to involvement in cricket, I was not able to study and I did not want to study. I wanted to play and chill. In my 8th standard, I got 49% marks and fail in maths  The idea behind sharing my 8th standard mark sheet is to tell that I was so bad at my studies. Then in 2011, I came to Delhi after my 10th examination. After coming to Delhi and playing local cricket for 1.5 year my coach refer me to appear in U-16 state trail. Fortunately I got selected in U-16 state camp but due to domicile issue. I was kicked out of the camp. Now 12 board is very important for everyone and crucial for the college admission process. *This is the point where I have to think what to do* Cricket? OR Study? Cricket is full of probability (everything or nothing). My family financial condition was not well I have chosen study to at least give my family a better life. Here some of my cricketing achievement. This was my image on google.The other one with the ex-chief minister of Bihar Rabri Devi.  ISHAN Kishan U-19 INDIA CAPTAIN AND MUMBAI INDIAN OPENER was my childhood friend. We have played together for many years and due to affiliations problem he went to Jharkhand and I went to Delhi.  In September 2012 I have decided to take my study seriously and left Cricket forever. I had 5 months to prepare for my 12 Examination. I devoted all my time to study and start preparing for my 12th. I scored 79% in my 12th with self-study after that I did maths honours from Delhi University and completed with distinction on the same subject in which I failed in class 8th. After my graduation, I went to Hansraj college for my masters in operation research only a few top colleges in India offer this course. In master, I got the placement with the package of 7.5 LPA and currently working for the organization. My class topper in school is still searching for a job and all. I am not demoralising anyone. I just want to give an important message here by this. The intent of learning anything and capabilities inside you can only be taken out by you. **Trust your struggle** This quote is a building block of any house of your dream. I am not landed into cricket but I am happy that I am providing a better life to my parents.

Small childhood achievements But I am proud of many things that I achieved when I was younger. I used to be an honor student. I love how I see my parents\u2019 proud faces whenever I would come to the stage during recognition ceremonies where medals would be put around my neck. I used to be a campus writer during high school. I am not the best one but I guess some people saw something in me and they told me that I had the potential. So, I was often sent to writing contests and I would often bring medals and awards. I even made it through the Regional School Press Conference. Our paper even made it through the Nationals. For a teenage girl, that was already a huge achievement. But of course, my high school career would eventually have come to an end. Three years later, they don\u2019t even matter. I got a full scholarship in a small private institution for college and finished Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. Since it was a tri-semestral school, the supposed to be four year degree was shortened to three years. I graduated in college at 19 years old.  I started working freelance to build a portfolio for myself and increase my chances of employment. I got my first office job at 20 years old, which happened just a month ago. This job brought me a taste of freedom. Although, I am not actually independent yet but I am halfway there. Those may be small compared to other's achievements but I am quite proud of them. I am allowed to feel that way, right? What am I really most proud of? I hate waking up in the morning because that means that I have to leave the fantasy world of dreams where everything goes my way and then I have to wake up back to the reality. I hate leaving my bed and leaving my comfort zone but I still do them. I have to go to work just like everyone else. Since I live in the Phillipines, one of our biggest problem is the lack of decent public transportations. The trains are currently being repaired and has only 7 trains working. It takes an hour or two to wait for the train and when they come, people are squeezed like a tuna fish inside just to get to work. I have to put on my game face playing the chasing the bus game. Same with the trains, people are squeezed inside like a can of tuna. Chances of being groped, your stuff being snatched away during that 15\u201330 minute ride on the way to work is incredibly high. In fact, I lost count of how many times someone has inappropriately touched me accidentally or not or how many little items in my bag were lost. One of my greatest fears used to be being around the crowd but I have no choice but to be around them every single day. It doesn't get any better and I can't afford using uber or taxi every single day because they are incredibly expensive. Complaining won't do much. I just have to face it and get used to it.  Sometimes when work becomes too stressful to handle it makes me want to go to the bathroom for a few minutes then cry about it because I have to face this everyday. I have many insecurities, I have many doubts, I have many questions and in the back of my mind there\u2019s always a voice saying you\u2019re nothing, you\u2019re worthless, you won\u2019t reach anything in life. There are dark times where I could find myself believing them and I can\u2019t get up from this misery that my own mind created. But I will eventually find a way. There is no room for quitting. I have so many dreams and I don't want them to remain a dream. Perhaps, this is my biggest achievement. Finding my motivation to reach my goal despite of how hard and stressful it is. I\u2019ve also been chosen as one of the Quora Top Writer 2018. That\u2019s gotta count too, right? ",

            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: I don\u2019t mean to boast. I managed to win the very first race against a million other \u2018would-have-been\u2019 brothers/sisters, which is the reason am here today.I have never won a race after that.They called me a champion when it was marbles time(popularly known as Kanche or Goti).I had more than 15 1.5 litre bottles filled with these little shiny gems.Until 9, I had nothing to be proud of academically. But the day came when I was awarded the first prize in an Essay competition.Interestingly enough, I was the only participant from the primary section of the school, the others were all high school and middle school kids.I guess the other\u2019s were just too bad. Or was I just too good?They year after, I achieved the above feat yet again. When I was on stage, our now principal, who used to be our class teacher the year before, refused to award me my prize, because she couldn\u2019t believe that a brat as naughty as I am, could actually win a fucking essay competition. (She missed the prize ceremony the year before.) Thereafter, I was sent to a boarding school. There\u2019s where I achieved a lot of things - The first day my took me to this school, there were 165 students there, of which 85 had cleared the written test. Of the 85, 84 had copied from my sheet, which the invigilator happily circulated in the class, right before me. Of the 84, less than 50 cleared a screening for an interview. Of the 50, only 1 cleared the interview. The one that tried hard to fuck it up.The first day of the academic year, I noticed they used a bell to signal everything. Breakfast? Ring the bell(twice). School\u2019s over? Ring the bell (20 times) Reading time? Ring the bell(once). Your playing time\u2019s over, get your ass back in the castle? Ring the bell(a hundred times), fucking hard. Within hours, I developed an enmity towards that bell. And as always, I had that tingling feeling of doing something rebellious with it. I wanted to fuck things up in this new place. After school, you\u2019re usually allowed to play until called back. What did I do? I sneaked out of my classroom before the last period and sprinted near to the bell and rang it like it had never been rung before. I had my eyes on the classroom doors. The few seniors, who were discipline heads, came running out and spotted me, came running towards me while I was just laughing like an idiot(I still remember this scene like it happened yesterday), meaning to convey \u201cthe damage is done, big guy. Shut your run up already! hahaha\u201d I was down on the floor, my senior held me there, my principal stood right before me, and I was lectured for over an hour. For what it was worth? It was a MIND BLOWING DEAL!I walked in to the playgroud, with a detention for the whole month, like a boss. The news spreaded fast and I was being congratulated by faces I didn\u2019t even recognise. That was the beginning of my achievements in that school.I went on to become one of the toppers of that and the next four academic year.The seniors had grown fond of me, owing to my rebellious nature.Everywhere I went, there was an incharge for others, and then there was one other just for me.The detention classes: We are expected to stay up late until midnight and either learn new words, write lines that spelled the name of god, or just simply read a scripture and right a summary of what you read. Trust me, it only sounds easy. When you\u2019re waking up at 4:30 every fucking day, you\u2019re already half asleep all day. And then they make you stay awake. That\u2019s some sick punishment right there. BUT. Like Fred and George came to the rescue of the Hogwarts students from Umbridge, I, the 12 year old brat, came to the rescue of all my friends in detention. Of course, I didn\u2019t have any Weasleys' Wildfire Whiz-bangs like them, but what I did have were A HELL LOT of comics. I made a deal with everybody, that they\u2019d do all the labor work they ask us to do in CBSE, in return, I\u2019d provide them my comics, which they happily read and wrote the stories in their own words in a book. BINGO!I\u2019d call that deal an achievement. I managed to run this scandal until 8th grade, I think that\u2019s pretty cool. 8th grade:I was somehow made one of the monitor of the dormitory. Why the hell would I argue?I stood in the elections for the grade leader and won.(Grades 8\u201312, all have 4 grade leaders each, of which one becomes the chief. In total, you have 20 grade leaders, of which one becomes the Captain of the school, which is usually only from class 11th or 12th)Among the grade leaders, I won again. Fair game, public voting.I became the chief.First meeting I ever attended with the captain, I opened my mouth. Somehow, the 8th grade leaders are only expected to shut up and listen. But I had had enough with our library. That place had nothing but a stack of newspapers and a lot of religious books.After the meeting, I went to my captain and gave him a few marvel comics I had. That\u2019s all it took. He got the funding from the principal and stacked the library up with Marvel, DC, Archie, Tinkle, Chacha Chaudary and others. A 10th grade leader asked me a favor and I obliged. He told me we needed books too. That\u2019s when the super cool Captain brought in everything from Harry Potter to The Alchemist in to the Library.The librarian didn\u2019t like me much after that because as a part of his job, he was supposed to arrange these newly arrived books in to different sections which he didn\u2019t seem to enjoy. He resigned. He was mid 20s guy with a degree in Arts. What the fuck were you doing being a Librarian? Clearly, you don\u2019t like books anyway.And then arrived an awesome librarian. Smart, Knowledgeable and right for the job. Achievement indeed!I managed to get a place in the school\u2019s Basketball team.Point Forward, if anyone\u2019s wondering. Fun-fact: I was the shortest player to ever play for the team: 4\u20325We managed to win a tournament that year. Yay! Shit feels like yesterday\u2026 Am I crying? of course NOT!Our team won the state level rounds for a national level IT competition.The school has a scheme, wherein if your academic progress has been good enough and had met the target given to you, you\u2019re then taken to a trip to some place in India. Me and 12 others, from 1200 people in our school, were gifted a 4 night stay in Bangalore. We went to Wonderla!!!, it\u2019s a water park.You know the slide where you need to be a certain height to ride it?Well the guy in charge of that slide denied my existence. But I said fuck it, this is mah lyf. I stopped midway. The ride came to a halt because of me. Lifeguards were all out. They had to save me. I was struck between a ride at some 60 feet above the ground.For a few minutes, I had the attention of every person in the 82 acre land. That\u2019s an achievement!Am not prod of it. I did a stupid thing, don\u2019t do this. Please follow the rules at public places, they\u2019re there for our own safety.I hosted the annual day function and my parents, for the first time ever, couldn\u2019t make it to see what I am capable of. And then they ask me how come they never get to see any of the things people say am good at.I wrote and directed a play for the annual day function.I don\u2019t remember who was the chief guest, but the play got a standing ovation from every breathing soul in the crowd.But no one bothered to ask who wrote or directed the play. Pity!Writing is what am most proud of.And then the achievements are repetitive. We won two more Basketball tournaments in the following two years.I wrote another play in 9th grade for the annua day(I hosted it along with a friend. I hosted a couple of more events too that year). That one got a standing ovation too.In 10th grade, we were not allowed to do a lot of stuff. But we managed to do yet another play on the annual day (They missed me, I didn\u2019t host it). I was very much hoping that people would love it and was expecting a standing ovation\u2026. until a friend of mine playing a son in the play, who was supposed to cry, gave a chuckle halfway through crying, and the whole audience caught the sight and burst out laughing and the intensity was immediately lost.This was my last play in the school. I had to get it right. This scene was just the start, there was still some good 20 minutes of the play left. If the actors could manage it, and if the audience picks up the story, then it\u2019s a win. And it happened, a standing ovation. Still, nobody ever asked who wrote/directed it.But I was still happy, very HAPPY.And then I happily gave my boards without learning shit. Came back to Mumbai! Haven\u2019t achieved much after that, except - Discovering QUORA. Learning everyday through it.Meeting and talking to people who are actually the big guns of the real world.Thank you, QUORA. Thanks for the A2A, Annu! For people who don\u2019t know her, she\u2019s an amazing writer and one of the most underrated one at that. She mostly writes about Harry Potter, the book series and the movie franchise. And trust me, she\u2019s one good observer. So, if you have a question from the HP series, she\u2019s the one you ask. fin! ",

            "answer_text": "My baby sister is 5 years younger to me and currently pursuing MBBS from China. She studies 27 hours a day (her words) and will be a kickass surgeon one day. Mummy, Papaji and myself are all eagerly waiting for that beautiful day. Five years back when she discovered that medicine is her true calling, she knew she only wanted to do MBBS. She couldn't get a government college seat and we weren't affluent enough to pay the hefty donations all the private institutions were demanding. She took a drop, and prepared even more rigorously. Even though her efforts were top notch, the stiff competition and heavily politicized system beat her. It was then we found this university in China where she would get in on merit and not on donation and the overall expenditure, although hefty for us, would be spanned out across 5 years and it would still be less than the big donation amount the private colleges were demanding to give a seat. She cleared the same and at the young age of 18, she took the bold step to move to China and has never looked back. It was a big cultural shock for her, and along with the highly demanding academics, she had to manage everything else (literally) on her own. My baby sister, who hadn't even deposited a cheque in the bank, managed everything beautifully. She learnt to read, write and speak their language, found a house on her own, managed her finances every month and cracked all the exams every semester. She made alot of mistakes along the way but learnt and emerged stronger everytime. My parents managed the funds for her in the initial years, they pooled in their savings, took education loans etc. Then sometime back I too started earning well and took over for my parents and started to contribute financially for her education and monthly expenses. It's been 2 years that I've been earning well. My fellow colleagues have saved enough to purchase a car, travel abroad, give down payment for a flat, buy gold etc, but I have minimal to zero savings, and I couldn't be more satisfied. My parents look at me with pride and my sister is giving it her all in that foreign land. My friend Talha told me these words which touched me - \"You're an enabler Suvadra. You're enabling your sister to learn and achieve her dream. We are proud of you.\" I think seeing my baby sister grow into this wonderful human being and helping her on the path to become a doctor, is my biggest achievement. Every time she saves a life, I would know that I am a part of it. :) P.S: That's my sister in the picture. Please send some blessings and positive energy her way.  ",

No certificates to hang upon my wall or letters-of-standing to follow my name. Yet I am educated and intelligent. I have yet to make a lasting contribution to either the arts or the sciences which would preserve my name and leave a legacy deemed worthy by the masses. Yet I like to believe that I have touched the lives of those my path has crossed and left some impression of merit behind, as many of them have left with me. I have no title beyond the familial save friend. I've never been knighted, though I have been called Sir on occasion, and my armor of will has been scuffed and tarnished by life. Yet I would defend those I love to my dying breath. I've made no blazed no trails into the unknown and the paths my feet have trod were all well-worn by those who went before me. Yet I have made wondrous discoveries for myself in the realms of literature, the cinema and music which has catapulted my own imagination light years away and left me with a love for words and a hunger for more. What I have accomplished might seem minimal to some but they were accomplishment nevertheless. Yet which of them might be the greatest and a source of pride? It's appropriate that this is the first question that I stumble upon this morning because my eldest daughter's graduation ceremony was last night. She is quite proud of herself, as she well should be, for she's already taken a job as a result of that education. Yet I am prouder still and so very happy for her.  Which leads me what I deem my greatest accomplishment - raising my three children as a single parent. In this day and age, I know there are many who can relate to this. We love our children and give them our all. We set our own dreams upon a shelf, somewhere in the back of our minds, to gather dust; in turn, we help them discover their own and lift those dreams up, into the light, to be set free. And we whisper in their ears to chase them for all they're worth. They are all grown now, though the youngest is still in college. A tall, strong son and two lovely, intelligent daughters. I am not a prideful man yet I am proud of them.  Would you like to know a secret? Even were I to have riches untold or had climbed the highest mountain or swam the deepest ocean; were I to have composed a symphony or concerto to rival Beethoven himself or penned some masterpiece of literature that would be remembered and loved down through the ages...my answer would be the same. The role of parent is an unheralded one and that of single parent even moreso. It is not one, I believe, that any of us expect to gain praise for and, were we to, it would likely seem silly or even embarrass us. I certainly wish for none. We have the love of our children and the knowledge that we kept them safe and taught them all we could before releasing them out into the world. They know our sacrifices and we, in turn, know their dreams. And that is enough. ",

When I started I didn't know how to write, what actually I should write and why I even want to write but with all these questions in my mind I continued writing. I tried many different approaches. The biggest problem used to be to remember everything to write at the end of the day. Writing helped me a lot in reforming myself and achieving a lot of things in life. In the process of learning to write, I learned few things beside writing like, I am not writing to show others, I am writing for myself so I need to be true to myself.Writing is not a pressure for me but it's a way to dump whatever going in mind into diary and sleep peacefully.While writing any incident I actually get to realize my mistakes.It actually helps me plan and monitor my day.When I write what I want in my life, it turns into reality. Words actually have power.What you say to yourself indicates what your future holds.Writing is a way to analyze the past and create future.And biggest of all, I learned to thank for everything I have in my life. I always write a thank you note at the end. ",

            "answer_text": "Turning a so-called setback into a strength. I was born with bilateral cleft lips, meaning that the part below my lips was non-existent when I was born. Fortunately, I underwent a surgery when I was 3 months old, whereby my lips were sewed up properly and I looks normal. This might seem trivial as compared to many other diseases and facial deformities that others have, but it was still something that made me look slightly different from others. My nose was flat, and I had two scars cruising down the bottom of nose to the top of my lips. It never bothered me that I looked different. Until that time when I was in Primary 3, and a boy called me a \u201cgorilla nose\u201d. I remembered being shocked and had no reaction at first, but when I realised what he said in its entirety, I was sad and frustrated. Fortunately, my parents supported me and taught me the power of ignorance. It took a while, but I gradually learnt to ignore the bully and focus on the more important things in life. And interestingly, I started growing an interest in medicine and human anatomy, even at the age of 9. It was then that I decided that I was going to be a plastic surgeon when I grew up, to operate on children like me. It was the decision to turn my cleft lips into a strength that I would say is the greatest accomplishment I had in my life so far. It changed me. From a poor little nobody, characterised by her ugly scars, into one who actively used her cleft lips, in her self-introduction when meeting new people, in a speech about how appearances do not matter and as a form of motivation towards her dream career. I have held onto this dream to become a plastic surgeon since I was 9 years old, and 9 years on, at 18, I am still working towards it. Even when I do get into medical school and finally become a plastic surgeon, my journey would not have ended yet. I will make use of this greatest accomplishment in my life, of changing my perception of my cleft lips, to change the perception of other young children towards their own facial deformities too. Because, appearances do not matter. What matters is your perception of it. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that just growing up in such a privileged life fulfills what I want to achieve in life. And that is to find happiness. Even though I may not be the world\u2019s most famous person or the richest person in the world, just being with my family makes me happy and fortunate. I often ponder about what life is about, and it seems like I can answer that question now. To me, happiness is when your life fulfills your needs. Not wants, but needs. In other words, happiness comes when you feel satisfied and fulfilled. Happiness is a feeling of contentment, that life is just as it should be. Since happiness is when your life fulfills your needs, the next logical question is, \u201cWhat are my needs?\u201dMany have offered to answer this simple yet confusing and complex question. However, I feel that the answer to this question is-family and your loved ones. Although some may think that family is not the most important, I have a reason for my statement. First of all, family provides love, support and comfort in your life. During the most challenging moments in ones\u2019 life, anyone can lend a shoulder for you to cry on, but when a family member looks at you and comforts you, it is probably what you want to have at that moment in life. Overall, I think that my greatest achievement would have to be that I came into this world, not knowing what life is about. But now, I know, and I will cherish the fact that my parents did not coincidently give birth to me for no reason, but they want me to live a meaningful life. As the saying goes, \u201cfamilies are like branches on a tree, we grow in different directions, yet our roots remain as one.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Living life itself is my greatest achievement in life. I was born and brought up in a middle class family with a younger sister.Being a elder one I was supposed to have lots of responsibilities since childhood. I was given a good education from a local private convent till 5th. Then I cleared an entrance exam for my further studies to join a boarding school (NAVODAYA) which is a dream for many students at the age of 10.Even clearing the entrance exam is considered to be the biggest achievement of a child.Parents use to send their children to coaching center with the proxy attendance in schools to train for the exams.I had cleared that exam without any coaching \ud83d\ude0d(You can imagine the scenario of pride). While I continued my studies at boarding school I stayed away from home and never had any idea of the problems of my parents. When I was in 10th I had a ovarian cyst due to which I had lost my blood and was hospitalized for months together and could not attend classes.Some people even say I'm a lucky girl who got rebirth.Still I was successful in clearing my 10th board with distinction. After I got my strength I had another shocking news that My Father had a kidney failure and is been living with a single kidney since birth. When I was in 12th I lost my father and was supposed to take care of the family but never wanted to stop studies and stay back at home. Being from a middle class Indian family where responsibilities are more valued than education I was forced to agree to get married. I argued,quarreled and left home for sometime to convince my family to let me study.They had their own restrictions and gave me 3yrs time to do whatever I want. I'm pursuing my degree with my own amount and also looking at family expenses without any support. It's so easy to live single, but it's really difficult for a single girl to live without any support and with responsibilities I really consider every moment that I live is my achievement.  Well it's me \ud83d\ude0a Beyond all the circumstances, I never stopped being happy. Every moment You live is a chance to change what has happened then. God's plans are bigger than our past. So keep smiling always. Image Source :my gallery By:Bhoomika Basavaraj \ud83d\ude0a ",

There is a soldier, who gave up his life defending mankind against DICTATORS, PERVERTED MILITANCY, and all such evils. There is a Ginny Pig or Rat which gave up its life, while helping invention or discovery of solutions that plague human beings.  What answer can we expect by putting this Question to them. They do not know how big and vast and perpetual is quantum of their BENEFACTORS. All most all of the BENEFACTORS may not know these LIVES ( soldiers and Rats and Pigs) and won't acknowledge them. let us call it ACHIEVEMENT TYPE-I  DID THESE LIVES( SOLDIERS, RATS,PIGS etc) ACHIEVE ANY THING OR WASTED THEIR LIVES ?. Mahatma Gandhi , Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, to name a few,  gave up their lives for a section of the mankind - Gandhi for Indians, Martin for American Blacks, Mandela for South Africans Blacks etc. they are remembered by those groups. GANDHI and MARTIN were killed by people, who did not like them. They lost their lives and their next kin is left high and dry. to the best of my knowledge, gandhi or martin did not say that they achieved some thing for their people. let us call it ACHIEVEMENT-TYPE-II. Ambanis, Bill Gates, LaluPrasad Yadav , so many other in similar format - They ACHIEVED WEALTH for THEMSELVES/THEIR FAMILIES and SOME THING for THE SOCIETY THEY LIVE IN. these people can and always write their very impressive CVs. they are followed well by general public, media, social, political, financial circles.  let us call it ACHIEVEMENT TYPE-III there shall be another category, whose out put is just around their family and friends. let us call it TYPE-IV there is another category, whose out put is just for them selves,  let us call it TYPE-V CRIMINALS IN NIRBHAY CASE AND ALL SCAMSTERS, WHO SWINDLED PUBLIC MONEY AND MADE THEM SELVES NOVA-RICH , OR TORMENTED INNOCENT LIVES - IDI AMIN, HITLER, et. al. which type of achievement are you looking for. IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO BE A NEGATIVE CHARACTER. MAKE SURE YOUR OUT PUT IS LIKELI TO BE A NEUTRAL OR  POSITIVE ALL THE TIME. THAT IT SELF SHALL BE GREAT SERVICE TO HUMANITY. GOD BLESS YOU      ",

            "answer_text": "Warning: These achievements may not be unique to myself, as there would be many fellow Indians out there who would relate with me on many scores. A clich\u00e8 they may seem, but here they are - My top 5 achievements: 1. My Engineering degree 2. My first job 3. My MS degree 4. My marriage 5. My kids Long version of the answer ahead: 1. Engineering degree - I was the first among my generation of the family and the extended family (my Dad's siblings' families) to acquire an engineering degree. Of course, the fact that I'm the eldest among all of my siblings and cousins worked to my advantage. But that's not why it feels like an achievement. It used to feel like an achievement when my Dad would boast to his friends that his elder daughter is an engineer. 2. First job - I had always led a sheltered life at home. Not even a glimpse of the hostel life, as I stayed right at home during college. And then I landed my first job more than 1300 miles away from home. Initially I would cry my eyes out, missing my family for the first few weeks. It was really hard to be completely on my own. But once the home-sickness faded to the background, I managed just fine on my own. I even had a tooth removed, and managed all on my own (although again cried a lot once the adrenaline rush was over). So, yes, it felt like a huge achievement at the time. 3. MS Degree - The first degree ever that I earned and supported on my own (under BITS Pilani's work-collaboration program) while still working on my first job , without an iota of financial aid from my Dad. Felt so proud of myself on my convocation day. 4. My Marriage - I almost got married to a wrong guy - wrong for me, that is. When I started receiving calls after mid-night while I was sleeping after a long tiring day (and the next day was again a working day), with the excuse that it's his so-called right to call me whenever he pleases as my parents had chosen him as my life-partner (I hadn't even met him once), it irked me a lot but I tried to adjust, and kept quiet. But it was too much for me when he started planning too far ahead, on my behalf as well, and suggested that I'd have to leave my job to be a home-maker and spend time with his parents. I'm not suggesting that it's a bad thing to do - to be a home-maker and take care of the in-laws. But, somehow, I couldn't digest the fact that someone whom I had not even met once, and was not even engaged to, had the gall to do all this planning of my life, on his own, according to his whims, without even trying to know how I would feel about that. So, I put my foot down with my parents (Thank God for them being so understanding and undemanding) and got myself out of that would-be-disaster marriage. Today, I'm a full-time working mother of two kids, and have an awesome life-partner (again, chosen by my parents), and full support of my in-laws. 5. Kids - Do I need to explain this one? Motherhood would be the biggest achievement for any woman, I feel. ",

            "answer_text": "I am quite proud of what I achieved in my life given my age (23). I've been a top student from my first day in school till the last one.I ranked fifth on the whole country in high school, and hence earned 2 fully-funded scholarships to Kuwait university, which most expats have no hope of enrolling into. Not only that but one of these scholarships actually paid me to study in university, so I took up that one.By the age of 13 I knew the Quran (holy book of Islam) by heart. And even though I'm no longer a Muslim, the nights I spent memorizing hundreds of pages are still something I'm very proud of. I was tested on 200 pages fully in one competition. And we're not talking about regular memorizing where you can paraphrase what you remember, no we're talking about reciting lines exactly as they are written. I remember the times I broke down completely and cried that I can't do it because my mind will explode but I kept going regardless. And not only that I scored very high and got a sum of money no kid my age would dream of as a reward.I got my bachelor's degree in English Literature and Translation with a high GPA of 3.8 and was given an \u201chonor\" appreciation degree.Once I graduated, I immediately got a job that pays more than the average fresh graduate in Kuwait.I have enough savings to live for months without working, which I'd say is rare for someone my age.I translated projects on http://freelancer.com and translated a ten-page article that was published and sold for money. I was also offered to actually write for money (but the feild wasn't suitable for me, so we didn't go through with it).I ranked very high in a translation competition on \u201ctranslators without borders\u201d that I was invited to their elite group that translates sensitive topics. And I have actually finished several projects with them since then.I work at a legal firm as an assistant, and I'm trusted enough to translate the documents around the office that don't need an official stamp.My English improved drastically in a short amount of time. I even scored 7.5 in the IELTS test as proof of my proficiency in English.On the personal level: I was able to marry the person I love against my parents\u2019 wish yet still managed to maintain a strong relationship with them, in fact even stronger than before.I managed to beat an eating disorder (albeit mild) and return to normal. And I'm currently still fighting my personality disorder with every weapon I have. The fact that I never submitted to any suicidal thoughts or given up is an accomplishment in my eyes.I worked as a teacher for 2 years while I was a student. And to my great happiness I had little girls come up to me and say that they very touched and feel positively influenced by my advice and guidance. And to me that means the world.I got an official certificate to teach Quran when I was 15 and have taught countless people since that time. And even though I'm not a Muslim, I have no issue teaching someone who feels that learning how to recite Quran properly will enhance their quality of life.Lastly, I managed to get comments like this: Be it when I taught, translated, wrote, or went to depth about my mental condition, I've always had one goal in mind. I live for it and will die for it. And that is influencing people's thinking and leaving a good mark in their minds. I believe that the best investment is the investment in a person's brain. And if I could get one person to know a mental condition better, or read a translated book and learn from it, or read my answers and learn something new, then I reached my goal and will keep going. I hope that got people to know me just a little better since people seemed to think my life revolves around my husband. ",

            "answer_text": "Helping the people I care about answer one or several of their three fundamental needs. Doing this has helped me answer mine. Three fundamental needs have been driving human behavior for thousands of years: control, connection and consistency. Without them, survival and reproduction are impossible. Evolution has ensured that those of our distant ancestors who answered those needs lived long enough to have and raise children. But evolution is slow. That\u2019s why our ancestors\u2019 three fundamental needs are still with us today. Directly or indirectly, they drive everything we think, say and do. Our needs for control, connection and consistency express themselves in infinite ways in a world that has become less physically threatening but more complex and mentally challenging. Understanding and satisfying those three needs, both in yourself and in others, is key to \u2018surviving\u2019 in a modern sense. This means navigating the opportunities and threats of today\u2019s world, communicating and influencing effectively, and achieving what you want for yourself and your children. Here\u2019s a closer look at those three fundamental needs: >>> OUR NEED TO FEEL IN CONTROL. This explains our attraction to things like knowledge, food, shelter, freedom, choice, power, possessions, contracts, insurance, mastery and safety. But it also explains our attraction to risk taking, fortune telling and novelty, all of which are opportunities to test or improve our control. On the other hand, losing control over our life or loss of any kind, whether real or potential, is something we avoid and act on. >>>> OUR NEED FOR CONNECTION There is very little, including reproduction, that we can achieve alone. Evolution has hardwired us to assume we can achieve much more by collaborating with others and being sociable (watch how newborn babies instinctively attract attention, for instance). As groups we can produce more food, build safer shelters and defend each other. Sex is one of the most obvious manifestations of our need to connect. It is evolution\u2019s way of making reproduction (and therefore survival of the species) appealing. But we also need to feel emotionally connected to the world around us, to what we do in it, to what things mean, to who we are and to who we might become. That\u2019s why stories, not facts and numbers, resonate so deeply with us. On the other hand, isolation or exclusion, whether real or potential, are forms of disconnection we instinctively fear and may go to extremes to avoid. >>> OUR NEED FOR CONSISTENCY. This need supports the first two. How do we spot threats to our control and connections? How do we spot opportunities to test and improve them? By constantly checking our surroundings for breaks in the consistencies we know about. Consciously or not, we can\u2019t refrain from filling gaps, spotting patterns, finding or inventing explanations, drawing conclusions, identifying truths and learning. The world might seem to be in a turmoil of change, but most of life is consistent. We know from observation and learning that the same causes have the same effects and that reality in its millions of tiny details\u2014including our own thoughts, actions and identity\u2014is mostly consistent with our expectations and remains so from one timeframe to the next. This means, crucially, that anything that we know to be consistent can be safely ignored in most cases. This in turn frees up our mind to pay attention to inconsistencies, which signal either threats to our control and connections or opportunities to improve them. ",

            "answer_text": "With my own efforts I healed serious illness (if fact - three) that is considered incurable. It were efforts of long years, including work&study in medicine until I understood mechanism and found effective working method. It was a very big breakthrough in my life.Studied from various POV and discovered many things how Left and Right Brain Hemispheres work. It is my all life fundamental research and project which led me to series of other achievements and discoveries in completely different directly unrelated fields. I consider this as my most important, unique discovery and impact.First in my country and rare in the World I started unique talk radio show, almost the same as famous Art Bell's show. It was my own idea, but later after I found Art Bell's show I gained much more courage from his example.Learned 13 languages, but now actively use only 5 or 6.Autodidacticly studied in 5 universities with completely different areas of science. Now I use all this knowledge in my seminars and in practice.Studied most of the World religions and some myhologies. This impacted me and some my pupils fundamentally.Indirectly created web&media company \"Terra Media\". Owners consider me as father of this company.Blindly reinvented rotor or turbosail ship (Rotor ship) or Magnus Effect. It was my own original idea without knowing that this already exist. At the beginning I was criticised by scientists, but year later I found that Anton Flettner invented this in 1922, NASA experimented with it, Alcyone - Jacques Cousteau used such Turbosail Ship, (Category:Flettner rotor ships), shipyards make such big ships. This is considered as sail of the future ships.After long years of study and effort found specific wisdom topic which calmed my mind from negativity. All this changed through relatively short few years period. Later impacted my relationships with relatives, friends and all people. It became a best selling seminar for heads of organisations.Started small local TED version (TEDAS) in my country just months before TEDx (the same idea) was officially started 2008. This idea was in the air. Later one part of our team created TEDxVilnius and other part created \"A\u0161Lietuvai\".First started floating Isolation tanks center (SPA type) as a business in my country. After my consultation Russian company created network of centers \u0424\u043b\u043e\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433 \u0432 \u0441\u0435\u0442\u0438 \u0444\u043b\u043e\u0430\u0442-\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u042d\u043c\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043e \u0432 \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0435!Made research about most dating systems and traditions. Even started my own modern dating system for short period. My personal introductions created at least 6 families and many children were born there.Created brand names to architectural projects: \"Oaz\u0117\" (Kaunas), \"Grasas\" (Vilnius).Started national crowdsourcing ideas campaign collecting thousands of ideas for country's problem-solving. Later this grew to think tank format. (A\u0161Lietuvai: futurologinis think tank'as). This is an ongoing project. I am it's CEO.With a team of professionals participated in rewriting of country's Constitution. Personally for me it was very interesting and instructive experience.Started teachings, conferences and groups for men/males. Ongoing project.Taught self development seminar programs that impacted tens of thousands of adults. Feedback is very good till today (Atsiliepimai)Now I write a book about male&female relationship psychology.I have 3 children. Third one born in April 2015",

However , when we are able to do something new and achieve success at the same time , the feeling is more rewarding . I have achieved something that I never hoped of achieving . I am a student . After clearing my class 10 exam , I started to grow interest towards film making \u2026 slowly I even started involving myself in some small projects . It was going on quite well . However , I was not very serious about it . In November last year , inspired by our PMs words against food wastage , i decided to make a documentary on it . We had no prior experience except in some minor projects . I gathered a team , comprising of my friends at school and started planning on it . Initially it was tough . Trying to synchronize everything was difficult . The level of details of the entire shoot which had to be addressed was enough to make someone mad . We had limited equipment and our technical knowhow was also not that great . Still we decided to proceed . It felt great . The urge to do something new was enough to make us go forward . Then the shooting began . I was the director of the short film . The shooting spanned over a period of two weeks and the editing part took another one week . We finally came up with a 8 min long documentary . Everyone was happy with what they had done . This was an achievement in itself but little did we know then about what more was about to come . I came to know about a short film competition that was arranged in a school fest in our city . I thought that I should submit my project . I did what I had planned . I did not harbour any hope of winning anything there . On the day the results were scheduled to be declared , I was called by the judge I.e. the person who had judged my short film . I went to him . There I received the biggest surprise of my life till now . The judge who is in fact a renowned short film director gave me an offer to work with him in his upcoming project ( I have not yet thought about it seriously though ). And guess what , we won the first prize . Here is the link to my short film on food wastage :  And here is the prize received by me :  Here is the picture of us shooting a scene ( I am not in the picture )  Thus , this is what I have achieved . To be honest , I have developed a whole new respect for all the film directors out there . I have developed a passion towards this field and right now working on two different projects . I want to pursue it as my passion but not my profession . The taste of success is such that one will crave to indulge in it day in and day out \u2026.. ",

            "answer_text": "This happened around 6 years ago when I was studying in the 9th standard. One fine day, I was on my way to school. As the road to my school was blocked due to construction work, I had to take diversion and continue. I continued to cycle, in a completely new route, which I had never been through. The road was dreadfully deserted and covered with thick bushes on both sides of the road. I suddenly found some brownish thing at a random place. Closely looking, a gunny bag caught my attention which was inside one of those bushes. Despite fear, I went near the bag and opened the bag with confidence. OMG!! My heart skipped a beat on seeing the sight. There was a huge sum of money inside.  The poor me thought of buying lays chips with that. But was afraid to the core and something insisted me not to take even a rupee from the money. So, I thought of informing to the Police but was scared of Police. I somehow gained courage and went into the police station which was very close to my school and narrated the whole story to the police. First they laughed at me, but somehow agreed to come with me to that place. We reached the place and they were stunned by seeing the gunny bag full of money and they praised me. Higher police officials applauded me. They asked me if I wanted anything. I told them that my teacher punishes me if I ever go late to school and asked them to narrate the incident to my teacher so that she doesn't punish me. A policeman followed my bicycle and we reached the school. He narrated the whole thing to the teacher. She along with my classmates praised me immensely for my act. From that day, everyone in the school started respecting me. Next day, an article in the news paper was published about me. I also received an invitation from the district collector for a small meet. I met him and he praised me for my bravery and congratuled me. Later, I had a chance to meet the state Governor and I was said that I was about to receive a medal during the independence day celebrations. I was on cloud nine. On the D day, I reached the headquarters of my state ( Chennai) and the independence day celebrations started. My heart was jumping and pumping with joy. I was sitting in the middle row among few policemen, ministers etc. I was like a tiny flower in a sugercane field. The awards distribution function had started and I was waiting eagerly for my name to be called. My ears were adhered to the speaker. I was thinking of my friends who will be watching me on Television and I started feeling proud. I even had a plan to take a photo with governor and place it in the show case. !! Beeeeeeeeeeeppppp!! I heard a sound suddenly. Thought it was intereference in the mic. Again !!! Beeeeeeeeppppp!!! Aww\u2026 That sound was so disturbing. Suddenly I got a hit on my back. It was my mom waking me up to switch off the alarm. It was then I realised that I had some good time dreaming about achievements. Why should only real achievers have all the fun haan? We(budding achievers) can also have fun!!! Cheer up!! ",

            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t say this is my biggest achievement, but I think it\u2019s worth sharing. In highschool i was an all-state quarterback for my football team. I broke just about every record, lead my team the farthest it had gone in 10 years, and not trying to brag, but I was doing pretty darn good. After all, I was the best quarterback in the state. I was all-state, 1st team all district, and 2nd team all conference selection. I broke just about all the career passing records, and just about all the season records. Football was everything to me. My dad previously played in the NFL for 15 years, and grew up loving the sport and playing my whole life, being around locker rooms and just loving every part about it. In my time in highschool, I was happy in the present, but I was just so excited to see what the future had in store for me. After the games and before the games highschool coaches would always go up to me telling me how good I was, taking their time to talk to me. I thought I had it going for me. The previous year I got a call from Mizzou, and so I knew that they had interest. Southeast Missouri State also had interest. I knew I was doing well. The numbers said so, coaches said so, and my accomplishments were unlike any other quarterback in the state. After my senior year I was expecting to get, at the least, 1 offer to play in college. You wouldn\u2019t believe the lack of interest all colleges had for me after senior year was done with. Days go by, and I get no calls. And what hurt most was getting no offers. I\u2019m waiting for my phone to ring from at least one coach to offer me any type of scholarship so I can go play for them and go to school. But get nothing. 2 of my high school buddies who were good athletes like I was got a great amount of scholarships to play. And I got none. I was shocked, discouraged, and a little bit scared. I was also resentful, and pissed off that no one took any recognition into what I had done and how hard I had worked. I asked myself over and over: what would I have had to do that I didn\u2019t already do to get 1 single offer? The worst part was this is what I loved most and what I was best at at the time. I ended up getting a couple of walk-on offers, but nothing seemed real at this point, and still got no actual scholarship. To this day I can\u2019t believe I did not get one single scholarship to play football and I will always know how wrong the college coaches were. I decided I wasn\u2019t going to play. The head coach called me into his room, shocked and surprised that I wasn\u2019t going to play at the next level. I told him I felt discouraged because no one offered me. He said it didn\u2019t matter, I needed to go prove myself. He was right, but in my head I didn\u2019t know how I would do this when nobody really gave me a fair shake in the first place. I was pissed off, resentful, and done with all of it. My whole goal was to make it to the NFL. And I knew I had little to no chance doing this with literally no college wanting me. After the senior season was over I quit. Who knows what I would have done in college? But I never had gotten a fair shake in the first place. If the colleges don\u2019t want me, then they sure as hell did not deserve me. ",

            "answer_text": "Short Answer - The courage to fail..!!! Detailed Answer - I have never hesitated to try new things or take a difficult path. My understanding of life is to explore as much as possible. At some point in your life you will find it worth taking those risks or loses or victories. I love this quote by Steve jobs, \u201cYou can never connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backward\u201d. I am 25 years now and I can confidently say that I have at least basic experience in different fields that most people wouldn\u2019t even think of it as a career.I have worked in a startup where I had to develop a complete module (Frontend to Backend) as a fresher.I have worked in BPO.I have worked in MNC and enjoyed their benifits and a software engineer\u2019s life (How our parents would imagine).I have riased 3 startups and learned a lot. (Selling saplings online, Catering, Idly/Dosa batter selling).I have tutored school students as well as corporate people.I have done freelancing work.I read a lot and continue to do it.EDIT: I started a YouTube channel UnboxStartups. Exploring the content creator side of me ;-) Do subscribe if you liked my videos. I am 27 now and added 2 more years of IT experience in my career. I am feeling more mature in terms of making decisions and handling the situations. I know a lot of people who will laugh at this list as they have a huge list of achievements. But I don\u2019t consider these as my significant achievement but my courage to take risks and not afraid of failing is my significant achievement. ",

            "answer_text": "Well - whatever it was, it was shortlived! I performed my drag ballerina act, Madame Galina, for troops in Iraq. For three reasons: Money, publicity and lust. I was a risk act, to say the least - the squaddies expected to see straight stand up, football managers or all singing/all dancing glamour models. Not a sixteen stone drag ballerina getting their colonel onstage and checking for waggle in his under-feathers. I was last on the bill - and not because I was \u2018headlining\u2019, either. It was because the other comedians refused to go on after me and mop up \u2018when the carnage has been and gone.\u2019 Before the first show in the wilds of Iraq, I was so terrified I\u2019d get canned off, I had a serious urge to climb the wire and flee into the desert. The audience was all Royal Marines and 2Para. The toughest of tough crowds. The act before me lost his thread and said to give him a minute. Immediately and in perfect synch, the Royal Marines chanted \u2018\u202659, 58, 57\u2026\u2019 The act said, \u2018Yes, we\u2019ve heard you Marines do everything together. Makes you too tired to be of any use in warfare, but at least when you get captured you\u2019re au fait with gay rape\u2026\u2019 Which, you can imagine, was the end of him. I was up, prematurely, so went onstage on still wearing my regulation body armour over my tutu. Faces all turned to me reading WTF? I made a Brigadier, sitting centre front, help with my body armour. A frazzled, a push me, pull you with the Velcro fastenings, getting his rank wrong with each comment. Major, Akela, Arch-deaconess, etc. Ending in a pratt fall with the Brigadier pinned beneath betutu\u2019d me. The squaddies bellowed. And they continued with me - sounding at times like a laughter track. Crowning achievement. But then we came to the volunteers from the audience part of my act. Where I\u2019d been advised to target the officers. Which I duly did. Meanwhile, the Royal Marines pushed onstage the notorious huge and morose Commando, Stacks. Six feet two; baby of face, blue of eye, rocky of outcrop. Stacks previously had told me not to get him onstage to join in with my set. Though he had it thus: \u2018Your tiddle-iddle-thud in your frock of many doilies.\u2019 Adding, \u2018You are to leave me unmolested.\u2019 I was doing swan\u2019s wings, staring up at him, he was at ease, looking his most baleful. I looked up at him. He looked down at me. I was clearly at a loss and atmosphere was leaking from the venue. So\u2026 I cupped his genitals, saying, \u2018We\u2019re in a dry camp, but here\u2019s some rising damp.\u2019 He hoisted me over his shoulder and ran with me out of the venue. He was about to stuff me in the hull of a tank when one of his fellow Commandos pointed out the journalist standing by with a camera. Stacks was disciplined for assaulting a civilian (me!) and made to clean the windows of HQ with a cotton bud. He asked for a second cotton bud and came to find me\u2026 I\u2019d like to say that with my one cotton bud leaving those HQ windows completely clean and smear-free was a crowning achievement. But I\u2019d be lying.  ",

            "answer_text": "For many it\u2019s some exam or award or interview or competition. For me it\u2019s quite different. 9th standard. Annual Day Function of our school. Like every annual day it was nothing different. Started with awards function for academics and extra curricular activities. All awards were done for the day. Except for the one- Ideal Student Award. It is always in the last. I had submitted my name with whatever necessary documents. Few others had also submitted their names. It\u2019s ritual that chief guest announces and felicitates the student for this award. Chief guest came. Opened up the envelope. Announced the name. But for whatever reasons nobody could listen the name except for him and those who were on stage. Till now you must have guessed who the boy is. Well, that is quite obvious. Yes that is me. But that\u2019s is not the achievement I am talking about. I have already said it\u2019s not something award or competition or something similar. My achievement is what happened after that. As I said only those who were on stage had heard what was the name, our principal, who was on the other side of the stage heard it and she couldn\u2019t control herself after the chief guest\u2019s failed attempts to announce the name. She ran fast from the other side of the stage and grabbed the mic. And announced, \u201cAnd the Ideal Student Award goes to Anand Vyavahare. I would like his parents to come up on stage.\u201d  What is achievement in that, you ask? Well it was not me getting the best award of our school. It was the way our principal had announced my name. She looked happy. I could clearly see the satisfaction on her face. I had my mom and my sister accompanied me on stage. There were all guests, senior teachers, me, my mom, and my sister. But guess what? Who were the happiest?- It was my teachers. I could clearly see it in their eyes, they were proud of me. As if I had achieved a biggest feat in my life. As if I had lived up to their expectations. As if I was their son\u2026 All of my teachers were happier than my mom and my sister. After the annual day, everyone was congratulating me for the award. But it was my teachers who would tell everyone how happy they were that I got the award, how good of a student I was and how I deserved it, even to my mom. And believe me I had never felt so happy, not even when I was receiving the award.  To me this is the best kind of achievement. Making your teachers proud. No matter what you do, your parents will always be proud of you. But it\u2019s always your teachers who would be fair and never be biased. They would always tell you what is right for you no matter how hard it may sound. No matter who would stop supporting you, they will always be there to guide you. So it is only when you can make them proud of you, would be the greatest gift you can give to them. The biggest achievement you can ever get!!! I always feel it\u2019s never about awards, gifts. It is about these small things. I don\u2019t even remember how the trophy looked like, how much money I received, who were the guests, what I was wearing that day or how I looked. Not even how much my mom was happy. All I remember is how my teachers were happy and were proud of me and their love for me\u2026 Yes this was my biggest achievement. And I am proud of it. ",

            "answer_text": "My children. I know it would be a totally expected response to such a question. But, there are quite a few reasons for it. My wife. If I had not married my high school sweet-heart who has been my best friend, my confidant, my teacher, my biggest admirer and, of course, mother of my two children, I couldn\u2019t have answered it this way.My father. He taught me so many valuable lessons - sure, at times, his little philosophical rants became a bit too much, but I use his quotes all the time - which over all these decades have become profound - including a few, off the wall quotes like \u201cSon, if you don\u2019t FOcus you f**k-us\u201d!My friends. All of them who put up with me for years (decades) and listened, gave me feedback and at times smacked the heck out of me.Finally myself. Even in my fifties, I am not afraid of taking any risks - calculated risks of course. For example, I wouldn\u2019t quit my job and move to the Himalayas in search of truth. But, if it developing a career in a different industry, adapting a different lifestyle for health, or working extra hard to learn and present in a different language, or learning to ski in my mid-thirties so I can motivate/encourage/accompany my kids on ski trips, I am always up for it. Leading by example that passion, commitment and dedication is the only way to ensure and celebrate success is in my DNA. As my father would say, \u201cAnything worth doing is worth doing well!\u201dAnd, finally, having compassion so that you don\u2019t cross that thin line between confidence and arrogance, value of anything versus price and using things and loving people versus the other way around - is the only way to leave a legacy behind for their next generation.And, from what my children have seen so far (knock on wood) they are reflecting these qualities very well. I wish and pray to God that they continue to do so and live long to write a similar opinion. ",

            "answer_text": "This mignt not be the answer you might expect, but you'll surely find it interesting. It's out of my personal life experiences. Read till the end to know how it changed my life. Leaving shittiest people that you thought were your besties. If your thinking and character doesn't align with your so-believed-friends, leave them and move on. Find those who suits your mental health and encourages in doing stuff, not in going for another round of weed or hukka, but in things that'll make you better as a person. I promise you, you'll be amazed, rather shockrd i guess, to see a person that has same mind set as you. He may be a person you thought- \u201cvo bacche log hai\u201d. But that person has more to offer you than your bhai/friend who smokes & drinks thinking it's cool and makes him look swaggy. Remember, you always have the choice to leave people behind who are dragging you down. It's not a betrayal to friendship. It's not friendship at all if that's HOLDING YOU FROM GROWING INTO SOMETHING BIG & MEANINGFUL. We often find it tough in the beginning when you start to leave them. You'll be on your own when everyone has their GANG to show-off around your school/college. But TRUST ME! YOU'LL LEARN A LOT BY BEING ON THE OTHER SIDE. JUST BY WALKING ON YOUR OWN ON THE CAMPU, YOUR CONFIDENCE AND SELF BELIEF WILL BE ROCKETED. If you are able to do that, Congrats! you've changed and has the courage to grow into something big. Now it's time to make friends that help you become big. When you find them, Welcome to the 1% club. You are going to change the world into a better place. It's all from my personal experience. To say it, I've a set of friends in beginning of my Engineering. We were the gang with swag that no other had. I liked it pretty much, Gangs-Wars-Hype, Weed, Alcohol etc etc. But I'm seeing where the things were going. But I wasn't able to do anything about it. I'm just going with the flow. To make me realise or stop and teach me that \u201cit's my life, I have to take decisions, I shouldn't go with the flow\", GOD had to intervene. I'm met with a terrible accident- a head injury. Out on the bed for 3 months. It was my calling to realise that it's not what i want in my life. Eventually, after a lot of drama I'm finally free from all that shit. Now, I've successfully graduated with 7.5 CGPA. Got admits from Universities abroad and good girl, good life. Oh you want to know what happend to my so-called-swaggy friends? Most of them were suspended for some time. Then they were subject to detention as they weren't able to satisfy the required credits to pass on to next year. So some dropped out of college( & caught the routine line- I'm working on my startup). And rest were my juniors, cuss they had to complete the subjects to pass onto next year. See on how different side of the story I am? LEAVE those who aren't good for you. You'll see a drastic change in your life. ",

            "answer_text": "Running a 10 KM mini-marathon  This might not sound a big deal to some people, so first I\u2019ll tell you something about me. You remember that guy from school who used to faint during morning assemblies, I\u2019m that guy. I was lanky, underweight, and hence fainting during school assemblies was my thing. Fast forward to January 2020 and I decided to run a mini-marathon. I had 20 days to prepare for the marathon. The first day of practice and I was panting hard after running only 1.5 KM. I got better over these 20 days but I was never able to finish running 10 KM. And mind you I\u2019m still thin so obviously nobody (including my closest friends) had thought that I\u2019d be able to finish the marathon. 23rd February 2020 This was the day of the marathon (my 1st time ever). I woke up around 3.30 AM that day (had slept at 12.30 AM after a crazy game of Monopoly Deal). We had to catch a bus at 4.00 AM from my college campus to go to Kozhikode beach which was the starting point of the marathon. The marathon started at 6.30 AM, and I had a simple plan - run continuously for 30 minutes then for the next 20 minutes and then for 20 more minutes. But as I reached the 3.5 KM mark in 20 minutes I was dead, I was panting heavily and I sat down on the road and took a few sips of mineral water. After this, I decided to just walk for some distance and see what happens. I walked for 500 meters and then seeing the 4 KM mark I decided that well let's do this. Instead of focusing on the remaining 6 KM, I decided to take it 1 KM at a time. I shifted from walking to speed walking then jogging then again walking, speed walking followed by jogging. I continued doing this for some time, and then I got a major boost when I got a tetra pack of ORS liquid being served on the route by the organizers. ORS helped me gain my composure back then I started running again followed by speed walking and jogging and this continued. I took almost 53 minutes to reach 7.5 KM mark. The rest 2.5 KM I covered in mere 14 minutes. So in total, I completed the 10 KM marathon in 67 minutes and believe me from whatever little practice I had done although I had never run 10 KM I roughly had an idea that I would require at least 75 minutes to complete the marathon but well I would say that it was just amazing. Now that I look back at the marathon I imagine that what if I had given up at 3.5 KM. I'm glad that I did not give up. This marathon taught me a few things - First being that before the starting of the marathon there were many of my classmates (along with a friend of mine) who were making fun of me thinking that how could I run 10 KM but after completing the marathon (I finished the marathon earlier than all of these classmates of mine) I realized that I've reached a level of maturity in my life where external negative factors or comments hardly have any effect on what I want to achieve. I've become a more self-confident guy who knows how to get things done and done right too.Second learning for me was that one should never judge others because you never know what that person is capable of achieving. My friend made this mistake, he underestimated me but instead, I ended up finishing the marathon 8 minutes before him (and more than 100 people finished the marathon after me and before he could complete it).Third learning would be how to pace things in life the way I paced my marathon run.Fourth, this not actually learning but a realization kind of, so when these classmates of mine realized that I finished the marathon before them I did not say anything to them, I just gave them a thumbs up when they were appreciating me, so yes I've become mature enough to not let any sort of success go to my head and well that is good news.After crossing the finish line I let a sigh of relief, I unplugged my earphones (was listening to songs throughout the run), sat down and clicked a picture of the medal I received. This is an experience I'll never forget. Thank you for reading. Bye. ",

Then this question made me kind of depressed. What the hell have I achieved? I don\u2019t have any children, I haven\u2019t married anyone, I haven\u2019t run for office,, won any medals, prizes, I\u2019m not a celebrity, movie star, broken any world records. I am not a billionaire (nor millionaire). I haven\u2019t scaled the Himalayas in search of the yeti, nor the American Northwest looking for Bigfoot. I don\u2019t even have a sleazy calendar or website. Getting a first tattoo at 46 is funny, at best. I then realize my only worthy achievement. Staying alive. I should\u2019ve been dead decades ago. Death has it in for me, and he wants me bad. Crazies trying to run me over, child molesters wanting to give me a ride, lightning bolts narrowly missing me, near fatal bicycle accidents, numerous instances of random shootings only feet away from me, flying discus narrowly missing me, weird disease leaving me unable to swallow even fluids, a few savage beatings. How did I survive? Luck, willpower, too dumb to die? O  h, that angel of death will get me eventually, no doubts but so far he\u2019s had an issue with my zig zagging. ",

I pursued my education with my job. Now I have the full responsibility of my family on me and I am helpless. Money is now just a number for me, I am not rich but I am satisfied with it. Every 1st of the month my account balance goes up and then decreases by the end of it. I usually don't care about it at all. I separate my investments and saving initially and then spend whatever and wherever I want. Can we call it something biggest achievement? For some of you, it may be nothing and for some, it may be. Well, it's for me its nothing. Yes, money, house, and a good lifestyle is too important and is something everyone is working their ass off. but for me, The biggest life achievement I have gained is \u201cMy Peace of Mind\u201d. Fortunately, I have somewhere achieved it this year as a blessing, and no one can disturb it. I think I have achieved something that is really and really important for this human generation. Humans have been literally playing with their brains and made their life miserable. I don't even give a fuck whether I have something or not. I celebrate my existence and the only thing I know to keep this body alive is food. May be 3 meals a day and anyone can work for that. It's just a bullshit myth that you even have to earn and work hard for that. Here I am talking about a hypothetical extreme situation, I know we have to earn to have good food, and it's not easy. But you know we humans are the one who has made it hard for the others. We are just like every other creature on this earth. Everyone works and arrange for their meal. Yes, we are gifted with super intelligence and that makes us superior by which we have made human life most comfortable ever it could be. We can proudly say we are the most comfortable generation that has ever lived on this earth. But can we claim we are happy, calm, peaceful as well? I am glad to have this calm state of mind. Nothing is more important for me than my existence. I do not panic for my problems, either I look beyond it and think for the worst-case scenario. Does it take my life? if no, what are the practical solutions to it? Sometimes there could be many solutions and sometimes acceptance could be the only solution. Believe in your karma and welcome your life phases. Never give control of your happiness and state of mind. Just go with the flow \u2014 \u201cAnuugacchatu Pravaha\u201d - Nikhil ",

I wish I could elaborate but I\u2019m not one for pouring my woes out on social media to get sympathy. Sympathy is something I hate. So I will not elaborate. But I was branded a failure at several points in my life. In the eyes of the world, I had failed in every role - a student, a professional, a daughter, a sister, a woman. People predicted that I\u2019m on a spiral pathway hurtling towards doom. I refused to give up\u2026 hanging in there by a thread of hope that everything will be alright, refusing to let the pellets of insults being thrown at me to affect me. And it paid off. After a while, the insults stopped\u2026 after they realized that it wasn\u2019t affecting me. I was left as an imminent failure. They probably expected me to let go of that thread I was holding on to any minute. But I held on. After the insults had stopped, I started to heal. Slowly but constantly. Not even once did I stop smiling right back at life and at the very people who left me in that state. There was just one mantra that kept on repeating in my head - EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE ALRIGHT. And that is exactly what happened. Today, I am in a very happy place. I am loved and cherished and I have never been happier. I knew that being sad and showing the world that I\u2019m sad will only attract more negativity. I had had enough of that. I made smiling through my woes a habit. I rarely tell anyone about whatever has happened to me on my journey. And the people who know have told me the same thing\u2026 that it\u2019s a wonder I\u2019m still smiling :) If survival isn\u2019t something to be proud of, I don\u2019t know what is. ",

            "answer_text": "On my way to medical school, I went to visit my college roommate who had secured a job at a newspaper through a friend of my family. She gave a dinner party for me to thank me and I was sitting next to the NBC affiliate\u2019s news director. Evidently, he loved to fill his newsroom with good looking women and very few and only necessary men. His producer was going back to college and he wanted me to replace her. He asked me if I would be interested. I laughed. I told him the only time I\u2019d been in a television studio was for Captain Kangaroo when I was just a little girl. Besides, I was going to medical school. He continued to pester me throughout the night and then started calling me the next day. I relented and agreed to send him my resume when I returned home. He asked if I would just take the opportunity to visit the station while I was still in town. I agreed, again. Our appointment was conveniently set up just in time to watch the news live from the control room. I was transported into a different world. I fell in love the minute the first segment started\u2026 With the news, not him. Like many men, the minute he have what he wanted, he did not want it as much anymore. It was very frustrating and I was giving up my life\u2019s dream track for a $12,000 job in one of the nation smallest markets. (To put that in perspective for you\u2026 Television stations are rated by the population and area that they cover. Currently, there are 216 markets and the population has grown since 1986 when I took my job. Back when I got the job, my station was ranked 156th And I believe there were only 167 markets.) Market size did not bother me because I was there to learn about the career I had fallen in love with and wanted to pursue for the rest of my life. I came from a newspaper background. I used to enjoy going in during the summers and writing cut lines (The quotes under pictures) and the obituaries. (When they only let you write two things, you learn to enjoy both of them.) I asked t advice of the family friend who supplied my roommate with a job at his newest acquisition and he was excited and solidly behind me. Then I went to my father, who always thought I could do anything I wanted to do. He did not ask about medical school or anything else. He simply encouraged me to do it\u2026 if that\u2019s what I wanted. He even offered to pay to move me there\u2026 Saying that would give me a strong foothold since it was a small market and the station probably didn\u2019t have much money to put towards moving expenses for a new producer. I did it. Not only that, but I got the job. The old producer offered to stay for two weeks to train me, but after watching her do one show that quickly circled the drain , I think her and told her to go on to college. The administration was astounded as were the anchors, but I assured them that I could do the basics and if I learned her bad habits\u2026 They would become my own. I wanted a fresh start and I had done my homework. I was a fast learner and I would not let them down. I did not let them down and from the first day I walked in there to start my job I worked 24/7, was always at the station and forgot completely about any social life\u2026 basically became invaluable. It only took me 18 months to move to Texas\u2019 premiere communications company\u2026 The one where everyone wanted to be working. I stayed with them for the rest of my career, moving to several of their stations. From day one\u2026 It took me 5 years to become the country\u2019s youngest executive news producer in a large market in the United States. I think anyone can accomplish something like this. However, when you\u2019re dealing with television markets\u2026 You have to be willing to move anywhere at anytime and get paid what they\u2019re willing to pay you\u2026 Knowing that one day it will all pay off. Unfortunately, you will now more likely than not find newsrooms full of people who started there as interns and will spend their entire careers at the same station. I recommend that you move as often as possible, especially if you work behind the scenes or as a reporter. It now only brings fresh ideas to the market, but you will learn more and make more money. My message to producers out there\u2026 remain a producer, even when you are a great one. There was a national conversation about the fact that once a news producer became really good at his/her job\u2026 they would get promoted\u2026 taking them completely off line. There are too few good producers. Stay in your bull pen. You can live anywhere you want every 18 months to 2 years and keep winning awards. Not only that, you will never be taken off overtime like you will when you get bumped up to the executive branch! You will be invaluable and, hopefully, treated like the rare gem you are. ",

            "answer_text": "To know my biggest achievement, I would recommend you to read this first.  TW: rape and sexual abuse \u201cHis weight on my body woke me up. I was 8, and while other relatives were attending a wedding, he\u2019d broken into the house I was sleeping in. When I opened my eyes, he was on top of me. He was raping me. I was absolutely still. My eyes were open, and I was completely numb. I didn\u2019t make a sound. He was my 35-year-old uncle, a distant relative. He ran out after. When I tried to pee, I felt an immense amount of pain. I bled profusely; my hymen had torn. I managed to wash my vagina, hands and face and went back to bed. I lay there still, and couldn\u2019t sleep the entire night. I couldn\u2019t comprehend what had happened. I spoke to no one about it; I\u2019d never been so scared. I never saw him after that, but the trauma didn\u2019t end there. After school, I\u2019d go to a neighbour\u2019s house for lunch. Once, when his parents weren\u2019t home, he called his friends over. They undressed me and masturbated on me. This went on for 4 months. One of them fingered me so hard that I bled. I was lost; I thought showering would make things better. So every time it happened, I\u2019d shower, hoping to \u2018clean\u2019 their dirt off me. I was disgusted\u2013 clueless, but disgusted. I still told no one. On my 13th birthday, 2 cousins groped me. I screamed at that time, but they escaped. I kept quiet about it, thinking I\u2019ll be blamed. For the next few years, I felt depressed and cried all the time. I couldn\u2019t sleep at night; I\u2019d have palpitations and nightmares. To cope, I started smoking and drinking. It felt like there was no end to the attacks because the groping went on till I was 17, from relatives and friends. But the drinking led to a fibroid in my breast, and that\u2019s when my parents started controlling where I went. Sometimes, I\u2019d pack my bags and stay with my friend. Being with her helped\u2013 but I couldn\u2019t tell her either. A few months later, when I started working at an aviation company, my CEO tried fingering me when I refused to sleep with him. I pushed him hard against the wall and ran away. That was a turning point. I swore to never shed a tear for these animals again. I started writing down my thoughts, cooking and going on evening walks to cope. I\u2019m 18 now, and I\u2019m in therapy. My body has been used and manhandled. But I don\u2019t want to let another guy getaway, with anything, with a single goddamn thing. And to the ones who got away because I was afraid, all I have to say is, FUCK YOU.\u201d \u201cMy biggest achievement: This is not my story.\u201d I couldn't hold my tears after reading this article featured in \u2018Humans of Bombay'. For a second, I thought that being an Indian it is an achievement for me. I am lucky enough not being get raped, isn't it? But what about her? Is she okay? Definitely not.  And what about these[1] - Rape is the fourth most common crime against women in India. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) 2018 annual report, 33,356 rape cases were reported across India in 2018. Out of these, 31,320 were committed by someone known to the victim (93.9% of the cases). 33356 rape cases in a year, it means 116 cases per hour. Can you imagine? If you are reading this, I request you to respect everyone irrespective of their caste, colour and gender. Footnotes[1] Rape in India - Wikipedia",

I had been raised in a very strict, black and white family with mental illness challenges growing up so having a good rule book to follow was not mine for the taking. In addition to being ill equipped to deal with children, I was granted two extraordinary ones to raise - an artist who definitely saw life in colors and kept things mixed up, and my scientist who from the start would challenge all of societies beliefs on what a child her age could do. I have had to relocate, advocate and fight for both of them to have the opportunities they needed to be the most successful in this life - and every sacrifice along the way was nothing but a stepping stone to making me the best person I could be. Now sitting looking back I know every decision is one I would make again, despite the fact that family, friends and others did not agree and many did not make the trip to the end with me. The fantastic humans that matter are now a college art teacher, and a Phd candidate marine biologist, so I think I will be able to sleep at night with my decisions not weighing me down one bit. ",

            "answer_text": "Dreams? I can say, the day I have understood the correct meaning of this five letter word, my life has been transformed into a fairy tale. It all started with one embarrassing experience but a fortunate one. I had terrible stage fright. Whenever I was asked to present something in front of a group or an entire class, it had always been a disastrous experience.  One experience changed my life. I was mocked down by a group of boys in my second year of engineering, when I was called in front and as always, I was shivering and mumbling.  I took that laughter to heart and trained myself in public speaking. Months passed, and I started enjoying myself being on stage. I won several public speaking competetions, one after another. It was third year of my college and I already had three trophies at my name, job offers to train people overcoming stage fright and much more. This was a dream come true. Out of this, came my dream - To become The Greatest motivational speaker. On the top of my bucket list was to organise a motivational event \" Drmz Do Come True \" before completing my engineering.   It was a huge success. This was a dream come true. After innumerable failures and rejections, heartbreakes and crashes, I've recently launched my book The Night I Woke Up -which is a success in just a week!  I literally cried when I touched it for the first time. This is dream come true. I have transformed myself and my life into a fairytale because I always believed that it is possible. All of my dreams are now coming true. I love every single minute of my life.  ",

But how many of us have been granted PERMISSION to question the notion? Most of us seem to just assume that the meaning is OBVIOUS, right? \u201cThis is what YOU did,\u201d or \u201cthis is what you FAILED to do!,\u201d are words and ideas, full of emotion, that we all seem to be accosted with from the very moment words seem meaningful to us, as mere toddlers. But how many of us have asked the question, \u201cdoes anyone ever do anything, as in: EVER?\u201d Have YOU ever asked yourself that question without IMMEDIATELY assuming a position on either the question (as absurd, perhaps?), or on the answer (as, for example, \u201cof course everyone is doing, and has done, SOMETHING!\u201d Suffice it to say that there ARE those who believe that we have no ACTUAL agency. That, in truth, Life, or The Universe, or Nature, or God, or Something Else Entirely, is acting THOUGH us, and we, ourselves, as separate entities, do NOTHING. We are merely a vehicle, or instrument, of some Other \u201cForce Of Nature,\u201d or some such extraneous Power. Be that as it may, I will wrap this up with two statements. My personally most satisfying \u201cachievement,\u201d if you can call it that, is to FORGIVE ALL. I call it Radical Forgiveness, and it means that I forgive all \u201cwrongs,\u201d whether real or imaginary, that have ever happened, whether \u201cdone\u201d by other humans throughout history, or by animals, since the beginning of time, or by the Universe Itself. I won\u2019t elucidate further, unless asked to.I strongly suggest that others ask themselves the very profound and meaningful question, \u201cis there really any such thing as an Achievement?\u201d But I mean to truly spend time on the question. To really postpone jumping to ANY conclusions as to what this might or might not mean. But rather, to sit with it, patiently, to see just what thoughts, feelings, ideas, quotations, inner voices, have to say to you. Just surrender to letting the question just hang there, without resolution. Just meditate and contemplate the question for as long as you can. Some might take seconds, to do this. Others, minutes, hours, days, life times. But I\u2019m insisting that the LONGER one take to truly honor this question, the deeper, wider, higher and most fully will be the satisfaction in Pure Awareness As To The True Nature Of What It Means To Be Alive.",

I managed to survive until today and I still have the mindset to make my life amazing and to live it to the fullest. That, on it\u2019s own, is the biggest achievement in my eyes.  I have a couple dozen medals from sports tournaments in my cupboard, have academic achievement awards I didn\u2019t even apply for, have been published on amazing sites, have millions of views, helped a crazy amount of people and have reached truly mind-boggling achievements with them. None of these these are achievements I am not proud of, and none of them are anything to scoff at either, but these achievements aren\u2019t what matters most. There were so many days I could have just thrown in the towel. There were so many days where it all seemed so much, where it all seemed like it wasn\u2019t worth it, and where it would have been so much easier to just settle for a lesser life. There were days where I wish I could have just despaired, given up, and even a few where I wanted to end it all. But I am still here! I did not give up. I did not surrender. I did not let go. To me, that is the greatest achievement ever. It\u2019s hard to live your life to the fullest\u2026 in fact, it\u2019s hard just living in the first place! Choosing to live your life, day after day, choosing to keep going, to fight your fears, and trying to make the best of your life is not easy and I respect everyone who does this! My greatest achievement is that I am still actively living my life. I am still trying! I am still grinding! I do not just exist. I AM ALIVE! ",

I have lived on my own for just over 15 years, and with the exception of perhaps the first Christmas, I have truly never felt alone. I may have gotten lonely on occasion, but I have never felt alone! That is huge for me. I was desperately lonely and solitary growing up. I thought marriage would fix this and it didn\u2019t, though in my second marriage, I felt a part of a family, with siblings (my brother and sisters-in-law) that I had never known. It didn\u2019t relieve my feeling of being alone. In the months before I started out on my 15 years of self-discovery, I had decided that I was lonely and alone, and if I felt like that in a relationship, I may as well end it. Then if I felt lonely and alone, I only had myself to blame. Those were the smartest words I have ever spoken to myself. I thought I had the world at my feet and it was awesome. I didn\u2019t think life could get any better. Then, almost nine years ago, I adopted my dog! My life is now happy, fulfilling and complete! ",

When I was 25 years old I went to Laos to teach woodworking as a volunteer teacher pre Peace Corps with International voluntary Services Incorporated I spent four years developing a woodshop I'm building a lot of personal Furniture in that wood shop in that four years along with set developing a program I had allow a carpenter for a helper who did all the interpreting and all over verbal teaching and I demonstrated while he told him what I was doing it was an incredible four years that changed my life then when I came back I taught drafting I taught metalworking I taught General shop until 1976 and then that time I was quite creative with a drafting program that I was involved in at the middle school level then I just up and quit then I went into building things for people remodeling while I was still on my on time I did a lot of community theater almost 27 years because I had a great singing voice but a lot but I was a lousy musician so I could never go professional but I had fun in community theater then I did 14 musicals in my musical career have made professional recordings only sacred the Broadway stuff I did just wasn't good enough my piano player wasn't that good on Broadway but she was marvelous on religious music she and I are both graduates of Florida Southern College but we never met there because different years she's five years younger than I am and then I spent 30 years an industry one company only and I was planning engineer for that company and I designed and built a tremendous amount of fixtures over a. Of 30 Years also was responsible for repairing equipment and the last plant that we built I helped set up built a lot of the fixtures and I'm still living in the town where it is located which is Jacksonville Florida for the last eight years I have been retired and one of the biggest accomplishments I've done in that eight years is I started doing the maintenance work for a gentleman who owns a luncheon Cafe and breakfast over on the westside of Jacksonville and he bought a 19-6 house that I completely refurbished the two-story stairwell which is absolutely drop-dead beautiful. The upstairs part of the stairwell was never completed properly so I replaced all of the square baluster is to match the ones coming up the stairs and the necessary yellow heart Pine the ride located to do all the balusters on my own lathe I had 16 of them to make and they look exactly like the ones coming up the stairways it's pretty cool plus all the necessary trim coming up the stairways on the right hand side as you go up the landing had to be replaced with wood I found that was older than the building itself came out of an old school house in Jacksonville that the kids and burn the roof and it collapsed and they threw out all that wood on the street which was hard yellow pine for quarter and so that's what the landing flooring is made out of so it's actually older than the stairwell Pine and it looks absolutely gorgeous then I built in a dining room table that one I got it finished it weighed 259 lb and was made out of three Pig drawers that were purchased at echorelics in Jacksonville out of Kentucky from an Old Farm that was bought out and they cost a $600 but the wood was all nine and footlong for five quarter Oak and there was enough Oak in that those three big drawers to build the tabletop and it's frame underneath but not the legs I had to come up with another source of the Yoke but when it was all finished it would seat 14 people and then I started searching high and low for old chairs to refinish two seat around that table so every cherrell practically be different there's a couple that are matched but it's pretty neat and it goes inside on the dining room side of the house it was built in 1960 those are just some of the things that I've accomplished that I think are pretty damn good and I'm at 82 still going and I'm still building stuff that's new for my house my project this month is 6 bookcases for my new library that I just finished and I don't know whether I mentioned or not I can't remember ",

But the good part was that this realization came to me way before time. Professional courses like mass media, business management studies needs to be practised inorder to understand the nuances of this businesses. During my college period, when my friends used to hang out after lectures. I used to spend my hours working as an unpaid Intern. Did I enjoy it? No. Did I learn from it? Yes, tremendously. I did have my days of frustration wherein I used to sulk about not getting to enjoy life the way my friends were getting to. Nevertheless, when the reality hit us hard in 2013, I realized things weren't looking bad at all for me. In fact, I was among the only 3 students who got placed immediately after my graduation. I remember my classmates struggling to get a job for whole of next year and unwillingly had to settle for unpaid internships for a certain duration. I got an amazing mentor in my first job. Credits to him on making me the professional I'm today. I revived my concepts and put them to use in the next two years with my first company. Then came an offer from the big league - which was the current organization. The Job required me to shift my base since my client HO was in Bangalore. I was really apprehensive about taking it up. The only reason was that I'm really close to mum. For me, Home is wherever she is. But at the same time I didn't wanted to be selfish since she had her Full fledged career in Mumbai. But what finally made me say yes was the offer to service one of the fast growing industry - e-commerce and also the fact that I was keen on taking up a course which was only available in a institute in Bangalore. From there began my IPG Journey.. A month into the Job, I realized I was the only person along with business director working on the account. That very year, we saw this e-commerce company taking over the market at a road runner speed. I remember working on 7 to 8 briefs at a time. Almost all the days used to end by 1\u20132 ish at night. And the next day used to start by 9 ish. If you truly love your job, you start appreciating each minute of it. Complaints were out of picture. Personal relationships did take a toll as well with no contact with most of my friends. The few who cared enough stays close even as if today. But it seems, your body doesn't always agree with your mind. I fell sick. And that moment, stress caught me really bad. It took me days to recover. I had to shift back to mumbai to recover properly. But in this one year with this client, we did manage to execute really good campaigns among which was an innovation that helped us build a connect with tier 2 cities in India by enabling free Wi-Fi zones for the masses and also supporting the cause of digital India. It led me to win my first gold at one of my prestigious media awards in India. After moving back to mumbai, I got the opportunity of servicing an FMCG giant in Mumbai. It's been a year now with them. Two months back, I got my company a silver (the one in the pic) for an innovation which was a marriage between digital technology and Out of time media. The second time definitely gave me a big high. Let's see if I can be lucky the third time? Few days back, I was asked to answer a question - which went like - what should I do to make it big in the advertising industry? I absolutely had no answer for this. Because no industry comes with a set of defined rules. It's only hard work that can take you places. My journey will be nothing like yours. But the only advice that I can give from my experience is we all must be - a WIP (work in progress) till the end of our time. The day we exclaim- we know everything is the day when we stop learning. That should never be the case. ",

            "answer_text": "I survived a bad relationship. More like, its aftermath. And I learnt from it, and still use those lessons today. The year was 2013, and the story has been told before. She and I. Good memories. Cold feet. She disappeared. I faltered.  Those few months were pretty awful, and I remember them all to well. I had made the mistake of pouring in my life into a relationship that didn't last long. The end of it saw me broken and damaged, and I felt like things would never be the same.  I felt dependent on someone to be able to function properly. That, is a very toxic feeling. And with time, and help from a few good friends, I got out of the bad space. The experience was rather destructive for me. But with time, I recovered. I made new rules for my life.  I had two choices -  Remain the victim of the circumstances for an unprecedented period of time. Or Bounce back. And I did just that. That experience, in turn, taught me many things that have helped me shape a better life for myself. Which is why, I call my act of swimming against the tide my greatest achievement. Because drowning was never an option. I learnt - Never put the control of your life in the hands of someone else. Never remain stuck in a space for too long. Never stagnate. You just have to keep swimming. Things change. For better, and for worse, and not in any particular order. So, keep your head up high, and persist.Every thing that happens to you in life is a milestone, a lesson. Learn, and move on to the next one. There are more of those to cover.Your family and your friends will be there for you. Don't worry if your relationships fail. These people still have your back. Value them, and keep them close.Thank you for the A2A, Anonymous. :) ",

            "answer_text": "I did not have an idea that someone can cry for me. My colleague Shahin was crying from the core of her heart. I don\u2019t know how to console someone who is crying. Emran\u2019s eyes were wet, and he was trying heart and soul to hide it. My world stopped for a while. I have been rejected from everywhere in my life. Sometimes it was from friends, society, employers and relatives. You know, it gave me a sense of inferiority for a while. But this was a completely new experience for me. Shahin and Emran sat in front of me and were checking the file. I was trying to ease the situation. I told \u201cEmran, could you please bring me the updated file of the sponsored child list?\u201d He searched the file and told, \u201cDada, Here it is.\u201d It was 5.30 a.m. I almost finished my work. That was my last day in office. I said, \u201cOk, it\u2019s a pleasure and wonderful experience to work with all of you. Other field associates were continuously calling over phone and upset about my resignation. I resigned from my post for grabbing another better opportunity in job sector. Our project was being funded by Italy. Total 9 people were working in this project including me. 7 field staffs had to report and inform all the field activities to me. They had to report to me and my boss\u2014 who is project manager of this project. I had to report to project Manager who is the head of this project. All of the field staffs were undergraduate students studying in colleges and universities. Their family\u2019s financial condition were not up to the mark. That\u2019s why they were doing hard jobs at their early age. I always tell one thing to them, \u201cWhatever happens, don\u2019t leave your studies. Education can change the life of people.\u201d Sometimes our female staffs used to share during conversation, \u201c Shovan bhai, We have to marry within a short period of time. Then, Education does not have any value. If husband does not permit, we will not able to do job.\u201d I replied, \u201cFuture is always uncertain. We don\u2019t have any control over it. But you have control over what you can control. Complete your studies, apply for a better job, become self-dependent , then marry a person who can adjust with your life and respect your opinion.\u201d Whatever the work load in office, I always grant a leave before their exam time. For that reason, my boss warned me several times to give favor to the staffs. I never considered them as a subordinates, rather I viewed them as colleagues. I tried to work as a team. As a result, I got tremendous team effort. I used to inspire them, supervise them not only as a boss, but also as a mentor. There was a ambiguous system in our project office in which all the field staffs had to pay for lunch. I found that weird as the salary of a field associate was very poor, yet their work load was high. So, I withdrew the system of paying for lunch and made it free all the field staffs. I implemented the system despite facing several problems from authority. There was a huge pressure and workload in our office. We had to work day and night. Sometimes I pressurized to them for maintaining deadline because I had lots of pressure from donors, project manager and management to maintain deadline. It's been few months since I resigned from that job. Yet, my colleagues call me, ask for advice, and invite me to attend different occasions. Besides, I helped lots of families in my life who were unable to pay school fees or education materials for their children. As a result I\u2019ve received love, affection and blessings from those families. I don\u2019t know why they love me so much. I am not entirely selfless as they think I am. Sometimes excess love make someone guilty whether he is eligible for it or not. I believe that getting love from the people is the biggest achievement in my life. ",

            "answer_text": "It was September 2010. I had 104\u00b0 fever, platelets were down to 48,000, Doctor asked my parents to admit me as soon as possible. It was a severe case of dengue. I had my interview scheduled at 3 pm in Gurgaon office of S&P Global. I had cleared 4 tough rounds 15 days back. Even standing was difficult for me because of the severe body & back ache also Gurgaon was 35 kilometres away. Parents asked me to drop the interview and go to the hospital as life is much important than career. Not going was the best option but I was in extreme dilemma because I had a secret which my parents did not know! I desperately needed to be independent from my father's business because I belonged to a traditional Jain business family and the love of my life was Punjabi. I knew my parents would never accept her with open hands and would pressurize me to take a step back. It was so important because living without her was not an option, if I could imagine my life she couldn't be missing otherwise no life was a better option. I got out of bed with help of my brother who knew everything and supported me. I bathed and got ready by 1 pm and asked my parents to take me for the interview. They hesitatingly accepted my offer. While we drove to Gurgaon I felt asleep in the back seat of the car. We reached by 2.30 pm. Father and brother took me to the office on the 9th floor. They were not allowed inside so I went alone. The desperate need and love forced me to forget the misery and appear healthy. The only other person selected from my college, one of my friend was already there, we shook hands. She stared at me and asked why my hands were so hot? I said \u201cYou know I am hot\u201d She nodded in irritation & said \u201cyou have fever right!\u201d We both sat on the comfortable sofa and she started preparing for the interview. I couldn\u2019t study so sat silently. It was 3 pm and we had to wait till 6.30 pm for the interview because the managers were busy. These were the toughest three and a half hours of my life. My parents were upset and kept visiting me asking me to go back. But I had the target in mind. Finally I was called inside for the interview. A panel of three managers were sitting there. I had low energy so the best option was not to get too excited and answer everything soberly. It was a 25 minutes interview and my back and head were aching continuously. The fever could not steal the confidence level and after a wait of 15 minutes I was told I have been selected for the final round with the director along with my friend. The partial and unexpected success helped me regain some lost energy. Now started the round with director. I had an idea that he would intentionally try to be rude and check my patience level. (some selected seniors told us) He asked me several tough questions (not from finance just general questions) I tried to answer whatever I could but till then I had no patience and energy left in me. He told me I appeared dull and uninterested! I said I stay calm like this only. At first I thought to tell him that what I was suffering from but then decided not to tell because sympathy can't make you a winner. In the end from what I could see he was a bit confused for me but finally shook hands with me and asked me to leave. When he touched my hands he just stared at me once and looked at my red eyes but didn't say anything. I was not 100% sure but from what I could see in his eyes being a senior Director and an experienced professional he decoded the actual situation. After 10 minutes of waiting I was asked to go back. I don't remember much after that and I was straight away taken to the hospital. I was released 2 days later when my platelet count increased. One day after being back at home I was resting and lying on my bed suddenly I recieved a call from the placement coordinator. Here is the conversation- Ma'am: Hi Anubhav! Me: Hi ma'am! Ma'am: Why are you not coming to college? Me: I have fever ma'am once I get well I will bring a medical certificate! Ma'am: Ok! take care! but why didn't your interview go well? I expected you to perform your best and by the way Juhi has been selected. Me: Ma'am I couldn't help I have severe dengue and couldn't perform well. Ma'am: But you could have told me I would have requested them to shift dates. Me: I thought it would not have been possible so at least I should give my chance to it. Ma'am: Anyway you have also been selected! Me: What? Ma'am: Yes! congratulations and I am proud of you! don\u2019t forget to bring sweets when you come back! Me: What? (again) Ma\u2019am: Yes you are selected! Me: Thank you ma'am! I had tear in my eyes because first of all I didn't expect to be selected and second a lot was on stake. I joined the company a year later, While I was on training I once met the same Director in the pantry, he called me and we had the following conversation- Director: You had high fever that day? Me: You still remember my interview sir! Director: Anyway you performed well! Me: Thank you sir! That's it! ",

It\u2019s a tossup between being invited to NYC (I live in Australia) in 2002 to attend a concert at Carnegie Hall where a couple of my pieces for chorus and orchestra were being performed by Baha\u2019is from around the globe \u2026  Under a microscope you may just be able to see a grey-haired figure with a grey tie (in the colour alphabet, grey is for Graham among other names) standing at the far left at the front of the stage, about to take a composer\u2019s bow. The CD\u2019s no longer available, but in the booklet there\u2019s a close-up of me proving I was actually there. If I didn\u2019t have this CD and the program, I\u2019d be doubting it ever happened. There\u2019s been nowhere to go but down ever since. \u2026 and an opera I composed, The Abandonment, being chosen for a theatrical run of four performances in Sydney in 1991. At one performance, after it was reviewed, there were 13 people in the audience. Not bad, eh? Very auspicious number. Just as well it wasn\u2019t being performed in the Sydney Opera House, though the premiere was booked out which makes me feel a lot better. My natural inclination toward absurdism puts this achievement into its true perspective - it may have been \u2018big\u2019 but it was also of zero significance (aside from the company that mounted it going bust), and I wouldn\u2019t mention it if the question was asking what my \u201cmost successful\u201d achievement is, because this big achievement was an equally big failure! But both were big achievements for a composer nobody\u2019s heard of. None of the works has been performed since, so I don\u2019t get to dine out on them - no royalty cheques come my way - but at least when I call myself a composer I know I am one. (Or was one?) Thanks for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "An elegant mind expresses honesty with regard to its endeavours and accomplishments. It does not view them as a source of pride that sets it apart from others. Conversely, it does not undermine them, but simply states what is. Which is my best achievement? I like this word\u2026best. Doing my best. Living my best life. That makes me smile :) I believe that living my best life involves a series of bests. I have learned to celebrate each one to the best of my ability! As for the word \u201creceived\u201d\u2026 do you mean as a reward for my efforts? My view of achievement is that it is something that I work towards and earn as a result of my efforts. Any accolades I may receive will be a result of my energetic investment, not the cause. Achievement is the result of focus and dedication to a goal. Nobody or nothing is going to bestow this upon me. I believe it is imperative to chart and set the course of my ship, and then follow through with enthusiasm. I have learned that what I receive will be of the same energetic signature as that which I extend. It is the Principle of Reciprocity at work. I offer as examples a couple of my most satisfying achievements to date\u2026 I have been singing since I was a teenager, but it was not until approx. 2012 that I decided to get serious about writing songs. Up until then I had been content to sing other people\u2019s songs and write short stories and poetry. I realized that I truly enjoyed writing songs! As I got more into it, I realized that I had to learn a bit of music theory in order to write good songs, so I began learning to play guitar. I am a novice guitar player but can play enough to create the melodies that I communicate to the seasoned musicians with whom I play. That took dedicated, focused work on my part\u2026and really, really sore fingers for many months\u2026but the results have been two studio EP\u2019s Blue Muse and Cain\u2019s Regret. My songs make me, and others, smile :) Last year I decided to compile the process that I developed in order to heal from the deaths of many family and friends in the past decade - so I could let go of grief and live my best life\u2026it became a book that I called Saving Your Own Life: Learning to Live Like You Are Dying. It was published in June 2016. This book becoming a reality is the result of decades of experience; years of dedicated study, research and contemplation; many months of hard work; and a significant investment of funds for which I also worked. Where my music or my writing takes me does not concern me. I simply keep putting the good vibes out there and going with the flow\u2026being open to the good stuff\u2026 That makes me smile too :) I am happy, because, having set up the conditions, I am receiving my best life in every moment of it\u2026and that, my friend, will always be my best Achievement. An elegant mind creates goals and objectives and quietly works towards achieving them. Until then it is content with what is. ",

            "answer_text": "I caught a thief. This is no academic achievement. It's an incident which happened with me while I was in Mumbai, India for my studies for 6 years. I have penned down the incidence and it gives me a sense of achievement. It was the day(31 may 2014, time 7 am, Sunday) I was going to nasik(my home town) by Pushpak express(8.20 am from CST)after a long period of time. With one bag and a purse, I boarded the train on harbor line and sat in ladies coach to head to my destination, i.e. CST. There were only 5 more women excluding me in that coach(for those of you who might not know, harbour line is not much crowded as compared to other lines and it was Sunday, so less crowd) The train passed a few stations. It was now standing at Mahim station(platform 5). I was sitting on the 3rd seat(not near window or door) doing some task on my mobile phone. After about 20 seconds, there came a hand which grabbed my phone with two fingers. I was shocked ! I thought some familiar person might have grabbed it. But when I turned to find out who it was, that man snatched the phone out off my hand and ran down the door onto the platform. I was still in a shock for 2secs when my conscious told me -I wanted the phone !! Without wasting a second, I jumped off the train which, by this time had come to motion..In a rush, i jumped off the wrong direction( scientifically, you should get down in a direction in which the train is heading). While I should have jumped in the direction in which train was moving, I did opposite and there! I felt flat on my back. \u201cOuchhhh !\u201d Was the word that echoed on that platform. I looked around shockingly to see not a single person standing on the platform ! It was harbor line time 7.20 - 7.25am. That was the time I realised I have to run and catch him. I gathered up all my strength and ran behind him. I wanted to catch him ! Seeing me running behind him, the cheat started running on tracks and towards the western line. For few of those who don\u2019t know, there is a reiling between the harbour and the western line on Mahim station. As accustomed and used to stealing and running, the smart ass started running between the gaps of the reiling towards western line platform. I was still on harbor line. Helplessly, as I ran on the platform, I started shouting at the top of my voice for help. I shouted \" pakdo pakdo chor !! Phone leke Bhaaga \" !! (Thief, thief please catch him, he stole my phone!) Fortunately a few men standing on platform 1 heard my shouts and screams..they started running towards the bridge from platform 1. Realising that I couldn't run on the tracks, I also started running towards bridge from harbor platform. The thief by now, had reached the 3rd platform and was running now towards the bridge(unaware that I was also heading towards the bridge). Within a few seconds, he was trapped between me and the few men who ran to help me. Those men caught hold of him now! (*A sigh of relief*) I grabbed him by his collar and asked for my phone. He, very unwillingly handed over the same to me. Now was my turn. I started beating him up and down every part of his body using my hand and legs as well. My hands bleeding. My back hurting. My blood running down my shirt. But I had to do this. Then it striked me that my luggage is gone with the train ! My money, my belongings !! Nonetheless, I was determined to hand him over to the police. So I took him on the nearest platform (1st platform). Unfortunately, I couldn't locate a police officer/office. So then, I took him to the TC office which was on 1st platform. I narrated my story and asked them to call for police. I also ordered them to call up next station and tell them to get my luggage off the train and keep it safe. They did so. Surprisingly, the feedback from the next station was that the ladies from my train had got off on the next station and were waiting for me to come by the next train! It took around 10 minutes for the police to finally show up and to tell me \" ye harbor ka case hai. Waha k police hi help Karenge\u201d(this was a harbour line case and western line police couldn't help). So now, I again dragged him up with the help of 2 men who had helped me to catch him, climbed the bridge and took him to the harbor police near platform 6. Ok so now, there was a constant thought hammering my mind that I have to catch my train for Nasik and I have to reach CST anyhow before the time slips off. My next train was 7.47 am from mahim. It was 7.42 am now. The police told me to complete some formalities and to give them my phone. I said \u201cI don't have time to do all the formalities.\u201d To which they told me,\u201dthere's nothing more we can do to help you\u201d. So I decided, let me just beat him up more. I did so and when I heard the sound of next train coming up, I ran again to board it and I sat in the 1st ladies coach. On next station, with God's grace what I see is- the ladies who were sitting in my coach when I jumped off from the train were standing with my luggage !! (It was surprising because we all were strangers to each other!!) Mumbai.. unbelievable! So helpful people. I took the bags from them(still standing at the door of the same train). At 8.18 am, my train reached CST station. My train for Nasik was at 8.20am. I had to run again to catch it !! For few seconds I just ran madly from 1 platform to another. And there It was ! On platform number 16- My train standing. I ran till my coach and only when I finally was on my reserved seat, I realised that my shirt was all wet by blood(backside) and my hands were still bleeding ! In the same condition I went till nasik and then my dad came to pick me up and I was straight taken to the casualty unit of my hospital(my dad is a doctor)!! Today, thinking of this incidence still gives me goosebumps. God, thanks for this experience !! It really gave me a sense of achievement. I could do it! ",

            "answer_text": "Let's talk about my last or latest greatest achievement(according to me ;-)) that is leaving all the social sites for more than about 6 months. Getting into details of it: I have uninstalled WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook last December. It's been more than seven months now. I have not installed any of these but yes after finishing my important exams I have logged in Instagram in May in my siblings\u2019 mobile because I promised myself I will not install any of these in my phone until I achieve all my desired goals of 2019. After May I used insta few times like once in a month in their phone only. It's a great achievement for me because I have never thought of it that I will feel so good after this simple step. It taught me how much crucial time we waste on seeing others\u2019 lives day-to-day activities instead of working on ours. And I am still not saying it's a completely bad thing but still do it once you will feel how you are so focused on your journey, your goals, your aims, your people who care for you enough to keep calling you to keep that valuable friendship alive. You will become more productive because you are no more in auto- mode, you will start filling your life with creative and meaningful things because you will get involve so much in understanding yourself, your hobbies, your strengths, your weaknesses, your thinking patterns. There will be no involvement of any outside attractions. There will be no comparison, no inferiority and no \u201clena-dena\u201d to many unknown people. I feel so grateful everyday that I have taken this step it helped me in finding newer version of myself and new hobbies like reading books and has also taken me close to my goals. Most probably, I will come back if there is any requirement or may be I use them by keeping limited fixed time but I would love to not have these apps in my phone. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Obtaining my M D was undoubtedly my greatest achievement in life. It was fraught with obstacles. My father refused to support my desire to become a physician, as he wanted me to become a nurse-midwife. Therefore I had to act as a companion to my unmarried aunt to ensure that I had a roof over my head and work for eight years as a long-distance operator in the Atlanta telephone office in order to save enough money for college. I was 26 when I started studying for my B S in Chemistry and Physics and the other students called me grandma. This did not stop me from having a good time but I kept my head down, as I had set my heart on studying medicine at Johns Hopkins University, to me the best medical school in the States, and I knew I would need the best grades to be accepted. I married during my junior year at the somewhat advanced age of 28 - at least it was for those days. But this did not stop me from graduating Magna cum Laude in 1980. So I got my place at Johns Hopkins but almost immediately messed things up by becoming pregnant in the second semester. I was urged to terminate the pregnancy or withdraw. I did neither. I discussed the situation with my husband and he agreed to start shift work so that he could look after the baby when I was at lectures. We shared all the chores and baby care 50/50. Without his help, I would never have gotten my M D. But despite the difficulties I encountered on my way, I finally obtained my degree in 1984 at the age of 34. Dr Julia ",

Imagine for a second you are looking into a mirror right now would your shoulders are pushed back, your chest pushed out, your head held high, you are taking deep breaths, you stretch up and when you exhale you say yes very very loud, you have your eyes wide open and you have a smile across your face a big one not that smirk a really big smile the one that makes your mouth spread wide open and would make people stare at you because they would think what is wrong with you and you know your smile is showing them all just how alive you are and just how much you enjoy life right now, wait where is that smile I said smile, not smirk, there it is, yeah go ahead put your head up I see it I feel it there we go that's it SMILE. If you read this far you have no other choice right now you are smiling and if you are not then you know you have to know because life is just great and your smile is your way of showing life that you are it's master.  (If you are smiling and you feel a bit better now then you just did a second or two ago then I have just had the biggest success in life, here's to you and your success!) Yes I am smiling and so are you, enjoy life! ",

I too think that I won't be able to mention one single. Some of the achievements are - I have achieved faith of many unknown people. They met me and don't know why but they blindly believed me. Most of them are still friendly to me and even call me and treat me with respect. (I don't know if such a faith is really there or not, but I get to feel this). This might be because only I was there with them to help them in need.I have learned one thing in my so called life that is \u2018to admit my fault\u2019. This is something what many people take their whole life to learn. So I must count it as my achievement.Many times when I pass by any place I feel that women of the society deserves more freedom and I have influenced some(if not many) of the people to think upon this. This is also perhaps a achievement for me.If someone will say about materialistic achievement then I can say that I have managed to save a very small amount of money and some of the other useless type things. I also did achieve some awards during my academics and some for the sports.Moreover, an important one. One day I wrote an answer on Quora and it was viewed by some of the users and one of them(a girl) commented on it. After seeing the comment I felt nice (it was nothing more than a user can say). Let me show it to you - Thank You ",

Before I began to be more public with my accomplishments, I was treated like everyone else. I had friends. I made the mistake of announcing my Stanford acceptance on social media and when I went back to school, everyone hated me. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not being bullied or teased. In fact, no one really talks about me, to my knowledge. It\u2019s humiliating because I\u2019m the first person to ever get into a school like that at this high school but I get treated like I\u2019m less. I\u2019ve always considered myself to be a very social person and I hate being alone but alas, this is my life now for the next few months before I leave for college. This may not be much but I\u2019m very proud of myself to still gather enough courage to go to school despite feeling so alone and isolated everyday. ",

My wife and I had, essentially, the same job at the same pay so I decided that we were not moving and I became a stay-at-home dad. Our son was never in day care and always came home to a parent. Even though I was tough on his friends, making sure that when the entered the house their shoelaces were tied and their pants were pulled up to their waists, they liked to hang out at our house. Shortly after high school our son joined the Colorado Army National Guard and enrolled at CSU as an engineering student. The Army paid for his degree, paid him monthly, and promoted him to Sergeant before his year-long deployment to the Middle East. After his deployment, he re-enlisted to go to Warrant Officer Candidate School. He graduated 5th in a class of 150 from WOCS and just graduated from CSU with two engineering degrees, Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Science. His three friends turned out well, too. One\u2019s a Los Angeles County firefighter, one\u2019s a Chef, and one is a High School History teacher. ",

            "answer_text": "I volunteered in an NGO in Mumbai in December 2016 for one month as a teacher. The students there had a pathetic life, with some of the kids\u2019 fathers being drunkards and their houses being run by mothers. Some kids had parents who were divorced/widowed and couldn\u2019t manage 2 meals in a day. Most of the parents were uneducated or had taken basic education in vernacular languages. In the last 10 days of my volunteering period, I was given the responsibility of teaching basic English(It was an English medium school) and by basic English I mean basic words like- The, He, She, Cat, Bat, Rat,etc to around 6\u20137 students from 4th and 5th grade in all. Now these words are known even to 1st graders, but those kids were so weak academically that they couldn\u2019t manage to read these words properly. Now the challenge was those kids were hyper-active, and one slight distraction from anywhere and they would start dancing and laughing. I couldn\u2019t scold them and I had to threaten that I would complain to their teachers. So for some time they would sit quietly and then again after sometime the same thing repeated. To teach them, I followed the method of saying the word and its spelling thrice, then asking each of them one by one in circle to repeat the same. After everyone had done that, I would ask them to write those words thrice in their notebooks; and at the end of the day, I would take a dictation of the words. I got and idea and as a punishment, I told the naughty boy(s) that they don\u2019t need to repeat the word so I would skip their turn. So they used to make that innocent face of theirs and would feel guilty. Then in the end I made them repeat the words. It was going well; slowly and steadily they were learning new words, and were able to recall most of the words even after 3\u20134 days. After around 6 days, I made them read a paragraph from their English textbooks. As they read, their English teacher stood nearby and there was a wide smile of happiness and pride because most of them were able to read the sentences perfectly, though slowly. She was so happy! That day I realised- Having able to contribute something in the learning process of those under-privileged kids is my biggest achievement till date. ",

            "answer_text": "Hands down, finishing my first book. I never set out to be an author, but then I never aspired to be sued for $10,000,000 and defamed by the tabloids either! I have had a tendency throughout life to start multiple projects at once. I have countless unfinished and unreleased songs, music videos and random projects as a result. I believe I would be significantly more successful in life if I finished things before moving on to the next. Finishing a book was huge. First, I had to write four mediocre drafts before writing a good one. I went through crippling self doubt while publishing houses rejected me for two years. Imagine going through a traumatic event that was highly publicized only to find out no one wants your story. Eventually, my book found a home. Once I decided I would finish the book come hell or high water, the book got sold. Since mid December, I have been working on this book every single day in some capacity. I have missed tons of social events. I didn't really celebrate the holidays and I took a break from music. The last one is hurting my soul a bit. I wrote at the same bar stool from 2PM to 2AM seven days a week with a couple days off here and there. I realized every new project has a \"honey moon\" phase, which is why it can feel so hard to finish things once the initial high wears off. No media outlet, blog, Quora answer or interview can ever encompass the totality of what I experienced in 2014. The only thing that can do that is an entire book, in my own words. I'm hoping I can take this experience and apply this concept of finishing things to everything I do. ",

But I think that my biggest success was the one that came \u2026 almost in spite of itself\u2026and despite my not even knowing what I was doing. I had retired after selling my printing company and was lucky to receive any payment at all for it as sales had been trending downward for over a decade\u2026 mainly because of the advent of the internet and the personal computer. We retired to Costa Rica and it was to be our \u201clast big adventure\u201d. But I became bored \u2026 even in the midst of one of the most beautiful countries in the world. So i started another business\u2026 with no experience, no startup funds, no connections and no technical background whatsoever. But I had nothing to lose! And I simply put one foot in front of the other and did what I thought was right. And within 18 months we had made more revenue than in the previous decade\u2026 we were featured in Newsweek Magazine, Investors\u2019 Business Daily, Bankrate\u2026 and I was arguably one of the leading realtors and developers in the entire country of Costa Rica. I didnt think twice about it. Because it just happened. It was kind of like winning the lottery because it was all almost like it was preordained. And it took me ten years before I really did an autopsy on my business and what really happened. Then I got excited. Because, if you have ever heard the phrase \u201cfake it \u201ctill you make it\u201d\u2026 that was written for me. And even though we had phenomenal success and it really was\u2026 it seemed natural\u2026 and I also have to remember that we enjoyed the journey, every minute of it and I was never afraid of losing or failing. I cannot describe the feelings that were there during our time in Costa Rica except that they were exhilarating and almost empowering because I would simply do what I felt was right\u2026 and if something didnt work out\u2026 well, we didnt look back and went full steam ahead. It was my biggest success because at the time it didnt seem like it. We were even what I called \u201csemi famous\u201d and regarded as authorities in our marketplace. It was success because I was not afraid of failing and was not afraid to try. No, it does not always work out this way\u2026 but you will never know unless you try. Thanks for reading\u2026 my story is my reinvention. ",

            "answer_text": "When I first started working, I had absolutely no knowledge about programming or IT for that matter. I entered the field as a complete newbie. It was an entire shift of career in my life. Initially I used to find everything so difficult. I used to look at people typing incessantly on their systems and getting things done while I couldn't understand a word during my training period. I am a very slow learner. Things don't get into my head as easily as others. I need the thing to be told a lot of times to be able to understand it fully. And this was a completely new thing. I became depressed for a long time and had given up in my head. But quitting was not an option. But I knew I wouldn't be able to survive for too long. Until graduation I had never known what failure felt like, at least in academics. I had always been amongst the top students. But here I was the worst in the bottom most ones. It took me quite a while to understand that I have to be patient with myself. I cannot ridicule myself for not being good enough at something others had been doing for ages. And that I don't even have to compare myself with others. I have my own set of different analytical abilities which set me aside from mainstream. Reaching to this point of understanding myself required lots of sleepless nights crying, feeling inefficient, cursing myself, sad and what not. And here I am, been working for almost 2.5 years. I can proudly say that I have been surviving well. I wouldn't say I worked very hard and now have become a great programmer. I haven't. But I can say I have learnt and become competent enough to get my work done efficiently. At least today I am not what I was when I started working. I have built my set of abilities and credibility. I am not amongst the best programmers or analysts but I certainly have improved a lot. Learning to survive holds a lot of significance for me as it was a battle I have fought all alone. Sure, there were people I shared my problems with, but I could only get an assurance from them that I will be just fine. It was me alone who fought my own insecurities, incompetency, comparative mentality and negative mindset. And today, I can proudly say that I am doing just fine! ",

            "answer_text": "I had cleared IITJEE 2013 with an average kind of rank (3186) but I don\u2019t consider that my biggest achievement. I had my biggest achievement and my biggest failure at the same time, 2 days back. On 8th January 2018, CAT 2017 results were declared. Here is how my biggest achievement and biggest failure look, aligned side by side.  I have scored 101.09/102 marks in Quant. I got 33/34 questions right. I believe my rank in Quant should be in Top 10 out of 2,31,000 students who appeared for the exam. This is my biggest achievement. I have scored 162.03/300 marks overall and an overall percentile of 98.19 in the same exam. I have failed to get calls from India\u2019s top coveted B-Schools (IIM A, B, C, L). For me, this is my biggest failure. Ironically, I had given the least amount of time to quants and have scored maximum in it. I had devoted all the time to Verbal and DILR. I read newspapers for 1.5 - 2 hours every day, solved countless sectional tests of DILR and VARC but couldn\u2019t perform well on the D-Day in these 2 sections. I had prepared for CAT 2017 religiously for exactly 4 months (August-November). It is usually said that an aspirant can prepare well for CAT in 3 - 4 months. In my opinion, the time required for you to prepare for any entrance examination depends (most importantly) on the knowledge with which you start \u2013 your origin on your preparation graph. Being an engineer, I guess, my origin for quant was way ahead (as much as that I didn\u2019t even have to practice apart from mocks) in comparison to DILR and Verbal that I couldn\u2019t get better even after rigorously dwelling myself in only these 2 sections for 4 months. I think my knowledge (at the start) was far behind those who are avid readers (who manage to ace the Verbal Section with 3-4 months of preparation). I should have started early. This is not the only reason though, I couldn\u2019t sleep well on the exam day and I blanked out. But I am not going to let all my hard work and preparation go into waste. I am preparing for CAT 2018 now and I will prepare for 1 full year. Hopefully this time, I wouldn\u2019t end up blaming myself. ",

However, soon I realized that there is no fixed formulae of success and everyone succeed in their own way. You can find bosses who perform well by putting their subordinates under tremendous pressure and you can also find bosses, who succeed without even raising their voice. We admire Mahatma Gandhi who practiced nonviolence and we also admire Bhagat Singh who was a revolutionary. There is a place for everyone in this world. When we try to become someone, we are under constant state of tension. Please look the picture of two different springs in the figure below.  These springs are by design of different lengths. If you try to make the first spring to the size of later or vice-versa, both springs would be under the constant tension as they would be craving to come back to their natural size all the time. We are like these springs. We are comfortable being ourselves.If we live the life of any other person, we can\u2019t be comfortable. I have tried to discover myself and then redefine success and joy for me. If I love reading and writing, I do it notwithstanding what other people think about it. I don\u2019t force myself to imitate anyone or please anyone to win any favours from them. I don\u2019t bother if others consider me successful or happy as far as I am able to be myself and do the things that I like to do. ",

The times when I have a good feeling are when I realize that I am raising 6 beautiful and amazing children who will (God willing) go on to do amazing and beautiful things in the world. The times when I have a bad feeling are when I realize that humans cannot achieve anything in the world that lasts for very long and so trying to come up with something that qualifies as an achievement is really, really hard. However, ultimately the greatest thing I have achieved is the realization that I know nothing and am completely at the mercy of forces that are greater than I am. Why is this a great achievement? It is a great achievement because it results in absolute transparency with life happening all around me. I am no longer under the sway of my own delusion and can open my mind and heart to greater viewpoints than my own. Such openness has provided me with vastly more connected knowledge than I possess prior to this achievement. I have even come to understand how evolution, creation, and intervention work together to produce the reality we have right now. All in, humility has given me more than I have put into it and it certainly is not a weakness. ",

I would just scroll each and every feed. Took screenshots so that I could follow the same Started uploading a good number of insta status so that I could get reactions on my stories. There was a change in my behavior (I felt this) I would get irritated every now and then reason was simply my addiction to social media ( I tried implementing things which weren't of my type and this approach of mine landed me into irritation). No sooner I realised that somewhere I am hurting myself And that was it Now I have limited my use of social media (uninstalled Facebook and turned off notifications for Instagram ,and not to use social media until and unless it's necessary) It was just a mere achievement but yaa i am living at peace now \ud83d\ude42..  Atleast i realised social media is nothing but a waste of time and it will make people depressed some day.

            "answer_text": "My greatest achievement in life was to actually getting serious about my health, showing immense interest, dedication to do it. I have never been that serious about my studies, carreer, dating, life etc. and so on. 2 great achievements: Stop Smoking.Lose 10 Kgs. weight.It is nothing new but the amount of time, dedication, control, focus these tasks need; they actually make you challenge yourself. 1st Challenge: Stop Smoking: I was not into smoking but still it is a habit you just can\u2019t escape from. I got into smoking and smoked for 1 year more or less. After sometime I was smoking around 5+ cigarettes in a day, after every 10\u201320 mins I felt like I need some \u201cfresh air\u201d. I started to feel drowsy, smelt like ash and started hated that feeling. So near about 8 months, I started the fight to stop smoking: How did I do that? I quora\u2019d all the stuff to help me stop smoking, side effects and good effects after smoking. There were many straight good answers on quora. I really thank to all quorans who answered too top smoking. I first started to make my mind stronger about why I should quit it. Then, I learned started saying NO whenever someone offered to me. I reduced my interaction with smokers. I reduced my daily intake. And started to cut it more and more. One day it\u2019s just started as any other other day, I didn\u2019t take a puff that day and after that it is more than 3 years. My previous short answer: What is it like to quit smoking? Fun Fact: You won\u2019t believe guys, there is a phase, where you actually smoke in your dreams. After the dream, when I woke up in the morning and I smell like ash. Sounds crazy I know. You can google it. Dreams of Smoking Cigarettes While Quitting Smoking. If you find yourself dreaming about smoking cigarettes in the middle of a quit smoking campaign, don\u2019t be alarmed. As this study suggests; it\u2019s an entirely normal phenomenon and one to be expected during both chemical withdrawal and medium to long term recovery. 2nd: Losing Weight: Backstory: I was in standard 11th, 75 kgs and I was 5\u20328\u2033, i checked my weight thought I am over weight, checked BMI it said 75 is ok as per my height. I promised to myself then that I will join the gym when i surpass 80 kgs. Year is 2016, indulged in my 2nd bad habit, Drinking; I weigh myself, 82 Kgs. So, I have to abide the promise I made to myself but it started due to another reason Here. I was kind of heartbroken at that time, within 6 months I had 2 heart breaking scenarios. So, I was actually searching on quora how to distract myself from the crap. And it was mentioned on quora to channel this energy into some positive activity and at multiple places I found that gym can be one of your place to chanel all that energy. So, I actually found a reason to join the gym connected it to my promise and channeled all the energy. Of course the path was not that easy, after work, reaching home and getting up from the bed. All parts of your body tells you not to go to the gym, you have to set aside all that and just dedicate yourself into the thing. How did I do that? First, mentally preparing myself why I have to do it which i explained above. Setting a target for my self. My target was to lose 10 kgs. It took me around 6 months to come into that range.  As you can see, the gym completely changed my life and I am still going for it. I am maintaining my weight as much as I can. While the above was ongoing, i had a friend with whom I discussed all the stuff and we helped each other in our rough patches. He forward me this video and it was so relatable.  You will surely love the video. All and all, sorry guys for writing too much. I hope, there are some more people inspired. ",

            "answer_text": "I know that I probably should say my kids\u2026but making the kids was pretty easy (for me, anyhow), and even sort of fun. And raising them was challenging - but I firmly believe that parents have only a partial impact on how kids grow up; a lot is due to genetics. So I can\u2019t really claim my kids as my greatest achievement. There are three things I am proud of and that I can take almost sole credit for - my doctorate and my professional certification. I\u2019m proud of my Naval service as well - but a lot of people have spent time in the Navy. The doctorate was a lot of work - and I was also working full-time during my undergraduate, MS, and PhD work. So not only did I have to meet all the program requirements, take the classes, and do my dissertation research - but I had to do it all while I was working, married, and taking care of kids. So it was a little more challenging for me than for many of the other students. And I was able to publish 5 papers from my doctoral dissertation and another paper or two from my MS thesis. So I was proud of that as well. But I have to say that my professional certification process was even more difficult - the year I took the exam, fewer than 20% of those taking the exam passed it. Not only that, but I don\u2019t have a degree in Health Physics (the science of radiation safety). So I had to do a LOT of self-study in order to be able to take and pass the exam. The other thing is that there are only about 1300 certified health physicists in the world - the success rate is lower than in doctoral programs. So one of those\u2026but I\u2019d hate to have to choose. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably, the biggest achievement I\u2019ve made was starting my own band from scratch and utter confusion.  Hello, we\u2019re Skarizon, and this is what we do! This wasn\u2019t the first time I tried starting a band. Last year, I was part of a music club. My musical contribution came in the form of tabla solos, something that added to the cultural and musical diversity, and the overall sound of the club. There were two other members who also played Indian musical instruments - our club founder played the harmonium, and another member played the veena. For our school\u2019s annual Art Stroll festival, the three of us played an Indian song with me doing a short solo at the end. Carried away by the success of that show, at the start of 10th grade, I tried starting an Indian classical music band and invited those two members. However, the club fell apart after the first meeting because, to them, it seemed like an extension of the other music club. The two people I asked to join also felt they didn\u2019t have the time to join (note: I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t have any hard feelings towards them, even though I was rather disappointed). During this same time, in jazz band, we started playing ska music. My jazz band teacher, Dr. Liddell joked about someone making a ska band and playing in all sorts of ska clubs. Even though he was joking, the idea still clicked in my head. I always wanted to start my own band, and ska music had a very happy, upbeat feel to it that would make it appealing to anyone. I started getting people interested in my band. At first, I was rather halfhearted with my efforts to get people interested; I didn\u2019t feel too confident about the chances of getting our band successful. However, after 2019 came around, I firmly resolved to make this band not another failed idea of mine. I started asking more people more frequently. Before I knew it, I got two interested members. The first to join was our bassist Daniel, then our guitarist Rohan. I then spread the word of my band around school, and I quickly got more people. Our bari sax player Chayla was the next to join, followed by keyboardist Mark. I kept Dr. Liddell appraised of the details, and one day, after jazz band had ended, while talking to him, I was approached by our clarinet player Annabelle, who wanted to join as the pianist. Even though the piano spot was already taken by Mark, she still joined, and her skills at clarinet became quite useful for the horn section. Julia, our flute player, was \u201cforced\u201d into joining the band. Our last member of the band was Ron, the alto sax player. At first, he said he didn\u2019t have time to commit to the band, but after a few months, I asked him again, and he readily joined. Now that I had enough people, I had to work on getting enough songs. Dr. Liddell sent me a long list of ska songs. In turn, I made my own list of songs that could sound good with the band (some of them were traditional ska, others were 90\u2019s ska punk, and the rest were songs that could sound good in ska). Daniel started finding non-ska songs, including Rick Astley\u2019s classic \u201cNever Gonna Give You Up\u201d and the popular rock song \u201cSeven Nation Army\u201d, and started arranging them in traditional ska. Only two months before the Art Stroll, we got our setlist ready. For another one of our songs, I chose the happiest ska song I\u2019ve ever heard, \u201cLatin Goes Ska\u201d by the Skatalites. 5 of the people in my band, including myself, were also part of the high school jazz band, and we already played this song. Consequently, it was easy for us to teach the other two members that song. We played Daniel\u2019s amazing arrangement of \u201cSeven Nation Army\u201d. Because we were given only 20 minutes for our show, we needed a third song. This one was \u201cSpread Satin\u201d by Roland Alphonso. Dr. Liddell conveniently had arrangements of this song, and he happily gave it to us. This song was the hardest one to master, but we managed to figure everything out during our last practice and were ready to play. Our show was amazing, far better than anything I ever expected. Sure, we performed in an outdoor area and had to deal with sheet music flying all over the place (not to mention somewhat poor sound quality), but the crowd was very appreciative and supportive. We were the first solely student-run band, and we played a very unique form of music that not many people had heard of. This is the video of our performance during the Art Stroll. It was our debut show, and we made a great first impression.  I\u2019ve run 3 half marathons, reached black belt in Tae Kwon Do, had a successful first year in an FRC robotics team, made it to an awesome high school (I got into their IB program!), but none of those compare to the amazing feeling I got when my band Skarizon made it this far.

            "answer_text": "Quitting smoking? The birth of my daughter? Learning to swim a little at age 35? Graduating high school, then college, then graduate school, in that order? Living this long considering all the lucky times incidents that things could have turned out differently. I\u2019ve shared a lot of stories on QUORA about near misses and times in my life I felt like I had to have had Guardian Angels watching over me. I actually still have quite a few more to share but for now I will mention this one. For instance, one time around 25 years ago while we were in Costa Rica on vacation we went with an local tour bus to see Arenal volcano up close. I knew nothing about how dangerous volcanos could be unless these were out and out erupting. We trusted outlet our guide locals. They seemed to know what they were doing. They grew up in the area and lived nearby afterall. We got closer to the volcano when it began to erupt ash. They stopped the bus and we all got out to see the ash. Before long the bus was covered in ash. I think it started raining? Like the volcano caused its own weather change? Suddenly it began spewing more than just ash, though that in itself was bad enough and the first warning to high tail it out of there. My husband remembers the bus driver and tour guide hurriedly getting everyone back on the bus and driving gas as can be out of there. I look back on this now and say, \u201cGeez, what the heck were we all thinking\u201d ?! We had no business not making sure before we even went that we were safe to go where we went and then at the first sign of ash we should have left immediately and not when things got that dangerous!\u201d Until recently my husband had bags of ash from Arenal he kept as a souvenir. What I remember was that when we got back to La Fortuna we dragged our bed mattress out into the balcony on the second or third floor of the hotel where we could hang out and see Arenal in the distance with red lava flowing out. I thought that was so cool I did not want to miss a moment of it. I am not sorry I experienced this but that bus covered with ash is kind of a blur. I must\u2019ve been frightened? Or I was clueless. Now I realize how lucky we were that something much worse hadn\u2019t happened. I think we\u2019d been to the Monteverdi Cloud Forest right before this and we were on a high from having seen a Quetzal bird and toucans and a sloth. Next we were headed to horse back ride and check out hot springs in Guanacaste. We were newly married only a year and this was more exotic and adventurous than I\u2019d ever experienced (except for the month long Malaysia, Borneo, Singapore trip the year before). I trusted my husband to know what he was doing. I always thought he was smarter than I and more experienced at travel definitely. He\u2019d backpack traveled throughout India, Nepal, Thailand and Indonesia and across the USA to Canada and along the west coast in a camper van before we ever met. I didn\u2019t worry too much. I do usually go with gut instincts though. I don\u2019t remember the volcano erupting ash incident in detail like my husband does. He says now that we were damn lucky. Departing from that volcano area in the tour bus covered in ash was a close call. It took me years to realize this so I never attributed surviving this to my usual Guardian Angels watching over or intervening. I happened to be reading about Costa Rica and volcanoes decades later. I was looking up Arenal and various popular spots to visit. That\u2019s when I realized how risky that was and how worse things could have turned out. My husband wanted to go back and take our daughter there. I thought there were other \u201csafer\u201d places to visit instead.

            "answer_text": "Raising six children who are trustworthy, kind, and lovable. None of my children have ever been arrested or become addicted to drugs or committed any significant crimes (or even insignificant ones). My eldest son spent 4 years in the US Air Force in Intelligence, signing up the day after 9/11. My middle and youngest sons are currently in the US Marine Corps Reserves, one as a stay-at-home dad of two and the other starting a career in financial services. My eldest daughter has been happily married to her high school sweetheart for almost seven years now and recently returned to college. My middle daughter is a sophomore in college and my youngest daughter is still at home as a freshman in high school. My girls are all musical - much more so than me: two play cello, two play piano, one guitar, one flute, one violin, one viola, one saxophone, and one has a particularly amazing singing voice, although they all carry notes pretty well - no bucket needed. Even my boys got in the act - one played trombone in his high school marching band and two played clarinet. All of my children tested as gifted or profoundly gifted in school (personally, I credit reading to them every night for many years - they all have a love of books that matches my own). But the achievement that I\u2019m most proud of is that all six are trustworthy, kind, and lovable. It\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about them. ",

To show my achievement, I will show you my 10-year challenge of what I had and what I have now. For this, I will be sharing some background details. so that you can just compare between me (10 years ago) and me (today). 10 years ago. Me:  My house(left one):  MY study table:  Road to my home:  My village:  Note: I used to take animals for feeding rather than going to school. One day, my stomach started paining badly. I took local treatment (12 km from my home), but the doctor (after trying several medicines) asked us to go to the city (case of emergency). My parents took me to the city for treatment (got appendicitis). After operation and recovery, I came back to the village. But what I saw during one week's stay in that city, was not going from my mind. I used to become happy whenever I remembered about the facilities they had. Curiously, I asked my father. How can I go there forever? He smiled at me and said: not forever, but if you score good marks in 10th, I can send you to study further (My happiness had no limit). Now, I had an aim that I have to go to that city and for this, I have to study very hard to get first division (criteria decided by father). But I had no one to guide. No one tells me what to do. I tried and tried and tried. And did whatever I could. Finally, after the 10th result, I got 70% (on state board). I was the topper in my school (at most went school 10 times a year). The principal came along with one teacher to congratulate me and then news spread that someone\u2019s son has done very well and the headmaster came to congratulate (first time in my village). And from that time to now. Time has changed and it has changed me too. This is me now (in IIT Kharagpur).  B. Tech. (BIT Sindri- one of the famous government engineering college of all time in Jharkhand)(2013\u20132017). GATE- AIR-60\u203217. M. Tech.- IIT Kharagpur (2017\u20132019). Ph. D.- IIT Bombay (2019- till now) and will continue\u2026\u2026 Part-time work- Now, I teach children of my village during vacations and till now I have taught four engineers (including me) in my village compared to none in the nearest 5 villages (10 years ago). It also helped one to achieve 3rd Rank in the state (district topper) in the 10th class. Now it depends on you whether you consider it as an achievement or not, but I do. Thank You. Edit 1: Thanks for the support. Keep supporting me, and keep motivating me. Edit 2: 1K+ followers now. All credit goes to this journey. This answer has changed my follower list from 4 to 1000 within a month. Follow me more for career-related doubts/ motivational stories. ",

I had a very traumatic childhood, gave a child up for adoption, 2 failed marriages, losing my children\u2019s love and respect, a toxic family, battling depression, bipolar and countless suicide attempts since my teen years. One day, I woke up and completely realized that the drug life was no longer fun for me. I had attempted to get clean a few times, one period was almost two years. I picked up my life, moved 1000 miles away and asked God to help me. My relationships with most of my family are severed, but at least now I can see that the root of all issues wasn\u2019t my drug addiction and mental illness. Those were just the reasons my family would use to ignore the deeper stuff. I miss my children every single day, but I\u2019ve learned that in time, things will fix themselves. Crying and being depressed won\u2019t bring my children back to me. I\u2019m now free from the chains of my trauma, my addiction and my mental illness. I live in a great community and am very blessed to be a nanny and help others with their children. I live now knowing I\u2019m doing my best with every single day and never take life for granted. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll Bite. As I've stated in the past, I believe it is better to have a general sense of what you want to do in the long term and set short term goals that make you happy or provide a challenge or satisfaction. My life has always been a bit of a random walk. We are never in control of what happens in the next moment. So much of life is determined by randomness and luck. However no matter who you are or what challenges you face now, there is always hope. Achieving small short term goals feeds hope and can transform hope into expectation. Note that in the list that follows, I never set a goal of \"happiness\", \"success\", or \"wealth\". The only time I focused on money was when a friend and I were going out for lunch and we both mentioned we had very little saved for retirement. That comment spawned a partnership that earned us both a retirement fund. I have always pursued short term goals that made me happy or gave me a deep sense of satisfaction. Often the goals required developing skills over a long period of time. Sometimes it was fun, sometimes frustrating. Now and again I had significant setbacks as projects were cancelled or startup companies failed. As for love or relationships, I feel this does not lend itself to goal setting. How can we possibly know who we will meet tomorrow. To set a goal in love is to be unrealistic. Goals I've set and achieved: Before 20: 1. Get the highest grades in my year after screwing around for years and not caring. 2. Leave home as soon as possible. 3. Enroll at Antioch College, liberal work/study. 4.Get off campus housing 5.Using cookbooks, learn to cook meals from scratch. 6.Retire at 30 (a thought ,not a true goal and not realized).

Retire at 40 (not a true goal, failed) 23. Take a winter backpacking trip (one week) out of Yosemite Valley. 24. Summit one of the peaks (Mt Adams) in the presidential range New Hamshire in Winter. Before 40: 25. Continue playing competitive racquetball. 26. Learn to Fly small planes 27. Continue to exercise practically every day 28. Maintain my weight 29. Purchase a ski cabin with a friend. 30. Lean to ski proficiently. 31. Enter ski races. 32. Continue growing as a Software Development Engineer in the Bay Area 33.

Retire at 50 (I never really worked toward this goal = never happened) 38. Develop significant navigation products (received email from a pilot who stated \u201cmy\u201d device saved his life). 39.

It was all a dream, but it was the clearest dream i\u2019d ever had. It was the beginning of my premonitive deja vu. A few months later, i found the rock, the same day I saw the clouds in the exact way they were when I dreamt of them. After that day, I realized the deja vu was the way to point myself in the right direction. If i recognize it, it\u2019s supposed to happen. I actually own some animals I once dreamed about. Most recently our gray kitten, who showed up in a moving dream 7 months before he existed. I\u2019ve worked in places previously shown to me in dreams as well. The most notable was a purple dragon in a restaurant I spent almost three years in. Most recently, my dreams have been really telling. Big changes are afoot. I just need to trust that everything is as it needs to be, as it always was. Trust yourselves. ",

A life of learning \u2026 to unlearn everything I never went to school until the ripe old age of 12. Then I finished all my formal schooling by 17 \u2014 with pretty solid exam results. Then I went to uni for a three-year bachelor\u2019s degree. In all, eight years from start to finish in the educational timeline.

It was entirely on the strength of my English-language abilities, not even on any formal paperwork. I\u2019ve been doing that for 30+ years until I switched to printing. Uni graduates in Literature or similar didn\u2019t get the job. No, I didn\u2019t have to sleep with the publisher to land that job. I didn\u2019t even have to sit next to her, in fact. However, my first-ever \u2018real\u2019 job (in the sense of \u2018salaried\u2019) was a labtech for a London teaching hospital. In those days, labtechs didn\u2019t need anything more than a couple of O-levels and one A-level. It paid so insultingly badly that I didn\u2019t have enough money to buy petrol to drive to work. I packed it in after 7 months. REAL BRAGGING RIGHTS  First home I bought my first home in London at age 19. Almost identical to the pic. Price paid \u00a321,000.

When I resettled abroad, sold it for \u2026 well \u2026 let\u2019s not talk about that \u2026 and I\u2019ve been regretting it ever since \u2014 because I\u2019d never imagined the price could hit \u00a3500,000 today!  The Isle of Man TT Motorcycle Race The TT (\u2018Tourist Trophy\u2019) motorcycle race is by reputation the world\u2019s toughest motorcycle competition. I entered the TT at the tender age of 19 or 20. I passed the entrance requirements, but failed in the first run. Such is life\u2026  3M Panaflex sheeting I first introduced the 3M Panaflex signage and awning material to Hong Kong back in the 1980s. But I got not a cent from it. The sheeting material wasn\u2019t taken enthusiastically by the local market, and some thought it was unsuitable for the local situation. So I dropped championing it. And then it suddenly took off and I couldn\u2019t get a way back into the racket.  Concorde tickets I bought 12 Concorde tickets for London-New York at surrealistically dirt-cheap prices. I also bought a stash of other tickets on regular planes. The lowest priced was just \u00a31. This was during the famous \u201cair ticket war\u201d in the 1980s, principally between British Airways and the now-defunct Laker Airways. The ladies suddenly saw me super cool, a super wantable jetsetter (short-lived, but still). I gifted some tickets to my friends, and so blimmin\u2019 happy they were I have never seen in anyone before or since.  Matte coated magazine paper I\u2019m the first person to print trade and fashion magazines on matte 60 gsm paper in Hong Kong in 1987 as \u201chouse default.\u201d Up to then, such magazines were roundly printed in heavy 100\u2013110 gsm glossy sized paper for full-colour printing.

My blog, The Naked Listener\u2019s Weblog, was launched sometime in 1995\u201396 \u2014 you can tell from the word \u201cweblog\u201d that it\u2019s oldskool enough. Won two awards for the crap I churn out on a regular, consistent and frequent basis over the years \u2014 until I injured my right shoulder in an industrial accident (and coming on to Quora!). Gone through four different hosting providers (ibm.net, GeoCities, Windows Live Spaces, and now WordPress). I think that\u2019s quite enough bragging for one day, don\u2019t you? Thanks for the A2A.

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a tricky question to answer. Especially as a parent and husband. Personal life- Overcoming the issues from my first marriage, which was very unhealthy, and marrying a wonderful woman. We often joke that we would both be more likely to be struck by lightening and attacked by a polar bear (here in Louisiana) on the same day then to get remarried when we did. We both had several younger kids. I had four kids of which three were under the age of seven. She had three kids with two of them below there teen years. We worked really hard to provide them all a stable environment full of opportunities. We didn\u2019t do the flashy stuff, but we did provide them with a good start. We are still very involved in their lives and are extremely blessed. Professional life- That one is a wild ride. Being honorably discharged from the Marines and play football at the collegiate level were really good things. I didn\u2019t finish college, which I still regret at times, but I did end up getting several higher level IT certifications. I used the work ethic instilled in me by my parents to work my way from menial jobs into a career in tech. That I parleyed into a, still continuing, thirteen plus year consulting business. My most significant accomplishment would have to be integrating wireless network handhelds into a maintenance group. The software we used (Computerized Maintenance Management System) called a CMMS did not support using the handheld interfaces wirelessly. I had conversations with the company and all of these add=ons to the systems were in there infancy. The more I researched and dug the more I realized I was quite alone in this endeavor. Everyone sees maintenance, delivery, and logistics personnel using wireless handhelds today, but in the early part of this century, not so much. I still remember standing, starkly alone, in the middle of our office building completing my first wireless sync of the handheld to the CMMS. I was jumping up and down. Pretty silly I know. The next day, after passing on my latest results, I was on a conference call with the software company, the owner, their leadership, entire software staff, and sales VP. They grilled me for a couple of hours and set up several follow up calls. I ended up doing more than fifty conference appearances about all of these things for several years. When at Tulane University we asked if we could present at the regional conference, for all the southeastern schools, and they laugh at us. A year later the head of the conference was calling us asking that we do a presentation. Pretty cool. ",

We all know that love, friendship, and whatnots are also achievements but I don\u2019t want to get boring or predictable. My greatest achievement is when I won this writing contest. I mean, yeah it\u2019s nice and all but here\u2019s the catch\u2014it\u2019s supposed to be in Filipino. I am not good in my iwn language since I grew up with my aunts and uncles teaching me English and then I went to a private school and then I have a lot of foreign and aboad relatives so I suck at Filipino. The writing contest was to talk about why Filipino is a great language and I did it with my own style. I wrote it as if I was casually talking to the reader. I used facts and also, real-life situations. It wasn\u2019t the best but it was everything my heart and brain could say. I was contented and passed it and left the other students. The vicctory would\u2019ve been sweeter if I was there but I was sick and tired that I stayed home and binged-watched The Flash. My sister came and announced the news and it was so awesome. I\u2019m still 15 so there may be a lot of oppurtunities for best achievements in the future. ",

            "answer_text": "My best achievement till date is clearing my CSIR-NET exam and simultaneously caring for my twin daughters who were 3 years old and required my attention all the time. This might look too less for other people but to me it was the greatest balancing act. I did not have a mother-in-law to help and my mother would not willingly help me achieve my aspiration for she believed that my duty was only towards my twin daughters and was never towards myself. I had a father-in-law who believed that the daughter-in-laws duty was to simply keep feeding him every 2 hours with fresh food and beverages. He had purchased a maid servant without wages. The saddest part was he would cook and eat what he made for 10 days but if the daughter-in-law cooked, it had to be fresh every time. I did not have time to stand up and fight for all this. So I decided that I will instead do everything everyone wants and my sleep time I would use to study for the exam. My husband was not earning enough to support all of us so I managed a college teaching job, taking extra IIT/PMPD classes, cooking taking care of my daughters driving them to hospitals at night when they got sick, entertaining my father-in-laws brothers and friends and balancing my college job simultaneously. I would study from 10 pm to 2 pm and be up at 5 am to start the next days cooking. I would some how catch 5 hours of study in a day and continued like this for a year. I cleared the exam in my third attempt and was ecstatic. In a similar fashion I took 19 years to complete my PhD. To people reading my biodata it is just another exam and another degree. But the amount of trials and tribulations and the hard work and efforts I put in not just in my subject but in my family environment to get there was toooo much. It becomes extremely difficult to explain to interview boards as to why I took 19 years to complete PhD and why there is no continuous service etc. It is also unfair to have age limit of 35 years in all job opportunities. I am touching 45 years and as a married woman only now I am free to study or work as I want but when I see these age limit I really think it is unfair.  ",

            "answer_text": "Writing my first poem. I was in Grade 9. My mind started wandering in the middle of class, and I pondered all sorts of inane things. The fan chopped overhead, barely providing any respite from the oppressive July heat. The teacher droned on about gravity, but my mind refused to obey fundamental physical rules and drifted out into the tepid garden through a window near the ceiling. I turned to the last page of my notebook and my hand grasped the pen, suddenly inspired. This is what I came up with: She was a blue rose, Floating high on a sea of green Yet concealed by a sea of red Alone, rueful, surrounded by the barrier Of her beauty. So real, but seemingly impossible. So lovely But still a mistake. And as the glorious summer sun Was replaced by winter\u2019s pale disk The blue rose shone ever brighter While the sea of red receded. Alone, unloved, the blue rose waited A solitary speck on the ice While around her the snow melted And once again there were stirrings of life. Once again the sun glowed bright And the sea of red returned But this time the blue rose was too tired to fight So she withered and died. Upon my mother's insistence, I submitted this poem to an online magazine and received an editor's choice award. It was one of the proudest moments of my life. ",

            "answer_text": "Asked to Answer:My biggest achievements in my life so far are the below 1) Understanding the exact mix of emotions I feel at any given point of time  and analysing the root of that emotion 2) Realising that a human mind can achieve anything with the right attitude and right planning 3) Realising the power of thought and understanding it's impact on life. For eg:  analysing the current situation of mind and finding the primary root thought that lead me here. To make it more clear. Right now im working as a analyst in stock market. Now if i dig deeper and think what lead me here, this would talk me back to my childhood days when my dad used to talk about legends of Indian stock market and also how many of his friends lost money as  bed time stories. He used to tell me that it's risky and very rare to be successful in stock market Wait it doesn't stop here When I dig much deeper i realised the basic root THOUGHT of mine.That is \" I DECIDED TO PROVE MY DAD THAT I CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN STOCK MARKET \" this made me work towards my goal. analysing deeper like about gave me lot of clarity of my mind and my actions and helped me to clear and filter my current thoughts that could impact my future. 4) Understanding the power of positive thinking 5) I can condition my brain according to the output I want. I can throw in any emotion and leverage it to create beliefs in my brain to drive me towards my goals. Understanding the above lead to many achievements and material benefits in my life with utmost happiness and mental peace. Have a happy life ahead :) ",

            "answer_text": "Graduating from one of the top public universities in the country with a difficult Biology major despite not being passionate about the subject, making it that much more difficult. When college started, I was pushed by overly-intrusive parents to be a doctor (aka the immigrant parent dream). I pleaded my case but you just cannot reason with some people, as I eventually found out. I was unhappy, miserable, and unfulfilled in what were supposed to be the best years of my life. At the time, I lacked the spine to stand up to overbearing parents who had no moral compass, if they wanted something done then they would use any manipulative trick to get it done. So there I was, miserable, and functioning on maybe 50% of my potential. The 50% number is very optimistic but regardless, I sat through classes like Biochemistry, Genetics, Organic Chemistry (1 and 2), and a rigorous pre-med curriculum made to weed you out. By the time I realized how bad of a situation I was in, I was too far along to switch majors. I could have dropped out, gave up, switched majors anyways to prolong college even more, or even have given up on life. Instead, I put my head down and powered through it. I graduated with a degree in a difficult track and from a top-tier institution. I also walked away with some key lessons. Do not let others determine your path in life, no matter how close you are to them.Life is pretty miserable when you are not doing something you are passionate about, so do things you are passionate about.When someone is doing anything unjust to your life, stand up to them, tell them it is not okay, even if it is your parents.",

            "answer_text": "Identifying thoughts and separating myself from them. I've been a pessimist since childhood. I always used to think in the negative. Then a crisis happened when I failed to qualify for medical entrance exams and had to do engineering. My negative thoughts worsened. Also because of the fact that I broke up with my the then boyfriend. It wasn't until much later in life that I realized that I failed to get into medicine due to my neglect and not because I'm not capable of it. I did well in engineering and managed to get into an NIT ( a national institute of technology) for my masters. I was happy. A good student. Until the completion of my masters. I didn't want to do a PhD. I didn't know what to do. Negativity increased and I started falling prey to anxiety again. But thankfully things changed. Now I'm doing my PhD under a very good supervisor. Still I'm always anxious. I'm afraid I might not make it. However in the past year, I've begun dissociating negative thoughts. I've managed to witness a thought, and let it pass, without reacting to it. I read a lot of self help material and through that I've come to realize that our thoughts are not us. It was ridiculous at first, but now I can tell which thought is mine and which is noise. Sometimes I'm exasperated at having spent almost all my life enslaved to bad thoughts. Bad thoughts are not bad, so long as you identity them and gently put them aside. Looking forward to more Zen ! For this, I thank @Dushka Zapata, her books were a savior. I highly recommend reading them if you are searching for meaning. I also follow Kris Gage in medium. She writes amazing introspective stuff. I read one article of her everyday :) ",

            "answer_text": "I really can\u2019t take any credit for anything I\u2019ve done in my life. I never had the power to orchestrate events or achieve wordly status, which by the way, have never been on my list of what is important in life. My greatest achievement that earmarks who I am was my choice to receive Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior, who died to save me from my sins. Since then, I am empowered by the Holy Spirit who operates in me and through me for God\u2019s glory. I\u2019ll tell you who I\u2019m not . . . I\u2019m not a college graduate or a scholar. I\u2019m not certified, ordained, credentialed, licensed, accredited or approved by the state. I\u2019m not the president of anything, not on the board of anything, nor am I the leader of anything. I\u2019m not famous or well known. My name or picture isn\u2019t on the cover of any magazine, and I don\u2019t own any trophies or awards for a recognized accomplishment. But I know who I am . . . I am God\u2019s beloved created in His image; forgiven, cleansed, set free and growing in grace. I\u2019ve been purchased by His blood, and have hope alive in my heart. I am uniquely special to him, carved in the palm of his hand, and of significant worth. I\u2019m not bragging, I just know these things about myself. I value my role as a woman, a wife, a mother, a friend, a sister, a neighbor, an employee, and a mentor; I bloom where I am planted. By the world\u2019s standards I\u2019m not highly appraised . . . I\u2019ve been used, labeled, numbered, judged, categorized, controlled, manipulated, hired, fired, ridiculed, belittled, slandered, humiliated, shamed, threatened, criticized, and degraded. I\u2019m not anybody\u2019s boss nor do I climb the corporate ladder. I\u2019ve never been nominated for anything, nor have I ever gotten voted into anything. I haven\u2019t copyrighted anything, discovered, invented or patented anything. I never appeared on TV, nobody\u2019s written a review on me, or asked for my autograph. I\u2019ve never been called a hero, and I don\u2019t own any medals of honor. I never reached the top ten of anything, and my community doesn\u2019t even know I exist. By the world\u2019s standards I haven\u2019t accomplished much of anything. But I know who I am . . . An adopted child of God, alive in Christ, and empowered by the Holy Spirit with a peace in my heart that comes from a Heavenly Father who loves me unconditionally. Many who claim to know me cannot discern my worth; it is invisible to them. No one sees when I encourage or comfort someone slipping into despair. No one sees when I serve my family\u2019s needs, minister to the hurting, talk with the hopeless, labor over an important project, reach out to the lost, or spend time in prayer. No one ever sees when I go to my Heavenly Father to ask forgiveness, sometimes full of shame and grief. No one ever witnesses my answered prayers, or my victory over sin. These things only happen in the secret places of my relationship with God in the sanctuary of my heart. No organized system or institution on this earth owns the final authority to dictate or decide who I am. My infinite worth in God\u2019s eyes is immeasurable. Yes, I know who I am. . . I am God\u2019s masterpiece, redeemed, set apart, sanctified, and justified. I am chosen and called, reconciled and redeemed. He pays attention to me when I call out in prayer: sometimes rejoicing, and sometimes full of anguish. He carries me through every circumstance I face. He is with me always and I shall never fear what mere man thinks of me. My hope is in Christ. I am complete in him. \u201cLord, all that we have accomplished, you have done for us.\u201d Isaiah 26:12 ",

            "answer_text": "Ah, my single greatest achievement to date is to have rediscovered the joy of learning. The greatest failure of my life is that this rediscovery had not happened at an earlier age. For though there is the inclination to learn, there is not enough vitality and time to be apportioned among kinds of knowledge. So I have to make do with what is to me of immediate relevance. That the enthusiasm of my youth is once again mine is cause for contentment. But forced am I to funnel this enthusiasm into specific disciplines. Now, my greatest achievement is not an achievement in itself, but a key to a whole multitude of them. It may seem like I have hinged my hopes on a mere feeling; yet the best reward is the reward you give yourself-- everything else is just embellishment. I am not sure of winning accolades or prizes or laurels. But I am sure of one thing: I will do my job well and derive satisfaction from it. How did I achieve this? It was not a mere awakening to something better, but the product of an eon of brutally honest application of one primal question to the soul: Why should it be so? It was characterised by a long period that witnessed growing dissatisfaction with my complacent, selfless, \"yogi-like\", ways, and growing distrust in a spiritual world view. But I realised that the world in which I lived had more beauty, more novelty at least, than any speculated hereafter. I began to love the world and to honour that love I decided to get to know it better. Slowly but surely, this love began to encompass... or this interest began to encircle the inhabitants of this world. I realised that idle speculation about other worldly matters was a waste, if not abuse, of imagination. I have respected this world, and this world has in its turn healed me and allowed me to reap satisfaction, fulfillment. All I had to do was to understand that existence and the world are inseparable things, or at least to believe so. In line with my pragmatic approach to psychological matters, I have not sought to prove this, but accepted this as a matter to be resolved through subjective experimentation. And if the experiments of science propagate science, the experiments of life must enrich life. The future will vindicate me. ",

            "answer_text": "I woke up this morning to see this message from my best bud Shivani, on my smartphone.  And, almost every single morning, I wake up to such heartwarming words from both, fellows on Quora and off Quora. And, that is a big change in my life. Back when I had begun to write here, nobody gave a damn about me. No one but my mother cared if I am doing good or not. After all, I was a shitty person. With bloated ego and exasperating anger issues, I was not someone easy to deal with. I would hurt myself when angry, and at times end up getting into physical brawls. Resultantly, people began to detest me. They distanced themselves and abandoned me. But, I kept blaming them. I would feel left out and forlorn, but not cry. And, by not crying out my emotions, I would only keep them brewing up in my head over and over again, leading me into further vitiated and troublesome situations. Naturally, I was the problem. I was the wrong guy. Everyone had to hate me. Yes, I did have a lot of good traits too. But, when you have one strong bad trait, twenty other good ones rarely matter in the eyes of the people. So, no one gave a damn about me anymore. And, then came my break up. And, this broke me up so bad, that I finally gave in to some self-introspection. Us parting ways, it led me into thinking about what and when did things go so wrong. I thought a lot. You know, when you confine yourself to your dark room for over a month, and rarely go out, and do nothing but stick your eyes to YouTube all day long, you practically have a lot of time to think random shit. So, did I. The only difference was, I was thinking about every random shit that got between me and my ex, cascaded and eventually grew the divide amongst us to such heights that we ended up departing from each other's lives. And, it was then that I acknowledged for the first time, I had literally been a very shitty person. Very hard to deal with. And, I had issues. Ego. Anger. Dominance. Aggressiveness. Impulse reactions. Those had all gotten the better of me all that time. No doubt, I also had a lot of things to list down that she did wrong. But, I now also acknowledged things that I did wrong. The debacle of that first relationship, it surfaced my flaws and burns, and that made me finally see them for real. And, thus, I took on the decision to transform my life. I decided to reinvent myself. I decided I had lived long enough by the principles, ethos and norms that everyone had been preaching into my ears since birth. It was about time, I began to ask questions and choose to abide by the laws and tenets which truly made sense to me. And, I did that. I read plenty of books. I would note down every single idea or thought which I would feel like I could implement in my life in the form of a 30-day challenge to build a habit and also push me beyond my comfort zone. And, then I would pursue them. I would fail at some. And, I would succeed at some. But, every next week, I would be taking up new challenges to experiment with. At any given time, I would be engaged in over 10 such challenges towards building righteous habits and ultimately re-building myself. These challenges would be as simple as brushing my teeth twice every day. And, some of these would be bit tougher ones like performing 300 pushups every day. The first one would help me conquer my mind while helping me develop better oral hygiene. The latter one would help me build better physique while giving a big fillip to my devastated self-esteem and confidence. These are just two examples. And, eventually, with repeated such challenges of so many different kinds, extended over two years now, I am what I am. I am nothing I used to be. Nothing. I own my mother's trust to the extent I never used to. Because I simply stopped lying to her. I have super closed knit of select few bed buds. Because I cut myself off over eighteen so-called friends consuming my time and energy and invested it all into just five, who truly loved me. I am a budding writer, with my first book currently under works. So, I have a direction, a sense of career in my head, and a zeal which drives me. Back then, I didn't have any. I was a shitty writer. And, in these two years, I built one into myself. I practised, I got better, and am still learning every day. And, remember my anger and ego issues? Trust me, I crushed those all, drank them, and then shat them into the loo the next day. Not really. It was tough to better myself on those fronts. But, I have come a long long way. I rarely lose my temper, and that is again a big change in my attitude. Some of the habits which helped me in this regard were to just keep my mouth shut and listen to others. Especially if they would be sharing something that would be contrary to my beliefs. Things that would get me pumping to utter out my opinions. I would force myself to keep myself shut and listen. This helped me build a leverage against the dominance that my ego and haphazard mind had over me. Another tenet that helped me with anger issues was to never take anything personally. I sdopted this lesson from the book, \u201cThe Four Agreements.\u201d People mostly deal with shit or say shit, or throw shit on others. And, they do it because of problems in their own lives and not because you are the problem. And they just fail to see it. And, if you fail to see it too, then you are bound to lose temper, and lambast at them. But, once you realize this, then practically there is no reason to be angry on them, but to feel bad for them. I kept learning and adopting more of such lessons day after another reading from masterful life-changing authors like James Altucher, Derek Sivers, Don Miguel Ruiz, Hal Elrod, Dr Kalam, and Robin Sharma. Each book would leave me with so many filled A4 sheets full of ideas and principles whose adoption in my life would help me become a better person. And, eventually, it\u2019s implementation of all those things which completely transformed me. The changes seemed to be incremental. But, now when I look back, I realize that it was all transformational. And, here I learned another lesson. Big things happen small. Ergo, I began to implement this lesson learnt into all other aspects of my life. I would dream big. Then, I would break those dreams into much smaller milestones. And, my goal would no longer be the previous big dream. My only goal would be to get to the next milestone. And, this helped me immensely. That is how I have gotten to this present heyday that I live. And, here is another thing. At every step, I was writing about everything that I was going through. Every challenge, every experiment, every principle that I practised or imposed over myself learning from any of the books or certain people, I wrote about it all here on Quora. Initially, people would often impugn my answers as fake. But, one cannot go one to being fake for over two years, extending the same story on and on and on. And, a lot of people saw it too. A few of them, they took my reinvention as an inspiration to get started on their own rebuilding projects as well. Some others, adopted certain 30- day challenges that I had been pursuing. And, a lot of others would stay connected to learn more about how I had been progressing, transforming and reinventing myself from time to time. And, remember how I mentioned in the beginning of this post, I was a person who no one gave a damn about? Fast forward to this day, there are a few people who do give a damn about me. There are a few who take time out of their lives to text me or message me such words as one I shared up there.  And, that is my biggest achievement so far. Almost every day in these two years, I have been achieving this in teeny tiny parts, which when I think about it, I never realized grew so big! I never realized I could be an inspiration to someone. But, there are a few who say I am. And, that is the big achievement I have made. When people message me, your parents must be so lucky to have a son like you. When people message me I am going to make my father proud one day. When someone tells me that they would love to see their kids grow up and be like me. When someone tells me that they want their future children to be just like me. When someone tells me that any girl would be lucky to have someone like me. When someone tells me that they decided to not commit suicide after having read my answers. When someone tells me that they are going to take certain steps inspired from my journey to become a better person. When someone tells me that they want a signed copy of my first book whenever it comes out. At each of those moments I realize it again and again and again with a big smile on my face and some water in my eyes- Yes, I have surely achieved something big. Bliss!

My mother worked shift jobs, but was expected to carry out the Indian daughter-in-law duties while my grandmother looked after my older sister and I. We never got much time with her growing up. My father worked outside of the UK and so we never saw him either. School was tough for me, I started in special needs because everyone thought I had learning disabilities due to being deaf. Turns out, I only had a stigmatism in my eyes. The issue was solved with my glasses, but this put me on the back foot and set a precedent for how the first part of my academic life turned out. In high school, I just wanted to keep my head down and do work. But I got bullied often and we were still struggling with money - kids used to pick on my shoes etc. It was relentless. My parents were arguing a lot, there was alcohol, there was abuse. I\u2019ve had to physically defend my mother and sister from my dad more times than I should\u2019ve. The shining light during this time is that I found a friend here - she was amazing and essentially became my sister. We shared our struggles together and I found relief in her company. During A-levels (16\u201318 y.o.) the arguments persisted with my parents. But I moved to a new school and made new friends. It was much better here but I did struggle academically. I failed my exams and didn\u2019t get into the university I wanted. But I persisted and attended my back up choice. Here, life changed. New city, new friends, new place. The shining light I spoke about earlier became my girlfriend and it was incredible riding this wave of independence with her. Through this university, I was able to work in China and live in Amsterdam for one year. I finished my degree with a first-class honours after four years - what could get better? Next up was my master\u2019s. Here I met an incredible group of people who I\u2019m so proud to class as family. We worked hard, played harder and I\u2019ve watched them grow into their success. However, the shining light started to fade. Our relationship was failing and in June 2018, we broke up. This was a seismic shift in my life. I suffered from anxiety and panic attacks as she said things to me like \u2018I\u2019ve stopped thinking about death since I\u2019ve stopped seeing you\u2019. I was unable to eat or sleep. This lead to a massive drop in my weight. But as with all things, you rebound the negativity into something positive. One year later, I\u2019m the fittest I've ever been. I\u2019m moving country to Switzerland and making an absurd amount of money for someone my age. I\u2019m able to support my family, see my friends around the world and slowly become the man I wish I had in my life. Where I am now, the experiences I\u2019ve had, my new job and new home are my biggest achievement. The life I lead now was a distant dream to the boy I used to be. So cheers to the good life. ",

            "answer_text": "My baby sister is 5 years younger to me and currently pursuing MBBS from China. She studies 27 hours a day (her words) and will be a kickass surgeon one day. Mummy, Papaji and myself are all eagerly waiting for that beautiful day. Five years back when she discovered that medicine is her true calling, she knew she only wanted to do MBBS. She couldn't get a government college seat and we weren't affluent enough to pay the hefty donations all the private institutions were demanding. She took a drop, and prepared even more rigorously. Even though her efforts were top notch, the stiff competition and heavily politicized system beat her. It was then we found this university in China where she would get in on merit and not on donation and the overall expenditure, although hefty for us, would be spanned out across 5 years and it would still be less than the big donation amount the private colleges were demanding to give a seat. She cleared the same and at the young age of 18, she took the bold step to move to China and has never looked back. It was a big cultural shock for her, and along with the highly demanding academics, she had to manage everything else (literally) on her own. My baby sister, who hadn't even deposited a cheque in the bank, managed everything beautifully. She learnt to read, write and speak their language, found a house on her own, managed her finances every month and cracked all the exams every semester. She made alot of mistakes along the way but learnt and emerged stronger everytime. My parents managed the funds for her in the initial years, they pooled in their savings, took education loans etc. Then sometime back I too started earning well and took over for my parents and started to contribute financially for her education and monthly expenses. It's been 2 years that I've been earning well. My fellow colleagues have saved enough to purchase a car, travel abroad, give down payment for a flat, buy gold etc, but I have minimal to zero savings, and I couldn't be more satisfied. My parents look at me with pride and my sister is giving it her all in that foreign land. My friend Talha told me these words which touched me - \"You're an enabler Suvadra. You're enabling your sister to learn and achieve her dream. We are proud of you.\" i believe seeing my infant sister grow into this excellent human being and assisting this lady on the way to come to be a doctor, is my biggest accomplishment. Every time she saves a life, I would personally understand that I am an integral part of it. :) P.S: That's my sibling within the image. Kindly deliver some blessings and positive energy the girl way.  ",

I left my home for study when i was just 14-15 years old to prepare for IIT and AIEEE. Since then with continuous hardwork and support of my family, i have achieved so many things which i never imagined of.   1. Before going to prepare for IIT and AIEEE, i didn't have any idea about these exams. As i was good in study so one of our relative suggested to prepare for these exams.  I secured AIR - 16752 in IIT-JEE and AIR - 14266 in AIEEE in first attempt and I got admission in NIT jamshedpur.  2. In final year, i was placed in L&T construction. At that time, it was biggest achievement for me as basic motto of my life was to support my family financially.  3. As the basic motto of my life was to support my family financially so i never thought of preparing for ESE and GATE but my manager in L&T was an A** h***. His behavior forced me to quit the job and this was very crucial for me as the basic Motto of my life was failed here. But somehow my family managed it and after 1 year of hardwork i secured AIR 11 in GATE 2018 and was selected for all the major PSU's JOB. Basic motto again fulfilled.  4. I also appeared for ESE along with GATE and it's result was announced when i was working in ONGC and i secured AIR-62 in it. I resigned from ONGC and Currently i am working as an Assistant Director in Central Water Commission under Ministry of Jal Shakti.  5. Along with all these things, the respect that me and my family has earned in these years is unimaginable.   So this is my journey from AIR-16752 to AIR-62 or i can say from a small town boy to an Officer in Central Government.  Thanq for reading !! ",

            "answer_text": "My greatest achievement in my life was writing my book. I have always wanted to write a book but thought I could never do. I came from a very abusive family where my dad made sure I didn\u2019t do my homework or read my school books. I graduated from high school barely passing. I could hardly comprehend reading or write well. Felt like I was graduating from middle school than high school. When my past haunted me, I started writing to get the trauma out of my head. I was no longer able to suppress it anymore, and was told that I was weak if turned for help. There were times I didn\u2019t know where I was or what I was doing. I was even not sure the time period. My book is done entirely by myself: the writing, the editing, the formatting, and the designing. I took my book off the market so I could change the title and edit it better. In May of this year, I will put it out on the market. Then work on two books along the children stories for my children book. The two books will be out this year. They are already written but need to do the editing. I wanted to show others that even deprived of a proper education, anything was possible if one put her mind to it. My new book title: In the Jungle My home during the Vietnam War Old title: On my Own How I survived the Vietnam War I finally got something that I have always wanted, and it made up for the hard life I lived thru: I could draw. I never drew anything my entire life. One day, I looked at someone\u2019s drawing that he was going to use for wood carving. No telling myself that I couldn\u2019t do it. I just grabbed a pencil and drew it in two hours. In a month I drew things that would take someone a year to do. I felt as if God finally gave me something to make up my suffering from the Vietnam War and severe child abuse. ",

On a larger social level, I ran a program that had 1100 apartment buildings and 110,000 tenants with a $110M that were abandoned by the owners in New York City. The prior winter 12 people froze to death in those buildings, there was very little sanitation, heat and they had turned into the worst of the worst. For three years I restructured management, hired three dozen Ivy League management graduates, and threw a number of people in jail. I also formed a Participatory Management scheme for the 3200 employees. The best part is no one died from freezing or sanitation issues, and it was the beginning of turning around neighborhoods. I am not bragging, but I am very proud of what everyone involved accomplished. ",

We had not taken our meal to eat in recreation time. There was not a person to guide in our study and career. Mother had arrenged a tuition master, to whom we had been paying tuition fee after harvesting of peddy. She had great expectation that study is the vital instrument to make a drastic change in someone lives. It is a universal truth too. Frankly speaking we were lacking of the basic needs of life. We had hardly enough for survival. As you know time heals everything. Time flies and my study was going on. As a lower class people we had not a concrete particular goal in life. I had just a aim to get a Government Job and to be a reason of my parents happiness. I began to prepare for a government job since after my post graduation. I devoted the best I could in my preparation. I had been giving competitive examination, fortunately after one and half year of preparation I got a Government clerical job in the District Administration. My parents became happy so as me. But the harsh reality was that I had not enough salary to boost up my family condition. The dependent and to do list was large. The same principle was applied once again to devote time on study to get a gob at higher level. In this time my dream had been specific, the only job I had to crack was of my parential subject specific. Fortunately, I did it once again with my labor and devotion. Now, my parents and siblings are happy. I have now the ability to make them happy and to fill their long awaited dream to avail the basic need of life. \u201c Hard work, dedication and sincerity pay back with overloaded happiness. Have a clear vision and go on. Once you decide to achieve anything in your life, you are unstoppable\u201d This is my first answer on quora. Your sincere correction will be highly appreciated. ",

I would break it down to three major areas. Academic, work and love. This is the first time I think about it. Academically somebody called me an over achiever. I take it as an insult. I was a high achiever, but it did not come with great difficulty. Actually I only got a masters degree, but instead of going for Phd I opted to lean accounting and get a designation beside my science degree. So academically I was a high achiever. At work I had management positions as high as being the chief financial officer for the entire Canadian part (several plants) of an international organization. So, I guess my working career was also successful. What about love? I was happily married to my first and only love for 64 years. Actually we were engaged before being married for 3 years. So it is a 87\u201368 years of deep and true love affair. So was my life successful? It all seems to me like a beautiful dream. Was it really true? I lost my husband, the love of my life almost a year ago. Now I am a lonely 85 year old woman. Retired from my job over 65 years ago. Nobody knows me there any more. And academics? Trying to see what is new in science since I graduated. In one word: everything. Theoretical physics hardly existed, it was all classical. And there are new branches of mathematics to support the new physics. So much for a successful life! ",

Many of you may wonder why I chose my children and my marriage as my greatest achievements in my life and for me the answer is pretty simple. We are here for a short time, we come in to the world alone and go out the same way, however who we share our lives with and the family we have are the MOST important parts of our lives.After all what does any materials ever mean when we're no longer around?

My father died at the age of 44 and I was hardly 12 then. From then on, I interfaced with adults and tried to earn a few morsels for myself. Thus from 1958 onward, I have managed to live an honorable life. A couple of months in 1958 as an apprentice artist in a press was the start. Then I was lucky to be sent to school for matriculation. In 1962, I did a clerical job for four months before joining government service in 1963 as telegraphist. I started my studies thereafter before deciding to become an engineer in my own department. The journey started from 1966 finally retiring in 2007. I am enjoying a pensioner\u2019s life. I think my biggest achievement has been to STAY HONEST, HARDWORKING AND CONTRIBUTING INDIVIDUAL ALL ALONG without getting negative tags and labels even for a smallest misdoing. This is not easy to do; I rode merrily on divine support, and that is a great achievement from my point of view. ",

Success with hobbies, milestones in athletic pursuits, academic victories etc. There are three accomplishments that stand out in my life so far. First is that I've managed to amass many good friendships that will never ever tarnish and still no true enemies. Second is that I grew up with a verbally abusive and alcoholic dad, with an older brother who has aspergers. It was for a long time, a rough household to live in. Third was overcoming severe ADHD \u2014 symptoms after coming off of over a decade of gradually increased medication. Doing a backfill or 30 pull ups or memorizing 100 digits of pi were all fun things to achieve (oh yes i did) but those three things above were the most critical to my life and who I really am. But hopefully my next achievement will be getting a million dollars and buying a Sick AF Villa house. ",

            "answer_text": "When asked about achievements, we do relate it with our academics and yes why not, in today\u2019s life the thing which is taking up maximum of us and eating our days is somehow related to academics. So to answer it, i was never a even \u2018Fine\u2019 kind of student in performing over in examinations, So keeping that in mind, Parents had a tough time with me everytime explaining me to study, which i did though, but never managed to grab good or even okie sort of grades. And as a result, When u\u2019r living in an INDIAN society , everyone from ur milkman, to one of ur dear friend/relative judge u on basis of ur grades, do give their advice, without keeping in mind that may be advice does not cost them anything, but it is worth a lot, so not to give it like for granted\u2026 and make sure, if u give one, should be justified and surely u have examined the issue and put yourself in former person\u2019s shoe first. So taking it back to the time when i aspired that i would like to have \u2018Biology\u2019 as a subject choosen after 10th and move ahead and work for becoming a Doctor, coz something in me was continously pushing me to choose it and work accordingly( as it was also a subconcious expectation of my Father).However the thought of having other subjects like maths or other streams of science deterred me from doing that. But still , crossing the expectation of my parents and performing better than that i got Grade I marks in the boards, for which i got praised and got to hear things like. \u201c this was never expectd of you\u201d \u201c You performed good\u201d etc etc, which at one place was giving me good feeling, but something in me asked me, did i just deserved this much even after doing and performing much better compared to the performances i gave earlier. Taking forward , i ended up taking, rather choosing \u2018Commerce\u2019 as my crib , not knowing to do ,what in future! But yes i worked hard, gave enough and performed quite better this time and got some decent percentage i.e. 75% in my 12th boards , which was kind of showing that , from being a duffer, i\u2019ve become an average student. This was a sort of and infact was an acievement for me and at same time made parents Happy! Time to decide what to do in future, which line to go, MBA\u2019s, Law,CA,CS etc etc. Don\u2019t ask me for what reason, but i Chose CA( not chose, rather decided i should start it), which in due course proved me, that some big decisions taken without giving much of thought may go bad big time. And even after clearing my CPT( phase 1 of CPT, with much of efforts and pushing myself for it) and completing my articleship, i could not perform well and was not able to clear PCC. As a result, went hopeless and broke down with thoughts how can i clear it and what i should do to get a positive result. Gave up on CA( not totally, but after giving my last try and that too for both the groups at same time,for those who does not know there are 2 groups in intermediate or PCC what we say it) and went for preparations of MAT,CAT and other competitive exams for MBA. I performed out of this world( world includes only my performaces :D ) i got some 99.14 percentile in MAT( people may say its not a big deal, it was for me, when considering there\u2019s Maths into it). Hopes inflated ,start preparing for CAT,joined classes, studied for say 3 months or so, but in between some unexpected comes up\u2026 Wooah! Cleared PCC, both group at once, yeah! A magic moment it was and was shouting in my flat like fools, it was an achievement! Left behind everything, started preapring for Finals, wooah, happiness never faded for clearing the PCC both groups altogether ( and why not, in my family, was the only one who did that, yes i have more CA\u2019s in my family) , prepared for Finals, gave exams and boom, *flunked* Not a big deal, right,yes\u2026 but what happened actually is flunked and repeat, repeat for basically 4 times, till had that one group cleared, and more 5 times till the rest(basically the second group) cleared\u2026!!! Achievement, yes it is an for me, i did cleared them, when i saw everyone giving up on me(except my parents and sister,only one\u2019s i believe in) , made such fun of, adviced of doing things in addition or giving up on it, blamed and criticized for leaving the MBA\u2019s entrance in between, when was getting a good college already,\u2026 so basically surroundings was hostile to the decision, but yes! I achieved it, i took all the frustration, pain in me and let the working going on( for not i say, those who quitted, did not worked hard, they ofcourse did, even better than me, but i just decided to not to give up on it and situations were with me, i was lucky enough) So am a CA for now and for my this life and yes i achieved it and am the reason my parents have a pride feeling for me! ( May be there are many CA people around, but for my parents its just me and my Sister\u2764\ufe0f) Apart from this, i had achieved a special value in life, which i learned to have in one! It is Patience! Though one could not get enough of it and am still in learning phase, but i have it, maybe little. ",

            "answer_text": "My greatest achievement of life is \u2018to know myself and be myself\u2019.   In my younger days, I used to be like the people who are considered to be successful. However, soon I realized that there is no fixed formulae of success and everyone succeed in their own way. You can find bosses who perform well by putting their subordinates under tremendous pressure and you can also find bosses, who succeed without even raising their voice.  We admire Mahatma Gandhi who practiced nonviolence and we also admire Bhagat Singh who was a revolutionary.  There is a place for everyone in this world. When we try to become someone, we are under constant state of tension.  Please look the picture of two different springs in the figure below.   These springs are by design of different lengths. If you try to make the first spring to the size of later or vice-versa, both springs would be under the constant tension as they would be craving to come back to their natural size all the time.  We are like these springs. We are comfortable being ourselves.If we live the life of any other person, we can\u2019t be comfortable.   I have tried to discover myself and then redefine success and joy for me.  If I love reading and writing, I do it notwithstanding what other people think about it.   I don\u2019t force myself to imitate anyone or please anyone to win any favours from them. I don\u2019t bother if others consider me successful or happy as far as I am able to be myself and do the things that I like to do.  ",

            "answer_text": "After my marriage (24-year-old), my father passed way in 6 months due to the failure of his kidney and left my mother, 2 younger brothers, a sister as well as debt. And the same day I had to join my current company as a project engineer but death news broke me out. I hadn't informed my father about joining a new company because I wanted to surprise him. Instead of going to the office the first day I rushed to New Delhi railway station from Gurgaon and caught a train with my wife and arrived home the next morning. My family members were crying and people from the village were thinking that we had no future. Since I was the eldest sibling I hugged my both brothers and encouraged them by hope and I didn't cry in front of them. I studied the situation deeply and calmly and prepared a road map for the next 5 years. After a month I joined my company in Gurgaon and I took care of my family from there. I spent all my money on educating my brothers Sharad (21 yr old) Rajneesh (16 yr old) and kept them motivated. Since my father was a politician so I spend money on the welfare of people too. And I gave responsibility to my brother that he needs to go in politics and continue his studies as well. We worked very hard in order to convince people and after two years my mother won panchayat election and Sharad got a govt and now handling a construction business as well. My youngest brother is studying B.Tech 6 semester. Since we have earned money as well as respect. So people across my village tell our stories to their children. Now 5 years have been passed and I have become financially free from my family responsibilities. It makes very happy for any guardian if all family members do well. This is my greatest achievement. Cheers!!! Edit- Thanks for reading and upvotes ",

            "answer_text": "Accomplishment is something that if you accomplish one thing, you make efforts to accomplish another thing, which is tougher than the previous one. Also, what seems to be biggest accomplishment for you, maybe nothing in the eyes of other people. But when it comes to accomplishment, it not always be accolades, medals, appreciation, authority. It can be the tiniest of the thing, as in my case it was. In my school days, I have never been the sort of a person who talks a lot. And because of this reason, I was perceived as an arrogant personality, who is always indulged in her own world and considers no one as per her standards. Well, this wasn't true at all. I was quite because I hate backbiting or rather speaking all what I have heard. My classmates used to maintain a distance because they thought that I won't welcome them in my world. Eventually, with the passage of time, I tried to talk to people, so that I can prove them wrong to whatever extent possible. I tried to make friends but a few of them were only interested in my talks, and most of them were boys. After completing my SSC, I got my school changed and my new school was a girls school. Initially, I found it hard to make friends, but wasn't limiting myself to talking with only a few and avoiding the rest. I used to talk to everyone, be it my friend, or someone whom I didn't knew very well. Those two years passed by and finally it was the Farewell Day. That day, definitely I hold dear, I was being awarded the title of Miss Congeniality. This was an accomplishment for me, as it proved that I wasn't an introvert. The people who thought that I can not be good to others were proved wrong. In addition to it, I became more confident and I also got to know that there was nothing wrong with me. It was only the time and people's perception that defined me earlier, in my old school, with my earlier classmates and now with my new mates. ",

I\u2019ve watched films all my lie and have always written and so I entered - and was one of the winners\u2026 And then I had to tell my wife: Me: So what do you want to do to celebrate our anniversary? It\u2019s a big one. Her: Don\u2019t know. Any ideas? Me: How about a seeing a film? Her: That\u2019s a bit boring. Where? Me: The South of France, at the Cannes Film Festival\u2026 Her: WHAT??? And then the fun really started, as the Festival had strict dress codes: black tie for men (so new Dinner suit for me) and long dresses for women. We ended up in a smart dress shop in Oxford full of women buying gowns for end of term balls and/or family weddings. After waiting for a while the Formidable Proprietor approached us, sensing our need for a significant purchase. FP: And what is Madam\u2019s event? A college ball or a family wedding? My wife is a teacher and has a voice that can fill a school hall without difficulty and her reply was priceless. Wife: Neither. We\u2019re off to a gala screening at the Canes Film Festival. (Collapse of various stout parties in the shop). The weekend was amazing: we travelled to our hotel in a limo and the paps go really excited when we arrive d- until we got out\u2026 and the film was a let-down: Les Chansons d\u2019Amour - a French musical that (quite rightly) did not appear in any of the shortlists for prizes that year.

(2) Living in the moment and being fully present and engaged and activated; and everything that must be in place for this to occur, such as an acute self awareness and self respect, acceptance of what I cannot change, patience, discipline, etc. These two in combination are the utmost fulfilling and freeing \u201cthings\u201d I could have, and both have an exponentially significant impact on my daily life, well-being, healthiness, happiness and contentment.

It is a past achievement though shape my life later. I used  to travel office by bus. My office is very far from my company. My company is one end of the city and my home was in another end. I had to travel whole length of city to get my home. I had to change two buses. Around 3 hours it was taking to reach home. If traffic gets worsened it would take even more. Where I change my second bus is city's main bust stand. When I reach there I would find sea of humans. People are just desperate to get home soon. People are running here and there. Once I get down from my bus I rush to the platform for my second bus with the hope to get a seat. When I reach there already huge crowd swarming around the platform. All are looking at same direction, the direction from where bus would come. Once bus reaches the platform people would grab the door of bus and stick with it until bus stops and door open.Once Bus stops they would shove themselves inhumanly to get a seat into the bus not bothering that by their act one would get hurt. I witness this barbaric act standing away murmuring myself \"when people will learn to behave..they don't have any self-respect and they claim they live in civilised society!!, I would never do this, I could not have..\" Once this holocaust of humanity over I get into the bus where there is now even no place to step in. I get company of some tired disheartening faces panting with despair for not able to get seat. And  my journey of hell starts. Hanging up in one place for 2 hours makes every moment a nightmare what would hunt me even after I get down from bus when crawling literally to get home what has too long distance of walking. So same was the predicament for many days eventually it became unbearable.    So then this one of the biggest achievements of life came. Having achieved this I was sometimes, which was though unbelievable for me for some days, the first person who could get into the bus and grab the first seat at front row. (obviously window seat that is everyone's favourite and at least desire of that would be understandable to who went through my situation). Though it would look easy from outside yet mustering courage to become barbaric like others or even more than them was difficult for me. It took some days. And soon I learn the art of shoving myself shamelessly not giving heed to people. I just tread upon  my self-respect understanding else would be difficult to survive. When I was the first person grab the sit, my favourite window seat, the sense of satisfaction as if I had achieved something great was inexplicable. And in whole journey my mind my soul was in utter peace, that is too inexplicable.  I understand This would not be considered as an achievement but still after that I learn that this world is not a like five-star hotel and you are an esteemed guest in it where what you want would be served for you in not time but a place where you need to snatch it mercilessly as no one  bothers for you.

We pulled into a parking lot in front of a store in my neighborhood. One of the guys became threatening and was trying to make me give him money. We got out of the car, then the angry guy snatched my purse and began rummaging through it. When he couldnt find money, he stomped on my purse then shoved my forehead and demanded that I give him money. The guy who had been driving got out of the car to confront his angry friend, acting concerned about his crazy behavior. Suddenly a car sped in front of us and a man got in the crazy guy's face like Chris Brown! The man was my friend, the same one from my dream. I have so-called \u2018conjured' another friend and one acquaintance since this incident. ",

I have always struggled to get my viewpoints across and I don't know why. Also, I have struggled with anxiety for as long as I can imagine. Now that I am in a position of making a difference. It has dawned upon me that sometimes you have to try having been given the opportunity. I taught a lesson today to a class of 10 year olds. The concept was very difficult to explain to young children\u2026however I tried. To my surprise the children learned a few things in the lesson. To me that meant everything. I have never felt so satisfied. I want to make differences so that I can live to see those differences positively impact lives forever. It has made me acknowledge that it is the little achievements that can be magnified to fill in the wounds from yesterday. ",

            "answer_text": " Back in 2013 I took my first medical entrance exam, NEET. I got rank around 28000s. I couldn\u2019t clear that year. Later I joined Miranda House of Delhi University to pursue BSc in zoology. I couldn\u2019t concentrate there. I badly wanted to become a doctor. I decided to take a drop. I prepared well that year but my confidence level was too low. I took the exam in 2014 and my rank was around 20000s. I couldn\u2019t make it. I did not want to waste another year. I joined Sri Venkateswara College of DU for the same course. Again I couldn\u2019t concentrate but I decided to prepare simultaneously. I wrote the exam in 2015 and it was again a failure. I am fit for nothing. I am a loser. My life can never be good. All sorts of negative thoughts were lingering in my mind throughout my college life. It was a dull and a monotonous period. I pretended to be happy but there was something killing me deep inside. However, my interest towards the subject never decreased. By the third year I was slowly moving out of depression and started to focus more on my studies. 2017 I applied for MSc and Integrated Ph.D programs and wrote entrances for that. I secured AIR 14 in IIT JAM Biological Sciences.AIR 120 in IIT JAM Biotechnology.AIR 39 in JNU CEEBAIR 8 in AIIMS M.Biotech entrance examand 2 digit ranks in other small entrances. Are these my achievements? No. My real achievement is overcoming the fear to face a competitive examrising up after three drastic fallscoming out of four years of depressionrevitalizing my confidencetaking control over fear of failureacquiring the maturity to learn from failures rather than lamentingI do not know where I will stand in case I take up major competitive exams like UPSC but I now have the courage to face anything. I have the confidence that I can do it. I will not stagnate if I fail. I know how to maintain a stable mind whether it is a failure or success. ",

I am a sector Warden at Civil Defence, Ghaziabad.This year we got an information that this year civil defence will also be participating at the Republic Day Parade which is held at Reserved Police Lines, Ghaziabad. I was specifically advised by our divisional warden ,Rajender Sharma sir to participate in it. So,from 1st January,2020 our training began. Our instructor was Hawaldar Angrej Singh sir of 16th betalion,Punjab Regiment. He taught us how to parade property and out of 100 candidates who applied for he parade ,only 21 were selected on merit of whome I was also a part. Niranjan Yadav sir was selected as our platoon commander not on the basis of merit but just because of the fact that he is a senior and had joined civil defence much earlier than others. Nobody in the group was happy with his command and he was a bit old due to which he couldn't match with the platoon.  This is our group standing with Angrej Singh sir ( in the centre).  Then one day I asked my comrades that what if I'll ask Angrej sir that i want to become the platoon commander.All of than became blvery happy and excited and motivated me to approach him. I went to Angrej sir and said that\" sir I want to lead the platoon\u201d. He very politely said that would you be able to do it. And I said yes sir( confidently and determined) .he then said show me by giving command. Then I went on to give the command- Parade ,Bayein se tej chal, Bayein mud, etc. He was impressed by my command and asked me to command the platoon next morning,I did it next morning and he finalized me as platoon commander. Then I commanded my platoon in the parade ,I was able to shake hands with Ret.General Vijay Kumar Singh sir , the M.P. from Ghaziabad who was also the chief guest of the parade. This is the thing that I find the biggest achievement of my life so far ,I hope I would be able to achieve more things,bigger things in my life. Thank you! ",

I didn't do well in four years of my college life. I loved the subject but I didn't able to grasp it, the faculties recruited from Anna University will make you hate every interesting subject. I lost all hope an I stopped paying much attention to studying after 2nd year. I started to believe I have chosen a wrong field. I will be looked down upon by many of my friends. I was supposed to graduate in 2016 after my 4 yrs of btech. But I flunked in one of the subject because of which I graduated one year late in 2017. I started preparing for gate exam in 2017. People will laugh when I will say I m preparing for IIT . I cleared written test got rank 164 , I had got negative marking in only one question. Which helped me secure good rank. In aerospace as seats are less ,I didn't get seat in IIT directly I was called for interview in IIT Madras. The interview went good. I told my mom and dad I will get it. And then the result came I didn't get it. My parents were upset. So I went back to Chennai started preparing for gate 2019 again. And I got a text a text message in August written \u201c I want to talk to you about MS admission in aerospace engineering in IIT Madras. From HoD aerospace engineering department. \u201c I was shocked I cross checked the number on truecaller to see if I m not being pranked. I miss that called as my phone was on silent so I called back sir didn't answer I went to IIT directly to his office. And I told him to send me offer letter. Until then I won't believe and I decided not to inform my parents untill its not confirm. As last time they go upset after I gave them hope that I will get. Finally I informed my dad after 10 days that I have got offered from IIT Madras and I m quitting coaching and shifting to IIT Madras .He started crying and he was happy. So yes my biggest achievement was not to get in to IIT. My biggest achievement was to believe in myself when no One did. To know that I know myself better than others. I love this I wanted this. I don't care what people think of me. Thank you ",

            "answer_text": "I just couldn\u2019t cope with my learning disabilities, so I left school one morning for good at 14 yrs of age. I didn\u2019t know what to do with my life. As I walked down the road from my school that early morning, I turned a corner and the morning sunshine hit me in the face as an awakening. I realized then, I was fully on my own and I could no longer rely anybody but myself. I knocked on every door of every business asking if they needed help, all with much rejection. I finally, found a used car dealership over 10-miles from the school whom hired me. I was fortunate to get hired by these somewhat wayward playboys of the industry. It wasn\u2019t long before I\u2019m selling cars at 17-years of age and making great money. Buying new corvettes and living and enjoying the moment. My great accomplishment was that I went on to open my own used car dealership at 18-years of age. Unfortunately, I lost the car lot by the time I turned 19-years of age. I was deeply disappointed in myself. I spent the next 5-years of my life beating myself up over the opportunity lost. Although, staying in the industry, I found wonderful supportive people whom guided me and helped me reestablished myself, personally and professionally. (With that support and guidance, I went on to open many more successful dealerships) I learned much from this youthful failure which was all part of the process of growing up and which led to my achievements. Perseverance and resilience pays great dividends. ",

            "answer_text": "*ALWAYS PUSHING MYSELF BEYOND COMFORT ZONE* It is always easy to start pursuing an interest out of one\u2019s volition but difficult to pursue it as a continuing passion with a certain goal post in your mind and heart. Early in my childhood, my parents identified a spark in me for a sense of rhythm and tune. Thus I got exposed to learning hindustani classical vocal training in Guru-Shishya parampara initially at Dehradun and subsequently at Vadodara.  Dehradun is very typical for allergies which is predominant during season change & in winter months. Early in my training as a five year old, I experienced the symptoms of allergic conditions like stuffy nose, congestion which got more complex frequently and was diagnosed as an asthmatic condition. This threatened my self-belief to be able to pursue it in an organized and rigorous way. For a young learner like me a voice that could be free of such medical condition could only enhance the process of learning and appreciating the process. I soon felt it was not possible for me to be able to hit all the high notes while practicing with allergic condition which was not visible on the surface of it and I would end up practicing with a hoarse voice. Singing while hoarse meant you strain your vocal cords and risking setting back your recovery and making voice even worse. Amidst this medical condition and vocal chord changes due to adolescence, I persisted with the advice of my teacher and parents to continue learning and practising singing with self-moderation while opting for self-help, yoga and meditation. My Guru-teacher would start my practice that involved vocalizing on vowel sounds, chanting bija sounds both as a means to release negative energy of the medical condition and as an added benefit for developing voice culture and to bring voice back into balance. I continued my journeying for over 12 years until my 6th year of Prabhakar that clashed with my class 11th. It looked extremely difficult at first to manage school, coaching and riyaaz. However, I continued out of my own passion and joy to complete Prabhakar with distinction. As I retrospect, although initially daunting, daily stepping out of one\u2019s comfort zone was both cumbersome and elating. Overcoming anxieties and having to step out and persist with singing practice proved a career bonus for me with which I got identified in my school, college and in immediate society apart from providing a sense of joy which can be cherished.

            "answer_text": "In dreams i saw my past relations with my husband. It proved how being soul mates could help one another in the physical life. During my youth i thought i did not dream. I did not remember i dreamt in the many years i had been sleeping at night. However, there is only one dream i remembered. And i remembered it because repetitively dreamt of it. In the dream, i saw myself curled like a fetus. At the same time, another picture attached to the first part of the dream is also me standing at the center of a circle. The circle is lighted like the light shining on the moon. In the center of the space, i looked farther seeing vast space in grey. It took me some ten or twelve years before i was able to inderstand the meaning of my dream. It was, indeed, symbolical. When i was new in the secret organization where me and my husband are regular members and attendees, i dreamt that our Master Teacher told us all members to stand in one place together. In that spot, we were told to run following a white string placed on the side corner of the road. When our Esoteric Teacher told us to go, we all ran simultaneously. I ran fast like an arrow shot. I felt i was alone running so i looked back. When i looked back i saw our Teacher\u2019s wife far behind with the others running. But she ould not run faster because she was carrying a baby in her left arm, and holding a child\u2019s hand while running. The i continued running, i was alone, but felt someone is running beside me. He was our Teacher. He continued running with me showing where to go if there were blockades or barrier on the way. When i followed the direction he showed me i would run there, looking at the white string on the side. There was a rime when i was already alone running. I only followed the white string wherever it would go. If it goes to an area where i could step on mud and small rocks, i could follow it. If the string went up an adobe fence with uneven placement, i also climbed it up. When i was on the other side of the fence, i saw the highway, white with light. That time i was alone. Then i woke up. To this day i knew the meaning of that dream. Many of my dreams i was able to remember because after dreaming and i woke up, i write them all in my notebook. Perhaps because i do not remember my dreams i was instructed to write them. I had in my side on th ebed a notebook and a flashlight so that i could writemwhile i still remember them. Credits : wonderopolis  Also, there was once a time when i dreamt of fellow members in the secret group where me and husband are regular attendees. In the dream, i saw the girl and the male member singing the same love song together . I do not usually tell my dreams. When they happened, i found it connected with my dream. Later, the two got married ahead of me and my husband. Some of my dreams are literally meaning to describe certain individuals\u2019 characters or personality. When i had the chance to know them, i knew my dreams about them are real. ",

            "answer_text": "This is not my biggest achievement in life, but something I\u2019ve achieved recently and pretty proud of. I have always been a sprinter. In sports, work and live I preferred short-term goals to long-run strategy. Today for the first time I swam freestyle for 1500 meters (0.92 miles) without a stop. Probably with a shitty result. But still, this is a huge deal for me. When I just started, I could not swim more than 200 meters in a row. Building a company is the same. You start with short-term goals, like talking to potential customers, launching, validating the idea, making the first 10 sales. Later on, you have to plan for a quote, then a year. At some point, you start setting company direction to what you think the future would look like in 10 or 20 years. I\u2019m far from that at both work and sport. My next short-term goal is to swim 2 km.  ",

            "answer_text": "Rebuilding my life from scratch and surviving on my own after being kicked out of my parents\u2019 home for being a girl. I grew up in an orthodox Indian family, one which despises the thought of having daughters. My parents always believed that daughters are nothing but a burden and that if they had the opportunity, they would have gotten rid of me. I have a younger brother. From the day he was born, he was cared for like a royalty and I on the other hand was treated like dirt. Long story short, they would pick on me for everything I did. I was provided the bare minimum for survival and my brother lived luxuriously. I grew enduring constant physical and mental abuse for merely existing. I tolerated everything till one fine day I decided that i had enough of this ill treatment and just left when they pushed me out and locked the doors for something petty. Mind you, I was only a graduate fresh out of Uni looking for a job at that time. So, jobless and now homeless me managed to get temporary shelter at a friend\u2019s place and slowly started rebuilding my life. As luck would have it, I landed my first job within a month after that, saved up enough to get my own place and a car to get around. In no time at all, I was completely independent living a decent life. It has been 5 years now. That is by far the greatest achievement in my life. ",

Ironical,because I have never been a sportsperson;never ever.. It so happened that all the team members were alloted to different teams-green,white red and black and we only were to allot the captains for the respective teams.. It so happened that people came forward to lead in the front of all other three teams-black,red and white and the only team that was left was green..So the organizers kept asking us who would lead team green from the front and there was no response..This question was repeated for three times and the time was ticking..So since no one came forward i decided to take over the responsibility..the same me,who wasnt a sportsperon,the one who quit sports because of not being sportive decades ago.. So our chief guest,the company MD called me and handed over the team flag and my responsibility.. I participated in the relay and our team became runner ups there \u2026 While all others in my team were awesome and gave exemplary performance,I was in the background encouraging them more than anybody\u2026 God was also with me..Yes, after a lot events, we were declared the year's champions and I had the best moment when I lifted the cup..This gave me the confidence of a lifetime..

            "answer_text": "I grew up as the eldest child of a middle class family. Even if we could afford to avail certain small luxurious experiences of life, my family never indulged into them. We never dined out or went on holidays. Somehow, it felt that the people who go to expensive restaurants or five star hotels are a class above, primarily in terms of social status. When I started working, I had a successful career. I earned good money and whether on business or personal expenses, I regularly and sometime only stayed at the most expensive hotels or ate at the best restaurants in the town. Even after ten years of this lifestyle, I somehow felt like an outsider. I always had palpitations when I would check in at an upmarket property. I would feel nervous and even knowing that it is ridiculous to feel that way, I still continue to feel that way. There is a part of me which is still a continuation of my father and his complexes. Few years back, I was out with my younger siblings for a holiday. We were at in upmarket property and I couldn't help but notice how confident and comfortable they were in their surroundings. I must stress that my siblings do not avail these luxuries on a regular basis and almost always it is when I treat them or take them out. They do not feel entitled or behave in that manner. They are not attached to money or a certain lifestyle. But they have the inner confidence. They feel the same in that upmarket hotel as they feel at home or in their college hostel. I realised that the chain has broken. They do not carry the outsider burden that my father or uncle carried and one that I inherited. That is my biggest accomplishment or success in life. I regularly speak to them, encourage them, tell them about the stories of my work and travels and most importantly give them the confidence that they can achieve anything. That confidence shows and is my most satisfying success. ",

I had previous experience of leading teams within the setting of a hospital for people detained under the Mental Health Act.

The manager was not easy to work with, the staff team were sly and had an agenda against me and I was having home stress all at the same time. After six months of this I was a defeated man in every sense of the word. I even wanted to quit my ten year career in care work. I requested a de motion to Senior Support Worker at a home for high functioning adults and I was there for 18 months and this went very well. I leant a lot about residential services in this time. Another advert for Team Leader came up again and I went in for it and got the job. Now my role as Team Leader is very successful and I am even having a stint at Acting Manager. My greatest achievement is never giving up. ",

            "answer_text": "One of my most agonizing, most visceral fears was going from a full time employee to unemployed. I understood that many people dream of long vacations and not having to go to work but it was my nightmare. I hardly ever took time off. Without work, what would I do all day? Without the bustle of my job, who would I be? The notion of completely empty days with nothing to fill them petrified me. This terror kept me shackled to a way of life that made me feel both safe and suffocated. Is \"safe\" worth it if it traps you? One day I decided it was time to turn decades of a very structured life on its head. It was time to follow my own advice and do what I was most afraid of. I quit my job and, well. I don't know how else to put this: I adapted instantly. To my utter shock, I have a natural inclination towards loitering. I loaf. I lounge. I linger. I dawdle. I know. This does not sound particularly dashing. My admission does not exactly portray a hero's journey. Still, I consider this my greatest success and as such challenge the notion that to succeed I have to suffer. ",

This is about the time when I gave my first motivational lecture to class 11th in a school. Till that moment I had never even thought about becoming a motivational speaker. I was just free at that time and I thought ` Why not share my experiences with some students. Why not discuss some do\u2019s and don\u2019ts about the student life.\u2019 Now coming to the moment when I was giving my first seminar. Everything went well from the start till the end, but something happened in the end which changed my life. After I said ` Thank You `, I got a standing ovation from all the 350 students who were sitting in that auditorium. That was the first moment in my life which actually felt like a dream. That was the moment in which for the first time I felt that ` what I did was actually useful to someone else`. For the first time in my life I told myself that what I just did right now was definitely ` worth it`. From that day I knew what I wanted to do in my life and from that day I actually have a aim to follow and lots of students to motivate. Hope you like it. Stay Awesome, Stay Amazing. ",

            "answer_text": "I've always wanted to be a singer. Recently, there was a school concert (considering the fact that I am still in school) and I was asked to sing. My music teacher is amazing and supported the idea so I decided I would try find a song and learn it in time for the the concert. When I couldn't decide, a friend of mine offered to play under me and sing with me (unfortunately she didn't sing but I wish she did) and we practised. It was so new to me and I've honestly never felt happier. The day of the concert, it turned out I was singing off-key, which is a problem I have, but I pushed through with singing All of Me. I know I still had to improve because I was singing off-key during the performance but even then, many people and friends had told me it was amazing. Turns out that no one had noticed I was singing off-key slightly but I still think I can improve. I'm proud because on the day, the idea became so much more daunting than it originally was to me. I was scared of making a fool of myself but in the end I got to many nice comments that I was never used to getting before. I hope that I can do it again but do much better with a song that I'm familiar with. Thanks for reading. Peace- Xx ",

He said I am asking about valuable stuff like material things, money, business or job and things like that. I replied \"Yes, I told you the most valuable things I have achieved in life. Along with that, I have long list things including those you mentioned but I am telling you the most valuable things in life. Unless you achieved what's most valuable.. rest everything isn't enough.\" You don't have to always identify yourself with your job or designation or with the money you have made or the things you have acquired. They are definitely an integral part of life and sooner or later you will have them all. However, if you are not achieving the most valuable things in life which are always intangible then none of the things that you achieved is going to give you fulfilling life. Thank You for reading.

I was in a nun\u2019s school which was quite strict. Heaven and hell and punishment played a big role in our education. I grew up with fears, inhibitions and low self-esteem. I had to rebuild myself, bit by bit, and I suffered greatly. I had become my own psychologist. Today I feel at peace. I have made peace with my past. I do not judge myself anymore. I am not harsh with myself anymore, and most importantly I love people and life. Life is beautiful if we decide that we want to see its beauty not its torments. This, I would say, is my biggest achievement. ",

            "answer_text": "I wish I had a great happy achievement to share. I guess in the end it is. I was a heroin addict for 15 years. It consumed me. I worked to afford my habit as a stripper and did my drugs to be able to do my job. Heroin was my life. I was so physically and mentally addicted to it that even the thought of quitting was terrifying. Yet I wanted so badly to be free of my slavery to that drug. I tried a few times unsuccessfully to quit throughout the years and it only left me more certain that I was forever stuck. Eventually my live in boyfriend and partner in crime was arrested and put in jail. I was alone, scared and lonely, with a major addiction to feed. After going on, for some time, I decided to try quitting again. This time I called my mother for support. This time I didn\u2019t have the outside influence of my boyfriend to draw me back into using. This time my body was tired of needing a substance in order to function. With a lot of support and some medication and counseling I was able to kick my heroin addiction. I still see my counselor every two weeks and I\u2019m addressing mental illnesses left over from the years of drug use, like depression, PTSD, and anxiety among other issues, but I\u2019m free. I\u2019ve been clean for over 10 years now and I still find it hard to believe that I actually made it through that battle! So while I wish I had a story of winning the Olympics or making the Menza organization, I am very proud of this achievement and it is certainly the biggest one I\u2019ve made in my life. ",

            "answer_text": "I was born in a govt. hospital, because my parents couldn't afford a private hospital. the condition of the hospital in those days were pathetic(believe me it's way better these days). When I turned 3 I was admitted to an English medium private school since my parents wanted to give the best of the education to their child, but to pay the fee they had to stop even the basic necessities as basic as milk. So next year they got me admitted to govt. school where I studied till 12th. Fast forward to 2020 here's a pic of me traveling business class bought my hard-earned money.  Although it happened only once, but the moment I booked this ticket all of my family's past flashed in my mind. All the struggle we did to save every penny we could, thinking twice even before spending a small amount. I silently cried while sitting alone and feeling of pride came from within, who knew a 5-year-old boy didn't speak a word standing in a shopping mall looking at his favorite toy because he knew his father will buy that for him and might have to sleep hungry next day will fly business class one day. It may be a very small thing for a lot of people these days, but for me it is huge. So my biggest achievement of life to help my family to gain basic financial stability in life.

Once i completed my degree,i got a job(not what i expected,but i had to pursue that job).It was teaching school children basic electronics in the name of robotics.. I was alloted to a school far away from my native..in kerala Tamilnadu border..where most of the students spoke malayalam which i was totally unaware of.I was nervous all time since i hadn\u2019t underwent any sort of training like how to handle students and all..I myself was a fresher who had just stepped out of the classrooms..i had to handle so many children with theory as well as practical classes. It was very difficult for me to handle children starting from class 3 to 9th.But I tried my best to be a better guide to them.More than a teacher,I tried to be friendly and feedback accepting type which i wished from my teachers during my schooling. Then came that day,a month before teacher\u2019s day,all the teachers were presented with a saree in the school assembly at the front stage.For every other teachers, when their names were announced,their respective class children made cheers with claps..But since I was just 2 months to that school,never expected that happened next. When my name was announced,I came to the stage to receive the present from the principal,The loud cheers broke the silence that prevailed the last minute\u2026I was astonished..wondered some other chief guest was arriving suddenly onto the stage. To my shock,I turned back and found no one. I was literally frozen and was physically shivering.I was knocked down with that gesture.The next few minutes,the claps sound didn\u2019t faint.That\u2019s when I realised the love from the children towards me. When I went behind the stage after receiving the saree,the other teachers reacted with a smile.One of them,whispered \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d. I was on cloud nine. That day onwards i became more responsible towards the children.I learnt that every single actions from their favourite teacher they keenly noted and kept following.I was careful with things I did before them. Even 2 or 3 years have passed,after i left that job..Still this moment stirs my heart with pleasure.That was an achievement that i never expected as of to me. Thanks for reading..sorry for that looong answer ;D Au revoir\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "I was working as a social worker for the Institute of Disability Studies at the University of Southern Mississippi. I assisted Vietnam Veterans who were exposed to agent orange and as a result of their exposure\u2026had children who were physically or mentally handicapped as a result of their father\u2019s exposure. One night my wife asked me to drive her about 11 miles from our home to a meeting being held at a small cafe in town. A group of people were trying to raise money to open up a shelter home for children who had been abused or neglected and taken into State custody. She hated driving at night on the narrow two lane road. I sat in the corner and listened to the people talk about how hard it was to raise the funds needed. Something made me speak up and ask\u2026\u201dWhy don\u2019t someone look into government and private grants to help?\u201d The chair looked at me\u2026asked my name\u2026and said. \u201cMr Latham, we would be pleased to have you do so. I am sure you wouldn\u2019t mind doing that to help children who have been abused in mind and body and spirit.\u201d How could I say \u201cno\u201d to that? Over the next few weeks, I researched and looked for grants via the University\u2019s library\u2026.and four about six that I thought might be good to try for. I took the info to the Chair of the organization\u2026and thought that was the end. It wasn\u2019t. She looked me in the eye and said, \u201cNone of us have ever written a grant before. Could you write the applications for us?\u201d I stuttered\u2026\u201dI guess so.\u201d and off I went. Two weeks later I handed them in to her to clean up and submit\u2026.and walked away. Two months later\u2026the chair and two members of the board walked into my office with a bottle of champagne. The very first grant I had penned, for $158,000, had been approved. It was enough to get started and run for one year. Then, they asked if I would become the Director of the non profit\u2026it required someone with a degree and a social work license. I ended up accepting the position and Hope Haven \u2026now Hope Haven Child Advocacy Center, Waveland Ms. has been opened for 25 years and has served thousands of children and families in need. It was\u2026and is\u2026the best thing I have ever done. I retired in 2015 and I look back and\u2026am so glad my wife didn\u2019t like to drive at night. ",

We used to be a huge joint family and my father started working from the age of 10 (My Grandfather owned a business and my dad helps him after his School). Most of the riches my Grandfather and uncles enjoyed was the hard earned money of my dad and one fine day my grandfather disrespected my dad and asked \u201cWhat has he done for the family?\u201d and my dad left the home and we became a Nuclear family when I was 12 years old. From then he was working hard to keep the family running and he is the bread winner of the family since then. Recently, we successfully finished our Sister\u2019s marriage and I shared a huge financial burden of my dad and I was on my toes till the marriage was over. What\u2019s so great in this? You may ask? As you all know marriages in India are the moments of Pride and let\u2019s not be judgemental here and every other relatives of ours praised for conducting such a great marriage function and my Father proudly told everyone that Without my Son I wouldn\u2019t have been done this. Isn\u2019t that a great thing? As a Son I am really happy that I could make my parents happy and brought him Pride and made the relatives who looked down upon us? This is the great accomplishment according to me. Cheers.. :) ",

At the end of the lunch, buses were waiting on 50th Street at the base of 30 Rock Center to take them on tours of the city. Rudy Giuliani's 1st wife, Donna Hanover was a keynote since she was a tv personality and after the lunch I was escorting her and a few camera crews to the rooftop to shoot an interview.  As I got on the elevator with Donna (and hundreds of journalists headed down), a panicked staffer rushed up and whispered \"there aren't any buses downstairs!\"  Seemingly cool and collected, I brought the folks up to the roof, got them situated and excused myself.  While I liquified inside, I de-elevated 70 floors to the street where, voila!  15 buses filled with journalists were idling on the street awaiting my command.  Like Natalie Wood in Rebel Without a Cause, I stood in the middle of 50th Street between 5th and 6th Avenues, raised me arms above my head and plunged them down... and the buses pulled out and thundered past into the 5 boroughs.  From career nadir to triumph in 70 floors! ",

Too Easy, a novel published by Simon & Schuster, was hailed by Kinky Friedman as \"the unwed mother of all page turners\u201d; it was translated into French, German, and Dutch\u2026.Here's my most unusual achievement: Theoryland, an 8-page poem that is smart, tells a story, and is fun to read. But the literary world is vast so there are many, many thousands who have done exceptional things. Completely unexpectedly, if I try to think of something unique, I have to mention my work in education. After 10+ years of writing lots of articles, I reached the position of maintaining that there are no good ideas left in the public schools. I explain why our Education Establishment got rid of the traditional, superior ideas. I explain the flaws in the bogus new stuff. Apparently, the brains at Harvard\u2019s Graduate School of Education cannot explain the flaws, otherwise why would they endorse so many destructive ideas? Why would they use sight-words instead of phonics? Why would they push Reform Math instead of traditional arithmetic? Why would they use Constructivism instead Direct Instruction? I have to be careful not to be too cute here. I assume they know exactly the same things that I know but they PRETEND not to. Okay, that would seem to leave me as the solitary expert. That's an achievement however I got there. CODA: I have long said that the biggest problem in American education is low literacy. I've also said that it's the easiest problem to fix. Many readers have trouble with this aggressive position. Maybe the tide is turning. October last year, the New York Times ran a long piece saying we had a big problem because we were using the wrong methods. Thank you, New York Times. It took 60 years but you finally got there.  ",

Thanks to doing a first aid course I knew what to do. - Raised $180 for children in poverty. - Started a depression support group on http://bebo.com which lots have benefitted from. - Helped my mother out of an abusive relationship (was only 14 at the time). - Became a member of WSPA and donate money regularly. Although, i'd have to say that one of my best accomplishments was asking for help when I needed it most. If I didn't, I wouldn't have been here to do all of those other great things. I've never shared what I've done with the media - all I need is personal satisfaction that i've done something positive. Besides, it's the little things that everyone does that count the most - it all adds up. ",

This is something that set me free from searching and that I will always be forever grateful for. I \u201cachieved\u201d something that I would never lose again, or anyone could take away from me. Something that would never change but was constant and real. I was raised Catholic and always had this hunger inside of me to know God. When the church could not answer my questions, I turned away from the church and embarked on my own journey. I searched for about 18 years. I was abscessed with the idea that there was a Truth that unraveled all the questions mankind could ever have in regards to who we are and why are we here. I searched through many books\u2026not finding. I did not know what the Truth was\u2026but I knew what it was not\u2026so I kept seeking. I had many mystical experiences growing up, but when in 2000 my brother died.. I went into meditation for the first time. I always feared meditating up to that point, since I was able to communicate with those that passed over, but I missed my brother so much that I was willing to overcome my fear and try to connect with him. Not only did I connect with him, but I connected with God. I was guided to meditate every evening and I learned of spiritual things, first only during meditation and then also during everyday activities. Instead of meditating I would spend most of my time in contemplation and communication with God directly until one evening I went to bed with a feeling of a question \u2026but no question formulated in my mind. The next morning I woke up in complete bliss and I realized that I was this bliss. ",

If you were to ask me what my dream or biggest wish was, my first reply would be to get a dog. Finally it happened. I turned to see my Aunt holding a precious dog swandled in blankets. I teared up and almost tackled my mom in a hug. It really was a dream come true. All the Christmas lists, prayers, and hints have finally payed off. All the times showing her how responsible I am, or how dedicated I could be have finally payed off, and I don't remember a time where I was happier. Experiencing your biggest dream coming true is usdescribable. You feel like it's a dream, surreal, and magical. You never want the moment to end in fear that it'll never come back. I'm so lucky to have experience my dream coming true, and I hope every person in the world could feel the joy I feel right now at least once in their life. ",

Third, I've taught and otherwise accompanied many people in the learning process via both technical and religious educational efforts.

            "answer_text": "\u201cEvery achievement looked BIG until I achieved it.\u201d In my journey of life, definition of achievement changes from one phase to other. Whenever I achieve something and think about it after some months or years, I literally feel, it\u2019s just nothing, even though, I am desperate and struggled a lot in the journey of achieving it. In India, for Engineering undergraduates, who come from a middle class family background, getting placed in a product based company is just a dream even today. So, let me tell my 22 years life story: Year 1997: After struggling for 9 months inside my mothers womb, I came out into this beautiful world and it took some time for doctors to make me to cry. Achieved: LIFE. Years 1999 - 2002: My health got deteriorated frequently. Got infected by different kinds of diseases like Cholera, Typhoid, Diarrhea and finally effected by severe Chicken Pox.Even Some of our relatives thought, I may die and believed that giving treatment is waste of money. But neither my mom nor my dad lost hope and that little body healed back quickly, miraculously.Achieved: HEALTH. Years 2003 - 2005: The person whom I love the most, my mother, got effected with sudden and a severe nerve damage in brain. It took her a year and half to completely heal and gain back health.Middle class family, dad need to work, I am around 8 years, my sister is still a baby. Thinking about my incapability to help dad and seeing the pain my mother went through, I don\u2019t know how many times I cried hiding myself.I am not sure whether it can be called depression or not (I was a kid, don\u2019t even understand what it is). But, thank god, I came out of it quickly.Achieved: RELIEF. Years 2006 - 2012: Primary School life: Luckily got admission into Kendriya Vidyalaya ( A school, funded by Central Government of India), children whose parents serve for nation study in this school. Hence, studying in K.V is really a privilege.Studying here, develops an individual both personally and emotionally. Also, since we grow between students from different cultures, our maturity levels increase.Here, comes the problem, for a student who doesn\u2019t know Hindi, it\u2019s little tough to mingle with, but one can manage by speaking English. Local language is spoken very less and it took me 3\u20134 years to properly understand and speak Hindi. But, never once I failed to get good marks.Here, we doesn\u2019t get spoonfeeded with important questions. One need to prepare independently for exams. Learnt to be independent and consistent and passed with 9.4 CGPA (Now, it doesn\u2019t even matter but at that time, achieving a 9 or 10 pointer is great)Achieved: CONSISTENCY. Years 2012 - 2018 I didn\u2019t enjoy my high school life because I forget to live life like a human. I fell into rat race to get into IITs, NITs and other prestigious colleges. The lifestyle is same as a robot.Experienced my first failure in my life as I failed to get admission to prestigious colleges of the country and ended in a local college.I took my Engineering challenging, even ended up with a backlog in 1st year, never felt lost, rolled up my sleeves, cleared it next year, understood algorithms, strengthen my coding skills, passed with an 8 pointer, to be precise 8.5 GPA.Mu Sigma: REJECTED, Amazon: REJECTED, Infosys: REJECTED..\u2026. similarly got rejected by around 21 companies, mocked by classmates, teachers and relatives, but never lost hope, became more determined and finally got placed in Worlds No.1 CRM Company.Achieved: My DREAM. (5 years back) Currently: In process of buying a house for my parents!!There are many other things which I have achieved in my life, which made me as well as my parents happy. Once, I look back at the things I achieved, they all look very small when compared to my next goal and this cycle continues. Let me repeat my statement again: \u201cEvery achievement looked BIG until I achieved it.\u201d I wish to write more, but will stop it here!! Khudhafeez \ud83d\udc4b ",

Now, my mission is to convert states into countries. :P I've changed myself into a calm and sensible person. I\u2019ve successfully saved my childish and weird behaviours. I look simple but never judge a book by its cover. :D Now, I believe in that happiness is in what you like, what you love and what you want to do in life, not money. I keep myself away from herd race now. On Quora, I've earned new friends, motivators and criticizers. And I love all of them. I am poor in English language but still I\u2019ve achieved 1000+ friends. I've developed that confidence which inspires me to write what I feel without thinking about my poor skills. I am an introvert and it's a big achievement that I write long answers here and I can express my feelings better now. So, betterment in personality is a big achievement for me. :) ",

            "answer_text": "I feel very sorry for my inability to answer your question directly due to the following reason : In my opinion, the state of achievement is the perceived end result of our Expectations. If we learn to live without expectations of our actions, we would never land into the state of regret or proudness. The thought of achievement is born out of the nature of result which in turn evolves from our expectations. In other words, if there is no expectation then obviously there is no thought about achievement. Why I am living without any expectations? We are capable only to initiate an action. The initiated action brings the result only after passing several constraints of external parameters such as environmental, social , hierarchical, incidental etc. Since the expected result is directly proportional to our initiation (I), our follow-up or hard-work (FH), the external parameters (E) (that are absolutely beyond our control), there are lot of possibilities for the Actual result to match the Expected result. Result (R) = I x FH x E (where E is not absolutely in our control) Imagine a status, where our initiative is fantastic (so I gets 1) and our follow-up or hard-work is splendid (so FH is also 1) and unfortunately if one of the aforesaid external parameters hasn\u2019t supported our action, then E becomes 0. This way, the value of Result would be 0 (zero). So we end up getting \u20180\u2019 actual result against the expected result of \u20181\u2019. When Expected result doesn\u2019t match the Actual result, we will get into the state of Regret and I don\u2019t want to fall into this state very often. So I don\u2019t know what I have achieved. But I know what I performed. ",

I think all parents wish for their children to achieve more, be more than they are - and that was my wish. I grew up with low self-esteem and lofty goals , but low achievement. When my three daughters were born I honestly thought they were a clean slate where I influenced their final picture. Although I worked outside of the home, I devoted myself to my children and their success. Now, to me, success does not necessarily mean more education and more money, but rather they find happiness and satisfaction with their lives. Proudly I am the mother of a graphic designer,turned teacher. Another daughter is a doctor who has won the praise and acclaim of her peers in the medical community, the third moved to a foreign country to marry and is now a teacher. All are married, happy and, by all accounts, successful. They call me regularly, not out of obligation, but because we love \u201ccatching up\u201d. Lucky me! ",

            "answer_text": "I am 20 years old. And till now according to Me the achievement which I am going to share with you is the biggest achievement. So here I begins........ The time when I was in class 10th, there held an inter school declamation contest in the school at the next city. And the principal of our school wants her students to participate in it. That's why 9th and 10th class was informed about the competition and were given the topics to prepare. The two students were going to be selected for the competition out of which my classmate named X was already selected as she was participating since 4 years and brought prizes for the school. So now it was the time for the selection of second one. There were approximately 20 students in line for the selection. The principal mam and our English teacher who was given the duty to prepare us filtered the three(including Me )out of 20. We were given two topics - 1.women empowerment and 2. Money a modern addiction. The first topic was given to X who was already selected and the second one was given to us three. Three of us practised for three four days and finally the time came of selecting one out of us. We three ( me, y, z) delivered the speech in front of our principal mam, vice principal mam and our English teacher. Out of us Z was rejected and then again it was tough to select out of me and y. And unfortunately everyone there liked y. She was very well than me but ohhhh my Fortune , even though she was good but I was selected due to my cuteness. ( not lying actually I was selected only and only due to my cuteness ) Principal mam said that I was so cute that judges would be automatically impressed . And at the end I was selected. Huhhh finally covered the selection. Now there was the time of practice. X and me we both practice daily and deliver in front of our sir. He was very happy to listen X but not me and the reason he pointed out was my same tone ( that is, sorrow tone) in whole speech. Everytime when I gave the speech he got disappointed. I was also so worried because I wanted that I should be selected because of my ability. The class 9th and 10th everyone were knowing about the reason of my selection and all of them were blaming the teachers and principal for being partial in my case. One afternoon X and I were practicing our speech under supervision of our sir in the playground as usual. He listened us both but again got disappointed from me and he turned angry. He asked me to speak a line from the speech of X and the line was - women are raped, kicked, killed\u2026.. which X speaks rapidly in anger tone. I copied her and spoke up the same but Sir pointed me out that I had copied her if that would be the line of my speech I would speak slowly showing the sorrow. And by saying this he left us ,we went home. It takes one hour to reach home and that one hour I was just thinking about that line and sir's wording and there I realized that what do sir mean by tone and since so many days I was taking tone as pitch and was improving daily in my pitch. I reached home locked my room and cried bitterly for one hour. And then I promised myself to improve. I stood up in front of the mirror and practiced so hard till I reached school next morning. Once again now it was time to deliver in front of principal mam and sir. Sir called us both , went to the office. First it was the turn of X and next me. I started my speech....complete silence in the office, everyone were listening me silently. I ended my speech and what I see is that principal mam giving standing ovation and clapping for me..... ohhhhhhh my god then I got relief. They praised me a lot. They were shocked of my transformation. And I was so happy. Then, sir got an idea. He called Yand Z again and kept a competition between us three and the judges appointed for this task were some (approx 7-8)of the brilliant students of class 10th. Everyone had to give us marks out of 40. And the winner would be the student having highest total. And offcourse the winner was me now. Sir played this game only to get rid of the blame of partiality. Finally the tension was over and now X and me were focussed for the inter school competition. The competition was to be held for two days - trial and final . There were 28 schools participating in the trial - two students from each school, in total 56 students out of which 5 schools that is 10 students were to be selected for the final round. So finally after three to four days the trial round had come. X and me went there, along with the sir ,delivered the speech at our turns and were waiting for the result. Huhhh now the result time, tension everywhere, complete silence, fingers crossed. The host announced the position 5th\u2026\u2026.. 4th\u2026\u2026\u2026, 3rd\u2026\u2026\u2026.2nd \u2026\u2026\u2026..and then the first goes to our school means us.... Yeahhhhhhhhhhh sooooo happy all three of us. We both got the participation prize and the certificate.  After four days was the final round.... Once again we went there along with sir, delivered the speech at our turns and waiting for the result. Now the game was among 10 students out of which 5 individual prizes were to be given. And till now it was believed by everyone (including me) that X is better than me and she will definitely get the prize. Results going to be announced, complete silence, fingers crossed,... The host announced the position 5th and that goes to X...... Ohhhhhhhhh noone was happy from us. Complete sadness on our face.  Because we were of the thought that if X stood 5th then I would definitely not get any of the position . Sir, me and X all three losed the hope. X went up the stage for the trophy. Thereby, host announces position 4th, 3rd, 2nd and then the first that belongs to meeeeeeeeeeeeee......... sir and me jumped with joy and said yesssssss we have done it.... And then I went up the stage for the trophy, called our honourable sir up , had a photograph and happily went back homes. Next day, the both positions were announced in the morning assembly , got a lot of congratulations from everyone we met and achieved all the happiness...... Sooooooooo this was my biggest ever achievement.   ",

Not all my friends were able to score (not boasting), but I did. I guess my first accomplishment. My second accomplishment was when I received a 5000 rupees cheque for my class 10th result. (kv policy). Yes, I know it was just for class 10th which I already achieved, but I believe this was the first salary I would say, which I earned with my knowledge. 12th was average!!!! Then, I wanted to do engineering (conventional, I know) but no one was there to show me a way. My parents, are advocates, they couldn't help me. But they did whatever they were able to do. Finally I cracked the west Bengal entrance examination. And now I am doing engineering. Third accomplishment. Owning my own laptop is my fourth accomplishment. Able to travel alone and making mom and dad\u2019s strain less is my fifth achievement. The list goes on. As the saying goes \u201cboond boond se dariya Banta hain\u201d (drop drop river becomes). Waiting for that one big river, which these drops of my little accomplishments will build and that day will sail the boat with my beloved family, on that river to experience the ultimate Accomplishment. These little things don't sound big, but believe me they feel big. Thank you. P. S. Let me know if I wrote the English proverb wrong. Because I don't remember it properly. ",

It was heart-warming how he giggled like a young child everytime he touched the screen and it responded. For him, this was magic. We struggled, but he was smart. He had a notebook in which he would jot down notes and he even studied before each session. A few weeks later he video-called his son using Skype and his eyes watered up. So did his son's.

I am a computer science student and my main reason to take up computer science is that i can really make some software products which can cause impact on the daily of life of people. During my summer vacations i was part of a really amazing set of people at National Innovation Foundation, Being a computer science student i took up a project which consisted of building an Android application for the local farmers so they can communicate with scientists regarding pest and other agricultural issues. I understand this is no fancy breathtaking application but i was really happy with the fact some farmers were using the application on daily basis. The moment my team went to demonstrate the application to the farmers. The farmers were so happy to see someone working on something to make their life easier. They insisted us to come inside have a drink to relieve us from the summer heat. Something which really moved me was the house i visited had one table fan for a family of 6\u20137 members as soon as one member in my team started to demonstrate how to use the application they came forward moved the fan from one room to to place it near my team member so that he can explain with comfort. Finally, the smile the farmers had, gaining trust of the farmers and winning their love was my biggest achievement till date. It was in the papers too!!  A picture with the masters!  ",

Later from missionary school I\u2019ve shifted to one of the commercial school where we had to study..study and study \u2026 But fortunately due to governments pressure on schools for having a sports hour like other normal daily classes even our so called school used to organise sports period. And then we successfully had many competitions in our school. Here comes the story, back in 2010 there was a sports meet in our school (inter school competition) where nearly 17 branches of same schools have participated in it. I went through the selections and was selected. Later the happiest moment is where I was made as \u2018Capitan\u2019 of the team though we had many seniors in our team..And then continuously I won many tournaments back to back in 7th,8th,9th&10th standards and I even got a title from my school as \u2018LITTLE TIGER\u2019 It is the biggest achievement of my life :)  These are few trophies which I won..:) ",

I cut that giant tree in half as well to further let the water flow. It took a very very long time but now the water flows a lot cleaner, the fish are able to move up and down stream easily again and there are less chances of beaver damming it back up.  The next picture was a project I actually just completed yesterday. The entire tree was taken out through a very hard process. Me my one friend and my father all went down, as my father is the head of public works for the town we live in which this lake and stream is located. The hardest part was getting the big parts of the tree cut. We cut it into many sections and at one part me and my friend had to life one of the entire branches up, which was at least 300 pounds probably more, and hold it while my father cut it apart. Then was put it all on the bank and ripped out the tinier sticks and branches stuck underwater. This was an even harder task because of the size of the tree that we needed to take out. I didn't take an after picture yet, which I'm doing later today, because my hands were soaking wet and I didn't want to ruin my phone. But as you can see from this picture above the downed tree collects piles of trash which then pollute the water in the area greatly, leaving a green slime. The reason I do this is because it's what I love to do. I hope to have something like this become my career as I'm currently studying to become an environmental scientist/technician  Here was the final result. Took this picture yesterday ",

I guess that's it, that's where the human capacity to measure achievements ends. Or I can as well brag about how much I earn working in a MNC. FULL STOP. MY USELESS ACHIEVEMENTS ENDS. NOW COMING TO THE MAIN STORY So it was 14th August, around 1 am and I was on my bed, thinking of ways I can anyway be of help to our army men. I thought of many things and then I read somewhere about 'BharatKeVeer' portal by Government of India where you can directly contribute to a martyr's account or you can donate to a common corpus. So I instantly made some donations through that portal. Then I came up with an idea, why not tell everyone in my company that such a portal exists and urge the employees to contribute as well. My company has around 9.5k employees and if only 3k of them contribute 500 RS each, the contribution would be 15 L. Because deep down we(most of us, barring ungrateful pigs) want to anyhow help our soldiers but we just keep on procrastinating/ forgetting it. Or maybe because sharing a photo of army on certain dates is an easier way of showing gratification than other stuffs. So I wanted to spread the word, but HOW? How can I reach to every employee? I thought of using the \u2018Internal Communications' mail mechanism. But using the Internal Communication forum for my own idea required many approvals and other stuff and I had just one day to do all this, ie just 14th because 15th would have been a holiday. It would not have been possible without a master key. Guess what I did? I directly wrote on that night to the CEO/MD of my company, Sandeep Kishore, describing the vision and asking for supreme permission. And then I slept. The next morning I woke up, the CEO had forwarded that message to Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Human Resource Officer, Chief Financial Officer asking them to aid me to fulfil this task. That day, I met all of them and shared a draft to be circulated to the employees. And by 6 pm, the mail was sent to everyone. On that circulation mail, the distributing team made a call themselves to include that I took this initiative. Within minutes of reaching the mail to employees, I started getting mails from the donators that they have contributed and would also tell others in their fraternity to do so. They thanked me for bringing to their notice that portals like that exist. For the first time in my life, I felt I achieved something. That day I came to understand what real achievements look and feel like. And yes, attaching a screenshot of that mail and urging you guys if you could also implement this in your organization and spread the word. I guess its an initiative which needs a little bit of determination from your end for persons who are ready to ready to lay down their lives for you, ANYTIME. I guess that's it. Pardon my grammar, language and other mistakes. Kinda new fellow on Quora. Jai Hind.  ",

Well it might be me getting into a prestigious college after flunking my 12th grade in the 1st attempt, which made my parents little proud. probably when I came first in a swimming race or when I weigh lifted dumble of 30 Kgs while still being skinny or maybe when over 14K people watched a meme video I made. or maybe when I had an average likes of 100\u2013150 on every meme I posted but probably my biggest achievement is that I learnt to Ignore or endure criticism & judgments. A lot of my peers and people of my age get easily offended if someone criticizes their work or actions. They react angrily to judgmental statements from others or assumptions. People of my age surely have an inferior complex & poor self esteem. I\u2019ve experienced a lot of mockery, taunting, criticism & prejudices yet 2 years into college & I have successfully learnt to ignore these. I\u2019ve learnt to endure it & focus on work that I was meant to do. I don\u2019t react to it unless it hurts me physically or affects me in studies or family relations. While a lot of people react angrily to a simple statement by others. I don\u2019t respond to those who mock me or try to troll me. Thankfully being a memer I somehow have learnt to have better comebacks. A lot of roast sessions take place in my peer group yet I am the last one to fall out. Just 2.5 years ago I was on the brink of committing suicide because I flunked 12th Grade, some people mocked me or taunted me. 5 Years back I was visibly damaged because a girl who was surely way out of league rejected my proposal. Looking back at these small things made me realise how easily I could have fell down, how easily small things affects us so much. We all should learn from our past experiences. We all should learn to ignore or endure criticism, assumptions, mockery, tauntings & judgments. Even If it\u2019s hate speech, someone commenting about our weight, shape, height, eyesight, marks, salary, relationship or even religion & political associations ",

Here goes the achievement  The arrow head is pointing at me. I ranked 5th in whole West Bengal Boards class 10 examination 2011. The Lady is our Honourable Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. She invited us to the Writer's Building of West Bengal. On the felicitation day, I reached the State Secretariat on time and went straight to the conference room through a VIP entrance with my Father and Uncle. Our CM came to the conference hall a few minutes later. She felicitated everyone, she heard patiently what each one of us wanted to say and if we were having any problems. High ranked Bureaucrats of Dept of Education were also their. At the end she gifted us a laptop and copy of hand written manuscript of Gitanjali by Rabindranath Tagore. There were News Channels photographers everywhere. When we came outside the hall there were atlest 100 camera flashes at a time and everything was happening so fast and randomly I was really puzzled.  This achievement is really special for me because I made my parents very proud. The above arrowhead in the picture is my father standing with pride beside the Chief Minister of West Bengal. That was a hell lot of experience and memory for a 15 yr small town boy like me then. Thanks for reading \u2764\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "Long ago, a boy was born in a small town in India. His father was a doctor and he was also expected to be intelligent like his father. In his early years, his parents noticed that he was slow in learning things compared to other children around. He started walking at the age of 2.5 years, rarely spoke anything because he was very shy and always liked to be where he is i.e. he was not active in anything. His parents thought that he would grasp things slowly in school too and to give him sufficient time to learn things, they admitted him to school at an early age of around 3.5 years. Things went on as expected. He was slow to learn the alphabet and scored badly in the kindergarten. He was just able to pass. He could not make many friends and most of the students from his class considered him as a loser. His performance improved a bit in grade 1 and 2 but not much and things went on in the similar fashion till some time. However, suddenly his life took a big turn. His father got transferred to a city in the mid of the academic year when he was in grade 5 and he had to change the school in the mid of the session. With the average scores the child had got in the previous years, it was very difficult to find a school in which he could get admission. But in a few days he got admitted in one of the new schools of the city.  With the new school, new problems arose. The new school had a rule according to which the students had to talk only in english, with teachers as well as friends. The boy had never talked in english with anyone ever in his life, though he had taken english as a subject in his earlier school. Along with that the boy had half yearly examinations going around in his school and he had an exam on the first day itself. The boy appeared in all the exams on that day as well as those in the coming days without any preparation. After a fortnight when the results were out, he was sure that for the first time in his life he would have failed in all the subjects. But to his and his teacher's surprise, he had scored 64 percent in the exams (which was decent for someone who had not attended any of the classes) and had failed only in the subject whose exam was on his first day in the school. This changed his life completely. The boy who was never appreciated for anything in his life, was honored on the stage by his class teacher in front of his classmates for his performance. While in his earlier school his classmates called him a loser because he did not talk with many people, in his new school he was awarded as the \"Most Disciplined Child\". People change the way they evaluate your deeds as soon as you become a star. Class toppers started picturing him as their enemy, who was soon going to take their position. All such proceedings boosted the self confidence of the boy and he decided that he will raise the bar. After constant hard work throughout the next 5 months, he was rewarded. He stood 3rd in the annual exams and 5th in the school.  But he realized that he was still not the best scorer and so he did not continue to work hard in future. But his destiny was somewhere else. Another turn in his life. In grade 7, a boy took admission in his school( let he be X) who started to sit in the lectures along side him. X was an overall champion. Good in studies, participated actively in co-curricular activities and fair at sports as well. Everything that a secondary school teacher wanted. The boy enjoyed his friendship with his friend X but there was one thing he could not digest. If he can do well, then why can't I. So, he started again, in a quest to be better than his fellow friend. He started panting in his way, tiring more than usual. But he had to prove something to this world. THAT HE CAN DO IT. All his activities started to be designed in such a manner so that he can get one step forward in achieving his goal and records slowly started reflecting it. From 78 percent, his percentages started rising to 82, 87, 89, 91 and 92. It was finally in grade 10th that he could reach his goal. Yes, he did it. He defeated the topper, the best one around. But in the due course he lost his friendship due to jealousy of Mr. X. But from here he never looked behind. In grade 11th and 12th, he started preparing for IITJEE, one of the toughest exams in India where only 1 out of 50 registered candidates are successful. But he had learned now that looking behind will not do any good. After two years of hardship, which he had started to enjoy thoroughly, he came out with flying colors. He had defeated those 49 students out of 50 who had used to call him a dumb, loser and what not. Optimism and patience can do wonders..... really.    Yes, that's what I learned. P.S.-    This is my life story in short for you.I am still not good at english. Remind me about grammatical mistakes, if any.",

But I think volunteering at my Primary school, might be my legacy. Who knows what child I may have touched and helped. Or as a donor of platelets for babies and cancer victims, maybe I will save the life of someone who will save the world. I used to work the local polls (everyone should do that for at least one election), but that will never lead to a legacy. I have three grandchildren, 2 of which are extremely smart, maybe it will be them. But truth be told, I think a lot of people would be surprised if after their death, they found out their real legacy. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really known until then. ",

So I had two of the worse mental illnesses in the world, then I discovered my phone got hacked. So, I couldn't study, or talk with friends or get a gf. So, what I did? I cured my schizophrenia in a record time, I don't have delusions, voices in my mind or hallucinations. It took a lot of time of reasoning, but that investment was good. Also I completely controlled my OCD, was hard as hell, it took every day thinking how could I improve my symptoms. These are my two life achievements, I did more than 99 percent of the people with such illnesses in less than two years. Also when I was a teen I hacked sxe injected which was a program used in games, I was so successful that they had to change the whole thing 9 times with 9 different versions. ",

I stuck with hospitality yet only achieved what I learned from that class. Other lessons such as Science, Maths, English and Social Studies I never gave mind to. So in the end of leaving school. I finished my studies, obtaining level 1 literacy and numeracy. To be honest I thought that was what I would achieve. But when I moved from Taumarunui to Auckland and enrolled in a course teaching residentials literacy and numeracy level 2. I earned myself that level of achievement and then got onto a NZMA (New Zealand Management Academy) course doing hospitality level 3! Well, doing just that I went to level 3 literacy and numeracy in which you can obtain if you stuck to the hardwork in school! SPITE OF THAT I was pretty amazed but I wouldn\u2019t say this was enough development in learning to make me want to start university. Not with the accomplishments I got when I left at the age of 18yrs old. I wish I done better tbh! ",

Fast forward 4 years,now one day this guy went to an amusement park with his friends and when he saw his friends going for a ride in one of those swings,he sat down with them but the past memories came to his mind and he just got off from it saying you guys enjoy I will join u later,next they all went to another ride and same So after 3 rides,this guy decided to sit in one of those so in order to make him feel safe his friends accompied him,now when the swing was about to start,the guy said that he would not make it and please let him go off,but his friends asked him to keep his calm and just have trust,now as the ride moved the heart of the boy started skipping,now when it reached at its top then moved to the most fun part,you know what the actually started enjoying,now all his fear and anxiety was gone, at that moment the only thing he knew was fun and happiness achieved by those rides. Yes that boy was me and that day I finally gave up on my fear of sitting on swings.It was like conquering your biggest fear and that day holding to my decision to stik to that ride was the best decision i took.Now my friend don't have to face the constant rejection from my side,on not sitting on one of those.:) It's was one of my biggest victory.

At a time when everyone is running in a rat race to earn a lot of money, I have reached a stage in my life where the lust for the money is almost nil. I see a lot of people around me dying to earn money, fame and power. They work hard and forget to have a breath in peace. They don't enjoy the present and worry about the future, which they may never be able to live. Whereas I smile, happily, standing in the middle of the farm, under the hot sun, without any reason. Being able to stay happy, in almost every situation, is the biggest achievement, so far. ",

During the worst part of my life and their childhood I was married to a crazy guy - he was on drugs, stimulants, and just had some very strange ideas about life in general. Both I and my three kids suffered because of it, and I was trying so hard to get out of the marriage that I wasn't there for them enough. However, they grew up to be wonderful, happy, smart people with good marriages and family lives, and me? Well, I survived. So I guess I'd say that they are successes on their own merit - but I claim them, because I'm their mom, and I can! Thanks for asking! ",

            "answer_text": "I was really depressed for many years after my break-up, so when I completed my BCA, I came to Hyderabad to fulfill my dream of studying in NIFT. My brother and his wife were living there. I stayed for two years to complete my studies. When I joined NIFT, I was proud and I left behind my sad memories in my hometown so as a gift my brother bought me my first Android phone. I was happy to use it and installed many apps to try. One ofthem was a ebook reading app. During my sleepless nights, I used to read a lot of free e-books. This was 2012. Then I got so busy with my fashion studies that I forgot about anything else. I completed my studies and went to another city to work as designer but due to my health issues, I came back to my hometown. Being a self-respected girl, I was feeling like a burden on my family. Though, they never made me feel like that. In my hometown, I started working as a designer/manager in a boutique with a minimum salary. So, it kept me busy, I started laughing a lot, spent good days with my parents but during the night time, my mind was quite active. Every night till 3 am, either I was watching movies/series on laptop or listening to music or I was reading e-books. Suddenly, one night, I thought of a story that I imagined to share but I was quite hesitated first but then, on the same ap,p I started writing, I don't know why but I never expected anyone to read it. After writing few chapters like someone writes on their diary, one night I got a notification that someone liked and commented on my last written chapter. I checked and saw that someone has written, \u201cwow, what an un-usual story, I am liking and eager to know what is gonna happen next, please update the next chapter soon.\u201d I felt like, I got an oscar for best writer. This encouraged me so much that I kept on writing and from one to two and then two to twenty thousand readers started liking my book. This was totally unexpected and overwhelming. I didn't realise but within a year, I became an author though I never ever dreamt of it. My book ranked #1 in romance, drama, interracial loverstory categories. I was jumping like a monkey on my bed but i didn't know who to share this secret of mine because no one knew in my family that now their daughter & sister is an author. Gathering all my courage, I told my sister in law and brother, they were totally amused. My mother too knew about my secret writing skills, she started reading my e-book too. I was feeling a little awkward because obviously, it was a romantic story and I was shy to share it with my family. But, after reading few chapters, my brother told me. \u201cStupid, why are you writing for free, never give your time, talent and hardwork for free. Publish it on a paid platform.\u201d After editing my book completely, I decided and publish my book on Kindle. After a month, I got my first payment. It was \u20b94200. I couldn't believe my eyes, I called my brother and cried a lot and said thank you to him for guiding me. My mother got the news and she was happy then finally I told my dad that, \u201cI am an author and lots of people are buying my book, I don't know how.\u201d My father smiled and proudly said. \u201cIt's genes, you never know when it will work.\u201d P.S. My father is a retired radio announcer, he was a drama artist, singer and also a painter. He had written science fictions, poems and many books. He plays flute too. I am a good illustator, an art lover, an okay okay singer and now an author! With my readers heavy demands, I am writing the second book which is a spin-off story to the first one. And soon, I will publish that too. This one is my book. \u263a\ufe0f Pujari, Shriya: Amazon.in: Kindle Store ",

No achievement is big or small, because at certain points we have given our 100% on it and worked hard to reach it . So here are few of my small and big achievements as you asked Small achievements 1 ,2,3,4,5 - no achievement have been ever small to me , because these small achievements helped me reach the big ones so they are big themselves . Big achievements 1- SURVIVAL - i think since past few years , survival have been my biggest achievement . At very certain points i was about to give up and shatter down but still i headed up an I'm here now ,not giving up or will ever give up in future. 2- MY FAMILY - not just in terms of saying but they have been by my side always and never let me down 3- MY TRUST TOWARDS MYSELF - one thing i am so proud of if that i never doubted on myself that i couldn't do anything ,but i always had a positive thought that i can do it i want to. 4- MY POSITIVENESS - this is something which have boosted me up always , because being positive is something which gives a very great approach to us and keep us moving on our way. 5- CONFIDENCE - not just as we should always be confident. , But being alone and confident , having no one by my side and being confident was a great cherry on cake .

One has to think in quadruple ways if not think in square all possible outcomes in terms of plans A,B,C & D. I was working in my career profession but saw inevitably that i would be let go contract terminated. Therefore I thought what can I do outside of my work yet keep my I.T. skills in computers? Back in those days several years ago from now that Youtube was popping up just about in every field of subject, yes I thought of turning myself into a YouTuber. There are 24 hours in a day how one utilizes them whether in bad to good instances of any situation is totally upto you in comparison to logging on to facebook often? I am not in anyway against facebook or anything but my facebook is my youtube I suppose. Yes certainly there are many facebook profiles popular than my youtube but I would never trade my youtube for popular facebook account of someone\u2019s. It took me 4 years instead of 6 months as I initially thought to fully understand background internal workings of the concept of YouTube videos. Back to our scenerio of 24 hours a day, now I completely feel the heat for being the Youtuber that I am I couldn\u2019t cherish to value the utilization of time in any given day! There simply aren\u2019t that many hours for post production to research on topic at any given day. I am glad I am YouTuber and delighted I made the decision to pick up the skill-set. ",

We didn't have supervised visitation in those days. He scared me to death. It was like living in what I imagine a war zone would be like: dodging verbal bombings at all hours of the day and nights. I'm finally becoming able to shake off all the intrusive thoughts, triggers, and heartbreaks I lived through because of the horrible way he treated the children - and myself. When I close my eyes at night, it's finally quiet and peaceful, instead of filled with the echoes of his ugliness. ",

Being a Chartered Accountant is a matter of pride because there are only 3 Lakhs Chartered Accountants in the world. Certificate which reminds me the hard work that I have put in for four years to achieve it.  Its not just the final exam of Chartered Accountancy where you have to work ur ass off but in the entire journey. CA entrance exam CPT required me to get serious regarding my career in just few months which is a very big transition because I had just completed my schooling. Intermediate stage IPCC required 9 months of sheer dedication because my class timings were from 7 AM to 9 PM almost everyday. After IPCC the real journey started where I was required to do three years of article-ship from 10:30 AM to 6 PM along with my college. Article-ship gave me practical expsoure in various fields like Audit, Taxation, Finance and Accounting. The last and the biggest hurdle in my journey of becoming a Chartered Accountant was the final exam which required 6 months of studying and staying at home. It tested my patience and dedication. My perseverance lead me to become a Chartered Accountant. Biggest Achievemnet of my Life.  Thank you Kindly Upvote, Share & Follow Irfaan Rangwala ",

Yeahhhh,( that day came when my parents won\u2019t force me to go to school) I was happy, giggling with my friends, but I don\u2019t know-how, The teacher yell my name, I stood up immediately and all the class went silent. Every student in my class was staring at me( 160 eyes, including teacher\u2019s). And our teacher, ordered me( literally?) to give a farewell speech ( in front of the school) and that\u2019s also in ENGLISH??? It was like a nightmare come true( as I was so shy, that some of my classmates didn\u2019t even know that I exist in class and giving the speech in front of whole school was definitely the nightmare). After that evening, returning to home, avoiding 100 of gazes from my \u2018classmates\u2019, I came up with a brilliant solution. \u201cBunking for that day\u201d. But I don\u2019t know why I brush off that idea from my mind. For the first time in life, I felt that someone assigned me a great responsibility, so I worked on my \u2018nightmare\u2019- yeah means speech in English. After doing 1000\u2019s of rehearsals, in front of the mirror, my friends, and the whole class. I was ready to give the speech. With full confidence, I went on the stage, looking at everyone, without hesistation I started my speech. But yeah, a twist came, I skip one passage and then I was unable to remember anything from my speech. For 1 minute I was looking at the crowd in front of me, confused. But then I brushed off the speech layout from my mind and said all the true feelings about my friends, teachers, and school. And after completing my speech, a loud applaude make my hearing senses weak. But that moment I felt so much proud of myself. ( Yeah, self-confidence saved me that day) And guess what? I won the prize from my principle for giving a great speech( I know some thoughts from my speech was not appreciated( but it was the reality) For the first time, I spoke in front of the masses what I felt. Hence that day I gain self-confidence which is the best accomplishment of my life. ",

I became a good friend of hers and she started calling me late at night. Though I thought this both strange and flattering I suddenly realised inside she was a complete mess. Nearly everyday she would call in tears, upset at the most trivial things. The conversation would get darker and darker until she would talk of suicide. Friends asked why I put up with this but I knew all I had to do was listen, which cost me nothing. This continued for years until one day, she seemed to have fixed herself. It felt strange no longer getting calls and I have to admit I was worried. About 5 years later I was walking through central London late at night when a car stopped. It was her. She called me over and there was a very handsome man in the front and a gorgeous little girl in the back, her husband and daughter She got out the car and walked with me a bit. As we parted she told she cried and told me how our late night chats saved her life and really made her want to live again. ",

I am blessed with two children and professionally reached the highest position possible - Dean and a Syndicate Member. This is because of God's grace, some family support and my hard work.

            "answer_text": "There are few biggest achievements which boosts my confidence and the conscience I drew to me. I speak alot to people and make everyone happy around me. But on the other hand, I hurt their feelings sometimes. I had been a total menace to many. For some, I was like a hell and unbearable. Even though, I had a very good circle of friends around me most of the time. or I should say, I used to have friends. I never had a personal life apart from them or apart from my family. But then due to some bad decisions, I was left alone on my own. You can see me with friends or Relatives or Colleagues. But I am always a loner to keep my worst nightmares with me. I feel that as my biggest achievement and worst nightmare. By dealing with my own feelings, I become invulnerable to others and I can take a stance for my own feelings. Getting to this point is hell. But still I live with it. Once acquired, cant be taken out from you. Atlast, I stand as an individual for a team game. ",

Even before I could properly begin my trip, Murphy caught me.  Snowstorms and landslides crippled North Sikkim tours and I had to adapt my travel plans. That\u2019s the best part about solo trip - Do whatever the hell you want to. My hostel friends suggested I go to Pelling.  So off to Pelling I went. I had no idea how to reach or what to do there. Long story short, I managed to find a great hostel, made good friends with other backpackers and experienced totally new food.  Pelling has a glass skywalk, a mini version of the Zhangjiajie Glass Bridge. So, there is this deceptive sign that says - Skywalk 1.5Km ahead. Like most Indians, I assumed 1.5 Km corresponds to approx 30 mins because of the hilly area. Had I known earlier, I probably would have bailed out. Because that 1.5km took me nearly an hr. Ok, fine, I admit, I am not in my fittest shape and my heart sucks. But still, I did NOT expect a whole frigging hour. \u00a00:00-0:30 0:00-0:30 0:00-0:30 0:00-0:30 0:00-0:30 Finally after an arduous climb of at least an hour, I managed to get to the top and got rewarded a grand view.     My achievement: I did not give up halfway and continued to trudge ahead. Adios, Jayit Ghosh ",

            "answer_text": "It is very important in your life to count your blessings and feel good about your achievements. That will give you positive aura which gives more success in your life. Psychologists around the world say make a habit of thanking God for what you got in life instead of always thinking about what you lack, and I firmly believe in that. There will be few things in life, you feel proud of yourself. They may not be notable achievements in the eyes of other people. But for myself, they are great achievements and I am proud of them.  In March 2018, there was a Pinkathon Run, conducted by Supermodel and Founder of Pinkathon, Milind Soman for Breast Cancer awareness. My brother called me and said he and his wife are participating in that and asked me to join. I was not sure whether I could walk 5 kilometers at a stretch, as I had back and knee issues for the past one year. But I have decided that I will give it a try and said yes to my brother. I reached the venue at 5.30 am in the morning and I could not believe my eyes. There were so many women gathered there and my brother was a volunteer, as men are not allowed to participate in that run. I was overwhelmed when I saw the energy outburst there. I could have felt sorry if I did not say yes to participate in that event. I was carried away with the magnitude of the event and completed my 5 km run without a break. I am so proud of my achievement and always cherish it as a great milestone in my life. It gave me confidence that I can achieve anything if I really want to. ",

She said I am asking about valuable stuff like material things, money, business or job and things like that. I replied \"Yes, I told you the most valuable things I have achieved in life. Along with that, I have long list things including those you mentioned but I am telling you the most valuable things in life. Unless you achieved what's most valuable.. rest everything isn't enough.\" You don't have to always identify yourself with your job or designation or with the money you have made or the things you have acquired. They are definitely an integral part of life and sooner or later you will have them all. However, if you are not achieving the most valuable things in life which are always intangible then none of the things that you achieved is going to give you have a blissful life. ",

This was to make up the lost 1 year as I failed in 2nd standard and was made to study another year in the same class.My first car. Maruti OMNI van. I had many family emotions attached with it but after using it for 10 years, gifted it to my brother.The letter which I got as a reply from Maneka Gandhi who was the pioneer of running a society called People for animals.

Literally everyone grew professionally and personally. I feel proud of them. Few of them are in Quora too.My daughter's 87% pass mark in her 10th CBSE. Nothing less than my achievement although it was her accomplishmen.My wife completed her 10 years of teaching service in DPS. (I am the culprit who encouraged her to work and she has come a long way since then). So you can call me narcissist.We would be celebrating our 19th wedding anniversary in November. You must be wondering what's the big deal? Well - we rarely fight. We have our difference of opinions though but we sort it out amicably. While there is nothing glorifying in this, let me tell you, we have seen the ups and downs of life and have toiled to come at this stage. I have never abused my wife physically or emotionally. Although she takes very good care of me, I take the credit.These are just a few that I could think of at the moment and I shall add further if I recollect any. Wishing you most and more. ",

I think of this as my best. Asking and receiving is truly wonderful, but time spent in another world with a citizen of another plane that is also the Father's creation? That's just beyond anything I call my own, even as it is a shared event. They have feelings too, the sad face of the slight female being , as I was being taken back home, was hard to handle. It was the only time I saw that look, you do not want to sense her kind suffering, especially over you, you do not want to have any part of it.

Or was it a failure that he still ultimately murdered his wife and killed himself? And why rank my accomplishments as if one is greater than another? I have earned degrees, certificates, etc., in a variety of areas. But why would one necessarily be my \"biggest triumph\"? And, while those certainly build my confidence, they cannot entirely fulfill my sense of self-worth. I prefer to be a human being versus a human doing. I know that is a radical concept! But I do hope to come to terms in some fashion with some of my feelings of disdain toward humanity (of which I am a part) before the end of my life. ",

This avoids stresses and strains associated with setting goals including are they the right goals, achievable goals, written down or not and so on. It also avoids stresses and strains associated with achieving goals or not. Instead, the energy that would be used up dealing with the stresses and strains is focussed on doing things I want to do, are interesting, I enjoy, are fulfilling and so on. It can be interesting to ask: Is it absolutely certain your life will somehow be better if you set and achieve goals?Is it absolutely certain your life will be worse if you don't set and achieve goals?If you do things that interest you and you enjoy but don\u2019t set goals for, are you certain it will always end in failure?If you don\u2019t set goals and do things that interest you and you enjoy, will any success be somehow less because you have not set goals?What is it, what knowledge and influences, have led to my answer for the above questions? As children, we do and achieve things without knowing what a goal is, so where does our need for goal setting come from?If goal setting works for you, great! If not, doing what you want and enjoy has an equal likelihood of ending in success. ",

We had some guests who had arrived recently at home. Everyone was busy in their hospitality. :D I too had my college that day. I had to leave early. As everyone was way too busy, I decided to help. I went to kitchen, started shaping some of the Pooris[1]. Later, I ended in frying some of the puffed Pooris too. Then, I was dressed up for my college. Maa called- 'Where are you going? You haven't eaten anything yet. Wait!' I said- 'Maa, I have already fried some of the Poori(s). Just serve me some. ' She smiled - Thank you so much beta! Muahh! You're my best Chandu! She kissed me on my cheeks. It was a pure bliss! I was satisfied that she was happy. :) Footnotes[1] poori recipe or puri recipe, how to make pooris | indian poori recipe",

I\u2019ve had personal success in business and have started 6 businesses, but being a Dad is more fulfilling in so many ways than professional or material accomplishment. Raising two young men who are honest, honorable, open minded, and having great senses of humor as well as being respectful of women would be my greatest success as well as joy. Are they perfect? No, but no one, including me, is. But creating two people who can contribute to life and society as well as enjoy it themselves will always be my biggest life success! ",

It was in 11th grade. Everyone was happy with their semester 1 result. I was also happy because I also got good marks. But I thought that if I enjoy with this marks I will get only one good marksheet; but to get more good marksheet like that I continue my preparation & also increase my reading hours.(In 1st sem we only had 100 MCQ while in 2nd sem we had to answer 50 marks questions & 50 marks for MCQ. So 2nd semester is tough for most.)So with good strategy & reading preparation I got increament in marks. Most of students were saying that mathematics paper was very hard. Also many students were getting marks less than 33 in maths. But due to more practice & love with maths I got 98 out of 100, which was great achievement because I got 1st rank merit wise in my hostel. I was happy. Also I got good marks in chemistry which was not my subject. After seeing result I thought \u201cNow I know how it feel after doing hard work & staying patient with other feelings.\u201d On next day of result we went for movies (all hostel boys, which was preplanned), where also our mathematics sir was present and he said in front of everyone,\u201dNeel, te maru naak kapata bachavi lidhu(you saved my reputation).\u201d So yeah that was my one achievement. After all this, in 4th semester my school organized a science fair & we created a model of dam -\u201dSardar sarovar dam\u201d. So I was very happy that we created that model about 2 metre * 1 metre. We created that thing from wood & then we coated with a plastic that can prevent water likage, because we made a working model of flowing water from damn. We also bought a statue of Mr. Sardar Patel of 3000rs. Yes you read it right,3000rs. So we enjoyed that project because it was made after using different techniques for likage proof, electric work for lighting & pumping of water, instruments, gums, cellotapes. We were really tired after that two days fair. But also happy. This was my second achievements. I don't have pic of project but I have a picture of my group.  Now, my third and most best achievement is just before science fair our school organized an event for prize distribution for 3rd semester. In which I was also selected. For that two year my father & our principal(also physics professor) were knowing each other very goodly. So at event he called my father on stage for his review. He said that he was happy to get me into that school, he was very happy with my marks & that school had very good strategy to teach students. I was like \u201che is very happy with me, what else in world I want from life.\u201d So these are my achievements. And last one seeing your own parents happy with you is the best one. ",

Since they are 21 and 19 years old they have their own lives and I make sure that they know that I am so proud of them. My other achievements was when I bought a home with my mother for her and my siblings. Also when I helped the father of my children to purchased a home for his parents and our children. I like to help others because I get so much happiness, therefore I will continue to build others as long as I am alive. ",

It is important to keep the future in mind. As a young person my life was filled with awards and achievements, but at that age they are more prevalent. I cannot pick one of those, they were just confidence builders. The simple answer would likely be landing a great job in the oil patch, it paid for many great things in my life and I got to see much of North America because of it. It took a lot of hard work and some public speaking which I wasn\u2019t used to. ",

I was doing all my stuff as earlier but just added 1 hour of walking and jogging daily without fail. After 3 weeks time result started to show which motivate me further to continue the same. After 8 months of continuous effort i finally acheived my target. Note: This was achieved without any professional help and gym.

You are happy with everyone as you have learnt to forget small things and cherish the importance of your life. You might be facing failures but that does not bother or affect you mentally and your social impact remais as it is. You have some impactful remarks when you are speaking in a group or a community. And lastly you have no regrets for what you have done so far. You have made your own rules and you have capitalized on it.

When a man thinks of the objects, attachment to them arises; from attachment desire is born; from desire anger arises. Krodhaad bhavati sammohah sammohaat smriti vibhramah;Smritibhramshaad buddhinaasho buddhinaashaat pranashyati. Meaning - From anger comes delusion; from delusion the loss of memory; from loss of memory the destruction of discrimination; From the destruction of discrimination he perishes. Raagadwesha viyuktaistu vishayaanindriyaishcharan;Aatmavashyair vidheyaatmaa prasaadamadhigacchati. Meaning- But the self-controlled man, moving amongst objects with the senses under restraint, and free from attraction and repulsion, attains to peace. Prasaade sarvaduhkhaanaam haanir asyopajaayate;Prasannachetaso hyaashu buddhih paryavatishthate. Meaning- In that peace all pains are destroyed, for the intellect of the tranquil-minded soon becomes steady. (When peace is attained all miseries end.) Naasti buddhir ayuktasya na chaayuktasya bhaavanaa;Na chaabhaavayatah shaantir ashaantasya kutah sukham. Meaning- There is no knowledge of the Self to the unsteady, and to the unsteady no meditation is possible; and to the un-meditative there can be no peace; and to the man who has no peace, how can there be happiness? Indriyaanaam hi charataam yanmano'nuvidheeyate;Tadasya harati prajnaam vaayur naavam ivaambhasi. Meaning- For the mind which follows in the wake of the wandering senses, carries away his discrimination as the wind (carries away) a boat on the waters. What is your biggest achievement in life? I haven't achieved it yet but I desire to accomplish the state of perpetual motion. I want to attain peace of mind(Well,who doesn't?). Which in way means no gloominess,no stress,no depression. Note- In no way I am promoting any religion or book. In fact I am an \u201cagnostic atheist\u201d. I read religious books just to impart moral values and most importantly to get motivation (which in my opinion are as good as ted talks or sandeep maheswari are). ",

Everything in our lives, little matters to big matters, all have their own value at which we determine what to do with those matters. We make life choices and think about our value. We think about how important it is for us to do something and how much value doing something is. I value my schooling. But do I value it over sitting and watching movies all day? Do I value movies over my GED? No. What we value and being able to accomplish an understanding of value is what makes life a little easier and more manageable. ",

Aside from saving lives and giving direct care to demented people, I\u2019ve written 3 novels, short stories, and several volumes of poetry. I hitchhiked from Belgium to India, built a cabin in the woods with no power tools, and so forth. But these things, though interesting, aren\u2019t truly great. Saving people\u2019s lives is very good, but other people can claim that as well. Becoming a balanced human being has certainly paid off. When I was about 25, I took to heart the teaching of Carl Jung, the eminent Swiss psychiatrist, who explained that each of us is half male and half female, and that the realized human being awakens and blends the subordinate half. This makes us step outside gender constructs while still feeling comfortable with them. Awakening my female half made me an excellent listener and a decent actor (because I\u2019m not emotionally frozen). The result is, that after decades of floundering, I now have excellent social skills. ",

            "answer_text": "Experiencing the fact that life is full of self fulfilling prophecies. Your thoughts create the world around you because you look for things to confirm the beliefs you hold. To break it down - the thoughts you hold influences the way you perceive and interact with the world, your perceptions determine your mood, your mood can determine the quality of your life and your actions bring you closer to the goals you believe are attainable. If you believe that the universe is friendly and that the world is full of beauty and wonder, you can train yourself to see the good in situations and people regardless of what other people may perceive them to be, when you do this your interactions become more positive, your mood elevates and your quality of life is unreal. This is antithetical to what we are socialized to believe - that there are objectively \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019 things that can happen to us. And that the quality of our life is determined by whether these external situations are overall more \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019. Really any given situation is neither \u2018good\u2019 nor \u2018bad\u2019, those are labels we ascribe primarily as a result of our socialization. Resilience is really just training your mind to focus on the growth and opportunities in any situation. It took me some time, and lot of reading to learn this but achieving internal peace and a state of predominant bliss is something I am extremely grateful for. ",

This also could mean if we are able to satisfy our desire even if that could be in our work life and with minimum vested interest. Yes we would be satisfied in many instance which could be noteworthy but we forget the important portion usually. Generally satisfied feeling we associate with fulfillment of desire which is dependent on results and is remembered because of the result we have in record. The result could be promotion or getting an important order or completing an important milestone. There is also another type of satisfaction which we have experienced many times without having the end result to be recorded. This is when we have worked on a mission or objective, it could be research finding or solving personal problem which has been lingering for years. How did we achieve it? We take the initiative now in addressing seriously (could be a starting thought), be focus and try all that is needed, running pillar to post, search various libraries, surf internet and interface with others to find value and get some direction. The process continues for many weeks or months as the problem could be but in this period we are satisfied many times because we have taken many steps which we would not in normal condition. The determination and focus enables to make ceaseless running we think important and do in search of matter or discuss with others. After the day\u2019s toil we are satisfied, the task is not complete but the effort we have put is satisfying. It is the process we are undertaking actually is satisfying which has hidden power we miss which has a lasting lesson by an aware or alert mind. A wise mind could use the gist in normal condition because next time the situation would be different in a different problem with different types of solution. Similarity could be the nature of focus and readiness to exert all variable we have to try even if that amounts us to move away from our comfort zone. On these grounds yes I have experienced satisfaction many times and even if results were good the goodness of relishing of results were later and minimum but the core for achieving satisfaction has registered to mold the inner nature. Today I have been explain young people at work to experience this type of satisfaction which is so near and which can be a cause of beautiful future without wasting time in expectation at least when it is not needed. What good I have achieved in the end is \u2018peace of mind\u2019 that is a result by tracking and maintaining peace more important than the material fruits always. NOTE: The query I have answered was unclear and with words \u201cHave you ever achieved good in your life\u201d. The beginning of my answer may appear sensible only when we can differentiate the original query with the present one in which it is merged. ",

The land mafia & the local MLA got his papers disappeared from the local office & made a false case of the land being taken back by the local Govt, in lieu of the land not getting cultivated by my father! He had been posted to Haryana from Gujarat & there was no way he could have cultivated the particular land! Also, it wasn\u2019t even fertile, the land! That\u2019s when my father began his struggle to get back what was rightfully his! The legal battle took a dent with his death in 2012. I, being his youngest daughter, took over the case, with both my elder siblings showing no interest in the case! I pursued this diligently, away from my family & kids for long gaps of time, fought fearlessly for something that belonged to my father! Being a single woman, with my husband looking after the kids in Mumbai, I visited old offices practically every day of these long years. I was meted veiled threats from the land mafia, but turned a deaf ear to them! After a relentless struggle, I have managed to regularise the plot with dogged determination & am extremely proud of my own achievement!! ",

I was a fat kid and got made fun of in school because of it. But being called fat repeatedly is what motivated me to lose weight. I went from 220 to 170 in 3 months. 50 pounds. Here's how I did it: I stopped drinking pop. I only ate the serving size of foods. This means when I had lunch, which was a bologna sandwich and chips, I only had 1 slice of bologna, 1 piece of bread, and 11 chips. Instead of grabbing a handful of Doritos I literally counted 11 chips from the bag.I went walking several miles each day at a local park. I also did a whole lot of sit ups gradually increasing the number until at one point, I was doing 800 a night. (Not all at once. I did sit ups at night and did 10 sets while watching TV, doing sit-ups during commercials. So when I did 800, I was doing 10 sets of 80.) ",

I am sharing my achievements in life and you may choose the biggest one as for me, all have been humble ones. 1. Failed in 12th standard, but completed studies(masters) and now training students of that particular school and college only. It was embarrassing to receive award from the management that asked me to leave the school in 12th standard. I did not feel over pride as teachers much be respected. 2. After failing in 12 standard, i worked on my communication and leadership skills. My communication skills trainer was the girl at my neighborhood i had crush on(she rejected me because of my poor communication). their husbands worked with me, i would not like to disrespect them by saying \u201cworked under me\u201d** 3. Became one of the youngest manager in Mcdonads\u2019 India at the age of 19 where i mopped the floor and clean utensils without realizing many a time that many (known) people saw me doing those stuffs. however, it was my work and i was proud of it. still, i am 4. Worked with Rajesh Roshan and Saroj Khan to train upcoming singers and dancers 5. Fought Tumor cyst and recovered with flying colours 6. Handling a mentally challenged yet cute younger brother like my own child. He was asked to leave his school in Rohini, New Delhi and now knows all the chief ministers of India without going to school after 1st standard. I challenge how many of that school know all chief ministers of all states of India.** 7. Did not get a non-egoistic and humble girl till now so, remained unmarried. My es gf\u2019s left me because i had financial losses. i do not blame them as they had all the rights to secure their future. However, husbands of couple of them worked with me (not under) unknowingly 8. Won a national-award in 2018 for being the most promising public-speaker and Master life-coach in training people to become trainers and public speakers 9. Have been taking Live online classes since 2008 when it was not a common concept in India. The idea was not welcomed by many in the beginning 10. After lockdown, i shall be awarded by MHRD minister of India for running candid Live online courses for more than a decade Keep smiling Keep shining 9717879813 LinkedIn - Manish Raj Sharma- the edupreneur  ",

Everything I have achieved most of my life was in a attempt to make my mother proud of me and to show I was not without purpose. Everything I achieved up to recently she would top trump with somebody else's achievements. Eventually I lost the need to have anybody feel proud of me, even myself, and I just aim, as usual, to do my best in anything I do. I believe if I do something I should do the best job possible and beat myself up badly when I cannot achieve as much as I want to. ",

I must say all of them were champions, getting highest grades at state level, winning a prestigious match for their college, getting a new car, being placed in an prestigious MNC\u2026 These were the several answers from the trainees. I honestly had no answer there speaking up to this question, and it's my turn: \u201c Honestly speaking I haven't achieved anything in life so far. I didn't top in any exam, remained an average student throughout my career, failed several times, didn't do absolutely outstanding in anything. But I'm extremely overwhelmed speaking here about achievement. There were days when I just hoped that this day Will be the last day for me, there were days when I slept sobbing, there were days when everything remained an uphill for me. Setting all apart I'm here smilingly addressing this Hall. Getting a couple of centuries may be termed as achievement for kohli. Adding few crores to the business may be termed as achievement for Ambani. Spending crores to the charity may be termed as achievement for Tata. Getting a good audience response to any film may be termed as achievement for any actor. For me standing here n sharing these words with you is not less than achievement.

            "answer_text": "Aside from love and patience for many that most would find questionable to do so for, my greatest accomplishment is the writing of my book \u201cAdam And The Dreamfish\u201d about a young boy who is visited in the night by a magical dream fish. Dream fish are our dreams by night but fish by day in the oceans and as the oceans get sick and die so do our dreams. When the young boy finds this out he seeks to warn everyone but adults are notoriously thick so he finds his friends and his Native studies teacher (Canada) to help him. I wrote it in three books in the UK on vacation but when I got back to Vancouver I knew i had to condense the idea to get it done quickly as others were already using parts of it that I had talked on line about . So I tried to shorten it to a kids reader and self published on Lulu.com. Link Below . Then Apple and others picked it up in ebook copy. I have not seen much from it in terms of sales or revenue but I am proud of it the same.

Because these are the greatest things I actually acheived but could not judge ( yet, I do not try to ) that time. First when I was studying matriculation ( Xth standard - last year of High School in India ) one of our teacher used to take tuitions. His name is Deshpande Sir. I never paid his fees ( I think my father used to pay him or may be not. So far I could not gather daring to ask any one of these ) But one day ( in full year !!! ) he could not conduct the tuition class and we returned home surprisingly to our homes. The next morning he entered class with a plastic transparent bag in hand filled with 25 Paisa coins. We wondered what it all was about. Then he started distributing a coin to each student in the class and finished. He went to the his regular table and spoke \u2018I am sorry that I could not attend you yesterday, so I return here the one day fee that I charge you for this teaching.\u2019 I don\u2019t explain what I felt at that time. This was the first and most important turning point in my thought process. 10 years back when I could make my own Home, I went to his home ( for the first and last time ) and invited him to inaugurate my Home. he did come and called ( to my surprise again ) a Mantra for continuous 10 minutes !!! I really can\u2019t hold my emotions and gratitude for him. A great teacher. A simplest man in my town and a silent activist. Is that my achievement? May be or may be not, but he taught me and I got 87 marks out of 100 in English without a study of single minute.  There are many more. Some other time. Thanks. ",

I certainly won\u2019t care since I\u2019ll be dead but the thought is comforting none the less and I would hope it might lead to better things down the road.

Again something common among students. I often struggled to remember all the little things that I achieved to fill in the achievement column. But, one day, when I updated my Facebook profile to fill my working details. This happened.  This is my biggest achievement till date. I've made them proud of me, I've achieved something.

All of this from a lad who graduated from high school only because a math teacher changed an F to a D- which allowed me the credit needed to graduate with my class rather than go to summer school. When the math teacher discovered that I had been assigned to his class for the summer session the F magically became a D-. He had had enough of me. A little luck and a wise math teacher. R ",

I hail from a small town of Uttarakhand and have completed my senior secondary (yr 2009) from a Hindi medium school. There was a girl in my class named Tanuja. Schools days were going to end very soon and one day Our class teacher made an announcement that we were going to have a farewell next week. Coincidentally Tanuja was sitting beside me. She was just an acquaintance at that time. We started having a discussion about future goals and I came to know that she was having some financial issues. Imagine! here mother was a cook in a Govt. school, who used to get hardly 2k -3k per month , they were 4 siblings. She was willing to prepare for B-pharma entrance exam but due to no money she wasn\u2019t able to fill the form. Later in evening I discussed the same thing with my mother as I were willing to give her some money for the form. Next day I gave her Rs.200. for form fee but she refused to take. After insisting so much I she took it. FAST FORWARD>> 2012 >> 2014 I lost contact with Tanuja, but since it was a small town, used to get the updates from my mother. Came to know that she cleared the entrance exam with flying colors. Guess what? One day I was returning back to town and saw a small new medical store. The moment I entered there , There was SHE! ! She owned it!! I am soo happy for her. I wish her all good luck This is something which not only I consider as my personal achievement but also it gave me some life lessons Just once CHANCE and hard work can change your life.If you dream for some thing , go for it.You never know, your one help can change people\u2019s lives. So if anywhere , anytime you find some needy . HELP HIM/HER.",

Imagine those video games of you learning to control something for the first time, and how erratic things can get. So why you may ask - would I want to have it come true? Well it would be fun if I could control my range and stability, rather then being like someone flying a drone for the first time.

What is your biggest achievement in life? As I think there is no other alternative of internal satisfaction for achievements. In my case it was my internal pleasure that I felt and it's the biggest achievement in my life. During my classroom training one day I got the information that there is an employee who is admitted in hospital and his situation is very serious. He was lacking platelets in blood. There needed a person who can donate his blood and whose blood group must be O positive. Since then I was in a group of my friends. Me and my two other friends decided to go. We travelled for nearly four hours by car and reached Kolkata. After certain tests I donated my blood. Before and during donation period I was treated very well. For approximately one hour I lied on the bed. After donation I was given some light food by hospital staffs. I felt a little weakness too but I was internally very happy.  Thanks for reading :) ",

I had to retire in my late 50\u2019s, after my husband passed of cancer, due to medical problems and many surgeries. Somehow, looking back, against impossible odds, I lived in my own home and the mortgage was paid in four years (long story for another time), and I traveled - something which was so important to me. I saw 33 countries and would have liked to see l00. But what I am most proud of, among many accomplishments, is the fact that I found my life\u2019s passion to be animals and I devoted 50 years (I am 86 and still doing the job) of my life to animal welfare from a local to international level. In the beginning years, I worked in corporate executive America and did my animal work nights and weekends. When I became disabled 12 years ago, I turned to the computer to help as I could not walk any longer. I know I have helped hundreds of animals along the way. But, I have never, ever met anyone who is so dedicated as to devote 50 years of their lifetime - non-stop - to animal welfare. People love animals and many do wonders for them but they come and go or burn out. This work is heartbreaking but as long as there is a breath in me, I will continue to try to help them. ",

In this spare time I made an internet research how to earn money in lock down or through online methods. There are lots of ideas there but most of are not working only few are working. Like Blogging and Chegg. I started blogging but till yet I not receive any amount from blogging as my Adscence is not verified. But I earned around 11000 exact amount is 10986.This amount is for 1 month. I received this payment for April month as payment credited in account after month on 15th of every month.Seriously I not worked on this website I just giving my spare time as I not believe whether amount will be credited in bank account or not. But on 20th of May I received this amount this is more than enough for me. As I earned first time online. Now I came to know online we have lots of potential to earn with right strategies. So for this month I seriously worked on this site called Chegg. I calculated for this month I am going to recive around 26000 for May month.

And My blogging site also getting traffic when my Adscence got verified then I'll also starts receiving money from google ads. This is my online earning story with Chegg. ",
