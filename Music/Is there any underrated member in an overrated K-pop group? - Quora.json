            "answer_text": "Um. I mean. All idols work hard, some maybe harder than others but all work hard nonetheless. No group is really overrated. Overhyped? Many. Many many many. Many overhyped. Overshadowing the poor idols that have to work harder just to get some light (exposure). But if we talk about underrated members, there are underrated members in all groups. Lets just talk about underrated members in popular groups because I like to believe that no group is overRATED. Thank you :) BTS- Um RM and HOPE obviously. WAYYYYYYY too underrated. I mean come on, pick your favorites but don't neglect leadernim and sunshine >:( EXO- hahhahahahahahahahaha funny, LAY. Hello? OT8 stans don\u2019t come for me but I mean literally Lay is still part of EXO? How can he use Baekhyun to hype himself when he is part of EXO/???? BP- probably jisoo all I know is that Lisa stans and Jennis stans are crazy lmfao NCT- Hahah taeil and kun, period. Thank you, next. Seventeen- OKay ngl the people who normally seem to be underrated in other groups (foreign members) do really really well in Seventeen. I mean like all of them. MY BABIES ALL BE THRIVING *SNIFFLES* but Id think probably Seungkwan DK and probably scoups. Gotta love our vocalists and leader man, don\u2019t forget them. aRe You KimBAp kiDdINg mE/1 ",

            "answer_text": "No. Case in point: BTS\u2019s J-Hope. It is not uncommon to see comments from hobi stans talking about how J-Hope is so painfully underrated. Wait. Hold up. Bitch where? I don\u2019t understand. Maybe here?  Here, then?  It has to be here:  Oh how horrible! It must be so hard having the highest entry on billboard 200 for a solo act. How does he even sleep knowing he only has millions of fans around the world?? It must be terrible! We have to pray for him. Sarcasm aside, how dumb do you have to be to think that any member of Bts is underrated? Even if J-hope is the least popular, it doesn\u2019t mean he is underrated or under appreciated. So no, overrated or \u201cpopular\u201d groups don\u2019t have unpopular members. stay green grasses \ud83c\udf31\ud83d\udc9a\ud83c\udf31 ",
