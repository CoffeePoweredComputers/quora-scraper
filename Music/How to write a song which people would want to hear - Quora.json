            "answer_text": "Okay a wonderful questions. So you write songs. The primary thing while writing is that it should give you a great feeling of satisfaction that you created this. Whatever crappy or great lyrics you have. If you are confident about your creativity on a personal level then you can make your friends or very limited but diverse group of people to listen to it. Some may like it,some may not,some may ridicule you,some will make you feel like a born genius. But in all these things if you are satisfied with your song(improvements can be done at any stage by you) you have it my friend. Your music should speak what you want convey that's all. So if you really wanna convey 'save me' in a song go for it. It's you. It's your song. Edit:typo corrected. ",

If it doesn\u2019t, well whatever\u201d and have a go again. Trust in what you write. If you \u2018yourself\u2019 think what you\u2019re writing is shit, people reading (or listening) will probably feel the same way. Do not forget that the BEATLES were rejected by DECCA RECORDS. Read more on here The Beatles' Decca audition - Wikipedia Check out Johnny Cash too. Read what he wrote, it was all simple and down to earth. Write from your heart, believe in yourself. Soon people will follow. The trick is never to give up.  ",
