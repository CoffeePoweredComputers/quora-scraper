            "answer_text": "Hot Stocks to Buy Right Now It\u2019s a different market than it was at the beginning of 2018. Volatility has returned, even if it remains modest relative to historical levels. Previously hot stocks to buy, like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), are down 20% since Nov. 1, 2018. It\u2019s a choppier, more cautious, environment. That\u2019s not a bad thing, however. After a basically uninterrupted post-election rally, several stocks have seen pullbacks that provide more attractive entry points. Others simply haven\u2019t received their due credit from the market. While there might be reasons for caution overall \u2014 higher interest rates, trade war concerns \u2014 more opportunities exist as well. This more and more looks like a \u201cstockpicker\u2019s market.\u201d For those stockpickers, here are 10 stocks to buy that look particularly attractive at the moment. -Exxon Mobil (XOM) Past year performance: 3.9% I\u2019m as surprised as anyone that Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) makes this list. I\u2019ve long been skeptical toward XOM. The internal hedge between upstream and downstream operations makes Exxon stock a surprisingly poor play on higher oil prices. Overall, it leads XOM to stay relatively rangebound \u2014 as it has been for basically a decade now. -Nathan\u2019s Famous (NATH) Past year performance: 5.9 % In this market, recommending a restaurant owner, let alone a hot dog restaurant owner, might seem silly at best. But there\u2019s a strong bull case for Nathan\u2019s Famous, Inc. (NASDAQ:NATH) at the moment. NATH, too, has seen a steady decline since late 2018. The stock touched a 52-week (and all-time) high just over $100 in July 2018. It\u2019s since come down about 25%, ynet the story hasn\u2019t really changed all that much. -Bank of America (BAC) Past year performance: -9.3% Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) trades at its highest levels since the financial crisis, and has gained over 120% from July 2016 lows. Trading has been a bit choppier of late \u2014 no surprise for a macro-sensitive stock in this market \u2014 and there\u2019s a case, perhaps, to wait for a better entry point. But I\u2019ve liked BAC stock for some time now, and, as I wrote previously, I don\u2019t see any reason to back off yet. Earnings growth should be solid for the foreseeable future, given rising interest rates and a strong economy. ",

            "answer_text": "I want to start off by saying, in no way should this be construed as investment advice, I am not a financial advisor and I\u2019m practically the last person on the planet anyone should be taking investment advice from. The stock of the company I\u2019m going to discuss is also so ridiculously overvalued currently by every traditional valuation metric that it is truly a speculative case of \u201cGet in and out and don\u2019t get caught as the last one holding the bag.\u201d I think that\u2019s also the same investment philosophy to take with Ponzi schemes - Caveat Emptor, buyer beware. I find this question to be interesting, if only because it allows me to share my view on a dynamic and innovative corporation. To me, the most interesting company on the planet right now is:  I could write 20, 50, 100 pages on this company and not do it justice. I\u2019ve done a significant amount of research on this company and I still learn new things they\u2019re doing every week; new products, new innovations, new investments and new businesses the company is entering. I truly believe that besides Jeff Bezos and maybe a few other senior executives there are very few people that could tell you comprehensively every honey jar this company has their hands in. The company is so interesting that it\u2019s stock is overwhelmingly rated a \u201cBuy\u201d by analysts; at one point it was rated a buy by 28 analysts, no analyst had a hold or sell opinion of the stock. The stock is also so overvalued that it has been posited that Amazon stock returns more closely track the company\u2019s free cash flows than net income (earnings). This flies in the face of traditional financial valuation, where the value of an investment is calculated as the net present value of future cash flows. Essentially this means is that, investors are valuing Amazon as if the cash it generates and uses for investment will ALL be returned to shareholders as earnings. But there are also some reasons that maybe they\u2019re right. A thorough analysis of Amazon\u2019s business lines is beyond the scope of this response, but here is a quick summary of Amazon\u2019s three core businesses: Amazon Marketplace: This is the e-commerce behemoth that started it all, it\u2019s come a long way since Barnes and Noble scoffed at the idea that ordering books over the internet would disrupt their business model. Marketplace has low margins (it isn\u2019t very profitable), but it sure generates a lot of cash. It\u2019s also 10x the size of walmart in Gross Market Value and growing twice as quickly. The company uses the revenue generated from Marketplace to invest in new technologies and business lines.Amazon Prime: In an age where on-demand content is king, and Netflix, Hulu, Roku and various other companies are quickly making cable obsolete and introducing original content, Amazon Prime is a solid contender: Who Are Netflix's Main Competitors? Prime is another cash generating machine that Amazon uses to invest in other businesses.Amazon Web Services (AWS): A book could be written on this business line. In the 21st century, data is the new oil and data storage is an essential business. AWS has a 9 year head start on the competitors and they have taken full advantage of that. Some interesting facts about AWS:Dominant market position. Amazon has twice the market share of it\u2019s next biggest competitor (I believe that\u2019s Microsoft, with the Azure product).Extremely profitable - I believe it had 70\u201380% net margins a few quarters ago, if someone wants to fact check that number and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, feel free. The point is, it\u2019s profitable. And a lot more profitable than Amazon\u2019s other business segments.Extremely fast growing - 20%-30% revenue growth? No problem.Trusted provider of storage services - Have you heard of GovCloud? I hadn\u2019t either, but that\u2019s the secure cloud storage servers Amazon provides to the US government and other clients in need of high security.Advanced NoSQL capabilities - I\u2019m not an expert on this, but NoSQL querying is going to be huge when enterprises worldwide begin to convert their legacy systems to the cloud.Competitive pricing - AWS cuts prices all the time. Check out this Quora article from 2013: How many times has AWS dropped its price? Since its launch back in 2006, AWS been lowering its prices on various services like EC2/S3/RDS..etc many times. I m starting to lose count the number of times it has done with that... Anyone gets the exact count?. I believe they had cut prices 56 times the last I heard.Unknown end market size. This is crescendo. Who knows how big the market for cloud storage will becomes. We all consume copious amounts of data and that amount is increasing exponentially every year. I believe I saw a statistic that forecast the cloud market would reach ~$200 billion by 2020. Where does it go from there?Is Amazon going to be the first $1 Trillion dollar market cap company? I certainly wouldn\u2019t bet against it. *Disclosure: I hold a position in Amazon. And if you like this answer, upvote it, it took me a long time to type! ",
