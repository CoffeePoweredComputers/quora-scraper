            "answer_text": "Could be down to a number of reasons. Honestly, I don\u2019t think this is deliberate most of the time. Maybe it\u2019s just your personal preference, that you like those verses more. It can be a coincidence too. In case a rapper is featuring on an album of a more well-known artist, they probably want to bring their best game, to gain more exposure. Pusha T\u2019s career for example got a real boost after he featured on Kanye West\u2019s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. one of the best and most acclaimed hip hop albums of the decade. His verses on So Appalled and Runaway were both great. Look where Push is at now, he released 3 pretty good albums, his last one DAYTONA especially got huge critical praise. I\u2019d also say most features on albums are on the songs considered best, or potential breakout hits. Typically, the tracks that are considered \u201cfillers\u201d don\u2019t tend to have that many features on them. It may be just the case of the song itself being better, and that\u2019s why you consider the particular verse better. ",
