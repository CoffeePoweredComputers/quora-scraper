            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re referring to the \u2018copyright\u2019, then it\u2019s a somewhat long story. Basically, the verve took a sample of a cover of The Last Time by Andrew Oldham Orchestra, they got permission to use the sample from the orchestra, but not from the original artist, the rolling stones. So Allen Klein, the rolling stones\u2019 manager, sued The Verve. They won, and Allen Klein got 100% of royalties from the song and the songwriting credits were changed to 50/50 Mick Jagger/Keith Richards. However, my personal problem with this is that \u2018the last time\u2019 isn\u2019t really the stones song, it\u2019s an \u2018adaptation\u2019 of \u2018This may be the last time\u2019 by the staple singers, of which they gave no credit or royalties to. In my opinion, given this the verve aren\u2019t in the wrong at all, all on the stones and allen klein for being downright greedy and disrespectful to the original artist, The staple singers. (if this isn\u2019t the controversy you were referring to then i\u2019m sorry but i don\u2019t know) ",
