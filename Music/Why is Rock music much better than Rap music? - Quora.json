            "answer_text": "I believe that rock music is much better than rap music for a few reasons. Im not saying rappers are not talented, but rock music requires real instruments and real skill to play. Many rappers don\u2019t even make their own beats, and and just have to rap over them. Rock bands have to write and make their own music.Rap music uses auto tune on their artists in many songs. Although rock music might not sound beautiful, the artists put their heart and soul into what they sing and play.Rock music is all about the feeling and attitude of the music. Rock music inspires listeners and artist to do whatever the song is about. Rock can be about and uprising against something unfair, something that makes you mad, or anything else the writer\u2019s mind is on. No matter what, rock music inspired people everywhere to chase their dreams, and stand up and do things in the world. I believe rap does not wake that feeling inside of its listeners.Therefore, rock music is more important, and better than rap. ",
