            "answer_text": "Billie Eilish has a wide range of different songs- from breezy songs about multiple homocides (bellyache) to how she feels being rejected by her crush (wish you were gay). She is also known for having a lot of ASMR in her songs, for example in the beginning of \u2018You Should See Me in a Crown\u201d, there is the sound of a knife being drawn from its sheath. Another thing to know is that not all of her songs are necessarily true-although she might just be like the normal teenager with mental health issues (depression), she and her brother Finneas O'Connell sometimes like to create characters for her songs. \u201cBellyache\u201d is a good example of that. She never really killed all of her friends XD. Billie Eilish never actually intended to become famous. Her first song, which she wrote with her mum, \u201cOcean Eyes\u201d, she uploaded to SoundCloud only intending for her dance teacher to hear it. But before she knew it, the song had gone viral and remixes were being made some time after that. Here are a few of my favourites which I really recommend from her albums (in no particular order): When I was Older (inspired by film ROMA)Wish You Were GayBury a FriendYou Should See Me In A CrownAll the good girls go to Hellughh there is so many I might as well have listed every single one of her songs XD Anyway, thanks for giving me the opportunity to answer a question about her, I have been bursting for ages!

Okay I'm not one for much of newer artists that everyone listens to, I could honestly care less cause it's just not my thing and I feel like a lot of newer artists just have lost the ability to make you feel something deeply but BILLIEEEEE. <3 She deserves so much love. She is a musical mastermind, for real. Shes only 17, and so creative, talented, and really has a set of pipes! You can really hear the emotion behind her voice too which I love when an artist really shows you how their feeling. She writes her own songs & not to mention her music videos are really outside of the box as well. Shes just great. You should listen to literally anything. Theres really only one song I didnt really care for and that's one of her more popular ones currently called \u201cYou should see me in a crown\" i like the beat of it and all dont get me wrong, just didnt really care for the lyrics is all. But if I had to choose, some of my faves are \u201cbellyache\" \u201cocean eyes\" \u201cmy boy\" \u201cwhen the partys over\" \u201cwish you were gay\" \u201clovely\" \u201cbad guy\" \u201cbury a friend\" \u201cxanny\" & \u201cbitches broken hearts\". You wont regret itttttt. (: ",

Bilie Eilish is really her own genre. I mean, she fits into pop but doesn\u2019t make stereotypical pop music. She\u2019s a very energetic teen with inspiration, and she\u2019s real. By that I mean, she doesn\u2019t have a \u201cfake\u201d personality in any situation. Yes she cusses. A lot actually, but not to be demeaning, in fact. Anyways, you said you wanted songs to listen to right? Hmmmmm. Honestly? All of them. Literally all of them are amazing. But to ease you in, here are five of my favorites: when the party\u2019s overidontwannabeyouanymorebellyachei love youparty favorSo yeah, that\u2019s billie eilish. I suggest you go onto her YouTube and watch some of her performances, they\u2019re pretty great. Anyway, have a nice day!  ",
