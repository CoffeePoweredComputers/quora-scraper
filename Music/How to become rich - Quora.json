            "answer_text": "If you want to be rich ... - First, find your reason: WHY do you want to become rich?  Becoming rich is hard. This is self-evident; if becoming rich weren't hard, we would ALL be rich. It is the WHY of becoming rich that provides the passion. It's the passion that drives the massive action. It's the massive action that makes you rich. HINT: simply wanting to be rich won't do it. You'll give up at the first roadblock ... or the next. It's simply too hard without an all-encompassing reason that drives you on. - Secondly, you need to find your method. There are three ways to become rich ... you must choose at least one: 1. Luck: you can win a lottery; be born into wealth; or, marry wealthy. Aside from the obvious, there are two other problems with this option: a) if you don't learn the lessons of money on the way up, it will be a fast fall on the way down. 90% of lottery winners are broke within 5 years. Greater than 50% of marriages break up. Wealthy families often use the threat of money to ensure compliance to (their) family values in their children: ie golden handcuffs. b) there's no fulfilment in simply 'making money out of thin air'. 2. Risk: you can gamble your way to wealth in the casino (e.g. play poker; count cards); in the stock market (options trading); or, aggressively trading ('flipping') in the real-estate market. The problem with this strategy - which has been successfully employed by some of the wealthiest people in history (eg Jesse Livermore & George Soros in the stock market; Donald Trump in the real-estate market) - is that it's a white-knuckle roller coaster ride that ends in financial suicide for over 99% of those who go 'all in'. 3. Add Value - the BEST way to become rich is to add massive value. For example, in business, find a problem that affects a huge number of people and solve it. Turn that solution into a product or service. Turn that into a business. Scale up fast. Sell well before your Solution's natural lifecycle ends. Or, in real-estate, find underutilized property and add value by building, rehab'ing, or repurposing. - Thirdly, you need to protect your wealth. You need to learn the hard Financial lessons that will stop you from losing your money when you have it.  This includes: i) earning more than you spend - if you earn $20m don't spend even 10% of it a year. Instead, spend it in this order: pay Uncle Sam any & all taxes due (don't be tempted to skimp; it WILL, come back to bite you); take a small salary; reinvest in your business; then, if you have anything left over, invest (real-estate is an ideal accompaniment to business income because of its low-risk profile, stability, and tax-advantages). BONUS: in addition to your small salary, here is how you safely reward yourself for all your hard work - you can spend 5% each year of the accumulated total in your investment accounts. This should give you an enviable - and, completely sustainable, ever-increasing - standard of living. ii) pay down your expensive debt as quickly as possible - but, don't make the mistake of paying down ALL debt. Debt is an investment like any other; remember the saying \"a dollar saved is a dollar earned\"?  Well, that applies equally to debt: a % in interest saved (after tax) is EXACTLY the same as a % in interest (after tax) earned. - Finally, the most important thing to remember is that being RICH is hard work, and probably not worth the time, effort, or risk. Instead, aim to become WEALTHY: this means having enough to sustain YOUR chosen lifestyle in perpetuity, no more and no less. POSTSCRIPT: 99% of people reading this will dismiss it. They will discount the source (some random on Quora). They will harken back to some contrary advice they read somewhere (e.g. \"Pay down ALL debt\"; \"flip houses to make millions\"). They will say it reads hokey (true: this is a Quora answer written in my bathrobe). They will say: you pay for what you get (\"I need to buy that $4k eCourse on wealth that Robert Kiyosaki wants to sell me\"). They would be wrong. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll never forget that scene. The first time when I saw my mum cried\u2026 My dad worked hard, very hard. And I hardly see him around most of the time. He will only come home once every 2 months due to his job - to put food on the table for his family. I had no idea about our family financial situation that time\u2026 until one day, I saw my mum cried\u2026 for the first time, because she can\u2019t take the struggles inside herself anymore. And since then, I swear that I\u2019m going to be rich! Filthy rich! To solve all the problem once and for all. To cherish my parents. To make sure my children won\u2019t need to experience what we went through at that time. . . . I was 15 at that time\u2026 The first solution I came up in order to get rich is to work, as much as I could, to trade time with money. So I started looking for a job during my school break\u2026 Grabbing on any opportunity to earn every single penny as I able to. After 3 years of working as a waiter part-time during my school break, and finally, I graduated from my secondary education. Most of my friends are thinking to continue their studies at famous university, while I have only one aim - to make more money, fast\u2026 I got a full-time job as a waiter again in a Japanese restaurant. That\u2019s obviously not the only plan I have, I got to know some new friends, and joined them in the Multi-level marketing business because they promised that I can make a fast passive income within 2 to 5 years. It didn\u2019t work out as planned. But. One of the best habits I picked up from these group of friends (MLM) is to read. So, I started to read all sort of books about financial management, sales & marketing, self-help and much more. PS: I bought them from a pirated bookstore because they are cheaper, at around 80% off the original print book. And one of the most important books I ever read on the topic of becoming rich is Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki. He became one of my idols when I was 18. Although I don\u2019t like every single thing he published now. But there is ONE single piece of information you must know if you want to get rich. The real definition of asset and liability.  . Traditional definition Assets: Everything that you own - house, car, even your sofa Liabilities: Your debts to banks and others Real definition Assets: Everything that put money into your pocket Liabilities: Everything that takes money out of your pocket . With this, you\u2019ll have a very clear vision on how you should spend money without falling into the financial traps. Most of the thing we own, our house, our car, our sofa are actually liabilities. By mistaken them as the assets, we\u2019re going to fall into a financial black hole without us even realising it. And I am seeing many people around me making these mistakes now. I\u2019m glad that I learned about this at the age of 18 and firmly stand behind it regardless how others around me have an objection about this. . . . But the truth is, I was still poor\u2026 I had a low pay job, and I was far from rich yet. At the age of 19, my focus was \u201chow to make more money, fast?\u201d, while working for a boss is clearly not the answer for me. So, I tried everything that came to me. I become an insurance agent but no one trusts me on that... Failed. And messed up with my reputation.I involved in FOREX trading without learning the nut and bolt of how the system works\u2026 Failed. And lost five thousands bucks of savings and borrowing.I started a catering business with a few partner\u2026 Failed. And get into ten of thousands of debts, slept at McDonald for months.While I was doing all that, I still have a job. But without paying any effort on my job in the restaurant (another restaurant), I ruined the relationship with my employer and colleagues. It came to a point when I was asking myself\u2026 Really? What really makes one rich? It seems like working smart and hard don\u2019t really pay off. Everything became a mess. I decided to stay low and only focus on what I can do to survive - get a full-time job as a waiter again, focus on my side freelance work (I learned design online while I\u2019m doing all those ventures just because I like it). Slowly, I came to realise that there is only one thing is out of the equation. I always aim to get rich fast. What about instead of that, I aim to get rich - without the fast behind it? With the craving of instant gratification (get rich fast), I never persisted in working things out, I dabbled all the time. That's the main reason I failed, and the same reason failed so many others. And this makes so much sense when I came across this video by Anthony Robbins.  Getting rich is just like every achievement in life. It\u2019s not about how smart you do it or how hard you do it. Yes, they count, only when there is consistency. With that said, it\u2019s about mastery. . . . So, here is the bulleted format for you to digest everything I just said easier: Learn about personal financial management. Understand the real definition of asset and liability. Read Rich Dad Poor Dad. Start budgeting - I highly recommend YNAB (what I\u2019m using now since 2 years ago).To make more money, pick one or two skills or things you love the most and master them. Practice it deliberately. Create a system and start by taking tiny actions. Always focus on the progress but not just the goal.Remember that being rich is just the mean goal. Often time, our end goal is not to have more money or becoming rich. What is life means to you if you have all the money but no time and health to spend them. Get clear on what really money can do for you, understand exactly how much you need to live your desired life.. . . To help you get rich a little bit faster and extra action steps you can take: Focus on providing value to others. This applies to both work and business. When you\u2019re providing more value to your employer or customers, you will get more in return.Don't spend all the money you make (again, read Rich Dad Poor Dad and YNAB's blog). Invest in yourself and invest in assets that pay you additional income.If it\u2019s possible, start a business. It\u2019s not for everyone, it\u2019s not easy, but it\u2019s worthwhile. Simply because you can have more leverage from a business by getting out from the system of trading time with money.Leverage the internet, use it the right way. I can\u2019t imagine how hard is it for my parents to work their way out from financial struggles without the internet. Now is the best time to start because of the internet. Ease of information and communication is a huge leverage that people don\u2019t have 20 years ago.Work hard.. . . I'm yet to achieve all my financial goals, but I strongly believe I'm on the right path. - Dean Yeong ",

            "answer_text": "So you want to be wealthy? So what does that mean to you? Does which means that $10,000,000 in web worth or does which means that $1,000,000 annually in real income. Irrespective you will find several actions you have to take. Surround yourself with wealthy people. You will be the average of 5 individuals you encompass yourself with. So surround your self with wealthy individuals. Not so difficult appropriate? Why you need to surround your self with one of these people are the countless advantages you are able to build up from them. By just being around all of them you can actually recognise how they did it. Exactly what practices performed they use? Performed they start a tried and true business or get into something much more innovative? Performed they are doing it strictly by milling and dealing hard or by pure intellect and imagination? The more you're around wealthy folks you more you learn that you will find various ways to have here which your mileage will change.. a whole lot. find out a skill intensely. Regardless of if its becoming a jack of all positions. earning money and getting deep is a function of worth. More value, more money (usually) so you must develop a technique for creating worth. Hedge fund managers do so by predicting the markets, sales people take action by getting individuals to purchase the product and pc software designers get it done by building something. Regardless of what you want to-do you should be able to deliver value. Therefore discover location or places that you experienced that you've a comparative benefit and go after that entire heartedly. When you start to build up value you are begin to develop riches. work tirelessly. Very very hard. really the only individuals every become rich by not working hard are the people who were given it through the lottery or inheritance. You simply will not have the ability to be rich if you don't're working hard. This goes hand in hand with my point above. Lets state you can create 1 piece of worth an hour. If you only work 40 hours a-work, you only produce 40 pieces of value. That just don't reduce it. And that means you must strive at improving your art (getting that 2,10,100 bits of value an hour) and\\/or producing a lot more of that price (50,60,70 hours per week). Regardless you will have to strive and grind as you can to reach finally your goals to be rich. By surrounding yourself using men and women you wish to end up like, building an art and craft which produces lots of value and then working extremely hard towards your objective: might become rich one-day.

            "answer_text": "There ARE secrets to getting rich. And they aren\u2019t well kept secrets. They all revolve around a number of concepts that when combined are extremely effective. There is the mathematical aspect. Save. Use money to make money. Compounding investments. But there is more to it than that. It\u2019s the concept of momentum. It\u2019s a very simple yet effective principle that can be applied to all areas of life. If something has worked in the past. It may work in the future. If a business reports record earnings it may report record earnings again in the future. If a business reported a loss it may in the future report a greater loss. If a girl cheated on her ex, she may in the future cheat on you. It\u2019s not 100%. It\u2019s just more likely than 50\u201350. How can you use this concept to earn money? You could translate it straight to momentum investing and that would work. Sure you wouldn\u2019t be right 100% of the time, but you could be right over 50% of the time. Similar to this principle is the concept that the hungry don\u2019t get fed and the rich attract what they already have. What I mean by this is that people tend to ignore the homeless man who is barely scraping by yet offer opportunities to the business man in a suit and tie. Men with an entourage of women get the looks from even more women. Celebrities who have more than enough money don\u2019t have to pay for anything. People who work two jobs easily find another. The guy without a job is less likely to find a new job the longer he doesn\u2019t work. Another concept is belief, identity and attitude. Give 10 homeless people a million dollars and 9 of them will end up homeless again in the future. Take 10 self made millionaires and make them start from scratch. 9 out of 10 will become rich again. The next concept is adding value. An example would be the housing market. Someone could say: \u201cThe housing market is overpriced. There is no money to be made.\u201d but that person is expecting to buy a house and resell at a profit, WITHOUT ADDING ANY VALUE. A smarter individual knows there is ALWAYS opportunity. I\u2019ll get to that later. One could build a house and sell it for the inflated market price. People are so accustomed to the rat race that they completely miss the fact that money (building materials) truly do grow on tree\u2019s. Assets truly are built from scratch. If you build something it has value. Period. The next concept is that there is ALWAYS opportunity. Chores always need to be done, maintenance always needs to be done. New things are always being invented. Assets are always being built. Old assets are always dying. It\u2019s fact. Someone who says there is no opportunity has no idea what opportunity is to begin with. Next concept. Don\u2019t listen to anyone if you\u2019ve done your research. Think for yourself. Do you know how many people once asked me \u201cwhy are you buying bitcoins?\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t cash them out.\u201d This statement was made to me by dozens of people who were certain of what they were saying. \u201cBitcoins can\u2019t be cashed out because they aren\u2019t real.\u201d Those same people don\u2019t believe that I\u2019m now rich from bitcoin and other investments that were signaled to me through momentum strategies. I myself was skeptical of bitcoin but decided to throw logic out the window as an experiment in trading strategies. These people are still laughing at me, but I\u2019ve definitely cashed out on my bitcoins lmao. They can laugh all they want. The most important concept is optimism. A positive mind will think up positive solutions and bring about more positivity. A negative mind only comes up with negative outcomes. I learned these strategies and many others from rich people and I\u2019m now rich. I think the biggest barrier people have is themselves. Everyone thinks it\u2019s difficult. 99% of people will not do things that they perceive as too difficult. There is incredible opportunity due to this as the majority of people are not competition in the slightest. Ironically it is their competitive, dog eat dog type thinking that causes them to run around without getting anywhere. The human species could build and work together to solve every problem. Instead we war and fight because of the illusion of scarcity. Which brings me to another concept. There is more than enough to go around. People are poor because of war, inequality, fear, greed\u2026 The earth itself is abundant. Human beings are very resourceful. We get things done, period. If there is suffering it\u2019s because humans thought up and caused that suffering. If humans want to accomplish something they will. If YOU want to accomplish something you will. Period. The last concept. Do. Simply act. One step at a time. Mistakes are fine, setbacks are fine. But never give up no matter what. If you want something bad enough you\u2019ll make it happen. ",

            "answer_text": " Pick one or all three. There are three primary ways people become \u201crich\u201d (stock market, real estate, own a business). You must do your own research and determine which path(s) you might want to follow. Stock Market (7-11% return) Pros: It is easy and can be done with little capital. You can purchase parts of it every month, even automatically. A company will never come to you asking for more money (unless you short trade and deal with options). Your money will grow with everyone else\u2019s (hopefully), or goes down with everyone else\u2019s. The US stock market has a good record of steadily going up, 7-11% a year.Cons: You can lose all your money (especially if you purchase individual stocks). You don\u2019t really own anything tangible. There are expenses associated with most trading. You are not an expert, large companies pay millions of dollars to people with PhDs to figure out the market and they still cannot do it. You will rarely ever beat the market in the long term; you only want to be the market. There are not many tax breaks.Real Estate (5-15% return, depends) Pros: You actually own an asset and it will generally appreciate. People will always need a place to live. With only paying a portion of the price of the house, you can immediately begin receiving rental income for the full value of the house. The government incentives home ownership; therefore, there are many tax breaks for owning a house (all rental expenses, maintenance expenses, mortgage interest).Cons: There are normal annual expenses and then other random expenses. Need to maintain a larger emergency fund to immediately fix issues. Dealing with tenants and finding new tenants. Quality of tenants usually correlates with quality of the house (more expensive house, better tenants). If you have a property manager, it will significantly reduce your return.Own a business (unlimited return) Pros: You control everything and there is a lot of active work, time consuming. Lots of tax breaks.Cons: Extremely high failure rate. You will never retire, unless you sell the business. You need a fairly high amount of capital to start, unless you want to be in a lot debt before you even start (if a bank will even loan you the money).Of course there are many more aspects to becoming \u201crich,\u201d but the basics are usually the same, simple math and time. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": " The answer should be pretty obvious to your right now. BUY BITCOIN! No. I\u2019m only joking. Seriously, do NOT buy bitcoin or any other crypto unless you\u2019ve done a significant amount of research, know what you are getting into, and are only buying as much as you can lose. Becoming rich is not easy (to do legally). It takes a lot of hard work and a lot of intention\u2026but it is possible. For one reason or another I\u2019ve always wanted to be \u201crich\u201d. I just had this obsession even as a child of making a lot of money. I owe a debt of gratitude to my parents who were super frugal/typical first generation immigrants into the United States. They were as frugal as frugal got and so when I was younger growing up, I wasn\u2019t able to have a lot of the toys that my friends had. You have to understand though, my father used to be a janitor when he first came to America. He made $2 and hour. So to give it some perspective, why would he spend $15 on a toy for me, when he would only earn that in one entire day of manual labour? I don\u2019t blame him. In fact, I thank him. You see frugality is one of the core tenants of the wealthiest people in the world. That\u2019s why you see billionaires driving around in Ford Focuses and conversely you see professional athletes declaring bankruptcy just years after they make it big. The former understood frugality and the latter did not. So how do you become rich? 1). Be obsessed with generating wealth. Think about it constantly. From the moment you wake up to the last thought you think about at night, dedicate all your energy every day to learning about how to get rich. 2). Be Frugal. This one should come easy if you master step 1 above. If all you think about is becoming rich then you certain won\u2019t be happy seeing money leave your bank account. If you are spending more than you are earning then your progress will be backwards. Learn to control your desire for immediate gratification (buying material goods) and instead learn to be frugal. 3) Invest in yourself . Being frugal does not mean you should never spend a dime. Learn how to invest in yourself. If that means spending some of your hard earned cash to take a class on investing, leadership, or a new skill that you could market or earn more money from\u2026then you should do it! 4) Be patient. I know, I know\u2026this is probably the hardest one especially with all these bitcoin/crypto millionaires. I used to look at my peers making more money than me and get jealous\u2026and even worse the ones who had inherited their wealth and thought they were so \u201clucky\u201d. In truth, I was the lucky one to have not been given anything\u2026because it just further fueled my obsession to get rich. I don\u2019t want to get too esoteric and Tony Robbins like on you here but the secret to getting rich does inf act lie within your mindset. ",

            "answer_text": "Anyone can start to create wealth with any amount. With today's technology and mentoring there are much easier and faster ways to achieve wealth, but this is basically how I did it. I hope that it will give you an idea that you can build on. I started in 1981 with $167. I bought a gun at a flea market that I knew was worth more. I took it straight to a gun shop about three blocks away that paid me $210. I put the $167 back in our savings account and started buying and selling with the $43 profit. Before long, I was buying and selling guns at gun shows and making $200 to $300 a day. I was buying at one table and selling a few tables away. Sometimes I would only make $2, sometimes I could make $50, but I was making a profit in every sale. I took that profit and bought my first car for sale from the back lot of a big car dealer. Now I was making $200 to $2000 on each car I sold. Then I started buying wholesale pre-owned Rolex watches. I could make $100 to $1000, but I could carry ten watches on me, where I couldn't carry ten cars without my neighbors getting really upset. Before long I had enough to start buying wholesale diamonds. I could make $100 to $5,000 and carry $50,000 worth of diamonds in my shirt pocket. It was no time until I had enough money to start buying real estate. It took me four months from the time I bought my first investment property to get paid, but I made $29,000 after commissions. I had saved and made enough to start buying and holding properties. I leased the properties out and had income coming in each month. More than enough to cover the mortgages, so I bought, or built more properties. I eventually bought the pawn store company that I was working for, as it fit well with my Rolex and diamond buying. That new increased income gave me enough income to purchase more properties to rent out. I started buying commercial properties and putting my pawn stores in them. The pawn stores would pay rent that would more than cover the mortgages. I sold the last of my pawn store's in 2015 and still continue to collect rents from the owners of my old stores. I started a gold buying business in 2010 with $16K for fun and a little additional income. We will do around $2MM this year from one small location. I tell people that have very little to take a quarter, or a dollar or two to a garage sale and buy something that they know is undervalued, and list it online. I have several people that I suggested that to that have made an extra $20 to $600 a week reselling their weekend finds. They sell their jewelry finds to me. Take the money that you make and keep it seperate from your household funds. Reinvest that money into the next bigger venture. A college education will help, but you can take the specific classes that you need to run your business online or at a community college. There is no need to have massive debt and stress that goes with student loans. The trick is to use the funds that you make to do the next bigger deal. Keep doing bigger and bigger deals until you either find something that you excel at or that you truly live to do. Then it doesn't feel like you are even working. At some point your wealth will have built to more than you ever imagined that it could be. Don't forget to help others less fortunate, and to take a break or two along the way to recharge and enjoy the journey. ",

            "answer_text": "You are obviously not the only one asking yourself this question. Know that to become rich, you must first of all have a very particular state of mind. People who become rich have adopted the millionaire state of mind that the American author Harv Eker describes very well in his book \"The Secrets of a Millionaire Spirit\".  In what follows, I propose that you return to the main lines of this book, which aims to show how to become rich. Thought patterns define wealth If knowledge remains important to achieve wealth, it is not the knowledge that plays the central role. Indeed, Harv Eker argues that it is unconscious thought patterns that will define our future success. Better still, they play a decisive role in our future level of wealth. These patterns of thought and behaviour have been shaped by our experiences since childhood. Our parents play a central role in the mindset we develop During our childhood, our minds are shaped and programmed by our parents. Indeed, we absorb everything they say about money all the time. Even if we do not accept simplistic ideas and statements such as \"Money is the root of all evil\" when trying to resist them, our state of mind suffers. The result is dramatic because once adult, it becomes even more difficult to unlock the secrets of a millionaire mind. Worse still, children who have grown up with this thought pattern tend to want to prove to their parents that they can make money. This willingness to rebel does not represent a real financial plan. On the contrary, it tends to blind them and drive them away from success. On the other hand, those who learn that anything is possible with money, from an early age, leave with an advantage in life to earn a lot of money. In addition to words, our parents' behaviour also has a huge impact on our adult lives. For example, how they save, spend and earn money. If your father was an entrepreneur who wasn't afraid to take risks and invest, chances are you have a natural propensity to take risks too. On the other hand, if your father was much more conservative about money, there is a good chance you would do the same. Switch to introspection mode to modify your mental programming and unlock the secrets of a millionaire mind Once the awareness is achieved, you must do a deep introspection to find your own mental programming. Forget that your parents programmed you to believe that you will never be able to afford luxurious things. Put aside the subway-business-sleep routine and think about leaving the Rat Race by acting now. To do this, implement Tim Ferriss' 4-hour week to adopt a rich lifestyle now.  Have high self-esteem If you want to become rich, you have to believe in yourself. In this way, you will lead others to believe in you. Be careful, it's not that easy to achieve. Indeed, most of us are raised with the conviction that it is impolite to have high self-esteem. To unlock the secrets of a millionaire mind, you must understand that millionaires think differently. They don't care what other people think about them. You must fully commit to becoming rich to unlock the secrets of a millionaire mind Gathering information on how to change is unfortunately not enough. You will have to replace old habits with new ones. Thus, you will have to move on to new wealth-oriented thought patterns. To do this, you will have to follow 12 tips to become mentally strong. Dare to believe in yourself and repeat every day that you will achieve your goals will lead you to a millionaire state of mind. Nevertheless, we have nothing for nothing in life. You must be willing to make the sacrifices necessary to become rich. If this means working 16 hours a day for a given period, you must accept it and stick to it. In order to unlock the secrets of a millionaire mind, you must constantly search for the growth area. Wealth does not come alone, it must be sought. As you move towards wealth, you will have to make the choice to leave your comfort zone to reach this growth zone. Learn how to take control of your destiny to unlock the secrets of a millionaire mind You must take your destiny into your own hands to unlock the secrets of a millionaire mind. Thus, you will not be able to do so by remaining a spectator on the side of the road. In his book \"The Secrets of a Millionaire Spirit\", Harv Eker invites you to take the wheel of your destiny. The goal is not to do what the poor tend to do. They give up control of their income to others or throw their money out the window for fun. All this in the hope of getting lucky. This attitude will get you nowhere. Don't complain anymore and act. Only you have the keys to your present and future situation. Take action and make the changes that will lead you to prosperity. Think positively about money People who want to become rich must love and admire rich people. Indeed, if you despise rich people, thinking they are ruthless and worthless, then you will prevent yourself from becoming rich. So you need to adopt a positive attitude towards money. It allows you to do what you want in life. Think of it as a means. So, if your goal is to do good things, then money will allow you to do more. Set high goals and partner with the right people to unlock the secrets of a millionaire mind In life, to reach the top, you have to aim high and be ambitious. In addition, if you want to achieve your most ambitious goals, you will need to partner with the right people. Don't stay locked in your corner. Instead, you must learn to think on a large scale! Do not set a limit on your income Every time you make your income depend on your time, you limit your income. Thus, Harv Eker highlights the fact that we only have 24 hours a day. Once this time has elapsed, you no longer increase your income. Fortunately, there is a solution to this problem. Rich people, who are able to unlock the secrets of a millionaire mind, are rewarded in proportion to the quality of their results. Instead of looking for a well-paying job or producing goods that depend directly on their time, they have learned to automate their business. Here again, we come back to the approach put forward by Tim Ferriss in his book. Conclusion Achieving wealth requires unlocking the secrets of a millionaire mind. In his book \"The Secrets of a Millionaire Spirit\", Harv Eker brilliantly highlights everything it takes to become a millionaire. To do this, it is necessary to cultivate a state of mind oriented towards wealth from an early age. Secondly, you must not be afraid to take risks to succeed. Indeed, people who become rich play to win, not to avoid losing. By telling yourself every day that you can do it, you will be able to cultivate a millionaire's state of mind. You will then be able to see opportunities where normal people see obstacles. This will maximize your chances of becoming rich in turn. ",

When you hang out with wealthy people you access to their ideas, network, and habits, and these are the three things that wealthy people use to become wealthy.Invest Time and Money in Developing Skills What makes people make money isn\u2019t how well they save, but how well they do things that other people need (or think they need). So by taking money that you earn and investing it in classes on coding, sales, trading, etc. you learn how to do a profitable skill better.

Houses seem like a smart investment but a lot of time their a money sink. You have to pay state taxes and they appreciate a lot slower than the market while also being a lot harder to liquidate. Also when you rent, if you lose a job you can just sublet and dip to a smaller joint until you get employed again, which is a lot less of a headache than worrying about your house getting foreclosed and having your credit take a dive. \u201cThe problem with owning a home is that when you need to sell you can\u2019t because it\u2019s usually during a recession and that\u2019s when no one is buying\u201d - James AltucherStay Away From Strip Clubs and McDonalds Strip clubs, binge drinking, fast food and drugs are all places where you will invest money but see close to no return.Now some people would argue that doing these things gives you an experience, which I would agree with, but after you experience these things a few time, that novelty becomes part of your identity, which makes it harder to kick, and a whole lot more expensive in the long term.I wrote a book called \u201cThe Power Bible\u201d click this link to find out more!

            "answer_text": "I will give you the secret that isn\u2019t really a secret. The key to becoming wealthy has nothing to do with how much money you make. That is why there are minimum wage millionaires out there and the majority of millionaires have never had an income as high as $100k per year. The secret to becoming wealthy is how you spend the money you make. It doesn\u2019t matter if you make $5 or $5000. If you want to be broke, spend that money on something consumable, like food, music or clothing. Broke people also spend on high price, low value items, like \u201cbling.\u201d If you want to be middle class, spend the money on something that has lasting but not permanent value. Think a home, furniture, vehicles. If you want to stay middle class forever, develop a real high FICO score and buy these things on credit. If you want to become rich, spend as little as possible on consumable goods and lasting but not permanent value goods. Spend as much of your money as possible on things that MAKE YOU MORE MONEY. Most experts say that 15% is the minimum, but the truly wealthy spend between 30% and 70%. The press and most that report on this get the relationship backwards. You will here them say that the wealthy are able to do this because they have a lot of disposable income. That is completely false. They have a lot of disposable income because they have sacrificed to buy things that make money. Some of them for decades. In the beginning you will only be able to stockpile money in savings. then maybe you can get some mutual funds or other simple investments. Finally you can get into real estate and all sorts of other exciting opportunities. You can also work 80 hours per week for 45 years and have a really nice home, car and furniture. Your answer to this simple question will tell if you will be rich in the future. Are you willing to drive a $1000 car or take the bus when you are only worth $10,000 (a car that is 10% of your worth), so that you can drive a $100,000 car when you are worth a $1 million (still 10% of your worth)? Many will answer \u201cYES,\u201d but actions speak louder than words. Broke people will get a $2000 car and rent $1000 rims to put on it. Middle class people will say, \u201cBut I need a reliable car,\u201d \u201cRepairs will cost too much,\u201d etc. and be stuck in a car loan or lease for most of their adult life. Future rich people will buy the car for $1000 or less. Sell it to a junkyard and get another when it can no longer be repaired. They will then use their money to buy things that make more money and pay cash for a $2000, $5000 and $10,000 used car as they can afford it. Most I have known never get to the $100,000 car. When you are worth $5 million, nobody, including yourself, cares that you drive an old Toyota, Chevy or Crown Victoria. ",

            "answer_text": "I got rich because I wanted to help my sister. I didn\u2019t want to be an entrepreneur. I knew nothing about business. I wanted to make a TV show. I was working at HBO and I pitched them the idea of a \u201cweb show\u201d called \u201cIII:am\u201d (3AM). The CEO said, \u201cgo for it\u201d. [This is the story of my first time, after many attempts, making real money. Summary of what I learned is at the end]. I started going out at three in the morning in NYC on Tuesday or Wednesday nights and interview everyone I ran into. Maybe I could say now it was \u201cthe first podcast\u201d. This was 1996\u20131998 that I did this. I interviewed prostitutes, drug dealers, homeless kids, mentally ill people who felt comfortable wandering the streets only at night. The experience changed my life. These people didn\u2019t fit in. Would never fit in.  Some were good people trapped in bad circumstances. Growing up abused in foster care systems. All of them had something in common. They couldn\u2019t live by the rules of nine to five. They found their energy, their life, outside when there were fewer rules, less judging, an upside down world, a world that almost seemed like a dream or a nightmare while everyone else was sleeping. I wanted to turn it into a TV show. I loved what I was doing. HBO gave me money to shoot it as a pilot. It was an adventure and in the middle of that adventure my sister called me: \u201cMichel needs help with his business. Can you look at what he\u2019s doing and maybe give him some advice?\u201d Sure. He was in the CD-ROM business. What? What\u2019s that? Back then, music was sold on CDs. Back in the dark ages. And then other things started being sold on CDs: games, books, information. This no longer exists. First DVDs, then the Internet replaced it. I started using the Internet in 1987. I started using the \u201cWorld Wide Web\u201d days after Tim Berners-Lee created the first web server. I was a programmer and learned how to make my own web server, my own search engine, my own websites. There were no tools to create websites. Everything had to be programmed from scratch. But I loved it. While I was trying to create a TV show I was also trying to write a novel. And when the web came along, it seemed like it would be this amazing new art medium: three dimensional novels, TV shows, and who knows what else. I wanted to be an artist on this medium. I was so excited that I became addicted. Maybe there were a few hundred websites at this time. I wish I could find the first website I made. It was a \u201chome page\u201d where I put stories I had written. Isolated pockets from all over the world started using this new medium. I was excited once when I got an email from Germany from someone who read one of the stories on my page and really enjoyed it. I kept up with all the new possibilities with the web. The browsers, the software, the possibilities as bandwidth on the network quickly increased. The first music I ever downloaded on the Internet was \u201cYesterday\u201d by the Beatles and it took over an hour to download. I took a job at HBO to get physically closer to the decision makers. The people who could say \u201cyes\u201d to a novel I wrote or \u201cyes\u201d to a TV show. I moved to NYC. This is where opportunities were. This is where money was. When I first walked to work I felt like I was living a famous life. Not that I was famous, but that somehow I had stepped into this incredible movie set that I had always dreamed of being a part of. My job was to help HBO set up \u201cinteractive TV\u201d across the cable lines. I was programming the remote control and also creating the software for the network that would ship HBO shows straight from a central service onto your TV screen. I said to my boss, \u201cwhy are we creating an entire network? Let\u2019s use the Web as out backbone since the software is already done for us.\u201d His name was Ken. Ken said, \u201cJames, settle down. The Internet might be good for academics but why don\u2019t you let the cable guys do what they are good at.\u201d Ok, ok. But I still kept obsessing on the Web. When I visited Michel, I told him about the Web and showed him what you can do. I said to him, everyone who is using the web now is obsessed with it. I showed him how to make a web page. How to use his design skills to make a page go from basic text (most pages were just text and links on a gray background with no images) to a beautiful page. I showed him how I used software to ad functionality, like a game or a quiz or a query or to take items from a database so that a page could be different every time you loaded it. I showed him so pages I had made, including HBO\u2019s intranet, maybe one of the first intranets created. After I programmed it and convinced HBO to start using it (everything from their movie database to putting the cafeteria menu online so employees could see) other divisions within Time Warner (which owned HBO) started asking for my help to build their intranets. I said to Michel, \u201cthis is going to replace CD-ROMs. You have to get good at this and start selling it to your clients.\u201d One day, a company approached us. They said they had a big client who needed a website. Well, they said, actually Arthur Anderson (the biggest accounting firm in the world then, and now out of business because of the Enron scandal) had a big client that needed a website: American Express. Arthur Anderson had no idea to build a website. Particularly a website that would have over 60,000 pages on it. The company they went to had no idea how to build a website. So they came to Michel, who came to me. I had $0 in my bank account. My HBO salary was $40,000 and I thought I was rich! My prior job had a $28,000 salary and I thought I was getting away with murder when HBO paid me $40,000. I don\u2019t know what American Express paid Arthur Anderson. I don\u2019t know what Arthur Anderson paid USI, the company that came to Michel. All I know is that Michel and I made $230,000 on AmericanExpress.com. At the same time we did another website for $35,000. I couldn\u2019t believe how much money I had all of a sudden. Michel and I decided to go into business together. HBO decided to do HBO.com. I was one of the people deciding who to hire to do the job. Three companies pitched us to do HBO.com. I picked the best company for the job! I hired Reset, Inc. The company Michel and I had started. We did HBO\u2019s website and all the websites for their shows. We also started doing websites for every division of Time Warner that had reached out to me, and we even did the website for Time Warner. Then other entertainment companies heard about us and heard about my III:am site. They loved the creativity. \u201cWe want that!\u201d they would say to us. So we did the websites for Bad Boy Records, Loud Records, Interscope, Miramax, October Films, New Line Cinema, and the websites for many movies, albums, artists. The website for the movie \u201cThe Matrix\u201d paid us $150,000. The website for \u201cScream 2\u201d we only charged $1,000. We just simply wanted to do it.  I was now making $60,000 a year at HBO and was working out of my cubicle during the day. At night I\u2019d go over to Reset, 20 blocks downtown, and work all night. Sometimes I\u2019d go in the conference room at HBO, lock the door, and make calls to clients during the day. I was scared of getting caught. But I didn\u2019t want to give up my job at HBO. I didn\u2019t enjoy business. I didn\u2019t like dealing with clients. I didn\u2019t like selling although it turned out this might have been the one business skill I was good at. I had such passion for the Web. I knew every customer of every company was going to use it. I would tell companies like JP Morgan that soon everybody would do all of their banking on the Web. I would tell Interscope records that soon everyone would be listening to music on the web. They laughed but they said, \u201cok, build us a website.\u201d In every meeting with a client, I would over promise. I would take what they wanted and then start suggesting more ideas but within the same price. \u201cYou can do that?\u201d they would always ask and I would say \u201cyes!\u201d even though I had no idea. But then we would do it. \u201cover promise and over deliver\u201d became my mantra. People ask me, \u201cDon\u2019t you mean \u201cunder promise\u2019?\u201d No, I don\u2019t! Why would I lie to customers? It\u2019s not impressive to under promise and over deliver. Its impressive to shock and awe them on every conversation. \u201cYes, I can do that and MORE!\u201d and \u201cHere is the site. We did what we said and MORE!\u201d I never lost a client that way. They always needed more and more websites. And they referred us to other websites. Because Michel and I had many of the skills (I was software, he was design), we didn\u2019t have to hire as many people so we also were able to charge less than the few competitors we had. Eventually, when we did hire employees, I couldn\u2019t believe it. This was an actual business! And people were doing my work for me! Which freed me up so I could find more customers. We were growing. And growing. During this time I made so many mistakes. I knew nothing at all about business. There is no such skill as \u201cBusiness\u201d. Business skill is really a collection of micro-skills: ideas, follow-through, sales, negotiation, execution, management, motivation, communicating vision, hiring well, psychology, and even a subtle skill such as \u201cbusiness valuation\u201d. I had \u201csales\u201d skill. I had \u201cideas\u201d and \u201ccommunicating vision\u201d. I had no follow thru skills. I was horrible at calling people back, even customers who were huge who were begging to hire us. We lost many opportunities that way. The worst is that I didn\u2019t understand how to value a business. Why did Yahoo buy an \u201cinternet calendar\u201d for ten million dollars? This seemed silly to me. I didn\u2019t understand why, RESET, which was profitable and had great clients, was valued less than a single piece of software that had no customers and was losing money.  Every day I wrote software that I could have made into products but I just used that software to provide services to our customers. I had no idea how to make my software into a product and then sell that product. I wrote software to easily make websites. I wrote software to create graphics on the fly. I wrote software so that everyone on a team could communicate with each other over the internet to keep track of tasks for that team. I wrote software so that everyone in the company could manage projects and keep track of sales by looking at pages on the web that were private to them. I wrote software to help companies set up e-commerce stores. But I just used that software to help me provide better services. I didn\u2019t realize that a service company was valued at a much less value than a software product company that could scale. I also didn\u2019t know anything about raising money or \u201cgoing public\u201d. Many people wanted to invest in us but I would say, \u201cwe don\u2019t need it. We\u2019re profitable.\u201d I didn\u2019t understand that many those investors could\u2019ve helped me figure out how to be a much more valuable company. Eventually I wanted to sell the company. I hated the clients. All of them. I hated selling. I hated asking them for money. And I hated doing their websites. For fun, Michel and I would make our own websites and part of our sales pitch was showing them sites we made. They would always say, \u201cWe want that!\u201d And I also hated being poor. I was making money but we were also using money to pour back into the business. And after 18 months of juggling both HBO and RESET, I jumped ship to work fulltime at my own company. By that point, we had about 20 employees and were on track to do three million in revenues. But I had never wanted to take the risk of leaving HBO. Being an entrepreneur seemed too risky! And it was. Every day a client threatens to leave, or drops a project that you thought would\u2019ve made a lot of money. Every day I had to sell. I was the only salesman for the company and I was the CEO and the programmer. And you can\u2019t leave the work at the office. It was 24 hours of worry. I\u2019d stay up at night wondering how I was going to pay people if clients left. I was sick with worry all of the time. I spent a lot of time trying to get a bigger company to buy us. I met with everyone. They always asked, \u201cwhy do you want to sell?\u201d The answer, to me, was obvious, I wanted money! But I couldn\u2019t say that. Theres always a good reason and a real reason. The real reason was I wanted to be rich. The good reason was what I gave, \u201cwe are expanding so fast that I want a partner so we can keep achieving bigger and better.\u201d We got several offers. When you get an offer for a company its rarely, \u201chere\u2019s $5 million in cash and now we own your company.\u201d So I had to learn the skills of structuring a deal. A deal will usually look like: part cash, part stock, part \u201cearn-out\u201d. So you are tied to the company who buys you via the stock you own, plus your ability to grow it (and so the earn-out would kick in and give you more money over time). I am skipping a lot of the story. The time we tried to start a record label. Or a tea company. Because we felt we should diversify. Or the time one of our competitors threw a chair at me when we ran into them at a restaurant (which was the first of two times that a competitor threw a chair at me). Or the time we [well known rap group] visit us and pull out their guns while checking out how we were doing with their website. Or the many many times that people at companies would ask us for bribes if they threw the business to us. Many, many stories while my brother in law and I simply just tried to wing \u201cbusiness\u201d as best we could. We had no idea what we were doing. And, we didn\u2019t even know what we didn\u2019t even know. And I was scared all the time. Finally, someone made us an offer that looked good. We took it. And the worst period was that while I had been busy selling the company, I hadn\u2019t been focused on getting new clients. That\u2019s ok, I thought. Because once we got an offer to sell the company I figured the deal would close fast and I would have money. MONEY! The lawyers would always say, \u201cnext week\u201d, when we would ask when the deal would close. But next week turned into next week turned into next month. I couldn\u2019t tell if the buyer was getting nervous (\u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse\u201d) or if this was normal. But I really wanted to go from almost no money in my bank account to millions and I was getting terrified it wouldn\u2019t happen. And meanwhile we were losing customers. My eye was off the ball. I just didn\u2019t know what to do. And we didn\u2019t really have anybody at an executive level that could help me. We had never hired for that because we were cheap and always wanted to have the cheapest services so that people would hire us. Finally, the deal closed . Seven months after we got the offer. Millions of dollars were wired into my bank account. Oh my god I was so happy. I had totally cashed out. I was rich. Two years later I had $143 in my bank account and lost my home. But that\u2019s another story.  Summary: I had to go from zero to rich several times. I was always making money, going broke, starting from scratch, and making it again. Each time I succeeded was because of the following: have a vision for the future that is unique. If you aren\u2019t the only one in the room, you\u2019re in the wrong room.be able to sell that vision: why it\u2019s unique, why the customer will benefit, why you are the best qualified to execute for the customer, what is the concrete value of what you are selling?Microskills: build the skills needed to be a part of that vision so that the future doesn\u2019t leave you behind. Software skills, or writing skills, or negotiating skills, etc.Spoke and Wheel rule: share that vision with everyone. Create projects just for you that others can see. Build a network of people who want to hear your vision and participate in it. You can do this by writing articles, building a website, offering free services, participating in social media groups, etc.Use the above to get customers.Give your customers new ideas every day. Write down 10 ideas a day to keep the \u201ccreativity muscle\u201d exercised.Customer rule #1: \u201ctouch\u201d your customer every day for at least the first 100 days they are a customer.Customer rule #2: your best new customers are your old customers.Customer rule #3: 16 touches. To get a customer, you have to communicate with them, on average, 16 times. Share ideas, make introductions, go to dinner, go to a charity event with them, help them out for free - each one of those is a single touch.Surround yourself with good people. Without a good partner, you are dead. Without good customers, you are dead. Without good people to help you execute, you are dead. Without good friends, you are dead. You can\u2019t make money if you are arguing with spouses, friends, employees, customers every day.Stay healthy. You can\u2019t build your business if you are sick.Turn services into products. For example: if you like giving investment advice, figure out how to automate that or scale that to large numbers of people. The dream is to scale. Valuation is when you sell that dream.Sell the business as soon you can. Particularly your first business. This way you have money and can relax a bit when you start your second, hopefully bigger, business.There are three skills to money: making it, keeping it, growing it. When you \u201cmake it\u201d, make sure you learn how to \u201cKeep it\u201d before you try to \u201cgrow it\u201d. If you skip that part you WILL go broke.Finally, read real stories like the one I just told. There\u2019s too many people talking about \u201cUber\u201d and not enough talking about real business. Real business is about reducing risk. Not taking risks. Real business is about providing value. Not smoke-and-mirrors value. Real business is about relationships. Not about money. Real business is ugly and dirty. Real business has problems every day. The highs and the lows are brutal. Don\u2019t believe specific tactics (like \u201cbuy on Etsy and sell on Amazon\u201d). Every business carves it\u2019s own path. Study all the paths. Come up with ten ideas a day to begin exercising your \u201cidea muscle\u201d. Then you come up with something unique. Something that is YOU and nobody else. Stay healthy, exercise creativity every day, have good people around you, don\u2019t try to control things that are out of your control. That\u2019s how you get rich. ",

            "answer_text": "By NOT saving money! Savers are losers in this economy! Let me explain: The rules of money were changed in 1971 when President Nixon broke the Bretton Woods agreement.This is what took the U.S. dollar off the gold standard!The rules of money changed as the U.S. dollar stopped being money (backed up by gold) and became an instrument of debt.After 1971, savers became losers!Here\u2019s the depressing truth: Millions of people still believe that wealth is created by saving money. Millions try to cut back on their expenses to save money, while the federal government prints trillions of dollars, which destroys the purchasing power of your savings!This is how it works: Have you heard of Quantitative Easing? What about QE1, QE2, QE3?  When Central Banks create money out of thin air they call it \u201cquantitative easing.\u201d Why call it quantitative easing? It\u2019s simply a cover-up name to \u201cprinting money.\u201d It sounds more complex and interesting. It's a fantastic way to deceive millions of people who will try to work harder and save even more while this brings terrible inflationary effects to the economy. Luckily the quantitative easing has temporarily stopped, but the result is this:  Your purchase power decreases as time goes by\u2026 and it's still falling fast! But\u2026 I have \u201cmillions\u201d saved!Good for you!Better start investing your money on ASSETS!But\u2026 I\u2019m making compounding interest on my investments!That\u2019s not good enough!Are your compounding interest investments helping you feel more financially safe or not? Most likely not!To answer your question: You need to invest in assets to protect your wealth from the inflationary effects on your money! Assets that keep their intrinsic value over time like Real Estate. A car is NOT an asset because it depreciates over time\u2026 unless its a 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO, which sold for a record $34.65 million! How is money made in the Information Age?

            "answer_text": "According to me, being rich begins in your mind \u2014 not in your pocket. To get rich, you have to believe that something so extremely far away from your reach, with a little hard work and determination, is actually possible. Several people aspire to break bad habits but habits can impact your performance and productivity. Actually, it is habits, that separate the rich from the poor. That\u2019s why I would share 8 good habits that will help you become rich in life. Spend judiciously: Wealthy people prevent over-expenditure by rewarding their future selves first. Nearly all of those who struggle financially are living beyond their means. They spend more than they earn, and their debt is daunting. If you want to put an end to your financial problems, you need to make a habit of saving, investing, and budgeting what you spend. Must Read: Rishabh Surana's answer to What are effective ways of saving money as a student?Challenge yourself : If you want to get rich, then you should surround yourself with people who question your beliefs. Being surrounded by people, who don't confirm your perceptions of life will inspire you to think outside the box. Hence the famous saying \"birds of the same feather flock together\".Read every day : Learning information that will improve your awareness of your industry or profession will make you more important to friends, customers, or clients. Most rich people read 30 minutes or more every day.Monitor your emotions : Not every thought has to come out of your mouth. Not every emotion has to be expressed. If you say something in your mind, you risk offending someone. You need to realize that allowing your emotions to dominate them will ruin relationships at work and at home. Wait to say what\u2019s on your mind until you are calm and have had time to look carefully at the situation.Talk Less and listen more : Wealthy people are good communicators, and they're good listeners. I realize that you can learn and teach yourself only by listening to what other people have to say. Just as the ratio of ears and mouth is 2:1, you should hear more and then talk only after you are confident enough to confront!Impossible is possible : I agree there are things that are really impossible but becoming rich isn\u2019t impossible. Some dreams do come true when you work for it. Talk to yourself each and every day with full zeal and zest and compel your mind to get convinced. When your dictionary is full of affirmative words, there is no way to look back. Wealth will knock your doors automatically.Live in the future : \u201cI am living in the future, so the present is my past.\u201d \u2013 Kanye West. Those who have made or who make a lot of money are not prophets who predict the future; they are ordinary people like you. They give an attempt to look into the future on a regular basis. I know of a man who demonstrated this so perfectly and we all are aware of Steve Jobs the apple guy. Steve seemed to know what people would want even before they knew they would want it.Networking is Important : You'll create meaningful connections that can lead to more sales, or help you get a better job if you spend time pressing your flesh and giving back to your community. Must Read: Rishabh Surana's answer to Why should you meet as much people as possible?A wise man once said, \u201cSomeone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.\u201d So you want a better tomorrow or accumulate wealth then change your habits now. Visualize your dreams and start working for them with a positive attitude.  ",

            "answer_text": "This is Charles M. Schwab.  Charles Schwab was an American Industrialist and a manager in the beginning of 20th century. He was one of the first person in America who was paid annual salary over one million dollars. That time in America there were no taxes. A person who was earning 50 dollars a week was considered as well off. Andrew Carnegie selected Charles Schwab to become the first president of a Steel Company in 1921. This steel company was newly formed, and its name was United States Steel Company. At that time, Charles Schwab was only thirty-eight years old.  As soon Charles Schwab joined United States Steel Mills, he turned it into a profitable business. And later, he took over a troubled Bethlehem Steel Company and transformed it into one of the most profitable and successful companies in the United States. How Charles Schwab did it? What was that ability for which Andrew Carnegie hired Charles Schwab and paid him over 1 million dollar? Was Charles Schwab a genius? No. Was Charles Schwab a technical expert in the manufacture of Steel? No. There were many engineers who had far more expertise than Charles Schwab. However, the sole reason was that Charles Schwab had an admirable ability to arouse enthusiasm in the people. Charles Schwab himself told the reason of his success, a question which people frequently used to ask him with a lot of curiosity. Below golden words of Charles Schwab need to be written on the walls of our homes, in the notepads of our mobiles, in the computers of our offices and most importantly in our brains. \u201cI consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people the greatest asset I possess. And the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement\u201d. \u201cThere is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticisms from superiors. I never criticize anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise, but loath to find fault. If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise. This is what Charles Schwab said and this is what was his practice in his life.  But, what we do in our life. In fact, we do exactly the opposite. In our office, if we don\u2019t like the work of our subordinates we severely criticize them for their incompetency. We directly say that you are wrong. We threat them of not giving good appraisal and even sometimes we threat them of terminating from the job. In our homes, we criticize our kids for not doing their homework. We criticize them for not sleeping on time. We criticize them for always keep asking for toys. This criticism creates a stressed atmosphere around us and drops our enthusiasm to put more effort in our works. On the other hand, when we appreciate people, science tells us that this appreciation releases a chemical in their brains called as dopamine. This dopamine makes people more energetic and active. Ultimately our appreciation enhances people\u2019s capacity to do more work with greater energy. So those who were previously not giving any useful input, get more involved in their work.  So let\u2019s decide today! We will not criticize people for their wrongs. We will not insult them for their bad behaviors. We will not use negative language with them. Instead, We will appreciate people. We will give them a sincere guidance that is without any greed or lust. This is a best kept secret for any kind of success. (This event was given as an example by Dale Carnegie in his book How to Win Friends and Influence People) ",

            "answer_text": "After three years of work, my friend at work told me he had saved $20,000. He told me it happens automatically into his savings from his paycheck. I looked at my statements and there were hundreds of dollars unaccounted for last month, no doubt spent on \u201cwomen, wine and song\u201d. I started doing what he was doing. Save when you are young to get the benefit of compounding. What Is Compound Interest? -- The Motley Fool I have always kept a fund called a fu*k you fund where I could leave a company if I so desired and go to another. Keep a budget, many templates online. Know your expenses. Have 6 months in expenses saved away and do not break the glass unless an emergency. Develop a written financial plan. Save, save, save. Try to devote no more than 28 - 33 percent of your gross monthly income to your mortgage or rent - some experts even suggest 25 percent. Another way to look at it is that your home should cost roughly no more than four times your annual income. In terms of prioritizing a budget, it's never too early to save for the future. Start with retirement savings, then credit card debt, and then your emergency fund. Allocate 10 percent of your income to savings. When it comes to discretionary spending, plan to save 10 percent for the basics, 15 percent for comfort, and around 20 percent to escape. After your mortgage or rent, that leaves roughly 12 - 20 percent for the rest of your household needs, perhaps more if you're frugal. In the past, a rule of thumb was to set aside three months of expenses in an emergency fund. In this economic climate, consider planning for six months. Include your mortgage, car payments and groceries. If the figure is large, think about opening a money market account to earn interest. If you're just starting out, try to save 10 percent of your income. If this is difficult, start small and build toward your goals: set up a direct deposit with your employer, and direct $10, $25 or $50 into your savings instead of your checking. This can add up quickly! If you are farther along in your career, include investment goals in your savings strategy. Don't overlook the small stuff for potential savings. Every dollar counts. Whether it's packing a lunch instead of eating out, opting for a regular coffee instead of a pricey specialty drink, or using your cell phone as your primary telephone, there are many ways to better budget your money. Keep a record of expenses to help identify wasteful spending and opportunities to cut back. This leads to the level of accountability you'll need if you're serious about saving for the future Live below your means. Power is not getting what you want; it is wanting what you have Lay off the credit. Invest in ways that work for you. Get professional advice. Get a 15 year mortgage not a 30 year Don\u2019t miss out on being a parent All material objects fade and rust, no matter how they glitter. You don\u2019t need money to happy forever. Success is not getting what you want, it\u2019s being happy with what you have. I will say that money buys security. Figure out what your monthly expenses really are and multiply that out by your life expectancy online that is a total you will need for the rest of your life. It does not have to be much just enough. There are some big-ticket items, as you grow older. Education for the children, health insurance and long-term disability care when you were in a nursing home. INVESTMENTS There are two kinds of investors- those who like to eat well and those who like to sleep well. :) Invest in mutual funds that have 1000 stocks Add to the fund automatically Never touch it, do not time the market. When the market is down keep buying. When you are 50, put 1/3 in bonds. Remember this- You will run out of time before you run out of money. ",

            "answer_text": "Most people, if not all of us, want to live in financial comfort and stability. We want to be rich, to be able to buy anything we want, and to have access to a premium lifestyle. While the end goal is clear, it\u2019s hard to know where to begin your journey to being wealthy. Before you get started, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that becoming rich takes time and effort. There are very few ways to instantly have large amounts of wealth, and all of them are luck-based. Not all of us can win the lottery or inherit a fortune from a mysterious rich relative. Becoming rich in most cases involves a lot of hard work, patience, and time. There are some tried-and-true things you can do that can help you get rich, but the key is to constantly and consistently work hard, keep track of your personal finances, and keep your eyes on the prize. 1. Add Value Something many self-made wealthy people have in common is that they are valuable in specific ways. Even when millionaires and billionaires are taken out of the equation, many rich people \u2014 doctors, engineers, filmmakers \u2014 have gotten rich after adding value to themselves and then adding value to the world. For example, a rich neurosurgeon may be specially talented and skilled. This surgeon added value to the world after improving their own skills and quality of life. Adding value to yourself is a good foundation to begin your journey to being rich. Develop some knowledge or skills that justify someone paying you a good amount of money. Convince people that you are worth a large paycheck because you will add value to their lives in return. 2. Tax Yourself  The concept of saving money is not a new one. However, it is extremely easy to \u201cdip into your savings\u201d when you want something badly enough. The key to accomplishing your goal of amassing wealth is to actually try and save money. A different way of looking at your savings is to view them as taxes. Once you pay your taxes, you never get the whole amount back. Treat your savings the same way. Set money aside in a savings account or transfer it to a totally separate account where you cannot touch it. Treat your savings like money that you will never get back, until the day that you get it all back at once. 3. Create a Plan and Follow It  The likelihood of suddenly stumbling upon unlimited riches is extremely low. While it may seem that a lot of the success stories you hear are luck-based, this is actually not true. There is probably some chance and luck involved, but most rich people became rich through meticulous planning and discipline. This includes things like budgets and timelines, as well as a plan of what to do at every step of the way to success. It is important not to get complacent and do your best to keep going, and having a plan helps without wasting unnecessary amounts of time. Creating a budget and following it is only one part of this process. 4. Invest The core principle behind investing is that you end up making more money than you spent. However, it is important to choose your investments wisely. There are plenty of places for you to sink your money into, but figuring out which one of these will result in you profiting is difficult. Real estate is sometimes a good investment, but it is expensive. Investing in the stock market does not have to be expensive, but it can be risky and unstable. A 401K is a wise investment that you should invest in, but it can depend on how well the business you work for is doing. There are plenty of factors to consider when investing, so make sure you think about it rationally. Talk to experts or friends who are experienced in investing before making a decision. 5. Start a Business This is much easier said than done, but the last four steps lay the groundwork to be able to start your own business. If you have a knack for business or want to be your own boss, this can be a great step to making some money. However, as many entrepreneurs will tell you, creating your own business requires massive upfront costs and low revenue in the beginning. Being an entrepreneur is not a quick way to get rich \u2014 it is a massive change in lifestyle. It has its unique trials and rewards, and in many cases is totally worth it. However, this is not a choice to be taken lightly. It requires commitment, grit, and some luck to be successful. While it may take some time, it can certainly help you get wealthy. 6. Be Grateful Becoming rich does not only require external factors to fall into place \u2014 many personality factors have to align for you to succeed at whatever venture you\u2019ve started. Staying humble and grateful for the progress you\u2019ve made at every step of the way is essential. People do not want to give their money to someone who does not appear to appreciate it, or gets too carried away with any moderate amount of success. Keeping your life in perspective and having a considerate, thankful, and humble attitude is the way to go. 7. Develop Patience  Another important personality trait to being successful and rich is patience. Nothing big is accomplished overnight, and you cannot and will not get rich in a matter of days. All the efforts you put towards accumulating wealth could take months or even years to pay off. It\u2019s easy to get frustrated early on, especially when it seems like there\u2019s a new wealthy person in the news every other day. However, realizing that your pace of success does not have to compete with theirs is crucial. In the long run, patience can be extremely rewarding. This does not mean that you should get complacent or wait things out instead of taking risks. Success can take some time, and getting frustrated is detrimental to your efforts. 8. Educate Yourself  It is key to try and educate yourself, not only in your chosen field but also in the ways of the world. Keeping up with the news, for example, is extremely important if you want to make a decision about investing or find out about upcoming trends. Ignorance is the prime killer of any efforts to make money. This means you have to constantly educate yourself. You cannot let major events or trends slide, because in each of them there is a threat or opportunity for you. Staying aware and educating yourself about current events is essential. 9. Take Calculated Risks There is no money made without a risk taken. Whether it\u2019s starting a business or investing in stocks, every avenue to making money requires some risk. Even selling your old furniture requires you taking the risk that the buyer will show up and will pay you. It is a comparatively small risk when compared to deciding whether to spend millions of dollars on a new product line, but it is still a risk. In order to make money, you have to take a chance that a venture or idea you have will pan out. Therefore, it is important to think deeply and evaluate multiple possible outcomes before you decide that an investment is worth it. Taking risks without thinking about them beforehand is an incredibly quick way to lose money. To earn, you should take risks, but they should be calculated. 10. Give Back  It is important to give back to the community. This leads back to the first point about adding value to the world around you. If you earn some money, give some back to a cause you believe in. This way, you are adding value to the world after having added value to yourself. Another benefit of giving to charity is that people perceive you as a better person when you give to causes they care about. They are likely to trust you more when they see that you aren\u2019t intent on hoarding the money they give you, and that doing so will benefit their community in turn. Of course, the tax benefits of giving to charity are also a great incentive to do so. Being rich means something different to every individual. Some people are happy with a decent-sized home and a moderate-income job, while others want to be millionaires and billionaires. Regardless of where you feel you fall on the spectrum, these steps can help you achieve the level of wealth you want. Before you get started, though, make sure to sort out your current finances so your bank account is ready to expand. ",

            "answer_text": " Meet Gary Dahl, The guy who invented of the Pet Rock.[1] Gary proved that you don\u2019t need to be a rocket scientist to get rich. What you do need to do is think different than the majority of people. That\u2019s what Gary Dahl did, and it made him very successful. Gary Dahl sold rocks. But not just any rocks, he sold Pet Rocks. He marketed the Pet Rock to parents as a solution to one of their biggest problems \u2013 a nagging child who keeps asking for a pet. The Pet Rock is cheap, it\u2019s a pet, and the best part? You don\u2019t have to clean up any poop. The craze around this \u201ctoy\u201d was high up there, alongside the Hula Hoop and Slinky, though it\u2019s production was much more, well, simple. For about $4, you can buy a simple, oval rock in a box, with the idea that you present this rock to your child as a pet. In 1975, over a million customers did just that (remember there were no social media at that time) \u2013 and he proved, once and for all, that good marketing really can sell anything. He sold the Pet Rocks for $3.95 and walked away with $15,000,000 (that\u2019s not a typo, he really made $15 million).  So how did Gary Dahl do it \u2013 and what can we learn from his success? Gary Dahl, who passed away in 2015, got his start as an advertising copywriter, which doesn\u2019t really come as a surprise. The idea behind the Pet Rock supposedly started as a joke, inspired by the popular children\u2019s story, Stone Soup. The idea was dreamt up over a few alcoholic beverages in Northern California, during which he listened to other patrons complain about how difficult pets were to take care of. Legend has it that Dahl imagined that the Pet Rock was a \u201cpackaged sense of humor,\u201d according to an interview with People he gave that same year. Whether it was the appeal of a fantasy pet, or it was simply for humor, the new toy made him very wealthy, very quickly. WE JUDGE BOOKS BY THEIR COVERS This is the most obvious point we can all learn from the Pet Rock. The reason why the product flourished, despite the fact that it was just an ordinary stone you could find in your backyard or in the park, was that it was packaged and marketed perfectly. It came in a small container with air holes, similar to the ones that real pets might come in from the pet shop. The rock itself was laid in a nest of hay, making it look like an egg. And it even came with a detailed care guide with instructions on how to care for the rock \u2013 which was a genius stroke of cynical humor. We\u2019ve all heard the popular saying, \u201cdon\u2019t judge a book by its cover.\u201d If we actually listened to that advice, authors wouldn\u2019t bother paying designers thousands of dollars (and sometimes tens of thousands of dollars) to make their book covers beautifully. Your packaging tells the customer what their buying, but it can also be part of the product \u2013 and experience \u2013 itself. SELL AN EMOTION, NOT JUST A PRODUCT The Pet Rock catered to customers in the 1970s, who were feeling restless, bored, and cynical. Remember, this was the time that not only the Pet Rock became popular, but also Magic 8-Balls and mood rings. The most popular movies were about mental hospitals abusing patients (One Flew Over The Cuckoo\u2019s Nest) and sharks eating tourists (Jaws). There was an aura of disillusionment throughout. Dahl knew that people were unhappy and looking for escapism, and his product hit at just the right moment. Sometimes it\u2019s not a product that the consumer wants, it\u2019s a mental state they\u2019re after. Whether it\u2019s to laugh, fantasize, feel safe, or feel smart or powerful, cater to that. If Gary Dahl can be successful by selling rocks, you can do it too. So what are you waiting for? Footnotes[1] How Gary Dahl Became A Millionaire By Selling Rocks - Minority Mindset",

But over the last few years I have developed a ridiculously simple new strategy. I haven't got a name for it, so I'll call it the 'Do I really need it' strategy. It goes something like this:I wanted the new iPhone 5 when it came out, but I didn't need it.So I bought the stock instead. I wanted the iPhone 6 when it came out, but my iPhone 4 still worked great.So once again, I bought the stock. I wanted to save for a Tesla, or at least buy one on lease.I didn't really need a Tesla, I use public transport for all my travels without a hitch.So I bought the stock instead. When Netflix came out a few years ago, I thought 'Netflix is super cool! But I never have time to watch TV.'So I bought some stock instead. I've repeated this with quite a few big potential purchases.Obviously I do a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the underlying businesses before I purchase the stock. If I didn't understand the underlying business or it didn't fit my criteria, I'd usually just buy SPY or something instead.It's actually been quite an eye opener, realising that we're made to believe we need so many things when in reality, we don't. And even better, all these items I would have bought would have depreciated and lost value.My life is no worse off for not having them, and in fact, I'm much wealthier.The returns from my alternative investing method have been far greater than I ever could have imaged.

            "answer_text": "Anyone can become rich, but not everyone does. For starters, \u201crich\u201d depends on a host of factors. If you\u2019re earning $100,000/year in Atlanta, GA, then you\u2019re doing pretty well. If you\u2019re earning $100,000/year in San Francisco or NYC, however, then you might be having trouble even paying the rent. You\u2019re probably living with roommates. Living in an area you can afford improves your chances of ending up rich. If you had been living in the year 1900, then $100,000/year meant you were almost living like a king or queen. That amount is only somewhat above average in 2019, thanks to inflation. Inflation grows as the global economy grows, meaning that it\u2019s unavoidable unless an economy quits growing (unlikely). That\u2019s why, when wages fail to keep up with inflation, it becomes a serious problem. Your income can\u2019t buy as much as it used to. That means you must earn more and more income over time to overcome inflation and improve your chances of becoming rich since inflation erodes your income. If you\u2019re earning $500,000/year from one stream of income such as a job, then while you\u2019re making a fair bit, your income comes from one income source. Lose that income source, and your income falls right down to $0. On the other hand, if you\u2019re making $100,000/year at a job, but you have other income streams that pay you $50,000/year, $1 million/year, $400,000/year, $7 million/year, and so on, then you\u2019re doing much better financially than in the other scenario. If you lose one income source, at least the others are still making bank for you. That\u2019s how a guy like Warren Buffet can be a multi-billionaire, despite \u201conly\u201d earning $100,000/year as the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. Owning income-producing assets can really boost your chances of becoming rich. Examples include: Copyrights (ownership of intellectual property like artwork, a book series, a movie series, a media franchise)Business or series of businesses (restaurant chain, chain of spas, chain of computer hardware stores, etc)Real estate (multi-family properties, single-family properties, land, etc)Savings account,Retirement accountPatents on an inventionLoansShares in a companyBonds in a company, country, etcThe point is, many things dictate whether someone becomes rich or not. Those things include living costs, inflation, the income-producing assets that you own, and other things. Anyone can become rich, but not everyone does due to a lack of control over and understanding of these factors. Chasing money isn\u2019t the way to become rich. Understanding and taking advantage of things like income-producing assets, the cost of living, and inflation are the ways to become rich. It\u2019s easier said than done. That\u2019s my two cents, anyway. ",

            "answer_text": "Six secrets to know to become a millionaire  Many millionaires now live in the middle class, work full time and shop in discount stores like everyone else. Wondering how rich they became? These are the six secrets to know to become a millionaire. The secrets of millionaires To make a fortune, it is not as sorcerer as it seems. 1. Concentrate on your goal to become a millionaire Wanting to be rich is condition number 1. \"The biggest obstacle to wealth is fear,\" says T. Harv Eker, author of Secrets of the Millionaire Mind. People are afraid to think big, but if you see little, you will only realize small things. \" 2. Make your education to enrich yourself To make money, you need to know as much as you can about finance. Read books and magazines about money management and investing. Ask everyone who knows about it to explain how it works and start applying what you learn: living below your means, not making impulsive purchases, always trying to negotiate better prices (on cars , cable bills, supplies, etc.), stay in one's home even if one has long been able to afford a more expensive one, and invest 20% of one's annual income.  3. Passion, it pays According to research by Thomas J. Stanley, author of The Millionaire Mind, over 80% of millionaires say they would never have succeeded if their main occupation had not been something that was close to their heart. So, if you want to get rich, and even if it's not always easy, focus on your passion rather than the paycheck. 4. Make your money work and become a millionaire Put money aside for the sole purpose of investing in something that pays off, whether it's in your retirement fund, in a particular business or in real estate. The most important thing is that this money pays you back. This means that you have to place it where it will work hard for your own profit before using it for another purpose, like offering you the latest flat screen TV model. 5. Know, future millionaires, that there is often no glory without risk! To make a fortune also requires taking risks. At age 29, Dave Lindahl opened a landscaping business by purchasing all equipment on credit. When things went down in the winter, he took home renovation contracts. After a few contracts, he thought he'd better buy houses and sell them for profit. He took the risk and bought a first house. With the profits, he bought another, then another. Today, Lindahl owns more than $ 143 million worth of rental properties in eight US states. 6. The ultimate secret to becoming a millionaire? Stop spending! There is no chance ... According to the 2007 US wealth survey, some of the wealthiest 'spend their money as the middle class'. They cut out coupons, wait for sales and buy luxury items when there is a discount. If you want to become a millionaire, cut into unnecessary spending and focus on setting the conditions that will lead you to fortune. ",

            "answer_text": "Work hard. Don't pass on lucrative opportunities. Take risks, but get lucky by having the risks you take work out rather than imploding on you. Be in the right place at the right time to be able to take advantage of opportunities. Invest your money wisely. Delay gratification in order to invest in your future. Almost every single person used as an example by the other answers worked hard, took advantage of opportunities, wisely invested, didn't give up after failing. And they were all in the right place at the right time and were lucky enough to have their risk taking pan out. That's why there's a lot of people posting about other rich people, quoting them, but most of these plebs aren't themselves rich despite taking the advice. This isn't a Disney movie. Time for everyone to grow the fuck up. There's a finite amount of opportunity out there. Not all of you will have those doors open for you even if you all followed the advice. That's a fantasy. You can not completely control the luck component: being in the right place at the right time, having your risks pan out. All you can control is being prepared if and when the opportunity does arrive. You can control your investing, you work ethic, your networking, etc. But, don't any of you fucks delude yourselves. There is a chance component to all of this whether you like to admit it or not. Bill Gates happened to have been surrounded by the right people who helped him along and an environment that afforded him opportunities other people didn't. Read about his early life if you don't know what I'm talking about. Zuckerberg also was surrounded by some very smart, hard working people that did a lot of the heavy lifting in making Facebook. Those are variables neither Bill, nor Zuck had full control over. However, both of these guys took full advantage of those opportunities when they present themselves. That's all you can do. That's all I'd tell you. I'm not going to blow lofty smoke up your ass. ",

            "answer_text": "How to Get Rich: 11 Bold Moves That Guarantee Wealth Everyone has dreams about winning the lottery and getting crazy rich overnight. People want to get rich. Just do a search on Google Books and you can see that it\u2019s been a rising trend since the 90s.  Many people are looking for ways to get their first 100K, or ways to invest for a better retirement. Some are trying to succeed as entrepreneurs. People want to have enough money to buy beautiful homes, powerful cars, and great vacations. But not many know what getting rich really means and what it takes. Being rich is more than about the dollar amount. Being rich is a state of mind. In a sense, you could be rich but still poor, and vice versa. You can define \u201crich\u201d in different ways. There are a lot of people who simply consider it as having a lot of money. For them, rich is equivalent to a being a millionaire. But rich can also be psychological richness. It is an achievement of being able to live without the worry of money. You don\u2019t necessarily need to own a castle to be considered rich. Everyone can be rich as long as we are able to do what we desire freely and to have the fulfillment in life. The key of it is to live with or even less than what you have. To be \u201cnormal\u201d even when you are financially capable to do a lot more. You might have your own preference on which definition suits you better, but here are some ways on how to get rich. It may help you achieve either (or both) of them. If you want to become really really rich, make bold moves. It\u2019s an ambitious goal to become a very rich person, and if you\u2019re aiming for that, do something big, and make some great changes in life. 1. Exploit your skill as a self-employed expert and invest in it. Make it your goal to do one thing better than anyone: Work on it, train it, learn it, practice, evaluate and refine it. You may find most sports-players or entertainers are millionaires, and that is because they are utilizing their skills fully. If there\u2019s something you\u2019re good at, it is likely you can reap considerable rewards out of it. It is the same concept of being the top of a particular field. When you are the best at something, you find that opportunities come to you. To become an expert of something, it is crucial to never stop improving. Successful people invest time, energy, and money in improving themselves, and it might just be the most rewarding investment you can ever make. To get started, figure out what skill you want to cultivate. Make a list of the world\u2019s ten best people at that one thing, and use this list to define criteria and track your own progress toward becoming the best. If you\u2019re a writer, for example, you might consult the New York Times Bestseller list, and identify the ten successful authors that you admire the most. Learn more about these writers, what they did to be successful, and read some of their work. Invest the time and energy in improving your own craft, by looking at successful past models. 2. Hit $100K, then invest the rest. Everyone wants to be a millionaire. But a goal like this isn\u2019t something you can easily achieve in a short period of time. Aim at saving $100K first. The small amounts you save daily is powerful. You might only be able to put away $5 or $10 at a time, but each of these investments are your financial foundation. 3. Be an inventor and consider it as an opportunity to serve. Stop thinking about making a lot of money and start thinking about serving a lot of people. If you think about what people need, or things that could improve society, your insights will have more impact. Not only that, you could be the first to produce a trending product in the future. When you start to serve a lot of people, the effect of word of mouth is magnified \u2013 not to mention, you\u2019ll have much more helpful feedback to improve what you do. Having the patent of a popular invention could be the fast-lane ticket to prosper. Just look at Snap-chat. It would definitely be challenging, but consider it to be a way of serving, to benefit those who actually need your invention. No business is successful without the support of the public. Rather than squeezing every single dollar out of your customers, show them you are actually working to make them better. 4. Join a start-up and get stock. Using the same potential consideration of start-up in the above points, owning stocks of one or more start-up companies could be a valuable investment if the company thrives and either floats or is sold to a larger enterprise. Only a small minority of start-ups succeed in realizing large capital gains, so the odds are not good. However, you can use your judgement to see which business idea and which management team are likely to succeed. Early employees in Apple, Google and Microsoft became millionaires on this basis. 5. Develop property. Buying, developing and selling property has always been a major way for people to accumulate capital. Borrowing could be a key element in this method. Say you borrow $200,000 and put in $50,000 of your own to buy a property for $250,000. Then you develop the property and sell it for $400,000. The property has increased in value by 60% but your $50,000 has now grown fourfold to $200,000. You have to select the right properties in the right areas and develop them wisely. You are at risk from booms and busts in the property market. However, in the long term this remains a proven way to accumulate wealth. 6. Build a portfolio of stocks and shares. If you can make steady investments in stocks over a long period, choose wisely and reinvest the dividends then you can build a large store of wealth. Of course stocks can go either way and many small investors lose heart when their portfolio plunges. But over the long-term, equities are as good an investment as property and much more liquid. Stock market crashes represent great buying opportunities for those with cash and strong nerves. 7. Start your own business and eventually sell it More and more startup have seen success with great return in recent years. If you can find a new approach towards a specific corner of the market and build a business that addresses that need, then you have a potential of success in it. It literally can be anything: a cleaning business, a food delivery service, or a blog. It will probably take years of very hard work to build up the enterprise. All entrepreneurs will have to endure great risk and stress. But if you can pull it off, the potential rewards are huge. This is how many of the seriously wealthy people did it. If you want to become wealthier and live a better life, build simple habits. If you\u2019re aiming for a stable life with enough money to support a living, start with the everyday things you can do. 8. Find a job in the right vehicle. Choose a job of your interest \u2013 do what you love and love what you do. No one succeeds in doing what they hate. You might have to start at the bottom and work your way up. But chances are, if you love what you do, it\u2019s easier to make that happen. You\u2019ll actually enjoy the process of getting to the top. Earn the experience through different levels of work and when you feel like you have gained all that you can from it, consider moving on in other companies would widen your horizon on different business cultures. Putting more experiences in various positions would make you a more valuable asset for companies and making you a better option for higher rank duties. Consider how the rich are able to get in with the right companies, where there are plenty of opportunities for growth. Seek places where you can grow your skill and and are able to multiply your monthly income many times over 9. Cut your expenses. The biggest problem in some people\u2019s path of getting rich is that they always spend more than what they earn. Living below your means will be the easiest to get rich. Consistently track your progress on how much you\u2019re spending. Use an app or simply an Excel spreadsheet to make sure you always know how much money you have what where it\u2019s going. This gives you a proper place to review and refine what does and doesn\u2019t make sense in terms of your spending. Start cutting the unnecessary spendings in your life. Do what you can to reduce your bills: make sure you turn off the lights, plan meals to save at the grocery store, and be disciplined about eating in. Focus your life with only the necessities and in no time you will be saving a lot more than what you previously did. 10. Save it in your bank. Set savings goals and routines to support those goals. Figure out ways that work for you in saving money, and refine what doesn\u2019t. Many banks have the option of creating separate savings accounts, as well as automatic withdrawals. By setting up these automatic transfers, you save passively and have to make an effort not to save. Another thing you can try is to increase the amount of savings by 1% in every interval you wish. At first, it will be an insignificant change, but as time passes, you will notice a big difference. Give yourself a reason and motivation to save as well. It is always important to plan for the future and saving for retirement could be a great point to persuade yourself to stay away from excessive spending. 11. Make investments wisely Investment is much more than pure luck. One investment mistake could tear away a large chunk of your assets. So make sure whenever you are making decisions on investments, whether on properties or stock, think twice. It will be better for you to consider opinions from professionals and experts. To give you some ideas, legendary investor Warren Buffett suggested to put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&P 500 index fund, so that if the market crash, you will still be fine by cashing the 10% rather than selling the stock with a bad price. Getting Rich the Wise Way There are a lot more important things in life than accumulating wealth. Who wants to end up rich, unloved, lonely and in poor health? However, if you can enjoy a balanced life and at the same time become rich, why not do so? Taking combinations from the above suggestions may not guarantee you a prosperous future, but it will surely eliminate a lot of financial troubles in your life. With one step at a time, maybe you will also become the one you dreamed of. ",

My initial choice (AKA: Practice Wife) set me back 10 years, but I was able to recover quite nicely (she didn\u2019t).Avoid stupid \u201cinvestments\u201d, stick to solid mutual funds with 10 year + track records of high returns. I lost around $35,000 in my early 30\u2019s in the dot com bust of 2001\u2026 that would be worth over $92,000 (post taxes) in 2019 - DUMB move on my part, but I learned.

It\u2019s slow to start, but use the \u201cno debt snow ball\u201d method to get the first house, then the second\u2026 and the third. This approach has you saving to buy your first rental for cash, then keep saving and adding the rental profits for buy the second house (in about 60% of the time as the first), Keep saving and add both rental incomes to buy the 3rd house (about 33% of the time as the first), keep this up\u2026 you\u2019re saving the entire time and rolling all the rental profits into the \u201cnext house\u201d buying fund. It\u2019s a technique that has so little risk that you\u2019ll be fine AND gives you the ability to pay cash when the economy tanks and homes are cheap.",

            "answer_text": "Warren Buffett was asked \u201chow to becoming rich?\u201d Most expected a reply long & sour, but he kept it short & sweet: \u201cIf you don\u2019t find a way to make money while you sleep, you\u2019ll work until you die!\u201d  BECOMING RICH IS A RESULT, NOT A GOAL  I. The SCIENCE of MAKING MONEY  A few weeks ago as my uncle and I cheered for Tiger Woods, my aunt Sandra wasn\u2019t in the least bit interested in making golf putts. Rather, she was more interested in making money! \u201cNephew,\u201d she mumbled to me, \u201csince you\u2019re supposed to be a \u2018genius\u2019 and all, why don\u2019tcha tell your favorite auntie how to become rich?\u201d Inwardly I chuckled. \u201cSure thing, auntie.\u201d I wrapped an arm around her as we strolled to the kitchen. \u201cAuntie, ever heard of Socrates?\u201d She nodded while saying, \u201cI heard of rocket science too, Nephew, but that don\u2019t mean I know a damn thing about it!\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d I continued, \u201cin ancient times they called Socrates the wisest man in the world.\u201d \u201cSo what did he say about making money, Nephew?\u201d I whipped out my phone and leaned on Google for help:  With eyebrows raised she asked, \u201cSo what does \u2018making money\u2019 mean, then?\u201d Again I leaned on my pal, Google:  Given that example is better than precept, I had just the case in mind. I told my teenage cousin to let me borrow her iPhone 8 Plus. I then jokingly asked my uncle, \u201cHey, would you be willing to TRADE me your iPhone 6 for this shiny, new iPhone 8? Without blinking he said, \u201cYou damn right I will!\u201d I turned to my auntie and said, \u201cBingo! Now you know why the expression \u2018having a job\u2019 is used interchangeably with \u2018having a TRADE\u2019.\u201d  Aunt Sandra\u2019s blank expression suggested I needed to fill in the blank. \u201cAuntie, you see, before money became currency, it was first known as the barter system,\u201d I said. \u201cIn other words, back in the day one farmer TRADED his bushel of corn for another farmer\u2019s, hmmm, bushel of wheat. Got me? She nodded. \u201cAnd so, when you ask \u2018how do I make money?\u2019 in reality you\u2019re asking \u2018how do I make enough TRADES so as to qualify for my definition of rich.\u2019 Naturally she asked, \u201cWell, how do I make these trades, Nephew?\u201d \u201cBy simply following Einstein\u2019s advice, auntie!\u201d   II. In CLOSING: The SCIENCE of GETTING RICH DECODED  Long before the word genius got distorted, it had a far simpler meaning. In fact, the original meaning of genius is Latin: \u201cattendant spirit present from one's birth, innate ability or inclination [aka, passion].\u201d Bingo! According to the ancient Romans, then, each person comes into the world stamped with a genius! In the Vedic tradition, this ancient wisdom is known as one\u2019s dharma(\u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e). To put it simply:  To state it simply: the entire economic system was set up for individuals making good on their natural talent (genius) to be compensated by making money. Bingo! You see, in the Game of Life everyone is supposed to bring their special talent to the table and thereby receive their \u201cslice of the pie.\u201d You know: this lady paints in a special way . . . that guy dances in a special way . . . and so on.  Ahhh, but since we\u2019re living in the \u201creal world,\u201d the way the Game of Life is played in real-time was best summed up by Gandhi:  Hey: DON\u2019T HATE THE PLAYERS, HATE THE GAME! And so, given the cards dealt to us all, the Science of Getting Rich boils down to this: Only YOU . . . and you alone can figure out what constitutes your gift, aka your genius potential. For the above reasons, Warren Buffett went so far as to say:  And so, the Science of Getting Rich inevitably poses questions such as the following: Are you one of those people who naturally cracks people up? Are you the person about whom friends and family make comments such as \u201cyou sure can argue well . . . should\u2019ve been a lawyer\u2014I tell ya?\u201d Do you naturally sing with a voice so lovely even the hummingbirds stop chirping just to hear you perform live in the shower? What\u2019s your hobby? If money were no object, what would you do for a living? In other words, the Science of Getting Rich boils down to this:  Bingo! In short, aside from lucking up and winning the lottery . . . Or inheriting a fortune from some rich relative . . . Uncovering your God-given genius potential is the only way to guarantee you\u2019ll secure your financial future! Hey, that\u2019s just the way the Game of Life is setup! Muhammad Ali said it best:  The greater the service, the greater the wealth. \u2026 If you need some help, here\u2019s a few handy tools: The Science of Getting RichThink and Grow RichThe Master Key SystemIn short, becoming rich boils down to the following insight: find out what you\u2019re good at, and then you\u2019ll know what you\u2019re good for . . . which can only lead to good results! Besides, the above is the only way to ensure you\u2019ll take heed of Buffet\u2019s advice:  In short: NEVER follow the money but rather entice the money to follow you! Bingo! Here lies the only sure way to become rich, realistically. After all,     DOG fo DNIM ehT ",

            "answer_text": "Mostly, it is about controlling competition through aggregation. The closer you can get to a monopoly or a monopsony on a certain market, the richer you can be. Ideally both at the same time. Creating a bottleneck of sorts in the economy. This is how most of the current, successful businesses work. Let me give you an example: There are many restaurants delivering food, and many customers ordering food. Delivery men work for the restaurant, or for the customer, or can even try to be independent, but wont be rich. Now imagine you create a website to order food. Customers get all the options for food in one place, isnt that great? And restaurants get to sell their food without having to organize delivery, or deal with customers. So at first, you will be losing money. You pay people to make a website (or invest your time) for no financial return. You invest money or energy advertising, etc. After the initial investments, business will start, but probably not be profitable at first. There might be competitors too. You need more advertising, or discounts, or something. You need to invest in a trademark, and patents, and make sure people cant copy you. Maybe fight off some patent trolls, competitors wanting to boot you out, etc. The vast majority of businesses fail around this stage, mostly because of lack of capital. Another large portion gets bought out by competitors. But if there is enough capital, if expenses are low enough, and at some point you can grow, if you can buy out or take out competitors, or if there are none, if at some point you can end up taking a large market share, then you can start to dictate the market, and make huge amounts of profit. If you can end up being the only one, since all restaurants have to go through you, you get to dictate your terms, and since you are the only website available to customers, you can also set your prices there. Even for paying your delivery drivers. Huge profits. Now you can make billions. Amazon is a very similar idea. And so are all sorts of businesses. People search for stuff on the internet. Pages on the internet want to be seen. Google is the bottleneck. Farmers want to sell product, people need to buy stuff, supermarkets are the bottleneck. People want to go someplace for a little money, people want to make a little money driving, uber is the bottleneck. Some people need money, some people have money, banks are the bottleneck. Owners want to sell/rent, people want to buy/rent, real estate companies are the bottleneck. Etc The bottlenecks are completely arbitrary, you can create one wherever you want if you have enough ressources. With enough ressources, you could lobby for a law and create a bottleneck that way. Lets take something simple, like a tomato. If you can own most of the fertile land, you can set your prices when renting it, and make a huge profit that way. If not, you could aggregate all the land owners, and be a renting company, all the owners go through you to rent it to someone. Or you could be a farming company, trying to control most of the farmers in the area. Or a work agency selling farm work to farming companies. Or control the market in seed distribution. Or in fertilizer/pesticides. Or a trucking company. Or market distribution.Or delivery company to your door. At any point, you could create a monopoly or a monopsony, or be part of an oligopoly. And that is how you become rich. ",

            "answer_text": " I\u2019m seriously pissed. Because I went through many answers below and there wasn\u2019t a single mention about Naval Ravikant\u2019s amazing twitter threads or \u201ctweetstorms\u201d around this topic. It\u2019s titled, \u201cHow to Get Rich (without getting lucky)\u201d You might have gone through several articles, books, videos, and courses about this topic but trust me nothing comes close to how this man puts it together and that too each thought in a tweet\u2014140 words. Let\u2019s begin: How to Get Rich (without getting lucky) by Naval Ravikant Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy.Understand that ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you.Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.You\u2019re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom.You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale.Pick an industry where you can play long term games with long term people.The Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven't figured this out yet.Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity.Don't partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage.Specific knowledge is the knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you.Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others.When specific knowledge is taught, it\u2019s through apprenticeships, not schools.Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated.Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.The most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands: Oprah, Trump, Kanye, Elon.\u201cGive me a lever long enough, and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.\u201d - ArchimedesFortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge, with accountability, and show resulting good judgment.Labor means people working for you. It's the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don\u2019t waste your life chasing it.Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.Code and media are permissionless leverage. They're the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.An army of robots is freely available - it's just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it.If you can't code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts.Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgment.Judgment requires experience but can be built faster by learning foundational skills.There is no skill called \u201cbusiness.\u201d Avoid business magazines and business classes.Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers.Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.You should be too busy to \u201cdo coffee,\" while still keeping an uncluttered calendar.Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it.Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work.Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.There are no get rich quick schemes. That's just someone else getting rich off you.Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually, you will get what you deserve.When you're finally wealthy, you'll realize that it wasn't what you were seeking in the first place. But that's for another day. In case you don\u2019t know who Naval Ravikant is. I\u2019d directly like to quote ProductHunt here : Naval is the CEO and Co-founder of AngelList, a platform for startups, investors, and job seekers dedicated to democratizing the investment process. In addition to building AngelList, he\u2019s also actively invested in over 150 startups to date, including Twitter, Uber, Yammer, and Shyp. I highly recommend listening to his podcast. Because there he goes in-depth on his tweets and explains the concepts with more detail and context. If you\u2019re a student, entrepreneur, developer or anyone who aspires to launch their own company, you should be actively getting your minds blown by this man\u2019s perspectives on various topics. I\u2019ve linked his handles below. What was your favorite quote from above? Let me know in the comments.

            "answer_text": "I don't normally answer questions with so many answers, not least because I feel obliged to read what everyone has written first and who has the time and energy (and frankly the mental fortitude required) to read 43 answers about becoming rich? But I was asked to so I thought about it for a bit... My first reaction to this is one that Benjamin Johnson would apparently not approve of - you should re-evaluate what you want from life because \"become rich\" isn't a particularly good goal. After all, becoming rich isn't easy so the chances are good that you'll fail and even if you succeed you might well find you're not happier as a result. Why put all your efforts into something so clearly misdirected? Try becoming happy instead. And if you can't manage that, maybe try becoming content? Those strike me as being better, albeit hopelessly vague goals too. My second reaction is that without any further details there is little specific advice I can offer. I could take the perfectly reasonable approach Brian Leyde took and just tell you how I made my money but (a) his approach is probably easier and more likely to be successful (b) I've already explained that in Hedge Fund Managers: How do you become a hedge fund manager? What prior experience and qualifications are needed?  so if you want to copy me that's the route and (c) I'm not rich - though see my answer to How do you know if you're rich or, going to be rich?  for my thoughts on that. I could give you what I think is the right advice - working hard is the key factor that you control that determines how successful you are. I would take (and have taken) a hard worker over a more talented one. After all it's not *that* difficult to become moderately rich - How hard is it to become a millionaire? - if you're prepared to put in the work required. But that's so boring! Even with an exclamation mark after it! Who wants to hear they need to work hard? Especially someone who only devoted nine words to the question in the first place. So I'll point out that there is an alternative to working hard Is there no substitute for hard work? Unfortunately I think there's probably a positive correlation between how boring the advice is on this site and how good an idea it is to follow that advice, though I'm sure James Altucher would have other, much better written and far more exciting, things to say about that. I could also give you vague but reasonable sounding advice like Nolan Ross or a more specific answer in a niche area like Lilly Grace but those people have already done that, and there's plenty of useful tidbits already thanks to people like Kendrick Bowman for my thoughts to add much there. ...and I've come to the conclusion that I shouldn't answer questions that already have 43 answers.

            "answer_text": "The path to getting rich is really pretty simple. You 1) spend less that you make so that you are building up wealth and 2) you find ways to increase your income so that your wealth builds faster. The first criteria is actually far easier than many people realize. If the average person would buy $3000 cars for cash their whole lives and not hold car payments, or eat most meals in, they would generate plenty of free cash flow to have several million dollars at retirement. You can find the analysis for how buying used cars will make you a millionaire here. The second criteria, increasing income, is often done by going to college to get a higher paying job and working one's way up in a company to higher paying jobs. In general, the more money you make for a company, the higher you can be paid, so being able to manage othes pays better than just performing a task yourself. Other people start companies or find side jobs to increase their income. When you work for yourself, your ability to increase your income is only limited to how big a company you can grow and manage well. Note the more people you serve, the more money you make. Another way to increase your income is to invest. By buying assets like stocks and rental buildings, you can increase your income since these assets will generate income for you once you buy them. It is like you're running a business except it is much easier to do. Being able to invest requires that you have some free cash flow available, which goes back to criteria one for growing wealthy. You need to free up cash each month to allow you to invest and it is by steady investing that you become wealthy. Both budgetting and investing are therefore required. If you increase your income but then just spend the extra, you won\u2019t become rich. If you can create a circular loop, where money from your investments are used to buy more assets, you can grow wealth very quickly. Plus, once you set it up, it builds on itself with no more work by you. ",

I got a percentage of whatever I was making.  I was waitressing almost full time when I was getting my high school diploma.    I looked after children.   Waitressed even more.   And worked part-time in a local theatre at both the bar and as a vendor for their tickets.  Many people in my circle couldn\u2019t do what they had wanted because they had no money. I didn\u2019t want to be one of them. I had big dreams. Most of what I had earned enabled me to travel throughout Europe and the US. Some of it I had invested and the rest of it is going to help me finance law school. There\u2019s no way of getting \u201crich\u201d without putting in the work into gaining your own capital first. I knew there was no one paying anything for me, which served as a huge motivation.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not a millionaire - but I really like my chances. I\u2019m 28, I do the kind of work I love, and I\u2019ve been accumulating assets for the past five years. I don\u2019t like the term \u201cnet worth,\u201d but if we\u2019re talking pure statistics, mine\u2019s significantly higher than the median in my age group. So without any guarantees or assuming I know it all, here are the steps I\u2019ve had to go through to get to where I am.  1. Stop demonizing money and the people who have it. In Germany we have a saying that translates to \u201cmoney doesn\u2019t stink.\u201d It goes back to the ancient Romans. They collected urine from public toilets for leather tanning. One day, emperor Vespasian put a tax on it and his son called him out on it. He grabbed some of the money, held it under his nose and said: \u201cDoes the smell bother you?!\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d his son replied, \u201cand yet it\u2019s made of urine.\u201d That\u2019s why today, the saying usually means the opposite: Something\u2019s fishy here. It\u2019s our default setting. I had no idea how limiting this was until I spotted it in myself, even as someone who never considered himself anti-money. Usually, it\u2019s just jealousy in a clever disguise.  Whether you like it or not, you always act somewhat in line with your true beliefs. This whole \u201cwhat you focus on grows\u201d thing? That\u2019s real. At least on a long enough timeline. Setting up our beliefs to attract money is the most important part. If you want money, just be honest about it. Don\u2019t hide it, don\u2019t sugarcoat it, and don\u2019t tell yourself getting rich the ethical way isn\u2019t possible. As long as you do, you\u2019ll never get anywhere. 2. Stop seeking status. The reason \u201cmoney is evil\u201d keeps people from getting it is that it\u2019s a status game. You\u2019re so overly concerned with spreading that message and deriving status from it that you have no time or attention left to do things that, well, make money! But there are many other status games that hinder the entrepreneur: Politics. Politics is one big networking and lobbying game to get the right gatekeepers at the right time to kindly move out of the way for you. Who wants to rely on that?Prestige. There\u2019s a quote along the lines of \u201crich people stay rich by living like they're broke. Broke people stay broke by living like they're rich.\u201d Take apart your finances. Look at every expense. How many are status-driven? How many are necessary? And how many are really good for you?Prominence. Maybe, you\u2019re the funny one in your social group. Maybe, you\u2019re the slacker. The anti-establishment guy or the riot girl. Over time, we become invested in our standing among our peers and want to maintain it.If you seek wealth, status games are a distraction. You have to play money games. 3. Stop rejecting responsibility and start taking it without being asked to. Why did I just say \u201chinder the entrepreneur?\u201d Because one way or another, you\u2019ll have to become one to make a lot of money. The reason is simple: responsibility. We pay people based on the amount of responsibility they voluntarily take on their shoulders. That\u2019s why an employee will always have limited earning potential: she caps her responsibility. 99% of people\u2019s actions in corporations are moves in a giant shift-the-blame game. Junior employees blame senior employees who blame their boss so they can blame their boss\u2019s boss. And leadership? They hire consultants and point to the next company, where the cycle starts all over again. Saying \u201cI\u2019ll write two articles each week for you\u201d is taking responsibility. Saying \u201cI promise this lemonade will taste good\u201d is taking responsibility. Saying \u201cWe\u2019ll deliver the shoes you want for free\u201d is taking responsibility. No responsibility, no wealth. And the world won\u2019t hand it to you. So take it. 4. Stop wasting your leverage and start using your time to build some. The good thing about taking responsibility is that it also comes with leverage. 2,000 years ago, Archimedes said: \u201cGive me a place to stand, and a lever long enough, and I will move the world.\u201d That\u2019s what wealthy people do to this day. They\u2019re thinkers with leverage. I learned this from a man named Naval.  Leverage amplifies your decisions. If you can help one person for $10, but have access to 10,000 people who have the same problem, that\u2019s $100,000. If you can pick a stock that will 3x in value, the more money you can buy of it, the better. And so on. In today\u2019s world, leverage comes in the form of money, labor, the internet, and software. In the beginning, we have zero leverage. No one\u2019s working for us, we have no audience, no product, and very little money. In fact, we often waste the little leverage we have by spending our savings on liabilities, like a car or a house. Don\u2019t! Because up to a certain amount, money is just leverage. No one needs $100 million, but most people can\u2019t live their whole lives on $1 million either. If you never reach the right threshold, it ultimately won\u2019t matter. So when you start out, be tight with your money and use your time to build leverage. Run a podcast, write articles, code little gadgets, rally your friends into offering a service. Whatever costs only time, but gets you precious leverage. 5. Work hard and quit things that don\u2019t work. Time isn\u2019t leverage because it doesn\u2019t multiply anything. So it\u2019s not as valuable. But it\u2019s the most limited resource we have and the one with which we build everything. Therefore, you have to spend a large chunk of your time acquiring leverage. It\u2019s true that what you work on is more important than how much you work, but very few people get rich without hard work. That\u2019s dumb luck and you can\u2019t rely on it. Choose a pace you feel comfortable with and don\u2019t apologize for it. It\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t want to sacrifice your health or friends, but you should also know that it\u2019ll be very hard to become wealthy if you\u2019re constantly obsessed with work-life balance. Most of all, abandon what doesn\u2019t work as fast as you can. If you can\u2019t understand stocks, but get trading forex, do that. If you suck at writing, but look great on video, do that. If you\u2019re bad at coding, but good at talking people into it, do that. And so on. Whatever it is, if it won\u2019t lead to more leverage in a decent time frame, don\u2019t do it. Do all of this long enough and, one day, you\u2019ll be rich.  It\u2019s funny. We think getting rich is about knowing and doing many things and getting lucky. Actually, it\u2019s mostly about unlearning a whole bunch of wealth-rejecting habits. After that, what\u2019s left is rather simple: Taking focused action in a clear direction, all aimed at acquiring leverage and being rewarded exponentially for your good judgment. Stop shunning money. Stop playing status games. Start taking responsibility. Start building leverage. Work hard and drop failures early. To my best knowledge, these are the steps that will make you rich. And I\u2019ll keep doing them until I win. ",

            "answer_text": "I know one illegal secret to become rich .I think lots of people doing it right now but it is not recommended.I m writing this for a n educational purpose. People s doing this with betting , forex binary option.Something that has 50 chance of winning or losing .Like someone s betting the number is gonna be up or down.For example person bet some money that number is gonna be up , if it finishes up they win the money, if it finishes down they lost that money.Ok that was betting .Now about the secret .This is how it works. First scammer gathers lots of people with ads or other ways. Lets say he has 10000 people.and he emails all of them something like \u201cI know the outcome that it is gonna finish up or down I will prove you that.\u201d First event he sends 5000 people number is gonna be up and he sends another 5000 people number is gonna be down.Lets say it finished up(for him outcome doesn t matters) those 5000 people who he sends up won.He ignores other 5000 people that lost . Now he left with 5000 people .After that he s doing again with another event .Same he divides them into 2 again and sends 2500 is gonna be up or sends other 2500 group of people down.Lets it finished down.The group who bet down won.He again ignores other group.Now he left with 2500 .Now those already saw that he predicted outcome right twice.Then he continues in same way. He sends half of people down half of people up.After third event he left with 1250 people, after 4th event he left with 625 people, after 5 th event he left with 312 people.Now he stops there (if he wants he can continue). Those 312 people already believed him 5 times. Then he writes some bullshit book for few pages.And tell those 312 people i am selling my secret how i know stock will go up or down for 200 dollars (or less or more).Around 90 percent of those people(maybe more) will buy the secret that he selling because they already saw he is not lying he knows something.Also if they followed him up in 5th time they made some money to buy the book.300 \u00d7200=60000. he made 60000 dollars.Yeah that was it. If you see someones trying to sell you free betting ideas or something like this be careful , because it is hard catch this scam.(you can t see what he sending to other people).There re scammers out there who made millions with this method(they start with more people). Thanks for reading. ",

To get one\u2019s thoughts executed with enough power, this means controlling a direct or indirect stake of at least 51% (majority) of that business that is started or will be created in the future. My strategy is to form a company that shields itself from maximum tax payouts to any government system, while at the same time impacting the most people on the planet as possible, in a legal, honest way, with good intentions to provide customers meaningful benefits. The business model will be to provide as much value as possible so the profit that the company makes is a small portion of the effect of the price that is being charged. Continuing innovation to be the top in one\u2019s field with maximum performance that makes the competition look like amateurs.

            "answer_text": " You went to the supermarket to buy a box blueberries. It\u2019s $3 per box and you buy it. The next day, the price has been increased to $249 per box. Would you buy them? \u2014 I don\u2019t think so. On your way to the exit, you hear the telly. There has been a study that proves blueberry can cure cancer. Now, will you buy them for $249? \u2014 If you are smart, yes. They are about in-demand with limited supply. That\u2019s how people get rich. Money flows where the demand is more than the supply \u2014 You need to increase the demand and the scarcity of your product or service. There are a few ways to do that.  #1 By Increasing Value. From the blueberry's story, you know people pay more when the value of the product/service increases. Whether you in a job or business, focus on increasing the value. How can you provide so much value that people can\u2019t help but pay you more? Make your clients more money, sell a higher-quality product. Only when you serve, you will be rewarded. #2 Money is NOT evil. People have unconscious beliefs about wealth \u2014 \u201cWealthy people are evil\u201d \u201cThey take from the poor\u201d. They aren\u2019t true \u2014 \u201cMoney makes you more of who you are\u201d. If you are a bad person, the money will allow you to do bad things. If you are a good person, the money will allow you to do good things. You aren\u2019t stomping on poor if you earn money the right way i.e. by providing value to people. If your product/service helps more than it takes, you aren\u2019t evil. Not everyone can afford to work but the ones that do change their life. What price-tag would you put to have the business, relationships, or physique you want? What\u2019s the price of being content? \u2014 I certainly charge lower than that. I give my clients my all and I get compensated for that highly. I am not bragging, just showing you the universal law of value. #3 Use Money to Make Money. When you make more money you shouldn\u2019t hoard or consume it all. Use that money to bring even more value in the marketplace. \u2014 Invest in courses, coaches, books, outsourcing. People will keep paying because you keep adding value. The question should always be, how to provide more? Once you this loop of value going on, you will be swimming in money. ",

            "answer_text": " If you want to be rich, do what the rich are doing\u2026and start now. Physical humans are the only ones in all of the universe that believe in lack. Lack doesn\u2019t exist but physical beings have managed to vibrate in a way where they hold themselves apart from the things they want. \u2013Esther Hicks (Teachings of Abraham). We live in a world of abundance; there is abundance of wealth, health, riches, deposits of gold and diamonds\u2026 of yet untapped resources\u2026 of ideas, and the list goes\u2026ad infinitum. But the question has always been: Why is there poverty in this world? Why is there lack? Why scarcity of basic human needs? The answer is simply because we have been taught to believe in a lie, society has so programmed our minds to believe in scarcity, and this lie-virus has been sweeping through humanity. Truth is, lack doesn\u2019t exist, abundance does. Even the so called recession is a big lie fed upon our subconscious by the so called economist, there is abundance of wealth and riches for anyone who wishes to tap into Universal Source (God). A brief entry into Quantum Physics will help us understand it better\u2026 \u201cIf you break the solid world down to smaller and tinier components, you will see that what appears to be solid is a dance \u2013 a dance of particles and empty spaces. Go to the tiniest of those quantum particles and you discover that it emanated from a source that vibrates so fast that it defies the world of small beginnings and endings. This highest/ fastest source is called Source Energy. We all originated in this vibration and then moved into a world of things, bodies, minds and egos. It was in leaving of this source energy in our minds and bodies that we took on our entire world of problems, illness, scarcities and fears.\u201d Forget all the above mentioned Metaphysics jargons (forgive my lack of modesty), in a nutshell, it means we all came from a source energy (God) that is abundant and vast in resources that is infinitely infinite and cannot be exhausted in a gadzillion years or centuries, and we the physical representations here on earth of that Infinite Source Energy cannot live in anything but abundance. Those who have lacks in their lives do not understand this basic truth, if they do, then they will start to experience the joy of abundance. So what is our job here on planet earth if we are to attract abundance in our lives. We must first believe in abundance of everything we want, think of abundance, speak of abundance always in our lives, take actions that bring  and live in abundance (even if at the moment its not there). Whenever the thought of lack, scarcity or poverty comes our way, we must immediately cast it out and proclame abundance always. Peter Diamandis in his 2012 book, Abundance: the future is better than you think says \u201cHistory is littered with tales of once-rare resources made plentiful by innovation. The reason is pretty straightforward: scarcity is often contextual. Imagine a giant orange tree packed with fruit. If I pluck all the oranges from the lower branches, I am effectively out of accessible fruit. From my limited perspective, oranges are now scarce. But once someone invents a piece of technology called a ladder, I\u2019ve suddenly got new reach. Problem solved. Technology is a resource-liberating mechanism. It can make the once scarce the now abundant.\u201d Call To Action (CTA): Use the available technology tools to bring abundance to your daily lives. Start today, start now! Ask the Doc - Docotal ",

            "answer_text": "Totally agreeing with Howard in writing things down. That\u2019s a must. To younger especially folks, I think we should: SAVE MONEYSAVE MONEYOh and if I missed it, SAVE MONEYNotice I say \u201cWe\u201d because I\u2019m learning it myself. Millennials for example, earn to spend, but we have to get back to our old ways for earning to save. The Guardian put it great. Let\u2019s call it the millennial paradox. You\u2019re in your 20s, and suddenly, you\u2019re actually making money. The problem is that something or someone is after every single dollar. You need to pay off your student loans; you need to cover your living costs. You need to save for the short term \u2013 the next vacation; an emergency fund \u2013 as well as for your retirement. Maybe you\u2019re helping out a family member, as well. The worst of it all is that probably all of these demands on the finite number of dollars you\u2019re making are just as important as each other. And then along comes the Financial Times, with a survey concluding that \u2013 tsk, tsk, tsk \u2013 millennials are prioritizing short-term spending over long-term saving. According to one calculation, the average 25-year-old should be saving \u00a3800 (or about $1,146) a month over the next 40 years, in order to retire at 65 with an annual income of \u00a330,000. We also think logarithmically as humans. Ever heard of the psychophysics of price paradox?  4:30m in, Michael says how the more of something we have, the less of it it means to us. Proportionally, we value money this is not how we should think logically when it comes to using our additive currency of dollars. I like what this guy says:  He talks about thinking very very very long and hard about if you\u2019re really solving a problem people have and going to generate revenue before you invest a cent in your business idea. I\u2019ll give you two more things. The startup methodology, and pitching to investors. If you have a business idea that you want to scale, your 20\u2019s is the time to get your feet wet. Startup Methodology: What I would suggest is to Hypothesize and Test the market to know if your startup is desired in the first place.I suggest making something called a lean canvas. Check this out: LEANSTACK: Lean Startup and Business Model Canvas Tools, Content, and Coaching for Entrepreneurs leanstack.com This website says, A lean canvas is an adaptation of Business Model Canvas by Alexander Osterwalder which Ash Maurya created in the Lean Startup spirit. Lean Canvas promises an actionable and entrepreneur-focused business plan. It focuses on problems, solutions, key metrics and competitive advantages.  The \u201ccanvas\u201d movement is part of larger trends in the business world AgileLean startupDecreasing cost of entrySeed investment explosionStartup \u201chacking\u201d  Yeah so it may help to document how you successfully built your machine, get it down to a science so that it\u2019s replicable! 2. Build it Is it an MVP-only build to prove a point to an investor?Is it already a semi feature-rich MVP?Have you proven proof of concept and want to have a solid architecture that holds a first stage of acquisition?Are you already looking for a website ready to scale?After defining the scope, you need to understand what will be your approach into getting the build done? Are you going to outsource this construction? You can do it via Odesk (oDesk, the world's largest online workplace ) or Fiverr (Get everything you need starting at $5) and it's potential the \"lowest short term cost\" you might have. Do this short term, because if not, you can get high Technical debt.Are you hiring an agency or temporary contracts to build the startup? Although the cost is higher than above, the access to information and learning from the code that is delivered can be better quality.Are you hiring an in-house technical team? Again, the cost increases as now salaries are in the table but all development is done internally, and control of iterations is not only faster but the learning comes right away.Are you getting a technical co-founder/CTO? Cheapest short term, most expensive long term, and the best value for money.Fortunately, co-founder s are paid in equity so it\u2019s cheaper in terms of instant physical money, but expensive long term in company shares.Unfortunately, can be the most expensive long term because if you get a very valuable business, the equity you granted becomes worth a lot so you paid a lot!It can be cheaper if your company fails. Any equity shared will then be worthless so you only had your time and opportunity cost.Cost matrix:  3.

I speak more generally, but in building my baby, Hypetroop Market I heard something clever from Mike Dillard\u2019s video and some lessons from some classes. Now, Pitching to Investors: I had to learn from some high up people. Luckily it resulted being awarded the Techcrunch 2016 hackathon (5000+ attendees). Here was my experience at an elevator pitch event in San Francisco. When I was bustling Silicon Valley, I decided to pitch at a pitch competition. Learn how the VC\u2019s and investors in the capitol of capitalism work. The email read: Hi Natu, Thank you for signing up to pitch at our event on Thursday, September 8th! I replied and asked if we needed a pitch deck, HDMI, and he was like: Hi Natu, The event is not videoed, however you are free to have someone video your pitch as well as your Q&A session. As for your question about the pitch deck, please refer to the attachment I have included in the previous email with the guidelines for the event. The pitch is a 2-minute elevator pitch that permits only you and your message, so no slide decks, visual aids or notes of any kind will be permitted. If you have any other questions about the event, I will be happy to answer them. Cool. He attached a docx file to the email with eight detailed points. I sketched up a pitch loosely based around them. My Hypetroop Market project is exceedingly small for now, and I just wanted to market on one major channel. I my \u201cask\u201d in the sample pitch was $10k. After all, I wanted to be lean and scrappy\u200a\u2014\u200akeep equity (blame my Canadian business like conservatism I guess) Here way my email pitch v.1. Hello, My exact pitch will change, but it\u2019s based on the following. What are your initial thoughts? The most valuable thing to budding music artist and their suppliers are resources. Necessity is locked away from new artists because they spend their days searching for gigs and real life collabs instead of making amazing projects. Hypetroop is the solution\u200a\u2014\u200aa marketplace with that builds relationships and collaborations between music artists and suppliers in various genres. Hypetroop is a marketplaces for music artists and any anyone who can help an artist create projects. Hypetroop is unique from indirect competitors because there\u2019s no collaboration platform that puts culture first on a genre by genre basis for gigs. This makes us uncloneable. Promotions, tutorials, and gamification will boost loyalty and retention. This solution was cocreated with 400 users in the last month who agreed to join Hypetroop as soon as it launches. Raised 2.5k of donations on a kickstarter campaign from our target market last year with 40 percent of users saying the would pay to use the platform. This market is growing so fast that there aren\u2019t any clear ways of measuring I\u2019m asking for the lean ask $10,000 to begin an ambitious project. Hypetroop to needs to circumvent the cost database scaling and promoting on the largest hip hop marketing platform hiphopdx for a launch push and own hip hop. There is a 10% average clickthrough rate on mobile, of their 30 million pageviews in a month Based on hypetroop\u2019s financial model, this will result in 13 million in revenue if we have 55,000 active users. This gets bumped up to 20million if a freemium model was implemented. Hypetroop is the solution software that bridges the gap between budding music artists and budding suppliers such as producers, and graphic designers providing gigs between the users. As a highly validated lean solution to the amateur musician crisis, Hypetroop will flip the music industry on it\u2019s head. Thanks for your time. Ok, it\u2019s a start, I thought. Natu: You need to rework this and use our 8 points. Also, and this is key, you don\u2019t ask Angels for a $10K LOAN. Angels are looking to invest and asking for only $10K is embarrassing. Figure out what you can do with $150K-$250K..not $10K. Pease rewrite this, make a video of it and send it back to us. I replied with: Ok I\u2019m reworking it now. It wasn\u2019t a loan it says \u201clean ask\u201d because I didn\u2019t want to give up much equity. Later in the day I saw this in my inbox: Natu: I\u2019m forwarding this [example pitch] because it\u2019s a great pitch and this is the way to write your pitch. You want to raise money using a convertible note. I was fired up. Here was pitch v.2. Thanks for the advice. Here\u2019s a quick iPhone video [video] Me I\u2019m Natu a serial entrepreneur, rapper, and computer science graduate with experience in building consumer facing projects with 10 years experience in web. Product Hypetroop is a marketplace with that builds relationships and collaborations between music artists and suppliers in various genres. Market and Problem Our initial target market are amateur rappers and producer interested in hip hop and edm and graphic designers. We will then move on to all genres. The Hypetroop saves them 200 hours a year searching for real life collabs through it\u2019s seamless platform. What could you do with an extra month of time? [Team: undisclosed to Quora] Traction and Potential This solution was validated and co-created with 600 users in the 23 days who agreed to join Hypetroop as soon as it launches In this same time we raised 2.5k of donations from our target market saying they want to see the platform come to life. Based on the high clickthrough rates and page views this will result in 190 million in revenue monthly opportunity in hip hop alone. The other genres are worth 80% more of the market meaning 1B monthly is in reach. The next move is to move on to other genres. This isn\u2019t including B2B sales and ad revenue. Revenue Model Hypetroop makes money by taking 9 percent from each transaction and by having a pro version that\u2019s 4.99 a month. B2B marketing will also take place for record labels. Ask Althrough there\u2019s are low overhead capitol I\u2019m asking ask $125,000 to make this reach it\u2019s potential on the the largest hip hop marketing platforms such as hiphopdx for a launch push and own hip hop and to build a robust team to scale. Exit Hypetroop may be purchased by soundcloud or spotify one day to bridge the connection between fans and artists. The elearning community motivate anyone to become a musician and push Hypetroop to attract more users. It flip the music industry on it\u2019s head by empowering young artists. Thanks for your time. He replied by saying: Natu: This is about 50X better than the first script that you sent earlier today!! I was pleased, so I replied. I appreciate the help. I\u2019ll send a better video if I get the chance to. That was just the email exchange, the physical pitch is coming up in another blog post. Of course, during the actually in\u2014person pitch I choke. I got a 3/5 score though. Key thing, don\u2019t be stiff, understand these eight points, and they will serve you well. I'm freely giving out a hefty package of notes (including the slides from above) made by Silicon Valley execs, to MBA's on how to start a startup hope it helps.

What you choose to do with it is entirely your own decision to make. If a man offered you one-hundred thousand dollars for you leg, would you take it? For most men, the answer is: Probably, yeah, well\u2026 Why, who\u2019s paying and when can we do this?! Would you sell your arm for another one-thousand dollars? How about your eye, your other leg, or your other arm and so on\u2026 Tally up your entire body, and you\u2019ll reach a million dollars or more. Perhaps this is the first time you\u2019ve realized you\u2019re a millionaire without ever knowing it. Needless to say, life is valuable, yet, it is an unfortunate shame that so many men today, waste it all away. Things like luck or even intelligence play no role in success, though many gentlemen still believe into the fallacy wholeheartedly. You certainly don\u2019t have to born with a silver spoon in your mouth, or have a lot of \u201cconnections\u201d either, as they always like to say. The truth is, if you want to know how to be a super successful businessman in this world, all that is required of you, is to be breathing! After reading this guide you will know exactly why this is true. If you are in doubt, you haven\u2019t done it. Many of these steps will make you sick to your stomach, perhaps you will sh-t your pants. With all the misinformation thrown at you over the years on business and success by doofuses, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised one bit. With that said, I would like to welcome you to uneasiness of being a super successful businessman and entrepreneur. Here\u2019s to your success! 1. Face reality, there is no work \u2013 life \u2013 balance! There\u2019s only work \u2013 life \u2013 choices. All of which have consequences. Birthdays, holidays anniversaries, etc. are for poor people. Men who refuse to believe that, are riddled with excuses. It starts with the younger gentlemen saying things like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll get it done\u2026 If I don\u2019t have a hangover, if I\u2019m not loaded up on drugs, only if it\u2019s between my tennis and golf lessons.\u201d Then it progresses to men with families, who have grown into their years. Their excuses shift to things like, \u201cUnless I have to take my son to the dentist.\u201d \u201cUnless I have to take my family to counseling.\u201d But by far, the biggest excuse of them all: \u201cI want to have a life\u201d. 2. Eagles fly alone. Do you want to have a life? Look at the high-performance businessmen of the world. I\u2019m talking about the Bransons, Zuckerbergs, Gates, and Trumps. They don\u2019t go the Super Bowl or World Cup. They are not going to all the college football bowl games. If they did end up going, you can be certain they wouldn\u2019t go with a group of drunk assholes. When it comes to entrepreneurship, loneliness is a topic no one wants to talk about. The truth is, it\u2019s very lonely at the top. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you have to feel depressed about it. Gentlemen who truly love what they\u2019re doing, are always high on life. They don\u2019t need friends or drugs to feel good. In other words, show me your friends, and I\u2019ll show you your future. You can\u2019t be a high-performance business hanging around with a bunch of losers and bums. You ARE the result of the five people you spend the most time around with. For most men, that includes mom, dad, a brother or sister, and a close friend. If you go to the bar every night to watch the game, belch, fart and down a pint of beer with friends, I guarantee you will be doing that for the rest of your life. Time is the MOST valuable thing a man can spend in his life. Why in the world are you wasting it? Most men think they have plenty of it, the reality is, and that\u2019s just not true. 3. It\u2019s bloody hard, regardless of what happens to you in life. Any person who tells you anything different hasn\u2019t been successful! Regardless if you\u2019re a high-performance person or a dipsh-t, life is difficult for every man out there. What separates successful men from the failures is one thing: How you end up reacting to and interrupting what happens to you in life. Truthfully, we all have issues. However, high-performance businessmen accept the issues, learn how to deal with them, and move forward right past them. 4. There\u2019s only one way to grow as an individual. You must step out of your comfort zone, and keep swinging until you hit a home run, every single day. You\u2019ve got to start sticking your head out like a turtle. Theodore Roosevelt once wrote a book on how to become fearless and courageous. Summed up, the point entailed creating drills and lists. It starts by naming one thing you are deathly afraid of doing, and you repeat the process every day. At the end of the day, you must accomplish it! Do things that are beyond your wildest expectations. Set goals in life which you cannot possibly obtain in two or even three lifetimes. 10x your goals! You must constantly grow more and more ambitious. For example, it\u2019s like the Hunchback of Notre Dame asking Marlin Monroe out on a date. It certainly is a big stretch to make. Ideally, you want to get stuck in courage and continually sucker yourself into being successful. Start seeing possibilities where others only see limitations. Remember, that customers too, will continually raise the bar when it comes to their level of expectation. Keep up! 4. Burn your ships. As surprising as it is, thousands of men, every single fu-king day, try to get back with their ex. They don\u2019t know how to make a clean break. Instead, they give them ties in which to get back into their life. Why is that? They aren\u2019t just desperate, they are relying on sh-t like backup plans, fail safes, plan B\u2019s, etc. (They are afraid of being alone.) It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re in the business world or the dating game, those things will destroy you! As Alexander the Great once said, equipping your mind to deal with ultimately overcome fear is the difference in battle. Consider Caesar\u2019s failed first invasion of Britain back in 54BC. Sure, he was disastrously defeated, however, his second invasion in 55BC would forever change the story. His plan the second time included burning the ships of his men. By doing so, he forced them to either succeed or ultimately die. There was no backup plan, there could be no retreat! If you have things like a plan b in place, you\u2019ve already built that kind of thinking into your subconscious. You will fail! You\u2019re essentially telling yourself, \u201cIt\u2019s okay to fail\u201d. Failure must NEVER be an option. Remember, FEAR is false expectations appearing real. You must never be afraid of fear, nor the idea of embarrassing yourself. Neither of two ever stopped Caesar from claiming victory he believed to be rightfully his. 5. You can accomplish anything with sacrifice. Every man knows how to lose weight, yet, 60% of the United States is obese. Shocking right? How to lose weight is well-advertised, there are an endless number of writings on the subject. However, it\u2019s still not enough, and in reality, it will never be enough. Because most men are not willing to pay the price of action or make the sacrifices! You know how to eat healthily and go to the gym goddammit. There\u2019s a reason the rich men of this world have more choices in life. It\u2019s because they were willing to make MORE sacrifices EARLY on. In comparison, most guys today proclaim the same old sh-t, \u201cI want to have a life\u201d. Too many gentlemen have their priorities ass backwards. 6. Your emotional bank account is what forces you to quit. Not your financial bank account. Seeking investment costs you nothing! Hell, most of the time bankers will end up buying you a free lunch. You must admit to yourself why you\u2019re so f-cked up in the first place. In 99% of all cases for most men, it begins with their parents. Most men starting out in the business world only know one thing: What their parents taught them. Let\u2019s face it, parents procreate, and it\u2019s one of the last things they\u2019re actually prepared to do. Most of them don\u2019t have a clue about how to churn out a high-performance kid. Of course, the exception being that you were raised by say, world-class Olympian athletes at the top of their food chain for example. In the first seven to eight years of your life, your self-esteem is built. It\u2019s the time in which you spend around your parents. Remember again, you are the result or average of the five people you spend most of your time with. That\u2019s normally mom, dad, an older brother/sister, etc. Out of all of these people, none have any idea nor recipe nor knowledge for success. Consider Babe Ruth\u2019s quote, \u201cIt\u2019s very tough to beat someone who never gives up.\u201d Also remember, if you don\u2019t love yourself, nobody is going to love you! You must be able to deal with the emotional unsteadiness of success. 7. Smell the leather. Get a good whiff of luxury. Go to the Rolls Royce and Lamborghini dealers and window shop. Tour million dollar homes. Visit country clubs, even if you can only afford a single dinner once a month. Give yourself a reason to set your goals higher and higher. See your dreams come to life before they actually happen. Focus on the goal line, not the rocky road ahead standing in your way. Every businessman out there knows one thing to be true: The road the success is always under construction. Even lawyers and accountants you cannot afford will see you. More than often, the first few meetings are free. Dress presidential. Wear what successful businessmen wear, a suit. Ditch the jeans and t-shirt. It doesn\u2019t matter if you wear a suit to the grocery store or banking office. Either you act your most successful all the time or you don\u2019t! Remember, these small habits can dramatically change the way you mentally think about, and ultimately perceive yourself. Of course, first impressions are everything. You never really know who you\u2019ll run into while out on the town either. Dream now and in the future, these things will come true. It\u2019s not some feel good motto, it\u2019s real life and perhaps one of man\u2019s greatest secrets. If you don\u2019t believe it, you haven\u2019t done it! I think Earl Nightingale said it best, \u201cWe are what we think about.\u201d It\u2019s as simple as that. 8. Be Selfish! Whoever said having too much money was a bad thing, doesn\u2019t know where to shop. Period. Let\u2019s face it, you can\u2019t fix things in life with Zen, it takes money. It\u2019s time to stop worrying about things like global warming when you can\u2019t even afford the monthly payments on your Toyota Yaris. If you really want to change those things, you can, but it requires wealth and money first. Almost all of things we worry about in life are simply inconsequential, meaning there\u2019s no consequence. In the cosmos of time in this big world, nobody is nothing more than a fart in the wind. Even Thomas Edison is a fart in the wind! While most men live lives of quiet desperation, the truth is, if they were never born it wouldn\u2019t have changed sh-t! Instead of being a worrier all your life, be a warrior. Though you should always remember, cash doesn\u2019t avoid death, it only prolongs it. Rich businessmen simply have more choices in life. 9. Don\u2019t read about taking action. Do it. Truthfully, the businessmen best at selling their deals are simply the ones who practice. I know a lot of men equate shooting hoops or tossing a football as practice for being an all-star. Yet, when it comes to practicing for success, well that slips their minds entirely. Before a meeting practice the way you stand, your handshake and so on. Do it for years to come. Now, most men today think buying books and listening to podcasts are steps towards success. In reality, these aren\u2019t! High-performance businessmen take action, they pull the trigger, do the deals, make mistakes and step on their own dick. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019ve read a thousand books, the steps have always been the same: Fail fast, take lots of risks, and fall forward. Bottom line, without risk there\u2019s no glory. Some of the greatest battles would be merely fairy tales had there not been someone willing to take action first. Remember, the bigger the risks you take the greatest the success you see. Ask yourself, is buying books and podcasts risky? No, it\u2019s often stupid is what it is! Don\u2019t get me wrong, even I enjoy a good read now and then. But I don\u2019t let them get in the way of taking action, ever. Understand, if you aren\u2019t experiencing any discomfort or anxiety, the risks you are taking are more than likely not worthy of you. If a risk doesn\u2019t scare you to death, it\u2019s one you\u2019ve outgrown! Super success doesn\u2019t get accomplished by playing it safe and taking risks with a high comfort level. You must always be testing your limits! 10. Make yourself accountable. As I mentioned the drills and lists above, I want you to consider the process. It requires you to be accountable. These things force you to ultimately do what you really don\u2019t want to do, and be what you don\u2019t want to be. As every day passes on, you come to a realization: Either you did them or you didn\u2019t. If you didn\u2019t do them was someone holding a knife to your throat? Was asking out a woman, or pitching a bank for a loan really a life and death situation? Would it have killed you? No. No. No. STOP Blaming your failures on anything or anyone but YOURSELF! Here\u2019s where peer pressure works wonders, especially a mentor because it shames and guilts you into doing things on your list. Think of it like an AA meeting you know. When you\u2019re successful you can\u2019t wait to brag and talk about it. It\u2019s not just YOU that needs to be accountable. Make your children accountable. In fact, make everything in your life accountable! Understand that EVERY minute matters. Time is not something you can simply buy back; it doesn\u2019t work like that! How much time do you waste on Facebook, Twitter, television, etc. every day? If you kept a log for a week, or even a day, I\u2019d bet the number would scare the hell out of you. If it has no part in reaching your goals, it has NO part in your life! Period. Not to mention, all the negative people in your life. Cut them out, make clean breaks. Never give them a hook in which to get back in! 11. You don\u2019t have to be an alpha male The movies have done a great job at making the super successes of this world look like alpha males on the big screen. In reality, the real world isn\u2019t always like that. You have the George Pattons and Donald Trumps on one end, and the Henry Kissingers on the other. Most high-performance businessmen today fall on the second end of the spectrum. 12. Do whatever it takes! Focus. That one word captures everything that defines how to be successful in business. What is truly your definition of commitment? In the real world, dreams aren\u2019t commitments. Any man can envision his future, few follow through with it. Success requires a different level of commitment; aka going the extra mile. It\u2019s either coma or death. It\u2019s what separates the boys from the men, and the billionaires from the millionaires. The successful businessmen of this world are all at the top because they have one thing in common: They are committed. You must be all that you can be, all the time! Period. Good has always been the enemy of great! Remember, what gets measured gets accomplished. Unless you\u2019re dead or in a coma you must perform. Perhaps, it\u2019s better you\u2019re dead if you\u2019re not going to do it. Always act as if you have no limits to your abilities. 13. Develop a system for things that work. It\u2019s okay, as long as it\u2019s honest, ethical, moral, and legal and you\u2019re not hurting anybody. Understand, there are four steps of the action plan you must follow. For short it\u2019s OCMM. The outcome, your desired completion. Commitment, your pay price to action and how much you are willing to sacrifice. Measure, periodically. Modify, change the plan as necessary (Go back and measure the modified plan.) Great companies know how to change operating practices, culture and technologies as needed. Yet, they still are able to retain their purpose and core values. In other words, they adapt. Speaking of which, the number of brick and mortar businesses in this country that still refuse to have a website or give a price quote over the phone is shocking. They\u2019ve essentially given up; they\u2019ve become a bunch of fat cats. However, that doesn\u2019t mean their competition will sit idle waiting for them to catch up. 14. Find something you can\u2019t live without. Don\u2019t start a company selling foot fungus cream, if you hate the subject. Within a few months or a year, you\u2019ll get bored and lose focus. The high-performance businessmen of this world cannot be stopped because they love what they work on so much. They could fail a million times, but their so addicted to the subject, they will always refuse to fail or give up. It\u2019s like dating a woman in the honeymoon phase, you\u2019re hooked! All you can think about is getting her back into your bed, as fast as possible. You can\u2019t get enough of her. The moment you find that in business, go all in! Understand that the super successful men in this world wholeheartedly believe they are genetically encoded for their specific field of endeavor. They don\u2019t need anything else, they are high on life! 15. If someone says no. It\u2019s because you have failed to present to them enough information to make a yes answer. Remember, when the customer says \u201cNo\u201d, that\u2019s when the sales process truly starts. The psychology behind the car dealership industry teaches you a lot of tricks, some manipulative and others not. Yet, I\u2019ve learned thousands over the years. However, here\u2019s my personal favorite: You ask the customer if they are ready to make a purchase on a new vehicle. They say no and provide an excuse. \u201cWe don\u2019t like how it drives.\u201d You then proceed to ask them, \u201cIs there anything else in addition to that?\u201d This time, they mention \u201cNo, that\u2019s it.\u201d At this point, you might assume you\u2019d look foolish asking the same question twice. However, you ignore their response and you ask it again, \u201cIs there anything else in addition to that?\u201d They stare back at you confused, wondering why you just asked the same question. Only, this time, they respond with, \u201cWe really can\u2019t afford it, the down payment is too high.\u201d Now, you know the real reason behind what\u2019s holding them back from making a purchase. Now, you have the opportunity to present new information. It could be an incentive program that lowers the price of the car, another bank with lower interest rates, or a dealer demo that\u2019s the same model with a significant discount. ALL of the things you failed to mention beforehand! The customer could have never, once mentioned their finance issues in the sales process. Remember, there are a lot of different ways to read people. Most importantly, just know that when someone says \u201cNo\u201d, it doesn\u2019t mean the deal is trash! It means you must present new information. There\u2019s no sleaziness about it, it\u2019s simply the art of being a good salesman, and helping your customer discover want meets their means. 16. Be wise and careful about the mentor you pick. Napoleon Hill, the American author on self-success once said, \u201cA human being is like a river, it travels to the path of least resistance.\u201d When it comes to finding a mentor these words ring true. Most businessmen starting out seek out mentorship from people like their uncle or brother, instead of actually searching for the right person. It\u2019s the path of least resistance, it\u2019s straightforward, and it\u2019s less of a knock to your ego and self-esteem. Remember, there\u2019s a higher probability of someone you already know saying \u201cyes\u201d, which is easily tempting. Understand, your mentor must have already obtained the level of success you wish to reach or acquire. If they haven\u2019t, you\u2019re only wasting your time. Remember when I pointed out that you were the average of the five people you spend the most time around with. If your brother has never worked outside of a low-paying 9-5 his entire life, that\u2019s exactly where you\u2019ll end up, and that\u2019s the kind of advice you\u2019ll get! In reality, I know you will be met with gatekeepers. They\u2019ll ask what you want to talk about if you suggest eliminating 25% of all employees. Who\u2019s ever going to let you in? Instead of asking for an appointment, ask their secretary when they\u2019re going to be in town. Honestly gentlemen, you can meet your next mentor outside of their office, at a conference, a restaurant, or even in their own driveway if you park outside of their house overnight. Remember, whatever it takes! When you start looking for a mentor, find one that\u2019s geographically desirable. Think about it as if you were back in high school. Would you rather a date girl who lives in the same city and goes to the same high school as you, or one that lives three hours away, where you can only see her twice a year? You want to make it as EASY as possible to get plenty of face time, as often as possible. Never let the person lose face. 17. Maintain a rock solid relationship with your mentor from the start. Don\u2019t be a \u201cYes\u201d person when you first see them. Just be YOURSELF. Nine out of ten times, mentors will ask you something totally outrageous and off the wall in order to see how YOU respond and comment. If you really want to endear them, start by being completely honest. Try to find something non-business in common with them, build rapport. If you can\u2019t do that with your hobbies, just remember, you can always share a common love of business, success and work ethic to get things done with them. Understand, even the old dogs want recognition. Sure, they don\u2019t have as much energy as the younger guys, yet, they still want to be a part of a successful team. Everyone wants that, old and young, regardless of age. Remember, humans are teachers by nature. Always pick up the tab, I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s his club or you\u2019re dead broke! Call the club beforehand, ask if they allow guests to pay. If yes, leave your credit card with the waiter. When it comes to money, never accept your mentor\u2019s money! Don\u2019t just go to see them when you need something. Everyone does that! When you really need them the most, they will respond. 18. You can never have too much feedback from your mentor. Both ways. Produce a weekly report, comprised of three sections. 1. Your accomplishments for the week. 2. Your accomplishments for the next week. 3. The problems and challenges you face. Never get frustrated if you don\u2019t get the answers you want. Continue to follow their advice and share your progress often. 19. Focus on the few, not the many. You must never let sentimental attachments determine your path of business. Being ruthless is what separates the average business owner and the super successful all-stars. When your goals grow, so do your decisions; both become harder and harder. It\u2019s a fact of life. In reality, you cannot please everyone and take care of everything all at the same time. You must know how to delegate duties and double down on what works. When you are shown terrible ideas, you must never be afraid to say no! Without a response you are giving consent to run with things you know will never work. You are validating a future of continually shooting yourself in the foot. There is no harm in being honest, however, there can be a great deal of pain when you let others decide things for you. Remember, if you want to be successful in business, it requires a team with a crystal clear sense of vision and impact. 20. Stop seeking constant approval from others. Do what you want, because you want to be the best. Disregard what others think. Don\u2019t seek approval from your parents like most men do when it comes to their life decisions. You don\u2019t need a nod of approval from your father to start a business or make a financial deal. Your mother shouldn\u2019t be giving you the okay to sign off a paper contract when it comes to selling your company. Your parents don\u2019t need to hear about your first sale. You\u2019d be amazed at how many small things men bring up while secretly seeking the approval from others. Remember, approval doesn\u2019t mean advice. Building your dream team, hire the best lawyers, accountants, etc. is critically important! If you truly want to know if you\u2019re business is worthy of lasting ask yourself one simple question, \u201cDoes my company stand for something great to someone?\u201d 21. Never miss a meeting. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s your birthday, a holiday, your anniversary, or a day before your wedding. If you were in a car accident and broke your leg, drag it to the board room. If a meeting is requested or scheduled, you make it. Period! Never complain about the date or time, or how inconvenient it was for you. Get the idea of being polite of out your head, it\u2019s all about having mental discipline. It goes right back to being accountable and being committed. 22. Time matters more than money. Most businessmen today drastically underestimate the value of time. Instead of thinking in terms of ROI, return on investment, start thinking in terms of ROM, and return on minutes. 23. Be a strong leader and a constant student. Great leaders make sense of change in the world, and proceed to share that insight with their team. You are paid in life for what you can get others to do for you. You don\u2019t have to be the smartest individual in the room, in fact, you could start a business in a field you know absolutely nothing about. Your job as a leader is to attract smart employees to work for you! Remember, the brainpower of the group will always trump that of just one individual. Though, you should never stop trying to become qualified for the job. Be a macro manager, where less control equals more control. 24. Get great people on your bus. It doesn\u2019t matter what business you\u2019re in, all that matters is who you do it with. Most businesses end up morphing into other industries while starting out. Sure, they hadn\u2019t planned on being in them in the first place, however, their success all starts with one thing: They all picked great people to do it with. When you build your dream team, the people on your bus shouldn\u2019t be focused on where you\u2019re going. In reality, they should be on your bus because they like who\u2019s riding along with them! Put them all through a doofus test. Stress them and judge their reaction to pressure when being a high-performance person is demanded of them. When you have big problems, put your best people on them; you will be confident in doing so. 25. Choose your battles. Don\u2019t sue over every small matter of wrongdoing. Large lawsuits are better than the minor ones. When warranted, choose your venue and choose to be the plaintiff. In some cases, this won\u2019t be possible however, you should still play the part. That means to prepare for trial, don\u2019t fear it or be intimidated by the process. Use mock trials to your advantage. Bring your wife to the front row every day, children as well, if allowed, and other members of your family in the second row. You want them to know what you\u2019re going through. Hire the best representation, it goes back to building your dream team; don\u2019t worry about the cost. If you have a better strategy in mind, it\u2019s time to find a new lawyer. If you find a team that consistently wins, stay with them. It\u2019s hard trying to get new lawyers on your team up to speed; avoid changes when possible. Remember to keep in close contact with your lawyer, preferably once a month. Don\u2019t let them disappear to handle everything. Elect for jury trials rather than a judge only. You shouldn\u2019t be afraid to trust your fellow citizens. To show respect for the judge and jury, dress conservatively. That means a white shirt, simple tie, dark suit and no jewelry other than your wedding band. When it comes to recorded videos in court and in depositions, look at the camera. The same is true for the jury and judge, make eye constant. If you don\u2019t know the answer to a question, never guess. Say you don\u2019t know. Remember, honesty is key! Don\u2019t lose your temper in court, however, if authentic emotion is fine. Never talk in public about the case, regardless of where you are at, someone may very well overhear your conversation. That includes press, who may misinterpret your words while in a hurry. If you chose to make a statement, \u201cWe believe in our case, and that is why we went to court,\u201d is enough. 26. Perfection equals paralysis. Don\u2019t waste time on things you cannot change. Truthfully, it\u2019s really easy to fall into the trap of working on things that don\u2019t matter. You could spend an entire year putting together the perfect business plan, only to see it fail after being put in action. Even small things like picking out the right font, color, messaging, etc. on a simple brochure can be a major time suck. When in doubt, trust your gut; don\u2019t delay if you don\u2019t have to. A good plan today is always better than a great plan you execute next week. By then, well, it just might be too late. Remember, your gut is your most valuable asset, don\u2019t just ignore it. The truth is, conventional wisdom is almost always wrong in the first place. 27. Every problem solved will eventually be replaced by a much larger one. Never underestimate how wrong you can be. Even with careful planning, external circumstances and events can create chaos. Super successful businessmen live for that kind chaos, it\u2019s what fuels the fire in their bellies. Understand that progress often masquerades itself as trouble. Never opt for the easy, Band-Aid solution; it will eventually peel off. Short term solutions don\u2019t work for long-term problems, regardless of how alluring they may appear. Instant gratification can get in the way of your goals, avoid that. 28. Being a super successful businessman is NOT for every man. I don\u2019t care what the gurus and coaches tell you. Most of them made money putting asses in seminar seats and pushing book sales, NOT in business. But boy will they sell you on a dream they couldn\u2019t even acquire own their own. They love to pump out misinformation which gives you no chance to succeed. Let\u2019s face it, most men are today are TOO weak. A strong drink and a good f-ck would kill most them. You\u2019re not going to work 4 hours a week, you\u2019re going to work 120. You\u2019re not going to be sipping mojitos and napping at the beach, you\u2019re going to sleep in the office! Understand that it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re working 12 hours a day, you could be \u201cbusy\u201d for 12 hours a day in reality. There\u2019s a difference between working smart and staying busy. 29. Kiss a lot of frogs. Life is a numbers game, regardless if you\u2019re asking out women or trying to acquire financing. If you want to see success you must always be kissing frogs! Twenty women may turn down your request to take them home for the night, but the twenty-first woman may very well agree. Yet, most men can\u2019t take that kind of hit to their ego or emotional bank account! In business, you\u2019ll be met with calls that are hung up on you, abusive call backs, and flat out refusals to talk. What divides the men from the boys is persistence and focus. Very few are willing to make a thousand phone calls when it comes to getting financing. After a handful of rejections, most men quit. They proclaim, \u201cI can\u2019t get financing\u201d, \u201cNo one will invest in my idea\u201d, etc. ALL of them, excuses! There is a sucker out there who will invest in anything, including your idea, but only if you take the time to find them first. 30. Expand in a down cycle. Double your work effort when times are difficult. Tough times don\u2019t last, tough businessmen do. It\u2019s a reminder of what Henry Ford once said, \u201cA man who stops advertising to save money is like a man who stops a clock to save time.\u201d This is especially true when it comes to economic times of recessions and depressions. When the stock market falls, you won\u2019t see Warren Buffett jumping ship. Yet, the rest of the world believes this may really be the end. Meanwhile, he\u2019s buying up everything in sight with the utmost confidence. Understand that building wealth at the levels most men can never fathom about, means buying small companies, rolling them into one, puffing your company up like a fat hog, and selling it at the market. When you stop expanding, so does your success. Take for instance this very moment, interest rates are incredibly low. Banks are flush with cash, literally waiting for you to come and take it. It reminds me of the housing crash years ago. Fast-forward in time, and you\u2019ll see Buffet again, ready to buy bulk real estate when others are still uneasy over the thought of it. 31. Pay yourself and your employees first. That includes through all economic cycles. Share your wealth with your dream team, do it with cash, equity, options or wants that are tangible rewards for performance and loyalty. Pull cash out the company, enjoy the lifestyle you and your family have earned. Most business owners today work their entire lives at one place, waiting for the day they can \u201ccash out\u201d. When the time comes, they are shocked. They discover the market isn\u2019t willing to pay what they had planned to sell off at. Remember, it doesn\u2019t matter how much YOU value your company, what matters if how much someone else is willing to ultimately pay for it! If you are over 40 and in an upmarket, sell your business. You might not be around long enough to see another one. 32. Know how to negotiate. Define the boundaries of the other parties\u2019 comfort zone. Place the deal inside of them nearest to your own interests. Remember, a deal has to sound good before it is good! Respect the gentleman on the other side of the table. He\u2019s not as stupid as you may believe, and you\u2019re not as clever as you think! 33. All ideas are worthless until put into action You are standing in your own acres of diamonds. I\u2019m talking about your mind here. It churns out ideas, day after day. But if you aren\u2019t willing to dig for them, their worthless. It doesn\u2019t matter what you invent, figure out, or what mystery of the world you unlock. If you don\u2019t file for a patent, your competitor will. If you don\u2019t pitch your idea in order to get financing, someone else will get the money, and your product will never reach the shelves at the store. If you don\u2019t write down your idea with the goal of making it a reality, it will NEVER happen. On the other end of the spectrum here, even the most bizarre of ideas can often be profitable. Who would have ever thought pet rocks or even the plastic grocery bag with the smile on it, could be multi-million dollar ideas in reality? The people who took action did, and guess what, they succeeded. Can you imagine how many people called them crazy in the process? How many times they got rejected and ridiculed? It\u2019s truly a shame most men give up on great ideas because they are either too embarrassed, afraid or unmotivated. 34. Go from idea to execution the right way. Identify the idea. It could be expanding your revenue or forming a new joint venture partner and so on. Investigate. Then investigate again to see if it is what you think it is. The second time, use different people from within your organization. Commit to the idea. If you\u2019re not obsessed with it, no one else will be. In that scenario, sh-t can it! Share the obsession and start living it. Discuss how great it will be, how great it will be for America, for whatever. You live it and you breathe it, and you share it with others. Don\u2019t talk about anything else, period! It becomes your whole life. Walk the talk. Never share your doubts with anyone, ever! Not your wife, mistress, etc. regardless if it eats you up inside or make you an insomniac at night. You WILL have a lot of doubts, however, you must be a bulldog. The moment you say, \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to work\u201d, the deal is DEAD. It\u2019s over, it has fallen apart. Put together a critical path. Your team of decision makers will do this, not you! They are the ones who are going to have to implement and execute it. If they don\u2019t get it accomplished, you are the one who puts their heads on a pole. Stay out of it! Create a detailed timeline. Continually measure every single thing. You don\u2019t measure it, they do. Your other decision-makers will implement the plan. They keep focused and follow up at subordinate levels. This is the grunt work, the real work. Focus follow up at the decision maker level. Execution. It means laser beam focus without deviation and no blinders. You lead from the front, it is the only thing in your life. Never second-guess your subordinates, as they will make mistakes at all levels and lots of them. Only step in and override when you believe it will take down the company. People must be given permission to make mistakes, it\u2019s the only way they can grow exponentially. Reevaluate and start all over again. 35. Conventional wisdom is almost always wrong. You can\u2019t do that\u2026 You will hear those words a million times! It comes in many different forms. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst recession ever, you can\u2019t get a loan.\u201d You can\u2019t get financing if you have bad credit.\u201d The most obvious rationale given to you will almost always be wrong. The truth is, it\u2019s extremely difficult when you\u2019re starting out to overlook the obvious and go against all conventional wisdom; it\u2019s near impossible. However, you MUST remain focused on the positive. Talk about the positive, never the times you weren\u2019t successful. Keep your eyes set far down the road. 36. Always investigate people before you go into business with them. Assume people are honest and that they will deal with you fairly. When you discover they are not, the rules change entirely. You can investigate at either the beginning or the end, though, if you\u2019re uncomfortable do it at the start. Spend a few thousand dollars to see if that person is no good. Hire real investigators. Every penny you spend will be worth it. Period. For instance, if you are doing a $5 million dollar joint venture with a partner, spending $10,000 is a drop in bucket; it\u2019s cheap! 37. Establish a line of credit. Contrary to popular belief, credit cards are NOT a line of credit A fourteen-year-old child can have an American Express card. Any moron on the face of the planet can get one. If you feel proud because you have one, you\u2019re an idiot! You must start thinking in terms of fishing with nets, not lines. Doing thirty deals and closing multiple houses, instead of buying one at a time. Most refuse to do twenty or thirty deals at a time because they are afraid of what happens when more than one gets approved. 38. You don\u2019t need a business plan to get financed. Never go into a bank with a business plan. On the first meeting, you must show up with nothing. No papers! Ask the financial banker for a copy of a proposal that has been OK\u2019d and approved by the bank. Tell them to redact and black out the names. They\u2019ll give you a business plan that works, and you don\u2019t even have to write one. Remember, business plans are NOT set in stone, at best there are wild ass guesses. The same is true for when you estimate how much financial cash you will need. 39. When you borrow money, borrow big bucks. If you need ten thousand, borrow fifty! Always borrow more than you believe you will need. In all honesty, you never truly know what the number will be, you\u2019re only assuming. Understand that you\u2019re not doing anything wrong here. When it comes to 1, 3 or 5 over prime, it should NOT make a difference in your deal. If it does not pencil out, your deal is too tight and it\u2019s no damn good! Expect there to be a margin for errors and mistakes. 40. It\u2019s not that money you\u2019ve got to worry about, it\u2019s the deal! In reality, banks today are flush with cash. The only problem is, most men aren\u2019t smart enough to get off their ass and actually go get it. You don\u2019t have money for your projects because you don\u2019t ask for it! And you don\u2019t ask for it because you don\u2019t wholeheartedly believe in it enough. And if you don\u2019t believe in it enough, the bank knows it and so do you. And that\u2019s why you don\u2019t ask them because let\u2019s face it, you already know exactly what they\u2019re going to say! Without any enthusiasm, your chances are next to ZERO. Remember the most beautiful woman at your school, the one you never asked out? It\u2019s no different! 41. Bad credit and all other excuses are not valid. It\u2019s true bankers are more inclined to lend you money when you have a track record. The same can be said for your credit rating. They lend to people who have had a successful chain of transitions. If you have none of these, you need to partner with someone who does. Past the first transition, even if you give up most of your equity, it will be worth it. That track record will carry over to second, third and so on. Understand, that having your mother in law or father in law on the deal with you can be a red flag to bankers. More than one last name across the page is always the better option. When you\u2019re looking for banks, keep an eye of for two that have just merged. If there\u2019s a new bank in town, set up a tent outside their front door. Also remember, there ARE financial institutions out of this country that require none of the above. It\u2019s YOUR job to go to them, even if means hunting for cheap flights or riding on a boat! The US is not the only financial playground in the world. Of course, it\u2019s also perfectly fine to shop for a deal. More than six credit checks on your report is not a big thing! When it comes to angels, aka the old man with money who will fund your project. Expect a GREAT one to take 85-95% of your deal and throw your ass out within 1 year if you can\u2019t deliver as the CEO or boss. While you might think you can manage, the truth is most can\u2019t! Finding angels is no difficult, it\u2019s only difficult but you never ask. If possible, position yourself properly by using audited financials. You\u2019ll double your chances of approval. When they\u2019re from a big fix firm, you can expect that to be even 25% higher. Remember, you must be willing to put your neck out on the line. If you won\u2019t, why should a banker? You are the one running the company, not them! Roll your financial worth if you have to. Aside from bankers, you have other options. Owner financing for one. For instance, a man may have run his business for fifty years, and now he\u2019s watching his wife caught up blood at the hospital. He wants out, FAST! Let\u2019s face it, there are plenty of opportunities out there, however, you must look for them and ask first! 42. Success in selling is smiling and dialing. When pitching for funding, you\u2019ll be met with an emotional hurdle! Think of yourself as a concept salesman. It doesn\u2019t have to feel sleazy like being a used car salesman or the guy that sells encyclopedias at your front door step. You must practice! Do so for two to three hours before a presentation, you will be a thousand times more at ease. You must sell your vision with clarity. The banker has to feel like you\u2019ll do WHATEVER it takes to pay back the money. That passion needs to be crystal clear! 43. Know how to deal with bankers. You want to work with a banker who can make a decision, NOT one that will waste your time. Ask them, \u201cWhat is the lending limit of your bank?\u201d Immediately, you will separate yourself from 99% of the other people he\u2019s ever talked to. When he responds, ask, \u201cSecured or unsecured limit?\u201d When you have that information, ask, \u201cWhat is your lending limit?\u201d By that I mean, the amount he doesn\u2019t need a sign off from mommy or his superior for. If his limit is $25,000 you ask for $24,950. If he can\u2019t make a credit decision himself, you don\u2019t want to talk to him. If you must talk to a committee of two, make sure both of them are present at the same time. If it\u2019s more than two, find another bank! Before stepping a foot in the door, call and set up the interview, ask to speak with the senior leading office. \u201cThis is Brian Cornwell, is your bank in a lending mode right now?\u201d You don\u2019t want so to invest time only to find out the FDIC is closing the bank down next month. If they ask why, respond, \u201cI\u2019m looking for a new financial relationship.\u201d Remember, it is always better to have an assistant set up your interviews for you when possible. What you are really doing here is simply qualifying the bank. 44. When interviewing banks and financial intuitions don\u2019t: NEVER mention that you are looking to borrow money. That\u2019s what 99% of the people who walk into banks today say. And you know what, it reeks of desperation! Always mention that you are looking to establish a new financial relationship. Be a bum and walk around with your hat in your hand. YOU are in control; YOU are driving the show here. Avoid appearing nervous, it will affect your ability to pitch your deal with confidence. Again, it goes right back to the practice bit. You must rehearse beforehand. 45. Consolidate fragmented industries. Let\u2019s face it, starting from scratch with a brand new business takes years and years of hard, dedicated work. Even then, you\u2019re looking on average at roughly 3 to 5% profit margins. However, when you build groups of enterprise through acquisitions, the rewards are exponential and the time frame is considerably short. Aim to generate a combined value in this group. Achieve a synergy by which that bottom-line value is far superior to the sum of the individual operations. Think in terms of Unilever, Time Warner Cable, General Motors, US Steel and so on. Remember, real wealth is the result of repeated acquisition, sale and/or IP of businesses. 46. When it comes to purchasing, the majority of the choice stems from emotion. If there\u2019s one thing car dealerships are really good at it, it\u2019s using this statement above to their advantage. They know the moment you test drive a new vehicle off the lot, you will more than often, fall in love with it. However, it doesn\u2019t matter what you\u2019re selling, the rule applies for unloading a business as well. Assume a potential buyer visits your location. They will see everything from the dirty carpet to the cluttered receptionist desk. They will notice how loud your employees are alongside the awards you have hung up on the wall. (It\u2019s a good reason why franchises in the dealer world have STRICT showroom guidelines. I mean, fine tooth comb strict.) You MUST puff up the hog. 47. The market decides how much your business is worth. Not you! There\u2019s the market comparison approach, the asset approach, gross revenue approach, and the here\u2019s how much I\u2019m willing to pay approach. Most buyers will request three years of records. While you may supply your projections, no one is going to believe you. Buyers will do their own research and make their OWN projections. Of which, they\u2019ll base the valuation off of. 48. Don\u2019t become a fat cat. Most of the successful businessmen and leaders you see today were once like you. They were bold, determined and ruthless to accomplish their dreams. After their first success, they stopped and decided it was time to play it safe. In other words, they practically retire early. They might wait for their sons to take over their company after they die. Remember, you can\u2019t cling onto your past successes like a teddy bear. You MUST repeat the process over and over again. Interestingly enough, on the other end of the spectrum, you have the businessmen who become rich, yet, felt they didn\u2019t ultimately deserve it. What happens is they usually end up going broke. 49. You must sell the seller on you. It\u2019s not uncommon to find business owners who are VERY protective over their company. It\u2019s pretty apparent when you hear people talking about the \u201cBRAND\u201d over and over. (I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve come across people who are so focused on the \u201cbrand\u201d they put business completely aside. It\u2019s amazing\u2026) They want to know their baby is going to be in good hands with you. They\u2019ll ask who you are and ask how you will run the company. To answer these questions, you NEED credibility. Having your accountant or lawyer make the first call will do that. If you insist on calling yourself, give references to the two above. It will satisfy their due diligence. Of course, you can also include these in a letter as well. 50. Start today. If you do not take action with the next 24 hours, you NEVER will. Time flies; you could be in your twenties or thirties this very moment. The next thing you know, you\u2019ll be in your sixties and seventies. All within the blink of an eye. Don\u2019t wait until it\u2019s too late, because that time WILL come. You need nothing more than a cell phone and a notebook. It doesn\u2019t matter if your dead broke or haven\u2019t worked a day in your miserable life! The only thing holding you back from reaching the level of super success you desire is quite simply, YOU! Accept that life isn\u2019t fair, stop being weak and start taking action. Period. ",

            "answer_text": "My older daughter decided she wanted to become rich at an early age. She studied how rich people became rich. My daughter has a unique situation that limited the paths she could take to her goal. She has cerebral palsy, spastic quadriplegia, and can\u2019t talk and walk, and has limited use of her hands, so she picked a path that was with-in her limitations. Nine years ago, she decided to follow Warren Buffet\u2019s method of becoming a millionaire because his method was with-in her limitations. Prior to following Warren Buffet\u2019s path in investing, she got lucky and invested in something else. Her credit union had CDs that had a 14% return. She bought a bunch of those. After they matured, she bought silver at $14 an ounce. With-in a few months, sliver jumped to over $56 an ounce. As soon as it hit $56 an ounce, she sold. She then took the money and bought stock in several companies that paid dividends. She then rolled the dividends back into buying more stocks. More stocks she had, more dividends was paid. More dividends that were paid, more she bought. Starting with the CDs, she started with $1,000. Now she has over $510,000. She discovered it took Warren Buffet 18 years to earn his first million. She\u2019s trying to beat that. During this journey to becoming a millionaire, my daughter decided she wanted to give back. She has a scholarship for students that do not have the education level to permit them to attend college level classes. If you are not at a college level upon enrolling college, you don\u2019t qualify for most scholarships. My daughter wanted to provide a bridge for these students so they can get their scholarships. The students that she focuses on are mostly in alternative schools who are from low income and at risk families. My daughter feels these are the students who need the financial help the most. The reason I brought this up is because she wants to eventually be able to provide large enough scholarship so these students can focus on their studies instead of giving up and quitting to settle on a non-living wage job. In a nutshell, study how the rich got rich. Find a method that you can do and do well. Focus on your goal and don\u2019t give up. You won\u2019t get rich overnight, but you can eventually get there if you try and keep focus. Remember this story because, if someone who can\u2019t walk or talk can succeed, what\u2019s keeping you? Opportunities are there. You just have to watch for them and be ready to exploit them. One more thing\u2026 Give back or give forward; You\u2019ll find the returns are greater than the investment. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve answered this question before, but here are three pretty fool-proof steps: Get a Career. Learn a skill that pays half-way decent, such as becoming an engineer, master tradesman, doctor, lawyer, or business man.Live beneath your means. Live on half your income (after taxes). Save a lot of money (for example, saving $30\u201340k/year).Invest. Investing is how you make the big bucks. Let your assets work for you. Typical investments include liquid things like stocks and bonds as well as illiquid investments like real estate and businesses. You want to diversify and become educated on investing strategies.Following this plan has been the primary means of wealth building historically. After 30 years following this pattern, you are very likely to be economically well off, and it doesn\u2019t require subscribing to some kind of get-rich-quick scheme or other such nonsense. Want to become mega-rich? (think $100M+). That almost always requires starting and growing a large business. It isn\u2019t a repeatable pattern because it requires a little luck and a lot of skills to achieve. However, being average-rich (think $1M-10M) can be achieved following the plan I listed above pretty consistently by just about anybody willing to put forth the work and make the sacrifices. Edit: I should also mention that the strategies in \u201cbeing average rich\u201d are a great lead-in to becoming mega-rich. Basically, when you have a career and some savings, it positions you well to recognize and take hold of opportunities in life. As Louis Pasteur used to say, \u201cchance favors the prepared mind.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "To become rich, you first need to know what \u201cbeing rich\u201d is. I\u2019ll bet you don\u2019t know, because most of us have no idea at all. But that\u2019s okay. If you\u2019re looking to become rich, I can only assume that you\u2019re not rich now. So what you\u2019re trying to figure out is an easy way to change that by becoming rich. But there\u2019s a big gap of information here\u2026 how do you define being \u201crich\u201d? This is not a philosophical, \u201cyou don\u2019t really need money\u201d type of answer. This is a serious, objective, capitalist-style answer that is pressing you for an actual number. How much money do you need in order to be \u201crich\u201d? Let\u2019s hold that thought for a second and look at these water bottles (which are 1000 ml, 500 ml, and 250 ml)\u2026  What all of these bottles do have in common is that they\u2019re full. What all of these bottles do not have in common is that they\u2019re different sizes. As such, they will require different amounts of water in order to be considered \u201cfull\u201d. Is 250 ml enough to make a bottle \u201cfull\u201d? For a 250 ml bottle, yes it is, because that\u2019s all it needs. For a 500 ml bottle, no it\u2019s not, because it needs more than that. From this, we know that being \u201cfull\u201d is not a question of how much should be given\u2026 but rather, it is a question of how much is required. In what is very much the same way, \u201crich\u201d is not a question of how much money you should make/have\u2026 but rather, it is a question of how much money you are required to make/have. For the bottle, how much it needs to be \u201cfull\u201d is easy to determine because the capacity is printed right on the label. For you, how much you need to be \u201crich\u201d is not nearly as easy to determine because we don\u2019t know how much you need. Do you need $500,000 in net worth? $5 million? $50 million? That answer is up to you to determine, and it relies completely on both your circumstances and your goals. The bottle already has this figured out. It just needs 250 ml of water and it\u2019s all set. Your life, however, is a bit more complicated. Therefore, you first need to set out to determine just what you need in order to be rich. Once you have an idea of that number, that is your goal. Once you have your goal, then you can figure out how you\u2019ll get there. To simply ask \u201cwhat is the easiest way to become rich?\u201d is basically the same thing as asking someone for directions by saying \u201chow do I get there?\u201d. Where?! It\u2019s not possible to give directions to go somewhere, when you don\u2019t know where that place is. In the same way, it\u2019s not possible to tell you the easiest way to build up a certain sum of money when you don\u2019t know how much money you need! You\u2019re trying to find step one. But in reality, what you need is step zero. Know how much you need, and build your plan based on that. Without this information, you\u2019re basically pouring water into a bottomless bottle. No matter how much you can put into it, it will never be \u201cfull\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "I share 10 steps that will make you rich: 1. Follow the money. In today's economic environment you cannot earn millionaire status. The first step is to focus on increasing your income in increments and repeating that. My income was $ 3,000 a month and nine years later it was $ 20,000 a month. Start following the money and that will force you to control your income and see opportunities. 2. Don't brag, show up for work. I didn't buy my first luxury watch or car until my businesses and investments were producing multiple safe streams of income. I was still driving a Toyota Camry when I became a millionaire. Be recognized for your work ethic , not for the things you buy. 3. Save to invest, don't save to save. The only reason to save money is to invest it later. Put it in a safe and untouchable account. Never use these accounts, even for an emergency. This will force you to follow step one (follow the money). Today, at least twice a year, I am bankrupt because I always invest my surpluses in companies that I cannot get into. 4. Avoid debts that do not pay you. I borrowed money for a car just because I knew it could increase my income. Rich people use debt to leverage investments and grow their cash flows. Poor people use debt to buy things that make the rich richer. 5. Treat money like a jealous lover. Millions of people want economic freedom, but only those who make it a priority have millions. To be rich and stay that way you have to make it your priority. If you ignore it, it will ignore you or worse, it will leave you for someone who does take it as a priority. 6. Money does not sleep. Money doesn't know clocks, schedules, or vacations, and neither should you. Money loves people who have a work ethic. When I was 26 I was in retail and the store I worked in closed at 7 pm Many times you could find me there at 11 pm selling something else. Never try to be the smartest or the luckiest person, just make sure you work harder than everyone else. 7. Being poor doesn't make sense. I've been poor and it sucks. I had enough and that too sucked. Eliminate all ideas that being poor is somehow okay. Bill Gates said \u201cIf you are born poor, it is not your mistake. But if you die poor, it's your fault. \" 8. Find a millionaire mentor. Most of us grew up in a poor or middle class and we limit ourselves to the ideas of one group . I have studied millionaires to duplicate what they did. Find your personal mentor and study it. Most rich people are very generous with their knowledge and resources. 9. Make your money lift the heavy stuff. Investing is the Holy Grail to becoming a millionaire and you should make more money from your investments than from your work. If you do not have extra money you will not make investments. The second company I started required an investment of $ 50,000. That company has given me that same amount back every month for the last ten years. My third investment was in real estate, where I started with 350 thousand, a big chunk of what I had at the time. I still own that property and it continues to give me income. Investing is the only reason to do the other steps and your money should work for you and lift the heavy stuff. 10. Aim for 10 million, not 1 million. The biggest financial mistake I've made was not thinking big. There is no shortage of money on this planet, just a shortage of people who don't think big. If you are interested.

            "answer_text": "Bit of a long reply but: One day a fisherman was lying on a beautiful beach, with his fishing pole propped up in the sand and his solitary line cast out into the sparkling blue surf. He was enjoying the warmth of the afternoon sun and the prospect of catching a fish. About that time, a businessman came walking down the beach trying to relieve some of the stress of his workday. He noticed the fisherman sitting on the beach and decided to find out why this fisherman was fishing instead of working harder to make a living for himself and his family. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to catch many fish that way,\u201d said the businessman. \u201cYou should be working rather than lying on the beach!\u201d The fisherman looked up at the businessman, smiled and replied, \u201cAnd what will my reward be?\u201d \u201cWell, you can get bigger nets and catch more fish!\u201d was the businessman\u2019s answer. \u201cAnd then what will my reward be?\u201d asked the fisherman, still smiling. The businessman replied, \u201cYou will make money and you\u2019ll be able to buy a boat, which will then result in larger catches of fish!\u201d \u201cAnd then what will my reward be?\u201d asked the fisherman again. The businessman was beginning to get a little irritated with the fisherman\u2019s questions. \u201cYou can buy a bigger boat, and hire some people to work for you!\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then what will my reward be?\u201d repeated the fisherman. The businessman was getting angry. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand? You can build up a fleet of fishing boats, sail all over the world, and let all your employees catch fish for you!\u201d Once again the fisherman asked, \u201cAnd then what will my reward be?\u201d The businessman was red with rage and shouted at the fisherman, \u201cDon\u2019t you understand that you can become so rich that you will never have to work for your living again! You can spend all the rest of your days sitting on this beach, looking at the sunset. You won\u2019t have a care in the world!\u201d The fisherman, still smiling, looked up and said, \u201cAnd what do you think I\u2019m doing right now?\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "First, Lenny\u2019s answer is more right than you may give it credit for. If you do ever become rich monetarily, you may find that money really means very little to your day to day happiness. My answer is cliche. Work hard in a smart way.Get lucky.Most answers focus on and stop with number 1, which is important, but I want to focus on getting lucky. Being lucky is somewhat evasive, but not entirely. The trick is to increase your luck. It includes things like being careful where you go, who you cavort with, following simple safety rules, avoiding health damaging drugs, foods, getting rest and exercise. It means improving your knowledge base, your unique skillset. Luck increases when we respect others, forgive them, and help them. That is the the law of reciprocity, and it will save you more times than not. It also means spending less than you make, and investing a large percentage of what you don\u2019t spend. When you are investing, you will learn by expensive experience, what not to invest in. And then, if you ever get the \u2018entrepreneur\u2019 bug, you will be able to more accurately judge whether you should invest in your own business. These are the kinds of things that increase luck. And while others will think you are just really lucky, you will have learned that luck is more of a creative exercise than a game of chance. At the same time, you will meet truly unlucky people along the way, people who had no chance at all, and you will be humbled by how incredibly lucky you were, and hopefully, you will feel compassion and be in a position to help them become a little more lucky because of it.

            "answer_text": "My wife and I first lived in an apartment in a bad part of town that\u2019s now a highway overpass. I graduated from grad school and went into a family business. Never saw the coming train wreck. We had a few good years then nearly went bankrupt when the economy collapsed. I pastored a church, which was long on personal rewards and short on financial ones. Thankfully, I invested well during the good years to survive the drought years. I started my current financial consulting practice with nothing and struggled for three years just to survive. Not exactly a get rich quick story that sells millions. Yet, through it all I carried a vision of the wealth I wanted. And somehow, even when sucking pond water, I knew we\u2019d get there. I never cared about being the 1%, whatever the hell that means. I just wanted to build enough wealth I could take care of my family comfortably. Not worry if we\u2019d run out of money before we ran out of month. Help organizations trying to make a difference in people\u2019s lives. And be able to spend time using my life strategically to help others. That vision kept me riveted to my financial dream. And guided us through all the detours and wash outs. Recently, my wife and I were driving to the coast to see our daughter. Driving through the midst of the vineyard lands, in the afternoon, I reflected on our life. I said, \u201cI\u2019m still amazed at the wealth we have when I think about our journey.\u201d She replied, \u201cWe\u2019ve been blessed.\u201d \u201cYes, that and we\u2019ve worked our asses off,\u201d I said laughing. She smiled, putting up with me yet again. Picture the wealth you truly need and passionately want. And someday you\u2019ll be surprised. ",

            "answer_text": "You have to come a long way from going with the flow and not thinking at all to possibly doing things you hate or even cannot afford to do. Research, constant study, college, cold marketing, outsourcing tasks and projects, being creative in the way you think because you\u2019re going to have to build something, and you might have to liken yourself to that. If you\u2019re like me, you don\u2019t know what those people making billions of dollars are making, you get stuck sometimes reading articles about how teachers are constantly broke and relate that to the longevity of financial turmoil in your near future: how do you connect the dots from things like that to how people end up building billion dollar companies from scratch and with ease like Elon Musk? What if a teacher had worked in retail and tried working upwards from there, or finance? Why can\u2019t a teacher climb up the hierarchy from there? Those positions that are higher paying and top tier exist in the schooling industry too, and maybe they can use that acumen to get better jobs too. Now you have to get people to work for you and build the product for you, and build the marketing products for you to succeed: that\u2019s all stuff that is extra difficult to know how to do, I mean you will use manufacturing plants and chemicals to build the products and marketing products themselves, of course once a business is successful and off of the ground, you don\u2019t think about the warehousing anymore, it is generating compound interest for you now. Obviously if you startup and try a million times, it isn\u2019t time to give up. The most difficult part of the problem is getting rid of people who think they\u2019re a part of your personal life now that you\u2019re trying to get a buzz in business: those are people who think that they know what\u2019s best for you: it\u2019s bullshit. Everyone around you will always want a piece of the pie: teach people to stop being fucking lazy and get a fucking clue, that might give them a taste of their own medicine. Try constantly writing, it can change the way that you think, and meeting a lot of new people can be critical to your success. Unfortunately, when you stray away from family too much, shit gets messy too: who knows how bitter the things trying you and your family together truly are or aren\u2019t! We\u2019re all different. You\u2019ll be so surprised when you stop and analyze with common sense how unsuccessful most of us who try working as many hours as we can a week are in terms of what you\u2019re looking for: you want to be the next Elon Musk. It\u2019s just not easy! You don\u2019t know how to build technology, and it\u2019s going to take a lot of difficult effort to get your fundraising off of the ground, and then your start up off the ground, and then get teams to build products that sell for you, and you have to familiarize yourself with who you\u2019ll be selling to. I don\u2019t know what product you could sell that isn\u2019t already in the media like Apple, Dell, etc. Most startups probably sell software and hardware that exist within the technologies those companies sell. Apart from properties, most companies are trying to make a ton of money by coming up with a big idea, because the obstacle behind building a company comes from the idea that we currently don\u2019t need anything or know what we need; so obviously the highest problem solvers in society are the people who are going to cash out when or if they can execute those ideas successfully. Then they spend the rest of their lives trying to do those things a million times or sell their writing, and both a lot of times. That\u2019s what the great value that lies behind a company is, it\u2019s the fact that a company will solve a problem within an industry: problems are that expensive to find in a plethora of meaningful plethoras.

            "answer_text": "I devised these concept base on my understanding of wealth. I will share to you some pointers. Understanding the value of moneyThere are lots of books that talks about this and thousands of good suggestions that can be learned. However, I made this as a shortcut for you to understand clearly. Why we are talking the value of money? of course without this you would never acquire anything. So understanding its value will reflect your personal lifestyle and choice. It\u2019s your foundation of wealth. A mere example is that, it\u2019s impossible for you to be wealthy if you are spending more than you are earning. This is my MY FIRST PRINCIPLE. So therefore, my rule is I save more and spend less. 2. Identifying my needs and wants I always make a distinction. Do I really need this or just want this? You should always follow this principle. For example, why buy a Ferrari to be used as vehicle to run errands? Does this serve the purpose or I just want to look awesome? I am not telling you not to buy the luxury car because I will be discussing that one on the later part. 3. Understanding Investments When you purchase something let say a truck, do you really need that equipment? If you purchase that to serve you for transport and of course to generate another income, then go buy a truck. Have this in your mind, this is MY THIRD PRINCIPLE. when I purchase things, I always visualize its usefulness to help me generate more income. A wealth generation strategy. 4. Having Multiples My FOURTH PRINCIPLE, I don\u2019t rely on one income, I always look for ways to earn money no matter how small the profit is. When combined with my other businesses, it\u2019s something. 5. The Sudden Reaction Concept My FIFTH PRINCIPLE. This is my attitude, unfortunately many will disagree with me. Do you believe that the FIRST ONE TO ARRIVE CATCHES THE BIGGEST WORMS? I always make it a habit to be the first to touch base my projected market. While my competitors are still day dreaming on what to do, I am ahead of giving something to the consumers that has value for their bucks. 6. Enjoying My Spoils Remember the Ferrari that I mentioned on my second principle? Yes, wealth are created to be enjoyed and not to be kept on a vault or some unknown places. The first five principles are the obstacles you need to pass before getting your wealth. Its impractical for you to buy that car while you are creating your riches right? So this LAST PRINCIPLE is my pinnacle of wealth. The stages you passed were your pipelines. Consider this example, one day while digging a well from your land, you accidentally struck an oil reserve, now the problem is how can you sell those oil without those pipelines? Of course you need to build it. After a while, you were able to construct lines to your consumers and money started to come in. So the concept here is this, your pipelines are the businesses and money generating machineries you owned. While it prosper progressively, your surplus will buy whatever you need and aiming for. I hope this helps you a little. ",

            "answer_text": "You need a driving force and a plan. Why do you wanna be rich..? If you are doing a job and getting your monthly salary and you live for the weekends , life is chill and you just wanna be rich because you wanna buy more stuff ..? Do you think you can wake up at 4 o clock in the morning and start working just because you wanna buy stuff you dont even need. I dont think so It was 1997 , My family used to be poor my father was a Assistant Railway station manager and he used to get 3500 Rs as his salary after all the deductions. My mother was a housewife and she had to manage everything in those 3500 rs. Many times I did not even have shoes and I have many childhood photos where I\u2019m standing barefeet . We used to live in a railway quarter which was literally surrounded by forest and snakes and sorpions wer a common sight. All sorts of crazy people used to get off the train. Once 3 people barged in and held my father at gunpoint stole whatever little money we had and when we called police they asked us to sleep and deal with things in the morning. My mom was so worried about our safety but there was nothing she could do with the little money she had. Our town had only 1 good school in 2002 and because of some disputes people wer going to shut it down. My parents did not have enough money to send me to a better school in the city. So my mom made a plan. She decided to pool all her money she could get from family and whatever she saved and open a school. She had both ..The driving force (Her children\u2019s wellbieng amd safety) and a plan. She got support from my father and as usual there wer many people and relatives who wer laughing at her. Little did they know that she was going to give it her all. For 2 years she ran the school with no profit and some loss.. then for another 2 years with no profit no loss in a rented building. At this point most of the people would have lost patience but she kept going she made goals after goals but her ultimate goal was to get her own school building. She fought with rude parents she used to stay in school till 6 o clock in the evening then she would come home and maintain the registers . She never cared if it was raining or if it was crazy hot or chilly winter. Even when she fell off from a motorcycle and was badly injured she still showed up in school and managed things. She took care of our school like it was her own baby. At this point she had made many contacts in banks and post office which helped her open bank accounts and manage bank stuff. In 2008 she bought a piece of land and started the construction of the school. Since last 4 years Students from our school have been securing positions in district and state level merit list. And as they say..Luck favours the brave. Our Little town has just been declared a district last year. And our school is the best school there. I am lucky that my parents saved me from so much struggle and I\u2019m not saying that we have become filthy rich but considering how our financial conditions used to be.. my parents definitely provided me the resources to take it further and Now Its upto me. So up until now I was telling you about the hard work you need to do to develop a business. Once you successfully develop a business then you can buy assets through that business. Like Real estate , or an already running successful business like a food joint or a restaurant. Or you can invest in another one of your business but make sure you dont get too carried away. Like if you have a base business try to start another business related to the business you already own. That way you can use the contacts you have already made. Like after running a successfull school business one would be a fool to invest money in running a Flour Mill. Best option would be to either start a College or a playchool. Getting rich is a long process but if one is really willing to do whatever it takes then they can become rich no matter the circumstances. I\u2019d suggest you to read Robert Kiyosaki\u2019s book \u201cRich dad Poor dad\u201d and \u201cRich dad\u2019s guide to investing\u201d for a better understanding of assets and liabilities and where and how to invest.

This means investing in yourself to be excellent at something. 2: Get great at what you do Commit to being great, not just average. Any industry can be a painful profession for average and low performing actors, but enormously rewarding for those who are great. Those who live, breathe and eat their profession, those who are obsessed, become great. I have never met a great player who was not totally consumed by his trade. You have? The fact is that if you're not great, you're average. The rich become great. 3: Create a budget. Remember the steps in point 2: earn more money, spend less and invest wisely. Point 3 included earning more money, and this covers spending less. Make a detailed budget for you based on your projected income and your current expenses. Set firm limits for your expenses and closely monitor where most of your money goes; You might be surprised at some of the areas where you waste more money. Once identified, you can start refining your budget to spend as little as possible and channel the rest to a savings or investment program. 4: Take risks. You're young. You have many years ahead. Now is the time to take risks. Invest in opportunities for higher risk and higher return actions. Consider leaving your job to start your own business. Jump on new businesses and new opportunities. If things go wrong, you will have plenty of time to make up for it. Most wealthy people will tell you that one of their biggest keys to success has been taking calculated risks. The majority of the population follows the safe route, so if you want to separate from the pack, you should try something new, possibly something uncomfortable. 5: Get multiple, connected income streams flowing You will not get rich without multiple income streams. That starts with the income you currently have. Increase that revenue and start adding multiple streams. You want what is called symbiotic flows. Don't just add disconnected flows. Instead, find other ways to add income to the work you already have. My boy video advertises for me, and after proving himself, he started making announcements for those connected to me. A donut shop did not start. ",

            "answer_text": "You can copy what the 1% do. It\u2019s the best way to become rich. Generally, it\u2019s pretty hard to claim \u2018the best\u2019 of anything. The best hotdog? The best hotel? The best car? It\u2019s all a bit subjective, right? However, for wealth building there is a simple, non-negotiable, strategy that is the best. You have to have more wealth coming in than going out. It\u2019s just simple math. You have to be adding more than you are subtracting. In general, this means making more money than you are spending. This comes down to talent and discipline. Talent will increase the money that you make, while the discipline will limit that amount of money you spend. But, there is one more variable that we are all subject to, that plays a significant role in wealth building: Taxes. The lower your tax burden, the more money you get to keep. For the 1% (this year in the US, that\u2019s anyone making over $480,930), tax efficiency is almost as important as actual wealth creation.  Source: Bloomberg In addition to making sure that the money they are making is taxed as low as possible, the wealthy also pursue investments that are tax efficient to begin with. For example, in the US, municipal bonds are tax free. Municipal bonds are basically loans to cities. The interest that investors collect from these bonds are tax free. That\u2019s a major incentive. But, only certain investors are actually taking advantage of this: \"In 2015, Americans received $57 billion of tax-fee interest, according to the IRS. Just about half of that interest went to 1.2 million filers who earned $250,000 and more, which is how the IRS slices it.\u201d Look above at that chart again. If half of the the tax-free interest is going to people who make $250,000 or more, then that means that 2% of the population is receiving half of that incentive. Clearly, that is a lop-sided return\u2026 the rich get richer\u2026 right? It\u2019s true. The rich do get richer. Of course there are always bad actors in any industry, but there is a reason why wealthy people (and companies) continue to get wealthier. They continue to ensure that they are keeping as much wealth as possible. Just look at Ireland. The Los Angeles Times has said, \u201cIreland has become a mecca for US tech companies.\u201d That\u2019s because Ireland has a significantly lower corporate tax rate than the US. For the individual, there are all kinds of tax savings that you can take advantage of by simply looking at your tax law. It\u2019s usually a very good idea to pay someone to do your taxes. And don\u2019t be afraid to pay top dollar, as you usually get what you pay for\u2026 and that extra money you pay can often be well worth it in the long run. However, just like major corporations, it\u2019s usually the best to be physically located in a location that has the best tax laws. If you are a non-US citizen, the world is your oyster. You can basically pick from dozens of countries that have favorable tax laws. That\u2019s because non-US citizens do not have to pay their home country income taxes if they are living and sourcing their income from outside of their country. If you are a US citizen, then your options are very limited. US citizens are the only people in the world (except for those in the African nation of Eritrea) that have to pay taxes to their home country regardless of where they live or where they source their income. There are two main options for US citizens, if they choose to live and work outside of the US. First, they can take advantage of the FEIE, which is the Foreign Earned Income Exemption. Straight from the IRS website: \"If you are a U.S. citizen or a resident alien of the United States and you live abroad, you are taxed on your worldwide income. However, you may qualify to exclude from income up to an amount of your foreign earnings that is adjusted annually for inflation. In addition, you can exclude or deduct certain foreign housing amounts.\u201d For 2017, that amount is just over $100,000. So, if you make less than $100,000, you will not pay any US taxes. Second, if you make significantly more money than $100,000, and/or you don\u2019t want to move very far, there is another very good option. And this other option may be one of the greatest locations in the world right now for tax efficiency. You can pay ZERO taxes if you move to Puerto Rico. It\u2019s completely legal and you file your taxes annually with the IRS, just like you normally would\u2026 except you keep all of your money at the end of the year. There are, of course, a few catches. Here they are: You must live in Puerto Rico for more than half of the year.You pay 0% taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains.Also, if you set your company up in Puerto Rico, you only pay 4% taxes on your yearly net profit. Now, that\u2019s Puerto Rico just form a tax perspective. Let\u2019s say that you are not a US citizen (and don\u2019t care about this tax stuff)\u2026 there are incredible investment opportunities there right now. - We\u2019re going there in April, if you want to join us.

            "answer_text": "How to be wealthy? By owning assests that bring the money and reducing the ones which takes away the money. So, should you start earning 1 rupee every year? That doens\u2019t sound exotic, you want to be billionare or something. For that you need to learn investing, why investing why not startup, because investing has greater probability of you succeding if you learn about it, and you won\u2019t have to go through all the trouble of setting up systems. Ask yourself will you be able to create a brand that comepete aginst big companies like, google, facebook, P&g, mac d, pespsi and such? They have been there for decades, but I will say you can, but it will take so much time and effort and on the other hand you can just buy their share at the right price and you have just saved all the trouble that they haved while estabilishing their brand. This is how you become wealthy, Now there is a lot that I felt like using leverage in business to boost your returns. How to be rich? Now richness is a quality of life, you should be rich in your experiences. Mostly poeple want to be rich so that they can experience luxary, so if that is your goal than, the best way will be to pool the money and share it. Suppose you want a super sports bike, find other people who also want to own it, and pool the money to buy it and you all can share it. This way you all get to expereince it and your money invested per person will be very less. Not everything can be shared so be careful in choosing people with whom you like to share such things with. This way you can own almost anything, from private jet to super sports cars to big houses without investing so much of your money. Plus it\u2019s no fun to go for a long drive alone. In the end Earn enough that you feel satisfied, not enough that you don\u2019t have anyone to share it with. By: Chitanajn Baghi ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cMoney is plentiful for those who understand and apply simple rules to acquire it!\u201d  I read this book a while ago and i couldn't believe that acquiring money and getting rich is not that difficult. You got to follow some simple rules which are mentioned in this book. You just require self-discipline and mindfulness while dealing with money. Careful use and right methods of savings and investing may lead you to become wealthy. The simple 7 rule of acquiring and retaining money mentioned in this book are- Start thy purse to fattening- You need to save your earnings. Pay yourself atleast 10% of your earnings before paying it to anyone else. Create a savings over a long period of time maybe a year and be consistent and don't stop. You need money to create more money, understand that.Control thy expenditures- Start tracking your expenses. Cut off unnecessary expenses. Stop spending so much on a lifestyle that you've created just flaunt around. Be humble and control every coin and every cent you spend on things which aren't neccessary. Sometimes you think that a particular expense is neccessary for you to make but think twice before you increase your expenditure. Every coin you spend without being cautious is causing you so much money if try to evaluate and count compound interest on it.Make thy Gold multiply- Now you've done saving, you've done controlling your expenditures and it's time to multiply your money. Retain back that money into your business or professiona or services and fund yourself to expand. This will multiply your wealth slowly and you won\u2019t accumulate debt.Guard the treasures from loss- Many a times we fall for schemes and funnels which promises a high revenue but ends up making a loss to our principal amount. You need to guard your money by this type of losses cause you struggled to earn it and retain it. Don't invest, save or lent money where you have a 1% doubt that you may not earn a return but also you could loose your principal amount. Be aware about your money and safeguard it.Make thy dwelling a profitable investment- Invest your money into a profitable venture. Let your money generate more money by investing it after doing a thorough research and inspection. Trust your money with only those who have expertise in their field and haven't failed anyone in the past. This way your money will be safe and it will turn into a profitable investment.Insure a future income- Create some sources of passive income which could generate on their own and ensure that you get a steady income in the future. Try to create a stream of income which not only covers the expenditures of yours but also creates a surplus so you could make more money out of it.Increase thy ability to earn- This goes without saying that at last it's you who's gonna start earning, saving and investing, multiplying your money to become wealthy so you have to increase your ability to earn more. You just can't sit there thinking about bank accounts showing big fat balances by just earning in 4 to 5 figure income.

            "answer_text": " There are many ways people become rich. Also, rich means different as per the individual. Some people view rich as having a positive net worth while some people think being rich is being a billionaire. However, to directly answer this question, one becomes rich by simply making, saving, and then investing that money properly that they make and save. Most people become rich over time. Think about the picture I included. If you invested your money and generated an annual return of 20% which is difficult but possible, you can turn $50k into over $70m in 40 years. That is also adding nothing with that initial $50k as well.  So if I were to give you advice, the first thing you want to do is learn to build income. Learn to build income by creating different income streams. The more sources of income you have, the better. I still count investing as income as well. So everyone that works one job can have at least two sources of income. Once you build income, save your money. It is better making $50k and saving $20k per year than making $100k and saving $10k per year. And once you save, invest that money right away. Inflation silently keeps the middle class from becoming wealthy if they do not invest. When you invest, learn to do it properly. Don\u2019t take on risk as much when you are older. If you are young, feel free to take on risk. Be diverse as well no matter what age. With investing, it is usually the most patient that wins, and not the most eager to make money. Don\u2019t expect to get rich overnight.  Now, there are ways to get rich quick, like somehow building a miracle app and getting millions of downloads and suddenly becoming a multimillionaire maybe a year later. It is possible, but much harder than just investing like the example above. Ask most wealthy people, and they made their money thanks to compounding interest and earning a decent income or better most of their life. Few people built billion-dollar companies. But, I am not discouraging you. You should actually try anything. So yes, people get rich through many different ways. Some even do it illegally which I advise not to do obviously. Making money illegal is wrong. Many people can build wealth in real estate as well. Some people hit the lottery. Some are NBA players. It all varies, but again, investing over time is very common compared to other ways to get rich. So there you have it.

            "answer_text": "If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die. Warren Buffett. I have read one story on internet and that is the perfect answer for your question. Okey lets start A poor good soul man complained to God, saying, \u201chow unfair life is, the rich man has it so easy but I have to work like a salve!\u201d So God took the rich man and made him as poor as the poor man, and gave them both fishing rods. Now poor man is somewhat satisfied and left to home. So of course, both being poor, they start fishing. After the first day, the poor man catches 10 fish and sells them for $20 at the market. Happy, he decides to buy some veggies, some rice, and as a special treat, some meat too for his family and they have a grand night. The rich man also catches 10 fish, but he sells 9 for $18. He eats the last fish with his family, but it\u2019s not enough so they go to bed hungry. The next day he takes his $18, and offers a fellow $10 to help him fish. The next day he gets 20 fish ($40) and repeats the process. The poor man still buys some veggies, some meat, and remains the same. After some time, the rich man has saved enough money to make other investments and other business ventures. So what we have learned from this, By willing to make sacrifice and willing to take risk for the investment is the only way to become rich. You can't get rich by saving the money and you will end up in the rat race. Just start today with the affordable amount which you can lose and start learning investing. Read many books like rich dad poor dad or intelligent investor. Or else here is the another way there are many branches like PNB bank is still here to give 11,300crore.

            "answer_text": "I'll give a more fundamental answer than a lot of people on here.  You want to be rich. That means \"having a lot of money\". If you want to have a lot of money you have to get it from somewhere. Where is the only place you can get it? From people who already have it. So how do you get them to give it to you?  Barring crime the most consistent way is to offer them something in return, it's an exchange. So you need to start by having something to offer to them, which you'll convince them to give you money in exchange for. Convincing people they want something is hard so the easiest way is to offer them something they already want.  In other words offer people something they are already buying that way you just have to convince them to buy it from you rather than someone else, which you can do by being cheaper, more convenient, offering better service, a better guarantee, etc. A lot of people talk about \"add value\" but don't really define what that means. What it means is offer something a little better for what they are getting than someone else, that differential is the value you're offering. In the aggregate of you're offering more value you'll get more business provided you can market as well.  Now, you can get someone to give you billions and still be broke if it costs you as much to sell it to the person as they pay you for it so what you've got to do is learn to keep costs low, buy things for way less than they are worth/sell for. I'd aim to find something that sells for 4-5 times what it costs you if possible as a place to start, information products are a good place to start.  You can buy something cheap and sell it for fair market value though and not get rich though. To be rich you don't just need to make money, you need to make a lot of money and you do that by being able to sell a lot of something. To do this you need two things: 1. Lots of buyers (or big buyers) - in other words find a good sized market  2. Enough quantity at a good deal to service a big enough part of the market - hint, get away from selling your time, you can only sell so much of it. You could sell the time of someone else buy there are more moving parts in there so usually selling products or digital goods/services/information is the easiest to scale though there are lots of other options this is usually the easiest place to start  In order to do this consistently it usually helps to be an expert in what you're selling and the market for what you're selling so dedicate yourself to that mastery.  Apply this process consistently and grind it out and you'll get there.  To recap: - find something with a decent sized market that you can buy for substantially less than the market price  - give a competitive offer to the people who are already buying this stuff  - keep your spending low so you accumulate as much of the difference as possible  - grow it as big as you can Hope that helps.

            "answer_text": "There are many paths to wealth, spiritual and physical wealth. I've gotten much satisfaction in both through being in real estate brokerage and investment. The key is knowing who you are, your strengths and weaknesses. What you are not expert at you can hire someone who is or partner with someone who has those strengths you lack. Choose your path based on your interests and your reason(s) you like being on the planet. This makes you realize that you want wealth for a bigger purpose: your family, church, community, cause...something more than just your personal consumption. People come before anything. Put your priorities in order. People, Product and Profit in that order. I try to live with the Golden Rule, treat others as you would want to be treated.  Then, you need Goal(s), a Plan to attain those Goal(s), Strategies to implement the Plan, and Tactics to implement your strategies. I think \"luck\" is being industrious while working on your Plan to attain your Goal(s) that is opportunity. If you want to make money of course you need to build your goals around something the world will pay you for...sometimes that is apparent, sometimes not. Taking risk by building something new and untried has the highest risk for failure and the highest reward potential. You get to choose. You can gain wealth through old line industry like real estate, or try something as wild as AOL was in the early days of its existence when Steve Case was involved. Play to your heart and stick to the Plan and you should do well, providing you live within your means and don't squander your assets.  ",

You have two options to become rich.. Simple and easy.. which most people wish and try to do..Read this story\u2026 Lisa bought a donkey from a farmer for \u00a3100.  The farmer agreed to deliver the donkey the next day. In the morning he drove up and said ... 'Sorry , but I have some bad news. The donkey died.' Lisa replied, 'Well just give me my money back then.' The farmer said, 'Can't do that. I've already spent it.' Lisa said, ' OK then, just bring me the dead donkey.' The farmer asked, 'What are you going to do with him?' Lisa said, 'I'm going to give him off in a lottery prize.' The farmer said, 'You can't do that with a dead donkey!' Lisa said, 'Sure I can. Watch me. I just won't tell anybody he's dead.' A month later, the farmer met up with Lisa and asked, 'What happened with that dead donkey?' Lisa said, 'I gave him off in a lottery. I sold 500 tickets at \u00a32 each and made a profit of \u00a3898.' The farmer said, 'Didn't anyone complain?' Lisa said, 'Just the guy who won. So I gave him his \u00a32 back.' Well, jokes apart.., In one way or the other, most of the people/ business houses apply the above strategy to become rich.. 2. The right way, but not the easier..! First and foremost., You should believe in yourself that you want to and is able to grow richer\u2026 A strong belief triggers the required energy that works wonders.. Then., Identify what you are best in.. Search and look for your own skills, abilities, shortcomings.. You are \u2018best\u2019 in something or the other for sure.. Start your work, job, business NOW.., no matter how small and insignificant it may look like.. Waiting for the \u2018right opportunity\u2019 is not going to take you anywhere.. Work for 15 hours every day.., each day.., and at least for a few years.. There is no relaxation in this.. Be willing to take \u2018risks\u2019.. Because, only such people who don\u2019t hesitate to take risks are able to encounter richness.. Each day think about how you can further improvise your work, service, product.. This is the secret to your being successful.. Make sure you love and respect your work.. Do not worry about what profit you are earning, instead, focus entirely on making your service, product acceptable and likable by everyone connected.. If you are passionate about your work and if your priorities are not just making profit, but to make your service, product acceptable to all.., you will surely nail it.. Bottom Line: You can not do something to become rich.. but what and how you do things can always make you rich..! (Image Courtesy: Google Images) ",

            "answer_text": "Browsing around the magic world of Twitter this morning I run into something that got my attention: It was an article published by a Spanish newspaper about average and median income in Spain. So, apparently, the average yearly salary for a Spanish worker is around 16,000 euro. Only 17% of our population makes over 30k a year. And our top 1%, the highest income guy or gal of every 100, makes 95k a year. I used to live in Charlotte, North Carolina about a year ago. What do you think the numbers would be there? Well, the average salary in the United States is around 45k dollars (almost 30k more than in Spain). And the 1%? They make just shy of half a million dollars. But how about New York City, for example? The average salary is about 70k (not bad, huh), and the 1% makes OVER 600,000k. That\u2019s a lot of money.  Just a couple weeks back I received a message on Quora from a guy in Nigeria. He was an amazing writer (probably better than myself), and he was telling me that the average YEARLY salary in his country was less than 4 thousand US dollars. Isn\u2019t that crazy? Let\u2019s keep digging? How about India, where the yearly salary is less than two thousand dollars? Or Kenya? Fifteen hundred dollars.   But what\u2019s my point and why am I not telling you how to be rich? The truth is that if you are born in Europe, America, Australia/NZ, most parts of Asia, and many other regions in the world\u2026 you probably are rich already. Yes, you might not have that flaming lambo that you so want, but you have running water every time you go to the shower, right? And you eat three times a day? And you can buy books whenever you want? And you have a laptop? Yes, you are rich. And this is not a touchy-feely advice that tells you you have to be a hippy. Absolutely not. Go get yours if you want. But you just have to understand that the world does not end at the border of your state, your country, or even your continent. Be thankful for where you are, for what you have, and the opportunities you enjoy.  You should totally follow me here on Quora for more stuff like this.

            "answer_text": "I once asked my uncle, who retired at age 50, this question. He said, \u201cPranav, there are 4 ways to get rich.\u201d I\u2019m going to share them with you. ONE: You are born rich You have heard how some people are born with a silver spoon. Certainly, being born rich is the easiest way to become rich. TWO: Marry someone rich I have observed relatives and friends become rich overnight simply by marrying someone rich. This is not necessarily easy since people are always going to bad mouth you. You need a thick skin, and the ability to look beyond your partner\u2019s wealth. Rich people, like anyone else, have dysfunctional families too. The wealth compounds the dysfunctionality, and money has been known to tear families apart. THREE: Get very lucky My uncle considered himself lucky and this is how he made his wealth. He bought a property at the right time and place. He told me that when he bought his first property - a house - he and his wife could not afford any furniture and they slept on the floor until they could afford a mattress. He expressed gratitude for being able to sell and buy a larger property several times, catching the property cycles at the right times. FOUR: Work very, very, very hard Yes, hard work can make you rich, but you have to work very, very, very hard. My uncle also said, \u201cPranav, your parents are not rich, so that's out for you. If you want to be rich, you must work very, very, very hard and get lucky or find yourself a rich girl.\u201d I'm still working hard. ",

            "answer_text": "The Guaranteed Way to Get Rich I\u2019m impressed by the diversity of answers to this question. The problem, however, is that for someone trying to find a guaranteed path to wealth, these diverse inputs only end up causing confusion. One advices you to start a dropshipping business while another tells you to invest in real estate. From Youtube to Amazon FBA there are literally a million ways to make a million dollars, each with its own trajectory, lifestyle, initial investments, workload, failure rates and so on. As an avid reader of business books, stories on how millionaires made their money, business models, income streams etc., I have compared all possible pathways to wealth to find which is the easiest, fastest and the most guaranteed way to become rich, which can be adopted by anyone irrespective of their age, financial situation or educational qualifications. So, without further ado, let me introduce you to the quickest (considering legal ones only), safest and comparitevely the easiest method to richness . It is called \u201cThe Wealth Triangle\u201d and it was proposed by Canadian multi-millionaire entrepreneur Dan Lok.  It is the most efficient and effective roadmap to wealth and contains 3 steps: STEP 1: MONETIZING A HIGH-INCOME SKILL (you trade hours for dollars) Lok defines it as any skill which is fairly easy to learn, is in high demand and that which earns you over $10,000 a month. Note that it is a \u201cskill\u201d ,not a \u201chigh-income job\u201d and does not require a degree. I\u2019m sure you know that not every job is created equal. Your level of education or experience is irrelevent as the actual determinant of your salary in the eyes of the economy is simply supply and demand. Your Ph.D is worthless and your $100k/ yr job will vanish overnight if a machine/AI can replace you. However, there are some skills that are irreplacable and will always stay in high demand which results in a higher income. Like every other job, you trade your time in exchange for dollars but here, it is \u201chigh dollars\u201d. Examples of high-income skills include copywriting, closing, social media marketing, SEO, UI/UX design, web design, youtube and so on. Heck, even if you have some weird niched talent and can make 10 grand a month with it, that could also be considered in this category. You will be self employed and can work on your own terms from any location around the world. I am a copywriter myself and if you don\u2019t know what that means, let me tell you. When you visit a website that sells any form of products of services, the textual content is written by copywriters like me. Other high-income skills are given below:  You can learn these skills from courses or even youtube videos and blogs. This is the stage where you start earning a lot of money. During this stage, you should save most of your income. After some time, you slowly realise that despite working very profitable projects, you still have to exchange your time for money and that you cannot add more hours to the 24-hour clock to increase your earnings. Your earning are great but it can only be grown linearly. To grow your wealth exponentially, you need to slowly proceed to STEP 2. STEP 2: START A SCALABLE BUSINESS (you leverage business systems to work for you) A scalable business is one that does not require much infastructure and has the potential for becoming really large. If you start a restaurant business, you are tied down to its location and hence not scalable. Most scalable businesses are internet businesses but the list also includes software services, e-commerce etc. Another clever business idea is to sell digital products like courses teaching people about the high-income skill you posses from Step 1. All you have to do is record the material once and the rest needs no extra expenditure whether you sell thousands or millions of it. Scalable businesses have the potential to be sold for a very large sum of money. Although, you still have to spend a lot of time in your business, your income numbers are growing exponentially. To free up time inorder to enjoy your wealth, you have to build automated systems in your business so that it runs smoothly even without your involvement. I suggest you to read the book The Four-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferris to know more on how to manage a multi-million dollar business without even being present in it while you travel the world. STEP 3: INVEST IN HIGH RETURN INVESTMENTS (your money makes you more money) This is the final step of the process where you gain complete freedom. At this stage, you can either sell your company for a very large sum of money or keep it if it does not require your presence at all and has a high amount of cashflow. This large sum should be invested in a diverse portfolio of high return investments that ensure a steady cashflow and grows in capital. It is at this stage that your net worth increases. You also enjoy freedom as you don\u2019t have to work anymore and you can use this oppurtunity to travel the world or do what you love. Well, why should I follow this path? I could simply raise a lot of money in loans and start a business directly without step 1. Here\u2019s why: 9 out of every 10 businesses fail in the first year itself. No matter how great you think your product or service is, there is no guarantee when it comes to business. But the great thing here is that even if your business fails, you still have a high income skill to fall back on. You won\u2019t be affected in a major way and your lifestyle expenses will be met as usual. Your previous experience and contacts can still be used to resume your high-income career. You won\u2019t have to pay back anything to anybody since your business was not started through debt. You can see a lot of people who fall into the trap of mortgaging their homes to start a business and ultimately fail, losing everything in the process. On the contrary, when you are\u2019nt worried about failure, you are not under a lot of stress or pressure. This improves your productivity as well as mental well-being.High-income skills open doors to the inner workings of different industries and teach you valuable skills that are required for running a business. This could be negotiation skills, communication skills, competitior research and so on. Another thing is that the contacts you\u2019ve gained can be leveraged when starting your business.It exposes you to the various pain points in different industries and can spark great business ideas within you.You can manage to operate your business at a loss to grow quicker and beat out the competition due to your high-income earnings.Due to all these reasons, I think that the Wealth Triangle is the most guaranteed yet quickest way to wealth. Thank you for reading. I am Joel and I\u2019ll see you in another answer. P.S I\u2019m new to Quora. Your upvotes and followings are highly appreciated Thank u ",

            "answer_text": "Two forces that a lot of people underestimate by a wide margin:1) The power of compounding2) The power of leverage (both operational and financial leverage) The power of compoundingIf you invest your money at a 10% annual return, you basically double your money every 7 years. That means if you start with 100K$ that you saved during your first career years, you would end up with 200K$ 7 years after; 400K$ 14 years after; 800K$ 21 years after and so on... Obviously, most people have no idea that compounding is so powerful, otherwise, there would be a much bigger amount of compounders... The power of leverageAll rich people understand that they need to incorporate some form of leverage to compound at a faster rate. Take for example Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway, his insurance subsidiaries collect premiums before rendering any insurance services, leaving him a massive float of money that he can invest for his shareholders before he has to pay any coverage. Some people invest in equipments that are going to deliver sustainable revenues in exchange for an upfront fixed cost. Take for example an automatic printer that would print business cards super fast. Well, that machine might cost 250K$ upfront but once you've got it up running, you can deliver more business cards while the machine has become a fixed cost, thus, leaving you with margin expansion if you can grow revenues. Revenues goes up while expenses stay partly fixed. That is the power of operational leverage. Other people use financial leverage to get rich. Real Estate investors are known for doing it. They take 4$ of debt for every dollar of equity and buy a commercial or residential property that is going to leave them with a stable, predictable and slightly growing cashflow. In fact, most people say that their house was their best investment ever... What they do not know is that the house hasn't made them so much money but the financial leverage they took on when making their buy decision made them a lot. Houses do not go up in price by much (probably around 5% per year) and when you add up all taxes paid annually, it's really not the big thing! But, when you take on leverage, it's much different. Take for example a 250K$ house that you buy with only 25K$ equity at start. If the house value goes up by 5% the first year, it's 12,5K$ up pre-interests on an equity investment of 25K$, that's a 50% return. Leverage and compounding aren't really secret it's just that most people don't bother it and do not ask themselves how they could make more money while rich people do. ",

            "answer_text": "Save - unsexy, but it has to be done. Minimum 40% of income.Cashflow - this could be a job, or business.Invest - whatever is left after you\u2019ve put your 40% under the bed, you invest in things that are LOW risk, HIGH return. The lower the risk, the higher the return, the better - of course. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you that such investments don\u2019t exist. \u2018Risk\u2019 isn\u2019t absolute - its personal and subjective.Re-invest - profit should be reinvested back into income-generating infrastructure - such as a business, or other investments. If you have a job, want to create a personal brand, or are self-employed, this profit could be re-invested into learning new skills, or marketing yourself to high-paying companies.Seek out good information - mainstream media is highly processed information that is uninvestable. To catch trends early, you have to be prepared to look beyond the herd mentality.Cultivate self-discipline - there is a direct relationship between impulse control and wealth. More impulse control = higher earning potential. Audit your diet, exercise, sexual activities, and work out where and - more importantly - why your self-control breaks down.Practice being wealthy - many are unprepared for wealth when it happens to them. Then they give it all away, because they don\u2019t feel it should belong to them. Visit car showrooms and houses that you would purchase if you were ultra-wealthy. Change your habits, language and thoughts to align with the person the person you want to be.Surround yourself with other wealthy people. You become the company you keep.Eat cat food - STAY AWAY from all forms of debt: mortgages, credit cards etc. They are for plebs and ultimately they play upon the public\u2019s low impulse control. Self-discipline is the ability to live as though you\u2019re broke, so that your financial inventory isn\u2019t wasted on temporary pleasure and status symbols. Be prepared to live like you\u2019re broke for decades. Cold showers, same clothes, single beds, public transport.Why? - why do you want ultra-wealth? Is it for \u2018freedom\u2019? Is it to ultimately help others? Is it to buy out and destroy whaling ships in order to save the dolphin and whale populations? Is it to develop technology that could quickly remove plastic from the oceans? Is it \u2018just because\u2019? Asking yourself why will give the path meaning and motivation.",

            "answer_text": "I wrote a below piece more than 3 years ago. I got some interesting results following those steps. (See at the end)  To become wealthy you need your own business. It\u2019s an axiom. Wages are my hobby. In my country only 2% of the population earns more than $3k per month. And they are almost exclusively managers and business owners. There are very, very few specialists among those 2% and most of them earn just a little above $3k. The higher you go on the wages ladder, the fewer managers you can find and the more entrepreneurs there are. And at some high enough point there are no specialists. In the USA the level of \u201cno specialists\u201d point is higher, but the rule is the same \u2013 if you want to get big bucks you need to own a business. I have no idea how to launch a successful business. I\u2019m a lifelong employee. My grandparents were farmers. My mom is a housewife and my dad is a lifelong employee, too. He started his own business twice and failed twice. The most successful entrepreneur I know is my uncle. His company survived for about 20 years. He has a dozen employees, a flat, a house, a few cars and was forced to get $30k credit to maintain financial liquidity last year. So I don\u2019t know what it takes to succeed in business.What is more, my mindset is an employee\u2019s mindset. I don\u2019t BELIEVE I can earn more than 4$k a month in the same way I don\u2019t believe I can fly to the moon. It\u2019s NOT possible! However.There were people who started where I did and achieved an enormous success. Jim Rohn at the age of 25 was employed and broken. At the age of 31 he was a millionaire.Bob Proctor was a broken employee at the age of 24. He set himself a goal to earn a $4k next year and he earned $170k. And there are more of such cases. It\u2019s possible to get rich. If they could do it, then there is some way I can do it too. A way you can do it.The formulas for getting rich are different for each person, there is no sure way to success or most of us would already be wealthy and happy.But there are some common traits.  1. First of them is Faith.Some says you have to believe in yourself, but that\u2019s not true. At least it isn\u2019t true in every case. Jim Rohn had little to none self doubts. But Bob Proctor says he didn\u2019t believe he could earn those $4k, he only believed that his mentor certainly believed that it\u2019s possible. So Proctor believed in his mentor\u2019s faith. Wallace D. Wattles, a New Age author, recommended believing that the universe is build from the basic thinking substance, which is friendly to any progress and which you can influence by a power of thought. If you think that\u2019s preposterous \u2013 think again. At least a few modern millionaires credit part of their success to his book \u2013 The Science of Getting Rich. Blessed Jan Beyzym didn\u2019t believe in himself at all. He knew he was nothing more than one of the worst sinners on Earth. But he believed he is a tool in God\u2019s hand. He was able to achieve worldly success basing on this faith. So Faith is one of elements of success. 2. Vision is another one.If you have heard about a man or woman who claims that dreams, goals and visualization was not necessary to reach their successes, please refer me to them. It will be the first such testimonial I encountered. Jim Rohn was one of the most down to earth persons in the world. He mocked the idea of personal affirmation more than once. But when it went to goals he had always been advising to see and feel the results in your mind when setting them. Wallace D. Wattles set personal vision as the first and central element of getting rich process. Jan Beyzym wrote in his letters, that closing the eyes he can see the hospital for the lepers he wanted to build, clearly in his mind. 3. Work is the last component.It hasn\u2019t to be hard work. It hasn\u2019t to be a grand one. It has to be incessant. Jim Rohn said he became a millionaire in 6 years, because he consistently did easy things. His definition of easy: something you can do. Wallace D. Wattles went even further with his mystical inclinations \u2013 he advised just to work with your vision in mind. No matter what you do, you will reach its realization one day, if you work every day having your dream in mind. Once again \u2013 don\u2019t ridicule him, some millionaires claim it works. Jan Beyzym did something similar in fact. He tirelessly worked on making the life of his lepers more bearable, he fed them, he medicated them, he tended their wounds, he prayed for them and with them. And between those mundane tasks he had been writing hundreds of letters to donors. He appealed to the government for resources and did a bunch of other things to make his dream come true. Faith, Vision and Work.The ratios of each may be different for you, but all of them are essential. So I urge you to formulate your dream, to find a faith in something inflexible, whatever is inflexible for you \u2013 God, yourself, your spouse, your friends, your mentor \u2013 and to lay down a way to work on your dream every single day. In my modest opinion this is the way to get the results.  Originally posted on ExpandBeyondYourself.com in October 2013  Post Scriptum 3 years later I started my own venture. I\u2019m authorpreneur. I have several streams of income, but the main bulk are books royalties. Since writing the above post my income grew 86%. In December 2016 I earned $4,000 for first time ever. In fact, I earned more than that, but over $4k came from my books only. It appears I can fly to the moon ;) ",

            "answer_text": "Habits that can make you rich Everyone wants to be rich in life. Does everyone become rich? The truth is that everyone wants to be rich but really fail to plan and think outside the box. There is no get rich quick system, it is a process that takes time, patience and continuous effort to build wealth. If you want to build wealth, you have to start with your habits. The rich and successful people regularly follow certain habits. Small habits can get you pretty far in acquiring wealth. If you learn to adopt these habits early in life, you can also have a shot at achieving wealth and success in life. Here are 7 habits that can make you rich 1. Set Some Goals Setting goals gives you a sense of direction and boosts your motivation and self confidence. Wishing will not bring riches, so set some goals and track your your progress towards your goals at regular intervals  2. Build up Multiple Sources of Income Most of us rely on one source of income but rich people have more than one source of income. 3. Save and Invest Money Always spend less than you earn. Start learning the habit of saving money and concentrate on saving as much as you can. Make it a habit to save at least 50% of every pay raise. 4. Surround Yourself with Successful People The people we spend our time with have a great impact on our lives. We are only as successful as the people we associate with 5. Take Risks Everyone wants to be rich, but they do not want to take risks. Becoming rich is not easy. Becoming rich means you require to take risks, work long hours or make sacrifices. 6. Stay Focused and Positive When you set some goals, you feel confident and energized but this fades away after some tome when you fail to stay focused and positive on your goals. Successful people always stay focused and positive on their goals.   7. Read Everyday Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body - Joseph Addison. Rich and successful people are avid readers and the reason they read is to improve themselves. Adopt just one of above mentioned habits is all to take yourself out of your current circumstances. If you want to be rich in life you have to change your habits and the choices you have made. Just adopt the above mentioned habits as a template for achieving wealth and success in life. ",

            "answer_text": "Wow. Finally a question worth answering. There are several ways to answer this type of question. I know one of the best ways to become rich , the best way till date. Excited huh? Inherit. Please, have a setting with God that he borns you in not Bezos or Gates family, but atleast in some xyz rich family. I can't reveal the secret of how to persuade GOD sorry. I can do, you got to pay some money for it. If you are poor, and cannot get access to my guide of persuading GOD, don't worry, I have another way for you poor people. Befriend a rich family and butter them everyday and enjoy the luxuries. Oh shit, you can't even do this, okay, marry a rich girl, oh no wait, if you cannot befriend a rich family or make a rich friend, how can you even think of marrying a rich girl. Damn you, you are burden to the society. You deserve to be poor. Die. Second way and some people who still think this works. What does the old school teach you? Study hard, get good grades, get good college, get a job, enjoy life. Oh, I cannot even control my laughter while writing this. I just realize how the school and college scammed us for years. Let's not be sarcastic here and uncover the myth which many of us have that by doing a job, you can get rich. No, you cannot become rich by doing job for sure. Third and most popular way. Entrepreneurship. Start a company and blah blah blah and see how you beat Bezos. I hope by now you understood it was a sarcastic answer and don't bash me in comments. So coming to a non sarcastic part of answer. None of us can actually tell you how to become rich, everyone will be giving their different theories and I respect it. What worked for them, might not work for you. Someone became rich by investing on stock market, not necessary you will, some became rich by starting a company, not necessary you will, some became rich by acting, not necessary you will. See, we can give you theories and ways to become rich, but that doesn't matter, unless that particular area interests you and you can work you ass off on it no matter what, that will surely make you rich. You need to figure out what your potential is, unlock it, work on it, build it and boom. It's not certain that once you unlock your potential, you will become rich and win the game. No. The time is different, this is not our grandfather's or father's period where there was little or no competition, this is your period where the potential you have is shared by millions other, it purely depends upon the work and determination you put to achieve. The hunger you possess to achieve. That will make you rich. Go out and start meeting people, read, read, read, learn, learn, learn, practice, practice, practice, imply, imply, imply, fail, fail, fail, get up, repeat, you will find that small hole of success which is deep inside. One last thing, I'd like to quote myself here You can only become rich by doing a business, no one has ever become rich by doing a job. Job - Regular Job am talking about and not the positions of VP or COO which you will eventually get only after 15\u201320 years after good good good hardwork ",

            "answer_text": "A lot has been said and a lot has been shown by beautiful calculations. But let\u2019s hit the core of the question in simple words. What is to be RICH means? To be rich simply means to have in abundance (more than required to sustain a lifestyle) following two things- Money- A resource that helps you interact with man-made world. Time- A limited resource which everyone has in same measure but how much of that goes into generating the Money is what defines actual available time each day to you. A truly rich person has both in abundance at all times and not a perception that someday it might happen. Now how to be rich? To be rich is not a phenomenon that will happen someday. It has to start happening everyday. Someday you will just have a lot of money and no time and today as a young guy you have time but no money. So whats the use of money without time and thus you can\u2019t be rich. You have to be rich today Remember, more than just being rich its important that you feel Rich. Balance your Time and money each day. A lot of things in other answers can tell you how to increase money and yes that is a process that will happen. Just remember- In following the financial algorithm do not compromise the fun of today.All time you have in a day is not meant for financial activity. Time needs to be given for your body too. Your family and friends need that minute of yours too. And above all each day you need some time for yourself to just relax and do nothing. Look carefully you want a life like those rich people because this is what they do each day. They are meeting people, celebrating, travelling , partying and giving themselves a lot of time. It can be done today itself if you just give importance to time.Rest you will get it by reading few answers. ",

            "answer_text": " Sell T-Shirts. No, seriously. Meet Jason Sadler. Jason is a creative entrepreneur through-and-through. After a brief stint in the corporate cubicle, he decided to jump ship and work for himself. He became the happy co-owner of a successful web design firm in Florida and was making good money. But then he had his \u2018aha\u2019 moment. You know exactly what I\u2019m talking about. The idea you can\u2019t stop thinking about. The one you annoy your parents or your friends about. That was Jason. \u201cA new idea popped into my head. An idea that eventually would consume my thoughts day in and day out. An idea that was all I wanted to talk about and all I wanted to focus my energy on. I wanted to get paid to wear T-shirts.\u201d Timeout\u2026paid to wear t-shirts? What the hell is this guy talking about? Jason was very serious and wasn\u2019t going to stop until he sold out the space on his chest.  On January 1, 2009, Jason started The Story of IWearYourShirt and How I Made $1,000,000 Wearing T-Shirts (IWYS) and became a walking billboard for any company crazy enough to pay him. He \u201ccharged his first client, Streaming & Online Video Services | IBM Cloud Video, $1 to wear a branded T-shirt. On Jan. 2, he charged the next company $2. On the 114th day of 2008, he charged a company $114 to wear their T-shirt, and so on, until Dec. 31, when he pocketed $365. At that point, he had accumulated $70,000.\u201d Year 1 sold out in just six months, and brands poured in for space on Jason\u2019s chest. By 2012, IWYS had raised prices significantly and was bringing in $500,000 in annual revenue. Inventory was tight (literally), so Jason hired four other shirt wearers to rep businesses from Starbucks to Pizza Hut. By the time Jason wore his last sponsored tee, in May 2013, IWYS had generated over $1,000,000 in advertising revenue from more than 1,600 businesses across the country. His story was told by The Today Show, CBS Evening News, and Fortune Magazine, and he even published a book on IWYS\u2019 journey titled Creativity For Sale. Just think about that for a second. This man created a million-dollar business by wearing t-shirts and posting about the experience. No product. No business plan. Just a ridiculous idea and a whole lot of grit. As you might have guessed, IWYS was just the beginning of Jason\u2019s eccentric entrepreneurial journey. In 2012, Sadler auctioned the rights to\u2014wait for it\u2014his last name to the highest bidder. Headsets: Plantronics, Wireless, USB, Computer & Phone Office Headsets paid $45,000. So for a year, Jason Sadler became Jason HeadsetsDotCom. We wish I was kidding.  If you like mind-blowing business stories like Jason\u2019s, you\u2019ll love Morning Brew\u2019s daily email newsletter. Seriously, check it out. Source: Morning Brew ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely anyone can become rich - 100% guaranteedAnd it has absolutely NOTHING to do with education, hard work, making a lot of money already and all those myths. Becoming rich is all about a single factor: LEVERAGE However, lack of education how to become wealthy or the hunt to become rich fast - prevents over 7 Billion people to get there. Only the fact that you find very rich people in the poorest countries indicates, somehow it is possible ;) LACK OF EDUCATIONNOT GENERAL EDUCATION THOUGH. Unfortunately with the 10,000 hours on general education, no matter in which developed country or the few hundred hours in the least developed countries, people DO NOT get educated in how to acquire wealth. This stems from the thinking several hundred years ago that it is good to educate people on how to become better workers but not how to develop wealth themselves. And so it is today. Not a single 45 minute slot during roughly 15 years of education is used to explain how wealth is generated.LACK OF DEFINITIONDefine rich! Is it just the money? Again, unfortunately for more than 3 billion of the 7 billion, people it is just money because money translate to the ability to survive better and do things apparently other people on this planet can do. And as in top (1) here it is ok for most of the leaders to keep it that way - keep an army of poor workers. Take an artist like a musician, painter, or entrepreneur for that matter, they are far more happy with less and have a good chance to become richer than the worker bees. If rich is the ability to live on less and follow your dreams, then yes, everybody can be rich and also economically.ECONOMIC WEALTHListen: Every poor person with no education in the poorest country in the world can become rich. How? They need to learn nothing but the concept of leverage. If they can invest six penny per day from the $1,20 they get on average, they will become rich. But they need to be willing to live on $1,14. Which is equally hard than taking $60 from the $1,200 you are making a month in the US and having to feed a whole family. Or $30 if you are making $600 a month. It\u2019s 5% of whatever you make. You then increase the amount by 20% after a year. If you make $2,500 per month today, you get most likely to $5 Million by 2045. If you make $250 per month in an early emerging country you get to $500,000 which is a multi millionaire in an emerging country. You can now take country by country, look at the GDP and the GDP/C in the Internet (Wikipedia) and you make an astonishing discovery. The same formula works for every economy and you get rich even faster, the poorer the country is. One way or the other fill whole books with that concept but you may still hunt this one magical book that makes you rich instantly. Or worse: play lottery to hope the infinite wealth is coming next friday.Without getting to far into more astonishing details: Y E S - absolutely everybody can get rich. BUT the greed in most countries is already so high that you think every single day \u201cHOW CAN I GET RICH QUICKLY\u201d instead of \u201chow can I invest daily\u201d - and that keeps you poor. SMART PEOPLE TAKE A BIT OF THEIR MONEY AND INVESTLESS SMART TAKE A BIT OF THEIR MONEY AND JUST SPEND IT The more one spends, gives the smarter more to invest. And the gap is widening infinitely. And that is the ultimate difference. One of the richest man, Warren Buffet, is also one of the best examples to study. And one last stunning statistic: 75% of the wealthiest people stared a business with nothing. The other 25% got their wealth through marriage, inheritance and other ways. That\u2019s why we have more startups today then ever before - AND - we see the number of millionaires growing faster than ever before. ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s start by defining what you mean by being rich. Do you want to own your own company? How much per month do you want to earn? If you were rich, what would you do? How would you know if you were rich? Where would you like to live? What would you invest in? What kind of car would you drive? What kind of house would you live in? What is your current occupation? If you were rich, would you continue doing that? If not, what would you do? Why do you want to be rich? You see, the first step is defining your target wealth and why that is important to you. Just saying you want a bunch of money doesn\u2019t define what a bunch is to you. Disliking where you are at in life isn\u2019t sufficient motivation either. You will find that if you sacrifice your honesty or integrity anywhere along the line, the riches you accumulate won\u2019t buy those back for you. There is an old proverb, \u201cIf you help enough other people to get what they want, you can get anything you want.\u201d Who do you care about besides yourself? Who would you like to help? What do you see as your purpose in life? These are all critical questions. The fact is that if your only concern is for yourself, there are not many people who will help you get what you want. What is in it for them? Supposing I could teach you what to do, and how to think, to become rich, would you really listen? Are you coachable? If your answer is yes, I might be able to work with you. It all depends on you. To further this conversation, you can contact me at mccormick.charlie@yahoo.com. If you are not serious, don\u2019t bother. ",

            "answer_text": "Being rich is relative. But if you are talking about how to have an ample amount of money then here are few tips by which you can fullfill your desire. Spend less- You are poor not because you earn less amount of money. You are poor because you spend more. Decide an amount which shall not be exceeded by you every month. Note down every expenditure you make. This will help you spend less.Bank account with no withdrawal option- Keep multiple bank accounts but there should be one account where you only deposit money but don't withdraw anything. Don't keep any Debit Card for that account. Keep away the cheque book. Use it only when it's emergency.Invest- Be a good investor of your money. Atleast 10% of your earning should be invested. Whether it's a mutual fund or a business, you should learn the art of investing. Read Intelligent investor to know more about investment which brings me to number 4.Read books- Yes, you can spend money on books to earn more money. Books are knowledge, knowledge is a weapon which will make you rich. Read books like Intelligent Investor, the Power of habit, Think and grow richer and many more.Learn to multitask - You need to do more in order to get more. When you start to get comfortable in one work go for another work and perform both of them but (obviously) don't screw both of them up. If you are not able to handle both then don't do it.Buy essentials on sale- Things like toothpaste, washing powder, shampoo, cooking essentials, soap, these are daily essentials. Buy them in a bunch when they are on sale. It will save you a lot of money.Have a routine - Make a list of essential things that you need to do the next day. Make sure you tick every one of those things before you go to sleep at night on that day. Having a good routine will help you do that.Substitute restaurant with Gym/Sport- You need to stay healthy and fit to work more. Avoiding restaurants will save you a lot of money which you can invest on gym or any sports activity to keep yourself fit.Patience- Have patience. It's not a gamble, money won't come overnight. Keep working, love your work and work in the right way. Money will definitely come.Stop procrastinating, implement your idea right now- Ideas are easy but implementation is difficult. If you think that your idea can make you a millionaire or a billionaire then why are you waiting ? You are thinking about starting tomorrow ? Or next week ? Are you still waiting for a perfect time to start ? Or a good investment ? These are all excuses that will never let you start. You should start right now. Keep your short term goals and long term goals written somewhere. Keep reaching your short term goals. Accept failures. You will soon find a path. Read books, learn from the internet. You will definitely reach your long term goal.I am also one of you who is expecting to get 'Rich' one day. I am also following the things that I have mentioned, specially number 10. I was a procrastinator a year ago but I have already decided to go ahead with my idea. ",

            "answer_text": "Becoming rich is no easy task.  Whoever says they have struck it rich and it was easy are probably lying or got lucky.  There are many ways to get rich - mainly 3 that I narrowed down: Oil, Real Estate, and Software.  Well good luck.  Most of this whole experience in Quora is answered by the top guys in the industry.  Am I saying you can't make $$$ doing PPC and organic SEO, of course not.  I will say this, it is a hard road and you better be able to have a great sales background and team up with someone with great skill in SEO, or vise-versa.  My secret sauce is un-like anyone you will see on this site.  I go into low competition industries: Home Service Industry and apply the same logic that makes everything on \"how to become rich\" area of Quora - I just apply SEO, PPC, Mailers, and other tactics that NO one is doing in these industries.  I also apply things from my favorite books: The E-Myth, the ultimate sales machine, Think and Grow Rich, and many others.   Most people will tell you that mail ads don't work, well they still do, you just need to know how to make the right ads.  I have ways of bringing in 7 figures your first year just by doing the stuff your good at whether that be roofing, carpet, drywall, or chimneys.  The same formula exists in all home service industries - I call it the \"Home Service Profit Formula\".   You need to set the business up correctly and make sure you have all the licensing done correctly: taxes, Registrar of Contractor, Bonds, Insurance etc.  Then you need to Generate leads online and offline Then you need the right direction on exactly how to turn leads into booked jobs - interestingly enough, my gal at the VOIP company I use states that only \"47 % of the calls get booked in the home service industry\"  -  I do over 90% Then you need to know how to maximize each in house home service experience - without ripping people off.  I always get great reviews! And Finally, you need to know how to fill your small home service business with RIGHT people. Create checks and balances by using checklists.  Reward the top for doing their job great.   I know this sounds like a lot, but its all pretty simple stuff.  I don't care who you are, if you know how to do a home service profession, you can be rich too by this time next year.  ",

            "answer_text": "I think many people have missed the point and are propagating myths. Let me take the contrarian view to break the myths: Invest for high returns: But who is going to give you high returns? The bank? The stock Market? Your local businessman? Why would someone just give you high returns just because you invested with them. Whats it it for them? Investing your money is therefore always a risk. Higher the risk to your principal, higher the possibility of decent return. That is a standard finance concept! Someone has already made a lot of money by lending money - Morgans for example by taking a lot of risk on their money. Therefore, a well established, well regulated and trustworthy financial system is necessary to ensure the safety of principal and it can promise average return at best. Invest in yourself: That is a good idea for sure. But have you ever wondered how many centuries of work has gone into discovering, distilling and perfecting the information into readily usable form? When you read in a physics or mathematics book, the concepts are readily applicable to create something tangible. So how can some one afford to give all that information in less than $100? Someone therefore has made a lot of money when he invented/discovered those concepts. Thomas Alva Edison did not just invent the light bulb. He sold hundreds and thousands of them through the company he established - General Electric (GE)! Therefore government support is necessary to fund research and give away the information cheaply. Start a scalable business: It is again a good idea for sure. But what makes your business more successful than a corner store. Do you even have the experience. The guy who runs the corner store probably has more business experience and acumen than you. It is usually the first mover advantage that makes a scalable business lot of money. But what if your business does not take off? Remember that 90% of all businesses fail within the first 5 years. Use the power of compounding: How do you make use of the power of compounding? Somebody has to pay you compound interest on your money for a lot of years right? Can you find someone who will agree to do that? ",

            "answer_text": "The best kept secret to becoming rich is, in my opinion, that in addition to building up big income and investing it, you must build up an asset that you will eventually sell at a big multiple of earnings. So you get a triple return on your work: 1. high income 2. the extra income by always living on less than you earn, and invest the rest, and re-invest the earnings of your investments. 3. THE BEST KEPT SECRET TO BECOMING RICH: Your big payday when you sell the business for 3, 5, 8 or even 10 times its annual net income. So you want to own a business you can ultimately sell for the big payday. The big cashout. That\u2019s how you become rich. #1 and #2 are not secret. But gearing things for a big payday by selling at a multiple of earnings is the real secret. It\u2019s the ultimate in leverage. To get rich you need leverage. If you buy a property, the mortgage gives you leverage. If you buy a $100,000 property with $20,000 down and $80,000 mortgage, and say the rent pays the bills and the mortgage and gives you s cash return annually. Great. If the property goes up 10%, to $110,000, you haven\u2019t made 10%. YOu\u2019ve made $10,000 with equity of only $20,000. That\u2019s a 50% return. The leverage also comes from the multiple of earnings that the marketplace considers appropriate for that kind of income-earning asset. If the going capitalization rate is say, 6%, that means that a property that makes annual net operating income (NOI) (it\u2019s before dealing with mortgage payments) of $6,000, is worth $100,000. So if you raise rents $10 per month, that\u2019s $120 per annum in increased NOI. That means that your property is now worth $120/.06=$2,000. If you do that in the 3 units you have in the property, ie raise each one $10 per month, assuming expenses haven\u2019t changed, then you have thereby increased your net worth by 3 X $2,000=$6,000. In a business context, the business might sell for 3X annual net income. Or, 5 X. So if you increase the earnings by $50,000 per annum, you have not only made yourself $50,000 more per year, which you can pay tax on, and invest the rest, you have increased the sale value of the business by say, $50,000 X 4=$200,000. The extra $50,000 got translated into $200,000. Also, when you sell out, your gain is a capital gain and it\u2019s usually taxed at a lower rate than the annual earnings. So that\u2019s another adjunct to the best kept secret. You\u2019re turning income into a multiple of capital, and you\u2019re saving income tax on that gain. ",

            "answer_text": " Massive wealth comes from building businesses from scratch that become wildly successful. While this is a proven formula, most of us aren\u2019t Steve Jobs or Elon Musk. So here are 5 things that anyone can do to dramatically increase their wealth: Earn additional income through doubling down on your job efforts or building extra income with a side hustle. There are dozens of ideas for side incomes and whole books written on the topic. Given that the average North American watches 30 hours of TV a week, it looks like just about everyone can free up the time to do it.Track your net worth. Very simple. What you own minus what you owe. People often say that they want to become rich but don\u2019t measure how they are doing. Start tracking your net worth - look at it monthly for 6 months, then quarterly thereafter. You will see things very differently. More on this here. You can download a simple free spreadsheet to get started here.Slash expenses. Marketers are incredibly sophisticated at separating you from your cash. Stay out of malls, buy what you need. Shop around for every purchase of consequence. Never shop for the sake of shopping. Look at borrowing things, buying things used or doing without. The \u201cfun\u201d of shopping is short-lived and the interests and payments live on forever. Pay particular attention to recurring monthly expenses. In Cashflow Cookbook, I gathered the 60 best ideas to do this. The book is a simple way to check to see if you have covered the major ideas. Learn more here. You can also follow my blog posts with innovative ways to save on everything here. Know what percentage of your income you save or set aside for debt repayment. Set a goal to increase that by 5% within 3 months. Start working on initiatives to get there. Then set a new goal for another 5%.Get your money working for you. Through additional earning and reduced expenses, you can free up cash to pay down debt or increase your contributions to your savings and investment. This is very powerful. Freeing up $100/month and investing the money at 7% for 10 years will get you an additional $17,300 in net worth. Keep it going for 10 more years and you will have $52,100. Doing this for 30 years will get you $122,000. Invest in a well diversified handful of exchange traded funds. If you invest in individual stocks, be sure you look at ones that are positioned for growth in the new economy. More on that here. If you need help, find a well qualified and recommended financial advisor.Learn everything you can about money, saving and investing. Take your first $25 of monthly savings from step 3 and buy a good personal finance or investing book each month and read it cover to cover. Reread each of them every 6 months or so to internalize the ideas. Yes, you can afford $25 a month. Worse case borrow them from your local library.With these simple steps you can retire with many times the wealth of the average North American. Once you build wealth, give back to your community, help others and make the most of your new-found freedom. ",

            "answer_text": "Aside from inheriting money or inventing something and keeping the patent or doing something illegal: the honest, real, most consistent best way to become rich is to work hard, perhaps even two jobs early in life, then SAVE and INVEST your money. EVERY dime you can get. You will not get rich quick, you will get rich slow. Go to any site which offers compound interest calculations, or use a financial calculator, and look at what $5000.-$10,000. per year saved does over time even at a modest 5%. You will have to take some risk. Can\u2019t have your money in a savings account paying less than 1%, it makes compounding ineffective. And, you must avoid taxes and brokerage fees as much as possible, they can quickly knock your net return down so low, that again your compounding does no good. Rental properties may be a good option for you once you have the down payment money, but you need a cushion before going into them- if they are vacant for a while, you still have to make the mortgage payments. I learned more about this from failures than from successes. I LOST a LOT of money trying to \u201cget rich quick\u201d. Most of my friends and family never got rich at all, really did not try. They just bought whatever their paychecks would permit and never invested. But a few, just a few, did what I mentioned earlier- invested wisely, pinched pennies, and now they can afford anything they want, decades later. Only downside to the long term \u201cget rich slow\u201d paradigm is that you do run the risk of dying before you ever get to enjoy your wealth. Only you can make a decision on that. ",

            "answer_text": "Success is a state of mind. Money is a side effect of success. \"We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.\" - Albert Einstein Dream big and have a vision. White down the why behind your goal. This should be meaningful to you. Try with more things until you hit a home run. You need to get inspired by your goal. Your goal should be a mission to serve, to make a difference. Otherwise you are not going to take action. This is the process that will inspire you to take action. It will come naturally as an idea or an urge to do something towards your goal. Invest in yourself first. Read every moment you are free. If you cannot read, listen to audio books. After you read take action and apply the knowledge. Value your time and value the knowledge. Your life should be a continuous cycle of learning and applying. Real education starts after university. Open your eyes and explore your environment. Ideas are everywhere. The problem is not the lack of a business idea. The problem is usually fear and lack of confidence. Try working on that first. We don\u2019t actually do the things we want to do, we do the things we believe we can do. The apparent lack of a business idea is just an excuse for non-action, not a root cause for failure. If we don\u2019t believe we can do it, we just postpone it and come up with excuses to justify our non-action. The problem is not the skill and not the capability, it's the mind. The lack of skill is a direct effect of the blocking disempowering mind. A successful mind will eventually master business execution and stay committed to the higher vision. The moment you stop being afraid of failure, your confidence grows. Experiencing failure first hand sometimes helps alleviate the fear of failure. In order to conquer fear, you need to face it. The root cause of fear and lack of confidence: The social conditioning related to the fear of failure happens during school, up to university. Failure to take an exam is seen as the ultimate individual failure, in a system that promotes individual achievement. After 20 years of conditioning, your mind is programmed in a certain way. If you are \"lucky enough\" to be six figures in student debt as well, welcome to a world of financial bondage and conformity. The perfect tool to kill your entrepreneurial dreams. When you fail, you grow and learn valuable lessons. Don\u2019t be afraid to fail. Stay committed to the process, not a specific idea. Ideas are everywhere, just do something you are passionate about. That will increase your chances of success. Be lean, flexible and pivot. Follow the money and listen closely. The market will guide you towards success. You only have to make it big once to achieve your goal, so keep at it until you do. It\u2019s not what is happening that\u2019s relevant but our internal dialog about it. The problem with that is the social conditioning. We were conditioned to quickly label things and tasks and not to really think constructively about them. That\u2019s what makes them monotonous. The industrial revolution created \"robotic mindsets\" focus mainly on fulfilling pointless and repetitive tasks. A direct effect of that was a generalized creative thought atrophy: Some years ago, the late Nobel prize-winning Dr. Albert Schweitzer was asked by a reporter, \u201cDoctor, what\u2019s wrong with men today?\u201d The great doctor was silent a moment, and then he said, \u201cMen simply don\u2019t think!\u201d - Earl Nightingale, The Strangest Secret (1956) The findings showed: 2% of the people think, 3% of the people think they think and 95% of the people would rather die than think. If you don't believe those numbers I challenge you next weekend to just sit down and think creatively for 8 hours. After 1 hour you wish you would be working. ",

My record week was 128hrs when I was 22, worked a graveyard shift full time and took every shift I could get during the day. When I was at work, I worked my ass off to get noticed as someone that could move up and was promoted often. I learned more game theory along the way and figured out that I will not be young forever and my money could work 24/7/365 which is something I could not. Studied the stock market and real estate before I invested in either\u2026 today I go in the office only because it is who I have become and I enjoy working on something other than my golf swing.

I will give some comparison chart: RICH & POOR : Who dares to enjoy ozone at beach side openly ? If you know its advantages , you will amaze.Who do eat at any place without any fear of getting sick?Who dares to drink river side water, so tasty with out fear of getting sick?Who dares to travel openly ( taxi, buses, trains , flights ) fearlessly?Who do live fearlessly?Who does have patience ?Who smiles having no hiding of not even an iota of bad thoughts ?Who lives happily?Who takes care of family happily ( it mixes all good and bad taste in life)?Who wants to live without ego?Who lives not taking any medicine in everyday life?Who takes care of parents ?Who takes care of children without boarding or custodian?If you view and analyse yourself and say, I am \u201cin\u201d all Qs, then you are rich. Rich my money means, it is purely a materialistic life. When you look only for money to grow and become rich, then you are deviating from human characters ( you can see above points). No one is happy after becoming rich. They do have all kind of sickness and unhealthy life style. Their simple word is, I have no time to take care of all. They are cheating themselves unknowingly. They are consciously unconscious. You live once; so live happily with courage and self confident. You can also refer history of people who are successful in life? Rich people never satisfy with their level of money as rich as every day thought process is, how to get more and more\u2026 There are two valuable gifts from GOD: HEALTHLEISURE TIMEIf above two items are happily enjoyed by any person, he / she is rich in all means.

            "answer_text": "If ask 1000 people I am sure everyone want to become rich but still it doesn't workout for all YES!u Secret formula to become rich that everyone knows but no one knows ! are you confused with my above lines if you are confused then pay attention on my following paragraphs. First let me first let me introduce you to myself I am 20 years old and own 170k* which I made this year from trading and investing in share market and I started this year from 10k. so I am an investor and trader so view will be on share market so how you can become rich by investing in share market. the philosophy is the secret of going rich how do rich people manage their money usually they make their money out of their Investments or we can say out of their assets their asset makes money for them and they pay liabilities and expenses out of the profit all the income came from assets yet if any money left after all the expenses and liabilities they again put that money in a asset they always try to make new assets and looking for investment opportunity because they know one thing difference between a rich people and the poor people is nothing God has provided both equal amount of opportunity and limitations rich people has two hands and 24 hours same as a poor person but what make a rich person rich and poor person is poor is how do they use their 24 hours If you work your own all the way 24 hours with your two hands which is the maximum amount a person can make do you have any answers comment let me give you an example which is a rubbish example but still work just assume that you are a computer manufacturer you manufacture computer all the day and night you probably make around 6 computers in a day I mean in a whole day from the beginning to the end making of computers require a investment amount but we are not mentioning it just keeping our eyes on the return what we get and we sell these 6 computers on the average price of $500 each how we make $3000 in a day by working all the day and night and doing something which is nearly impossible for one person you are hardworking and you have all the skill and you are also able to sell all these computers but still the reward is $3,000 do you think this is enough to live your whole life and make you rich I don't think so even working hard you will become rich you have to think smart and work smart to achieve the goal to become rich Now assume you are giving a work to 10 people who are living near by you you are giving them $100 each to make each computer and the workforce is they make 4 computers in a day each person means you are giving $400 to each person in total you are giving $4,000 in a day what will be your outcome This time you have 40 computers this time you have 40 computers and you sold them for $500 each if we do not include the price of raw material and other thing just assuming that the net expense is $4000 you are making $16,000 and you are also giving job to other people as well sound cool now you see that what will be your future sounds exciting just think now you give this task 200 people and I assume that now you are a company now you started from garage and now you are company who is giving job to hundred people and also making so much more money then usually you are making on your own I remember one quote If you want to go fast go alone and if you want to go long then go with others this was very simple and I am not saying this is a perfect example but this example is enough to understand what I am trying to say you have only two hands and 24 hours borrow 10000 hands and become rich. secret formula to become rich is to empower others so coming to my answer. As I said earlier that I am investor and trader I don't have hundreds of men to work for me so my money is there and every rich person don't put their money in bank account to become rich they use their money and their money make money for them this is for me my money make money for me The best asset in this world is EQUITY most people recommend to read Robert Kiyosaki books Rich Dad and Poor Dad this is just an amazing book because it gives you the financial knowledge and I think as common sense require for living. financial knowledge is also necessary for the good living there is the image that shows how people spend their money there is two different kinds of slow cash flow that show how rich people use their money and how poor people use their money  in first image you can see there is two kinds of cash flow asset and income this is cash flow of rich people they usually make money from their assets and their asset pe all the money they require for expenses and liabilities and the money rest after all this day again put these money into some new asset or the existing asset and their money make money for them and the another image is how a middle class or a poor class people use their income they do job De pay expenses they Pay liabilities and the money they say they put in their bank account this is why people say poor people is becoming more poor and rich people is becoming more rich this is why because rich people knows the secret how the cash flow or the financial system works they have the knowledge that's why they are rich and the poor people they usually just worried about all the things always and there is one more story that can inspire you to become rich one of my friend now he is working as a manager he knows how the restaurant system works and he is now opening a restaurant and well talking to his Chef he ask his save that why don't you open your own restaurant why you are working with this restaurant when you have the skill to cook and you are getting paid more than me probably you must have such capital that is required even I don't have such capital but I am trying to get so and later I will start my own restaurant with this question Chef replies that he don't want to risk A dialogue from one Bollywood movie comes in mind that says if you don't take risk your life become risky yes it's true my friend has no skill to cook something on his own he is just managing actually how his managing that was my Idea which is given to him now he is Managing and taking the work out something but the question is the Chef has the knowledge he was working for more than 15 years in a restaurant line he was getting paid more than my friend he has the skill to cook but still he was not able to start his own restaurant that's because he don't want to risk he do not understand that working 440 years for someone else he is already risking his time people don't understand that time is money and money is time if I am giving you my time is same as if I give you my $100 yes this is true people who don't know the value of time they will always be a poor man he will never going to be rich So how so how you become rich simple answer is hard work + smart work borrow as many hands as you can and always aim for big. dream and work to make your dream come true and any further addition I will edit this answer soon Edited So from all these above answer only something you can drive or you can say bottom line if you want to become rich there is few key points to Remember empower others join hand with others dream big do hard work and create a set and always looking for investment opportunity no matter how much you can afford to invest but invest start your journey and you will see after sometimes that you are becoming rich I am not saying any kind of way that doing this you will become rich or doing that because you will become rich I am just giving you a formula that you can apply anywhere what you are doing I don't care if you are picking garbage or anything anything I mean anything just follow this simple technique or formula that drives from others experience read as many books as you can read biographies of people who has made their own landmark in this world and one of them is Jack ma he comes from when no one can think that's why he has the experience that can teach us so much and so many things he is my idol and I admire him and I listened most of his speeches and you see how many times I failed but still you know where is he ",

Contributing Being parsimonious is imperative, yet it's just a single side of the coin. Slicing your favor cappuccino propensity to spare a couple of bucks wouldn't push the needle for you. While there is a breaking point to have much we can spare, there is no restriction to the amount we can gain. Putting resources into the Market The simplest and the most effective approach to develop the cash you've officially spared is through putting resources into the stock exchange.

On the off chance that you are perusing this you most likely not prepared for land contributing right now but rather you should need to put it on your rundown of objectives. Putting resources into turnkey investment properties can have fabulous returns. Roofstock is incredible, I made a free record and solicited them a ton from questions a year prior to I even began and they were glad to answer every one of my inquiries. On the off chance that you are intrigued, we have a group of assets and podcast scenes you can look at. We cover everything from income to the tax cuts. Take Away: You have boundless gaining potential. The main thing that is preventing you from gaining more is you. Less Stuff = More Money Only a year prior, I stressed over cash constantly. I never had enough cash to carry on with the life I needed, yet I could pay my bills. I possessed a townhouse that ran me close $2,000 a month, a BMW that cost over $400 a month, and a group of stuff within both. I required in any event $3,000 a month just to stay aware of my stuff. At that point, I lost my activity. I expected to minimize my life, or I wouldn't make it. I sold the BMW and purchased a Honda Civic for a large portion of the cost. I leased my condominium and moved in with my more youthful sibling \u2014 lessening my month to month everyday costs significantly. I made a rundown of what was imperative to me and what was definitely not. I sold each unnecessary I could to make additional money. For what reason do you require all that stuff? If I somehow managed to take a stock of my life and decide the things I utilize each day, it would be a bed, a seat, the auto, the PC, a skillet, and a French press. Those are the thing I couldn't live without. Whatever remains of the stuff I seldom utilize. We live in a purchaser's reality. That is the reason we even consider how to get rich brisk. Be that as it may, we don't need to fit in with it. Gathering stuff is only a waste on the off chance that you don't utilize it. You most likely have a house loaded with futile stuff; dispose of it. When I had this epiphany about stuff, everything changed. The way I contemplated cash moved significantly. Do I Need This? In case you're purchasing stuff each day, you have to make a stride back and consider it. I jump at the chance to make a 30-day list on my telephone of things I'd get a kick out of the chance to purchase. On the off chance that I see something in a store or on the web, rather than clicking purchase I simply put it on my rundown. That checks the inclination. 95% of the time, I wind up not needing it in 30 days. I additionally dependably ask myself-Do I require this? Will it improve my life that much? More often than not, it won't. More often than not I can't considerably recall why I needed that thing I put on the rundown in any case. On the off chance that you do need to purchase stuff ensure you get the best cost for the best quality. Take Away: Stuff costs cash. Keeping stuff in your home costs cash. Utilizing stuff costs cash. Less stuff, more cash. ",

Regardless there are a couple steps you must take.  Surround yourself with rich people.  You are the average of the 5 people you surround yourself with. So surround yourself with rich people. Simple enough right? The reason you want to surround yourself with these people are the many benefits you can accumulate from them. Simply by being around them you'll be able to pick up on how they did it. What methods did they use? Did they start a tried and true business or go into something more innovative? Did they do it purely by grinding and working hard or by pure intellect and creativity? The more you're around rich people you more you learn that there are different ways to get there and that your mileage will vary.. a lot.  Learn a skill intensely. Even if its being a jack of all trades.  Making money and becoming rich is a function of value. More value, more money (generally) so you must develop a technique for generating value. Hedge fund managers do so by predicting the markets, sales people do it by getting people to purchase the product and software engineers do it by building a product. No matter what you plan to do you must be able to bring value. So find the area or areas in your life which you have a comparative advantage and pursue that whole heartedly. When you begin to develop value you're begin to develop riches.  Work hard. Very very hard.  The only people to every become rich by not working hard are the people who were handed it through the lottery or inheritance. You will not be able to be rich unless you're working hard. This goes hand in hand with my point above. Lets say you can produce 1 piece of value an hour. If you only work 40 hours a work, well you only produce 40 pieces of value. That just won't cut it. So you must work hard at honing your craft (getting that 2,10,100 pieces of value an hour) and/or producing more of that value (50,60,70 hours a week). Regardless you're going to have to work hard and grind while you can to be able to reach your dreams of being rich.  By surrounding yourself with the people you want to be like, developing a skill which produces lots of value and then working extremely hard towards your goal: you'll become rich one day.  ",

I was listening to Tony Robbins Podcast the other day, you know, Tony Robbins, the guy with 30+ companies and billions of dollars. Tony said the reason why he is where he is today is because of his mindset and actions towards others: serve, give, and help others. Having a service and giving mindset will far outweigh any other advice I could give you. In action this might look like this: You get a job. For a concrete example, let\u2019s say you maintain people\u2019s lawns - either you are a lawnmower, a trimmer, a landscaper, a flower person, something.There are a few mindsets you could have when you go to work:I\u2019m just here to collect my paycheck and I don\u2019t really care about my work and how it looksI\u2019m here to impress my boss so I\u2019ll get a raise and then I can make more moneyI\u2019m here to serve my company and the companies\u2019 clients so that the company will get more work and I will have more work, which will lead to more money for me.The third option will lead to the first and second options, but so few people actually have the mindset of the third case. You start a company, something in the retail (product) spaceYou could come up with a crappy product and sell it to people and make some money that isn\u2019t sustainableYou want money, don\u2019t really care about people, so you just want to take their money and if a crappy product can do that, then that\u2019s how you\u2019ll do it.You could invest in making a great product that many people love and want, which would be sustainableYou want to help people, and by bringing a fantastic product to the marketplace, you are.Providing value through your service to others will help you become rich. Be a giver, serve others, and they will repay you for your efforts. ",

Nobody knows which thing will be a hit, which will be a flop. I write answers here. The answers, I use a lot of research get few views whereas the answers, I don\u2019t expect any view become popular. This is not only my case or yours. Nobody knows, what things bring success and wealth. You can increase your wealth if the method of making money is suitable for your qualifications, wealth and personality. It is difficult to be rich if you are poor. If you are rich, it is easier to be richer. The most popular way to become rich is speculating in the stock market. If you want to do that you need to have a sound economy and the nerves. If don\u2019t have those, you should think other options.  People may suggest you earn money online. Those are empty talks. There are millions of people like you and I trying to make money online. You make some money, but your probability is not that high. I have worked in different small and big companies. I have seen how a small company become a successful international company. I will not go into details of business strategy. I have participated in many courses and meetings. I can tell you with confidence; you will not get promoted because of your education and knowledge. You will do good in your career if you are good in communication and negotiation skills  I would not suggest you risk anything to become rich. Maybe you lose all that you have by trying to be rich. I would rather advise you to improve your communication and negotiation skills. You can train you to be more likable. You need to know how to negotiate. If you can do that, you will be able to make more money. ",

            "answer_text": "Most people who are millionaires are people who have invented something or started some kind of company. If you truly want to be rich, research some people who have done it and figure out what made them a success. Most of the time it is a combination of hard work, recognizing good opportunities, avoiding bad opportunities, taking advantage of natural talents and being persistent. Also, they tend to be resilient- they keep trying even when people tell them they can't or when they make mistakes or have failures. Proper money management is the key. Most people have the means, they just blow their money before the money can work for them. To make money work, you have to save some for that purpose. That means a tight budget which has a portion - 20% is a worthy amount, devoted to \"investments\". These investments can be varied. The key is learning to live on the other portion. There are almost no wives that look at an investment account with $100k in it and don't think, \"Hey, I need a trip to Fiji or a new BMW.\" So just about the time you start getting an amount that can do some real investing, something happens or more specifically someone happens to your investments.   If your parents aren't rich the chances of you becoming super rich are very small. Bill Gates was in line to inherit a fortune before he did the Microsqueesh thing. When your parents can bank roll pretty much any adventure, including a stint at Harvard, you can actually focus on leading edge science and businesses focused on that realm. However, if you are interested, the next big business is in the forming stages. Robotics. The military is going gang busters on getting remotely piloted vehicles, airplanes and sensors. Practical applications, like home vaccums are coming to the market. Personal robots are driving the google mobile. Robotics will be bigger than it is right now and will virtually explode in the coming decades. Knowing how to do robotics will not suck in our collective future ",

But have you ever thought of becoming super rich with some guidance from people who have done it themselves ? I know atleast 3 people who have become billionaires in few years . you just need to get appointment from these people in Lucknow or Patna Mulayam singh Yadav and ClanNetaji was a school teacher and then later on he became socialist leader . Socialism says that all will be equal . Netaji gave his best and people remained poor(equality) . But some strange things happened and his family became a billionaire (I believe it\u2019s a dollar and not rupee billionaire ) See Netaji's son with his shiny new Lamborghini  2. Lalu yadav Lalu jee was also poor and used to stay with his brother in a university campus along with his family . Lalu ji also dabbled in politics and was hardcore follower of Lohia jee . Suddenly Lady Luck smiled and Lalu jee is very wealthy now. I heard that the debris removed from mall construction site was of very good quality and earned him good money by selling it as high quality construction material  3. Behen Mayawati ji . She was a civil service aspirant and then she met Kanshiram jee . Kanshiram jee told her that don\u2019t run after IAS and I will make sure that there will be many IAS who will follow your orders .And indeed , it happened she became CM of UP . With all the blessings from god she is also very rich . Even her statues have Gucci bag as accessory .  So believe in God , yourself and Public of India (pun intended) . I believe if you can meet them you can be rich in no time . There are few other Indian politicians who can grow cauliflower in their gardens and earn half a million dollars per year ( Israel\u2019s PM is also looking for an appointment with them to get this technology ) for all other ways of getting rich please follow Bhagwan Gawai , Kalpna Saroj , Dhiru bhai , Narayan Murthy . But these are boring ways . I prefer the first 3 All pics are from google . ",

            "answer_text": "There are essentially at least 3 tried and tested ways to achieve this: Inherit a reasonable amount of money at a decent enough age and compound itStart investing early enough. Small amounts and get rich slowlyStart your own businessOr do a combination of 2 or 3 of them. Like start your own business and invest on the side. However, remember an important thing. And that is that passive investments beat starting your own business for 90% of people, maybe 98% of people. Not for everybody. If you have been in business for 10\u201320 years, have built up a client base that would follow you, it can be easy to start your business, because you already have revenue and clients ready to follow you. It is only relatively easy as it was so tough in the past. However, nobody likes ideas that sound too `boring`, `tried and tested`. Far better to think you can reinvent the wheel, and start some sexy application or get rich quick. I will give you just one startling statistics. Many studies have estimated that 14% of teachers, yes teachers, in some countries are millionaires:  Now OK, that means 86% aren't. And yes most of the 14% `only` have $1M-$2M. Few are multi-millionaires. However, the reason why I am bringing this up is that few think a teacher can become a millionaire The truth is anybody can be a millionaire on a middle-class income. There are millionaires in all industries:  So, one of the `secrets` is that simplicity beats complexity. Getting a middle-class job, getting good at it, and then starting your own business, will probably beat trying to be the next Zuckerberg. Likewise, investing in index funds from 21 until you die, will probably beat some sexy stock market strategy. You don\u2019t need to invest much to get rich if you start early enough:  All of the techniques take time unless you are lucky enough to inherit a bunch of money. And most of those people end up losing the money!

            "answer_text": "Know that it is hard work, risky and boring but not impossible . Getting rich is simple, you must make more money than you spend then shun all the trinkets and \u2018experiences\u2019 you can buy in exchange for accumulating wealth. Most people can earn more, most people can start a business, most people then really struggle to build wealth because they prefer holidays, nicer cars, larger houses, better lifestyles. Unless you hit super-wealth with a business that you grow to enormous proportions, or inherit a sizeable estate, you are more likely to be in for a long, disciplined, slog to wealth. Say you start earning \u00a320\u2032000 a month. Not hard to do, but this is how it will pan out. As an approximation 25% needs to be retained for taxes. \u00a315\u2032000 per month left. Living costs of a family \u00a35000 per month. \u00a310\u2032000 per month left to become rich with, after a year you could save \u00a3120\u2032000 that will allow you to buy a \u00a3 300\u2032000 investment property fairly easily. That will then create an after tax and expenses income stream of approximately \u00a3500 - \u00a3700 per month. Hmmm, one year of saving to handle maybe 10% of your living costs. Year two accumulate another \u00a3120\u2032000, you have choices, you can pay down your mortgage, always a good move, not exciting, but a solid choice. But again, slow progress. You can invest in stock markets and get a 10% yield or get burned in a crash or correction. For the average person, the route to wealth is a multi pronged attack, get your income up, then build assets and attack debt and cost-of-living-wealth-drains. None of this will happen overnight. Also expect change, a lot can happen in 10 years, it is also rather easy to become successful and rather hard to stay there as other people pile in to any good niche markets you may have found. It pays to be a free thinker, be prepared to invest in the new and unproven and take chances on new markets. Most of us will earn a lot in our lifetimes, not many of us are boring enough to hold on to decent chunks of it. I can be that dull, and I attract a lot of critics from the YOLO crowd. Who knows, I may be wrong! But the YOLO crowd seem to be short on actual answers to me. The other secret is that the people closest to you will either help you stay on track or slowly erode your discipline as they want to spend not accumulate. Be very careful about who you spend your time with. My other advice is that becoming obsessive about changing your life for the better with wealth building is a lot easier when you are young and can get on with it uninterrupted. Good luck! if you found my answer useful, please consider an upvote, thank you! ",

Risk / growth-mindset. The richest big guns have often experienced catastrophic failures and bankruptcies. You don\u2019t have to go for that broke but you do have to not only be ok with loss but also see it as an opportunity to learn and an often necessary predecessor to better things. The areas with the biggest odds of generating wealth (for example, starting your own business [also with the biggest odds of failing], more lucrative investments) have a much higher risk and downside. Grit. Refer back to the above. When you lose your investment, your business turns belly up, funding for your idea dries up, you get rejected a few times or a few dozen or a few hundred (think Kentucky Fried Chicken founder, etc.), you have the grit to keep getting back up for another rodeo. This is hard. Vision. Often, written. Know your \u2018why\u2019 as well. Vision meted out into incremental goals. Treating learning as lifelong. Often, entails networking/surrounding yourself with people you can learn from (\u2018networking is the currency of today\u2019s world\u2019) and reading. And going back to the first point, finding ways to calculatedly throw yourself into the ring of fire, screw up, and get better. Self-efficacy. The belief in what you are doing, and the belief you can get where you want to be. That seemingly simple but Herculean ability to contain the doubting, self-denigrating part of you gives you superpowers. While you are working, don\u2019t forget to find ways (especially early on) to make your money (excess capital, if you have it) work for you. Goes back to points most others already made here. Some degree of thrift especially early on. Honing your ability to communicate. (Learning to sell [yourself, your ideas, products] is one of the most powerful, intangible skills you could pick up. Selling will also teach you aforementioned grit and risk / growth mindset. Working is fundamental. But there are plenty who work hard all their lives and never get close (depending on how you define \u2018rich\u2019).

            "answer_text": "I only know of one really rich guy, I admire him greatly and he is also a very cool guy. But business is business, private is private. If you go into business with him, even in a 50\u201350 partnership, if he sees an opportunity to get a bigger share of the cake, he will do it, he even might make a big deal go sour, just to buy you out of the company, then renegotiate the deal. He has worked for a few companies when he was younger. He saw where the company was badly run, he saw things to improve, so I know of quite a few times where he just bought the company from the owner, no tricks, no bad stuff, just walked into the bosses office and made him a deal. Then he turns the company around, improves it greatly, moves it to a nicer office and so forth. Then he sells the company for a huge profit. I have also seen him fail doing things like that. That doesn\u2019t seem to affect him much. He just keeps on going. I think once you have had great success, it is easy to replicate it. Sometimes though a lot of things happened at the same time to cause you to be one of the persons to get wealthy. One guy in Norway started a mobile operator company, just leased the current infrastructure, so he was roaming in the country. He and his partner got the company running, and through brilliant ways was able to advertise through the media instead of spending huge amounts in advertising. Somehow they got to be the go to persons when news people wanted some input on new phones, new regulations, new prices even what would Apple do. They became the go to guys, even though they were very small in the market. Little by little they got more and more popular, then they were bought out for insane amount of money. That guy thought he knew what he was doing, started to invest in everything, started other companies, in a single day he lost around $500 millions, then little by little he lost pretty much the rest. He did not take into account that probably anyone could get rich at the start dates of the mobile telephone industry. You have a market with almost no one who has such phones, to a strong many millions of people wanting one. Kind of gold rush, and they sold their company before the market got saturated and real competition started. Even though this guy Vollevik is still at it, his partner was more frugal and took care of his money, he also has been unsuccessful at making another big deal. We all see a lot of opportunities, every day. Why isn\u2019t there a store who sells X here ? If only they sold X. Then you see a struggling company with a very ugly store, you think to yourself, I wonder how that store would work if they had better service and looked like a Nespresso store ? I am sure it would look fantastic. Just see a hairdresser who rents a basement and uses a normal shower head to wash hairs, contra a high end salon where you sit in a comfortable chair, nice surroundings. Which one do you think can charge a $1000 per hair work ? And which one charges $10 ? We all see this. But do we act on it ? Do we take out our lifesavings and go for it ? No, most of us don\u2019t do that. Most of us would not work 80\u2013100 hours a week for a year and get no salary to speak of, having nightmares about what to do if you can\u2019t pay salary next month. My friend from the first story, he does this, over and over again. Today he has capital so he is not risking it all, though I suspect that he might do that for the right opportunity, without giving it a second thought. Like I say, he is awesome and he tolerates \u201cgumps\u201d like myself. He always treats my like an equal, he always makes me feel great. I don\u2019t think for 1 second that he only treats me like that. He has that touch. He does this to everyone, and probably when he wants you to feel small, he knows exactly what to do. My favourite story is though of two guys in Iceland who both owned record shops in the 1970\u20131990s, Jon Olafsson and Steinar Berg. They also produced their own records, getting artists and producing stuff. They even got some of their bands on world tours, to countries like China and Russia. Both were very good business people. Jon had a reputation for being quite ruthless, Steinar did not. So one day in the 1990s, Steinar wanted to sell, so he went to the Jon Olafsson and said he wanted to sell. Jon was quick to act and handed him an offer which Steinar thought was very insulting as the story goes and the storms out of the office and probably tells Jon where he can stick that contract. So Steinar, the nicer guy, shops around and ends back with Jon. Jon excuses him self, and says he is sorry for giving him such a bad offer, he shows him the original offer paper, tears it apart and throws it into the trash. Then hands him a new offer, which the nicer guy just shrugs his shoulders and signs the deal. When asked, the nicer guy, Steinar Berg, said it was the same exact deal he was offered, that Jon sure had the balls to do stuff, and he admired it so much that he decided to sign the deal. That is the best story I have ever heard. ",

            "answer_text": " What a way to start the new year, huh? Here\u2019s my answer to this frequently asked question. Disruption Disrupting an industry can make you rich. I loved Hector Quintanilla\u2019s analogy of disruption. Image a soccer field, which must be level. Hence the term \u201clevel playing field\u201d. Now imagine that the field was tilted, and you were able to attack the other goal by moving downhill (while the other team had to go uphill). That\u2019s disruption. So, how to you create disruption? By solving a customer problem far more effectively than someone else, you create a disruption. Think of Uber disrupting the taxi business, for example. Innovation: The Starbucks Example Successful CEOs innovate, and Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is a great example of an innovator. Here\u2019s one example of innovation: The goal of every marketer is to cultivate brand advocates. Zuberance defines a brand advocate as a \u201chighly satisfied customer\u2026who recommends their favorite brands and products without being paid to do so.\u201d (Italics added). In-depth content, comment, meet peers: Join Conference Room. Watch the video, join here. Brand advocates are salespeople who promote your product for free. Think about it: during the holidays, do people mention to you how much they love the Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte? If someone did, that person is a brand advocate. If you ran by Starbucks based on their recommendation, you can start to see the power of the brand. The ability to innovate is a key trait for a start-up- and may make you rich. Filling your Bucket With discipline and time, I think most people can accumulate far more wealth than they think is possible. If you consistently \u201cfill your bucket\u201d by making smart investing decisions, you can certainly become rich over time. But growing wealth requires change- which is precisely why most people don\u2019t make the effort. The changes I\u2019m suggesting involve an old friend: Delayed gratification Some decisions are relatively small: Dropping a subscription music service and just listening to the free version (Pandora, for example).Making coffee at home two days a week, which means that you stop by Starbucks less often.Buying afew more generic products when you go to the grocery store and Target. (I\u2019m not going generic on salad dressing, however).Since these are smaller decisions, the amount of gratification you\u2019re delaying is small. You don\u2019t mind listening the commercials on Pandora (I certainly don\u2019t- I just turned down the sound), and the coffee at home isn\u2019t bad. Other decisions are much bigger. StudySoup wrote this great article on the average amount of money a college student saves by having a roommate. The average savings over four years is over $15,000. Now, having a roommate is a big sacrifice, because you lose a fair amount of privacy. If privacy is really important to you, it\u2019s a true delay of gratification (until you graduate, get a job and can afford to live alone). So, what do I get? OK- so what do I get out of all this delayed gratification? You build wealth- which can give you peace of mind. Someone Who Did It This former co-worker used these concepts to accumulate wealth: \u201cActually, I\u2019ve always lived frugally and saved a lot of my income, so I don\u2019t need to work for awhile\u201d Wow. It was 1999, and I was talking to a co-worker, Ron, who was about 50 years old. A large insurance company we both worked for was merging with another firm, and we were both leaving the company. (I left to start my current business). I had suspected that Ron well below his means, because I had a good idea of how much money he made. Both Ron and his wife worked, yet they lived in a blue collar-type neighborhood with small homes. Ron wasn\u2019t retiring early, but he had enough money to take some time off. He told me that he and his wife had planned financially, so neither of them would need to start working immediately after leaving a job. They planned, they saved aggressively, and invested wisely. This strategy can build wealth- even in times of market volatility. Don\u2019t Forget About Your Credit Score Take action to monitor your credit report, correct errors, and improve your credit score. Read this article to learn about recent changes in the credit score process. How an Annuity Builds Wealth So, back to that idea of consistent investing\u2026 In finance, an ordinary annuity is a series of equal payments made in consecutive periods, and the annual amount you\u2019re able to invest may be an ordinary annuity. You can plug numbers into a future value annuity calculator to find out how much you need to invest each year to reach your $1,000,000 goal. Assume that you invest $10,500 in year one, and that you\u2019re able to increase your invest 3% each year (as your salary or other income increases). They aren\u2019t equal payments, but you still have an annuity. Assuming an 8% annual rate of return for 25 years, you would be darn close to $1 million ($998,486.43). Using this concept is a great tool for building wealth. Read- and Read the Right Books Almost every highly successful person I meet is curious- a \u201clifetime learner\u201d. They constantly look for new information to improve in life, and that includes financial improvement. My favorite book on money and investing is The Richest Man in Babylon. It\u2019s a classic, and an easy read. Ignore the Haters Where you start has very little to do with where you end up. And, don\u2019t be distracted by any haters along the way. Your desire for high achievement will be threatening to other people. \u201cWho do you think you are?!\u201d Just ignore them. Here are three successful people and how they started out: Walt Disney: In 1919, Disney was fired from his job at the Kansas City Star newspaper because he lacked imagination and had no good ideas.Jeff Bezos: His first-ever job was running a summer camp that he founded with his girlfriend.Mark Cuban: Was a disco dance instructor in high school and through his early college years.Best of luck!

            "answer_text": "The process is really quite simple if you study people who have become rich. The key thing to keep mind here is that the vast majority of these rich people did NOT start out by saying \"How can I get rich?\". That being said, there are two things you can do to get rich: 1. Create Value Identify needs other people or businesses have, create a product or service that solves that need and then sell it to them. 2. Find Your Passion Figure out what makes you excited in life, something you are very interested in and get really good at that something then teach other people how to get good at it for a fee or offer it as a paid service to others who need it. Either one of these can get you rich but if you desire to become wealthy, these two things will almost invariably have to intersect. If it's unclear, here is a quick example: Bill Gates did not ever set out wanting to be rich or even an entrepreneur. Bill Gates was passionate about computers and loved programming and developed an exceptional talent. He could have easily become rich just as a consultant however he identified a gaping need for a graphical user interface so lay-people could more easily utilize the power of a computer, effectively aligning his passion with value creation. Eventually Microsoft Windows was created and the rest is history. Don't focus on making money, focus on creating value or finding your passion and the money will follow. ",

            "answer_text": "Start with observing rich people in real life, ask yourself why they are rich and what makes them become rich. Think of the difference between rich and poor people and how their minds work. You'll eventually come to a conclusion that everything starts with the mindset and the rest is result. Rich people are rich because they have a system of thinking that allows, guides and motivates them to take actions resulting in gaining wealth. It's critical to understand how rich people think and what kind of thoughts that lead them to actions. Because if you want to be one, you need to think like one does. Learn the habit patterns and behaviours of rich people and start mimicking that to see how they would affect your lifestyle. Imagine yourself is now a rich person, how would you think? What would you do when you're rich? Actually, you don't need money to be rich, it's how you think that make you rich or poor. Start thinking like one of them now and you'll instantly get rich already. Looking back when those billionaires, millionaires first started their venture, they weren't financially wealthy at day one. Steve Jobs wasn't rich when he first started Apple in his garage, it was his passion and motivation that later made Apple into the world most valuable company, which brought him wealth as a by product. So in order to get rich, you need to start study how rich people become rich and what has worked for them. Learn the history first then start your own venture. ",

            "answer_text": "Funny you should ask that, I just wrote a simple plan on how to do it. Before I go on, allow me to quote Dan Lok: \u201c\"The rich do what is hard, that's why their life is easy. The poor do what is easy, that's why their life is hard.\" Don\u2019t overlook the following for being too simplistic or obvious. There is a 30+ page book out there telling you exactly how to implement the following: Ten Steps to Get Rich 1. Make more money than you spend, a. to ensure you have more than you spend, pay yourself first. Set aside the first 10% of all that you earn. 2. Invest that excess income (that first 10%), first into education, then buy income producing assets. Learn the difference between good debt and bad debt. 3. Change your environment to match the results you seek. 4. Keep your family safe by putting all your personal and family assets into a family trust and get the best insurance, including life and health insurance, that you can get. 5. Start or buy a business. (Don't forget insurance for your business) 6. Grow your current business and/or start or buy additional businesses. 7. Invest in real estate that produces positive cash flow from the first day you buy it. a. You can either learn to do this yourself, or, b. use an app that will match you with others who will invest a small amount to buy real estate or, c. find a service that will invest in real estate for you. You need at least $50,000 in cash for this last option - last time I checked, the price will almost certainly be different by the time you read this but I can't say whether that price will be higher or lower. 8. Get coaches and mentors who will help you along the way. 9. Recruit a top-notch team. 10. Join Mastermind groups. A Mastermind group is a group of like-minded individuals who meet online or in person to discuss those topics they are interested in. I know this seems simplistic and it is. But those who got rich on their own simply followed a core set of principles and let their wealth build itself. Also, everyone has their own way of getting there. Everyone\u2019s path is different, you may follow the same core principles that millions of others have followed, but how those principles manifest in your life will certainly be different. I haven\u2019t looked it up but there\u2019s a book out there with a title like \u201cI\u2019ll Teach You to be Rich\u201d or something close to that. I don\u2019t know the author but you should be able to google it easily. I\u2019ve been meaning to get it. You could also get \u201cThe Richest Man in Babylon,\u201d \u201cThink and Grow Rich\u201d and several Rich Dad(R) books. Please note this is neither legal nor financial advice.

            "answer_text": " Despite blowing millions, the process to becoming a millionaire has been consistent over the years. If you follow these eight priceless pieces of advice, I can guarantee you that eventually you will become a millionaire. Here's to making this happen this year! 1. Develop a written financial plan. One of the main reasons why someone can never become a millionaire is because they haven\u2019t written a financial plan. Developing a financial plan forces you to take action, instead of just talk. It also guides you in making the right decisions in order to achieve all of your dreams and goals. Financial planner Scott D. Hedgcock says that \u201cwhen planning for a more secure future there are two inputs that are indispensable:\u201d how much money you have and how much money you spend. \u201cThe basic point I want to stress about these two inputs is that they are absolutely fundamental to all financial planning regardless of how large either of them is,\u201d he says. \u201cIn my experience, the biggest difference between those on the right path vs. those on the wrong path was the amount of time and effort they put into devising a plan for their finances.\u201d When you take the time to create a plan and see it through, \u201cis the one thing all financially successful people have in common.\u201d Hedgcock also says that \"the success experienced by those who do this occurs regardless of their relative wealth. Likewise, the failure of those who do not follow a plan is unrelated to their wealth.\u201d When creating a financial plan, consider the following: Focus on what matters most and don\u2019t obsess over the past.Focus on what you control by listing your known expenses first in your budget, and then with the income leftover you should list the discretionary categories.Focus on your future by anticipating how much your future self will need to survive.Related: Designblaz Design Your Life for Success Awesome Helpful Blog & Course 2. Focus on increasing your income. \"In today's economic environment you cannot save your way to millionaire status,\" writes Grant Cardone, who went from being broke and in debt at the age of 21 to becoming a self-made millionaire by 30. \"The first step is to focus on increasing your income in increments and repeating that. \"My income was $3,000 a month and nine years later it was $20,000 a month. Start following the money, and it will force you to control revenue and see opportunities.\" Thankfully, you have several options to boost your revenue, like investing in high ROI businesses and side hustling.

Take advantage of Uncle Sam\u2019s generosity. \u201cThe best way I know to become a millionaire is to put the power of compound interest on your side. By giving your money more time to compound and keeping your rate of return as high as possible, you greatly increase your chances of reaching a seven-figure net worth,\u201d writes Brian Feroldi on The Motley Fool. \u201cOf course, earning a high return on your nest egg is easier said than done, as many factors to create that return are outside of your control. However, all investors do have control over two huge factors that can put a serious drag on long-term returns: investment costs and taxes. If you want to become a millionaire, focus on keeping both as low as possible.\u201d Feroldi goes on to write that if you have \u201ca 401(k) or 403(b) through work, then any money you contribute to the account can grow tax-deferred, allowing your money to compound more quickly.\u201d He also suggests opening up a traditional or Roth IRA, because they \u201ckeep Uncle Sam away from your money, either now or later.\u201d You should use a broker or brokerage firm \u201cthat charges very little per trade -- and not to trade too frequently.\u201d \u201cIf you want to become a millionaire, you need all the help you can get,\u201d he says. \u201cMaking sure your investment fees and tax bill are as low as possible will go a long way toward helping you achieve your goal.\u201d Related: Designblaz Design Your Life for Success Awesome Helpful Blog & Course  4. Increase your streams of income. After studying millionaires for five years, author Thomas Corley discovered that 65 percent of self-made millionaires had three streams, 45 percent had four streams, and 29 percent had five or more streams. This could include starting a side-business, working part-time, investments, and renting everything from your home to your car to household items. Related: Designblaz Design Your Life for Success Awesome Helpful Blog & Course 5. Automate your savings. If you want to become a millionaire, then you absolutely need to get into the habit of saving by contributing to your 401(k), Roth or traditional IRA, and an emergency fund that\u2019s been placed in a money market. However, the way to make this is by automating your savings. This will automatically withdraw a percentage of your salary and place it into your contributions without you ever seeing it. It\u2019s suggested that you should put 10 percent towards investments and 5 percent towards savings. Related: Designblaz Design Your Life for Success Awesome Helpful Blog & Course 6. Upgrade your skills and knowledge. \"Read at least 30 minutes a day, listen to relevant podcasts while driving and seek out mentors vigorously,\u201d writes Tucker Hughes, who became a millionaire at just the age of 22. \u201cYou don't just need to be a master in your field, you need to be a well-rounded genius capable of talking about any subject whether it is financial, political or sports-related. Consume knowledge like air and put your pursuit of learning above all else.\" Related: Designblaz Design Your Life for Success Awesome Helpful Blog & Course 7. Live below your means and lay-off the credit. It\u2019s widely known that the wealthiest people in the world are frugal. They don\u2019t spend excessively on designer and luxury items. They use coupons. And, they\u2019re known for living below their means by purchasing modest homes and vehicles. They\u2019re also known for keeping their debt under control by using credit sparingly. Take a cue from T. Boone Pickens, who only carries around as much cash as he needs for what he intends to buy. Related: Designblaz Design Your Life for Success Awesome Helpful Blog & Course 8. Associate with millionaires. \u201cIn most cases, your net worth mirrors the level of your closest friends,\u201d writes Steve Siebold for Business Insider. This isn\u2019t exactly a new philosophy. It\u2019s been around ever since Andrew Carnegie embraced the Master Mind principle. \u201cExposure to people who are more successful than you are has the potential to expand your thinking and catapult your income,\u201d says Siebold. \u201cWe become like the people we associate with, and that's why winners are attracted to winners.\u201d \u201cThe reality is,\u201d he says, \u201cmillionaires think differently from the middle class about money, and there's much to be gained by being in their presence.\u201d  For more Related: Designblaz Design Your Life for Success Awesome Helpful Blog & Course ",

            "answer_text": "Building wealth \u2013 it's a topic that sparks heated debate, promotes quirky \"get rich quick\" schemes and drives people to pursue transactions they might otherwise never consider. \"Three Simple Steps To Building Wealth\" may seem like a misleading title, but it isn't. While these steps are simple to understand, they're not easy to follow.  The Steps Basically, building wealth boils down to this: to accumulate wealth over time, you need to do three things: You need to make it. This means that before you can begin to save or invest, you need to have a long-term source of income that's sufficient to have some left over after you've covered your necessities.You need to save it. Once you have an income that's enough to cover your basics, you need to develop a proactive savings plan.You need to invest it. Once you've set aside a monthly savings goal, you need to invest it prudently.Actually, We all know how to be rich. We know that we should make money and save it hence invest it. But it is very unlikely that we will follow these steps with high enthusiasm and dedication. Making money requires a very strict discipline. That;s why, most of us will never become too wealthy. SO, If you want to become wealthy:- Make Enough Money ( both passive and earned money)Make a Financial PlanCreate a target salary. How much money do you want to create? Until when? Set goals. Pay your debtsDon\u2019t Stay in debts. Don\u2019t buy anything in credit? Choose your friends circle carefullyYou become whom you spend time with. Choose high paying careerStart your business",

            "answer_text": "There isn\u2019t one road to becoming wealthy. But there are several trains that wealthy people tend to have \u2013 traits everyone can learn from (which I first wrote about here)\u2026 1. They\u2019re diversified The idea behind diversification is simple. It means putting your eggs in different baskets. That is, spreading your risk across different types of assets, so that a decline in value in any one holding isn\u2019t so bad \u2013 because there will likely be other holdings that rise to help balance out the losses. But diversification goes beyond just holding a number of different assets\u2026 what about your \u201cpersonal equity\u201d? Is it diversified? Equity is what\u2019s left after you add up the value of everything you own, like stocks and stamp collections and your flat. Then you subtract what you owe (on your mortgage or to the taxman or your ex-spouse, for example). What\u2019s left is your net worth, or your equity. So when I say \u201cpersonal equity\u201d, I\u2019m talking about a much more broad definition of your assets \u2013 financial and personal and professional experience and prospects and earnings power\u2026 personal equity is about how you\u2019re going to build your equity in the future. It\u2019s about where you\u2019ll be earning your living \u2013 adding to your savings \u2013 in coming years. Where is your paycheck coming from? What other sources of income do you have? Where is your professional network \u2013 and how strong is it? How transferable are your skills? How many languages do you speak \u2013 and how easily could you work in a different country? Rich people diversify their assets across markets and sectors\u2026 and they diversify their personal equity across businesses, countries and currencies. So if the banking sector goes bust\u2026 their home currency massively devalues\u2026 the real estate market crashes\u2026 or the government starts searching for ways to plug a massive budget deficit, their assets are safe. They\u2019re flexible, financially, professionally and personally. 2. They learn from others If you want to be a successful at anything, the first step is learning from other successful people. This is true whether you want to learn to fix a car, make chocolate chip brownies, or burp a baby. It\u2019s also true when it comes to investing. Rich people take a look at what other successful people have said and done\u2026 how they\u2019ve overcome struggles\u2026 the mistakes they\u2019ve made\u2026 and the wisdom they\u2019ve gained. Understanding how others have succeeded can dramatically shorten your learning curve. Rich people talk to someone who\u2019s done it all before, and who knows what to look for, and what works and what doesn\u2019t work. So if they\u2019re new at real estate, they might talk to someone who\u2019s been doing it for a long time. Experience is a great teacher. But as an investor, learning the hard way can turn out to be a very expensive lesson. (I\u2019ve certainly done my fair share of learning, as I wrote here, when I lost US$50 million of other people\u2019s money.) So instead of learning from your own mistakes, look to generally successful investors who\u2019ve succeeded, and how have made some mistakes along the way, and learn from them. 3. They find their own way People tend to follow the herd. It\u2019s human nature to think that if the majority is doing something, then it must be the right thing to do. This crowd, or mob, mentality is one of the reasons that market bubbles form. Everyone gets excited about a stock or an industry, the media starts talking about it and prices skyrocket. You don\u2019t want to miss out, so you jump on the bandwagon just as prices are peaking\u2026 and you end up losing big. It can work the other way, too. When a market starts to fall, the crowd sells everything because it\u2019s worried about heavy losses. You panic and follow suit, solidifying your loss. So just because everyone else is doing it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the right thing to do. Rich people know this and they find their own way. That isn\u2019t to say that contrarian investing is always \u2013 or even sometimes \u2013 the right way to go\u2026 it\u2019s easy to take contrarian investing to an extreme. Defying everyone else and conquering your gut instinct, which is telling you to run in the opposite direction, is sometimes supremely profitable. But some investors interpret any bad news, or market correction, or stock decline, or literal blood on the streets, as good news in disguise. That kind of attitude \u2013 knee-jerk contrarianism \u2013 is a great way to lose a lot of money, because sometimes \u2013 and maybe even most of the time \u2013 the boring, plain, they\u2019re-all-saying-it conventional wisdom is, in fact, correct. There are contrarian traps everywhere. Rich people make sure they don\u2019t fall into them, by assuming that what \u201cthey\u201d say \u2013 the conventional wisdom \u2013 is automatically wrong. Instead, they make up their own minds \u2013 instead of just following or rejecting the conventional wisdom. 4. They pay attention to what they pay A fantastic asset that is expensive may be a lousy investment. And a lousy asset \u2013 beaten up, poorly managed, a terrible history \u2013 may be a fantastic investment. Rich people know that the price they pay, more than anything else, will determine whether or not they wind up making, or losing, money. And they know that a high quality asset doesn\u2019t always generate to high returns\u2026 and that a lousy asset that\u2019s on the right track to improvement might be a much better, if riskier, investment. And price matters. Study upon study has shown that cheap beats expensivewhen it comes to profiting from markets. In the stock market, one of the best ways of measuring value is to use the cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (or CAPE) ratio, which smooths out short-term price fluctuations. Investing in markets that have a low CAPE, on average, results in much better returns than buying stock markets with high CAPEs. Of course, this is the same for stocks\u2026 all else being equal, your odds of making money improve when you buy a stock that\u2019s cheap, rather than a stock that\u2019s expensive. In the short term, anything can happen to the price of an asset. More people rushing in to buy an already-expensive \u201chot\u201d stock will push the price up higher. And negative sentiment towards an out-of-favour market or stock can mean that it takes a while for a cheap asset to rise in price. But in the end, price will prevail. 5. They use the power of compounding Compounding is the most powerful force in finance. Albert Einstein is said to have called it \u201cthe greatest mathematical discovery of all time\u201d. And it\u2019s probably helped more people build wealth than all the other investment strategies in the world put together. Compounding is a simple idea\u2026 in short, it means reinvesting returns instead of spending them. Over time, the original investment gets bigger and bigger as more returns are reinvested. It\u2019s like a snowball rolling down a hill. The further it rolls\u2026 the bigger it gets. For example, if I invest $10,000 with an annual interest rate of 5 percent\u2026 after 12 months I\u2019d get $500 in interest. But instead of spending that $500, I reinvest it on the same terms\u2026 now I\u2019m earning 5 percent on $10,500. So 12 months later I\u2019d receive $525 in interest, which I again reinvest\u2026 and on it goes. Just like a snowball, the investment is getting bigger every year. And I\u2019m earning interest on top of interest. In the short term, that doesn\u2019t sound like a lot. But now look at the magic of compounding over several decades\u2026 and the more decades, the better. If I started investing when I was 25 years old with an annual investment of $20,000 (and I reinvested the interest each time) at 65, I\u2019d be sitting on a nest egg of about $2.5 million. But if instead I\u2019d started investing the same sum each year, on the same terms, at 35 (rather than 25), I\u2019d have about $1.1 million less when I retired \u2013 because compounding has had less time to work its magic, as the graph below shows. That\u2019s a huge difference.  So when it comes to compounding\u2026 time is the secret to success. Starting as soon as possible and reinvesting interest over several decades can build life-changing wealth. Individually, none of these traits will make you rich. But if you combine them, they can help you become a successful investor \u2013 and wealthier.

Maximize your earning potential If you want to become wealthy,, you will need to concentrate on settling on profession choices that will enable you to earn more money. Improving skills to build your profile and acquire more pay is key to getting to be rich. Is it time you ask for a raise? Are there better-paying openings you should be looking at? Ask yourself as to whether you would have the capacity to earn more with a degree or qualification in your field and give your best to whatever activity you're doing. 3. Have multiple streams of income It's difficult to depend on a 9-5 work for your whole job with layoffs and pay cuts every now and then . With multiple streams of income, you can abstain from putting all your investments tied up on one place \u2013 and use several streams of cash to grow rich. 4. Create passive income Passive income is when you keep on getting paid after the work is finished. This includes commission from books, films, or songs and furthermore income that originates from real estate or business ventures where you don't need to be available to gain it. 5. Taking Calculated Risks In case you're serious about getting to be rich, you will need to venture out of your comfort zone.Traditional way, such as having a job is more secure.Try not to give fear a chance to keep you down.Wealth often comes through taking calculated risks.

            "answer_text": " People get rich by following a good strategy and creating value for society and the world. An investment such as investing in stocks or bonds may seem like you\u2019re putting your money in a slot machine which in fact you\u2019re stimulating economic growth by investing in companies which allows them to use your money to create real products and services on a mass scale. Ideas are everywhere but did you know that only 1 out of a thousand ideas actually becomes successful ? This is because three are many steps in getting running a successful business or creating a good investment portfolio. The business life cycle is as follows; 1) Idea stage 2) Business Validation stage 3) Startup stage 4) Growth stage 5) Expansion/optimisation stage 6) Exit/Transition stage If you take a look at the \u201cGrant Life Cycle\u201d if you\u2019re looking for a LOAN or GRAND, you\u2019ll see that the process is as follows; 1) Generating your idea 2) Finding funding 3) Developing your proposal 4) Submitting your personal Proposal 5) Award negotiation & Set-up 6) Managing your Award 7) Closeout Project Running a business is a complicated process and many people find that they are working harder running their business then they did when they had a regular job. 16 hour shifts are not for everybody and a business often requires multiple minds coming together in a harmonious way, with common long term objectives and good synergy amongst each other. So this is the dilemma that many experience.. it is SOO hard to find a good partner to work with, if you go ahead and read partnership stories, you\u2019ll find that most of them are negative. Now you can run the business yourself however in the book \u201cThe E-myth\u201d, the author talks about 3 distinct personalities coming together and putting their skills on the line to run a succesfull business. We have; 1) The entrepreneur 2) The manager 3) The worker And each of the 3 persons have their own strengths and their own weaknesses. When you have money you can actually PAY people to fill in the other 2/3 roles, those rolls have skills which you lack, and unfortunately most startups just don\u2019t have the capital to make it big. Sob y now you might believe that you cant start a real business without money, and its not that you CAN\u2019T.. its that its really hard to find because three is SOO much competition in a area which has no barrier to entry. A get rich quick scheme that has no barrier of entry usually last a VERY short time before the masses find out about it and before the scammers roll in with bogus promises. If you want to take the other route, where you want to invest, you must also be cautious and educate yourself before laying your money down. Here is the investment cycle; 1) Plan 2) Invest 3) Conceive 4) Evaluate You have to first of all be aware of your biases as an investor and recognize that you 3 common emotions which interfear with your ability to make good decisions, and they are; 1) Fear (Selling at the wrong time) 2) Greed (Buying at the wrong time) 3) Revenge (Buying or Selling at the wrong time) You also need to be able to manage your portfolio correctly by using technical and fundamental indicators and successful traders have years of years of experience which often even they had felt the sting of loses in their early years. The learning cycle to become an investor is long\u2026 to become a successful swing trader\u2026 or even day trader the learning curve is much longer. The rich people aren\u2019t always the smartest people, but rather they hire competent people with unique skills to do the work for them. I myself have been trading for not too long\u2026 only a year and a half\u2026 recently however I let a friend of mine named Gregory trade my account and he managed to 4X the money it in only a few months. He trades and holds the positions for weeks before he exists them. Swing trader\u2026 weekly trader.. if you wanna call it. I\u2019ve started with 7500$ and it\u2019s now over 28,000$ in only a few months. Unbelievable right? When unlike the other guys who talk a big game, I actually have yearly statements to prove it. Gregory is a professional trader and he's been trading for 12+ years and has lots of experience trading futures, CFD's, Commodities & Currencies\u2026  Interesting I know.. and here's a statement from a friend of mine who turned 50k to 77k in 3 months  At this point my friend has over 120k in his account, which is 140% profit in 6th months time.. not bad I believe? I really have nothing to hide and can provide more statements or even access to my personal trading account if you wish.

You have to alter your life style, develop few good habits and reinvent yourself completely inside to attract outside waking up in Bhrahma muhurta time Early morning, the period of Brahma Muhurta, where the so-called reality, waking state has not become 100% real for you and the dream state has yet not become 100% dream state for you, where, you are just moving in-between. Brahma Muhurta - morning four-thirty to six, where your inner space, some moments is in waking state, some moments in the dream state; make use of that time to infuse some ideas into your system. For example, you are feeling life around you and inside you, is very poor, you are not having enough resources; you want wealth. Try to play, early morning that four- thirty to six, infusing yourself with the idea, \u201clet me manifest wealth\u201d. Your visualization should be more towards wealth; not towards moving away from poverty. Please understand, if you say, \u201clet me move out of poverty\u201d, you will be all the time visualizing poverty. No! Move towards wealth, visualizing wealth. The first thing will happen, when you consciously play with your Brahma Muhurta consciousness; that is a unique consciousness. That is a unique time and space, where, you are neither fully awake nor fully sleeping, nor fully dreaming. You are like a, original material out of which you are made, is available for alteration, transformation, manipulation. The material out of which you are made is available to yourself at that moment. You can alter your cognition's or wrong ideas about wealth at this time. Literally your mind, your though currents can be changed Just few days, his one week, every morning, this Brahma Muhurta time, try to play with your consciousness. you can work on even your health. You can work on your relationships. You can work on your fulfillment, feeling alone, empty, lonely, on anything you can work. Try to visualize, what you want to manifest. It will not take more than three or four days for you to realize, actually you are setting the trend and thought current. You are setting the trend and thought current of what you want to express in that Brahma Muhurta time. Sleeping during the time means wasting your life. Do not entertain do not entertain the thought currents which are not directly conducive for your life, at those moments, because, whatever you entertain during that time will become part of you. Have patience then when you practice this, you start attracting people, situations, cognition's, your whole brain rises to wealth consciousness, then plan your life accordingly. 2) Maintain balance sheet before going to bed , you have to know your net worth totally, every day do it as a ritual this will create more WEALTH CONSCIOUSNESS and attract wealth 3) Be in company of people who are rich consciously and read books 4) Start doing whatever you like with out worrying about monetary gains or result of your work 5) straight simple hardwork and later evolving into smart strategies ",

Rs 1 lakh, Rs 2 lakh, Rs 5 lakh \u2013 any guess? Money begets money \u2013 this is what is generally believed. In other words, this means that the more money you have and you invest, the more wealth you will be able to generate. (Reuters) Money begets money \u2013 this is what is generally believed. In other words, this means that the more money you have and you invest, the more wealth you will be able to generate. This is also true, to some extent. However, this is not entirely true. For, it is not only the amount of money saved or invested, but also your wisdom and the propensity to save that makes all the difference! Can you, for instance, imagine how much money you will be able to make over 40 years by just saving, say, Rs 50 a day and investing that amount every month in a saving instrument that gives just 8% return per annum? Rs 1 lakh, Rs 2 lakh, Rs 5 lakh \u2013 any guess? Nah, that is a staggering Rs 52.25 lakh, if the interest on your investment is compounded quarterly! Of this total amount, only Rs 720,000 is the principal amount while Rs 45 lakh is the interest earned. That is the power of compounding \u2013 \u201cthe eighth wonder of the world,\u201d as described by Albert Einstein. However, this is not all that easy do do. For this, you need a disciplined approach towards all your financial matters and consumption habits. Here we are taking a look at 5 easy ways that can be done: Cutting Back on Eating Out: These days many people, especially working ones, avoid cooking at home and love eating out. True, giving yourself and your family occasional treats or eating out sometimes is not bad. In fact, it has become essential in today\u2019s world for many reasons, one being that it helps you spend quality time with your friends and family. However, eating out regularly is not only bad for your health, but budget also. If you are able to save, say, only Rs 1,000 per month by cutting back on eating out, and invest the sum in a product that gives you 8% return, then this will help you generate close to Rs 5.92 lakh in 20 years. If you save Rs 1,000 for 30 years, then this will become Rs 14.94 lakh and in 40 years you will be able to accumulate around Rs 34 lakh! Is it bad?Paying Bills on Time: All of us pay various bills every month, which include phone bills, electricity bill, gas bill, credit card bill, school fees, and maintenance bill (if you are living in a society), among others. We are also aware of the fact we have to pay late fees if any bill is not paid on time. However, how many of us pay our bills on time? The fact is a lot of people pay Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 every month as late fees alone and they have no regret. The problem in most cases is not of money, but of laziness. However, even if you are able to save, say, Rs 500 per month by paying your bills on time and the same amount is invested, then you can make big money over the long term. For example, Rs 500 invested every month in a saving instrument which yields 8% return, can generate around Rs 17 lakh in 40 years! Avoiding Impulse Buying: We all love to shop. However, do you often purchase something and then get it home to find you aren\u2019t excited about it any longer? Or that you just don\u2019t need it? It happens with most of us. Therefore, if you are in the habit of spending on impulse, make an effort to have a moment of reflection before buying anything. If you are able to save just Rs 2,000 per month and invest the same every month in a saving instrument which yields 8% annual return, then it will help you generate around Rs 70 lakh in 40 years and around Rs 30 lakh in 30 years! By Quitting Smoking: We all are aware that smoking is injurious to health. If you are also a smoker, but are now looking to quit smoking, then try to keep aside the money for every cigarette that you do not smoke. If one cigarette costs, say, Rs 10 and you usually smoke 20 cigarettes a day, then you would effectively set aside Rs 6,000 in a month if you successfully manage to quit smoking completely. Invest this amount every month in a saving avenue which yields 8% annual return, and it will help you generate around Rs 2 crore in 40 years! Taking \u2018Spending Freeze\u2019 For a Week: Another important way to save money and keep a quality budget is by going for \u2018spending freezes\u2019 or taking a \u2018no buy\u2019 break for a week. This means during such periods, you won\u2019t buy anything new or go shopping. Exceptions to the \u2018no buy\u2019 time might include paying for medicines, food and emergencies that come up like someone getting sick. Save the money you would have normally spent during the day or week you are on the \u2018no buy\u2019 break and invest that amount by the end of the month. This will also help you generate a big amount over the long term  Sources: Google ",

            "answer_text": "In life different people have different perspectives about what constitutes being rich. Most may attribute it to money. Some to fame . Some to some form of social standing and such. And some a perfect amalgamation to one or more of such forms. Now, as in becoming rich you need to constitute what you think makes your life tick, what gives you the most satisfaction among the various distractions and all in this vast space . After you or anyone else completes this identification process comes the part when you learn ways to etch a path out or figure out ways to reach the perfect summit which you have decided to scale. Now personally I haven\u2019t personally become rich as such being still a guy just about to get into college and start adult life. But reading a bit and seeing a few people around me have made me truly believe that to be rich you need to actively lodge your entire mental resources to where your heart truly lies. Believing as to your question actually relates mostly to monetary wealth, living a simple clean life and pursuing life goals honestly and smartly will take you to the farthest you were supposed to go and then some if you continue to strive to an ever increasing range of goals you\u2019ll soon start processing once you reach a frame of mind which sets you to work, live , love your life and your profession and so reach heights which you possibly didn\u2019t think you could. And lastly never forget to dream and take note of criticism and criticizers cause then you\u2019ll get a will to strive beyond and above all of it and reach true bliss. Hope this helps . Cheers, and good luck !!! :) ",

            "answer_text": " I'll start by saying: \"Ask and you shall receive\" Now, you say you want to be rich. Lets first evaluate what you even mean by \"rich\". Is it emotional richness? Richer relationships? Richer lifestyle?  Look, I'll cut to the chase. We all know you were talking about money. Which is fine. There is nothing wrong with that. But you have to do two things for me: A) Be SpecificLet me go back the quote I mentioned in the beginning. Here's the thing, when you say \"I want money\" you're not being specific enough. The quote shouldn't be \"Ask and you shall receive\". Really, it should be \"Ask specifically and you shall receive\".  Look, give me your bank details and I'll shoot you $100. That's money. In a relative sense, to some people, they may even consider that being rich.  Let's be real though, you don't want $100. You want millions. Tens of millions.  You need to define that goal.  \"I want 1.75 million dollars in 5 years. I am going to get there by [fill in the blank]\" Again don't \"[fill in the blank]\" with generalities.  \"I want 1.75 million dollars in 5 years. I am going to get there by working hard\".  NO. Be specific.  \"I want 1.25 million dollars in 5 years. I am going to get there by saving X amount of dollars every month and spend only Y amount of dollars on clothes every year.  I  will become junior partner in 2 years and work a second job for the next 12 months. At the end of this year I will have saved $150,000.\" You can't be lavish in earning your first million. You have to be frugal.  B) Rise and GrindIf you want to capture the island, burn your fucking boats. You want to know why? Any person who is given the choice between dying or succeeding, will most likely succeed.  Now don't take this literally. What I'm saying is, you need to find that motivation. Find that drive. What's going to push you to the next level? Work like there is someone working 24 hours a day to take it away from you.  You need to wake up early. Go to bed late. Stick to your vision and beyond all else, be specific in each goal necessary to take you to the next level.  Best of luck! Luca ",

            "answer_text": " By earning money, living frugally and investing the majority of what you save. Rinse and repeat over a decent time frame and then you should have enough to be rich. A few steps to achieve this: Don\u2019t save what you don\u2019t spend; spend what you don\u2019t save. Save as much as you can every month and have a separate savings account that you put, say, 50% of your salary into as soon as you\u2019re paid. Change your lifestyle to achieve your saving goals, not the other way around.Use whatever tax free savings solutions are available to you - such as an ISA in the UK - as this can boost returns by over 20% per year.Don\u2019t keep up with the Joneses. Here\u2019s the God\u2019s honest truth - they don\u2019t care. Nobody does. If your friends judge you on the car you drive or the neighbourhood you live in, get better friends.Invest well - diversify your investments and use low cost options such as ETFs instead of managed funds (the returns work out better due to less charges).Give it time. The average long term return from stock market investment is 8% per annum. Becoming rich takes time and patience. The toughest part of becoming an overnight success is usually the first two decades. Investing $2000 a month over 20 years with an 8% return will net you over $1.1m. The more you save, the more you\u2019ll make.",

            "answer_text": "This is answered easily by asking yourself: How do I become poor? Spend more than you earn. Pay premium prices for brands just to show off. Get a loan for a car you can\u2019t afford. Eat out as much as you can. Never save any money, making sure you have barely enough on every payday. Do not invest for the future. Do not shop around and negociate for a lower price when your buy something. Do not get a side gig and never ask for a raise. This is how your average person goes from middle-class to permanently stuck in consumer debt. Of course, some people are born in a poor environment and have all the odds against them all the time. Others are born rich and never have to worry about money. But if you plan on becoming rich, start by not doing any of the things that will make you poor. It\u2019s easier said than done. There are exceptions, but wealth is generally built slowly over the years. You can become rich if you play your cards right. Some even manage to become rich when they\u2019ve been dealt the worst cards. Good luck and thanks for the A2A! ",

            "answer_text": "I will try to keep this post very clean so that you can understand and relate in a better way. This post is for anyone who wants to become rich in a short / long span of time :  Step 1 : Analyse what are expenses ? Expenses can be anything but you have to divide between mandatory and optional expenses. Mandatory expenses include rent, electricity, wifi, maid, water bills whereas optional expenses include shopping, netflix, din-out. You can cut back only on the optional expenses and not on the mandatory expenses. Step 2 : Analyse what are your goals and save accordingly ? Goals can be short term and long term for which you can select funds accordingly. A more volatile fund for a long term goal whereas a stable / less-volatile fund for short term goals. You can increase the savings rate every year along with your salary, suppose you get a raise of 5k / month. You can open up a new mutual fund tagged with a goal or increase an already existing one to achieve it faster. Step 3 : How much is your worth? What are you being paid on an hourly basis if employed or business. You can use the 2X rule to check if the salary is justified or not, which means if your work experience is 5 years then your salary should be at-least Rs 10 Lakhs. If you are falling below this that means you have to upskill yourself and learn new things. Step 4 : Learn the power of compounding? Compounding is generally termed as the 8th wonder of world in financial institution & i believe in it too. You should know that Warren Buffet earned 80% of his wealth after an age of 50 , so you are not late and you can start today in this journey. Step 5 : Consistency is the key to being a millionaire ? Yes after a research done by vanguard (USA) they found millionaire Index Funds owners in their books but who are these people? they are the ones who are dead , which means they invested the money and left it their to grow a million times.  Bonus Step : Don\u2019t follow any of the steps above and let\u2019s meet 20 years from now, we will review each and every point in here. Radhakishan Damani once said \u201cThe opportunities getting created in the next 20 years will be better than the last 30 years. So invest and reap the rewards\u201d.

            "answer_text": "So apparently, some folks have made the long trek to Dharamasala, India, waiting for days to get an audience with the Dalai Lama to ask him this one question (\"How do I become rich?\") And from what I've read, his response is a good hearty laugh and then the response of, \"Give away everything you have!\"   So that's the unadulterated dharmic perspective.     I can't speak for myself, but I watch my father who's made millions as a business man, and I see the same principle at work.  He's one of the most generous people I know.   Upon retiring, he's spent the the past 10 - 15 years volunteering for the Japanese-American community with just about all his free time.  From watching him, he spends about 40 - 60 hours a week volunteering his time.  When the Japanese experienced the earthquake and tsunami in 2011, he led a campaign that raised nearly 1.5 million dollars on behalf of the victims. He's also donated blood every other month for the past 20+ years.   So that's what I see: generosity begets wealth.     There's also a different kind of wealth, right?   I've been inwardly rich.  I'm at peace with myself most of the time.  I attribute that to the fact that I've tried to be generous with whatever insights and learnings I've gained through my own spiritual pursuits and practices.  I've freely given away and shared with others whatever inward accomplishments I am able to share and offer to others.  Within reason, of course.   This kind of inner peace is a form of wealth.  If you want to feel rich, you can either increase what you own, or you can decrease your desires.  Or both.  The latter is important too.     Another kind of \"wealth\" is a sense of emotional safety in this world.   Some people lose their temper easily.  They dump and vent their frustrations on anyone around them that they feel they can.  None of those people I know has any deep sense of emotional safeness in this world.  In other words, they lack emotional abundance, if you will.   So sometimes I run into people like this.  In just about every case, I think of getting angry back at them, and before, I used to.  Or at the very least, I would try to argue back.   Or \"point something out\" to them that they don't seem to be seeing.   But for the most part nowadays, I don't.  I just let them vent, and if I can find fault in myself, I tell them about it.   If I sense that reasoning with them won't get anywhere, I don't bother.  If I feel the need to say something, I will, but most of the time, they're just wrapped up in fear.  So, I just try to think of something nice to say, and if I need to walk away, I walk away.  I try to let them \"win.\"   It doesn't feel good for me afterwards most of the time.  I'm not a saint.   But I think of this as a form of generosity.  Emotional generosity.  They're basically scared and want to feel safe.   And my upset feelings pass anyways.  It's not a big deal.   Almost always, they realize what they've done afterwards.  Half the time, they apologize to me.  Or I see their look of shame around me in the days following.   It rarely happens a second time.  They know that I'm safe.   What I get in return is that my world feels safe to me.  I live in an emotionally safe reality. That's part of my wealth.   So it's the same principle: (emotional) generosity begets (emotional) wealth.     So if generosity is the root of wealth (or one is willing to entertain that idea), a good starting question might be, how do I grow this capacity for generosity? I'm not sure the answer, actually, because I don't think it's simply a matter of brute-forcing one's way with generosity.  And I can't just follow the Dalai Lama's suggestion, nor do I want to (yet).   But one important partial answer for me has been this: I try my best to surround myself with people who are generous and open-hearted.   Why? Because (1) they inspire me to be similarly generous and open-hearted and (2) it feels good to give to them, which motivates me to further continue sharing what I have to share.   Without those people in my life, I think that I would eventually clamp down.  Slow to a trickle.   An example: It sucks (to me) to keep opening and holding the door for people who don't seem to show any appreciation.  If that's all there were, I'd likely stop doing it.  But there are enough people in this world who say \"thank you\" and keep me motivated in doing that.   And that's what the people I hold close to me do for me.  They receive what I have to offer, which keeps me motivated to giving and sharing, even if many others don't receive what I have to offer, or show any appreciation. They remind me of the goodness of sharing.  Of being kind.  And so on and so forth.  They're the constant reminders of a particular way of being.     Naturally, it's not simply a matter of the people around us.  Most of us are happier when we're able to find whatever talents and capacities we have to bear upon the world around us.   So it's important to look for that because things are constantly changing.  We're changing and so is the world.  The whole thing is in flux.  And so one can't stay fixed on some form.   And yet the intent is to find ways to give, to help others.      I always love reading what James Altucher writes.  He says these things much cleaner and better.  But I have to say it in the way that I can say it.  (Please forgive the errors in editing.  Or better yet, please suggest edits where needed.  I'm always grateful for improvements.) ",

            "answer_text": " 1. Stop obsessing about money. While it sounds counterintuitive, maintaining a laser-like focus on how much you make distracts you from doing the things that truly contribute to building and growing wealth. So shift your perspective. See money not as the primary goal but as a byproduct of doing the right things. 2. Start tracking how many people you help, even in a very small way. The most successful people I know -- both financially and in other ways -- are shockingly helpful. They're incredibly good at understanding other people and helping them achieve their goals. They know their success is ultimately based on the success of the people around them. So they work hard to make other people successful: their employees, their customers, their vendors and suppliers, because they know, if they can do that, their own success will surely follow. And they will have built a business -- or a career -- they can be truly proud of. 3. Stop thinking about making a million dollars and start thinking about serving a million people. When you have only a few customers and your goal is to make a lot of money, you're incented to find ways to wring every last dollar out of those customers. But when you find a way to serve a million people, many other benefits follow. The effect of word of mouth is greatly magnified. The feedback you receive is exponentially greater, and so are your opportunities to improve your products and services. You get to hire more employees and benefit from their experience, their skills, and their overall awesomeness. And in time, your business becomes something you never dreamed of, because your customers and your employees have taken you to places you couldn't even imagine. Serve a million people -- and serve them incredibly well -- and the money will follow. 4. See making money as a way to make more things. Generally speaking, there are two types of people. One makes things because they want to make money; the more things they make, the more money they make. What they make doesn't really matter to them -- they'll make anything, as long as it pays. The other wants to make money because it allows them to make more things. They want to improve their products. They want to extend their lines. They want to create another book, another song, another movie. They love what they make and they see making money as a way to do even more of what they love. They dream of building a company that makes the best things possible... and making money is the way to fuel that dream and build that company they love. While it is certainly possible to find that one product everyone wants and grow rich by selling it, most successful businesses evolve and grow and, as they make money, reinvest that money in a relentless pursuit of excellence. 5. Make it your goal to do one thing better than anyone. Pick one thing you're already better at than most people. Just. One. Thing. Become maniacally focused at doing that one thing. Work. Train. Learn. Practice. Evaluate. Refine. Be ruthlessly self-critical, not in a masochistic way but to ensure you continue to work to improve every aspect of that one thing. Financially successful people do at least one thing better than just about everyone around them. (Of course it helps if you pick something to be great at that the world also values -- and will pay for.) Excellence is its own reward, but excellence also commands higher pay, greater respect, greater feelings of self-worth, greater fulfillment, a greater sense of achievement... all of which make you rich in non-monetary terms. 6. Make a list of the world's ten best people at that one thing. How did you pick those ten? How did you determine who was the best? How did you measure their success? Use those criteria to track your own progress toward becoming the best. If you're an author, it could be Amazon rankings. If you're a musician, it could be iTunes downloads. If you're a programmer, it could be the number of people that use your software. If you're a leader, it could be the number of people you train and develop who move on to bigger and better things. If you're an online retailer, it could be purchases per visitor, or on-time shipping, or conversion rate.... Don't just admire successful people. Take a close look at what makes them successful. Then use those criteria to help create your own measures of success. And then... 7. Learn how to trade stocks and options in a right way with a very low risk. ",

What accumulates value over time paintings:gold, diamonds, shares etc. What produces the most money:companies, houses, investments. What hardly available example Truffles, pearls, uranium. What you can have in a monopoly or at least with narrow access barriers, for example, who wins a contract in the Public Administration, who has a qualification that few people have, who has a license that is difficult to obtain Knowing how to do what few, can do you know why commercial aircraft pilots take such high sums? Because few know how to do it and it is expensive. Do what few do do you know, why gravediggers funeral agencies make a lot of money? Who wants to do it? Who would be a neurosurgeon? Having what gives you access to things that are closed to others. There are forms of investment excluded for most human beings, where at least 1 million euros is needed to enter is the business of the rich, and others to things like Power.

Not Taught by our Parents or Friends or neighbors because they are not rich, don\u2019t know to become rich or they do not want you to be rich. High Income Skill: Learn a high income skill. Its not about getting a high paid job. Its a skill for which you can quote and earn money, which you can increase often by creating value to the client/ customer. Continuously improve on your skill to quote higher price and earn more money. If you are in India, you should have a skill to earn at least Rs. 7,50,000 a month (Approx. $10,000 a month). Until then you can wait to go into step 2 or 3. until then invest your time and money in improving your skill. Once you hit the goal of High Income Skill.

You know how to make $10,000 a month. You have good cash flow to invest as an entrepreneur. It is time to leverage on Time and Money. You are ready to invest by hiring talents and expand your business.

You will not be a Millionaire (Approx. 7- 7.5 crores) in 25 to 30 years. Some cannot even have a net worth of Rs. 1 Crore while they retire. Take time and think these questions Do you want to spend less and become so called rich in 40 years or learn that high income skill and live rich every moment? Do you want to fight with your spouse to save Rs. 500 over the weekend or Take her to the best destination every half yearly? Do you want to downsize your dream car or up-size your dream car?  The above steps will not let you stop at a Million. \u201cFormal education will make you a living; self-education will make you a fortune.\u201d \u2014Jim Rohn ",

There are tapes, books, courses, videos on the internet that can help you with that. you job is to get you thinking about it, and your mind will begin seeking solutions. There are paid programs and they are worth it. Then you start learning how to manage money. If you can budget $1000, then yo will know how to budget $1000000. Then try to find a gig you can do, and which you can eventually scale. This is not easy staff - I ran small business since 2014 -2015 and it is very difficult to scale because whole business depends almost solely on my skills and knowledge. That is not good - it must be able to operate as much autonomously as possible. If you can find and suck up to a rich person, become useful and help even as assistant and learn about how they make money - that\u2019s useful. I learned quite a bit from my bosses. Alternatively, you may find someone rich and marry him or her. But then you have to have marital relations, and that may be even more difficult then everything else I wrote above. It really worked like a magic when I tried it for a few years. I met new people, I got new clients, I got lots of work flowing my way. I was amazed. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a lot of good suggestions here but the one underlying principle that makes one rich is the ability to generate money without any major input of additional time. So you have to create a \"money machine\" somehow. The idea is to work once and get paid over and over. This is how recording stars, movie stars, authors, and even business owners get wealthy. You have to multiply your efforts somehow otherwise you are simply exchanging hours for dollars.  You will never get rich by exchanging hours for dollars because you only have so many hours and there is a limit to how much you can charge per hour. But there is no limit to the number of \"money machines\" you can create once one is churning out money simply move on the the next. Brian Leyde gave an example on this post of how he creates money machines through Amazon products. The reason it works is not because of the system he uses but because he is multiplying his effort with every new product he launches.  The only other form of money machine that works, requires money to start with. That is investing in stocks, Bonds, etc that generate income for you, so once again after the initial investment no work is required. But it requires time and that you understand investing and not lose your capital. ",

Be it a medicine, way of doing something better or helping people reach their goals. Since you are a woman I would like to show you how some women got rich. There is another way of becoming rich like some people do especially politicians by promising good things and then show that they are doing good whereas all they are doing is using national or international resources. I would say that they don\u2019t innovate much but show big things to people of their country to become rich whereas the actual job is being done by policy makers.  There are plenty of other ways also to become rich. Become a businesswoman. Employ people at low wages, exploit them abuse them. Make them do all the work until you become rich. For example Gina Rinehart but she inherited most of it from her father and then took it further. So yes one can become rich by inheritance too.  One can become rich as a celebrity as well. Become an eye candy and rule the world. You won\u2019t be rich yourself but then rich people would like to have you around them. Thus you can enjoy the richness through them. So in this case it will depend on how much one can manipulate them.  One can also become rich by hosting a talk show. Invite celebrities, rich and famous to the show. And show the world how good they are and what\u2019s going on around in their life and Entertain the Masses. BTW one has to be really innovative in this too and has to have good presentation skills and yes pretty talkative with good vocabulary.  Then you have Many of those opportunistic women who just wait for their prince who makes them rich and famous as soon as they marry them.  Oh yes you will have to be presentable and will have to work day and night building Public relations and also run a lot of charities. It\u2019s like a show biz but with a royal touch and then your private life is gone. There is another similar way of becoming rich. Marry a highly intelligent person who is going to be rich in future stick to him in good and bad times until he becomes rich and thus making you also rich. Talk about all the billionaire wives and they did exactly that.  If you think you are hot enough one can go get some racy photos and even leak their own private videos thus gaining instant fame and becoming rich. Also boost your family\u2019s image by putting everyone on a TV show.  One can also become rich by getting involved in some type of sports and winning heaps of money in championships. But then you will have to be the best at it.  So these are few ways of becoming rich. All of these people never had a perfect life but are definitely rich one way or the other. For me rich are the ones who leave a legacy by their innovation, dedication and thinking. So for me it will be someone like Florence Nightingale who revolutionised the modern day nursing.  So choice is yours and depends on your definition of being rich. You might do altogether something different and in the process become rich so don\u2019t look at ways of becoming rich rather find ways of becoming rich which I believe you are. ",

            "answer_text": "What is interesting to me about the responses are that more than 25% of the answers are not really answering questions but post something to benefit themselves (affiliate marketers, their own website, etc) while the rest of 75% probably come from those who are not wealthy themselves but somehow \u201cknow\u201d how to become wealthy. I would not say that I am wealthy myself, so I confess that I cannot really give a legal advice. However, I can still give a shot by categorizing how people in certain groups became wealthy. You get luckyPeople in this category include those who inherit the wealths (in South Korea, we call them \u201cthey are born with gold spoons\u201d) or get a jackpot/win a lotto, or something. The wealth in this group comes purely based on chance, which you have no control over probably. And no, I would say investing (or throwing away) your money on Powerball is a terrible idea. 2. You build the wealth by yourself As others mentioned, this will take some knowledge, skills, or some methods. And I know the questioner wants to know about this. Well, let\u2019s look at it in a realistic way. How much money do you need to earn or to have to be considered wealthy? Would you say earning about $200 k per year considered to be wealthy? Well, if you are young, simplest way is to go to good MBA, PhD, investment banker, lawyer, or medical school to get a job that pays over $200 k per year. Are you too late for that? No problem. Build a business and make the people work for you. If you get hired by somebody, the chance is that you will never make more than a certain amount because there are only few jobs that gets paid over a certain amount. But if somebody start working for you, let\u2019s say each of your employees generate $100 k worth of productivity. They get 70% of the amount while you get 30%. You may say, \u201chey, I am only make 30K while they get 70k!\u201d That is okay. Did I say you only have one employee? Let\u2019s say you hire 10 employees. You make 300K (30K x 10) while your employee makes 70K each. Did you get the idea now? This is how everything in capitalism works. ",

            "answer_text": "SO MANY WAYS. It's incredible. I used to think that \"if only I had one good idea I would be set!\" That isn't the case at all. I have new ideas all the time. It really just comes down to: \"Do I have the time, energy and passion to actually make that succeed?\" Sometimes the answer is yes, often it is no.  James Altucher has a concept of \"Becoming and Idea Machine\". It's fantastic! Every day, before you start your morning, come up with 10 ideas about something. Anything 10 Ideas to Improve Amazon.  Or 10 Ideas to make money in 6 months.  Or 10 ways to say thank you to someone without using the words.  Literally, anything. This will work out your brain muscle because the first 3-5 are always pretty easy, but coming up with those last 3 are very tough. Sometimes they are silly. Sometimes you combine two other answers to make a new one (Altucher calls this idea sex and its brilliant) Why this works is because it gets you to start thinking creatively all the time. You will walk into a restaurant and think \"If I were the owner I would change this and that, and create more value.\" There is a show on ABC called Shark Tank Would-be entrepreneurs pitch their idea to a group of investors and they decide whether or not to invest. Watch this show! What you will learn is that the investors rarely care about the actual idea. They always invest in the person. Just a 30 minute pitch you can learn a lot about someone. The words people use are so crucial! A bad or lazy person with a great idea is worthless. A hard working person with drive and passion will eventually succeed.  Concluding Thoughts: When it comes to starting a business, don't worry about trying to found the next Apple or Facebook, instead determine how much money you actually need each month just to pay for your expenses.  Find a pain point in society. A problem that hasn't been solved yet or something that needs improving.  Solve that problem. The more people you help and the more value you provide the more you will be rewarded.  Facebook serves over 1 billion people daily. It makes a lot of money.  Can you serve a few people daily? A few hundred or thousand? The answer is yes.

            "answer_text": "Hello Dear i am Shweta Gupte Forma Chennai . I Suggest you how to Become Rich Mans Simple Way .The most effective method to Become Rich in 5 Easy Ways. Money is Very Important for regularly life and every person need extra money.because without money life in not En-joyful and through money you can complete won every dream as you wish in whatever. The vast majority, if not we all, need to live in money related solace and steadiness. We need to be rich, to have the option to purchase anything we need, and to approach a top notch way of life. While the ultimate objective is clear, it's difficult to tell where to start your excursion to being well off. Before you begin, it's essential to recognize that turning out to be rich requires some serious energy and exertion. There are not very many approaches to in a split second have a lot of riches, and every one of them are karma based. Not we all can win the lottery or acquire a fortune from a puzzling rich family member. Getting wealthy as a rule includes a ton of difficult work, tolerance, and time. There are some time tested things you can do that can assist you with getting rich, yet the key is to continually and reliably buckle down, monitor your own funds, and keep your focus on the awesome end goal. 1. Start a Business If don,t have a Extra money now . so you started Small Business .This is a lot more difficult than one might expect, yet the last four stages lay the basis to have the option to go into business. On the off chance that you have a skill for business or need to work for yourself, this can be an incredible advance to profiting. Be that as it may, the same number of business people will let you know, making your very own business requires huge forthright expenses and low income at the outset. 2. Include Value Something numerous independent well off individuals share for all intents and purpose is that they are significant in explicit manners. In any event, when tycoons and very rich people are removed from the condition, numerous rich individuals \u2014 specialists, engineers, movie producers \u2014 have gotten rich in the wake of increasing the value of themselves and afterward enhancing the world. For instance, a rich neurosurgeon might be uncommonly gifted and talented. This specialist enhanced the world in the wake of improving their own aptitudes and personal satisfaction. Increasing the value of yourself is a decent establishment to start your excursion to being rich. Build up some information or abilities that legitimize somebody paying you a decent measure of cash. Persuade individuals that you merit a huge check since you will increase the value of their lives consequently. 2. Duty Yourself The idea of setting aside cash is definitely not another one. Nonetheless, it is incredibly simple to \"dunk into your reserve funds\" when you need something seriously enough. The way to achieving your objective of storing up riches is to really attempt to set aside cash. An alternate perspective on investment funds is to see them as charges. When you cover your expenses, you never recover the entire sum. Treat your reserve funds a similar way. Put cash aside in an investment account or move it to an absolutely discrete record where you can't contact it. Treat your investment funds like cash that you will never get back, until the day that you get everything back simultaneously. 3. Make a Plan and Follow It The probability of out of nowhere discovering boundless wealth is incredibly low. While it might appear that a ton of the examples of overcoming adversity you hear are karma based, this is really false. There is presumably some opportunity and karma included, however most rich individuals got rich through careful arranging and control. This incorporates things like spending plans and courses of events, just as an arrangement of what to do at all times. It is significant not to get self-satisfied and put forth a valiant effort to continue onward, and having an arrangement helps without burning through superfluous measures of time. Making a spending limit and tailing it is just a single piece of this procedure. 4. Contribute The center standard behind contributing is that you wind up getting more cash than you spent. In any case, it is imperative to pick your ventures astutely. There are a lot of spots for you to sink your cash into, however making sense of which one of these will bring about you benefiting is troublesome. Land is once in a while a wise speculation, however it is costly. Putting resources into the financial exchange doesn't need to be costly, however it tends to be unsafe and insecure. A 401K is an insightful venture that you ought to put resources into, however it can rely upon how well the business you work for is doing. There are a lot of elements to think about when contributing, so ensure you consider it objectively. Converse with specialists or companions who are knowledgeable about contributing before settling on a choice. Thank You ",

People will have a rather \u201clive experience\u201d where users can shake hands in their social network compared to just thumbs up or like.People will have the opportunity to not just hear but \u201csee\u201d the band playing and \u201chear\u201d the music while at the comfort of their homes.People can experience being in the audience or see the DIY in near life quality while just watching and free roaming (literally see from any angles).People into gaming can play with their friends and have a custom weapon activated in VR where they can do anything like RPG or even MMORPG.People can shop and either flick or swish a hand to choose anything they want while seeing their augmented self wearing or using the items.People can \u201cshare\u201d their experience by recommending it to other users where they also experience the same thing.People can have a selfie/groupie photo or video taken with other users in any place without actually going anywhere.Friends and family can finally see and share every moment, like be on their virtual side, and not have to type anything.And a whole lot more.Once this service is launched, people who connects to whoever is on this platform can literally do everything.

            "answer_text": " There's a story of an Italian Billionaire who, when asked what he'd do if he had to start over from scratch (I searched Google 50 times to find the original without luck), he replied that he'd take any job to make $500, buy a nice suit, then go to parties where he'd meet successful people. The implication was that he\u2019d meet someone who'd offer him a job, share an opportunity, etc. I'm almost 40 and of the 5 career type jobs I've had in my life (I run my own business now), 4 came through networking. Only 1 came out of applying to a job listing. But networking isn't something you just go out and do. It's immensely more effective if you have simple people skills. And when I say simple, I mean spend a couple hours reading Dale Carnegie's \"How to Win Friends and Influence People.\" Read that and try it out at a party and you'll be blown away by how effective it is and how after meeting and talking with a few people and asking them about themselves, how they'll want to help you, without you asking them. When I asked my old boss (who was the most remarkable sales person I've met), what he did to improve his sales skills, he told me that right out of college without any skills or pedigree degree, he took a job as a limo driver. He was reading \"How to Win Friends and Influence People\" and thought it would be worth trying out. He would ask his customers one simple question when they got in the limo, \"So tell me about what you do.\" That simple question resulted in a huge increase in tips he received. Notice he didn't ask his customers, \"What do you do?\" There's a subtle difference. If you ask the latter, many people will just tell you in a few words what they do. If you ask the former, it's an invitation for them to tell you their story. Few people will turn that down. At one point early in my career, I was doing research in the medical field and realized I wasn't interested in it or where it would lead. I wanted to make more money and get into the business side of things (this was right after the tech crash in the San Francisco area), so I spent nearly 9 months relentlessly applying to jobs, writing cover letters, researching companies, but met with no success. I was doing it all wrong. One night, my roommate asked if I wanted to go to a party. Sure, no problem. We went. I didn't know a single person there. At one point, everyone did shots. I wandered back to the kitchen to get a beer. There was one other guy in the kitchen and I introduced myself. We talked for a while, I asked him what he did and he said he worked in biotech. I mentioned I was looking to get into the field, and he said his company was actually hiring. My resume got sent to the hiring manager, and I was interviewing within a couple weeks. You can guess what my next job was. There are a million paths to getting rich. And there are countless people who've gotten rich who are jerks, tyrants, manipulative, conniving, and all around assholes. When you're working in different industries, you'll start to feel that all the successful people are this way. But in reality, these are only the people who leave the most lasting impression, not because they're the only people who succeed. But there's unlikely anyone out there successful who wouldn't emphasize the value of people skills in succeeding. So back to your question, how do you get rich quickly: The high level: Learn relentlessly. Read books and books on success, people skills and anything that might have some inkling of a strand of wisdom about success and wealth. Especially read the biographies of successful people. In his autobiography, Mark Cuban talks about how he would buy and read any book on business that he thought might help. The $15 he'd spend was a fraction of the worth of the wisdom he picked up. Drew Houston of Dropbox talks about how he would spend every weekend reading books on business, sales, marketing, all day long. Every weekend.Become a people person. This is a learnable skill or set of skills. No one is born a great salesperson. There may be people (like athletes) with better inborn abilities (outgoing, etc). But the best learn, read, study, and practice. Relentlessly. A lot of times, those with the best given talent don't end up being the top in the field because at the start, it came easy to them. The ones that have to work at it, work relentlessly and don't ever get complacent. And then one morning, they wake up and the effortlessness at sales or marketing or leadership that they never thought they would achieve, they now embody.Work hard. As an employer, one of the things that stands out the most with employees is a good work ethic. It's worth its weight in gold. Drop your expectations and ego, and put your nose to the grind and good things will happen.Take risks. Not dumb, fickle risks and not gambles. But smart, calculated risks where you have a good chance at succeeding. You won't always succeed, but you will learn a huge amount in the process and you will garner an enormous amount of respect from people in doing so.The nitty gritty: Get a job in a high growth industry. This is where the quick money and the opportunities are. There's a saying how everything rises with the tide. When you're in a fast growth industry (or company), the tide is rising.Work for the best and most recognizable company you can work for. This gives you instant credibility. Starting as an intern at a recognizable company will get you opportunities right away.Become an expert. Pick an area within your industry and learn it inside and out. Start writing answers on the topic in Quora, start a blog on the topic, network with other experts. You'll find pretty quickly that this type of knowledge and expertise will lead to a huge array of options.Create multiple income streams.Start writing, consulting, tutoring, fixing things, just get busy with a second source of revenue. This will get you hungry for more and you'll double your learning. You'll see that a job, tutoring on the side, can lead to starting your own tutoring company on the side. Your marketing consulting job can lead to writing Amazon books on marketing.Be too busy to spend money. Feel like you spend too much money? Feel like you don't save enough or at all? Get busy working on everything, your job, learning, networking, consulting, projects, side jobs, overtime at work and you'll find out you won't spend a fraction of the amount of money than before.Finally, start a company. Name a billionaire who didn't start a company. Yes, there are a few. But they ended up running the company they joined (Sheryl Sandberg, Steve Ballmer, Eric Schmidt). Starting a company may seem completely out of reach and unfathomable, but when you've done all the preceding steps, it will be the most logical next one. Successful companies don't start out with 50 employees and a $10M in revenue, they start out small, tiny and scrappy. They start out in their dorm rooms or their parents' garages or spare bedrooms. The founders beg, borrow and steal to get what they need. Michael Dell started his company by hacking together computers in his dorm room and selling them. Walmart started as a single variety store in Newport, Arkansas. Ever hear of Newport, Arkansas? Yeah, me neither. Richard Branson started out selling records by mail, one at a time. Don't look at the most successful people and companies and see where they ended up or you'll be overwhelmed. Look where they started and you'll see how it's achievable#Rich #Wealth #Money #Forbes #Business #Success #Growth #Market #Power #Name #Big #Most #Best #Highest #Company #Group #Billionaire #Successful #Career #Leader ",

            "answer_text": "My oldest daughter came in my room last weekend, flopped on the bed, and said, \u201cHow do I get rich and famous?\u201d I asked her why she wanted to be famous. \u201cWell, if you get famous, then people want to do stuff for you, and they give you stuff, and you get all kinds of cool free things.\u201d So, I asked, is the point of being famous to enable yourself to be rich? \u201cYeah, pretty much.\u201d Okay, then the real question is: \u201cHow do I get rich?\u201d We could spend some time talking about what it means to be rich (we have). We could talk about how money has symbolic value only and means nothing of itself (we have). But the question she was asking is valid, an intent we can all understand: How do I ensure that I have what I need, materially? How can I set up my life so I\u2019m not riding the struggle bus? What do I have to do to live in abundance rather than scarcity? And then I surprised myself by having an answer: Create value. \u201cWhat\u2019s valuable?\u201d Anything can have value. In a sense, everything does have value of some kind. But unique, thoughtful, deep, skilled work has more value because it\u2019s helpful, meaningful, and rare. Pick something you can do, something you like doing enough to do it every day. Then consistently work on it. Make stuff. Share it. Give it away, at first. Practice and practice, but don\u2019t worry about hustle. Practice to improve your skills. Practice to get better at the thing you like doing. Practice for flow. Keep doing this, keep making stuff, keep sharing stuff, and people will start showing up. At first, it won\u2019t be many people. Your family. Your friends. A few bored bystanders. But then more people will show up. They\u2019ll be interested. They\u2019ll have opinions about what you\u2019re doing, and why, and how you should do more of it or less of it or in a different way, or how you should market it or promote it or expand it. Ignore them, mostly. Keep practicing. Keep doing the work, keep making the stuff, keep sharing and giving most of it away. Start selling some of it. Then sell more. If you can find ways to duplicate what you sell, so your focus can be on creating rather than copying, that\u2019s even better. Focus and be consistent. Create on a schedule. Share widely. Sell selectively. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the whole deal. There are endless variations. There are infinite distractions. The details don\u2019t matter. The focus matters. The consistency matters. The value matters. The details will be forgotten, but the value you create\u2014the wealth you give the world\u2014will have an impact, and it will return to you. ",

            "answer_text": "Purchase a mini van. Convert it into a mini food truck like this.  you may think that there are already many in ur city but it's all about timings, location and knowings. Do your 1st shift from 8\u201310AM , as office and class timing are in this time lap. Just sell 2\u20133 type of rolls or food that can be carried away and consumed even of someone is in hurry. Because in India everybody is in hurry. 1 roll's cost is hardly 12\u201315\u20b9 and you can sell it easily for \u20b940. I recommend to sell it for \u20b940 because it will make you gain some positive words of mouth for affordable price and students can also afford such price. Rest from 10.30 to 12.30 . Then start preparing basic things again for next shift. 2nd Shift : 1PM-3PM . As it is lunch break. You can go for dishes with minm. effort . Like fried idli, fried rice. 2\u20133 kind of sandwiches. 3rd Shift : Main shift. Sell normal Dishes with fancy names. Which looks good in pictures. Youngsters now a days believe more in show off then taste. Just a normal Maggi pack of 12\u20b9 + butter 5\u20b9 . Add some coriander to it with few pieces of onions. And your can sell it easily for \u20b9 50 with tha name of Cheese Onion Maggi. Add egg to it cost \u20b95 . Increase in price \u20b920. Just scramble egg while preparing. And name change should be like Scrambled Egg Cheese Maggi \u20b970. Infact you can go only with Maggi dishes also in starting . Your location matters a lot. In morning you have to park on the way which leads to maxm office and classes. People skips breakfasts just because they are getting late. Hand them a roll for \u20b940 or \u20b950 with some filling . You can also tie a poster with \u201cBreakfast is most important meal of the day\u201d written on it. In evening park where maxm hostels or pg's are there. Students need something to bite on in evenings. Keep experimenting with offers too. Like 2+1 free. Or 10% bill off above 150\u20b9 order. It keeps consumer in interest and they will stick to your truck only. Suppose you sell 50 rolls on an average in 1st month. So 50rolls * 40\u20b9 * 30days = 60000\u20b9 40idlis+ Rice dishes and one dish cost 40 so 40 dishes *40\u20b9 * 30 days = 48000\u20b9 50 Maggie+Sandwiches : 50 * 50\u20b9 * 30days = \u20b975000 Total Earnings (we took minimum sales quantity) = \u20b9180000. All the best. And in case you get rich contact me. I will invest my share too. :) ",

Or (B) Sourabh Arora, Inspector, Customs Have you voted for option (B)? Not unexpected. Most of readers will vote for that and this post is for those readers only. Actually this is a social perception which is rooted in our brain from our schools to family that only a job (a reputed job preferably) can make you able to survive. Parents and schools push children to get good grades so they may get placed in good company or government job whatever. With no surprise Parents even businessmen don't want their children to be a businessman. Means most of the businessmen themselves don't feel proudy what they do and doesn't want their children to do what they do? Yes. Because 78% of indian entrepreneur / businessmen are businessmen because they couldnt get a job or are not qualified for a job. Actually we feel proudy being an employee but not in being an employer. Everyone wants to be an employee. Want to work for an organization. Want to make rich his organization. Because this job pays their bills. They are loyal to their job because they cannot survive without paychecks they receive from employer. Because society will not accept them if they don't have a job in hand. Actually employees work for money. Even a business man who is working on his business (9 to 5 or more) too is an employee. He is not doing business instead job in his own business. They are part of rat race. A race for running behind money. People don't want to get out of this race and they don't dare to disobey the social perception. They are being taught in school and family that life is all about a rat race. And this fear makes them employee of money. Contrary to this, rich never work for money. Even money works for them. They are employer of money. To be a rich you will have to raise yourself from the mentality of being an employee. Be an employer, employer of money. Yes. You shouldn't work for money instead money should work for you and you will be millioner billioner whatever you dream. ",

            "answer_text": "How can I become rich? Hard work. Sacrifice. Persistence. Discipline. Some people will wake up and win the lottery, some people are born with more than they will ever need, and that's good for those people, but the rest of us are going to have to work for it if that's what we want. And the thing is, rich can mean very different things to different people. I want financial freedom, which means my hard work, sacrifice, persistence and discipline have to be razor sharp and focused on the acquisition of equity and debt. My wife's definition of rich is health and fulfilment, which means that her hard work, sacrifice, persistence and discipline have to be razor sharp and focused on eating right, working out, bettering herself and the world around her. Both are perfectly valid definitions and both are only two of an infinite number of definitions for what it means to be rich. Once you have your definition, channel all of your being into hard work, sacrifice, persistence and discipline and set to work in achieving your goals. It won't be easy, there will be obstacles, failures, ups and downs; you will lose people who you love to jealousy, gain enemies and new friends alike, and redefine what it means to be you. It is a long journey, but in the immortal words of Laozi: \u5343\u91cc\u4e4b\u884c\uff0c\u59cb\u65bc\u8db3\u4e0b A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. ",

The price of one tender coconut here in Goa is around Rs 30/- and rises up to Rs 40 /- during summer. The investment is also minimum. You can set up your makeshift stall on a beach or along the highway. During summer season C.P.= Rs 20 per coconut S.P.= Rs 40 per coconut Suppose you purchase the coconuts for Rs 20/- You sell around 200 coconuts per day . Profit made per day = 20x200= Rs 4000/- Profit per month = 4000x30= Rs 1,20,000/- During rest of the year. C.P.= Rs 15 per coconut S.P.= Rs 30 per coconut Suppose you purchase the coconuts for Rs 15/- You sell around 100 coconuts per day. Profit made per day = 15x100= Rs 1500/- Profit per month = 1500x30= Rs 45000/- Now , summer season in India last for around 3 months. Your Annual income would be (1,20,000 x 3) + (45,000 x 9) = Rs 7,65,000/- (excluding GST) You can also hire a person to sell coconuts for you. All you have to do is pay his wage and a small initial investment. Our maths tution sir used to say this to the students who had no interest in studies. This was his favorite business advise and plumbing being the 2nd favorite. XD Edit 1: Multiple stalls can be set up at various locations in increase the profit manifold. asp ",

Around the half way point you\u2019ll know if you want to be rich or not. He is very clear on what to expect. Decide what \u2018rich\u2019 means, and decide if you will be able to make the ridiculous levels of sacrifice to get there. Work harder than anyone you know. Cultivate a very thick skin because people will be horrible to you on the way up. When you find real friends, do whatever you can to hold on to them. Never lend money to anyone, ever. Decide now to be healthy and strong and love that way. You will need your health. Remember that getting rich is entirely dependent on you making huge sacrifices. Always, always be goal orientated. And remember that you only have a limited amount of time. Practicalities: develop skills the world will need in the future. Watch trends and identify real opportunities. See how you can help people and then scale it up. Focus on finding a product that can sell, not a service. Only think about money until you get to the stage where you don\u2019t have to. Don\u2019t listen to anyone\u2019s advice unless they have actually achieved what you want to achieve. Finally, don\u2019t ever let emotions rule your decisions. If you do, you will fail. ",

            "answer_text": "has always been.Today\u2019s 20-somethings and even those in their early 30s came of age in what may have been the worst national real estate market on record since their grandparents were born. Now a major real estate ad company wants to persuade them that it\u2019s high time to take a risk; that it\u2019s time to walk away from paying high rents in some costly markets and pay high prices to buy their own homes.There\u2019s nothing wrong with the mathematics at the heart of the analysis by Trulia: the raw data show that it\u2019s 23% cheaper for a millennial aged 25 to 34 to buy their own home than to rent, based on the fact that they might only be able to afford a 10% down payment and are likely to move every five years or so.The fact that interest rates are near historic lows, while rents are at astronomic levels in many urban areas, also tilts the balance in favor of buying by any objective standard. Trulia argues that the 30-year fixed mortgage rate would have to hit at least 5% to make renting cheaper than buying in Los Angeles, and top 5.1% in New York City (assuming a 10% down payment). While mortgage rates are on the rise, in anticipation that Federal Reserve policymakers will finally begin boosting key central bank interest rates next month, the rate charged on a 30-year mortgage still averages only 3.98%.Trulia is even urging millennials to push the envelope. Buy a house, they suggest, and nosh on ramen noodles to make mortgage payments for a year or so, because after a raise or promotion or two, that new apartment or house in Boston or Seattle will look like a bargain and be a much easier financial burden.But for many Americans, the tradeoff isn\u2019t that easy. And to be blunt, it shouldn\u2019t be. The ideal of home ownership is wonderful \u2013 and there are many advantages, not least of them the fact that your mortgage interest payments are tax deductible and your monthly payments help you acquire an asset, rather than assisting your landlord in building his or her wealth. For most Americans, it will end up being the single biggest financial asset.But if you don\u2019t plan carefully, your dream of home ownership can end up as a financial nightmare. Here are the points to ponder.Trulia is arguing that millennials should stretch themselves financially, basing that argument on a hypothesis that may \u2013 or may not \u2013 be valid: that they can expect their incomes to rise and their personal financial outlook to improve. You\u2019ll need to be ruthlessly honest with yourself: is that likely to be the case with you?More than any other single factor, what anyone wrestling with the buy v rent decision needs to ponder is the extent to which they are stable. That means how stable their job is (and how likely they are to get promotions and raises over the coming years), how stable their relationship or marriage is (is there a risk that they might have to sell the house at a bad time in the market because of a divorce or split?), and how stable their career path is (might they move cities or states to work for a different company or attend graduate school?). If the answers to any of those questions signals doubt \u2013 that they might not be committed to staying in that house for the next five or more years \u2013 then regardless of what the mathematics says, buying probably isn\u2019t a good idea.That\u2019s because while a house purchase can make sense \u2013 even tenuously \u2013 when you run the math, it may still not be wise when you examine life circumstances. I learned this lesson firsthand when the house I bought just before my 28th birthday sat unsold for a full year after my employer relocated me to New York to work several years later. I knew when I bought it that I wasn\u2019t committed to staying in Toronto for the rest of my life, but had blithely assumed that I\u2019d always be able to sell it. What I hadn\u2019t counted on was that the timing of my move would coincide with a period in which interest rates doubled; that wiped out every penny of equity and all of my savings \u2013 an expensive lesson to learn. A great many homeowners found themselves in precisely the same predicament during the housing crisis: needing to sell because they were relocating, because they were elderly or because they were military families asked to deploy overseas, but unable to find buyers because of the market conditions. So, evaluate your http://circumstances.Be equally honest about your finances. Of course, in some markets where both rents and housing prices are high, the market may impose this discipline on you, making it impossible to save enough for a down payment. (Even Trulia acknowledges that renters and buyers alike are doomed in ultra-tight markets like San Francisco.) But if you\u2019ve got a pristine credit rating and can scrape together a 10% down payment, even banks that have become more disciplined about lending may give you the rope with which to hang yourself in the form of a mortgage.But the costs of home ownership don\u2019t stop with the mortgage. Remember, you\u2019ll also need money to pay property taxes, and the bank that gives you your mortgage will want proof that you\u2019ve got an insurance policy on your new home. When you were renting, there\u2019s a chance that your landlord covered some of your utility expenses: almost certainly he paid a water bill, and possibly either heating or power. Now, all that will be your responsibility. You spot an ominous drip in a ceiling? That\u2019s now your responsibility to fix \u2013 quickly, before it becomes a flood. That parade of ants through your kitchen in spring? That\u2019s up to you to control, along with the signs of mice nibbling on the edges of your cereal box in the kitchen cupboard. The refrigerator that you bought along with the house dies, and that\u2019s another expenditure ... and then there\u2019s the time that you invest in mowing the lawn, painting the walls, and so on.You\u2019ll also have to keep putting money into your retirement savings plan, because your house can\u2019t end up being 100% of your nest egg.This might not even be the right time to buy, anyway. Sure, rental prices are high, but chasing housing prices higher is rarely a wise plan. You may feel that houses are becoming less and less available, and less and less affordable, and you\u2019d be right on both counts. Home prices have risen at 13 times the rate of the typical American\u2019s earnings in recent years, which is in part due to the fact that the number of homes available for sale has been running well below the number that realtors say is required for the market to be in balance. Still, it\u2019s rarely a good idea to get involved in a bidding war simply to ensure you\u2019re buying instead of renting.Millennials \u2013 and others \u2013 who are mulling the renting v buying tradeoff should also ponder some of the long-term market dynamics that will affect the housing market now. If they buy today, with a minimal down payment, they won\u2019t have much of a cushion to protect their primary asset from any erosion in value in the future. And there are at least a few reasons I can think of why such a selloff might occur.First of all, there\u2019s the market itself. We just don\u2019t know what the reaction will be to a rise in interest rates and mortgage rates. Nor do we fully understand how many properties are left over from the financial crisis and the related real estate debacle, that have been repossessed by banks or whose owners still inhabit them but remain in default on their mortgages. Many more of these homes could make their way onto the market in the coming months and years. That probably won\u2019t happen in the most costly urban markets that were least affected by the crash, such as San Francisco or New York, but if you\u2019re looking to buy in, say, Las Vegas, it\u2019s something to bear in mind.Then there are the baby boomers, whose retirement savings fall far, far short of being able to generate an adequate income for their golden years, and whose homes are by far their largest asset. For many, who are approaching retirement in the next five to 10 years, that will mean selling their home \u2013 and flooding the market with another wave of properties for sale.And while it\u2019s true that low interest rates are tempting to home buyers, if you\u2019re using those low rates in order to make a costly purchase, that\u2019s problematic. A potentially more alluring scenario might be to continue living, when possible, in a small and inexpensive studio and sock away at least some money in a savings account, and then emerge a few years down the road, able to make a much larger down payment when rivals can\u2019t afford to borrow much at all in a higher rate environment. If you\u2019re borrowing less, your monthly payment might still be the same, but with a big downpayment you\u2019d be a bank\u2019s preferred customer and a seller\u2019s preferred buyer in a competitive bidding situation. Then, too, you\u2019d find that your house appreciates in value as interest rates decline and you\u2019d be able to cut your financing costs as well.We\u2019ve seen what happens when Americans quaff the real estate Kool-Aid. I\u2019m not sure that we can handle a repeat.This article was amended on 15 November to correctly identify the nature of Trulia\u2019s business. It is an online real estate ad company, not a realtor ",

            "answer_text": "Without showing private sector as an option Govt should take responsibility for the livelihood and income of its citizens and provide permanent oppurtunities even for illiterates. Now where does the govt get funds from for that lets understand debt and budget of economy. Debt -is it private or govt.  When you can print then ideally govt shouldn't have any debt it gets cleared yearly.  Regarding private companies taking loans and debt then if it is external private debt and there is bilateral issue between nations then the govt pays the external private debt and recovers locally from the company   The formula is very simple in this way you get into no or zero debt. It is as follows  On a yearly basis findout previous years debt and current years requirement of funds or fiscal deficit and the total should be minused from the revenue earned and the remaining balance of requirement of funds should be printed .  Now here there is a trick you can borrow a lot of funds but that is not advisable because you would get into debt trap so instead what happens to the deposits in banks and private lenders interested in lending,the govt provides reasonable interests to these funds as expenditure to it but does not use the funds because it has to payback.  As mentioned by the above formula without getting into debt trap you have print currency as per the requirement.  Now some of them say this may lead to inflation.which is wrong .Inflation is the increase in the price of a goods or services on a year on year basis.This can be controlled.The govt has to provide subsidy or inflationary allowance to businesses on a year on year basis to stabilise prices and this increases the value of currency in terms of purchasing power .  Now there is a private companies gimmick if more cash is circulating in the market then the lending rates would go down but the govt ensures reasonable interest rates to the private lenders and people can borrow at a lesser rate from the govt.  So as per the above formula printing of currency has nothing to do with inflation or prices or quantity of goods and services produced.  In common world scenario whether it is private business or personal finance multiplying wealth is thought as a very intelligent or clever thing and it is a challenging task.This individualistic perception comparing or equating to government is wrong.  Remember my friend dont get into business mindset it is tricky and deceiting because it always looks for profits which is not wrong but remember Government is not a business, it is responsible for the careers and lifes of the people so it owns and has money and need not worry about profit /loss because its an expenditure to the public which is genuine and legitimate  So ideally at the start of the year the country has no debt\u2026if there is it could be private debt otherwise number game played by politicians to coverup under development blaming the debt and remember if we clear the debt early then you dont have to pay interest hence cause of worry for private lenders.

The main reason behind why rich get richer is through Investment and controlling cash flow. You have to find multiple ways to invest your money. Banker won't ask you whether your a A student or a B student. If your a professional investor, they ask only your financial statements and you must consider that as your report card not the academic one. Many of them were wrong about the definition of assets and liabilities.The definition of assets is anything put money into your pocket whether you want it or not. And how many here say house is an asset? If yes, your wrong. House is not an asset unless you give it for rental. For example, i have a house and for every month i pay for the expenses, here what is happening money goes out of my pocket . Another example, If you buy BMW don't call it as an asset untill you give it for taxi. Let us put in this way you quit your job, so anything add money to your pocket is called assets and anything takes away money from your pocket is called liabilities. Now take a moment and think about your cash flow system, identify in what all ways money goes out of your pocket, be a halsman in that particular direction. You need to construct the cash flow system in such a way that it should add more money to your pocket than taking it away. The most effective difference between the three kinds of people in the world follows, 1 . The poor spend thier money . 2. The middle burry thier money . 3. The rich invest their money.

I read answer of Akshay Tiwari on how to become rich and make 12 lakhs appx by selling tea, I watched the news Modi ji saying selling pakodas is also employment. Finally came to conclusion that the combination can make you a billionaire in few years. 1 plate of pakoda needs 50 gms besan-Rs 3/- Oil, fuel and other charges per plate (max)-Rs 3/- Per plate Selling Price-25/- Profit per plate-Rs 19/- Estimated number of plates sold per day-100 nos Profit per day-Rs 1900/- Profit per annum (pakodas)-Rs 6,93,500/- Profit per annum (tea)- Rs 12,00,000/- Total income- Rs 18,93,500/- i.e. more than six times the salary a fresher gets on joining his first job and the package usually offered to the pass outs of IITs, IIMs, BITS etc. Perks- NO INCOME TAX, NO GST, NO KRISHI CESS, etc plus festival bonus in form of more customers on those occasions plus NO OFFICE SPACE, NO MARKETING in short NO INVESTMENT PERIOD and NO MONTHLY EXPENDITURE. Finally the unemployed got the answer in the form of a thenga and ghanta.  BANNER: Manmohan-ECO-NOMIST, Modi-PAKODA-NOMIST It\u2019s perfectly fine, no job or business is small as long as done with honesty and hard work but is this what expected from Prime Minister of India countering his failure in creating employment for millions who spent years in obtaining graduation degree, hours of hard work everyday and lakhs in paying fees? India wants to know :p  Edit1: I see the Modi\u2019s \u201cblind\u201d supporters lashing in comments. It\u2019s welcome, but before you comment, you better look into past, the time when BJP was campaigning for its prime ministerial candidate, Modiji. These are the screenshots of a four year old news article, it would definitely awestruck you.   ",

            "answer_text": "Okay, cranking my fingers up for a long reply!! How many people you have seen as \u201crich\u201d around you? If you have seen and analyzed are these guys different then you? Nope, then why are these guys are rich while you are not? Any answer? The answer that many people come up is either he is A self made manRich inheritanceNow those with rich inheritance maybe NOT reading this answer, hence how to become rich? Hard work?Smart work?Intelligence?Persistence?Morality .. ??? etcNope all these are myths!! It is simple, hard work is essential for anything to happen, but not necessary to get rich, if hard work was the key or a part of combination of getting rich, construction workers would certainly had gained something for their hardwork? But how many construction workers you have seen \u201crich\u201d? Smart work? Each SOB (son of bitch) in this answer has mentioned something about \u201cmake your investment work for you and you will be rich\u201d but can these SOBs suggest a investment venture where it is guaranteed to provide some return, in financial markets 80 people loose and 20 gain. If these SOB tells the ventures, there are billions of dollars waiting to be invested in Japan at very low interest, but the truth is investing is not such a profitable and accessible business at all. Intelligence, you must be knowing AK47/56 etcs but did you know the inventor of this gun was poor till his death? How many \u201cinventors\u201d of apple UI interface functionalities are rich now? Persistence? See nokia case, they were so perfect, that they failed to innovate themselves, eventually got sold in pennies. Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla are best examples of cases of morality. Faith ?? Hahhaha Then what is path, that I have to follow for becoming rich? The Answer is you can do nothing, people get rich based on LUCK. If you do not get the chance to invest or know, how will you be participating in the activity to get good returns? Even if you become a \u201cYes Man\u201d and invest in all opportunities available to you, you have lost around 95 % of your investment and you have some hope from other remaining 5 %. When there were sites like Facebook before and after, why only Facebook has yielded high evaluations? It is nothing but pure luck. Same with whats app or any other thing. Warren Buffet was a rich guy before his getting \u201crich\u201d, he was son of a congress man, a person with access to financial sector regulators, the stock exchange people already, but seldom that is mentioned anywhere. I have seen many examples in my life, where there were many people worthy of much better success but some unworthy person, only because of his luck and his being there itself had awarded him with opportunities. When too many of such incidences happened, my rationale mind comes with only one answer, that is people with luck or who have this in their destiny, get those things, no amount of \u201chard/smart work or persistence\u201d can achieve this. You can\u2019t say \u201cI make my own destiny\u201d as destiny has some \u201cgifts\u201d for you, it can be bad or it can good, you can\u2019t escape that and remain pondering over why all unfairness in life happening!!

Not only because it will be something you know a lot about, but that energy will pull you through when things get tough.Take risks. But ONLY with things you know a lot about. Anything else is called taking chances.Make a life plan. Translate your dreams into targets. Then be honest about where you are today and what it will take to achieve your goals. Get clear on the tasks which will move you towards your target. If this involves sacrifice, hard work, retraining, facing your fears, so be it. Then focus ONLY on this roadmap. Don\u2019t waste time or energy on distractions. As Steve Jobs said, focus is not about saying yes, its about saying no.Understand the compound effect. In England we have a saying, \u2018look after the pennies and the pounds will look after themselves\u2019. Be very clear that small things count enormously over time. Darren Hardy showed that the real cost of a $4 a day coffee adds up to $51,833 over only 20 years. The good news however, is that this effect also works for the small improvements you add to your daily rituals too.Understand the difference between debt and leverage. Debt is borrowing without a plan. Leverage is borrowing against a plan.Believe in yourself. Learn to keep your own counsel. If you need help or advice ask for it, but ask people who are positioned to give it, not people who don\u2019t understand.Don\u2019t give up. The difference between winners and the rest is not just talent, it\u2019s about hard work, focus, determination and resilience.Get up and work hard on your mission every day. It adds up. It adds up exponentially in terms of output, experience, contacts and results. Just do it. Keep doing it. Leap and the net will appear.Know your subject. Yes, getting rich IS about LUCK. Luck stands for Labour, Under Correct Knowledge. This means work and effort which is made effective by expertise.Be generous. Give. Give of your time, your respect and your effort, to people who deserve it. This stops scarcity mentality and it signals to the universe that you are not keeping score. In any case, we teach best that which we most need to learn.Don\u2019t get daunted by your dreams. Anything is possible if you break it down into small, sequential tasks. If I ever get a bit phased by any of my own intentions, I bring to mind Michel Lotito, the Frenchman who ate a Cessna 150 aircraft. (I learnt to fly in one of those and consider it no loss). How did he do it? It took two years. One tiny piece at a time.",

But I will say this, both me, and my wife are veteran entrepreneurs, and currently working on 3 separate businesses; 2 of which are in rapid growth phases, 1 still nurturing. Here are some things to consider on the path to \u201crich\u201d. Forget about the word rich. Professional athletes, lotto winners, trust fund babies are \u201crich\". Focus on generating passive \u201cwealth\". Example, a plumber, who can hire multiple other plumbers and apprentices, who then has free time to do other ventures, and develops a multi-million dollar real estate portfolio\u2026is wealthy. I use that example because I just meet one the other day.Prepare to work for free. The adage\u2026\u201dpay yourself first.\u201d Doesnt mean depositing money into \u201cyour\" bank account. But into what is growing your business. My wife, her partner, and me haven't collected a single penny in personal pay from our businesses for 6 months. But we now have expanded into a space that is exceeding all expectations, and is poised to make us \u201cwealthy\". We paid \u201courselves\u201d first\u2026aka, first rate accountant, retained top employees, best equipment etc etc.Prepare to lose friends. The road to wealthy is lonely, accept it, embrace it, move on. I'm not saying you'll become an asshole. But when you haven't collected a single paycheck in 6 months, you just cut a check to your accountant for his retainer, fired an employee who is also a friend etc etc\u2026and because of that the utility company is threatening to shut off the power to your home\u2026then your friend complains about you being late for a dinner\u2026yeah\u2026a disconnect between priorities.Find your B.H.A.G, and jump into it. It stands for B. Big, H. Hairy, A. Audacious, G.Goal. When you've seemingly found the business or idea for wealthy, make a goal that keeps you up at night. For it's shear audacity. If you're not think \u201cwhat the #$%& am I thinking\u201d, it's not big enough. Never underestimate fear and desire as a renewable power source to drive you during the rough times.Enjoy the f###ing journey. Regardless of your success, your embarking on a journey that few take. Fewer will succeed, but if you enjoy it, it'll be a more enriching experience.Good journey to you! Sorry\u2026one more, Find a mentor, use them, heed their advice, respect their advice. ",

He was failed in Engineering.But he wasn't at all interested in this.He was only interested in Making film but his Anu aunty & his mom were always against his activity. Now they realized that they were wrong. He chased his passion made movies with stars,published book,worked with great composers like A.R.Rahman,made his merchandise.     His books post was found by himself in a Auto & he mentioned that the ad was most probably distributed by Any aunty herself. So from a jobless to the co-founder of a million dollar company >> The result of work,dream & passion. In his interview , He told that once his another friend who was in IIT met with his old classmate at IIT in the Garage when he came to India for a business meeting.His old friend was the garage owner. He was shocked to see why didn't his old friend join in a company as a CEO. Inspite of doing IIT & being a bright student why he had chosen guarage was the question that was stucked on his mind(Working in a big Consultancy company) He told that he was working in a giant MNC outside India (Apple) When he returned to India he made a company to increase fuel efficiency,sold it & made a garage. He loved to repair cars so he was doing that only & he's happy & satisfied in his job. So my dear friends, Be rich in efficiency,be happy always.

And now if you love Engineering study hard for JEE MAINS and score above 200+ and get a graduate Degree from NIT or IIT And soon after getting your degree,establish a Tuition point exclusively for JEE Mains coaching  Take up a small room with second hand desks and one board it hardly costs 5000 rs in total And now publicize your tuition point through pamphlets,facebook and linkedin. And then try to have 50 students atleast for one year and collect 1000 per month for each student. 50*1000= 50,000 per month with just 3 hrs of your time Teach Maths for 1 hr,Physics for 1 hr and chemistry for 1 hr,for 3 hrs daily you get 50k per month Initially try to manage yourself but soon after few months with the profit you get have separate lecturers. See parents in our country are so obsessed with the tag of this NIT or IIT.Once they see you with this tag automatically students come to your doorsteps. But don\u2019t see this as business side always!! as an educated person educate people and at the same time earn too at the same time. Keep up the nameof your institute.Out of 50 students have atleast 3\u20134 students top ranks so that you can increase your student strength every year. Believe it or not Few coaching centers take around 6k per student saying JEE Mains crash course in 2 months\u2014 Which mean if you have 100 students 100*6000\u20136 lakhs dude its time to have our Business !! Use up the business logics to increase your business like Logic 1: Say to already admitted students that \u201cIf you bring 2 students to our institute there will be discount in your fee\u201d Logic 2: Appoint one marketing executive for Boosting about institute time to time. You don\u2019t to appoint him for full time let him boost yours on saturday and sundays that will be fine. Believe it or not Few coaching centers take around 6k per student saying JEE Mains crash course in 2 months\u2014 Which mean if you have 100 students 100*6000\u20136 lakhs dude its time to have our Business !!

In and of itself money is only worth as much as what we can do with it. Given that, why do you want to get rich? Is it to look good in front of others? Is it to feel secure about your future? Is it because it represents your self worth? Without knowing the motivation behind why you want more money, that you\u2019ll be under money\u2019s control rather than the other way around.How big is your bucket?. Richness is relative. Where $10k USD is a pittance for Bill Gates, it\u2019s a fortune for those who live in poverty. Know what your number is. Do you want $100k? $1m? $10m? Starting with our \u201cwhy\u201d gives us motivation to work towards a target, but we must define a target to know whether we\u2019ve \u201cfilled the bucket\u201d.How much do you have in your bucket?. With a target in mind, it\u2019s time to understand where you currently are. How much money do you have in the bank? What do you owe? What will you need to spend on? Only by knowing how big our bucket is and how much of it is already filled can know we what we\u2019re missing.Plug the leaky bucket. We already know that the bucket is getting filled every month, but how is it leaving? Given our needs, we\u2019ll always have \u201choles\u201d in our bucket for food, rent, transportation etc. but could you reduce the size of those holes by eating cheaper or even eliminate some holes like by giving up cigarettes? Just like how we wouldn\u2019t drink water from a leaky cup and expect to quench our thirst, we can\u2019t live a \u201cleaky\u201d life and expect to become rich.Actively fill the bucket. Plugged up the extra holes in your bucket? Now it\u2019s time to figure out how you can fill it up faster. Could you\u2026get a raise? Start a side-hustle? The key here is understanding the way for you to get your bucket filled faster is delivering more value to others and ensuring they recognize that.Passively fill the bucket. As good as it is for you to fill your own bucket, it\u2019s important to recognize that you only have 24 hours in a day and to fill up your bucket faster you\u2019ll need help which means you\u2019ll be outsourcing your bucket filling. You can do this either by owning a company where employees deliver value to customers and your bucket gets filled as a result of profit or by owning stocks and bonds that deliver additional cash to your bucket. Either way the key here is that you\u2019re not trading time for money and that this can be scalable in the long run.Separate your buckets. As you fill up your bucket there\u2019ll be so many opportunities to create new holes in your bucket whether it\u2019s to have a better lifestyle, buy something fancy or simply because you think you deserve it. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll eventually need bucket with no holes that will sit there and continue to collect cash for you. Keep this separate to your daily spending bucket and watch as over time your bucket overflows!",

Here is the business plan Title: STREET FOOD : PANI PURI Location (assumptions) \u2014 Near girl's college Business: Street cart selling of Pani puri / Bhel puri (run by women)  Here is a SWOT analysis STRENGTHS The food-cart will be operated by two women employees. Very rare to see women selling panipuris.The panipuri will be made fresh will spread the aroma. Eyes and smell are the triggers for purchasing food items.Hygienic, fresh, visually appealing, aromatic and transparent food making.Fresh RO purified water will be used.Attractive hoarding which clearly outlines not only the appetizing property of panipuri but also the low calories, digestive properties etc.Attractive lighting and mild music.Paper napkins,\u2026Business hours: 5 hours : 2pm to 8pm * tentative*  WEAKNESS \u00b7 Poor location choice \u00b7 Rainy seasonOPPORTUNITIES\u2026 Location near the girl's college\u2026After college, many students will feel hungryGirls do not come alone and eat street food. They always come in pairs.Girls in their developmental age, crave for lip smacking,spicy- tangy-sweet food stuff.Ovulating girls might develop deeper sense of smell & taste and may prefer panipuri.Panipuri is the only food substance that can stimulate all the zones of taste-buds in a person (with the exception of being bitter).Observation indicates that many girls order two plates of panipuri.THREATS Outbreak of viral fever or contagious diseases (government will close all road side shops)\u2022 Lack of availability of Mint & Coriander leaves during summer / Government holidays\u2022 Bandhs / Hartals\u2022 VIP travel & Police problems\u2022 Traffic congestion and problems\u2022 Government license needs to be obtained to sell street food - cost not calculated. Data not available\u2022 The police & local politician have to be paid amounts ranging from Rs.100 to Rs.200 per day based on the location.Cost calculation (REPRESENTATIVE ONLY) \u00b7 Per plate: Rs.20\u00b7 Total working days: 26 (Sundays holiday)Income: Expected number of customers (plate count) per hour: 100 to 300 (Two resources serving pani-puris. The owner can also pitch in if there is crowd or festival days) Min Income per evening:100 Plates sold \u00d7 Rs.20/plate \u00d7 5hours=10000 /dayMax Income per evening:300 Plates sold \u00d7 Rs.20/plate \u00d7 5hours=30000 /day Min Income per month: 26 days \u00d7 10000 = 260,000 Max Income per month: 26 days \u00d7 30000 = 780,000 Expenses:Cost of manpower: Rs.400 per day( total 5 hours) = Rs.800/- = 20,800 per month.Manufacturing cost: 5Rs / plate =500 ~ 1500 per day = 13,000~39,000 per month.Cart maintenance = 500 per month.

Now, you have enough money to start another panipuri stall near school or college to increase the sales, Make the chain and start 2\u00d7 stall per years. after 3 years you have 2\u00d72\u00d72 = 8 stall \u00d7 2,400,00 Minimum* per year The math is left for you to calculate how much you will get per years. Are you ready to buy a counting machine and willing to be my partner :) ??? No kidding. Note: The inspiration for this idea is real and not just fancy thinking.  ",

            "answer_text": "How Do people get Wealthy? Interesting Question and a lot of answers explain it well but let me give you a background to understand it better. 7 Powerful ways to get wealthy: Increase your assets: Increase your number of assets, an asset is anything that give you money actively or passively, like a real estate, property or stocks. Look in all of these the values of assets is most probably increasing with time.Keep in mind that people who are just relaying on a single job never get wealthy.Decrease your liabilities: Liabilities are those things that are eating money from your pocket, like your car or any other cost other then necessarily. According to the book Rich dad, Poor dad, spend your money in liability but only that comes from your created assets.Invest: Don\u2019t play on a safe zone try to play a hardcore game and you will learn and grow too.Buy When things are cheap: This is what most of the people don\u2019t care about, invest your money in those things that you think will be expensive in future. The best example is the Bitcoin era, if you invest $100 in 2014 it will yield a lot of money in today market.Invest in Multiple Businesses: The more you invest the more you have passive income sources, as one Warren buffet Said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t know how to make money while you are sleeping you will work forever\u201dSee Future: One one has the ability to see future but we at least predict it through our instinct knowledge, if you can\u2019t do that you can\u2019t win this game. Simple. Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs And Elon Musk do that years ago what you are doing now.Think Different: You can\u2019t make money or accommodate money using the old shity methods, you have to think different and to make something out new to accommodate wealth.

We always hear things about people becoming rich overnight, and if they can do it, then you can do it too. The key is not believe in yourself or be persistent (it\u2019s definitely helpful but not the key) The key is to seek for opportunity. When the tablets first went popular, everybody thought it should cost hundreds of dollars. however, in some Asian factories, the price of an android tablet can be as low as $30, many people bought them and resold on eBay and took more than 10 or even 20 times of profit. You see, most people didn\u2019t see the opportunity, because once they saw the price, they believed in it. If they have asked themselves, \u201cDoes it actually worth that much?\u201d or \u201cwhere can I get it cheaper?\u201d they\u2019ve probably found a new opportunity. Sometimes a question is all it takes to find a opportunity. It\u2019s not impossible, not even difficult, but you have to keep an open mind. The path of becoming rich is the process of find more and more opportunities. Working hard can't make you rich, because it is something that everybody could do. Finding opportunities can make you rich, because most people doesn't even bother to look for them. ",

            "answer_text": "I answered this from another question, What are some of the legit ways of getting very rich before I turn 30?, but I'll try to sum it up. I'm assuming that by \"What is the good way...\" you mean \"What is the best chance I have...\" I'm taking the stance that you're being altruistic and want to do this legally. First and foremost, it's to get rid of any bad debt you may have. Debt such as a mortgage, particularly on investment property that produces income, don't really count. 1. Have confidence. By this, I mean that you need to imagine yourself as already having achieved what you want. If that means that you need to write it down every single day, do it. If it means you just need to say it in the mirror a few times a day, do it. You'll find out what works best for you. 2.  You need to plan out your life. Set long-term, medium-term, and short-term goals. Once you have those, break them down into finer and finer components, until it's impossible for you to break them down any further. 3. Save your money. Always save as much of it as you can, and don't EVER touch the savings, no matter what, unless you have a true emergency. Always find ways around touching that money. If it means you skip out on a night with your buddies or have to eat at home when you wanted to eat out, so be it. Every time you get paid, set aside as much of a chunk of that money as you can. 10% is a good rule of thumb, but if you can do 50%, go for it. Watch how quickly it will multiply. 4. What are your interests? Is there something you're better at than anyone else? Do you enjoy it? If the answer is \"no\" to any of these questions, re-evaluate yourself, and dig deep. Even if your answer to the second question keeps coming up as a \"no\", there is probably a unique combination of things you enjoy that you can merge together, and be exceedingly good at them. Now your next step is to figure out if there is a way to monetize those things. If not, you can always repeat this step. These are a few things you can do. If you follow them, you'll be on the right path to having the right mindset for getting rich. It's a slow process, but having goals will speed it up immensely.

            "answer_text": "The secret which I understood after many years. 9 to 5 job never make you rich. It makes you slave, a corporate slave.I bet, we are all doing some sort of work which we are not interested at all, but we are doing just for the sake of money. I mean the salary. I will tell you why we are not rich. At the end of our final year graduation, we thought of getting a job! Have we ever thought of giving the job? No right? We are confined to our limits and ability. We can do anything and everything but our mind never support it, because we trained our mind like that. Well, everyone prefers financial freedom over 9 to 5 job. Look at the rich people today around you, they became rich because they followed their dreams, not money. Take example right from Infosys Narayana Murthy to Cricketer Sachin Tendulkar. They followed their dreams despite having many odds in their life. Follow your dreams, money will follow you. It's easy to say the above lines, but I know the situation of middle-class people. We work to live and we are comfortable in our life.We are not ready to take big steps in life.We are not ready to move out of our comfort zone.So, we are not rich, but we are happy lower-middle-class people.  (Your little appreciation and honest feedback make me write even more. A person who feels appreciated will always do more than expected.) Thanks for reading. Yours, Rakshith Akira \u270d ",

            "answer_text": "The most important first step is to always live below your means. In other words live on 90% of your income or less. That may seem hard but there is someone who makes 90% of what you do and gets along fine. The second step is to invest your savings wisely. Stocks and real estate are the two best ways. Your own business is a third but has more risk. Lots of business owners make less than they could working for someone else. As an example, someone who starts at age 25 and invests $ 100.00 a week into the stock market can expect to retire with 1.2 million dollars. Lots of people tend to spend 105% of what they make. If they get a raise they will quickly find a way to spend it. Something I read on a Facebook post this morning went something like this: Rich people are rich because they live like they are poor.Poor people are poor because they live like they are rich. Warren Buffet still lives in the house he bought 60 years ago for around 60 grand.H. L. Hunt drove a beat up old pickup truck until the wheels fell of it. ",

            "answer_text": "One of the ways to be rich is to stop spending more money going out than coming in. Take at least 10\u201315% of your paycheck and always pay yourself first. Put it into an interest yielding account. I know this sounds like old school because it is time tested. Next start a plan to pay off your credit cards (or any debts). I know this seems like stating the obvious but you have to get to a point first where you pay off your credit cards and smaller debts so that you are not paying high interest rates each month. You start with the highest paying interest ratecard and work your way down till they are paid off. Pay the minimum on the rest but do not spend any money on those cards. The goal here is to establish yourself so you are your own bank. Have a couple thousand dollars saved in terms of emergency funds. Have a separate account that you agree to make deposits you will never ever touch that yields interest. Goal is to have 2\u20133 thousand in emergency funds you can replenish. Then save 10,000 to 20,000 in the other account (minimum). Once you have that targeted amount saved up. you can open up a mutual fund or Roth IRA. Learn the differences. You can start investing in stocks too. Again the goal here is to save no matter what and get your saved money into investments that will in the long term yield a ROI (return on investment). Stsrt investing in real estate, tech, health stocks and some trends whatever you do just make sure you diversify your portfolio (for either short or long term using investment growth strategies ). Obviously work with a professional organization that is reputable who handles stock, investments, etc. Maintain this diversified portfolio and keep you savings pattern. Again the goal here is to keep more money coming in than spending it. In 10, 15, 20 years if you continue this trend diversifying and saving you will be comfortably rich. You can also at any point invest your money in a startup or real estate deals as you accumulate your nest egg. I am not a financial consultant. I just come from a poor family that became rich because we did these things. And my grandfather left a legacy we continue. I also learned from and researched a lot of rich people to learn what their habits are as an adult. And they continue to live well but modestly because they know the value of saving money and having financial freedom in the long run. \u00a0",

Go step by step and you will become rich in few months. For the first day of becoming rich. Spend Rs. 2000 in construction of wooden stand for selling pani puri.Spend Rs. 1000 in ingredients for making tasty pani and delicious puri.Now, on an average a person who sells pani puri places stand for 6 hours/day. On an average, Pani puri wala charges 20 Rs./plate on an average rate of 30 plates/hour.As he operates for average 6 hours, his one day income is 20*30*6=3600 Rs.His material cost including chutney,masala etc per day is 1000 Rs.One day profit is 3600\u20131000=2600 Rs.One month profit is 2600*30= 78,000 Rs.One year profit is 78000*12= 9,36,000 INR.Approx we can take as 10 lakh Rupees without giving any tax.Work for 10 year and net profit is 1 crore INR.

On the other hand an Engineer package varies from 3 lakh to 6 lakh on an average.Students of M.B.B.S have to wait a long time for completing their studies.Note: I don't want to become rich. Edit: I'm not asking anyone to leave their Engineering or Medical plan. It's just a business plan which you can use it by appointing someone to perform. Inputs are less and output is more. You and they, both will be benefitted. I have done calculation on basis of majority. I know many Pani puri wala don't earn this much. Their are many factors related. I have not done calculation by simply assumption but by asking from two people who sell in two different regions. ",

            "answer_text": "What are some ways to start a business? Brands, Businesses, Companies have come a long way since they began as a way to tell one person's cattle from another. Before we discuss the steps of how to find your perfect brand name and start your new business, we first need to understand what a brand is and what are the characteristics of a good brand. What is a brand? A brand is the personality that identifies a product or service. What characteristics does a good brand name have? Memorable and easy to pronounce. No more than 2 or 3 syllables. The name should relate to your business. Avoid using initials or abbreviations. You want your name to communicate to your customers. A good brand hints at it without directly saying it. Brand name should be unique. Many brand names are made of combining two words to make a new word. Brand name should appeal to your target customer 6 Steps to finding the perfect brand name: Finding the perfect name can feel like a huge and daunting task, but if you break down it down into steps in a process it will feel much easier to accomplish. 1) Brainstorm & Lists When I begin to come up with possible company or brand names, I start by brainstorming. For example if my company was a travel company in San Francisco. I would start by writing down all the words that relate to travel and then all the words that relate to San Francisco. Then I would write a third list of all the words I would like associated with the name and what the company should be known for. 2) Thesaurus & Google Image Once I have a list of words, I add to that list by looking online in Thesaurus.com - The world's favorite online thesaurus! - The world's favorite online thesaurus! - The world's favorite online thesaurus! for others similar words. This will double your list and increase your chance of finding more interesting words you may not have thought of. In addition. I will type in some of these words into Google and look under images. I use this to generate more ideas about the name concept. Sometimes an image, will give you an idea or a word you hadn't thought of. 3) Mix & Match Once you have these lists you can start putting words together. It's a bit daunting at first, but keep trying to put words together. Be sure to keep the name short and simple. This step will take a bit of time, as you go back and forth between this step and steps 1 and 2. 4) Web domain name Once I have narrowed the list down to some of my favorites, I usually like to see what my website possibilities will be with the name. This also helps me see what names are already being used. I usually go to Make Your Own Way | GoDaddy to check the availability of the domain name. This will narrow down your list significantly. 5) Favorites list & getting feedback With my short list of my favorite names, I ask for feedback from friends and colleagues to see which names resonate. You can also post it on a forum, like LinkedIn or Facebook or maybe a forum specific to your line of business. Depending on the project, I may prefer to keep it a bit of a secret and keep it among trusted friends and colleagues. 6) Legality Lastly once you have your name or names, you will need to be sure it is legally available. Check with your local county to be sure your business name isn't the same as that of an existing corporation, LLC, or limited partnership in your state. Finding a good brand name takes time and hours of hard work, but having a process to follow will make it easier. Often I find I have to revisit previous steps in the process. However with continued effort you will find the right name and when you do you will not only have a brand that attracts your customers, but a brand name you will be proud of. ",

In order to keep this claim to your stock, sign up and join Robinhood. Open a new account in the next 24 hours | Robinhood Generate two incomes \u2014 or more The richest people focus on earning, and they typically aren't content with one source of revenue. As author Thomas C. Corley found in his multi-year study of self-made millionaires, the rich \"do not rely on one singular source of income,\" he writes in \"Change Your Habits, Change Your Life.\" In fact, \"65% had at least three streams of income that they created prior to making their first million dollars,\" Corley says, such as real-estate rentals, a side hustle or a part-time job. Once you start bringing home two paychecks, try Jay Leno's strategy: Save the bigger of the two checks and live on the other. It not only frees up more cash that you can save and invest, but it helps prevent lifestyle inflation, which is when you increase your spending as your income increases. Save to invest \"Investing money is how you will get super rich,\" says self-made millionaire Grant Cardone. \"The only reason to save money is to one day invest money.\" The only reason to save money is to one day invest money. Grant Cardone SELF-MADE MILLIONAIRE In fact, how much you save and invest is often more important than the size of your paycheck, says personal finance expert Ramit Sethi. \"On average, millionaires invest 20% of their household income each year. Their wealth isn't measured by the amount they make each year, but by how they've saved and invested over time,\" he writes in his book, \"I Will Teach You to Be Rich.\" Ready to put your money to work? Read this investing guide for beginners. Automate your finances Once you've committed to investing your money, the easiest way to stick with it over time is to make good spending/shopping decisions . Set up a regular transfer so that money from your paycheck is sent to your savings or investment accounts every month, before you even see it. Say one of your 2020 goals is to put $2,000 into an emergency fund. Start by figuring out how much you'd have to save per paycheck over the course of the year to reach that goal. Then set up an automatic transfer so you move that amount from your checking account to your savings each time you get paid. If you have even bigger wealth goals, automation can help get you there, too. It helped one millennial, Grant Sabatier, save over half his income and eventually become a millionaire. \"Automation is essential,\" he tells CNBC Make It. \"When I first started saving and investing, I was a little more old school \u2014 I was trying to invest as much as possible into the online savings accounts I had set up, and it was a pretty manual process. Now, one of the biggest recommendations I make is to automate as much of your savings as possible.\" Build relationships with successful people Your community matters. It can even affect your net worth, says self-made millionaire and author Steve Siebold: \"In most cases, your net worth mirrors the level of your closest friends. \u2026 We become like the people we associate with, and that's why winners are attracted to winners.\" We become like the people we associate with, and that's why winners are attracted to winners. Steve Siebold Coreley agrees: \"Wealthy, successful people are very particular about who they associate with,\" he writes. \"Their goal is to develop relationships with other success-minded individuals.\" If you don't have highly motivated people in your network, Corley suggests joining groups for people who share your same career goals or personal interests. Think big If you set your expectations exceptionally high and are up for any challenge, you're on the right track. After all, \"no one would ever strike it rich and live their dreams without huge expectations,\" Siebold writes. And don't put off setting money goals or implementing these lifestyle changes \u2014 if you want to build wealth, jump in today, says Se: \"The single most important factor to getting h is getting started, not being the smartest person in the room.\"Don't miss: The best money advice we heard in 2019, from Mark Cuban, Warren Buffett and other experts ",

            "answer_text": "Investing in Equity, Mutual Funds etc. will get you nowhere. It will take you decades and more to finally to MAYBE save enough money to retire peacefully. So use leverage. If you are familiar with compounding, you\u2019ll understand how important leverage is. In short: Using Leverage can get you 20 years worth of gains in 2 years. Imagine what you could do in 20. Of course that also multiplies the risk. But I could not work for 40 more years in a shitty job for the rest of my life just so one day I might not have to work anymore. I took some extra risks, so improve the quality of my life. When you have enough money coming in passively that pays for all your expenses and more, you can call yourself financially free. What I did was, along with my job, the extra money I was saving, Instead of investing it in stocks or mutual funds or other slow ways,  I used leverage, and put in my money in my side hustle. I had 3 side hustles. #1 Small Businesses like Food and Tea stalls. #2 Flipping Real Estate #3 Swing Trading Back when I was 20, I had Rs 20,000 in savings every month, I used that to build my credit score because I had no credit score. I made 2 credit cards just to build to score, so I can qualify for cheaper mortgage rate. Along with my day job, every minute I could spare, would go into my business. My sleep schedule was a mess, but it was all worth it because I could see the light at the end of the tunnel! I kept at it for 2 years. Meanwhile I was setting up my small stalls across the city that were generating phenomenal returns. Reinvesting that money, letting it compound, expanding, taking extra risks for extra returns! That\u2019s how wealth is made. That is how one can get rich. TLDR: Get a side hustle. Keep reinvesting back into the business. Let it sit and compound. Give it a year and you\u2019ll be better than 99% of the population. I wrote another quora answer on this topic.

Owning a business is the fundamental path to almost all wealth unless you are some type of performer, entertainer or sportsperson.Copy an already successful idea, service or product but figure out a way to improve it. Eg. Facebook was not the first social networking site. Google was not the first search engine.Move to a country where your own currency immediately makes you rich. Eg. If you\u2019re from the US move to Mexico and spend your US dollar retirement benefits there. They will go much further and you will be materially speaking much richer. The same if you\u2019re from the UK and you move to Spain. Your pounds will get you much further in Malaga than London.Save more than you spend.Stop watching TV and start reading.Don\u2019t study successful people study failures.Figure out a cure for cancer.",

            "answer_text": "How to Get Rich: If you\u2019re reading this, the assumption is that you aren't currently and you hope to change that one day. I have good news, although it\u2019s not easy, it is possible. To begin, you have to put making AND SAVING money at the very top of your priorities. I\u2019ll clarify my point: If you aren\u2019t rich, the only way to become rich is to make money and not spend it. Even people who inherited great fortunes (land, homes, businesses) owe it to someone in their family deciding to save some of their money and using it to invest in assets. Here is some very exciting news if you\u2019re young. (When I say young I mean 18\u201325) If you start saving $100/ week in an IRA (only $5,200 per year) RIGHT NOW, I can tell you with near certainty that you will have $1,000,000 or more by the time you\u2019re 60. Google it. Investing in an IRA every week until you\u2019re 60 will push you into the ranks of the millionaires, if you consider millionaire rich congratulations! You\u2019ve made it. If not, read on\u2026 Saving/ investing over the course of your entire life is not attractive to you. Maybe because (a) you want more money or because (b) you want it faster How can you get to $1,000,000 before you\u2019re an old fart? How can you make excess of $1,000,000? I\u2019ll tell you it is no easy task. You can search the internet for answers and you will find HUNDREDS of gurus who say they know. The first thing you\u2019ll want to do is avoid anyone who makes money by teaching others how to make money. This is usually a scheme. The person is usually making more from teaching than for the thing they are teaching you to do. That said\u2014 online coaching/ consulting can be lucrative. In general, however if you want to create big money quickly, you need to create a product or offer a widely-needed service. The products that make the most money for their creators are typically products that solve a problems for others. If you can identify a problem and create the solution for it, you are well on your way to generating massive income. This process is called innovation. Think about products you use everyday and learn how they came about. The beauty of innovation is that once you identify a problem and solve it, you have something that people will pay money for. If you can create a system so that people can continually purchase your product, you can make money while you devote your time to other lucrative projects. This is a perfect Segway to one of the last keys to becoming \u201crich\u201d. The rich have multiple streams of income. The rich make money by buying businesses that are fully operational and profitable. They copy and paste this process over and over. The result is enormous sums of cash flowing into their accounts month after month. After years of repeating this process, they have EXCESS cash and it is with all of this excess cash that the rich buy luxuries that make you want to be them. ",

You will find that there are no level playing fields and it is difficult to keep your integrity when others don't play fair. Don't drop to their level. Your reputation is something that is difficult to build but easy to destroy. I live by principles some may call them rules: Wake up early. This is key. I wake up at 6am, pray and then meditate to review my prior day and plan my new one. I check futures for equity trading, read business and news headlines, quick check of emails and put my daily schedule together prioritizing it using the Eisenhower Matrix. I start with a few simple things to build momentum as described in Law of Momentum. I workout doing weight and cardio it gets the energy level up for the entire day. Afterwards I eat a good breakfast with a protein drink. I get important decisions made while no one is calling and there are no interruptions. When the day begins I am focused and energized. Keep things in perspective people overreact to small problems which wastes energy and disturbs focus. Let the little things go and save the energy for what's important. When working remember that \u201cif it don't make dollars, it don't make sense\u201d Focus, drive, confidence and attitude determine more about how far you will go in life than anything else. We all possess these attributes, work on them. Don't settle, you make concessions once you will do it always, so don't skip workouts, meetings, putting in extra hours act. You may not see the results today, but you will see yourself getting ahead of the competition as time goes on. Extra effort is never wasted. When I say don't settle this does not apply to negotiations, create win/ win situations. You can't retire from one deal anyways and people do business with people that are fair over others that try to get over on them. Everyday is a cumulative effect of your efforts. Every time you save 20% plus of your income and invest it you will be building your financial future. When you work an extra 2 hours at your new part time web business your building your financial future etc etc we are an instant gratification society. It is good to remember that in business but not when building your future. You need to have patience and the results will come. The 3 most common ways millionaires have acquired their wealth are: Real Estate: This is the number one wealth builder. I advise purchasing homes in preforeclosure at 25% discount to market and doing a combination of flips and rentals. Business: Partime web based business adds income to further savings for investments. Service or product based thru craigslist, ebay and Amazon. Equities: Drip program can insure an early and wealthy retirement. ",

Monitor your finances very carefully, identify leaks and maximize is making money. Be willing to work hard, but work at something that can be multiplied such as a product with mass sales potential (especially to a military or government) or a system that can be multiplied (such as a restaurant franchise or multiple location business like a mailbox service or delivery service) or things that very easily expand such as intellectual property (music, games, books, tv / film, apps) and then focus on selling them.

            "answer_text": "See here is the problem. People all want to get rich but this usually means some will win and lose in a zero-sum game. Some people will have more of something than others. Some people will have more customers than others. This may create anti-social behavior as some people may not want to share things with others. The truth is that we are supposed to be as efficient as possible, meaning least cost for greatest value. This means people will be expected to do more for less! This is the irony of trying to get rich (rich meaning inefficient or doing less for greater cost). To get business we have to do more for less but this means becoming poorer, not richer. So we want to be rich but are expected to be poorer to get business. This is the irony of capitalism! It might also be a paradox, where people or workers have to be poorer in order to be profitable. Being profitable is a way to create wealth but unless you have a good product or service to sell then this may not work too well. The formula to use I think is: (price - cost) * quantity sold. As you can see in the formula, if your price is not higher than the cost of the product or service then you won't become wealthier or richer. So it's important to make sure the price is higher than the cost. However, certain factors may cause price to go down (competitors, lack of demand in marketplace) and costs to go up (workers want higher pay, raw materials prices go up), meaning becoming less profitable. Being a monopoly means you can sometimes better control these factors. Basically, you want to try to maximize price and minimize cost while maximizing quantity sold. This is a way to get wealthy, but there are factors that can make this not happen or happen less so (business competitors tend to make price go down by perhaps offering something better for the same price, workers demanding higher wages tends to make costs go up, and less customer demand makes quantity sold go down). To get wealthier you need to increase this value (price-cost) and/or increase quantity sold. And if (price-cost) becomes negative and quantity sold becomes less, then this means becoming less profitable or becoming poorer. When (price-cost) is equal to zero (when price=cost) then you break-even meaning you don\u2019t make a profit or a loss. Ironically, it may be that people are more desired being poorer than wealthy by others, because this may mean they are less powerful and will work for less. Workers are the cost to a business and so this tends to want to get minimized. Price is what is charged to the customer and tends to be higher than cost and maximized but factors can affect the price causing it to go down by competitors or lower customer demand or to go up by minimizing supply to demand. The business owner gets the profits (price-cost)* quantity, while the worker just gets their wage (cost to the business owner). The risk to the business owner is when (price-cost) becomes zero or negative as this means no profits are generated or worse that it will make the business owner poorer. So it\u2019s important to try or hope that price is somehow greater than cost. The best way is perhaps socialism where the wealth is divided evenly or more fairly. I have suggested an equal pay for every worker regardless of job (so doctors would make the same as nurses or janitors or teachers), but profits would be shared unequally based on production so this would reward those who did more or a better job than others, encouraging productivity and higher quality. An equal pay would also make it easier to determine who was better for a position since pay is equal (or a variable that is held constant), and people would pick a job based on ability and preference rather than its pay. A Universal Basic Income (funded by a sales tax rather than an income tax) would also be good as this would help people who were elderly, unemployed, or disabled. ",

            "answer_text": "It is simpler than you think. Lets reverse engineer the above question. Being rich(financially) means having a lot of money. Where does that money come from? People pay you. Why would people pay you? Because you give them something that they want. The more value you bring to them the more they will pay you. Its that simple. People also pay you if you can solve their most important and critical problem. The more complex the problem the more they will pay you. We pay a doctor because we cant fix ourselves, reason why a doctor gets paid more because they have a good demand while the supply is really low. So how do you become rich? Become an expert in one of the most in-demand skill and be valuable to your employers or customers. How do you become an expert? Read a ton of books related to your domain. Its quite interesting that we used to wake up early in the morning to study for our exams but as soon as we get employed most of us stop learning. When you read books across multiple domains it has a multiplying effect and leads to a combination of ideas. Here is an example how it works: Lets say you are an Android developer and you read books on finance as well. That will give you an idea to make a finance based Android application. I was an average student when in college, but due to a continuous effort at learning new things I am now in a position where I earn 10X as compared to my class toppers. I still invest a good amount of time & money in reading & upgrading my skills and the return on investment is at least a 1000X for me.

            "answer_text": "Well, as much i know There are no \u2018 Secrets\u2019 to get rich overnight. But there are proven systems to get rich. If you are serious about getting rich, you need to to get your mind focused on income. Increase your income enough and you will be able to save something substantial. Of course you should spend less than you earn, but if you make $50,000 a year with a couple of kids, what money is there left over to save?? Here are some tips you can use that will actually get you to millionaire status :- \u25cf Invest in yourself :- Successful people invest time, energy and money in improving themselves. First help yourself out so you are in a position to help someone else out. This means investing in yourself to become great at something. Investing in yourself is the best investment you can make. \u25cfGo get great at what you do :- Commit yourself that you will be great, not just average. Any industry or company can be a painful profession for average and bottom performer\u2019s but it will be easy and rewarding for those that are great. I know that people those that live, breathe and eat their profession, those that are obsessed, become great not the other one and no one can stop them to achieve their goal. The fact is, if you aren\u2019t great, you are average. Then dude the rich will get great. \u25cf Find a job in the right vehicle :- The rich people will get in the company where there is opportunity for growth. To many people just look for a job. Yes, you need a job but you need the right vehicle. All companies live from this things called Revenue. Get commissions rather than just a salary earner than you will finally be in control of how much you earn. \u25cf Hit $100k, then invest the rest :- First, try to save $100,000. You probably be thinking that why??? You need to prove to yourself that you can go out and get money. If you only have $10,000 saved, your only priority should be increasing your income so that you can save more. Once you can earn and save, then you can start building wealth. I never looked to get rich quickly, but yeah i did look to get rich. \u201c Saving $100,000 shows that you have an ability to make money and keep it. Most people can\u2019t do either\u201d. So go get rich and yes invest in yourself first\u2026!! Peace\u270c :)Happy reading THANK YOU\u2026!! ",

            "answer_text": "There are a thousand ways to get rich and they differ in every country and trade. But what is common between all the paths to obtaining riches is, creating a plan. You wont become rich by accident, unless your extremely lucky. It involves smart decisions and understanding how money works. Whatever you industry or location, start by looking around you for examples of people that have achieved what you want to do. If you cant find any, you will have to move to another area, city or even another country like I did. You can always return home, when you have reached your goals, but you may never reach your goals where you are today. Don't be intimidated by moving. Once you have found examples of how it is done, spend time to study exactly the steps involved, understand the risks, the difficulties, the time involved. You need to be actively working in that exact industry. Then you can start to craft your strategy to achieve the same goal. Here are the exact steps I took. Joe McCracken's answer to What is the most effective yet efficient way to get rich? It took many years, but it worked and I have seen others, similar to me do the same. Start with a plan that covers all outcomes, you will then know what to do when something unexpected happens. Without a plan, time will just drift away and other events will distract you. Before you know it, it will be too late in your life to start. Make a positive decision and do something about it today. ",

The only difference is, I don't want to be rich if it means living a lousy life like some stock broker or banker who eats junk every day. Sure - I would like to be rich, I hope I will be reasonably well off some day, I\u2019ll probably continue to work (though not that hard! - hard work does not make one rich!), but I definitely want more to be a sensible humane person with sufficient money in the pocket for the good things in life (good food, a comfortable home, sufficient money for the small hobbies that I have, and the discrimination to indulge in good things and listen to wise people / read good books). PS - about some people talking about travel and work - I traveled on work to 40+ countries on company tab as part of my work. Sure, I enjoyed it, and you will if you are 30 or 40 - but its charm fades. You don't become rich just because you work and travel to interesting places! PS2 - Being rich is over rated. Being comfortably off is under rated. ",

You need a large income, if you buy 20 income properties a year for 20 years; you might make $40 million or more. But, income properties often cost $20k to buy a property that pays $10 a month. That may be worth it in 30 years when it\u2019s paid off, but only if you make $600k a year after taxes and invest 2/3. If you can buy property worth $150k for $100k and some quick improvements, you can buy them all day long as long as the rent pays the expenses; but these are not as common as 30 years ago (they always took skill to find, it\u2019s harder now.) Tyler Hicks wrote a book on the subject, I never got off the ground when I tried. I\u2019d say the lessons I learned by not doing them would be get a job with a good income and focus on 1 project at a time (only doing 1 project, outside of your job at work; until you are done or it fails and you give up.)

            "answer_text": "In a word: leverage. Quick point of reference is that you can be rich but not wealthy and you can be wealthy but not rich and you can be both. Rich is having money, regardless of income or time. A lottery winner is rich (probably temporarily). A pro athlete is rich. Wealth is having an income regardless of your actions. A recording artist can be wealthy as they get residuals on their music. A landlord is wealthy as he/she collects rent. A business owner with multiple locations tends to be wealthy. Trading hours or work for income is never wealthy. Wealth is non-energy income. Once it is built, it keeps the money flowing. To become wealthy you need to leverage your idea(s) and/or skills. Investment in people is the ultimate wealth builder. However, it also is risky. Maybe you start a business with the intent to create residual income. Maybe you invest in someone else\u2019s idea to gain a part of that income. Maybe you leverage you talent or skill (writing, recording, programming, coding, etc). Any plan you implement needs to have a roadmap to gaining you residual income either by performance (stocks, biz) or market (art, goods/services sold). There are hundreds of books and videos and thousands of methods. You need to find what works for you. Just don\u2019t trade hours for income as a wealth building vehicle. It is great for starting out or bill paying, but in and of itself, not a wealth builder. ",

            "answer_text": "Eight years ago, I asked same question to myself instead of Quora. as if, to be a rich by asking or writing on Quora, then Balaji Viswanathan (\u0baa\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0b9c\u0bbf \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0bb8\u0bcd\u0bb5\u0ba8\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0ba9\u0bcd) would be the richest person of India and Mukesh Ambani would have followed Balaji Viswanathan on Quora. But for me, meant to be a rich was determined digits which can be converted into rupees or bank balances. There is a fascinating but real incident of my life to convert these fictitious digits into bank balance, About which I briefly inform you here. In 2011, I attended the IBPS Bank Clerk examination. There were 547 vacancies for clerks and total 12 lakh forms were filled up. I passed the examination and my relatives also wanted that I do a government job. But I refused to join that job and continued to work in a private company where I got salary mere 5000 rupees per month. My decision to annoy the family members and relatives also. At that time I had no reason to tell them that I didn't want to do job permanently but I have desire to start my own business of manufacturing of bearing. I suffered a lot but anyhow passed it. After that everything was well settled as i expected and on an occasion, my maternal uncle met me and asked, \u201cHow did you settle the business so soon?\u201d My conciliatory answer was, \u201cWhen I passed the bank exam, I realized that 12 lakh youngsters are busy in exams only. They are not interested in profits but only interested in salary. So thought that the whole ground is empty in the business. I have to compete only with the old people who are here beforehand. So that I decided to compete with 12 people instead of 12 lakhs and the result is here today.\u201d ",

People don't want to be millionaires--they want to experience what they believe only millions can buy. $1,000,000 in the bank isn't the fantasy. The fantasy is the life-style of complete freedom it supposedly allows. What is 'rich' meaning for you? And you might be already rich without knowing it. Think about it. Goodluck :) FRIENDLY ADVICE:You might fall under these two category. You should avoid it. 1. Work like a slave and get rich afterwards. But you're already old.2. Get rich quick and you think you already figured it out how easy it was. One day millionaire, don't care about the next day. To avoid that:1. Work smarter not harder. 2. Get some security. Think before spending.  That's all. ",

If you can make sure your basic needs are met, that your need for laughter and play are met and can you give of your time and energy to others you have wealth. And you can live in poverty and do this. I know people who live on $10K a year and are wealthy. Their lives are set up so that they make their own food, use solar, make or trade for things and their expenses are low. They spend half their time in service to others or in play. They are very happy and consider themselves wealthy. They accept their good and bad luck equally, they know that physical pain can be part of life. They tend to flow.I know plenty of execs who have plenty of money and don\u2019t feel or would label themselves as wealthy. They don\u2019t sleep well, they fight what is and I wouldn\u2019t call them wealthy either. The Dali Llama said that the United States was the poorest country had been to and India the wealthiest. In India they may not have access to what other countries do but they have an infrastructure where needs are met and joy and celebration is created on the regular. When you are in the same living conditions as those around you, it\u2019s easier to feel happy and wealthy with your needs met, than if you are around others in higher standards of living leaving you to feel like a victim.So wealth is very dependent on where you live and what you have access to. Maslow\u2019s Hierchy of Needs works so far in most all living situations to describe wealth and happiness. ",

            "answer_text": "You want to be rich? Are you looking for quick fixes to become rich? If you are then this answer is not for you. Often times you have to work hard and creatively to build your wealth. Here I am sharing 5 practical tips which will set you on your path to riches. These techniques will work only when you combine them with your knowledge. That is when the magic happens. Increase your Bank BalanceIf you want to build a fortune for yourself then it is wise to start by utilizing the already setup income source rather than from a new one. But how can you do that? Set aside one-tenth of your earnings for at least a year. Do not spend them unless you are in a very grave situation. With the remaining nine-tenth of your earnings, make your budget for necessary expenses. But remember this: what we call our necessary expenses will always grow to equal our income unless we practice self control. Try to cover your necessities, enjoyments and your worthwhile desires within the ninth-tenths part of your earnings. I have prepared a graph for easy understanding. You can see below, if you set aside mere Rs.5000 every month for a year then you will be richer by 50,000 Rupees than you are today.  Now what to do with this money? 2 Make Your Savings Multiply Through Investing These savings we build from our earnings are just a start. Standalone, they are not helpful. But if you invest them at right place with adequate knowledge then you will get returns in unprecedented amount. Following aphorism was found written on a clay tablet in the ruins of Babylon: \u201cA man\u2019s wealth is not in the coins he carries in his purse; it is the income he builds, the golden stream that continuously flows into his purse and keeps it always bulging. That is what every man desires, an income that continues to come whether you work or not.\u201d I cannot tell you where to invest. This is your responsibility to figure out. However when you get returns, be sure to invest those returns as well. First principle is still applicable here. Keep aside one-tenth of these returns and invest the remaining nine-tenth part. For your convenience, I have attached a graph showing a principal of $1000 when lent on a 5.3% compound interest and a deposit of 10$ monthly will give you $9,587 at the end of 10 year period.  Always play a long term game. Sacrifice your today for a better tomorrow. 3 Guard Your Treasures From Loss You must guard your money with firmness else it will be lost. Misfortune always strikes when you least expect it. Invest only where your principal is safe, where it may be possible to reclaim it when desired. Where you will not fail to get a fair return. Remember this aphorism which was written 1000s of years from today: \u201cJust as weeds grow in a field wherever the farmer leaves some space for their roots, even so freely desires grow in men whenever their is a possibility of them being gratified.\u201d Desires are many but that which must be fulfilled are few. 4. Insure A Future Income No man can afford not to insure a future income for his old age and for the protection of his family no matter how prosperous his business and his investments may be today. It is responsibility of every man to make preparations for a suitable income when he is no longer to work and to make preparations for his family should he be no longer with them to comfort and support them. All of above techniques are useless if you do not follow the 5th one. 5. Increase Your Ability To Earn This is the most vital of all the techniques to become rich. Preceding every accomplishment is a strong and definite desire. You should have strength of purpose and a strong definite desire of getting rich. This is how wealth is accumulated: first in small sums, then in larger ones as a man learns more and becomes capable. Show more interest in your work, more concentration upon your task and more persistence in your efforts. To become rich you must cultivate your own powers, study and become wiser, become more skillful and always be in the front ranks of progress lest you be left behind. ",

Note : Only one who become \u201cmoney conscious\u201d ever accumulate great riches. \u201cMoney conscious\u201d means that the mind has become so thoroughly saturated with the desire for money, that one can see one's self already in possession of it. Eg:Columbus dreamed of an unknown world, staked his life on the existence of such a world and discovered it! \u201cThe greatest achievement was, at first, and for a time, but a dream\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Wealth = Uniqueness X Scale EXAMPLE $1,000,000 = $1,000 X 1,000 clients Can you create a unique product or service, based on your uniqueness (talent, passion, experience, etc.) and sell to 1,000 clients? Or $1,000,000 = $100 X 10,000 clients Same thing here. It doesn\u2019t have to be a $100, it can be 2 different products priced at $50 and which you sell to the same clients. You can change a million to a billion, it doesn\u2019t matter, the principle remains the same. Secret: Before you \u201cdo\u201d, understand what you \u201care.\u201d You embody a WORLD of riches, so first explore that world within. Discover your native treasures. Grow them, nurture them, refine them. Polish your native talents, abilities, God-given gifts, qualities, etc. until they become DIAMONDS. In short, what you should do to become rich, will flow naturally from what you are. Your true nature. Seneca wrote a long time ago: \u201cA happy life is one lived according to its nature.\u201d Thus, Warren Buffett and Pablo Picasso are equally \u201crich\u201d as they both lived according to their own nature. Picasso once said: \u201cGive me a museum and I will fill it.\u201d Arrogance? I don\u2019t think so. Just a keen and just appreciation of his true nature, and how he could leverage it to produce art. Isaac Asimov, the science-fiction writer, wrote 300 books in his lifetime. He used nothing but an electric typewriter! (No word processor, his technique was never to edit himself while he was writing). So what is YOUR true nature? Many people are looking for a job, but the REAL work lies first in exploring the vast inner world that you contain, and discover the treasures of that world within. Treasures that nobody but you can discern, discover and appreciate. If you don\u2019t appreciate who and what you, neither will the world around you. Honor your talent, honor your gifts, honor the unique being that you have grown into throughout the course of your life. Discover what you are uniquely qualified to do, my friend, and you\u2019ll be so happy doing what you enjoy and providing a useful service that you won\u2019t pay too much attention to this colored piece of paper that people pass around to secure goods and services. Because that\u2019s what it is. Don\u2019t aim to have as many of those pieces of paper as possible. It is just paper. What\u2019s most important is to FEEL ALIVE doing, every day, what you love to do. What no one can stop you from doing. That is true wealth. ",

And ever since you guys have been bugging me to make more, so today I'm gonna be giving you EIGHT more tips on making money, investing,saving money, and not LOSING money. These are all things that have helped me build wealth at a really young age and I know they'll help you too! And this video is sponsored by Blinkist, thisBlinkist guy over here has been bugging me for weeks to talk about his app so we\u2019ll talk more about him and his books at the end. Bonus Tip: Don't do things that are unproductive! So instead of a long intro, I'm just gonna jump right into the tips. #1. Start early. If you're young, don't put it off. Start NOW. I knew people in college who thought \"durrr no point thinking about that now, I got my entire life to do that\" and then as soon as they got out of college they ended up getting trapped in the cycle of working a shitty job to pay for crap they don't even care about, and years later they haven't saved a dime or made any progress. Even guys I used to think were smart, completely stagnated. Don't let yourself get stuck in the paycheck- to- paycheck cycle - and don't think that just because you have a decent job, you won't get trapped:in the Wolf of Wall street book, Jordan Belfort ridicules his employees for living paycheck-to- paycheck on million dollar salaries, because they all assumed the money would keep coming in forever and they bought houses and cars and boats and all this other stuff, so as soon as the money stopped, they were broke. He even encouraged this behavior on purpose because he wanted to keep them trapped working for him instead of retiring. This is how the system works for most people. No matter how much they make, they spend moreas their income increases, this is called \u2018lifestyle inflation\u2019. Just look at the people you know and you'll see that almost all of them are trapped in the cycle. Don't let yourself be one of those people. It's just like when you're about to hook up with a girl and she says her boyfriend is coming over in 5 minutes - bro, get in and get out and fast as possible. This doesn\u2019t apply to everyone, but fora lot of people - a paycheck replaces your freedom, and in my experience as a thousand year old God, freedom is priceless. So work on getting your own financial freedom as early as possible. No amount of money from a paycheck can replace the freedom of having nobody telling you what to do, what to wear, and when to show up. Life is short. Get that freedom as fast as humanly possible,and get a headstart by starting young. #2. Try a bunch of things. Start your own businesses, even if you know nothing about business, just try it out. You don't have to spend a lot of money. The internet makes it easy to start a business with almost ZERO dollars in startup costs. Even \u2026.??? ___________\u2728\u2728____\u2728\u2728__ Thanks for reading \u270d\ufe0f Go to Quora Space to get premium content for free. #Quoraspace #MoneyMaking #millionairemindset #millionaire #8toMAKEMoney #2020 #newideas ",

            "answer_text": "Several things, but overall, it\u2019s tougher than it might seem. Avoid debt. It\u2019s easy to borrow money, through getting into debt. But the more one can avoid debt, the greater the chances for financial success. The largest form of debt in a person\u2019s life is a mortgage. It is almost inevitable that to live in nice surroundings, one must have a mortgage. And a mortgage is acceptable, as long as one doesn\u2019t periodically move to a larger mortgage, from a lesser one. But, avoid doing that - live beneath your means, not above your ability to pay, or even AT your ability to pay;Save as much money as you can. No matter how much money you make, save some: do without things that are not ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL to your basic survival. You may enjoy life less, but as you get older, with your savings accumulating, you will not have missed the finer things, and you\u2019ll be better off in the long run;Do without those things which are not essential. They require money, and you\u2019re both trying to live conservatively, as well as trying to avoid debt. Sure, that means sacrificing, but it also means more accumulation of money, and as you age, you\u2019ll be increasingly glad that you did.If you can follow these simple guidelines, you\u2019ll be accumulating wealth, as well as moving through life more simply. It may not produce continuing happiness, but it will set you up for later in life, when you\u2019ll look back and be glad that you took these actions to better prepare for the future. But, admittedly, much easier to think about, than to actually execute\u2026 ",

Riches, earthly riches, physical abundance is given to those who are able to receive it. In order to receive it, your mindset has to be right. It says, and I paraphrase, \u201cto those who have, more will be given,\u201d and \u201cto those who don't have, the little that they do have will be taken from them.\u201d Where ever you are right now, whatever you have, thank God for all he has done for you. Give God his proper/just credit for your life. Live your life in this mindset that you are already wealthy because God has already blessed you with much. Then wait for the Lord to open up/ redirect more wealth to you. Also, there is a way you can test your mindset. Take a $20 dollar bill, crumble it up into a ball. Then the next time you are walking somewhere, throw it away like it is just a piece of trash. You are essentially giving away $20. However, don't tell anyone you did this, don't even pay attention to where it lands, after you throw it away. This sounds so simple, but it is hard to do. The only person who can do this, and walk away, without worrying is the person, who believes that despite losing the $20, that God will bless them with more, or that they will get it back. These are the kind of people who the Lord gives physical abundance. I hope this helps. ",

Your family are already rich and you get some but that means someone in your family already did one of the following 3 options.Gamble. That may mean winning by total chance or professional gambling where you study a lot and increase the odds in your favour. With the latter it overlaps with number 3.Work. This is the option that most people take and can be split generally into 2 categories.Do - Doing a job for a company that is owned by someone else. This is what 99% of people do. Innovation is minimal and getting \u2018rich\u2019 this way is hard. Those who do it generally transition into 3b.Innovate - Find a niche in the market and cater for it. This is risky and a lot of new businesses fail but the rewards can be huge. It also takes a huge amount of work generally compared to 3a. Think of all the rich people you know of and likelihood they fit in here. Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg etc.Crime. Rob houses, banks, embezzle (started off in 3a or 3b), launder money, counterfeit money, deal drugs or be a pimp etc etc. Again high risk for the obvious reasons but the rewards can be huge. Crime does pay for some people but they are rare and unless you like being paranoid I would stay clear.So there you have it\u2026\u2026.Which one do you choose? ",

            "answer_text": "\u200eThe easiest way to become rich is by providing solution to people and organization's problems, and then monetizing your solution to their problems so that they will pay you for helping them solve their problems. The above strategy is only applicable if you want to become rich legally without indulging in crime. Another easy way to become rich is by buying and selling. You can start buying and selling online, but make sure what you are buying and re-selling are what people need and ready to pay for to avoid buying what won't sell. And at the end, it still boils down to providing solutions to people's problems through several ways, including buying and selling mentioned above. Now the question is, how do I achieve the above? 1. Create an action plan Everyone desires to be rich but only few end up becoming rich and you know why? Simply because those that failed to become rich didn't act on their desire to become rich. They only wished and never had an action plan to achieve their wish or goal. You want to be rich? What can you do to solve one or two major problems in your present environment? Acquiring a degree from the best university in the world can guarantee you a good pay job but may never guarantee that you will be rich except you are a problem solver. I grew up in a very poor family in Nigeria, my father worked with the Federal ministry of Agriculture as a low income earner and my mother was into petty trading business that hardly put food on the table. Unfortunately, my parents total income a month was never enough to feed the family, you can imagine the situation yourself. I was only 10 when my father got retired and we relocated back to the village because my parents couldn't afford the house rent in the town. As soon as we moved back to the remote village, we ventured into peasant farming and every other petty human activity done in the remote village to put food on our table. But I didn't know this was only a tutelage process for the greater challenge ahead of me. Haven lived in the village, done dirty jobs and witnessed abject poverty firsthand, I promised myself that I must be rich in order to help my family and community. Out of struggles, I managed to finish secondary school and got admission into higher institution, and managed to graduate but then, no job in the country, and the few available jobs were hijacked by people in government and top management positions for their wards. I ended up working in a very demeaning job that couldn't pay for my daily upkeep to talk of saving for future. Future became bleak for me as I began to lose hope, but something in me kept pushing me not to give up too soon, so I pressed on. Due to my struggles while growing up in the village, I became a workaholic and in fact, smart-thinker always coming up with great ideas. My colleagues saw me as a genius and thought I was from a rich family, but little did they know that I was a village boy who has seen the very worst side of life. To cut the story short, I found my strength in my passion. What was my passion? Writing and trading, so I capitalized on my two main passions and they saved me from poverty today. I changed jobs but couldn't find one that paid me enough to save, I had to start blogging. From blogging about life, health, relationship, etc, I started making money through Google Adsense, and the day I received my very first check in 2011 was like a dream come true. I made close to $1,000, something I have never made in my whole life, I made it online just like that without spending a dime. I put in more effort and the money kept on coming and started saving. From my savings, I ventured into my second passion: trading business, using internet as my selling platform, and today I make nothing less than $100 everyday selling different things online. From my story, you should be able to pin-point what liberated me from poverty: my passion! Wealth is in our individual passions and hobbies. Go back now and study that thing you love doing right from when you were small, not just what you studied in school. That thing you enjoy doing from childhood is where your financial success lay. Another point to take home here in trying to become rich is: use your skill, talent or passion to solve people's problems and then monetize your solution to their problems and watch money roll in with ease. Even though I am not rich right now, but I can see a very bright future ahead of me and I am now in charge of my life; I no longer work for anybody, I have lots of time to myself and I am now working on bigger things that will place my name of the world's richest list sooner by God's grace. So to become rich in life, you must make use of your passion, talent or skill to solve societal problems and then monetize your solutions and scale up from there. One thing about becoming rich is, once you are successful in one business or venture, it will become easier for you to succeed in most other of your financial endeavors. \u200e The internet is a good tool to use to support your goal to become rich, that's if you know how to make good use of it.\u200e Hope this helps?\u200e ",

Just when you think you have a lot of money and can splurge on something\u2026STOP! Keep saving up! Eventually you will save up enough to be able to invest that money. Do research on ways you can invest, although the most accessible one would be to do stock trading. As you keep saving up, make sure your bank account has an unofficial \u201cminimum balance\u201d that you never go below. Most rich people became rich by making very good decisions that benefitted them in the long term and also got very lucky. You need to tell yourself that you don\u2019t need to buy things that aren\u2019t necessary, especially if it is something you want just because your friends have it also. Make life decisions that help you fulfill long term goals. Don\u2019t invest too much time on entertainment and short term benefits. Don\u2019t save up so you can buy something big. You have to behave like you are on a tight budget even when you are not so you can have a \u201cbuffer\u201d of cash in your bank when you really need it. ",

What do you like to do? This is important because you will not achieve any level of success you hate the method necessary to reach your goal. If you like selling, then you are probably half way there. If on the other hand you have already made up your mind that selling is not for you, then your choices will be limited to something else. I've run a number of businesses and it doesn't matter whether it is management consulting or affiliate marketing - when someone tells me they want to be part of my organization but then qualifies the conditions as not involving sales, then I know they are not serious.How hard are you willing to work to get what you want? Carrie Fisher the actress once said that \"the trouble with instant gratification is that it takes too long\". That does seem to sum up the attitude far too many people have. They want all the good things in life but are not willing to put in the effort.Do you know the difference between having a lot of money and being rich? Read Robert Kiyosaki's Rich Dad Poor Dad books. There are people who appear to be wealthy, but are really quite poor, they owe too much, have too much credit card debt, etc.So back to your original question. What should you do?Find something you can enjoy (you won't always enjoy it, there will be bumps in the road - that's life). Then work at it. The trick though is after an putting in the initial start-up money do not spend more that you earn. Build assets not do-dads (Robert Kiyosaki again). Good luck. ",

It was around the year 2000, and buying a tech stock was supposed to be an immediate path to wealth. That\u2019s why I only spent a few hours reading a broker\u2019s report before making the purchase. Cisco was rumored to be interested in acquiring this company. So why do more work? There was no easy way to get more money. I was already working two part-time jobs on campus to help pay for my MIT degrees. The little spending money that I had would have to be stretched further \u2013 no going out on weekends until I could rebuild from this disaster. And then Warren Buffett came to speak on campus. Here was this really successful investor who was talking about: Competitive advantageIntrinsic valueInvesting for the long-termListening to Buffett speak made me realize I hadn\u2019t been investing \u2013 I had been speculating. I had no investing philosophy. No investment process. I had spent almost no time understanding the industry the company was in. I had no idea if it had a sustainable competitive advantage Or what it was worth. I realized I was going to have to spend considerable time if I wanted to learn how to invest. Time that was already really scarce. I started reading everything I could find on value investing. Buffett Partnership letters. Berkshire Hathaway Annual Letters. Security Analysis. As I learned the basics of investing, I began to understand the more advanced concepts. I was no longer tempted by the hot tech stocks. Now, I was looking for durable businesses. I was fortunate to get an investing job with Fidelity Investments. I found a great mentor there, one who followed the same intrinsic value approach that Buffett advocates. Then I became a Senior Equity Analyst at another firm, then eventually, I became a Portfolio Manager. Now, more than 15 years later, I am the Chief Investment Officer of my own investing firm. I have used the investing readings that I have put together to mentor many aspiring value investors. If you are just beginning to invest, first ask: Are you an investor or a speculator? Will becoming rich make you happy? I think that in general money can help you avoid misery, but it won\u2019t really make you happy. What does? Meaningful relationships, experiences, satisfaction of achieving one\u2019s goals, meditation. ",

That\u2019s how you can become rich. If you choose to do philantropy, here\u2019s some advice on how to do it: \u201cBe careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven. So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.\u201d (Matthew 6:1\u20134) ",

You are born for something. There are many remaining innovations that are not invented. Each person have their own invention that anyone cannot have same but some of them can get. Just imagine that you are child and you don't know how babies are born. And you also think that god give us baby after marriage. But after research from book then you knows the real truth about that how humans are born. My words is telling you that every person have innovative thinks but they can't invite until they can't find truth behind innovation. Looks take my life's example. I am ordinary person but i have more thoughts, quotes, innovation, plans, ideas, future and many more. But i can't able to do that because i don't have money for that. But there are not a 100 percent chance of success. My mind is fulfilled with motivational thinks but i failed in many works, in Exam, gym (i do gym for 2 months and my muscles have gained and later i quite gym and after 3 month i turn more slim than average). As well as i have hearing problem also because i am deaf. I always think myself that i am special and thoughts that i already have my dream in present and i visualise in front of my eyes that i am too damn rich.

The key is who you know, working smart, and investing in smart people by following them, and communicating with them. Start hanging with the wealthy, for you are who you mingle with. I talk with Ellen DeGeneres online and Joe Vitale. I\u2019ve contacted Bill Gates and Warren Buffett to let them know what I think of them. They all know me. I would like to go on the Ellen DeGeneres show and maybe I will. Invest in yourself is number 1. Be confident and go for it, remember people are only people who are willing to take a chance or not depending how you come across to them. Investing money is a good idea to gaining more, contact Warren Buffett for that. These are only ideas that may or may not work out for you. Thank you Steven, good day to you! Donna Thompson ",

            "answer_text": "So you want a plan to be rich then you should learn from the best  Jeff Bezos - Amazon Bill Gates - Microsoft Warren Buffet - Investor - Berkshire Hathaway Bernard Arnault - Louis Vuitton + other brands Carlos Slim Helu - Movil (telecoms company) We can go down this and all you will see is founders, CEOs and investors. So that\u2019s how you get very rich: start a business, be a very good investor, become a very well paid CEO or get it by family connections such as inheriting. However that does not help us too much it only tells us what they did NOT how they did it and that\u2019s important whilst we can\u2019t analyse what every single person did in great detail we can create a basic game plan and it depends on which style you prefer and understand better the investor or the founder. If you want to be an investor I cannot stress enough that you should read the richest man in babylon but here is a summary :) Put away 10% of your income - whatever your income is you can most definitely budget and control your expenses to save up 10% of your incomeWhen you have a fair amount of income saved (you could start with even as little as $100)Where to invest your money - invest it into sectors that you understand, study the sector before you start investing your money into it and listen to people who are experts in the given field. Your neighbor is NOT a good investment advisor you should speak to people who are active in the field that you want to invest in.And there you go if you follow this simple process and then reinvest the proceeds once again then you will be rich. What you have to remember is that you will lose money sometimes not every investment will be positive so you have to learn, try again and in time your investments will become more profitable. Now the second method is to start your own business. This is a completely different game and it's much harder to do in the beginning but much easier to do once the business gets big. And there are a few steps Start the businessGrow it as big as possible, do NOT stop investing a lot of time and money into it - that way it may fail and definitely will not grow fast enoughContinue growingAnd yeah that the basic plan through the in and outs of running your own business is a lot more intricate the basic plan still holds and it should help to get you started on your journey to riches. I wrote this answer to the question \u201cwhat\u2019s the best plan to become rich\u201d so sorry for any small inaccuracies but the bulk of the answer still holds ",

It\u2019s really that simple, and yet by default we\u2019re all programmed to only think of ourselves .

Randomly reading this answer isn\u2019t enough either. You have to truly capture the underlying truth, and intent of what you\u2019re doing and why you\u2019re doing it. It will take years to get this through practice. When some of my riders told me this, I just nodded and so will you.

            "answer_text": "The best way to make money online unfortunately is through hard work, in what ever business you get into.Its like a building a house the foundations have to be done correctly, you have to lay it down from day 1.The most effective way i think is in affiliate marketing, you dont have a brick and mortar company that is done in a office were you have to staff wages to think about or equipment.But you sell someone else product, the main foundations is not knowing were to start, if its a affiliate platform selling your on their idea or product to get rich but you have no idea how to get.Those who start out dont now have any clue how is is to be done never mind correctly, if you look at facebook groups these people who just post their links but they dont have any clue about affiliate marketing or the very components of how it all works, it is like if you weren't trained how to build a house you wont let someone do it without the necessary skills or http://knowledge.It is the very same in affiliate marketing or building a business, i do admit it is about getting traffic to a affiliate website or http://link.My first advice when started out is to focus on one traffic method, as there are many different traffic methods and later on i choose one and give some advice on it.I first talk about what affiliate marketing being set up from what ever affiliate network or program you use.You are given a affiliate link which is usually a very long link, but as most networks block these links you can shorten the link like using a company called bitly will shorten it for you.I do prefer a tracking software called click magic, and what you can do with this software which does cost $20 a month you can put ur link in the program, and then copy several times use one for you tube facebook etc, and you called the link deepening were your using, and by doing this you can track how many clicks you have received.this is very helpful as u can tell were to scale up your business, but that is not the end of another key competent you must have is calledA Capture page and what this is a pre page were users agree to put in their name and email this is usually a pre page that is attractive page telling uses what the website is about before they gave consent to access it.But its not just that we use a program called get response or a weber and this would sent the users details to this program we we are allowed to store their details and with this we can follow up with them via http://email.As it is proven people dont buy first time the access the site normally 5 or 6 times.This is called building a list and this is essential in email marketing, they say money is in the list and it is very true.it is a very difficult skill to master email marketing as it usually takes years but when we do and we will it is like a very own atm machine, when we need some sales we send a email out to our list and when they purchase our product we get paid a commissionIt does take trust to build up and we use a method called a email follow up series and we would write a series of emails so we can get to know our listI think instead of focusing on many different methods if you are a new start its best focus's on one traffic method and learning to master one method before trying out http://others.So once we have affiliate offer i suggest we try one of the biggest platforms in the world and that is Facebook.And what we want to do ideally is to create a facebook account just created for business no family or friends on itSo we go on the facebook and create a new account, and we want to create a nice business like photo.And another essential competent on getting sales is the profile as i know i have got a few sales just from the profile, what ever product we are promoting, to just say a few lines about this in the description and also post our link there too.For when we learn to build our facebook account which we will learn shortly we can just getting website visitors from people just clicking the link on her profile.Before we ever post anything what we want to do is to build up friends ideally about 20 friends per day looking for people with similar interests like make money online work from home etc.The best people to add are from a facebook group called im watchdog or just searching for people via facebook search using the right search times like work from home etc.And when they accept us as friends, we can go on facebook messenger not spam them our links as this is poor marketing, but just generally chat to them and when have built rapport then we can share with them, the key is to always ask permission.Sometimes they will buy, sometimes they wont, we can always building a relationship they might have skills that we might do in the future, they might be a solo ad vendor or have expertise on ads for eg.When we have built up say over 1000 friends when can they post on our facebook wall, and when they see this we can connect with them.One thing when doing this method we never just post a link, as this will not provide engagement, but we ask them to comment on the post then we can connect with them further.Facebook groups isnt the best way to market because everyone is doing this, but sometimes we can ask for info on someone has a post on a facebook group so they will pitch their idea, and through this method we can after chatting can pitch our idea i found it can go in our favour.We want to try and grow our facebook account to 4\u20135k friends then it gets very interesting because when we post valuable content, we will get good engagement and believe using the posting method and prospecting the correct way you begin to build a authority on facebook and can make a lot of money.The best programs to get involved are training programs were you learn affiliate marketing like learn while you earn.And that is the route i have taken and it works well for me i hope someones finds this answer helpful and will help them get rich so to speak.[1] Footnotes[1] Quorra doc",

            "answer_text": "To become rich you will need more than one good solid source of income. Successful people usually have more than 4\u20135 sources of Income. Most of the income generating way will involve below: Only one thing you have to do. Not that simple though. Start SELLING. You need to innovate make some products which makes life easier. At the same time, you need to learn selling. People can have best of the products but if you can\u2019t sell those then no point. You can\u2019t make big money. Any billionaire must be selling something. Banker sells products. Insurance guy sells protections through emotions Mutual fund guy sells dreams of making big money by investing FMCG guy sells products which can be consumed Real estate guy sells ambition through emotions Steve Jobs used to sell luxury. Microsoft sells productivity by offering lot of tools. Amazon sells efficiency by providing lot of options and delivering it fast. Facebook thrives on human emotions. So get going. Start SELLING. One day you will become a Billionaire. Alternatively, people also suggest that you should invest and agreed that too. Let compounding act in your favour. But for that you need to start really early. like early to mid 20s. With 15% returns on monthly investment of Rs. 20,000 in standard product of Mutual Fund for 30 yeas will give you 14+ crores at the end. But if you start at 20 with same numbers then your end corpus will be more than 60+ crores. So, start early investing and start Selling. All the best! Thanks! ",

Winning it in any quantity is difficult because of the laws of probability. Inheriting only works if you\u2019ve got wealthy family members who are fond of you. So for most people the options are working for it or marrying it. Not surprisingly people with money aren\u2019t usually inclined to marry poorer people who are only after easy access to wealth.

            "answer_text": "You get wealthy when you know how the monetary system works and become an informed and active player in this system. I\u2019ll explain the system in phases. Employee phase: Let\u2019s say you start a job after finishing your education. You start working for others (owner/shareholders of your company). You feel that you\u2019re paid well. This puts you in a comfort zone and thus you yourself close the door of getting rich. You spend life salary-to-salary and end it as a poor middle class. Self-employed phase: If you\u2019re poorly paid as an employee or you realize that being an employee won\u2019t make you rich, you may think of running your own business. As a small business owner you work for yourself. If you could not do it well, you may close your small business and become an employee again. And if you manage it well and have further urge to get rich, you may become a businessman. Businessman phase: In this phase, others work for you. You have leverage of time and money. Failing in business may force you to become an employee or self-employed person again. If you\u2019re successful in business, this may put so much money in your pocket that you may advance to next stage of getting rich. Investor phase: When you have enough money in your pocket, then you may put your money work for you. When your money works for you and it multiplies due to compound interest, you feel rich because you have time to enjoy and financial freedom to afford almost anything. Well there could be following combinations: a) An employee + investor (you have little money to invest and hence can\u2019t get rich) b) A self-employed + investor (You may be better than previous combination but still you won\u2019t be as rich as person with next combination) c) A businessman + investor (This is what to real rich class belongs to. A good business covers their losses in investment and also provides them great leverage of money.) If you notice, on each stage, you need certain personal traits and classified knowledge to succeed. So, the best you can do to get rich is: Get knowledge of how economy worksGet knowledge of finance and budgetingGet knowledge of monetary systemLearn some key skill to productivityLearn management and marketingUpdated knowledge of current affairsAnd the personal traits to develop are: Willingness to learn new thingsCourage to take risksLearn from failures and not to discourage yourselfGreed to get rich",

Simply showing mercy does not prove your sympathy.If you can do such things you will have enough richness in your heart to conquer this world provided you choose Love as the way of life. If you meant for bank account (money)\u2026then Build a time machine. Go back to 2011. Buy enough Bitcoins. Come back to 2017. There you go. You will have enough money in your bank account to buy an aircraft carrier. but the question is what you gonna do with it. Because Life is not about buying an aircraft carrier it is about being human..is\u2019t it?? I wish we were all rich\u2026 thank you. ..U.. ",

            "answer_text": "EASY! But first, you have to know what rich IS. The measure of your wealth is not by your possessions and money alone. ( I have that on good authority, for sure). I have known many very wealthy people, I have also known many people with vast amounts of money who were not wealthy, in fact they were desperately poor. So, WHAT IS WEALTH? There are five aspects to being wealthy: Health: your physical and emotional state. If you don\u2019t have your health, you are poor indeed.Spirituality: understanding your place in the universe. Having a concept, as best you can of the nature of the cosmos and what God is as you may or may not conceive of Him.Relationships: having someone to love, and having that love reciprocated. Caring and having people care for you. Friends, relationships.Meaning: having a reason to live, a cause. For most of us, it is meaningful work, or a cause, a passion. For some of us, it is a dedication to helping others.Finances: having enough money so you aren\u2019t under undue pressure to meet basic needs. Having too much money can be a curse. Having the right amount is liberating. Live simply.I feel outrageously blessed to have all of the aspects of wealth, though I\u2019m a little short in number 5. So, that\u2019s a good thing. Helps me remain humble. And, I am humbled by the great wealth I have. I give thanks, several times a day. But I also realize that I am called to give back, to pass it along. That\u2019s not to say I don\u2019t have problems. We all do. It\u2019s the nature of existence, and the fundamental struggle that all living things must face. Strive to be Wealthy, not rich. Strive to do good, be generous, kind and compassionate. Always do the right thing. Create good Karma. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, the real richness and wealth comes from having a happy & fulfilled life. Things or money don\u2019t give us happiness. In my life I chased money, initially in my career I took a job only for the money, but did not enjoy at all, even though I was getting money, something big was missing. Luckily I found the job that I enjoyed eventually, of course the money was good, about 12 years of my life went in that, while I was in that job, I wanted fancy things, I bought my 1st BMW, which made me very happy, but I got bored after 6 months. Then I upgraded my BMW to another one much more powerful and even more smooth & prestigious, again after 6 months I got bored. Same thing with the home as well, I bought a good home and I was mowing the lawn forcefully every week, just to to make sure my home value does not go down, so whatever thing you get you will get bored after 6 months. Whatever you buy, you will get bored in 6 months and you want the next better thing. Again after 12 years, I felt like I was just doing it for the money, helping build someone else\u2019s dreams. We all think only the poor get diseases, get malnutrition, once you are wealthy all the problems will disappear, no that is not true, when you are poor you have poor people diseases, once you are rich you get rich people diseases. Same thing, when I was in India, looking at the quality of roads or the lack of roads, I thought the developed nations like USA, Germany, Japan etc have great roads, so life will be perfect there, no it is not, yes they do have great roads, but you know what they have huge traffic problems, they have great roads, great infrastructure, once accident happens, the entire city comes to a grinding halt, so whether you are rich or poor, there is always going to be some problem, some disease, something you are not going to be happy with, even if you have the most expensive fancy car, one day the car breaks down and your life is miserable, to be candid, the fancy cars break down more than the Honda and Toyota, which are much more reliable, so the point is just enjoy what you do, love what you do, do a great job with passion making a difference in someone\u2019s life, everything else falls in place. However if you focus on building something that is useful for somebody, that makes a difference in somebody\u2019s life and do something that gives you a sense of fulfillment, that will not only make you very happy, but also gives you a sense of meaning in life. That is exactly what I am doing now, however that is not easy, I am grateful to have this amazing people in my life that are helping me do that. This makes me feel much more richer, than I had the fancy BMW. If I continue this path, I can buy another BMW, but the point is here, the focus is on building something great, that makes a difference in people\u2019s lives, when you do that so passionately, everything else falls in place. So the focus is not doing something strictly for the money, which is when you are buying the flashy BMW for the sake of buying it. I think that is right way to be truly rich and wealthy. Hope this helps. Good Luck! ",

            "answer_text": "There is a simple formula to become rich. The formula is Wealth = max[(Savings)^(Rate*Time)] Step 1: Earn as much as possible and max out your (Savings/Earnings) ratio Step 2: Invest your savings wisely and try to compound it at maximum \u201cRate\u201d Step 3: Make sure you are able to do Step 1 and Step 2 for as long as possible - Maximize the Time To give a good example, lets consider the famous Warren Buffet. He saved a lot during his younger days. He compounded his money at more than 20% CAGR. He did this over a very long period of time (He started as a teenager and is now in his eighties). Most people speak about his compounding rate, but quite a few forget about the \u201cTime\u201d factor. One reason why he is so much rich is that he has lived long (along with the other two factors). So living a simple, healthy life not only helps you maximize your savings but also gives you a fair shot at maximizing the \u201cTime\u201d factor. How you do on the compounding rate will depend on your financial and behavioral skills, and a bit of luck as well. How you do on maximizing the (Savings/Earnings) ratio will depend a lot on your profession, lifestyle and some other factors. Theoretically, the formula is very simple. In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice, but in practice there is. ",

            "answer_text": "Rich is relative.  But over the years, I found out that there are 2 types of people. Those who would prefer to earn more than save more. And those who would prefer to save more than earn more. Which among the two are you? Personally, I fit in the latter category. I find it easier to control what I already have than what I could have. But interestingly, I found out that there is also a huge number who prefer the former category of earning more money than saving. Now, the trick that I found out is about balance, yin and yang, the value of moderation which is one of the most important life skills to have. What I realized is given that I can save easily, I should focus more on earning rather than saving. Another reason why is that you can only save so much but your earning potential is unlimited. Given my personality, I should strive on looking for more ways to earn more money. However, if your personality is of the opposite side of the coin, then you should focus more on saving rather than spending money. You find it already easy to earn and probably have accumulated a lot of wealth. With that scenario, you find that you\u2019re not getting richer but remain in equilibrium. Then it might be time to re-evaluate your spending habits and look for ways on how you can save more (or invest more to assets that can give you income). As much as possible, we should only save to have a decent emergency fund then invest the rest for our money to make more money. ",

            "answer_text": "The first thing we need to define is money. Money is stored labor. So money represents access to the labor product of others. From an evolutionary standpoint this implies that being 'rich' means you do not have to spend time getting food, collecting water and maintaining a shelter but can spend your time pursuing mates. As social animals we tend to be status conscious. The rich will often have items that indicate status within a social group that are signals to potential mates. Status items cost much more than their utility value. For example the utility value of a car is pretty much the same as most modern cars are very reliable and well engineered. Ferrari's are difficult to drive, unreliable and expensive to repair, however they are deemed desirable because of our atavistic ape brains. This seems to have been encoded into our DNA by the sexual selection of females primarily, as demonstrating that you have resources to waste. This makes you seem a better mate as those resources could be redirected to survival of offspring. ",

            "answer_text": "Brief answer: You\u2019d say the other answers may all be reasonably correct, though for a wrong question. According to plain logic, correct answer for wrong question is wrong --- something positive to negative is negative. \u2013 1 x (+ 1) = \u2013 1. The question should be asked this way: How can I survive? Yes? I become rich to survive and survive better. What is wrong with that? Yes, it is wrong: natural order favour life\u2019s extinction (because it forms recurrent closed cycles that cuts off future for life which is the biological information existence continuation). Competition for the limited material value to get rich and power is the natural mechanism to lock all life in the natural order that lead to life\u2019s extinction (when this life evolve to the level of intelligence) --- this is the natural way to survive in natural system that will lead to human extinction in manmade social system by natural law. Natural order carried by natural process sets human individual present interest against his own ultimate interest to extinct him. We can see that effect: micro-economic competition leads to macro-economic conditions deterioration that leads to most population worse off, future generations worse off, and finally extinction for all life. That is because the micro-economic competition solution is based on the wrong assumption of unlimited material value accessibility and human activities can create material value. The traditional economics confused use value (utility and function) with material value (systematic form of negative thermodynamic entropy, which is expressed as our resources and environment). Regardless it is in the capitalist system or socialist system, we see the same trend because they are all natural order-run manmade social systems. When blind mass follow blind assumption, disaster is bound to happen. More explanation: Life does compete the limited nature given material value to survive in natural process but when nature evolved out intelligence and this intelligence start to use its manmade order to build manmade structure, natural balancing mechanisms on benign level will be disabled and also natural order will start to act against manmade order to pull it back to natural state. This is the natural law: \u201cNatural order cap information evolution at the point of intelligence\u201d. Natural order derives out natural process, and natural process is a recurrent closed cycle that is default to cap life evolution at the point of intelligence and recycle it into energy finally to maintain the thermodynamic existence continuation of the non-living matter. But nature does leave a very narrow path for life to achieve its information existence continuation which is the rational meaning for survival --- use their rationality ability to adopt rational order to connect the natural process into a rational open process that lead to endless future. But due to natural order spontaneously and simultaneously destructing rational order and rational structure, it is extremely difficult to achieve far future. Though that is not a nature made mistake, it is just the natural selection mechanism on system level selection at work. This question (How can I become rich?) is a bit shallow and narrow, a bit childish as a modern human. Before we answer this question, we should answer a series of more meaningful questions first: Rich for what? What is the purpose for getting rich? What is life? What is the purpose for life? What is the relation between material value and use value? What is the relation between life and material value, What is the relation between life and use value? What is an individual\u2019s ultimate interest? What is the relation between individual present interest and his ultimate interest? What is the coincident effect of the stable behavioural strategy of everyone acts according his best of present individual interest? Where does this natural order lead this individual and all human to? How to maximise your interest? How can one fulfil his ultimate interest? When we solve problem we should deal with the fundamental cause of the problem. When we trace the cause of the problem we should trace to the most fundamental cause of the problem. When we have big dream, we should have this dream to the maximum --- the ultimate dream, and realise it. Otherwise, in the end, you have nothing, at all. That is because, the real rich is to own the endless future, is to own the universe. Why we have to be so complicated? Can we be just simple and natural as we did before for billions of years and as the result become the intelligent life as we are? No. That is because the reality is complicated after we become intelligent life, and we no longer can depend on natural order and natural process any more. It is true that the natural order carried by natural process had given us the rationality ability to recognise the natural laws in reality but it will be totally up to our own rational efforts to adopt the rational order carried by rational process to lead ourselves into endless future.

Or you are house wife neither working nor studying and have no interest in studying also. I am writing some Ideas from different perspective refer to the suitable for you. Student-Learn Some skills : First of all you need to understand that nothing is absolutely hard it depends to what extent you want to learn and how honestly you learn ( I have some friends who just keep book in their hand and pretend to be studying but they have no interest no care and no relation with that book in their hand and after that they say I have studied this subject for 8 hours for 10 hours but no result\u2026.. It is very HARD\u2026 this is just non sense not learning) learn properly what you can learn to the level of perfection and other things to particular level depending on your interest. If you have learnt to perfection something like Machine learning or Block chain or AI (you can learn online) you have big chance to get rich quickly as these have big demand in market ( If you really have learnt these not just pretended to do so)If you have no interest in tech or skills those have demand in market but have interest in other skill like painting and something like that. Still you can do a lot. Consider the position of person who has passion of painting and knows math science technology little bit. There is a lot of room for him to make money because this combination will provide him basic but new ideas as people\u2019s thought effected by what they have learnt and not many people have this combination.like this decide your self what will you learn and how will you make that skill effective. By combining different skills, different ideas of different people, reading books (very effective if you are not bound to just one type and want to explore world of written knowledge ) . If you want to understand it in more details ask question and request me by giving reference of this question.Worker - who has no interest in learning: The best idea is to start side business\u2026. Save some money from your earnings 20,000 to 30,000find some honest person in your friends or relative who is working (on monthly income basis, not owner) in particular business(selling cloths, selling accessories, selling footware) for long time like 5 years 6 years, experience is very valuable thing he must be knowing how does his boss work from where does he buy the product and how can he attract customers and start business with him.IFyou selected right person( experience, knowledge about field and market , honesty, hard working)selected right business or product ( some has margin 200% as I know my relative\u2019s business)Give him proper support in things those he can\u2019t do by himself like renting place and money investingThe last thing is give him target of how much he has to make in how much time and now you have successfully started your business which can make you rich if you keep increasing sells.Answer became quite long I will write more if someone wants to know about his particular situation. Just ask question and request me by reference of this question ",

I focus on looking at the components of who I am: my mind, body, and soul. My mind and soul don\u2019t need material things for them to feel rich. In fact, the more I focus on material, the less my mind and soul feel rich. They feel more like slaves to material wealth. They then don\u2019t have time or the energy to truly feel rich and happy as time is spent seeking how to get more wealth and comparing with others. That generally leads to unhappiness. And when the mind and soul are happy and feeling rich, somehow the body seems to follow! How to achieve richness in yourself does require work, but it has been my personal experience that every positive change to your mind and soul\u2019s richness gives far more happiness than any additional increment in your material wealth. Buying a new pair of shoes gives immediate gratification but does it lead to true long term, personal richness? So you may find that just thinking about what rich means to you may increase your level of richness far quicker than would investing in the share market! It doesn\u2019t mean you should stop holding material wealth; it just means defining what it is for YOU to be happy (not what others say) and then laying out a plan of how to achieve that happiness. For example, I found improving my relationship with my parents to be far more richly rewarding that adding $1750 to my bank account because my shares increased in value. The $1750 was nice and gave me an immediate buzz but that quickly disappeared as I then focussed on trying to get more money. Yet my relationship with my parents and the love and support they give me is a richness that doesn\u2019t stop giving. It is a permanent high. Define your richness goalposts in terms of your true happiness components and you may find you are closer to them than you think. ",

Everything in life passes away. Being rich means having trust, love, loyalty, respect, and compassion from others\u2026and giving them to yourself, too. The more you give, the more you\u2019ll get. Give to others what you want to have, and you\u2019ll soon discover a life of wealth and fulfillment. This is what I\u2019ve learned from chasing money, stupidly following my shallow attractions to women who were all wrong for me, and losing people I loved dearly. Money will never buy the best things for you\u2026nor can they be taken. They have to be earned\u2026they have to be given to you freely. And you\u2019ll get them by giving. That\u2019s all I know about life. ",

            "answer_text": "The question is not proper, it implies a certain limit to money, so a more proper question is, How do I become richer? That is the fundamental question of economy which can be rephrased as How does the value of money change over time using certain variables? One of the most important variables of all is how you decide to use money, or to invest it. The best way to invest money, or at least most economist would agree, is trading or lending money. This is because, depending on the type of loan a someone decides to loan go some someone, you get paid back Interest rate. Interest rate is the percentage of payment you get back from lending money. This all leads to the time principle of money, which states one dollar today is not the same on the future depending on how you invest it. It is recommendable you don't invest all your money or most on lending. This duo to the risk of the borrower not paying any interest rate at all, and not lending back your money. Instead, always use a certain percentage /100 is neither low to earn a small amount of money, but neither to high to be with no money if the borrower doesnt pay you back. The two previus paragraphs deal with how to invest money, earning additional in comparison to job, but how do we earn a lot in a job anyways? Unfortunately, most high paying jobs don't depend on high talent regarding the type of job, although most assume talent, but depend on high luck and strategy to convince the owner to accept you in. You might ask, why does the government allow for borrowers to not pay the lenders? This is because, if borrowers were enforced to do so, everyone would become rich on the same levels, leading to a communist form of economy. By by the way, I am a teen\u2026.. ",

There are also some people who can work their way to the top of the corporate ladder and might make 7\u20138 figure salaries as CEO\u2019s, Directors, Law Firm Partners, Head Surgeons, but they\u2019ll never be paid billions, the profits go to the people who invested and founded those businesses. However If you\u2019re talking about getting rich by building wealth, that takes financial discipline and wisdom. Most people build their wealth through private investments into stocks, bonds, real estate (flipping and renting homes, not living in them), collectibles, etc\u2026 The difference between wealth building and the above is that anyone with a little bit of extra income can do this. But it takes patience, you can\u2019t think about where you want to be tomorrow, you need to think about where you want to be 20 years from now, and where you want your kids to be. People who focus on building wealth almost never look wealthy, but they have the ability do things many people simply can\u2019t like buying their cars for cash, paying for college tuition in cash, being able to help their children buy homes when they\u2019re adults, etc\u2026 ",

Example: Mark Zuckerberg. Mark Zuckerberg though of making facebook which is unique. After a huge crowd of visitors now he is billionaire. What made Mark Zuckerberg to be a millionaire? The simple answer is facebook followers. The important point you need to remember is following is equal to money. The number of followers you have the more money you gain. The key trick to make followers into money is making something useful for them and getting paid in return. It might be products or something other. Lets take an another example: Warren Buffet Warren Buffet spent years in analysising stocks. Finally he became the worlds 3 richest person. Spending time on a perfect thing and learning a lot about it will make you rich. Knowledge is key thing, improve it everyday. Crypto currencies are the next big thing. There are plenty billionaires and millionaires made by crypto currencies. I had selected a crypto currency which is going to make me a millionaire soon. Hope you select one.

The volume plays the important thing for you to have high percentage to win. The second way is by learn how to do trading in forex market. Once you have mastered the technique on how to make entry point, take profit and stop loss, i can guarantee that you can make 2 times or more profit with the amount you invest in less than 3 months. But this is quite risky. Be careful The other way is start your own business with something you interested in. For example, if you are expert in drawing cartoon, try to make you own cartoon story a.k.a manga. If you love to cook, just make simple breakfast or lunch boxes and sell to your friends or office mate first. Try to build as many network as you can because that is the first way to market your business. But you need to think something rare or unique so sell because that will attract people. My advice is don\u2019t easily to give up if you can\u2019t get the result as soon as you want. Everything takes time. Success is depends on our patient. Progress is depends on our effort. ",

            "answer_text": "First, stop fooling yourself. You don't want to be rich. You want wealth to accomplish something, and for most people it is to make themselves feel secure. Money in itself is nothing. You want security or respect (ego-driven) or perhaps you want to be in the situation to help others you love.  So first of all think about why you want to be rich. By the way this question is written I would take it that you are young or immature. Most likely young.  Life will teach you soon - through a progression of various hard knocks - which direction you can go.  And the truth is you might be able to get what you really want and need without being wealthy.  Most people who have happy lives are not wealthy. And many people who have wealth are not happy.  So go beyond 'I want to be rich' and aim for your true goal. And it might be too early to know. And that is ok. ",

            "answer_text": "Make money, and being smart with how you spend your money. It\u2019s that simple. In this day and age it\u2019s very easy for people to be making money, the biggest issue that people have is that they spend way too much or don\u2019t make smart decisions with their money. They don\u2019t save up money in a savings account and instead spend their money on things that they don\u2019t need to impress people that they don\u2019t like. On top of that, the thing that most people spend their money on is on things that are outside of their pay bracket. In other words, people tend to take out massive loans in order to cover the costs. And having debt like that is the best way to kill any kind of wealth that you have. Instead what is suggested in basically every wealth book you\u2019ll ever read is to spend your money wisely. Invest in index funds, put a little bit into a savings account, and live within your own means. To do those things it does require you to do some math and accounting but it\u2019s mainly looking at where your money is going and setting up a budget that works for you. The reason wealthy people do this is so they know where their spending habits are and if it\u2019s a problem, they can curb them. This is also the same tactic that is used to help people get out of debt and develop their own wealth. ",

If you are truly interested in becoming rich, it's important to analyze why you want to become rich, and what rich means to you. For some people, rich means having the ability to spend more time at home with their family. For others, rich means being able to travel the world. And for others, it means not having to answer to anyone. I'd suggest outlining what you want out of life, what will make you happy. Investigate how much money you need to live that life. And then focus on the personal finance equation (spend less or earn more to have wealth). Spend less on things you don't care about, and earn more doing things that bring you closer to your ideal life. ",

If I want to be a millionaire, I will identify who are the millionaires who are in the same business as I am.  Then I will read all their books,  read all their posts, subscribe to their programs and learn  from them.  Some of the books that I will  recommend are: the Millionaire Mindset, and the Fastlane Millionaire, The Science of Getting Rich.  These books will shift your mindset about wealth. Mingle with people who are more successful and richer than you.  Watch your thoughts. Are they positive or negative thoughts. Are your empowering or  limiting beliefs?  Take massive action every day. Think of how you can massively add value to other people's lives, and solving people's problem.  The more people you help, the more you will be rewarded.  The fact that you have internet access means you are already rich, compared to many others living in dire situations.  Have a heart of gratitude to your God or the Universe that you are alive and well, and your basic needs are taken care of.  A grateful heart is a rich heart.  When you count your blessing every day, you know you are already rich.  ",

I have always been very interested in why some people are more successful than others and in turn, more wealthy.  In talking to a man that is a multi millionaire, asking him many questions about becoming wealthy he told me this : \"There is no secret to becoming rich, spend much less than you make and invest the rest into things that will make you more money.\" This makes sense. Look around you and you will notice that your average person is a hyper consumer and never invests in things that will put money back into his pocket.  Find ways to create multiple income streams and use the profits to expand and make more money.  Almost every successful person seems to have a different mindset when it comes to the things they buy vs the average person. Change your mind, change your lifestyle. ",

Now , people actually make mistakes and buy on liabilities as they think they are assets for example , brand new car .

Goverment handouts or charity and lottery / cash prizes, and if money does come from another source ie an inheritance, it initially stemmed from one of the above three. Yes you can win the lottery and win millions of dollars and if you do, good luck to you, but you're chances are slim but people do win. But the most realitic is working, earning that money and taking that money and making more with it. People who have money, have worked hard to get it. They're goal setters and like all succesful people theyre determined to reach their goals. I'm gonna buy a house then use the equity to buy another house. They know what they want to do and set about doing it, with all the inhrrited risks. In order to make money you have to be passionate, commited and make sacrifices. A sacrafice might be dedicating 3 / 4 years of your life to paying off the mortage and not doing anything but that, and people have done just that and have paid their mortage off by age 23 then use that spare income to travel the world or buy another house and make more money. Its just good old fashioned hard work, knowing what you want and going and getting it with hopefully a little luck along the way. Theres so many people who had very little and managed to create a small fortune for themselves through passion and determination and it can be done. It gets done all the time. Unfortunatley a lot of people arent willing to work hard, make sacrifices and take calculated risks in order to make money. ",

Then you have to define what 'rich' is for you, so you know when it is OK to ease off the throttle. When I was starting out, I thought $2M was 'rich'. Then I had kids, so I upped it to $3M thinking I would subsidize their education and leave them a small inheritance. Now I want to do things like support charities, help a few destitute families I know, and help a relative with an expensive health problem. The more you want to do, the richer you have to be.

            "answer_text": "This is a loaded question. How quickly would you like to become wealthy? A good way to invest in a retirement account consistently over time. Choose one with low fees and diversify to get a good rate of return. Balance your portfolio annually. In 40 years you could be a multi-millionaire. If you\u2019d prefer a faster method of becoming wealthy (monetarily speaking, of course) look into generating more income while simultaneously driving down debt. The fewer liabilities you have, the more powerful your money is. Also, stop trading your hours for dollars. Research ways to make a residual income. This is money that you make on work you\u2019ve done in the past (like how Michael Jackson\u2019s estate made $75 million in 2017 with him being deceased). One way is again the investment portfolio as mentioned above, creating something like a book or album, starting an online business, or looking into my favorite way: network marketing. ",

It takes years of dedication, hard work,optimism, patience and plenty of failure along the way, to get rich. But yes there is an easy way to get rich, that is to put Power Of Compounding to work for you. Let me share a story with you. Long back, when the inventor of the chess showed the game to an Indian king, the king was so impressed by the new game, that he wanted to reward the inventor. At that time, the inventor replied, \u201cMy wishes are simple. I only wish for one grain of rice for the first square of the chessboard, two grains for the second square, four grains for the third square, eight for the fourth square and so on for all 64 squares.\u201d The inventor said, \u201cPlease double the number of grains in the next square compared to the earlier square.\u201d The king was amazed to hear that the investor had asked for such a small reward. He happily agreed to the inventor\u2019s request. However after a week, the king\u2019s treasurer informed him that the reward would add up to a huge number\u2014far greater than all the rice that could possibly be produced in many centuries! Do you know how much rice it would be when one reaches 64th square of the chessboard? As said earlier, in the first square of the chessboard there is only one grain. But when you come to the 64th square, it is 18 million trillion grains of rice. This is more than enough to cover the entire surface of the earth. Moral of the story Start investing earlyDon\u2019t touch the amount for a long timeDon\u2019t keep jumping from one investment to another",

            "answer_text": "Theoretically? Yeah sure. In practice? Nope. There are many factors which decide whether or not a person will get rich. First are the personality traits. Rich people tend to be highly intelligent and hardworking. They are willing to sacrifice other parts of their life while working two shifts a day to develop their business. They are highly ambitious and don\u2019t give up easily. They\u2019re able to handle stress and work under heavy load. Other factors can be place where they were born, their family status and just pure luck. A hardworking American, whose parents can support them and help them get the education they need will have much better chances of being rich than someone born and raised in poverty. Sometimes luck is all you need. By becoming online memes, many unintelligent and lazy people got rich. All it takes is to do something stupid, which many people will see and talk about. Then, you become stinking rich influencer. With all this being said, there is a very small amount of people who have what it takes to become rich. Majority of people aren\u2019t simply working hard enough to become rich or just don\u2019t care about the money. And they\u2019re not extremely lucky. ",

I don\u2019t recommend you put it on your resume as a strength, but applying some practical lazy thought to the workplace can be very helpful.

AND IT IS NOT TOUGH: Think about this India is growing at real rate of 7% and taking inflation into account, it is 11-12% in nominal terms. Looks a very meagre return if u calculate the monthly numbers. So for Rs. 1 lakh, u earn what seems to be a petty sum of Rs. 1000. Say u r somehow able to earn 2% nominal returns per month, which isn\u2019t a mammoth ask considering that it is just double of what the country is growing at, and which of course u need to better because not everybody can become rich. Lets do the math now: Rs. 10 lakh would convert to more than Rs. 124 crores over a 30 year time frame. And if u could manage 4% a month, u could achieve this feat in 15 years. Isn\u2019t that good enough for calling yourself rich? and IS IT REALLY TOUGH? The knack to learn over here is consistent returns. What we actually fail at is optimising our money. Our salaries lie idle in our bank accounts, we invest in assets that do nothing for us and most common issue of all, we do not know how to calculate our returns. WE FAIL TO REALISE THE POWER OF MONEY. Take this for an example: Most of us here earn approx. a lakh per month. Say we are able to somehow save the 10 lakh and invest it at 2%, it would become over a crore in the next 10 years. But instead of giving time to this aspect, we continue to concentrate on our jobs. Can we save this amount doing the same job over the next 10 years? Lets look at another example: A person in my office bought a flat (3BHK) in Pune for Rs. 48 lakhs+ Reg. Charges. He managed 18 lakh of his own and took a loan for the rest at 9.5% per year. Now I asked him a question: Would the flat be worth 4.8 crores in the next 10 years. The answer was NO. Now his 18 lakhs would have become 1.8 crores + the SIP of his EMI of Rs. 55k for 10 year tenure would have yielded him: 55000*488= 2.68 crores (at 2% per month). Now imagine how much he lost, but he was still unmoved, indifferent and most of all contend with his decision. So here u get the most important lesson: ACT NOW ",

We all are in rat race ( read Robert Kiyosaki) for being rich we need understand two words. Assets: Something that put money on my pocket. Liabilities: Something that take money from my pocket. We all need get assets for become rich. Look in google Gary Vaynerchuck and Grant Cardone. Save and invest in assets. Read Rich Dad Poor Dad from Robert Kiyosaki. You want start making money read Crush it from Gary Vaynerchuck and if you dont believe what he teach read Crushing It ( there are all the people who become rich after read Crush It) If you want become rich, start with change friends also atleast they want become rich too. If they are happy working 9 to 5 making rich other people leave them. Poverty is in your mind not your pocket. Im glad you ask this, happy to know that you want more than work in someone else dreams. All the best, the way is hard but worth it. ",

You can\u2019t be rich while behaving like poor.Ignore old school teachings like \u201cMoney does not grow on trees\u201d and stuff like that.Dream big enough to take your sleeps away.You are allowed to build a palace in up sky provided you have designed (or developed) a staircase to reach over there.Never give up! Giving up is wasting, you might never be able to build (or gather) courage to get up again.Don\u2019t mix loosing with failing. Failing will teach you something, but losing will take your courage from you!Prevent yourself from getting caught up with the negative aura. Keep negative people, thoughts, environment away. Let the only positive energies slip inside you!Master your skills. And genuinely try to achieve best in what you can do!If you believe in God, don\u2019t be extremist! Almighty has created this universe and entire humankind. Believe in humanity, equality and the hidden power of the universe.Don\u2019t feel inferior or superior to anybody. Even after success!Read lots and lots of books (biographies, stories of rich and successful people, success mantras, time management, communication, knowledge etc)\u2026One of the things I have been following since last many years is to learn at least one thing a day. You will have learned 365 new stuff by the end of the year. And you won\u2019t believe it. If possible log your learnings!Concentrate on health. If you are healthy, you are already wealthy. Remember \"Health is Wealth\"Finally, be helpful, thankful and generous.Hope this will help! Thanks ",

You will do this with a breeze as you love what you are doingMost tricky one. Just because you love your job, does not mean that it is real. It is just a job. Know the clear difference between real life and work. Make your decisions without emotions unlike you do in real life. Be an honest and good person, but be a professional. If you mix these 2 up, you will make somebody else richJust a remainder. Being rich has nothing to do with being happy. Money will make your life easier in the short run for sure, but just money will never ever make you happy alone Best of luck ",

Or, you could try as hard as you can studying, practicing what you love, no procrastination included, until you get a job with a decent salary (6 figures i.e.). You then will (hopefully) slowly grow over the years and put money in retirement and maybe invest until one day you retire and have all that add up to a decent amount. This is a normal persons life in my opinion. You are kinda stuck in a gap that won\u2019t get you \u201crich\u201d but, keeps your living decent as long as you don\u2019t blow all your money on bullshit that could drive you broke. If you really want to make money, you want to push yourself as hard as you can, pushing your limits, everyday, from the start of high school, and college, to the finish of it all. Then after that, you push even harder. Studying as hard as you can, staying up that extra hour studying something for your test, that is in a few days. No knowledge is every lost, no matter how much you think that something is pointless.Working hard your whole life will not only increase your chances of being very successful financially, but could get you \u201crich\u201d.

Nobody respects evildoers.Everyone respects people who innovate, work hard, develop a valuable set of skills and work in favor of the whole society.it\u2019s amazing how much smarter everyone thinks you are once you have money. While it is possible to make a lot of money while working for someone else, the truth is that you should mind your own business.The miracle of life is that it doesn't matter so much where you are, it matters where you are going.The last step resides in the concept of contribution. Even if you have no money, find a way to contribute to others. Look for opportunities where you can help those around you. So it isn't about getting rich for a large degree of people, but rather, finding a way to earn just a little bit more money without all the added time it might take!!! :) ",

            "answer_text": "Being rich and being wealthy are two different things. Being rich is simply having a lot of expendable money. Typically, these are people with fancy cars, living in a fancy house, wearing fancy clothes. Rich people have usually come into their money in a short time period (think lottery winner, or entertainer). In contrast, being wealthy is someone with sustainable wealth. Wealthy people know how to make money over a long period of time and have the knowledge to keep it. Also, wealthy people are far less likely to needlessly spend on the latest gadgets for instance, they keep close track of their income and expenditure. So, essentially, a wealthy person will always be wealthy, but someone who is rich usually spends excessive money until it is all gone. How many lottery-winners have become bankrupt after only a few years? Although most people in developed countries have the opportunity to become wealthy, very few actually use that opportunity. Being wealthy is about having complete control over your income and expenditure, and foregoing having the latest gadgets or buying things to show-off. Wealthy people actually tend to be more frugal in their spending (even Bill Gates is reported to have been seen shopping at Walmart and Target!) To summarize, to become wealthy, all you have to do is have total control over your personal finances and to be patient. Don\u2019t believe the many \u201cget rich quick\u201d schemes which are advertised, and instead concentrate on ruthlessly saving/investing your money. To become rich simply buy a lottery ticket, cross your fingers and hope for the best! Unless you are one of the very lucky few, coming into a significant amount of money in a short period of time is not something which you can plan for. ",

Learn languages.Invest 30 % in assets which can produce income for you in the future: Property you can rent out, stocks in profitable companies, etc.So the first rule is to spend less than you earn and invest in assets. The second rule is: Never borrow money. Debt is a liability that prevents you from investing. The third rule is to invite a person in a higher position than you for lunch. Do this once a month. Rule four: Have a small book where you have names and contact information for all people you meet. Send them greetings for birthdays and new year. One day will one of them open a door of opportunity.

Pay attention in class, and expand upon your learning by researching additional facts. Hard work always pays off ~ metaphorically and literally. 3. Practise speaking. This may seem a little odd to you at first, but it is true that a good speaker is a good earner. Read more, and practise speaking infront of people. As you do this you will notice that you are able to give much better presentations and speeches. Think of the jobs that require good skills in speaking: Lawyer,Doctor,Politician,CEOOn average, these jobs earn an average salary of $100,000+ (\u00a380,000+). Think of the jobs that don't require skills in speaking: Electrician,Mechanic,Waiter / Bartender,Cleaner.On average, these jobs earn a yearly salary of $27,000 (\u00a323,000). See the pattern?

How many dollars, kunas, dongs, yen, or pounds sterling do you have in your bank account? Wealth is (in practice) what you can do with that currency. What utility does it bring to you. Does a \u201cwealthy\u201d person really live that much better than an average shmoe? Does that 10,000 square foot McMansion really provide that much more use to them than a modest 2,000 square foot house? Having a new luxury car every three years does what exactly compared to keeping your car for 10, 15, or 30 years? They both get you to and from work, errands, and events just fine. The lights go on, and the water coming out of the tap is drinkable. The internet goes to the same places, and netflix does not care what your net worth is. So, in practice, are the rich, mega rich, or so-called wealthy really that much wealthier than the average person? And, that is the key, right there. As soon as you realize that the expensive stuff is no better than the average stuff, you will stop spending your money on stuff you do not need, and start saving and investing. It will end up being a habit, and when you do have a net worth of several million, you will not only be wealthy, you will also be rich. ",

You do these things, and watch how it pays off: Get up early in the morning, no later than 6am and start work.Write down personal and career goals. Read them every work day.Schedule your day in time blocks on your calendar ensuring tasks to help you reach your goal are scheduled in those time blocks.Read non-fiction books about money, finance, time management, and self improvement.Exercise at least 3 days a week. A healthy body is a motivated and working body.I do all of these things, and more, and feel I have been very successful. One other thing to keep in mind is that you can be rich by having more than you need or needing less than you have. Think on that a bit and see if you can change your desires and values and watch how rich your life becomes. Good luck!!! Chaz 5and2Guy.com ",

            "answer_text": "First to become rich one should understand that there are no short cuts. To become rich one should be lot disciplined in fiance and should value the worth of every paise. What one should not Do: Just working alone wont make you rich.Do not invest in assets like residential properties; the investment on residential property is liability as it requires lot of money for maintenance. So avoid which does not yield you any income.Do not take personal loans to buy properties or for any investments. Remember these loans are very costly, one needs to shell 18% to 24% as interest which means for every 100Rs you are spending Rs1.5 to rs2.4 for for per annum 18Rs to 24Rs which is huge. So if you are going to invest then you returns should be 25% to 35% profitable which is highly impossible.What one Should Do: Be humbleTreat people well.Know how and where to invest money.Find the things that makes you happy.Surround yourself with right people.Never become Complacent.Appreciate experiences over items.Be frugal - Understand how you spend your money. The people who have achieved and sustained wealth do this very well. They do not buy things that they do not need.Manage your ego, this is most important of all. This ego can be extremely detrimental. Because believing that you are better than others will cause you to act differently. You might be less inclined to meet new people or less open to others' ideas. Therefore, finding ways to remove ego from your life will help you achieve success while continuing to grow and learn from those around you.Without my parent support, i am proud to say that my net worth is valued in few crores and pay income tax as few lakhs every year. All these happened in a span of 10years. What i did to achieve this is below: Till i had a cash of Rs.1 Crore on hand, i did not buy an own house. The day i hit 1 Crore i searched for house which will yield me good income even though if i am not residing there. Result searched for an year and bought a house worth 60Lakhs in an IT hub, Bangalore.I invested 50% of the house cost as down payment and another 50% as bank loan so that i can save something on Incometax. Also on the remaining money i can invest on other things.Right now i reside in the house i bought, if i leave the house for rent now it will yield 30k/month; which means on an investment of 30Lakh i get income of Rs.3,0,000/- if left on rent, which is like 12% earning for the investment. Loan vs income i profit 3%. To become rich every % of profit matters. What i ensured here is \u201cCareful approach on taking debt. If you take on debt personally, make sure it is small. If you take on large debt, make sure someone else is paying for it.\u201dDid not just dependent on Salary; Invested time in aqua culture, brought pond for 2.5 acre started doing fish cultivation. This gave some additional income.All the extra money earned out of FD and additional income where invested in stock market. Which means always the capital is saved and only the additional money where invested. I had my good friend circle from whom i used to get tips did my own research and started to reap benefits by investing. Remember i used the word Investment nor trading so be careful.For to do above activities you need lots of time and how did i got those time on earth? Its very simple. I never watch Televisions believe me its one of the worse time killer, the moment you quit that you will have lots of time for you to invest on for making money. Remember \u201cExcuses cost a time and that\u2019s why the poor could afford a lot of it.\u201dSo People who say \u2018I want to be rich\u2019. The question is, \u2018Are you willing to do what it takes?\u2019 religiously follow the golden rules to become rich. ",

From where you will going to arrange money, whether it is via angel investors or bank loan or by any means and for doing business you must have the sales skills it's a must known skills for every business person. The best industry to start in in my opinion is education industry Bcoz this industry will make you earn fortune and respect as well.such as Tai Lopez(60Million),Dan Lok(86Million),Grant Cardone (300Million). They all make millions only by selling courses online and you can also turn your knowledge into profits. 2 industry is brokerage industry it doesn't require any office or team members just you and your intelligence and some amount of money to generate leads,and the one I loved the most is real estate broker bcoz real estate industry is a billion dollars industry and the product of real estates are worth crores (millions) and the brokerage you will going to earn is also huge.

Set aside money for savings first and then dive into the expenses of day to day living. Even a small amount saved each week / pay cheque will set you on the path. Of course, you can lie, cheat, steal and use under-handed methods to accumulate wealth but there are always costs: people will target you for the money you have. Thieves will break into your home despite the best security system imaginable. Business associates / competitors will scam you. I will use the acronym TANSTAAFL - There Ain\u2019t No Such Thing As A Free Lunch! Making money means working long, hard hours and being frugal. That or work hard and then patent a new process that is used by others who pay you royalties. I know of one gentleman who races automobiles: every car on the road today has four components that he created and patented. He is wealthy because he was creative and invested time and effort in researching, doing creative thinking and so on. If you desire wealth, then embark on the path towards wealth. Read what the wealthy people write - a library is your best starting point. ",

            "answer_text": "All I am about to write comes from the book rich dad poor dad. So I\u2019d recomend you to read books of Robert Kiyosaki first..but anyways\u2026 I\u2019ll try my best to put it all in my words. First of all think of your money as water filled in a water tank which has a inlet(your income) and a outlet (you spending your money)  There are 3 possible cases you can be in Your out-flow is bigger than your in-flow . Which means you will never have enough money and might already be in debtYour out- flow is as big as your in-flow. Which means you will have all your needs fulfilled but wont have money for any new plans.Your in- flow is bigger than your outlet. You will be having some money left at the end of the day.Now the most important thing that needs to be cleared is, how you define \u2018rich\u2019. Being rich does not means having a big inlet but it is about how many days you will survive whwn the in-flow is closed. In other words it depends on how much water you fill in your tank. As you can see, it is physicaly impossible to fill the tank in first 2 cases mensioned above. Which means the only way that you can become rich is by being in the 3rd case. Now the mistake that most of us people make is, we think that if the inlet of our tank is big enough, we would become rich. But you see, the tank will never be filled with water unless the out-flow is smaller than the in-flow. What I mean is, it doesn\u2019t matters how much you earn per month if the money you spend is more than or equal to what you earn. So the first thing you need to do is, minimise your expences 1.Reduce the outlet i.e. reduce your expencess to the minimum. Now to the second step\u2026 Now if you look at the way how it works, if the out flow becomes small enough then the tank will start to fill and you will eventualy become rich. But it is a way long process. Thats why the 2nd step is necessary. 2nd step is to increase the number of inlets and/or incease the size of pre-existing inlet . This can be done by either geting a high payed job or by generating a new source of income As it comes down to types of income, there are 2 ways in which you can earn money . \u25cfActive income \u25cf Passive income Active income can be earned in terms of wages, saleries, or by self employed income. (Please google the terms active and passive income for more info. ) But it is quiet difficult to have more than one active income source as you can not work for number of jobs at the same time ( it beccomes exausting and stressful). So the another option you have is passive income . Passive income is the way to earn money again and again for something you did for only once in the past. Ex. You upload a sucessful youtube vedio. Now you will get money every time someone views your video and you dont have to do anything again once you have uploaded the video. Once you have multiple sources of passive income your tank will start filling even faster. 2 . Produce more ways of passive income. The 3rd step revolves around the concept of the water tank. It is investing in assets rather than buying liablities..(google assets and liablities too) An Asset is something that you buy once and that thing earns money for you. Consider that you installed a rain-water harvesting system for your tank. Now the system itself will help filling your tank. Now all you need is some maintanence. A liablity is something that you buy once and it requires more money to sustain\u2026its as if you make a hole at the bottom of the tank. Ex. A car which you give on rent is a asset as it brings you more money (tough money for maintanence will still be required) A car which you use for personal transport is a liablity as it wont bring any money to you but still require money for maintanence and fueling Note: it doesn\u2019t matters if the car helps you save your energy and time (time is not money when it comes to defining an asset ). A object is asset only and only if it brings money to y Read more about these terms.. Assets and liablityPassive incomeInvestment statergiesI belive these things will help you. Best luck on your way to financial freedom.. Please Do read the books of Robert Kiyosaki ",

            "answer_text": "In order to be rich, you need to be financially literate. This simply means you need to know the difference between an asset and a liability and how to use your money the right way so that you can generate more income. You need focus on acquiring assets and keeping liabilities low. The more assets you acquire, the more financially independent you will become. Examples of assets are: stocks, bonds, and real estate. Once you invest in an asset, your money will begin working for you. For example, if you invest some money into stocks, you will eventually earn more money without doing any work after you invest. Liabilities are things you buy that don\u2019t generate income after you buy them. Such as: your car, cellphone, or house. Don\u2019t get me wrong, you need liabilities in order to survive. However, you don\u2019t need expensive things such as a big house or a cool car when you can\u2019t afford one. Instead, try to save at least 20 percent of your paycheck so you can invest in assets later on. If you want to learn more about how to be financially literate and how to understand money differently, read \u201cRich Dad, Poor Dad\u201d written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. Good luck.

The various stock market crashes should teach you gambling is very, very dangerous. The only way to truly become rich is and stay rich is through hard and steady work. I know that sounds cheesy but its true. As any programmer or ecologist will tell you the most complicated systems are the easiest to fail. However if you merely dedicate yourself to secure jobs and gain experience/connections your opportunities will open up. Then invest that money in the bank and have your funds grow exponentially through interest. Plus never take loans or debts, as they too can grow exponentially, and severely impact your income. If you have no obligations you are incredibly flexible on any future misfortunes. ",

Think of it as something you want to collect - because you really care for it - unlike everybody else who wants to get rid of it. Don't be driven by greed but be driven by love knowing that money will be happier with you than anyone else. When you get money - think of how you can use it to get more money. (This is called investing.) Read anything and everything you can about Warren Buffet. No one loves or understands money better than he does. If you make it a point to save or invest 10 percent of everything you earn - you will have more money than most people in 10 years. You might die a rich, lonely miser (read about Hattie Green) but you will have money - and that's all that matters - if that's all that matters to you. ",

Part of being successful in anything in life is knowing there will be good times and bad. In the good times we should enjoy it and be proud of our work, time and effort. Where as in the bad we should not take it personal but look at it as a learning time, a chance to see what did or didn\u2019t we do rite. If we can learn from it we can grow from it and the next time things go sour we can hopefully over come using our previous lessons in life. ",

It's very important to read on other rich/wealthy people and learn from their ways. A lot of people will sit there and tell you to invest in stocks, save on your 401k, etc. But the best thing to do is to start your own business- anything related to selling something and learn how to sell the shit out of it!  Literally.  Sell, sell, sell until you consider yourself wealthy. Don't know what to sell? Look into things that interest you- Real Estate, Online Marketing, Affiliate Marketing, Ebooks, Etc.

From Sri Mukesh Ambani to you, all of us have a fixed time for one day that is 24 hours.. No one can stretch it long. So it is very very important how do we use our time? If you use your time through productive way then it will give better results in future. If not then you better know that from me. So you better know how do you use your time\u201d the god gifted most valuable matter in earth equally given to all\u201d. Okey many of us do hard work using our time, but there is no fruitful result at all. How does hard work give the best result for you? Here come laws of physics. The definition is work in physics roughly is \u201c Work= Force*Displacement\u201d. Take an example. There is a big stone, you have to displace that. So you start to push that. You work very very hard. But after a few days, the stone doesn't displace. Now as per the definition of physics work is zero though you have done a hard work. As there is no displacement of stone. So despite your hard work, your output is equal to zero. Most of us use our hard work in this way. So most of the case our output is nearly equal to zero. Second option. Take a chisel and a hammer. Put the chisel on the stone and bit hard with a hammer. Within a few days, the stone becomes small pieces of stone. Now you can easily displace them. Here also you have to do hard work but in a different way. Here your output is 100%. So try to choose always the second way. Most of us think that those who are successful in life are more brain capacity than us. But we have almost similar brain capacity except some genius personal. But we don't use brain capacity properly. Most of us don't even try to think a matter in a new way. The negative attitude is becoming an obstruction in front of us. Let think we have to reach from place to another place. The way of second place is unknown to us. Her we start to think about what may be the short way to reach that place. And found the short easy way. But its time to think about a little big matter such as how can we change our life, we stop thinking. So start thinking. It will energise your brain. I am sure if you start from today then you will be rich in tomorrow from today. And it is a continuous process. Thanks for reading a common man's answer. ",

Well frnd, let me tell u, all of the above can be used to tell tat I am rich, no one is born poor on this land, its people who judge you whether u r rich or not by the materialistic things that you own.  People who dont have all that you think makes a person rich doesn't always mean they aren't rich. They are rich by the values they carry, they might be more honest than you, or they might be more hard worker than you, they might be culturally rich than you.  So now decide in what way you want to be rich. Dont be rich to people. Be rich and true to yourself.  I don't deny tat materialistic richness is not needed, but dont forget to be rich in all the other things tat makes u rich in urself while you are on the path to get a ferrari or a penthouse in washington. Good luck. ",

There will be room for plenty of margin. They will eventually buy you out to preserve their monopoly and margins. Alternatively start a trademark brand. For $200 you can register a brand at the trademark office giving you a monopoly on that name. Now simply advertise as a high quality high priced brand of a common thing and you will have high margins. Your econ 101 teacher was wrong. Consumers prefer higher priced goods. Try beer, clothes, ice cream, watches, snacks, diet bars, vitamins, t-shirts, car accessories, etc. Use third party manufacturers to produce or pick an item you can make at home without much regulation.

Actress Jessica Alba built a $1 Billion dollar company based simply on the name \u201cThe Honest Company\u201d. Brands are POWERFUL and cheap. A trademark gives you a legal and ethical monopoly that government police will enforce for you with seizures of counterfeit goods for simply $200. It's astoundingly powerful ",

Not surprisingly, successful ones are those who spend on learning, exploring and skill development. Ask any wealthy investor, they will say that money makes money. Intitially, learning and skill developement is more than money. To spend time and money on learning important skills early on in life will help you earn millions more with time. Investors and rich people think about long term gains. They are not myopic. So to become rich, spend on learning first. LEARN first, then remove the L from it. EARNing will follow LEARNING. ",

It is inherited (this is one the best ways to get wealthy, especially if you can avoid paying taxes on the inherited wealth).It is made by creating something of value, such as a piece of software (Bill Gates), a business, a product, a patent, etc.Some people are able to accumulate real wealth by working for other people, but that\u2019s rare. And in every case this wealth is increased by using it to invest in other assets\u2014new business, the stock market, real estate, etc. Of course, it helps to save more than you make and to put that savings into investments, but that alone is unlikely to make you wealthy. But it depends on what you define as being wealthy\u2026. ",

You can define \u201crich\u201d in different ways. There are a lot of people who simply consider it as having a lot of money. For them, rich is equivalent to a being a millionaire. But rich can also be psychological richness. It is an achievement of being able to live without the worry of money. You don\u2019t necessarily need to own a castle to be considered rich. Everyone can be rich as long as we are able to do what we desire freely and to have the fulfilment in life. The key of it is to live with or even less than what you have. To be \u201cnormal\u201d even when you are financially capable to do a lot more. You might have your own preference on which definition suits you better.   PEACE IMAGE SOURCE - INTERNET ",

Get married into a wealthy family. 3. Make it on your own which majority of people on the planet will fail to do. If you happened to be on #3 like myself, you will have to plan all your welfares by selling your professional services, be smart about saving for future, and earn money on your own. Anyone who cannot make it under that system will be homeless just like millions of other on the planet. ",

            "answer_text": "Since you did not define Rich as a dollar amount I\u2019ll go with the long held belief that one million dollars US is rich. Here is a snip-it from Dave Ramsey. I will link you to the full article. If you start putting away $300 a month beginning at age 25, you could reach millionaire status by age 60\u2014and be sitting pretty on a $2 million nest egg come retirement (age 67). That\u2019s just $300 a month! If you waited until age 35 to start investing, you\u2019d have to put away $800 a month to hit the million-dollar mark by age 60. Let\u2019s look at it a different way. If you invested $300 a month for 40 years (age 25 to age 65), you could have $1.75 million. If you invested that $300 a month for 30 years instead (age 35 to age 65), you\u2019d only have $651,400. You\u2019d have to work an extra 10 years (to age 70) to hit $1 million. And you\u2019d have to work until age 75 to hit $1.75 million. Do you want to wait until you\u2019re 75 to become a millionaire? Me neither. ",

And even better, you\u2019ll stay rich because there is really no place to spend it while in jail.I am one step away from being rich, all I need now is money - Mr. Lazy ",

You can become rich by doing so many things under the sun that cannot be fit into one answer and everybody knows this. This just popped up because Naresh Chittatur asked me to answer this. Frankly, if whoever asked this question had asked a mature sensible question about a specific way of getting rich, then I\u2019m sure there would not be more than 9 followers. But here, there are 900+. Astonishing! Anyways, I will give a very vague answer, here it goes: Work 10 hours a day, 6 days a week.Pay less taxes.Save more, spend less.Don\u2019t gamble. If you gamble and win, don\u2019t spend the winnings.Happy? ",

Your reason can be something else too but in most cases ( as per my observation) these three reason pops up . It highly depends upon the individual and their circumstances . If you know what you're good at along with that you accept your circumstances and choose to go beyond it you'll find a way . But you must constantly remind yourself that giving up is not an option But just don't live to earn money . Money is a necessity if it is earned more than enough it might be something you'll terribly despise in the later part of your life ",

Suppose you're 25, fresh with a job, high hopes and goals for the future. You get a decent salary of around 60k Rs. Per month. You manage to save around 15k every month and you invest it.Let's assume that the rate of interest is around 15% (Any decent investment is bound to give you somewhere around the same).Let's say you save up 15k every month for 10 years which amounts to Rs. 18 lakh without interest would end up amounting to Rs. 41,79,895 (Rounding off to Rs. 42 lakh)A profit of Rs 24 Lakhs.If you never save any money and just keep investing the money you gained as profit in these 10 years till the time you turn 60 (25 more years), you end up with a sweet amount of Rs. 7,90,05,486 (That's 7 cores, 90 Lakhs, 5 thousand and four eighty six).2. Suppose you believe to enjoy every single penny you have in your 20s and decide to start saving when you turn 35 till the time you retire on 60. You would have invested Rs. 45 Lakhs and end up making Rs. 4,92,61,106 ( That's 4 crores, 92 Lakhs, 61 thousand, hundred and six) and that's just excluding the amount invested.So be smart. Start saving early. Compound Interest rocks. ",

And learn through physical and digital mentorships.  7 start a business or buy an existing business. Easy to learn with a good mentor.  8 invest in real estate. again learn this from a mentor  9 If you repeat these steps and slowly accumulate assets for 20 years successfully you will achieve financial freedom.  10 Now you can lay below a palm tree in paradise with your dream home and dream wife and live off of your real estate and business assets. 11 looking at all of these steps I can soundly say that I myself wil never become wealthy since I am not even capable of rising early. It is super hard and it takes 20 to 30 years it not surprising that only 10% of the world population are wealthy vs the rest. ",

            "answer_text": "Becoming rich is all about compounding your money faster than the inflation. Stock market is the best place to compound your money. The idea of investing is to compound the wealth over a period of time. Compound interest is an exponential function. The outcome is exponential. Rs 1 at 25% per annum for 10 years become Rs 10. If you compound again for the next 10 years, it becomes Rs 10 x 10 = Rs 100. Let that sink in for a second. Now that Rs 100 compounded for next 10 years will become Rs 1000. So in 30 years you can grow 1000 times if you compound your money at 25% per annum. Just imagine if you compound for ten more years. You will make it 10000 times. If you start at the age of 25. At 65 you can grow your investment 10000 times. This was all about compounding money at 25% and this is how people become rich.  The great Albert Einstein once said \u201cCompound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it \u2026 he who doesn't \u2026 pays it. My advice is to start saving money early in life and invest it in the stock market via mutual funds. Reason why you should start saving early. Let me give you one example. Ben and Arthur were friends who grew up together. They both knew they needed to start thinking about the future. At age 19, Ben decided to invest $2,000 every year for eight years. He picked investment funds that averaged a 12% interest rate. Then, at age 26, Ben stopped putting money into his investments. So he put a total of $16,000 into his investment funds. Now Arthur didn\u2019t start investing until age 27. Just like Ben, he put $2,000 into his investment funds every year until he turned 65. He got the same 12% interest rate as Ben, but he invested for 31 more years than Ben did. So Arthur invested a total of $78,000 over 39 years.  Believe it or not, Ben came out ahead . . . $700,000 ahead! Arthur had a total of $1,532,166 while Ben had a total of $2,288,996. How did he do it? Starting early is the key. He put in less money but started eight years earlier. That\u2019s compound interest for you! It turns $16,000 into almost $2.3 million! Since Ben invested earlier, the interest kicked in sooner. When both Ben and Arthur turned 65, they decided to compare their investment accounts. Who do you think had more? Ben, with his total of $16,000 invested over eight years, or Arthur, who invested $78,000 over 39 years? This is why we should start saving money very early in our life.

Sounds funny right But if you want to become rich never believe on going to job,just be an entrepreneur work for yourself have more profits and be ready to face the losses. When you go for a job you won't be getting the full extract of payment what a company or firm earns,but if you are a entrepreneur you just pay the salary amount to the one who works for you and the rest what ever the amount may be it is yours. Second thing to become rich is always try to earn from investments..investors are those who earn a lot where they are relieved from much taxes . Third one is that being Careful about the money that you spend\u2026..Savings could not make you much rich richer but it will prevent you from becoming poor. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. There are many ways to accumulate wealth. The path for me is investing in the stock market. I work the most hours my employer will offer. I then do everything in my power to keep my living expenses low. I buy used cars and drive them until they have to be junked. I buy my clothing at a second hand store. I use coupons to buy my food. All monies left except a rainy day fund I invest in a tax deferred account. I also spend a minimum of ten hours a week studying potential companies to invest in. If you choose to go this route I highly recommend reading Security analysis by Graham and Dodd. Also the Intelligent investor. Also by Graham. These two books will give you a basic education on investing. If you choose to read them feel free to ask me about any thing you find confusing. ",

If there was a way of easy money then that would had been the way every one would had earned and if there was a well kept secret method to become rich then no one will tell you on quora not atleast for free or even for few thousand euros. If you want to get rich then work with no intention of gaining money. People who work to earn money are all around you we know them by the name mediocre. For example white collars get yearly package. People from middle classes get monthly salary and labor get daily wages. Sooner you get money lesser it will be. It's said that if you work more then you earn then soon enough you will earn more than you work. So work for passion money will run after you. ",

            "answer_text": "I once asked my uncle, who retired at age 50, this question. He said, \u201cSandeep, there are 4 ways to get rich.\u201d I\u2019m going to share them with you. ONE: You are born rich You have heard how some people are born with a silver spoon. Certainly, being born rich is the easiest way to become rich. TWO: Marry someone rich I have observed relatives and friends become rich overnight simply by marrying someone rich. This is not necessarily easy since people are always going to bad mouth you. You need a thick skin, and the ability to look beyond your partner\u2019s wealth. Rich people, like anyone else, have dysfunctional families too. The wealth compounds the dysfunctionality, and money has been known to tear families apart. THREE: Get very lucky My uncle considered himself lucky and this is how he made his wealth. He bought a property at the right time and place. He told me that when he bought his first property - a house - he and his wife could not afford any furniture and they slept on the floor until they could afford a mattress. He expressed gratitude for being able to sell and buy a larger property several times, catching the property cycles at the right times. Four: work very, very,veryhard \u2026 Yes, hard work can make you rich, but you have to work very, very, very hard. My uncle also said, \u201cSandeep, your parents are not rich, so that's out for you. Your family background is also worst, your a poor ,middle class so you don't have that option. If you want to be rich, you must work very, very, very hard and get lucky.\u201d still working hard. Thank you Sandeep K\u2713 ",

The trick is to find out what the masses desire, then give it to them. The Mafia was successful at this not only with alcohol, but even with other things like garbage removal/disposal. You don't have to be exceedingly intelligent and create something like a PC. One guy observed that Americans have so much stuff, they need a place to put it outside their homes! Public Storage was born, simple storage facilities were built, and now that fellow is a billionaire. ",

Starting from true zero the first 20 years is a slow grind, but you save, save and then you save and invest, and invest and keep on investing. At the 20-year point your net worth will turn from linear to more exponential. But your question is: How do you get rich ? investing is one way. There's real estate - which I do also to complement investing The best way - if you're able - is to create your own company. Become an entrepreneur; you'll dedicate yourself to becoming financially independent, but you need to be a. apprentice first! Also, you will sacrifice your social life. You need to be mentally and physically tough Realize everything you do will probably have to be done twice - or more - to get it right. Those are the ways and the expectations in getting ahead Imo.

            "answer_text": "No, not really. In fact the wealthy keep telling everyone what they are doing and how they can get there, but few people listen. For example how many people live below their means? Look at the \u201cMillionaire Next Door\u201d (book) and you find that many wealthy are not out there buying expensive items. When they do they wait until it fits into their budget. The expensive cars and houses are often just owned by people with massive debt. The wealthy person does not buy those things, they put their money into income producing assets first. In other words they take as much of their income as they can, and use it to create an income. Here is a simplified example. Many people will simply buy a brand new car with a massive loan on it. The person with a more wealthy mindset would prefer to put that money into an investment, and keep putting that money into investments until that investment is putting out enough income that it pays for a car payment, and even then they would buy a used car, and let their income pay for it. As I said it\u2019s a little simplified, but basically whats going on. They budget their money to put as much as possible into investments, creating passive income that will come in if they work or not. The will actually avoid increasing their lifestyle until their passive income exceeds their expenses if they can. But some will increase their expenses, but at a slower rate than their passive income is growing. But then there is more to it. Many people figure out how to make money with little to nothing invested. Although that takes more work. For example there are people who find properties, get them under contract, then sell the contract to somebody else. (This is called wholesaling.) You need to be intelligent, patient, and do a lot of research. I\u2019m just giving the highlights here. ",

I m not rich but i am happy! I dont have an Iphone, i dont have a car but those things wouldnt make me happy, you really can not buy happiness! The system want to make you believe that you need to buy all sort of things to be happy but the system doesnt care for your happiness, it cares about money, profits.

I think it is in certain people\u2019s DNA and if you don\u2019t have that DNA then you would be so miserable doing what it takes to become rich you would not do it. Let me explain. Most people that become rich (not inherited wealth) are the type of people by nature don\u2019t spend a lot, save and invest. You might call those people cheapskates, but that is how they are. They invest wisely in stocks and real estate. You also get people who work 24/7 who start and grow a business for decades. They did not start the business because their goal was to become rich, they started it because that is what they wanted to do. If your only goal is to be rich you would crack after the 1st year. It is hard work. Take Elon Musk. He is already rich and could be on his yacht with bikini models. But no instead he is starting electric car companies, drilling holes in the ground (which I think is a waste of money) and creating spaceships to take us to mars. He is not doing this for the money, as he is already rich. You can not fake this kind of drive and determination. You have it or you don\u2019t. ",

Quora Partner Program and some other sites allow for this, although you did have to put in time to get started.Make investments up to the \u201cmatch\u201d in a company 401k, if you have it available.Form a business of some sort.Make HIGHLY AGGRESSIVE investments with some portion of your income. If you are not inheriting, I think this is your best shot. Sure, the low-cost index funds could get you to about a million on a lower salary, but I\u2019d still not call socking it away for all those years, then having that later \u201cwealth\u201d. It is also NOT developing yourself, it is just \u201cdumb money\u201d so..Which brings up this: have a decent budget for developing yourself, knowledge, and skills.I guess I tend to think that the wealthy, the TRULY wealthy either 1.) Inherited and built from there or 2.) have some sort of business or HIGHLY AGGRESSIVE/unorthodox investing methods that gets them there. And I\u2019m also the type of person to think that the \u201cmillionaire next door\u201d people do not have true wealth, since they give up so much for MANY years just to hit the lowest level. I also tend to think the same of the FIRE people, like they stop developing themselves and living\u2026 I think to be truly wealthy, you figure out a lifestyle that works, then develop self to become so abundant as to get there, as opposed to slashing everything and never enjoying the moment. But I suppose to each his own. :D I also do not agree with the people on here that say to max index funds and stuff.. I think that is the recipe for upper middle class, but to each his own? ;) ",

Hardwork, knowledge and execution are the others I can mention but in my experience, I know so many hardworking, knowledgeable people who hustle day in and day out to get wealthy but the ones who have made it have been at the right place, time andin the right stare of mind when the opportunity came knocking. Opportunity is unpredictable and the determining factor, otherwise if it was something like hardwork or knowledge then we would have a sure formula for how to get wealthy. Take an example of Steve Jobs or Bill Gates: there are so many people of their generation that had similar thought processes however, they were in the right country, had the right knowledge set that enabled them to benefit when the opportunity came around.

That doesn't mean that you have to be the only one doing that job. Being a plumber or electrician in many places means that you don't have competition. If you have a profession already it may be as simple as you need to relocate to a place where there is less competition. Just check out where people in your profession are making more money and move there. The average US stock grows 10% per year. If you can make as much as twice the amount of money that you need you can invest half of it. In less than ten years you'll then have as revenue from securities than what you need to live. The thing making it shorter at compounded interest but I'm not going to calculate how much shorter it becomes. It's enough that it's within 10 years. The condition of course is that you are able to work in a sufficiently free market economy and doesn't have disabilities that stops you from doing hard work. ",

I worked with a person his riding mower quit. So he bought a new one. His was 5 years old. He put it on his credit card. Interest to pay. A few weeks latter mine quit. I went out & bought a new one. Mine was about 12 years old but I had fixed it myself a few times. I paid cash. He blew up on hearing this. How can He pay cash when I had to use my card explosion.

I Dont advise keeping cash but you may keep some cryptocurrency. Then buy real estate, for one simple reason they is no more land then we already have and the population is going to be on increase, and I don't think all would love to stay in the palm, artificial land that is. Finally buy gold, no matter what new currency comes and increases it's worth or the world screams it is the only thing needed buy gold. ",

It takes hard work, it takes risk and it takes luck. Virtually every method of getting rich requires some risk and luck (except for the last three which are basically pure luck). Everyone from Zuckerberg to Gates to Buffet to Bezos not only had to work hard but they also had to be lucky. This is the secret to getting rich. Discipline/hard work/perseverance + being lucky (timing + opportunity) + taking risk ",

            "answer_text": "Here are a couple tips on approaching wealth at an early age. Invest in your teens/early in your life. Do this and your savings will grow exponentially.Stop buying the latest trends, you don't need the latest phone, newest car, or that newest drop from Louis Vuitton. Rich people tend to look poor and poor people try and look rich vice versa. (To an extent of course).Live below your means and be content with what you got. It's very important to stop comparing your life to others because this tends to create a lot of unwanted feelings.Pick a high paying job and grind that degree. If you want it bad enough it will happen. Schooling is an investment for YOU. Some people say do what makes you happy\u2026. That only works so far. If I pursued the job that makes me happy I wouldn't be able to do the things I want to do in life because it simply doesn't pay enough.Being in my early 20\u2019s and pursuing my finance degree my eyes have opened up tremendously. I look around at my friend's after highschool and most of them are on major debt because they wanted that new vehicle out of highschool, that new Supreme hoodie that costs $1200, or the newest iPhone that they just have to get every year. I'm laughed at because I drive a 1997 ford escort and use the same phone I have been for the last 5 years. I will be the only laughing once I retire at a ripe age of 40 (Well that's the goal). It's all about setting yourself up for success, I sure hope some of these help! ",

            "answer_text": "Any person whose expenditure is less than his income is a rich person. So, to become rich, one has to earn money. But just by earning no one becomes rich. One should be able to save the earnings. By saving money, you don\u2019t become rich because money by itself doesn\u2019t gain more money. Moreover inflation decreases the value of your savings. You have to invest your savings. Proper investment increases the value of the money over a period of time. Earn, save, invest is the mantra to become rich. Of course, there are some people who adopt unethical means to get money on their hands. They may end up with a lot of money or they may lose all including their freedom. It may be true that \u201cEvery fortune has a crime behind it\u201d. But,\u2026 The money which doesn\u2019t help you have a peaceful life is more a millstone around your neck than a means of happiness. Clean conscience is the softest pillow which enables you to have a great sleep when you go to bed at the end of the day. Earn, but earn ethically. ",

            "answer_text": "well i don\u2019t know whether there are any rules set for becoming rich,otherwise everyone would have been blindly following them. usually u may have heard people muttering about the word \u2018destiny\u2019 whenever they palaver about poverty and richness. Albiet , i don\u2019t believe in such things but i know somewhere at the corner of my heart that destiny matters. I recommend myself and everyone not to relate poverty,richness with destiny.i think i am getting philosophical \u2026 Speaking with integrity,in order to become rich or wealthy what matters most is how you optimize and value your time . i think this point is the crux of my answer. Majorly,it also depends how do you perform at turning points of your life or how have u performed at turning points of life. Now ,the question arises what are the turning points of life TURNING POINTS CAN BE DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE. For students,turning points can be 12th performace (marks which fetch them a good college or entrance performaces) For some,it could be marriage \u2026after getting a lifepartner ,some may be doing good in professional life or things may be turning good in their professional lives For some,it could be a divorce \u2026..after getting divorce ,that person life got balanced and starting focusing on his own career and welfare . Later ,he perfomed well and succeded. For some,it could be something other or something else Definition of Rich is different for different people. Some can find richness in how happily they are living,while Some can find richness in monetary terms, while a teenager can find richness in the collection of branded shoes which he/she possesses. ",

Then it became \"wow, these people are serious.\"  And now is more like \"what a dumbass...\"   So allow me to express the collective frustration of all Quorans (if there is such term) here, at the nature of your question.   Dumbf**kAnd now the answer: There is no such thing as \"get rich quick\" in the sense of being generally available, legal or sustainable.  There are short-term opportunities in the sense of being at the right place at the right time, but these are pure luck and dry up quick.  Believe me, if you find yourself in one, you'll notice it. So posting a question on Quora like yours sounds like, \"hey I am too lazy to get off my ass and do something with my life, so why don't I reach for the nearest keyboard and find out how to make money rain today.\" ",

Desperation makes people thrive under pressure, innovate and be better simply because they have no other choice. And thru the journey, they find what they are good at and start providing value to others. The key to becoming rich is to providing value to others. The more people you can provide value to, the more money you make. Value can be delivered many different ways, doesn\u2019t matter if you start a business or if you are a consultant or simply a blogger\u2026you can make money in any field. So if you want to become rich, step 1 is to figure out what skills you have and what value you can bring to others. Then use your passion and conviction to inspire others. ",

Pay off all of your debt and NEVER* go back into debt.Buy investments that have enough cash flow to pay your monthly living and recreation expenses.NEVER spend more money than you receive.BOOM! Rich you are. *Not all debt is bad. For example, you can buy an office building with a $10k/month mortgage that generates $12k/month income, which pays for itself and gives you a little extra to use for your car payment. This essentially makes your building and your car free. ",

So they took the safe way. Working everyday. For. The. Rest. Of. Their. Lives. So, don\u2019t be afraid to try. Make a new company. Follow your dreams. Sure, you\u2019ll need to work hard, it\u2019s all worth it. And even if you fail, at least you tried something exciting and new, and you have more experience, and maybe, just maybe, You might even be able to try again. All in All, it\u2019s better than doing the same thing over and over every year. Even if you end up doing a full time job, that gets you an average salary, like I said, at least you tried something new, and had a time of experience. ",

While I\u2019m no where close or the best person to answer this question, this remind me of one of Naval\u2019s tweets - How to Get Rich (without getting lucky) In short: You\u2019re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom.Pick an industry where you can play long term games with long term people.The Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven't figured this out yet.Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage.Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you.If you can't code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts.Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement.Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers.Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.You can read the entire post here - hope it helps! And if you aren\u2019t already, follow Naval now, cheers! ",

Just dream and dream, you will find yourself richer and richer. But in reality or practically you never get richer because you don\u2019t have practical mindset and you don\u2019t want to work, so no working means no money. Next thing is KARMA, do good but never expect good in return. Your work is your KARMA. So in reality you should work, atleast start a minimal job or try to come with ideas for a business, a business with minimal investment or 0 investment but be loyal to yourself and others. As Karma is watching you. If you cheat someone then you will definitely be paid but in a different way. So start working. Dreams never comes true until you don\u2019t work. Once you start working, dreams will come true\u2026Slowly but yes it will\u2026 ",

The answer is definitely not working, and anyone that has been working will tell you the same thing. Working takes too much time and you are limited to how much you can make. This is the Fastest and easiest way! In my experience it has been starting a business, and personally it has been the worst ride of my life but it has made me the most money. I started by selling Jewelry, and no, not knock off jewelry because no one will buy them. You won\u2019t make enough in margins unless you are pouring thousands into it. What I focused on is high class fine jewelry, especially Diamonds. The reason for that is unless you are trained in pricing and evaluating, you wouldn\u2019t know the cost, so the margins are endless. You are able to markup 100% without question. I made 72,000 dollars in 7 months with this method. Here is a detailed method to help you, First, Find good deals on either alibaba, or Ebay. Second, re-list on eBay or Mercari Third, when someone purchases, ship 1 day shipping to you, then ship to customer. Do this part time until you make enough to focus on other things. ",

            "answer_text": "One great way is through real estate investing which is what I\u2019m doing to begin building serious wealth. My favorite strategy is called house hacking in which you buy a multi-family real estate investment property and live in one of the units. Without going into too much detail, the major benefits of this strategy include living rent free, building home equity, and on top of that you will be receiving positive cash flow if you find a good deal. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions about the process. ",

            "answer_text": "To get up early in the morning before sunrise and brooming the house. This makes a person rich. There are codes that has to be followed diligently in order to become rich. These are two among them. These are seeds to be sowed for yielding richness. The other codes are - to clean the house three or four times in a day. The house has to be dot clean without any impurities. Cleanliness leads to godliness and wealthiness. The more the house is clean, the more the chunk of wealth is created. Following these steps will generate enormous wealth. After the incoming of wealth, do not waste it. Never waste a single penny, a morsel of food or a drop of water. Wastage evaporates money. Now it is said, wealth of a person remains down to three or four generations in his or her family, then it gets slowly vanished. This is due to unfollowing of the early waking up and the cleanliness guidelines. The rich people follow this guidelines with fervour and zeal in their houses, work and business places. They become indignant, if these are not followed. These are the codes of generating enormous wealth. If one code is not followed, a chunk of wealth is lost. So, generate wealth and sustain it down the ages. ",

So, How do RICH people become rich? Nope, the answer is not [only] by making more money. There are 4 more Secret-Ingredient in their recipe for creating wealth. MONEY is HONEY. It\u2019s not everything but it provides security for you and your family. Do you want more? All you need is patience to read till the end and also absorb what you\u2019ve read. I\u2019ll take a hypothetical situation that you earn $100 a month, even if you don\u2019t earn a cent or maybe earn 10x more than that. Number 1: Leveraging your MONEY We fail to do the most important thing after making money. What is it? To give ourselves. You always tend to pay your bills, rents, taxes first. And then, at last, you give yourself the leftover amount you have. BEEP BEEP wrong ingredient. If you have to spend $80 on everything for a month take out $40 and use it for yourself, invest it but wisely. Count it as money used on yourself instead of considering it as an asset, which it is. Why INVESTING? Because here your money will work for you when you\u2019re asleep. Now you\u2019ve $60 and your monthly expenses are $80 that is a money deficit of $20, so what do you do? Here, the next thing comes up. Number 2: Making more MONEY People need to force themselves to do something and something that is HARD? Rare chances of doing it at all. But what if your unpaid bills become your motivator? You\u2019re running out of time, next month you don\u2019t pay your internet bills you will be thrown back to the stone age. Whoa, Such a nightmare. So what do you do? You solve your financial problems, that\u2019ll make you smarter but financially.TO MAKE MORE MONEY\u2013 The most important thing to do is to look out for multiple sources of income. How will you do that? It depends from person to person, you\u2019ll figure it out because you\u2019re running out of time.A simple example: Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a teacher, you can teach at an institute, take multiple tuitions, start your online classes, etc. So what\u2019s next? Number 3: Protecting your MONEY You cannot be rich if all your money is taken by financial predators. Do taxes squeeze out all your money? No, Taxes are the expenses of living in a civilized society. If you want to protect your money, you need to keep a check on its outflow. If you cannot control your emotions, you cannot control your money. Warren Buffet Banks \u2013 Interest from cardsBroker \u2013 Good broker makes you rich, bad ones? Makes excuses.Departmental Credit card \u2013 The worst credit card you can ever own.And a PROTIP, You cannot buy insurance when you need it, do it before. Number 4: Budgeting your MONEY. People say \u2018Live below your means\u2019. Is it that simple? If you want to be rich, you need to expand your means. Increase your INCOME, re-prioritize your SPENDING HABITS. Here, making more money will take care of your budget. All you need to do is keeping a check on your CASHFLOW. Cash that is flowing out from your POCKET. Number 5: Improving your Financial Information. You live in an information age. Use this opportunity not only for your entertainment but also for your knowledge. Classify INFORMATION before taking steps. Facts v/s Opinion.Insane Solution: Things that are too good to be true.Risky Action- Investing anywhere without doing good research.Having a good accountant is always a bonus for people who want to be RICH. And the most important thing is making the best use of all the ingredients but TOGETHER. Because missing one single ingredient in your favourite dish can destroy the taste of your lunch. And this is how you can be rich too. SOURCE: Rich dad\u2019s Increase your Financial IQ. ",

The savings should get you more.Learn to make gold work for you. By this statement, I would like to convey that - make the treasure (your savings) work for you. Make it your slave.

For example lets take Mark Zuckerberg in times he created Facebook it is the need of the hour as the people started to move to farther places for the better opportunities and it was the time became too busy in even remembering their own birthdays and their beloved and where they started to talk only in the time of need. It was the time where he created a social network which the people to be intact and the because of people moving to farther places it kept people getting connected to similar minded people. Though he did not create the Facebook for that purpose but it survived and passed through the hour of need where he made money and became rich.

Rich people buy luxuries at the last while not-so-rich people try buying them at initial level and end up in a typical debt trap. Your focus should be on increasing revenue sources and scaling them up with time. When money makes money for you, you're actually rich as your expenses are covered by the upcoming sales. ",

Making large amount of money is a nonsignificant part of being rich. If you live rich you would catch all of the opportunities and do not waste your time on non important activities. Then your lifestyle would change you to be a real rich man. ",

If you have debts/loans on you, consider repaying them on a priority basis.

It also allows you to allocate adequate funds for expenses, savings and investments. Being aware of these can help you manage your funds better over a period of time. Have specific goals and tie your expenses and investments to them. This will also act as a plan and help you build your wealth faster and in an effective manner. ",

You can become a jewel thief, a drug dealer, you could run a Ponzi Scheme, lots of possibilities here. If, however, you are not criminally inclined these are probably not options for you either. Earn it. Invent something useful. Patent a process to improve something. Start a business. The possibilities here are limited only by your imagination and desire to work to make your ideas reality. The guy who created NetFlix, for example, found a better way to do movies and his idea worked and made him rich. ",

Being constructive in your thoughts helps u find new paths in life ,new ways in life to do a particular thing in a manner in which u are most comfortable in , some people like being physically active but some people don't it's all a matter of perspective but if work towards ur goal and are doing all your efforts in order to achieve it then my friend you are not lazy. Being rich can differ from person to person ,some people feel rich by having lots of knowledge , some people feel rich by having lots friends and a great social life, some people feel rich by comanding a lot respect and some people feel rich by acquiring a lot of wealth ( which most us feel) . But one thing is for sure if u want to be rich start working towards it , be clever , be patient and u will achieve ur goals . So to sum it up being lazy can make rich , just work towards it. ",

A lot of people do not want to invest in stocks as they find it very risky with containing a higher chance of losing their money. Investments such as mutual funds, index funds, SIP, etc. can earn you good profit and are the safest options in the share market. These concepts do not require you to formulate strategies for investing in specific stocks that are performing well. Basic knowledge of the stock market and a good broker to advise you is the way to start investing. Commodity trading has earned me a lot of profit but it does come with risks of its own. Share market is a pool of various methods to earn the most. I guess it depends on what suits you and at what kind of trading you are best. I have always preferred index funds for investment as they are tax efficient, passively managed with a broad diversification for investing your money. India has Nifty 50 and Sensex which has the best 50 and 30 companies respectively in the index that are performing well. There are other investment options as well that can give high profit, too. ",
