            "answer_text": "Why do they speak Romanian in the movie Borat? As Peter Clings said, it was cheaper and safer to film in Romania (but just in theory because things didn\u2019t go as they planned). They wanted to have a very bad looking place so they went to a Roma majority village, named Glod (the name of the village is an arhaism for \u201cmud\u201d). I\u2019m sure Sasha Cohen was offered the \u201cguest room\u201d but he refused because it didn\u2019t have the \u201cexpected\u201d look. I\u2019m sure the Romas there didn\u2019t understand the concept of \u201cfictitious mockumentary\u201d, misunderstandings can get ugly.  (There are 3 villages in Romania called Glod, the chosen one was the closest to Bucure\u0219ti and its international airport. The name has nothing to do with the Roma, only the one closest to Bucure\u0219ti has a Roma majority. And the name of the village has nothing to do with the roads/streets, there\u2019s actually an asphalt main road. The house that was chosen was on purpose the \u201cend of the village\u201d kind, as far as possible from the main road.) I\u2019ve heard that there were some problems with the Romas there, they were paid badly and asked to do stuff like to bring cows inside the house\u2026 I\u2019m sure a lot of recorded material fell out at the final cut, I\u2019ve seen the movie only once, but I remember that the people that were supposed to be the main character\u2019s family, were having a bad argument in Romanian actually with Sasha Cohen, not his character, it was totally out of \u201cscript\u201d and out of character except for Sasha Cohen, he kept the character. It turns out that he pi**ed them off so bad that it was not that safe anymore, you never know when a pi**ed off drunkard grabs an axe\u2026 Maybe that drunkard just barely went to school in the 1950-1960\u2019s and can never understand that the mockumentary is mocking stereotypes on all sides, he just got drunk because all he is feeling is being humiliated, the alcohol only enhances that feeling and the rest is just falling dominoes\u2026 I heard that there was a lawsuit about this and that it was dismissed in court. Anyway, I don\u2019t think Sasha Cohen wanted to record a snuff video in some Romanian village for Pink Floyd - \u201cCareful with that axe, Eugene\u201d, although it would have been interesting to see Sasha Cohen running in circles in a muddy courtyard making high pitched screams while not getting out of the character, the \u201cultimate\u201d actor test, the final hit vs. \u201cthe final hit\u201d\u2026 I\u2019m sure the movie didn\u2019t have its final name until they went to that village, I\u2019m sure the villagers thought he was mocking them so they started calling him names, one of those names being \u201cbor\u00e2t\u201d (meaning \u201cpuked\u201d which is a very nasty equivalent of \u201ca**hole\u201d and \u201cstuff\u201d like that, even nastier, and that is why there is an exclamation mark after the name on the movie poster). In order to give it an even more \u201csovieto-exotic\u201d look, \u201c\u00e2\u201d was changed with \u201c\u0414\u201d (which is actually \u201cD/d\u201d)\u2026 It was meant for the \u201cwestern\u201d viewer so it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s \u201c\u00e2\u201d or \u201cd\u201d, but it has to have the \u201csovieto-exotic\u201d look of \u201c\u0414\u201d which the \u201cwestern\u201d viewer stereotypically expects and then the character reads it as \u201cA\u201d because he is not used to pronounce \u201c\u00c2\u201d and neither the viewer, case closed. (For who is really curious, that vowel is this: Close central unrounded vowel - Wikipedia There is a sound sample there but it doesn\u2019t sound 100% how it\u2019s supposed to be, that sound sample sounds more like this Moo box - Wikipedia because it\u2019s out of the context of a word and I don\u2019t think the recorder knew Romanian, just general phonetics in theory\u2026) So it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s Romanian or if it\u2019s Kazakh, the producers just needed to have a certain look/sound to fit in the \u201csovieto-exotic\u201d stereotype of the \u201cwestern\u201d viewer\u2019s cultural perspective for as cheap as possible. (Maybe \u201ccultural\u201d and \u201cperspective\u201d should be also placed in quotation marks, idk, you get the point\u2026) Anyway\u2026, when you watch the movie \u201cBOR\u0414T!\u201d, you are actually watching the movie \u201cA**HOLE!\u201d or some similar name, go get popcorn! Good luck! EDIT: i remembered something\u2026 The main character is being asked by the \u201cfather\u201d (who doesn\u2019t ask as a character, that Roma is visibly in no character at all, he is not acting): \u201c\u021a\u2019-am f\u0103cut curat, \u00ee\u021b\u2019 place?\u201d (\u201cWe cleaned up, you like it?\u201d) The \u201cspace\u201d that was chosen as the main character\u2019s bedroom didn\u2019t have in the beginning the purpose of a bedroom, it was some sort of deposit room, one can see that it has a fresh paint with Copper(II) sulfate - Wikipedia, a bit diluted. He really got them angry by refusing the guest room and getting them to fake the deposit room as a bed room, it\u2019s seen as very disrespectful. ",
