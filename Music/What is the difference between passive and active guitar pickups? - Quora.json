            "answer_text": "For the most part, active pickups have pre-amplification circuits. Passive pickups rely are not fed by any power supply. The voltage they produce is very low, so they need amplification. A passive pickup has a limited range of tone control due to it nature. Active pickups have preamp circuits, fed by a power supply (one or two batteries, depending on the model), and allow the musician to a wider tone control. They also provide more output, providing a louder tone. They ALSO need amplification, but the end result is, you get a louder pickup. While the principle is the same in both (a coil wrapped around one or more magnetic cores), there are some active pickups using new materials which make them very different than the \u201cclassic\u201d ones. Why use an active pickup instead of an external preamp? For one thing, you have the controls at your fingertips, instead of depending on an external amp or pedal. Which one is better? Well, both and none. It all depends on the sound you\u2019re looking for. ",

            "answer_text": "I seen the question has been answered so I\u2019ll just add my two cents. I know a lot of people think of active pickups for heavy drive rock and metal styles. I\u2019ve played Strats with EMG SAs and active eq circuits that were capable of tons of sounds. As you would expect the higher output active pickups are capable of, especially running 18v instead of 9v as some do, will overdrive the front end of your amp much harder. The Strats and actually I also played a Nashville Telecaster with EMGs that was about the same setup, they are capable of beautiful clean tones as well. ",
