            "answer_text": "You can get a sound check next time. you have a gig. Come prepared with amplfication if natural acoustics is not loud enough. If you need a little more volume when you check, first try the bluegrass technique of playing with nothing bit a microphone. You can stlll preserve the natural acoustical sound with a microphone assuming you have good technicians at the sound board. If you prefer meither of these options, stay with your pickup and amplifier. The upside is that you cut down on the feedback possibility you get with microphones. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends. Acoustic bass guitars (ABGs) vary quite a bit with respect to the volume they can produce. I have an old Ernie Ball Earthwood bass from the 1970s that is pretty loud, followed by a Taylor AB-3, a Tacoma Thunderchief, and a Guild B-30. I can hold my own with an acoustic guitar or mandolin; a banjo tends to drown me out. I find mine are fine for playing in the living room unamplified, but playing live amplified gigs, I prefer to plug in if possible or mike it. ",
