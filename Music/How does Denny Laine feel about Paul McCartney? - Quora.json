            "answer_text": "I think there are very few nice people, let alone nice musicians who could survive long periods with Paul McCartney. McCartney has seen it all, done it all - and was already at the absolute peak of his stardom in his early 20s. It's not McCartneys fault, but being told you\u2019re a genius, and musical heavy hitters just swooning and being speechless to be in the same room with you - must do some pretty horrific things to your ego. I should think he has a little bit of the Trump about him - so he\u2019s got a pretty low threshold to criticism. So it always seems to be the case that McCartney is only able to turn off the \u2018I'm a star\u2019 personality (how royalty must feel I suppose) only around people who knew him before he was famous and are genuinely easy going nice guys. So Klaus Voormann - the Hamburg friend is like this, so is Denny Laine, so is Jeff Lynne, so is Steve Miller. So where others like Eric Clapton, George Harrison, and most of McCartneys former Wings bandmates could become irritated by him, and speak their minds about it - The Voormanns, Millers, Lynnes and Laines \u2018 seem to be just nice, gentle, easy going people. They don't seem to have much bad to say about anyone. I think Denny lasted as long as he did, because he was the right balance of \u2018musical respect\u2019, \u2018without fawning adoration\u2019, and \u2018sweet guy\u2019 to stay in McCartney\u2019s good books. Others like McCartneys current band mates, manage to stay the course - because they are utterly egoless, work professionals. They\u2019re the equivalent of hiring wedding photographers for your wedding - they do their job, stay out of the way. So Denny Lane is someone who spent as many years working with McCartney as Lennon. Yet he doesn't really have a bad word to say about him. ",

            "answer_text": "From everything I\u2019ve read, he\u2019s not a fan. Denny felt that as an integral part of Wings, he should have been compensated on a par with Paul. Let\u2019s see, on one hand you have the ex-Beatle who wrote \u201cYesterday\u201d and \u201cHey Jude\u201d and on the other, you have the lead singer and guitarist who sang \u201cGo Now!\u201d for The Moody Blues, which he didn\u2019t write. Paul once said that he could prove that Denny was paid over 1 million pounds for his time in Wings. If Denny thinks he was taken advantage of, he should have left earlier and started his successful solo career. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all bought his successful solo albums, right? Well\u2026maybe not so much. Denny is a person who thinks more of his talents, which, admittedly were considerable, than the music buying public did. Being able to do something is not the same thing as being able to make money at it. Denny should feel that his time in Wings gave him more fame than he ever got from his time in The Moody Blues. ",
