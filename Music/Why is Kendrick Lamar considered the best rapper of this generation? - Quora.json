            "answer_text": "Kendrick Lamar\u2019s discography through the 2010s is unparalleled. He holds two titans of the decade in good kid, m.A.A.d city and To Pimp A Butterfly. TPAB was so incredible that a collection of songs that failed to make the cut\u2014repackaged as Untitled Unmastered, was one of the heavyweights of its year. Section .80, his debut, has garnered classic status among rap elites. I think DAMN. will achieve similar reception with mainstream listeners in time. If his forthcoming record is anywhere near good, we are without question witnessing the birth of an-all time great, irrespective of genre.There has been no superior song, in imagination and passion in the 2010s as Lamar\u2019s \u201cSing About Me, I\u2019m Dying of Thirst\u201d or \u201cHow Much A Dollar Cost\u201d. They are two of the greatest songs ever conceived. Both masterfully written literary-level pieces.Other tracks by Lamar, though perhaps not total paragons of musicality, are thrilling and decade-defining rap songs. This includes \u201cm.A.A.d city,\u201d \u201cAlright,\u201d \u201cCartoons & Cereal\u201d and \u201cDNA.\u201d.Kendrick Lamar is the most skilled rapper of his generation.Kendrick Lamar is a highly skillful lyricist. Even his phone-ins are solid and would be considered highlights for some of his contemporaries. At his best, he is the best lyricist popular music has ever offered.Is their an artist in history who has been as warmly received in their time as Kendrick Lamar? He is the most critically acclaimed musician of the 21st century. Even by people who are not particularly fans of his, there is a general agreement that he is the most exciting thing in music in the last 5+ years. He is the first popular artist to win the Pulitzer Prize for Music. His music is studied in collegiate institutions and is praised by educators and academics. To Pimp A Butterfly is one of 4 albums archived in the Harvard Library. In the future, he will be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame while TPAB will be included in the National Recording Registry. He could very well win the Nobel Prize for Literature.Kendrick Lamar is the best artist of his generation. No such rapper previous can so comfortably lay such claim. ",

            "answer_text": "Listen to DAMN and then comeback and ask. Im not a fan of West coast but his stuff stuff transients all of hip hop And he's so talented. His flow, the production, the subject matter. He just crosses barriers and all of hip hop. I will be still listening to damn in ten years. Fact. And to think I got his first mixtape and didn't rate it. Then I came back once damn came out and it hooked me straight away. It's far better than his second and first. Though his first album has some true bangers on it. He also doesn't do bullshit like have face tattoos and have stupid punch lines. He's real and he doesn't ram it down your throat. He tells proper stories of real life. That is why I love him and especially damn so much. I've listened to it so many times and I can't still put it on and love it. Like all true classics. Kendrick Lamar is never the news for other than music. That is why he is truly amazing. Recently he did damn in reverse order and it made me love the album even more as you always get the tracks you miss at the end if your traveling on ever. Kendrick is already a hip hop legend. ",
