            "answer_text": "Yes and No. Metallica from the late 1980s gave thrash metal the ultimate stage. With the release of Kill Em All their fast paced, in-your-face style music grabbed everyone's attention and landed them their first major recognition in the metal scene. They were already something special and with the release of Master Of Puppets they burst onto record stores and made their way into people\u2019s music libraries, soon people who were used to seeing glamour bands like KISS , Scorpions , Wraithchild were given a dose of pure , relatively faster music and less on-stage glamour with the advent of the Big Four. From the Big Four (Metallica , Megadeth , Anthrax , Slayer) Metallica was certainly the most influential and crowd pleasing. They had a gift in the form of their bassist Cliff Burton whose influence was heavy on their earlier works. In my opinon Metallica\u2019s best years were 1986-1993, they showed immense songwriting talent in Master of Puppets , Fade to Black , Orion , Sanitarium etc. Their melodic touch to the \u201cthrashiness\u201d was beautifully placed and gave their songs an edge over the others. For example: Fight fire with fire , Battery , Fade to Black and constant use of melodic sections as seen in Master of Puppets as well. But what really elevated Metallica in my eyes was the album And Justice for All (AJFA), it showed more of their technical side with well thought out phrasing and intricate guitar work , one Song in particular \u201cTo live is to Die\u201d is what i consider their best instrumental and Metallica at its peak. One other thing that people dont seem to credit Metallica with is their lyrics. Their lyrical department has always been strong whether its related to political tension, self loathe, or social evils. The little paragraph towards the end of To Live is to Die is pure gold. Fast forward a few years and you have the instantly recognizable Black album with the most popular songs in Enter Sandman and Nothing else Matters. They nailed this one! Nothing else matters appealed to the non-metal crowd as well and Enter Sandman was granted a spot in the top most catchy riffs ever. The production on this album was spot on and gave them commercial success. After this they started to deteriorate though, Load/Reload were significantly inferior to their earlier works and St Anger developed a general hatred for that damn snare (a few good songs were also there!). By this time they got in over their heads, the fame got to them , they became sloppy and their mission to make music was replaced by money. Also not to forget the ill treatment of Jason and James\u2019s alcohol addiction and anger issues. They woke up again with a casual attempt at Death Magnetic and now with a seemingly sincere one at Hardwired. However now their music is ordinary at best when compared to the current metal scene, needless to say they are way past their prime. Metallica is overrated in terms of complex musical abilities and they lack innovation. They are definitely trash in the solo department. It seems like Hammet has forgotten how to play the guitar over the years and Metallica is now infamous for pentatonic Wah covered solos. In terms of Musical influence however , they deserve the praise they get. ",

            "answer_text": "Not wholly. Let me clarify this. Granted, my opinion means appley-squat in Main-stream metal mania, but here it is. Their more progressive stuff came naturally to them. It was driven by creative, youthful angst and a desire to \"kick ass\" and just make aggressive music. This led to outstanding pieces like \"Fade To Black\", \"Disposable Heroes\", \"Creeping Death\", \"Sanitarium\", \"Master of Puppets\". But then they began trying too hard. The stuff that everyone loves (...And Justice For All) is a little \"Emperor's New Clothes\"-esque. Yeah, there are some great riffs and a few nice little melodic jingles, but overall it's self-indulgent and nihilistic. Don't get me wrong, I love \"One\" as much as the next guy, but people give them credit in the wrong place. Then they went main-stream. And I loved it again. The Black album had some great songs on it. Sorry. Shoot me for blasphemy, but it's a fact. Enter Sandman is a visceral, memorable riff that stays with you. Everyone in the entire world knows that song. I mean, anyone who's had any form of electric music at their disposal since its release. Granted, they'd used the same three dominant, sequential notes years earlier; half-time on \"Call Of Cthulu\", but this time they got the phrasing right. To be so simple, yet so timeless and gutturally profound (wow, that's a bit grandiose sounding....) is an achievement. Then they just got lazy. They got complacent. They discovered the major chord and all went downhill. Their lives became about shopping on Rodeo Drive instead of headbanging in a Los Angeles garage. From this:  To this:  I'm not saying metal musicians need to be image conscious. Not at all. I'm just saying if you have to fake it to go on stage, maybe you're past your prime. ",
