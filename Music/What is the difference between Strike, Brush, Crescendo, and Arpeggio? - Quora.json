            "answer_text": "I'm thinking in piano terms, a strike is when you hit a note, the physical keyboard on the piano, quickly and distinctly. I'm not sure about a brush or what instrument it applies to. An arpeggio is a series of notes, again, I THINK in perhaps a series of notes like everybody in a C chord, but heading up the keyboard. A crescendo refers to sound starting of quiet and working up to LOUD. ",

            "answer_text": "Brushes are long notes to sticks where a long note or a roll is made by many short notes squeezed together. A crescendo is a way for composers to indicate that a passage of music should gradually increase in loudness over time or he opposite. An arpeggio is a type of broken chord, often seen to rise or fall in more than one octave. Strike, idk. ",
