            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a weird thing and I wish I had an explanation for it. You can hear a song, dislike it, click away, and after YouTube continually recommends it, you just start to like it. I guess it\u2019s just because the song is an aquired taste of sorts, it\u2019s a bit different - contrarily, when I find a song I like from an artist I like, it doesn\u2019t usually take much time for me to like it since I already like it. All of this is not to be confused with those \u2018Earworms\u2019, those annoying songs that you don\u2019lt like but they get stuck in your head. Nor is it about songs that you try and get yourself to like, and eventually you get yourself to believe that (don\u2019t do that, by the way). This is a kind of interesting topic and does raise some questions about what makes us like certain music. On the one hand, there\u2019s some music that we just like and some that we just don\u2019t. On the other, you can like songs by association, the song you had your first kiss to for example, and sometimes it can take many relistens before you start to like a song. So for me, it\u2019s not that easy to know if we like songs because of pure familiarity or other things. ",

            "answer_text": "Not my most favorite by a mile, but I find it hard to get out of my mind. Dani Calfornia by Chili Peppers. I\u2019m not a RHCP fan at all and barely know about them. Can\u2019t name another song they ever did. What little I\u2019d heard, I didn\u2019t much like. But I\u2019d heard the snippet of the chorus \u201cCalifornia, rest in peace\u201d back 10 years ago or whatever, and it kind of stuck with me. Just recently, I was surfing YouTube and came on a kind of live-studio version of it and heard the whole thing. Now it\u2019s quite annoyingly stuck in my head. I then went to listen to other RHCP songs, and as a band, I don\u2019t like them. But this one song is just sticky with me. I wish it would go away. So, I dislike the band but really like that one song. Maybe that counts.  Another, somewhat in the same way, is How Soon is Now by The Smiths. Another apparently popular band I\u2019d totally missed in the 80\u2019s, but I\u2019d heard snippets of that descending slide guitar glissando going down a half-step and reminding me of strange perceptions in days gone by I won\u2019t talk about . . . . Well, early this year I heard the whole song and kind of played it all the time for a few months. I won\u2019t say I didn\u2019t like it at first, but for some reason I didn\u2019t want to like it. It had to do with the guitar glissando. ",
