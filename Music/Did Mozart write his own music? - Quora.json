            "answer_text": "Yes of course, by all means. He was one of the the best composer world has ever known. He composed a musical piece or a song and wrote it himself. He was a child prodigy and started composing songs and performing at the age of 11 years. Please don\u2019t be mistaken for some of the modern pop singers of our generation who not just outsource the composing, but also the lyrics, even choreograph to dance around in the stage or in a video and music which they cannot even play themselves, but just give their beautiful voice and become famous. If your question was whether he mass produced those musical pieces, then printing press did it on his behalf. Printing press was invented even during those days, so yes it made his job easier to make multiple copies which he wrote with his own hand. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes \u2014 that is what a composer does! (Perhaps I don\u2019t understand the question correctly.) A few of Mozart\u2019s published works are actually Mozart\u2019s arrangements of music written by other people; the first few piano concertos, for example, written when Mozart was a young teenager, are arrangements of keyboard music by other composers. This is not plagiarism according to our contemporary notions of intellectual property\u2014freely transcribing the music of others was an everyday aspect of composition at that time. Some of the keyboard works of J. S. Bach are also transcriptions of pieces which he did not originally author. Like other composers of the period, Mozart sometimes wrote variations based on pre-existing material (his famous keyboard variations on the tune to \u2018Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star,\u2019 for instance). But by and large, Mozart\u2019s authorship of his works is not seriously questioned. ",

If someone else wrote the works, then someone else had the talent, so if they came into the light would we need to be suspicious of their ability and suggest yet someone else was involved? It is similar asking then who created god etc\u2026 The only issue would be misappropriation, we just have to accept the rare times when people are blessed with phenomenal abilities. To be suspicious of it can't help us for the works remain - someone wrote it, may as well have been Amadeus. ",

            "answer_text": "One of the things in the movie Amadeus that was apparently very accurate was a scene where Mozart is leaning over the pool table and rolling the cue ball so that it bounces and comes back to him. While the ball is in motion he writes a note on the staff then he catches the ball and rolls it again and writes another note. This was one of the ways he worked through the drudgery of writing down what was already finished in his head. I might also add that, as far as I know, Mozart is unique amongst the great composers in his capacity for composing whole symphonies, operas and concerti entirely in his head before ever putting pen to paper. So in terms of pen to paper writing, Mozart might have answered your question, \u201cLeider Gottes.\u201d ",
