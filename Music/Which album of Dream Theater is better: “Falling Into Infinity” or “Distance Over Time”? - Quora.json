            "answer_text": "I have a bit of a hard time being objective when it comes to some of Dream Theater\u2019s albums. While I do enjoy most of their albums with Mike Mangini (yeah, I\u2019m looking sideways at you, Astonishing; I had such high hopes for you), most of their Portnoy albums came with some sort of milestone for me, so they hold a special place. For Falling Into Infinity, that tour was the first time I saw them live. On my 30th birthday. And I got all of them to sign my CD booklet. So\u2026.yeah. I\u2019ve listened to that album many, many times over the years. In addition to the CD, I\u2019ve bought two different vinyl copies. Because. I just haven\u2019t listened to Distance Over Time enough for it to reach that same level. Give it 20 years. Maybe it will then. I don\u2019t know. But right now? Falling Into Infinity is the better album. In my opinion. ",

Not a \u201ccritical\u201d review, rather a collection of fan\u2019s remarks offered this:AVERAGE FAN OPINION List of Dream Theater albums from worst to best as taken from a fan poll \u2026  1) Metropolis Part 2: Scenes From A Memory 2) Images & Words 3) Awake 4) Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence 5) Train Of Thought 6) Octavarium 7) Distance Over Time 8) Systematic Chaos 9) Black Clouds & Silver Linings 10) A Dramatic Turn Of Events 11) Dream Theater 12) Falling Into Infinity 13) When Dream And Day Unite 14) The Astonishing  NOTE: This is a rough \"average list\" (mainly due to the divided opinions of the post-Portnoy era - namely ADTOE and DT and the band's albums with a greater focus on heavy metal - BC&SL and SC). Therefore, numbers #8-11 on the list here can very much be much higher or lower on people's lists. ",
