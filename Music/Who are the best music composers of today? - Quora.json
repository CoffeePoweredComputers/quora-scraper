            "answer_text": "There are so many wonderful composers out there now days. Being a working composer has never been common. However, being GREAT is a totally different thing. In my answer, I\u2019ll make the assumption that by composer you mean \u201cmedia composer\u201d (film/television/games) and not musical theater, library, etc. I\u2019ll also assume that by \u201cbest\u201d you likely mean \u201cmost well known\u201d or \u201cmost beloved\u201d. John WilliamsHans ZimmerThomas NewmanJames Newton HowardDanny ElfmanEnnio MorriconeVangelisLike I said, there are so many other wonderful composers. Many aren\u2019t mentioned here, have passed (James Horner) or have stopped composing. ",

            "answer_text": "Some great answers here from film and Bollywood especially! Some of my favorite modern composers include film composers Michael Giacchino, Thomas Newman, and the infamous John Williams. Bear McCleary is also great. I am not a gamer but I am impressed with the musical quality of game music. There are plenty of orchestral scores that are incredible and written for video games! There is also a plethora of unknown talent in today\u2019s world of home studio composing! Being famous or popular or well-known is not the only criteria for being a great music composer! ",
