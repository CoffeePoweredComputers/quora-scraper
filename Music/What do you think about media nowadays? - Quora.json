            "answer_text": "Who doesn\u2019t know about the social media today? Maybe your grandparents. But the generation of today goes along with social media. It has changed the world, changed the way of spending our precious time, and it has changed us to get addicted. There are 7.8 billion people in the world, with at least 3.5 billion of us online. This means social media platforms are used by one-in-three people in the world, and more than two-thirds of all internet users.  The rise of social media is an extraordinary example of how quickly and drastically social behaviors can change. Fast changes like those brought about by social media always spark fears about possible negative effects. Specifically in the context of social media, a key question is whether these new communication technologies are having a negative impact on our mental health \u2013 this is an important question. Facebook has dominated the social media market for a decade. It has the maximum number of users across the world. Other user-emerging social media platforms are Instagram, YouTube, Whats app, TikTok , Twitter, Snap Chat and many more. Social media is to be used for a good purpose and it must remain as a boon to ourselves and the entire world. And one more thing instead of spending too much time on social networks its better to read books and get an extra knowledge. For purchasing book just check the description above. Thanks for the A2A.

            "answer_text": "I get my news from CP24 usually because it's on in the lunchroom every day.  I got rid of Facebook because I don't care about your cat or what you ate for lunch. Truth be told, with the exception of perusing Instagram for pictures, the only active social media I engage in, is pretty much Twitter and Quora. Two sites who's content are usually trustworthy (Depending on who you're following or what you're reading) I don't even trust the BBC or the CBC to properly report on most issues these days. If there's one media company aligned with my values, I would have to say that's VICE, but even they, unfortunately, fall in the label of Media, and I am just very skeptical of the \"Media's\" agenda. They don't care about what I think or want, they want to impose THEIR thoughts and ideas to make more money, and I'm TOTALLY against that.   SO what do I think about the media nowadays, bunch of criminals as far as I'm concerned. Media use to be the power of the people. Not any more. And the past 10 years in Canada is a great example. Just read the first few paragraphs of this article: Trudeau To Reporters: 'I'll Be Back'  If our OWN Leader, won't tell us what's going on, and the media doesn't do anything about it, what good is the media? I thought they were the ones who demanded answers for the people? The ones who put their jobs or even lives, in jeopardy, to get to the truth? Oh wait, those are the journalists who have no say and are just trying to make a living. Riiiiiiiight!!!  ",
