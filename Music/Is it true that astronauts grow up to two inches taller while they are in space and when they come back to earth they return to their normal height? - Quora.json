            "answer_text": "Original question: Is it true that astronauts grow up to two inches taller while they are in space and when they come back to Earth they return to their normal height?  Short answer: Astronauts do tend to become taller, although they're not growing perse. It's just the lack of apparent gravity allowing the spine to stretch. Long answer: When a person is upright and walking around on Earth, gravity is pulling down on the body. The pressure can cause the discs between vertebrae to lose 15% of the fluid by the end of the day, resulting in the loss of up to 1/2\u2033 of height by bedtime.[1] (The discs reabsorb the fluids while horizontal, regaining that ~1/2\u2033 overnight.)  In microgravity, the opposite happens. There's no compression put on the spine, allowing it to stretch out. So there isn't any true growth going on, they do appear to be taller. Think of it like a slinky. There's only so much slinky, but it's apparent length varies whether it's stretched out or pushed together.  Of course, the opposite happens when an astronaut returns to Earth. Gravity once again pushes down on the spine, causing the astronaut to return to their pre-flight height. (While this may not be the best visual description, having found a video on making an origami slinky, I absolutely have to share it. It's far too cool not to share, properly compressed or otherwise.)  Footnotes[1] Why You're Taller in the Morning and Shorter At Night - Knowledge Stew",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not that the astronauts \u201cgrow\u201d taller when in space, but it has been observed many times that the astronauts do \u201cget\u201d taller in space. What\u2019s more, their height returns to normal once they get back on earth. So why would zero-g have an effect on height? My How You've Grown! The summary is that the discs between the vertebrae seems to expand a little in space due to them not having gravity compressing them all the time. This can be a big deal because once in space, if they get too tall they may not fit in their space suits any more: Expedition 41 Update: Oct. 3, 2014 For NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman and Barry Wilmore and European Space Agency astronaut Alexander Gerst, the bulk of the day was spent inside the Quest airlock as they resized their U.S. spacesuits for a pair of spacewalks beginning next week. Having collected measurements of their bodies on Tuesday to compare with baseline measurements taken before launch, the astronauts donned their spacesuits to make sure everything fit properly. These on-orbit fit checks are necessary because astronauts may grow up to 3 percent taller while living aboard the space station. ",
