            "answer_text": "Eazy-E didn't fall out with Dre technically. Eazy-E basically created Ruthless Records under tutelage from Jerry Heller (his manager and co-founder). Under the deal that most Jerry set up, NWA, including Eazy-E were basically robbed when showing how much they received in comparison to how much money they generated. Ice Cube noticed this initially and actually never signed the contract and of course was the first to go. Eventually Dre got Suge Knight's people to look over his contract and verify that it was an almost criminal deal. Since Dre had already signed the contract though he was legally stuck in it for the contractual time period he agreed to unless Eazy/Jerry would release him. Of course Jerry and Eazy didn't want to release profitable Dr. Dre, so Suge had some thugs come physically motivate Eazy to have to break the contract. That is basically what caused the beef and created the motivation for the song Real Mutha-Fuckin G's. Now please note that Eazy's daughter who was 4 at the time of his death is stating he didn't get a beat down but I do know that Dre was able to get out of his contract with Ruthless Records to help found Death Row with Suge when Jerry and Eazy didn't want to let him go, so it would be interesting to know what alternative way they were able to get him released.

            "answer_text": "Money. Eric Wright convinced the members of N.W.A. to sign contracts which gave them surprisingly small amounts individually of what was earned by the group collectively. When they learned this, things grew ugly and they never got better. The group eventually collapsed and its two most valuable members, Ice Cube and Dr. Dre simply walked off into successful solo careers. Had Eazy-E signed more equitable contracts with Dre it\u2019s almost a certainty that they could have remained at least business partners, if not friends, in the last years before his death. However, by signing contracts which essentially cheated his bandmates, Eazy-E alienated them and ended his relationships with them. ",
