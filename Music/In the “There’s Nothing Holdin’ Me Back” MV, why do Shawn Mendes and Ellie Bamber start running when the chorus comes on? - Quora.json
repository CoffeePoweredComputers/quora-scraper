            "answer_text": "If we listen to the lyrics carefully, the song says there is nothing holding him back from loving her. The song is not a break-up song, but the boy feels free when he Is with her. I feel Shawn and Ellie Bamber has acted brilliantly. The song is centered on how he loves the girl being funny, spontaneous, fearless, and gorgeous without trying to be. So this may be the reason for them running when the chorus comes on. ",
