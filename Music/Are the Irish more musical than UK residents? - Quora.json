But in a random sample, as an example of world leading musical acts, the UK has produced the Beatles, the Stones, Genesis, Iron Maiden, most of Fleetwood Mac, Peter Frampton, The Who, Robbie Williams, Take That, Bowie and many more. Ireland has produced 75% of U2. ",

Oasis, Sex Pistols, Beatles, Kate Bush, Elvis Costello, Morrissey, etc, etc, are all of Irish descent. That's aside from some great Irish (from Ireland) bands. So yeah. If not more musical, certainly AS musical. ",

As would every person of any other portion of the British Isles. Lots of great musicians all over, but in Wales it\u2019s simply a way of living. Not just for bands. For everyone. To see for yourself go to a rugby match anywhere else in Ireland and the UK and then go to one in Cardiff. ",
