            "answer_text": "After listening to all of his songs again (after whatever happened), I felt like all of his songs were actually not only songs, they were an account of what he had experienced, or what he had been going through. I watched many videos where he would be seen goofing around while being with the band. This actually is not something that we can\u2019t identify with- the moments when we are doing what we love to do keep us out of any darkness that we might be going through when we are lonely. It is quite a different brain when we are lonely and when we are not. His songs actually tell how good an observer he was. He had been battling with his own dark side- those thoughts for quite a time (apparently, since his childhood). I don\u2019t know what Chris Cornell meant to him. But if he was something Chester used to look up to, he might have felt heartbroken. Or, maybe he had lost the motivation to keep fighting as it had been so long already. His battle symphony gave up upon him. I think none other than his songs can explain it better. Also, it should send alarm to all of the audiences out there that the songs that artists make should not be only a means to lighten our mood, but we should also think about the artists who\u2019ve created it. LP songs have helped us to keep our heads high whenever we felt down; we were so into ourselves. Little could we have thought that the artists had been writing about themselves, things could have been made better. Suicides are no joke, depression is not to be taken easy just because you\u2019re not into the subject\u2019s shoes. Everyone is human. LP songs were an outcome of every band member\u2019s work. We should think about them also. Instead of only mourning deaths, we should act against potential losses. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is very easy, though very painful. Chester was a known patient of depression. Ever since he was a child, he was abused at home, school and every place he went. He was also in a forced relationship with an older man, although the details of that are quite blurry. All this rage was fueled by his constant drug abuse and addiction. He was literally a shadow of his former self. Although Linkin Park gave him all the support they could and formed an integral part of his life, the depression still hit him and, on the death of his close friend, Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell, he couldn\u2019t take it anymore and chose to hang himself on the 20th of July, what would have been Chris Cornell\u2019s 53rd birthday. This is what depression does to you\u2026. R.I.P. Chester. You will be missed  ",
