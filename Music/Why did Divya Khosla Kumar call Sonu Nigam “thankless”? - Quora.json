            "answer_text": "T-series launched Sonu Nigam and gave him his first break to him in the music industry, so according to that, she thinks he should not have said all those things about Bhushan Kumar on his recent video. Sonu should be more grateful foe people who helped him in the initial stage. Basically her logic is straight forward, if someone helps you or gives you an opportunity, you forever should endure abuse and be under their foot as long as they exist, you should never speak up against their harassment. If we go by her logic, we can only assume what all she has gone through and still going through but keeping quiet about it because she doesnt want to be ungrateful. P.S - Sonu Nigam warned Bhushan Kumar to back off and stop spreading lies about him and also counted the number of times Bhushan Kumar came crying to him for help. He also mentioned a particular name of a female model/actress whom he has the video evidence, which would reveal the original face of Bhushan Kumar to the world. He told him that if he wont back off then he will release thar video in his official youtube account in detail for everyone to understand. ",
