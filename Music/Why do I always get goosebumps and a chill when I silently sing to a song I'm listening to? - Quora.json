            "answer_text": "I think it could be either of two things (maybe even both): If you didn\u2019t know the song, you wouldn\u2019t sing along, obviously. So maybe the fact that you know the words and can sing along to the song is exciting to you. Your brain recognizes the familiar words and tune and becomes excited. Thus, it releases \u2018happy\u2019 chemicals (they come from the brain, hence \u2018neurochemicals\u2019), like oxytocin, dopamine and serotonin, which cause you to feel that \u2018tingly\u2019 sensation/chillsMaybe the lyrics have a subconscious, deeper meaning to you that you don\u2019t even realize. So, you actually feel the music, the words, the sounds, the beat, you just get lost in it, and similarly to above, your brain releases the previously listed neurochemicals resulting in the chillsHope this was helpful!
