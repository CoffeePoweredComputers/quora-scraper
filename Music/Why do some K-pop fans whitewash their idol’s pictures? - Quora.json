            "answer_text": "You need to differentiate between photo enhancement and whitewashing. Good photos you\u2019ve seen in the magazine and promotional properties are taken under controlled condition, with calibrated lighting, which allows the result to be as flawless as the photographer wants. Photos taken by fansites don\u2019t have this advantage. They are mostly taken under harsh sunlight or little to dim light except for their flash at night or super crappy indoor lighting. Take it as doing your own selfie/shot. Most of the time the lighting sucks, the angle sucks, etc. Same case. Fansites enhance their photos by the elaborate effort of brightening, tuning contrast and saturation in photo editor program afterward. Resulting in a decent photo. How elaborate? Well, try enhancing your image in Instagram app before uploading. If you amp up the brightness, your whole skin tone could change and the result can somewhat look unnatural. Thus next they need to tune the saturation and contrast. They also add tint to make it looks more natural, and so on. Do you know how many photos they took? And how many photos they deemed decent enough to be edited to upload later? Imagine you have to redo and duplicate the process for each photo. That\u2019s not an easy task. It\u2019s also time-consuming. Thus, they save the preset (as we call it in Photoshop) to use for the whole batch. Applying it for all of the photos and just edit what\u2019s lacking afterward. This is easier and makes the whole batch looks like having the same \u2018tone\u2019, which is a sign of consistency. And any consistency is good, it\u2019s professional-looking. Definitely much better in the eyes. I\u2019m not a fan of \u2018whitewash\u2019 either but some idols are indeed pale. While not NW13 kind of pale (probably Sulli, yes), some can go up to NC20-NC35. Therefore, editing their skin tone to tan or somewhat orange is also unnatural and unrealistic. ",

            "answer_text": "Simply a beauty standard in Korea, although I\u2019d say Asia in general, Indonesia has the same outlook on pale skin, but Korea has it on more full throttle as it has been highly sought after since even historical days. There are idols who are often pressured to have their skin lighter, as they would always be constantly teased for being dark. One of my favorites, VIXX\u2019s N, has always been taunted on and off screen for looking like \u201ca dark circle\u201d, it continues to hurt me even though he himself has said he\u2019s used to the numerous comments. Lots of his fansite masters (the unofficial \u201cphotographers\u201d of idol groups, if you will) overly saturate his skin color within image uploads. Although most fansites have refuted the fact that their heavily edited photographs are meant to increase the aesthetic and overall mood of the picture, I have witnessed some who commented on how they look prettier when lighter, hence encouraging the essence of whitewashing, be it directly or indirectly. There was one recent case where a fansite master has been attacked for uploading pictures of the idol with his natural skin tone and even unedited traits such as pores and pimples. Celestial Boy, one of BTS Jimin\u2019s most recent fansite, ended up deactivating (or was it short hiatus?) after being slandered by fans for displaying his imperfections. (I personally found this image so beautifully taken, natural skin color and all, it\u2019s almost like a breath of fresh air given most of the stark white edited pictures other masters would share.)
