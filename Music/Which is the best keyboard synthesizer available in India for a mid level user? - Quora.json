            "answer_text": "I agree with Shriram on the choices he wrote about. I\u2019ll just provide my opinion on this. Beginner - Yamaha E-363 or higher. I\u2019m extremely biased towards Yamaha as a beginners\u2019 keyboard, although I\u2019ve heard that Casio is good too. Intermediate - By now, you would have already decided if you want a workstation (Korg Kross / Krome) or an arranger (Yamaha higher PSR series / Korg PA series), or a digital piano, if you want to go that way, or a MIDI board and VST. If not, drop me a note, will help you figure it out. Workstation - Understand your requirements well. Go for Korg Krome, or Roland Juno DS 61 or 88, or Yamaha Motif series, depending upon what you like. Arranger - Yamaha higher PSR series is good. Digital Piano - Roland FP 30, Yamaha P45 or P115. Expert - Sorry, no clue. :) Haven\u2019t gotten there. ",

            "answer_text": "I am not aware of the expertise level of the user. so a mid level is difficult to specify. The ideal person who can guide is the keyboard teacher himself. He / she would know the level of the pupil and suggest a 1 or 2 stage higher keyboard that will suffice for 2\u20133 levels above. Here I would state that relation of the music instrument with the player is the same as the magic wand and witch/wizard as described in Harry Potter books. One learns the nuances of the instrument over years of playing and forms a strong affilation. I would suggest a few keyboards though. Yamaha PSRI1455 61 key may be one just above entry level, neverthaless is a good equipment for most uses. Casio CTK7300 series is also equivalent. Higher than these are Roland XPS10. Roland E09IN is more suited for Indian instruments and sounds. You may alos take online help from Wikiguide on \u201cHow to Buy a Keyboard\u201d ",
