            "answer_text": "Clinical is to do with diagnosing and treating patients.  It includes clinical aspects of medicine, but also the work of non-medically qualified clinicians such as such as nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists etc. Medical is a more complex term which has different meanings depending on the context.  In general use, it refers to the activity of anyone who has a medical degree and works as a qualified medical practitioner.  However, within the activities of qualified medical practitioners the term medical is also used to distinguish specifically the activities of physicians, as opposed to surgeons, psychiatrists and other non-physician qualified medical practitioners.

On the other hand the term medical may mean non-surgical and clinical would apply to both. I agree with Dr. User that they could have been used interchangeably by the speaker. ",
