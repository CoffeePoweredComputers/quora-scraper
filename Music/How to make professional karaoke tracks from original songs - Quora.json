            "answer_text": "Karaoke tracks which are made from original songs are termed as \u2018Vocal Cut\u2019. Such karaoke songs are produced by using software which is capable of removing or minimizing the center frequencies of a stereo song. Usually, a stereo song has vocals, bass and some more instruments in the center position. When these center points are eliminated, the vocals and other instruments are also removed or minimized. This way, the original feel of the song is lost along with the instruments used. So technically, even if you have the karaoke made using software, it won\u2019t be so good to be termed as \u2018professional\u2019 as it should otherwise. To make a professional sounding stage performance karaoke, you need to produce the entire song using either \u2018live\u2019 instrumentation recorded in studio, or using a software capable of producing sounds of instruments and/or midi input, along with filters, effects & mastering tools like FL Studio, Reason, Ableton Live, Pro Tools, Darkwave Studio etc. If you plan to produce professional karaoke, I would suggest you do some programming in DAWs (Digital Audio Workstation) mentioned above. For how to learn making music in DAWs, you can message me. I have been producing professional premium karaoke since the past 15 years for myself and my clients. Hope this helps you :) Best of luck~! :) ",
