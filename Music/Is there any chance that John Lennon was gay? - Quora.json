            "answer_text": "There is certainly a chance, but, personal opinion, it was unlikely. Their managemlent l, Brian Epstein, was (for the times\u2026 remember homosexuality was still illegal in the U.K. then\u2026 relatively) openly gay, and, again given the times, the Beatles were quite comfortable with it. It certainly wasn\u2019t an issue for any of them. Moreover, by all accounts, Epstein had a crush on John, and the two famously went on holiday to Spain for two weeks in 1963. It has long been rumored that they consummated their relationship there. However, neither of the principles ever publicly admitted to such a thing. The One story of what actually happened in Spain\u2026 and this literally the only one that has a slight chance of being fact-based in my opinion\u2026 comes from one of John\u2019s Liverpool buds. He claims that, shortly after returning from Spain, he visited John at his Aunt Mimi\u2019s and couldn\u2019t resist making a crack about John and Epstein. John rolled his eyes because people had been whispering such tripe almost continuously since his return but then admitted that something did happen. Apparently (and this is what the friend Pete Shotten says John said), the vacation mostly consisted of John watching Epstein hit on guys, with little success. But Epstein also made it clear that John was the one he really wanted. It wasn\u2019t an issue until one day, Epstein had a few too many and started professing his love for John. John played it off for a while but Epstein persisted until John got annoyed and eventually just plain angry. He finally dropped his drawers and bent over, saying words to the effect \u201cif you want me so bad just do it\u201d but in a tone that made it clear he\u2019d be allowed to do no such thing. Epstein blithely replied that he wasn\u2019t \u201cinto\u201d that kind of thing so John needn\u2019t worry. John was shocked and wanted to know what Epstein WAS into. It turns out Epstein liked to\u2026 well\u2026 to give manual pleasure to others with his hand. John immediately stopped being angry and immediately felt awful for him\u2026 among other things, Epstein would regularly get his ass whupped by guys he hit on and John suddenly realized all he ever wanted to do was use his hand on them. It seemed like these gorillas were over-reacting\u2026 or more likely over compensating\u2026 to a ridiculous extent, especially considering they almost certainly led Epstein on for a while before bashing him. In any case, out of great sympathy for a friend in need, John turned around then and there and let Epstein use his hand on him. And that was it. It didn\u2019t lead anywhere else or to anything more. It never happened again that John ever acknowledged\u2026 Epstein never mentioned or acknowledged it all. And honestly, it would have been difficult for them to repeat it without quickly getting caught by others. John was married, of course, so he wouldn\u2019t likely get away occasional homosexual liaisons in the bed he shared with Cynthia. What? You say John cheated on Cynthia for the entirety of their marriage and never particularly tried to hide it so why would homosexual lovers be any different. They wouldn\u2019t. But John was becoming one of the most recognizable humans on the planet. The rest of the band and the rest of the world pretty much knew he was cheating so nobody thought twice about seeing him with another woman and nobody much cared.. The band and the world\u2026. well\u2026 let\u2019s just say they\u2019d have noticed if a dude slipped into the mix. If it somehow didn\u2019t explode into the news then, certainly a few legitimate, believeable stories with witnesses would have many their way into the media in all the years since John\u2019s death but not a single one has. Most of the rest of his friends To this day, the one and only story of John committing a homosexual act is the Story related above that came from John Shotten. . In all the years before or since, not a single person has come forward who claimed to have had a liaison with John or who heard of somebody else having a liaison. Admittedly, that is not airtight evidence In fact, it is kind of the opposite: A complete lack of airtight evidence\u2026. of his homosexuality\u2026. and really a complete lack even of anything with a modest chance of being vaguely true. Maybe that isn\u2019t the best evidence and maybe that wouldn\u2019t hold up in court very often. It WOULD however hold up in court quite nicely When the only evidence in favor of his being gay is that which has been publicly presented to date: I.e. nothing. Than it becomes very compelling. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s confirmed Lennon had sexual interest in men, and there\u2019s a clear pattern in his actions and writing to support the idea that he was confused about his sexual identity and his relationship with Paul in particular. All of his love songs are to Paul \u2014 he\u2019s not writing love songs to Yoko, all of his most passionate songs come from the early Beatle years when the \u201cyou\u201d in John\u2019s songs make the most sense if you assume he\u2019s talking, indirectly, about his relationship with Paul. John & Paul confirmed they were passing notes to each other in songs. We know of the obvious ones - How Do You Sleep, Dear Friend, etc \u2014 but it\u2019s far more expansive. Their early Beatles songs set the pattern and they both return to it in their solo years with callbacks to their \u201cletter writing\u201d days (PS I Love You, It Won\u2019t Be Long, All I Have To Do, From Me to You, etc) \u2014 when Paul lived a bit further away from John and they were communicating by phone/letters. IMO it\u2019s naive to assume the Beatles were all straight. They were subversive characters in a heteronormative world \u2014 even just having long hair was considered radical for a man at the time! \u2014 and it was LITERALLY ILLEGAL to be homosexual in England in Liverpool in the 1950s. Yet Liverpool was ALSO a centre of LGBT culture particularly the music clubs. Brian Epstein, their manager, was about as \u201cout\u201d as one could be, and he could somewhat afford to do so coming from a bit more money, and even then it was not known at the time publicly; only after his death. I think Paul has a \u201ctell all\u201d memoir up his sleeve that he\u2019s waiting to release until after either Yoko or he passes. There\u2019s more to the official story of Lennon & McCartney, and we can only speculate on specifics. The real question is \u2014 considering we already know and feel comfortable with Lennon & McCartney\u2019s partnership being a \u2018marriage\u2019 \u2014 does it ruin for you if they physicalized their love? That\u2019s the interesting thing. If it turns out the Beatles were basically Queen but closeted, how many fans would suddenly reject them? Considering this, we can understand a bit more of Lennon and again it\u2019s all in his writing. Lennon\u2019s songs are madly in love, until Beatles For Sale when he\u2019s been rejected (No Reply, I\u2019m A Loser) and Paul is defensive (What You\u2019re Doing) and threatening to leave (I\u2019ll Follow the Sun). The official story is Paul\u2019s songs are to Jane Asher. They may well be to both, but they are all, on some level, to John, almost always. \u201cHey Jude\u201d is the best example. Most songs are to at least 3 intended recipients. It\u2019s coded language; learned from a coded culture by necessity. It\u2019s to Julian, to John, and to the fictional Jude. And maybe more. We only found out two years ago that John & Paul would sit around and masturbate together. It might\u2019ve all been casual like that, and it definitely was thought of very differently. What they did know for sure was that being \u201chomosexual\u201d and \u201cgay\u201d and \u201cqueer\u201d was always bad \u2014 and yet, in spite of all the danger, they found a form of love that filled their souls in a way that nobody else really matched. Anyway. It\u2019s possible John and Paul were/are queer/bi but remain publicly closeted for whatever reason. It\u2019s tempting to assume we know everything there is to know about them because there\u2019s so much media to track their emotions and mindsets and actions to the hour almost, but ultimately naive. So I remain open minded on it and wouldn\u2019t be shocked to learn we didn\u2019t know the half of it. It\u2019d be great fun. ",
