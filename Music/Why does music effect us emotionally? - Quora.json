            "answer_text": "Okay, this is actually quite interesting. I'll give you the Psychology viewpoint, given my background (neuroscience rarely gives you a \"why\", more of a \"how\" and maybe similarities between phenomena). There are three main ways to consider, with the last one being the most sexy one by far ;-) - Most boring one: Conditioning, or the \"darling, they're playing our tune\" effect. Music is an ubiquitous phenomenon in our society, and especially underlies the nice parts of our lives. If a song connects to a specific event in your biography (first date, listened to after break up, song that was always played during that super nice vacation, ...) it will evoke corresponding emotions.  - More complex one: Appraisal. This is a little more technical, but also not the focal point of my answer, because the third one is so much more intriguing. So, this refers to how emotions (sometimes) develop, which is a combination of basic arousal and cognition / appraisal. Same applies to music, where the more basic elements (rhythm, stabilizing and destabilizing our sense of \"harmony\") creates a basic arousal and certain features of music correspond then to certain emotions (or rather schemas of emotions), so the arousal get's appraised in that way which in turn constitutes an emotion. I know this is super vague, but I hope the general idea comes across. I'm just not huge on cognitivist emotion theories, so I'll leave it here.  - The (IMO) most interesting one: Because music IS emotion, or rather emotional communication. Music makes you sad / happy in much the same way as a crying or laughing person alters your emotions, i.e. by your capability for empathy. Did you ever hear about mirror neurons? That is how empathy works. You simulate the expressive behavior you perceive within yourself, experience the state it represents in a way, and therefor you can understand what other people are feeling and going to do. Now, this is not only true for things like facial expressions or tonality. Since the ability to \"mind read\" is so crucially important for us humans (evolutionary), we developed also the ability to simulate a person's emotions simply from the way the person affects it's environment, like how it writes, how it decorates a room and so on. Music now is an activity that most certainly has the necessary expressive richness for a person to communicate it's emotions. In fact, there are theories that music really developed just for this purpose: As a means of pure and direct emotional communication, where the emotions of one person are realized rawly, without overshadowing thought-content like in language, so that other persons (the audience) can simulate the emotions from the emotional communication and thereby experience what the musician was feeling when he \"encoded\" his message. I really love this idea, that music is a way of communication going parallel to everyday, content-related communications, and allows for a direct transfer of emotions from one person to the other.  If you're interested in that, look for Einfuehlung, there is plenty of research starting to back this theory up. ",

            "answer_text": "Music uses the vibration of sound waves to express human thoughts and emotions or reflect life. Over time, many scholars have found that music is closely related to mood. As a supplement to psychological research, music psychology mainly studies the influence of music on human psychology (Krumhansl, 1995) . Emotion is a state of mind, it is a kind of internal persistent state, so emotion has persistence. Emotions are generated from themselves, but also from the surrounding environment. When something comes to mind, it goes through the amygdala first. The amygdala is an important structure in the brain for social cognition, and its stimulation can trigger an emotional response. Music is innate in inducing emotions. Infants can recognize the emotions expressed by music at a very early age, and such cognition is innate (Hargreaves & North, 1999) . This paper will analyze the relationship between music and emotion from the perspective of the influence of music on brain mechanism and the role of music in cognition. The effects of music on brain mechanisms Since researchers discovered that music could affect mood, more and more researchers have become involved in emotional cognitive neuroscience. Many researchers used fMRI (magnetic resonance imaging) to directly observe the brain activity of participants during musical cognition. Schmidt and Trainor (2001) proposed that there was a relationship between the frontal lobe electrical activity and emotion. The left frontal lobe of the brain is responsible for experiencing positive emotions, such as pleasure and pleasure. In contrast, the right frontal lobe is responsible for experiencing negative emotions, such as fear and sadness. The researchers found that different frontal lobes of the brain react differently to different music. Different concerts have different emotional effects on people. It has been shown that familiarity can increase subjects' emotional responses (Dalla Bella et al., 2001) . Subjects had more difficulty identifying atonal musical structures than tonal ones. Robinson and his colleagues found that negative and pessimistic music clips influenced emotional responses the most. So, music has a direct physiological effect on the nervous system (Hargreaves & North, 1999) .It was found that pleasant music significantly reduced pain, suggesting that the positive emotions brought by music can be reduced pain. Because the structure of the music itself is encoded at different tonal levels. And emotional information is encoded by different structural cues. The direction of the tonic key of the music determines the feeling of tension or relaxation. The level of tonality affects emotional arousal. Different kinds of music vary due to the beat and rhythm. Music at different speeds feels different. For example, the subjects were asked to listen to two versions of a piece of music. The first version is a piano solo with a light and smooth speed. The second version is a slow version with an accompaniment (Ellis & Thayer, 2010) . People's appreciation of music is not only affected by the characteristics of music, but also by many subjective and objective factors. So, it is not just timbre and rhythm that people use to judge the mood of music. Music also has more complex effects on brain mechanisms. M\u00fcnte and collegues (M\u00fcnte et al., 2002) used cortical DC electroencephalography (EEG) to identify the extensive effect of music on bilateral frontal lobe loss. By using fMRI, Griffiths (2003) found that the brain's bilateral superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and right posterior inferior frontal gyrus produced responses to music cognition. In addition, the amygdala and basal ganglia also play an important role in emotional processing. The limbic system plays a major role in the emotional processing of music. The limbic system, which belongs to the old cortex, is relatively primitive. This also confirms the archaic nature of the origin of music. Music and Cognition The limbic system is also one of the factors psychologists consider influencing cognition. Music also plays an important role in cognition. The cognitive stage precedes the emotional stage. For example, the audience cannot understand the beauty of a humorous joke without understanding its meaning. But the cognitive stage is not necessarily followed by the emotional stage. For example, a person does not necessarily laugh at a joke when he gets it. The same is true for music. A recognition of the surface layer of musical works during sound perception in music appreciation. In other words, an appreciation of the sound and structure of music. This is the foundation of listening to music (Sweeney & Wyber, 2002) . Sound perception, or music perception, is based on the enjoyment of music. Aiello proposed that the influences of music on cognitive function are diverse, and most of them depend on people's personality and the need for external stimuli. They used a personality test called the Boredom Proneness Scale to determine the need for external stimuli. Participants were asked to complete A simple cognitive task (looking for an A in A word list) and A challenging cognitive task (remembering words). They divided the participants into two groups: those who completed the simple tasks first, and those who completed the challenging tasks first. Participants completed the task in three sound conditions: no music, simple music and complex music. The data show that listening is the best learning tool for people who do not need external stimulation. This study suggests that the effects of music on cognitive function vary from person to person. The increased complexity of cognitive tasks may also reduce or eliminate the benefits of music (Gonzalez & Aiello, 2019) . The knowledge of the challenging task (remembering word combinations) in the study was moderately difficult, but the complexity of the challenging task was enough to blunt the positive effects of the music compared to the simple task (Meyer, 2001) . Therefore, music did not have a positive effect on text comprehension or exam preparation, even for people with low external stimuli. So, using the right instrument for the right person at the right time and on the right task can show the significant impact of music on cognitive function. Conclusion To sum up, music has a great influence on mood swings. The brain's limbic system is the most responsive. However, there are individual differences in music cognition. Although musical emotional response varies greatly, its basic mechanism is very simple: tension at low physiological level -- relaxation movement change. This simple model brings sensation, attention, and consciousness into its orbit in different forms, thereby relieving tension. Reference Dalla Bella, S., Peretz, I., Rousseau, L., & Gosselin, N.
