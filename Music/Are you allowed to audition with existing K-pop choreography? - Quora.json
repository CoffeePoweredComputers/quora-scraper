            "answer_text": "Yes, you are allowed to copy existing K-pop choreography. But remember that most of the judges who will be judging you on your audition knows most of the dance choreography in almost all k-pop songs. Try to do study dancing first and then watching various dance lessons videos again and then try to do a good job in performing it. Best of luck if you\u2019re planning to audition. ",

They\u2019re not seeing you to see how well you can choreograph - that will come later in the training period. However, if you want to choreograph yourself, you can. ",
