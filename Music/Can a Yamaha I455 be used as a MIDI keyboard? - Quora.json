            "answer_text": "Yes, you can. It has a USB out which you can use to connect it to your computer and use it as a MIDI controller as well\u2026.. Need i warn you that it doesn\u2019t require any special drivers and I have so far not noticed any problems on both my PC laptop and my MacBook Pro so far. Though it doesn\u2019t have any faders and knobs so using it solely for automations is nowhere an option and performing live also means that you\u2019ll have to invest in something else with faders and knobs.
