Though, BTS were nominated once for recording package of love yourself:tear album (in 2019 I guess), and they have also performed on the grammys with Lil Nas X. The nominations for 2021 grammys haven't been announced yet, but I don't honestly think blackpink has much chances of winning. Anyway, I think you must have heard these things from delusional blinks who just spread baseless rumours without any proof. ",
