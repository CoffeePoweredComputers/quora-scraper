            "answer_text": "Maybe Twice, BTS and Blackpink, since Twice has Japanese Born members and BTS, has been in the Japanese market since 2014. Having Japanese Members means a boost in your success in Japan. (same as EXO before 2017 in China). BTS entered the Japanese Market in 2014 because then they weren't doing very good in Korea so they decide to enter the Japanese Market to take it as a chance of success. In 2015 BTS just toured in Japan and Korea and they didn't make it out to the rest of Asia. But Japan was the first success of BTS they had outside of Korea. Blackpink is hit in Japan, I walked into a restaurant in Japan in Dec 2018 and they were playing Blackpink\u2019s Ddu-du-Ddu-du in Japanese and the chef was singing and dancing to it. If you can make a restaurant chef in Japan to dance to your songs that\u2019s called success (jk) but there\u2019s my evidence. BLACK PINK has their Hit songs recording in Japanese to Expand their Asian market so There is also a success in Japan. ",

            "answer_text": "TVXQ As a five member group, they definitively broke into Japan with \u201cPurple Line\u201d, their first #1 single back in 2008. Even before that though, they were getting into the Top 10 and Top 3. To date, they have the most #1 singles of any foreign artist in Japan, as well as the highest CD sales. At the height of their success, they became quite ubiquitous. Some restaurants even had dishes named after them, and the group got to perform at Tokyo Dome, which is considered the pinnacle. They were the first K-Pop group to do so. They were also the first and only international act to perform at Nissan Stadium, the country\u2019s biggest venue.  Even now as a duo, they haven\u2019t lost their appeal. 680,000 people attended their most recent tour, and the tour prior attracted over 1,000,000 fans. Notable mentions BTS (Their recent releases having been selling well, and the Japanese leg of their recent tour brought in 380,000 fans) TWICE (They\u2019ve very recently seen a big surge in Japanese popularity) SEVENTEEN (Moderately successful tour sales recently) SHINee (They always do well\u2026) EXO (Their Japanese activities have been successful, strong potential) BIGBANG (They have a long and strong Japanese record behind them, and their last tour was highly successful in Japan) ",

All of them have had a successful Japanese debut, with their songs charting high on Oricon. Among older groups, TVXQ is still very popular, and I think most kpop fans here know about them. Of course, there are more kpop groups that are known in Japan, but as far as I have seen, these 3 are currently dominating the kpop scene in Japan. I think Seventeen is massively blowing up in Japan. They recently broke a 47-year-old record on Oricon for hitting #1 for 3 consecutive years :) ",

Twice albums and singles have all gone platinum and even multi platinum in Japan and they released three singles and three albums - so a truly incredible track record. BTS has similar sales in Japan with their Japanese album. EDIT: these are the most popular RIGHT NOW. Of course in the past TVXQ and Girls Generation were massively popular. But even EXO has not matched Twice and BTS sales with their latest Japanese releases. ",
