Many people have problem with his songs(they hate his songs). Many people roast him and make memes or jokes about him and in turn giving him popularity. I don\u2019t hate him, actually i like two of his songs, mile ho tum humko and hook up song. Otherwise I don\u2019t remember any of his songs because I don\u2019t listen to songs again and again which i don\u2019t like but I don\u2019t know who forces some people to listen to songs they don\u2019t like again and again and make them on trending.
