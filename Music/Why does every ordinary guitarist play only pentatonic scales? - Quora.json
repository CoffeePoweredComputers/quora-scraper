            "answer_text": "Pentatonic scales are the basis of most folk music around the world. Modern popular music forms are derived from traditional folk music. Casual guitar players don\u2019t seem to know this, though, because the importance of pentatonic scales is not pushed in music education as much as learning how to manipulate and exploit heptatonic (seven-tone) scales following the traditions of European classical music. When people learn music theory, they learn how to play heptatonic scales on pianos. They might be told that pentatonic scales are important, but then the curriculum quickly returns focus to heptatonic scale music. Pentatonic scales are the orphans of the musical establishment, which is an exclusive club that most people who play guitar don\u2019t belong to. We learn our music theory in a different way. When you attempt to play modern popular music on guitar, the first thing you learn is a bunch of chords. You learn the chords for the song and strum along. The chords sound very nice with the mostly pentatonic melody being sung or played on other instruments. You notice that certain set of chords seem to always be the chords called for to accompany a singer or an instrumental soloist. Something is going on here and you want to know what it is so you can play lead instead of strumming the chords written above the lyrics on that song sheet you\u2019ve been given by the songwriter. Since the playing techniques we use and our instruments are structured to accommodate the 12-tone chromatic scale, we learn how to play music in that form. There are twelve different tones in each octave to use, so we do stuff with them. What novice guitar player hasn\u2019t experimented with sliding a single chord shape up and down the neck and wondering how to make it all sound good? These experiments produce some interesting sounds, but most of us quickly become frustrated that our idiosyncratic concoctions of random sequences of chords sound like crap. We want to know what the structure is that makes all those \u201cgood\u201d songs So, those who want to break out from from just strumming chords, and not knowing why certain chords go together, start learning music theory. They learn about scales and pianos and accidentals and modulating and chord progressions and staff notation and key signatures and loads of other stuff that doesn\u2019t seem to help at all. What they want is some kind of skeleton cookbook to make their instrumental solos sound good. Most importantly, they want to replicate solos that make everyone go, \u201cOooooh\u2026\u201d Most people who attempt to make the leap from chord shapes to solo playing quickly discover that simple chord shapes can be held and the strings can be plucked rapidly in cyclic patterns to make it sound like a lot of fancy fingering. This all works pretty well until one day you realize that all you\u2019re playing is \u201cdootly-dootly-dootly\u201d over and over. It\u2019s boring as hell and you want to know what is is that all those fancy lead guitarists are doing as their fingers fly over the fingerboard in seemingly random patterns cranking out snazzy lead riffs so effortlessly. How do they know where to put their fingers? You think, \u201cThey\u2019re not playing scales the way that guy who gave me guitar lessons taught me! It sounds different!\u201d Then, one day, someone tips you off about the \u201csecret knowledge\u201d of how to play guitar solos that sound \u201cright\u201d with nearly any song in nearly every genre of popular music. This mentor shows you \u201cthe box\u201d. This is the moving window of four fret positions that you can position anywhere on the neck that you can reach. You position the box at the fret position where the notes you play using the box pattern as a template coincide with the key in which the piece is set. The mentor demonstrates how to align the box based on the tonic of the scale and then demonstrates how well it works. Major or minor? No problem! You can use the same pattern, but the tonic is at a different position in the box. This is cool! Now, four fret positions on each of six strings is 24 different tones. However the secret pattern only indicates that you play just twelve of them. As you experiment with this pattern, you eventually figure out that you\u2019re only using five different tones in each octave. You remember that five minutes the music teacher spent on pentatonic scales and you get it. Solos using pentatonic scales sound \u201cgood\u201d to most people because they are familiar forms. Moreover, heptatonic scales with the same tonic somehow don\u2019t sound a \u201cright\u201d with most popular music forms as solos. When you run the heptatonic scale, it sounds like \u201cdo, re, mi\u2026\u201d and you feel like some middle-school dork again, just like when you were a middle-school dork who wanted to be a rock star and didn\u2019t have a clue. The heptatonic scales can sound \u201ccorny\u201d and trite compared to the pentatonic scales. You may not understand why, but you know that it does. A lot of guitar players stop right there and never delve any further into music theory than learning how to exploit pentatonic scales for lead solo playing. They have found the sound that pleases listeners and they revel in being able to create it instantly using \u201cthe box\u201d. It works for them and they don\u2019t want to mess with it. They usually learn how to play pentatonic scales with other patterns, they quickly learn that if you stick to the pentatonic scale, you can\u2019t go wrong. Your solo may sound formulaic and unoriginal, but it will never sound \u201cwrong\u201d. (end of answer to question)I should quit here, but one of the answers I looked at gave an explanation of the relationship of blues to the pentatonic scale that seemed backwards and overly complex because it was based on the point of view of someone who learned heptatonic scales first and view the blues idiom as a perturbation of the Ionian (major) heptatonic scale by the addition of two additional tones from the 12-tone chromatic scale, the so-called \u201cblue notes\u201d. That is, they see it as, \u201cPlay a set 12-bar chord progression, I-I-I-I, IV-IV-I-I, V-IV-I-V, but liven it up by mixing in accidentals, a \u266d3 and a \u266d7, by playing dominant 7th chords I7 and IV7 in addition to V7, which does not contain and accidental.\u201d No, no, no! That\u2019s completely the wrong way to look at it! The blues soloist doesn\u2019t use the Ionian scale at all. Blues solos usually stick pretty much to a straight pentatonic minor scale with the same tonic as the Ionian scale everyone thinks you are using, the \u201ckey\u201d in which the song is supposedly set. If you stick to that pentatonic scale, your solo will sound like blues. Two out of five tones in your soloing scale don\u2019t coincide with the major scale, the minor 3rd and the minor 7th. These are the blue notes. If you throw in any other tones from the 12 available, that is, any of the other seven not in your pentatonic scale, it probably won\u2019t sound so bluesy. If you absolutely must deviate from the pentatonic scale, you can throw in an occasional \u266d5, usually as a passing tone between the perfect 5th and the perfect 4th (which are both in your pentatonic scale), or as a trill with either of those two adjacent tones. The point of changing your thinking on this format is to refocus the conceptualization of the form, reverting to the original African pentatonic form on which blues is based. What you do is play your African melody over the top of the rhythm section\u2019s \u201cIonian scale with two extra tones\u201d chord progression. When you do that, it sounds \u201cauthentic\u201d. When you play too many of those Ionian scale tones, your solo starts sounding like bluegrass or some kind of cowboy song. You won\u2019t like the result. Guitar players stick to pentatonic scales for solos because it\u2019s easy, safe and people like it. It\u2019s a good idea to do that until you know what you\u2019re doing. When you do figure out how to actually function as a classical or jazz guitarist, you can get away with playing anything you want. ",

            "answer_text": "A lot of guitar books and YouTube videos teach this, but I would not even have guitarists learn the pentatonic at all. Let me give you my own history. I was already bored with the pentatonic phase when I started on the guitar. In school music lessons we were using the Orff method, playing xylophones. The first thing our music teacher said to us each time he got them out was \u2018take out the Fs and the Bs\u2019 (he was a well-regarded concert pianist, by the way). We did a couple of years of pentatonic music, 80 minutes a week, before I ever picked up a guitar. I was much more interested in learning to play blues when I started improvising on guitar, and blues is not based on the pentatonic. Perhaps I should qualify that. Blues, at least by the 1980s, contained the notes of the pentatonic, but it contained something else as well, the \u2018blue\u2019 note, which is somewhere round an augmented fourth or diminished fifth in the minor blues, but bent, so it doesn\u2019t land on any particular note.  I\u2019ve written this out slightly differently from the way you would normally see it. Typically you will see a Bb in the penultimate note of the minor blues, but what I\u2019m often hearing is the B, bent up, or the Bb bent up a whole tone, so that it covers the B as often as not, and it tends to hover on the B more than the Bb. You often won\u2019t see a bend on that note at all in earlier blues books, but it was in all the blues I was listening to, and it\u2019s always been part of my blues vocabulary. In strict terms, the Major blues is a pentatonic plus a minor third (which is why you can often jam with a minor scale over a major key in blues), and the Minor blues is a hexatonic. You don\u2019t often hear guitarists playing the major blues which is more reminiscent of Ragtime than it is of the \u2018after-midnight\u2019 sound which was brought into rock. It\u2019s the minor blues most people are working on.  I always advise guitarists to learn the regular diatonic scale, and then to learn the chromatic scale.  Diatonic  Chromatic Here\u2019s why. If you listen to Robert Johnson, you\u2019ll hear the classic blues, but this almost sounds academic now. It gets discussed by people in polo-necks with long beards sitting around on late-night classical music radio programmes. The blues I grew up with was Jimmy Page on Since I\u2019ve been loving you. But listen to the first few notes (or buy the book \u2018Led Zeppelin Complete\u2019, which has every note of that solo written out (sadly they stopped doing that for (IV)). Before very long, in the C minor blues, you are hearing notes that aren\u2019t in the scale at all. Page was already playing chromatically. Notice also the way that the really riveting bit (at 0:57) is based on bending, not on playing in the pentatonic, the diatonic, or even the chromatic scale.  The diatonic scale gives you more options to get where you are going, and the Harmonic and, even better, Melodic, minors take you further. You can bend up to the 7th, but if your fingers already know where it is, then you have the option of not bending up to it. You can also bend down to it, by doing a reverse-bend from the major-7th starting on the tonic and then coming down again.  A clarification here: I am not saying \u2018don\u2019t play the pentatonic\u2019, I am saying \u2018do practise the diatonic\u2019. All the notes of the pentatonic are in the diatonic. Practising it gives you muscle memory and audio memory so that you \u2018know\u2019 where everything is without having to think about it. When you come to play, sometimes you will play pentatonic melodies, sometimes you will play melodies that rely heavily on the leading note, sometimes it will be something completely different. The same goes for the chromatic \u2014 unless you want to play Schoenberg, you are rarely going to be playing all of the notes of the chromatic scale, but knowing where they are means you can slip into chromatic playing without difficulty. You can modulate several times in the same phrase without having to change position. ",
