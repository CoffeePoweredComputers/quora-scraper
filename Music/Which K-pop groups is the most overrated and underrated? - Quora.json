            "answer_text": "I rate them overrated/underrated based on their music, of course. Overrated: Blackpink Okay, I\u2019m not attacking Blackpink or anything, this is just my opinion. I think BP is overrated because of their fans (specifically \u2018blonks\u2019 in other words toxic blinks), the bandwagon and YGE. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t deserve the hype or anything, but they are overhyped by their fans. Personally I don\u2019t like their songs, it\u2019s just not my cup of tea. You can call your favourite group/s kings or queens of kpop, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, but\u2026 I think they need something more to prove. Twice Sorry ONCEs, I just really think Twice is overrated. No kidding. Yes, they worked hard and all but their music is not for everyone. Some of their members are versatile, but their music isn\u2019t. They don\u2019t need concepts and all because they are really talented. I hate to say this but for me their songs are pretty generic. Underrated: Aha, we have a ton but I\u2019ll give three. iKON (I\u2019d like to use the word \u2018underappreciated\u2019 rather than underrated) Many of you will probably think \u2018they\u2019re not underrated, they have Love Scenario that topped the charts\u2019. No, they are one of the underdogs. I know many people who don\u2019t like their songs (even though it\u2019s really good and meaningful) and doesn\u2019t like their visuals (because they have the thing called \u2018YG style\u2019 and \u2018YG swag\u2019). They\u2019re not not your typical idol, not the neighborhood idol type either, not the innocent, cutesy idol you are used to (most of the 3rd gen idols tbh) and I think that\u2019s the reason koreans doesn\u2019t like them (Japanese fans are the complete opposite tho) I know many people when you asked them: \u201cDo you know any members of iKON?\u201d Then they will answer Bobby or B.I. and nothing more. They are one of the groups I considered real artists, you know what I mean? They\u2019re from YG, YGE\u2019s well-known for making idols real artists, YGE invests in them not because of their looks but their music. They may not be popular around their country, but I think their music is one the best. EXAMPLES: Airplane - for me this is their real masterpiece. Love Scenario, Killing Me, I\u2019m Okay - three of their best breakup songs. B.i their leader, the main songwriter and also a producer, wrote them. He won an award for that. (p.s iKONICs are one of the laid back and chillest fandom I\u2019ve ever been. Things are just not that good between Inner Circles and iKONICs (from which I am both), but overall we\u2019re good.) INFINITE Oooh, it\u2019s been a long time. I rarely talk about them because I know no one knows them (which is very sad because I really want to talk about them to my friends) and if someone knows about them they\u2019ll just start talking shit. That is one thing I don\u2019t understand. What\u2019s there to hate about INFINITE? I\u2019ve been in to Kpop since 2008 because I grew up with it (I lived with my cousins and they talk about kpop all the time even before I was born, funny but true). I remember watching MAMA 2012 and they really didn\u2019t stand out to me, to be honest, every time there\u2019s a group performing I can\u2019t help but compare them to Big Bang. But in their group, the one who stands out the most for me is Sunggyu He\u2019s my bias and he literally pulled me in their fandom. INFINITE is pretty popular, but I added them here because they\u2019re almost forgotten and their music is underappreciated. I miss them. Day6 When we talk about korean bands, we usually think of CNBLUE or F.T. Island. To be honest, I am not a fan, I listened to some of Day6\u2019s songs and liked Sweet Chaos the most. But I\u2019m adding them to this list because they really are underrated and I think they deserve more. I just want you to know that they are real artists that want to fit in the korean music industry that is full of idols (it\u2019s not a bad thing, alright?) ",

            "answer_text": "Underrated:Male: Think A.C.E or ONF had recent comebacks that didn\u2019t do their abilities justice. Their problem is that their songs aren\u2019t that great. ATEEZ has good songs but i think aren\u2019t as popular as they deserve to be imo but ACE ONF and SF9 are some underrated groups that really get little light. Female: Someone said WJSN or Weki Meki, and i think WJSN are actually pretty popular. Weki Meki is a group I can get behind as being underrated, but a group i think many people have forgotten is Berry Good. The company is kinda mismanaging them, which is sad cause they have 3 really good vocalists. Overrated:Male: I would say BTS, but their work ethic is still respectable, despite their music getting formulaic and uninspiring recently, But the group I\u2019d most wanna highlight as overrated is NCT. Their concept is very messy, they have too many members, poor line division because of that (see cherry bomb, although superhuman fixed that), emotionless performances, clear favoritism from the company\u2026 idk, i think theyre fantastic dancers, Mark is a good rapper, and taeil needs better vocal songs for his abilities, but the group is such a hit or miss for me, and rarely do they hit. Power of SM i guess. Female: BlackPink and Red Velvet come across as quite stuck up in their success. Not a big fan, but you can tell by their performances. They don\u2019t look like they care about their fans and care about creating good music. They\u2019re a successful product generating profit, but it feels so disconnected. ",

            "answer_text": "It is really funny how all answers here are all the same: First of all, no-one is overrated, overrated means being undeserving of your success, and you don't know who really work hard and who doesn't, but I know one thing, no-one will train in a company and take all the pressure if they aren't really passionate about what they do because let's be real no sane person will join this messed up industry if they aren't really passionate, especially the big companies like SM, JYP, Bighit, YG, and CJ E&M, their training is the worst especially SM and YG and once they debut they get alot of attention, yes but alot of hate comes along with attention, these groups suffer as much as the other groups who are from small companies, I will talk about SM since I am the most familiar with them, you think because it's the biggest company out there, that their groups were comfortable and living their lives, SUJU after debuting didn't have money to buy food so Leeteuk took money from Yunho to bring food to the members, EXO only had one kimbap for each member aday for two years until growl became a hit and they were able to have their own money after paying the company their trainee debt so the big companies only invest money in their music videos and albums but the groups are treated like shit, for YG IKON had to compete against Winner to debut, blackpink's debut kept on being delayed for more than a year, and you should see Treasure episode with ODG when they were talking about their trainee days, it was so heartbreaking, JYP and CJ E&M groups are always made out of survival shows and we all know how survival shows are horrible, and for BTS how can anyone say that they are overrated, we all know their story how after all these suffers, you dare to say that they are overrated. For the ones who are underrated, again no-one is really underrated, underrated means being belittled, and Dreamcatcher, the rose, Day6 are the most well known rock based groups and everybody acknowledge their talents if they know them, I bet you have never heard anything bad being said about them all I see are compliments, actually I bet if these groups were the ones who are as popular as BTS, blackpink, Twice, you would call them overrated. So please, BTS, Blackpink, Twice, NCT, Ateez, TXT, etc are not overrated, they are just more popular than your favourites so stop being salty and have a live. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, no Kpop is group is overrated. All Kpop groups work hard. They may not have struggled on the same degree compare to other groups, but all of them strive hard in order to give their best in what they do. It actually depends on how you interpret a group as \u201coverrated\u201d. \u201cOverrated\u201d is defined as having a higher opinion about something or someone that is deserved. Therefore, stating that a group is overrated is entirely subjective. Some people argue that Blackpink is an overrated group. Contrary to that statement, I don\u2019t believe that Blackpink is overrated. Instead, they are overhyped by YGE and their fans. This also include people who use them for clout. The members of Blackpink are talented, they wouldn\u2019t have gotten in YG if they\u2019re not talented. However, YGE seems to limit these girls in unleashing their potential. It would be much better if YG focuses more on improving Blackpink\u2019s weak points. Sorry Blinks, but Blackpink are not yet the \u201cQueens of Kpop\u201d. They still have a long way to go in order to achieve that title. Same for BTS and Twice. They\u2019re not overrated, they\u2019re overhyped. These groups deserve the fame they\u2019re getting right now. They\u2019ve worked hard for it. As for the underrated groups, here are some of the groups that have crossed my mind. (I think I\u2019m contradicting my previous statement regarding the interpretation of being overrated.) Let me rephrase that\u2026 For me, here are some less-known Kpop groups that you need to check out. Dreamcatcher I\u2019ve recently checked them out. I don\u2019t know much about this group yet, but I really liked their concept and music. They are the first girl group I\u2019ve seen to adopt a dark concept. If you like Kpop songs with hard rock vibes in it, then you should check this group out. They are talented.  Song Title: Chase Me  Song Title: Good Night  Song Title: What The Rose Their songs are great, plus they also produce their own music. What I admire about them the most are the vocalists, they have such angelic voices. You should check them out.  Song title: Sorry  Song title: Baby That will be all for now. I\u2019ll try to add more kpop groups soon. ",

For this I'll likely to go with BTS.. Yeah you heard me right.. It's not that I hate them, but I think that they're too overrated to the point if someone loves kpop will be assuming stanning them.. I mean, they aren't just the only kpop idol though.. There still have NCT, EXO, TWICE, BLACKPINK and IKON..  and now for underrated artist.. Well there will be likely to be many underrated one. I mean, have you ever heard about ATEEZ? REDVELVET? ROCKET PUNCH? No right? If you're asking why did I included red velvet there, here is my answer. They might have known whole world right now but that's is not the point. They barely have any contents in youtube plus their promotions weren't that long. Their company wasn't even treat them right at the moment.. Thanks to all of their fans, they get acknowledged.. Andddd their talents also underrated.. So i think it's is okay to include RV as underrated artist here..  If you don't like my opinion, it's okay then.. Just please don't assuming that I hate them.. Don't be childish okay? And please stop the fanwars\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc have a nice day ",

Not hating, but I don't really like their music much neither do I think there's anything special about them. They're just fine. Not too bad but quite overrated in my opinion. Their music isn't quite something out of the world, but Not Shy was pretty good for a comeback. \u2022 LOONA  People may disagree on this with me but I believe that LOONA is also very overrated. Like every third person today is talking about them. I did listen to their music, but I don't think It's something really extraordinary. Underrated \u2022 BVNDIT  BVNDIT IS SO SO SO UNDERRATED! People dislike them for no absolute reason! They are always called ugly and how their voices are husky which don't match the cute K-pop concept at all. I just wanna say they have amazing music, and y'all should try listening to at least one song. You will not regret it. \u2022 OH MY GIRL  I haven't studied about this group much, but I can definitely say that they're underrated. Their music is just so beautiful in simple words. Their concept is something I really love. It's like so magical and mysterious. I almost feel like as if I'm in another world when I listen to their music! They're really amazing. EVERYTHING WRITTEN ABOVE IS JUST MY OPINION. I DON'T WANT ANYBODY ATTACKING ME. YES YOU CAN DISAGREE BUT PLEASE DON'T FORGET TO BE RESPECTFUL. ",

I also think Weki Meki Doyeon deserves more appreciation and fame for her visuals. In terms of overrated, I\u2019d say Blackpink tbh. Their songs never interest me and they\u2019re hyped be to one of the best in everything; but they lack in all departments. They aren\u2019t bad and I can understand why their famous and hyped, but I think with the fame they have their management and the girls should be doing better. Its crazy that Jisoo is the most underrated member, but to me she\u2019s not only improved the most but surpassed Jennie and Rose in terms of visuals, vocally, and stage presence. ",
