            "answer_text": "Depends on the venue. Depends on the what you have to offer and if you have an audience for it. Depends on your \u201cstar power.\u201d A well-known and establish artist playing in a medium to large venue can command a hefty fee for his or her services whereas someone without the clout playing in a smaller venue (but probably as talented as someone more popular) may not earn as much. Concert artists are essentially independent contractors. They have a fee and if the venue can pay it, great. But sometimes, these things are negotiated based on the number of factors: Artist status - a well-known artist can command a fee of a few to several thousand dollars. (This is just a guess). But someone who is relatively unknown may not be able to command nearly as much.The venue manager has to consider whether an artist can fill the venue. Pianists like Murray Perahia or Lang Lang can fill a hall more successfully than someone with little name recognition. Basically, the more tickets a manager can sell, the better. It\u2019s always a risk because managers need to look at projected sales for any event and calculate fees based on these factors which include the price of the tickets, promotional ads, operational costs, etc.So as a concert pianist (or any professional music occupation) you can set whatever fee you want. You can demand an x number of dollars for your services regardless of the place and time. Or you can be flexible with your fees depending on a number of variables. I\u2019m a professional pianist and I play occasional local gigs. Although I have a set fee, I\u2019m flexible (to a point) because I never want to price myself out of a job. It\u2019s more important to play and get some recognition than worry about how much you make. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends. But for most, not much. Lang Lang, Yuja Wang, Jan Lisiecki, Daniil Trifonov, Murray Perahia, Daniel Barenboim, Martha Argerich, and the like are the exceptions, not the rule. The reality is, few people can successfully make a full-time career and a decent living off of performance. Making a living solely as a performer is an extremely difficult, nearly impossible task, unless you are sufficiently well-known to the point of regularly being invited to perform with the top orchestras at the most renowned venues. Many more make their livings as teachers, at schools or privately. ",
