            "answer_text": "There are several possibilities. First, however, you must keep in mind that every pickup has its own output. In general, vintage-style pickups have lower output than modern humbuckers, which have lower output than active powered pickups. However, the possibilities for low output include: Strings. You mention that you have not changed your strings in 2 years. Bad idea - this is terrible for every part on the guitar that is sensitive to string tension, from the bridge to the headstock. In this context, your strings have probably oxidized so much that they have lost their ability to alter magnetic fields. Please change your strings ASAP!Connections. Over time, it is possible that the electronic connections (generally soldered) have failed. This would be a very likely possibility if one pickup were much louder than another. The input jack could also have a shaky connection to the pots and pickups.Pickups. It is possible for pickups to change over time. Magnets can age and get a bit de-gaussed. However, this is unlikely to be a major change. In fact, many players really like the sound of de-gaussed pickups.Pots. The potentiometers that control volume and tone can fail over time. Depending on the failure, this could be manifest as an inability to find an easy midpoint between minimum and maximum pot values or signal loss.My recommendation to you is to first change your strings and take the opportunity to clean your guitar with a lightly damp cloth. If volume is not restored, take the guitar to a good independent guitar tech, who can check all of these issues and set up your guitar. You may fall back in love with that instrument, which will make the investment worthwhile. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t think it is your strings or pickups. I\u2019m thinking it might be in the pots (poteometers). You didn\u2019t sa how old the guitar is. The pot controls the amount of current from the pickups and can be from 0% to 100%. If they have been exposed to high humidity they can carrode and oxidize. That could limit their effect. Try turning your volume and tone knobbs and see if they change the volume and tone from very low or off to very high. Make a note where they stop changing the sound. if it is anywhere before it gets to thee maximum there is your problem. You can try a little WD 40 squirted through an opening near the connectors and move the knobs back and forth. (just a couple drops is all you need) If that helps you know the problem was there. If they work properly you\u2019re good to go. If the sound is still weak you may need to change the pots for new ones. While you have the guitar open you might as well check all the electrical connections to make sure the solder joints are still good. Also check the ground wire which will leat to your bridge post. It\u2019s normally just pushed into the hole before the bridge is installed. The wire could be oxidized (you can clean it with sand paper). Check the cable jack also to make sure it isn\u2019t rusted and the wire solder joints are good. If none of this works then I would take a look at the pickups. Made sure they aren\u2019t rusty and the solder connections are good. By now you should have new strings on the guitar so it should work. Still have a problem? Try some new pickups. Good luck ",
