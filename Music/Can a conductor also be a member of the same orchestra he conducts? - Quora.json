            "answer_text": "Yes, but it isn\u2019t common. In my first orchestral job, the bass clarinet player was also the assistant conductor, and would take the occasional pops concert or educational concert. It would be impossible to be the full-time conductor of an orchestra and also a regular member of that orchestra\u2026except in the case of a conductor who plays as he or she conducts. Before the advent of the modern conductor at the beginning of the 19th century, it was common to conduct from the keyboard (and this is still done in some period instrument groups). So in that case, the conductor is in a sense a part of the orchestra (though not officially \u201con the roster\u201d as a member). There also used to be \u201clight\u201d orchestras that specialized in things like Viennese waltzes, polkas, etc., sometimes lead by a violinist who would also play part of the time (though in more of a solo capacity). And sometimes a soloist also conducts the orchestra from the keyboard or violin, though they are not \u201ca member of the same orchestra.\u201d Sometimes the concertmaster has to step in for a conductor suddenly taken ill. That is extremely rare - most concertmasters don\u2019t know anything about conducting, and there is usually someone else more qualified on hand. I have worked with musicians who decided to give up their orchestral career to pursue conducting. A few of them have been successful enough to conduct their former colleagues on occasion. Strangely enough, several of them have been from the low end of the wind and brass sections - two trombone players, a tuba player and a contrabassoonist. ",

            "answer_text": "I tend to believe that while this could, in some extreme scenarios work to some very basic degree, a concert in which both the principal conductor and their replacement go missing mysteriously at the last minute, should be put off than turned into a disaster. Maybe there happens to be a player in the orchestra who has enough background in conducting (e.g. one who has taken masterclasses in the past), who also happens to have a particularly profound knowledge of all the pieces to be played tonight\u2014and not just their parts, who miraculously is also admired enough by their peers for them to graciously and humbly take commands from him or her. Is this enough? what about the style of conducting or the dozens of cues that the musicians have learned to rely on during the rehearsals? will the poor musicians have to pick up a new sign language on the fly? after all, the emerging conductor surely hadn\u2019t followed every little gesture of the principal conductor while also playing their part. I think you\u2019re getting the point. If you love conducting, go pursue your dream. You won\u2019t get a second chance. ",

In 1886 Arturo Toscanini was 19-years old and was cellist in a touring company performing Aida. He turned up for one performance to discover the conductor had resigned in a huff and his deputy had been booed off the podium. As he had been responsible for rehearsing the chorus he was given a baton and told to go and conduct the opera. He did so, so successfully that he continued as conductor the rest of the season. It helped that he had memorized the score\u2026 In time he became the greatest conductor of his age. But this sort of thing is the exception rather than the rule. (Note: they still only paid him as a cellist for that first season, and it didn\u2019t strike him as odd.) ",

Pinchas Zukerman did this for years as the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra\u2019s conductor on his own concerto performances. In actuality, there were many, many times, when an incompetent conductor was in front of us, that even a group of 90 musicians kept our eyes glued on our concertmaster to get entrances together and cues for tempo.

Except when the piano is supposed to be playing.) Andre Previn certainly did this, and I think Leonard Bernstein did too. And actually I believe Mozart may have been the first to do it, but of course he composed the concertos in the first place as well). Seriously, this works because the piano is a large and powerful instrument that is in any case separated from the orchestra. Come to think of it, Andre Rieu, the Dutch violinist also conducts his own orchestra. It wouldn't really be possible for the larger stringed instruments or anyway if the music isn't a concerto, where at least the soloist stands separately from the orchestra. ",

He needs to make sure that everyone is watching him for the cues. The conductor will usually turn his head side to side to each section of the orchestra or even his whole body to cue the tempos, syncopation, the dynamics, etc of the musical piece. This will be difficult to do if the conductor himself is also in the orchestra. The same thing goes for a conductor of a choir or a chorus. All the members of the chorus need to have their eyes on watching the conductor for cues on tempo changes, syncopation, dynamics, etc.. I hope this helps. ",

If there are two conductors with the orchestra they can take turns between playing and conducting, but if the only conductor were to want to play in the orchestra as well as playing they would have to be at least a front desk strings player. This is because the position of the front desk can be seen by the whole orchestra, and also the bow can be used as a tool to keep tempo whilst playing. You\u2019ll notice that moss baroque ensembles, especially performances of Vivaldi\u2019s seasons, are conducted by the first desk first violinist/soloist. Also *ahem* female conductors exist ",

The exception is with early music with a small chamber ensemble playing. Usually a harpsichord and string quartet. Maybe a flute or oboe. The harpsichordist leads the ensemble, and accompanies the recitatives which are led by the singer. This isn\u2019t done with actual conducting, mostly just head cues from the harpsichordist as he plays. ",
