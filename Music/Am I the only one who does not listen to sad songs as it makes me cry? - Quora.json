            "answer_text": "I don't think you are the only one, if we include me. I don't prefer sad songs too. Any sad song suggested by my friends are often ignored. I can't deal with them. I am a person who never let my emotions out as the reason I've been tagged heartless by many. But sad songs are dangerous to me. Sad mood + Sad song combination \u2026 ? I am doomed..my emotions would start syncing with the song and I would not be able to control my emotions. Rather, what scares me the most is how the other person understands my emotions. I listen to sad songs only when i can't take it anymore and when i am alone to let my feeling out. They are my refuge sometimes(Happens Rarely) Sad songs often hold lyrics which reads your heart out to yourself with rhythm which slowly melts your emotions. Happiness is contagious but sad heart often travels alone. Which is why sad songs become the guide for your emotions to to know what you feel. They reflect the feelings which one hides in his/her heart\u2026 like a Mirror. This is my perception. I wonder if you could relate to it. ",
