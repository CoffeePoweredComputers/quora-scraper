            "answer_text": " Kendrick Lamar is undisputedly deemed to be the greatest rapper in the industry today and arguably one of the best to ever touch the mic in history. At only 30 years old, he\u2019s built a track record unmatched by any of his peers. This Good Kid in a Maad City, has shown us how Overly Dedicated he is to his craft. He\u2019s detailed his rise from a Section 80 environment while teaching us how To Pimp a Butterfly. He continues to mature and become a household name. Just when we think Kendrick can no longer surprise us, he surpasses our expectations leaving us thinking \u2014 DAMN. We can discuss for hours on end how much Kendrick means to the industry. However, when speaking of influence, this is bigger than his undeniable talent. So, I won\u2019t get into his skills, but rather how Kendrick Lamar has changed the way people view Rap today. With all that Kendrick has contributed to the game, I\u2019ll discuss the Top 2 I believe to be most pivotal and influential to the rap game. 1. Reviving The Sport: The Control Verse When Kendrick Lamar, a Los Angelos native, infamously called himself the King of New York on Big Sean\u2019s \u2018Control\u2019, and dropped debatably one of his better verses, he sent the rap world in an uproar.  Over an already mesmerizing instrumental, Kendrick Lamar viciously rapped, I'm usually homeboys with the same n****s I'm rhymin' witBut this is hip hop and them n****s should know what time it isAnd that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big KRIT, WalePusha T, Meek Millz, A$AP Rocky, DrakeBig Sean, Jay Electron', Tyler, Mac MillerI got love for you all but I'm tryna murder you n****sTryna make sure your core fans never heard of you n****sThey don\u2019t wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you n****s Prior to this game-changing moment, the art of Hip-Hop was said to be losing it\u2019s edginess. Everything was sugar and roses between rappers. The rap game fell into a boring cycle of hit song, album release, promo and tour, then doing it all over again. Kendrick Lamar literally brought the entertainment back into the culture. He re-birthed the friendly competitive nature of Hip Hop and Top-5 debates at our local barbershops. 2. Appreciation: Pushing The Culture Forward  Kendrick Lamar cries on stage after being passed the \u2018Torch\u2019 by West Coast Rap legends. 2011. Regardless of race, gender, location, or lyrical ability, every rapper of this generation is a representation of the Rap culture and vic versa. Therefore, as Kendrick\u2019s career continues to ascend greater and greater heights, the genre of Rap is right there climbing with him. I\u2019ll dive a bit deeper. When rappers of former generations speak on today\u2019s Rap, despite their disapprovals, they make it an obligation to applaud Kendrick Lamar. Kendrick has popularly become the Yin to the often criticized Yang in Rap today. He allows those outside of the culture to view Rap in a more receptive way. So when Kendrick Lamar received a shout out from former President Barack Obama, Obama was shouting out Rap. When Kendrick Lamar is invited to Late Night Talk Shows, they\u2019ve invited Rap. When Pop Icons like Taylor Swift call Kendrick Lamar their favorite artist, they are expressing their love for Rap! Kendrick\u2019s success is undoubtedly lifting the culture to higher levels.

            "answer_text": "Kendrick isnt really influential. He has moreso rocked the Hip Hop world and has had some impact due to that. None of his peers are copying and using his lyrical style and instrumental choices. You also have to remember that outside of J Cole, Kendrick\u2019s peers are Lil Uzi Vert, the Migos, Lil Pump, Rich The Kid, Post Malone, Gucci Mane, Future, Lil Yachty etc, so he kinda stands out due to that. He hasnt really changed the game in any way. People were taking lyricism seriously before he came into the game, it\u2019s just that people werent paying attention to anything that wasnt mainstream at the time (young purists and oldheads included). For young purists Kendrick is the god of Hip Hop currently (mostly because they dont actually venture out into underground Hip Hop like they should). But as far as influence is concerned, Kendrick isnt as influential as people think. It\u2019s just that certain things that he\u2019s done in Hip Hop had a lot of shock value. ",
