            "answer_text": "I think it ended circa 1975 and was replaced by some sort of pop/twang heresy that continues to fester and infect the airwaves. There are notable exceptions. I think that Dwight Yoakam has done an admirable job of taking some good old country DNA and infusing his rock and roll music with that. I really enjoy hearing elements of country spring up in Bonnie Raitt songs as well. That's about it though, in my most humble opinion. Nothing comes close to The Carter Family or The Stanley Brothers or even latter greats like the Outlaw Country artists. I don't lament the fact that no one makes proper country music for the masses anymore. There are plenty of acts playing honky-tonks tonight and every night that honor that style and keep that music alive. The state of things in Nashville and Memphis is not conducive to making country music anymore. ",

            "answer_text": "Country music is ignored by some people. But I agree with some comments that one of the big advantages of country music compared with other genres is that you can understand the lyrics and the majority of the lyrics make sense. But it\u2019s more than that. Country music taps into people\u2019s feelings and most of the time makes you happy. Those that say that only old country music is good have just closed their minds off to new things. I have listened to country music for well over 50 years and I have found great stuff and terrible stuff for that entire time. As a general rule, country music is the best music for down to earth people. ",
