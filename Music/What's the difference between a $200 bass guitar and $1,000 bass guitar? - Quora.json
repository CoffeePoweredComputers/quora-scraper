            "answer_text": "As it was well mentioned, wood, electronics, finish, and mechanics. That does not mean a $200 bass is a bad bass. It also doesn\u2019t mean you can get very close to the $2,000 bass for much less. I bought a Squier Affinity Jazz Bass for around $180 (new for sale), my first bass. I love that bass, and I\u2019m doing some modifications myself: Body paint job: I decided to give the bass some personality. About $50 in paint, sandpaper, and others. I have tools, so, I can do the buffing.Mechanics: I changed the tuning machines to original Fender American Jazz ($60), and I\u2019m changing the bridge for a high mass Hipshot Kickass Bridge (another $60)Electronics: Before changing my electronics, I shielded and grounded the cavities and pickups. Humming went down to almost zero. I\u2019m changins potentiomenters, condenser, and I got new DiMarzio pickups. I\u2019m still waiting for the new toys to install them. Around $180.Wood does make a difference, but it\u2019s really minimal in solid body instruments. In fact, some studies say laminated wood (used in cheap instruments) is better than a single piece of wood. Hard fact, we are humans, not dogs, and I doubt most people can tell the difference between woods. More important than the wood is calibration: Keep your neck straight, your bridge calibrated, your frets in good shape. Despite being a cheap bass, I maintained it like it was a treasure. It never let me down. In the end, I\u2019m getting for $470 a bass that could cost in the market around $1,500 - $2,000. Let\u2019s also keep in mind sound has to do also with the amp you use. I might edit this and post a \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d picture once the project is complete. Good luck! EDIT AFTER POST: I need to highlight, the modifications were not a matter of \u201cneed\u201d, but a matter of \u201cwant\u201d. There was nothing wrong with the bass as it came from the factory. I worked great, sound great, but I WANTED more, so I did the changes. No regrets! The \u201cBefore\u201d and \u201cAfter\u201d pictures: Before (brand new, 13 years ago):  After (the paint job was a calamity):  After fixing paing job (no strings in the picture, but you get the idea):  ",

            "answer_text": "just one more opinion here\u2026 The main difference is ease of play and consitancy of sound. A better bass can be set up to have every note at every fret in tune and with a balanced sound. As a bassist for 50 years every time I pick up a cheap bass, I am reminded how hard it is to make it sound good. Yes I can do it but then I'm spending way too much energy on the bass instead of the music. Every studio has a few banger basses hanging on the wall. Usually they have bad intonation and booming low notes and squeaky high notes. I can play them and adjust my fingering to make them sound ok, but then I'm not putting my best thoughts into the music I'm being paid to play. I know many people who buy cheap instruments then rework them into something nice. But that's not the question. if you are considering buying a bass or any instrument, get the best one you can afford. An instrument should pull you forward, not hold you back. To be fair you can buy a $200 bass, have it set up properly for $50, put some good strings on it for $40, get a quality cord and a nice little amp. But then we aren't talking about $200 Many parents buy their kids cheap guitars just to see if they will stay with it. I can barely play their instruments, how do they expect their kids to play them?  \u2026. ",
