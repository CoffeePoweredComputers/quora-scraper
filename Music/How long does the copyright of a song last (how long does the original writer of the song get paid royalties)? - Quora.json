            "answer_text": "U.S. perspective: Copyright duration has changed over the years. Currently we grant new songs a duration of the life of the creator, plus 70 years. The oldest works still protected have 95 years, if they abided by all of the requirements set at the time of creation. In between, various songs that did not abide by all of the requirements may have fallen into the public domain. That has to be examined on a case by case look at the registration and renewal of any given song. Note, that's for sheet music. For audio recordings every song has protection until at last 2064. And then the standard duration will take effect. This is because recordings had no copyright of their own until 1969, and all existing recordings we're grandfathered with 95 years. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on country and if a publisher or songwriter holds the copyright. In America it\u2019s usually the publisher so it\u2019s 95 years from the date of creation (1925 maximum). In most other countries it might only be 70 years from the date of creation or from the death of the last living author. You get paid royalties so long as it\u2019s in copyright and being logged by the local Performance Rights Organization. ",
