            "answer_text": "Haven\u2019t read every one of the other answers, so I may be pretty weak here. Rock music has a beat, a rhythm, a personality and character, not found in any other genre. It moves in stride with one\u2019s heart and promotes the desire to be alive and stay alive and enjoy \u201cnow\u201d for whatever it is. You go to a live rock concert and fail to be one with what\u2019s going on on stage? Then some vital part of you is DEAD. Other parts still function, but they\u2019re plodding along like mules during their final days. Even listening to YouTube, or an LP, or a well remastered CD with an excellent sound system - let me add, listen to some Southern Rock on Pandora - and dance while you vacuum the carpet. If your nature reacts similarly vacuuming the carpet to Bach, to Big Band, to progressive jazz, then you\u2019re of a totally different mindset - not ugly, but just sayin\u2019. You\u2019re different from us rock people. I had a friend who came to visit 30-some years ago and we went to a public but private place to talk, and here comes a J Giles Band song from a nearby restaurant with its in-house speakers turned way up. Believe it was \u201cFreeze Frame\u201d but I may be way off base with memory. My friend says something like \u201cUgh\u201d to music like that. He prefers classical guitar, which isn\u2019t bad, but still coming from a slightly different place. The experience kind of changed how I thought of him. And again, not in a terrible way but just, you know, different. Primitive tribes from several continents dance to a beat not too different from that of the rock music groups. It gets your heart going; it brings out the primitive in yourself; it energizes, subtracts away your negative disposition, the stuff that bothers you, your inferiority complex, your awareness of how damn awful things are - and you\u2019re in the moment with a beat and harmony and rebellion or adoration and off-kilter sounds and amazing riffs that stream your brain into the cosmos. Listen here:   Sad to say that two years after the Beatles invasion I met the wrong guy and we ended up divorced a short time later, but long enough that I missed being part of my own generation\u2019s music and standards. A decade later I met someone who had rock in his soul, buried so deeply that I had to take it as my own or lose him forever. I noticed how Stevie Ray Vaughan and Lynyrd Skynyrd and The Stones and a couple hundred other bands could change his attitude from \u201chate it all\u201d into a trip across anywhere he really wanted to be. And to one of the best guitarists of his era, besides being a \u201cnice\u201d human being, Gary Richrath (don\u2019t miss the last five minutes):  I had to follow. The trip, growing year by year, has been magical - probably no different from another person\u2019s trip into classical music or mantras (that have a place in my life, too) or (ahem) polka might affect another person from another mental place. Different genres of rock are a fabulous realm to explore. One of my favorites, made even more so because of the angst felt by his demise in a helicopter crash, is the Stevie Ray I mentioned earlier. Watch the genius, feel the throb in your heart:  What\u2019s not to love? Add another layer to your appreciation for that special noise by learning about the artist behind it; the likes of Janis Joplin, Stevie Ray, Jimi Hendrix, so many more are gone via their own vices, which contributed to the soul of their music. Try new artists: I knew their music but knew nothing about Georgia Satellites, and now I do. REM? Watch \u201cLosin\u2019 My Religion\u201d with the sound muted and you might not want to hear the music. Surprise! The words and the beat will stay with you a long time, trying to dissect the meaning behind every note, every syllable. Okay. I\u2019ve pulled up enough YouTube videos to make me want to get off Quora and rock on. Just a couple of additions before I sign off:   \u201cIt\u2019s hard to leave when you can\u2019t find the door\u201d - can you argue with THAT? Love ya\u2019ll. UPDATE a year and half later: Don\u2019t know why so many YouTube videos are made inaccessible. No matter, though. I\u2019ve found some more to fill in my favorite Quora answer. Check above, please. (hard to tell if the new post will work this time out, but here\u2019s my try.) ",

            "answer_text": "Because at its best, it's greater than the sum of its parts and a genre that lets every member of a group shine. A good rock and roll band is made up of a number of talented individuals and together they combine their talents to make something great that has further depths to appreciate. As an example this is The Who singing My Generation.    It's brilliant Rock and Roll by four very talented Rock and Rollers. Daltrey's vocals are full of energy, anger and passion and show off his range and power. Pete Townshend plays a mean guitar and fills the song with riffs and fills and plays with Entwhistle's powerful basslines. Behind it all is Keith Moon who is an absolute monster on the drums. He thumps those skins in a way that turns drumming from time-keeping into a complicated instrument of its own. Four extremely talented guys use their abilities to turn a well crafted song into something really special. You can enjoy it once and then appreciate new things on multiple hearings as you isolate the drumming in your ears and appreciate how amazing Moon was.  Compare that to a pop cover by Hilary Duff    It's recogniseably the same song but what is there to love? If you take Ms Duff's vocals out the backing has nothing to offer. There are no recogniseable instruments there and no talent at work, it's just an audio wash designed to provide rhythm and some backing for the singing. Nobody ever got something else out of this song a second time, because there's no hidden depth to appreciate.  I'm not knocking pop, it's fine if you like that sort of thing, but I love rock and Roll because when it's done well I can love the song, the singer, the drumming, the guitar riff, the soloing, the bass groove, the interplay and lots of other things besides.  Rock music, like Jazz, is good on record but often even better when it's live because Rock is moved by inspiration and improvisation. When The Who played My Generation live, they didn't want to replicate exactly what was on record. The band members would be inspired to mix things up a bit, improvise and generally try new things rather than just play the song the same way every night. The song continued to be fresh and interesting even after it had been played a hundred times because it inspired the band to greater things. ",
