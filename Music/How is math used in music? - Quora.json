Fibonacci and phi are used in the design of violins and even in the design of high quality speaker wire. U can see spiral Fibonacci in Monalisa painting and flowers and arts and nature too.

            "answer_text": "Intervals, the relationship between two tones (notes), are a ratio of frequencies. When you hear a chord that is \u201cdispleasing\u201d it is because the ratio between the tones has a remainder. For example an A note is 440 Hz (frequency) and an E note is roughly 660 Hz. This interval is a 5th (in solders: Do->So) which is one of the more pleasing intervals and this frequency ratio is 3:2 On a more fundamental level, the spectrum of tones in western music is broken up into 12 tones and a musician at any given time is doing a sufficient amount of simple math when navigating around a scale. Regarding rhythm, measures are divided into beats which can be further divided into compound subdivisions of the said beat. 4/4 time is a common time signature and counting 1\u20132\u20133\u20134 is done during every measure, but when playing a more complex rhythm, you may have to divide the 1,2,3, or 4 into smaller subdivisions. A common subdivision is a triplet, which is the division of a beat into 3 distinct beats which leaves a \u2018remainder\u2019 that gives the listener the feeling of a \u201cswung beat\u201d A good book to read that has all sorts of interesting concepts regarding this question is \u201cThe Jazz of Physics\u201d by Stephon Alexander Hope this helps!
