            "answer_text": "Old music is, by and large, the music that people grow up knowing because it is widely played in society. New music, by definition, is music that people have not heard before, and about which society has not yet made up its mind. New music is either based largely on the music of the past, such as neo-Romantic contemporary classical music, which is mostly very bad, or it is original, in which case it is difficult for people to hear or get used to. Most new music, also, is very bad, because the old music tends to be the cream of the cream and it\u2019s hard for any arbitrary new musician to compete with that. But ultimately, new music is the only source of growth in musical culture. Without it, we would eventually die of boredom. Only new music can really let us hear who we are, who we want to be, who we will be. But this is often disturbing. Because of this, authoritarian politicians on both the right wing and the left wing hate new music. They want people to stay the same and to do as they are told, but new music makes people want to change, and to do what they feel. Sometimes, people say that new music is dissonant, but the fact of the matter is, except for a brief interlude of 12-tone music in the first half of the twentieth century, and some explorations in microtonality, the harmonic palette has not not usually exceeded bounds first explored by 16th century composers. Sometimes, as with Mozart or punk rock or modal jazz or Minimalism, new music has used only a restricted part of this harmonic palette. I don\u2019t doubt that new music does sound dissonant to some people, but I think the reason is that it\u2019s not what they\u2019re used to, so they hear it in a rawer way. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you Quora Bot for the A2A. I think. Old music (A) and new music (B) are constructs of academics, including critics, and composers and performers and music promoters. If we generally accept both A and B to exist as actual music, then there is no difference. Music has melody, harmony, rhythm and tempo. Just because one or all of those elements changes even drastically does not make it different. Music does grow and evolve, either in an individual or historical sense. You may well counter, \u201cDo you mean there is no difference between Beethoven\u2019s first piano sonata and his last?\u201d and I would counter with, \u201cMy point exactly.\u201d (I know this response is a bit silly. But I like it anyway.) ",
