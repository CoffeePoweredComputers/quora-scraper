            "answer_text": "I may sound bias with this one but I just answered the question that\u2019s being asked honestly. If you like whatever genre that her recent and upcoming songs have and will have, still like songs with lyrics that were wrote personally and intellectually, then you should still listen to Taylor Swift. I remember the first time I heard her. It was played on was in the year 2008 when Love Story one local music channel here in the Philippines. It\u2019s been 11 years and I am still playing Love Story on my phone. I never imagined in my life that I\u2019ll actually listen to a country song \u2019cause personally it\u2019s not my jam. Then from country songs, her songs became country-pop then now it\u2019s all pop songs. But still I\u2019m listening to all of her songs every now and then. Well, that\u2019s just me. But if you think her new songs which were totally different from the early ones and you don\u2019t want those songs and find it crappy then don\u2019t listen. Stop listening. It\u2019s your choice anyway to listen or not. And if you\u2019re looking for a different perspective or angle and wanted to talk about Taylor as a person or as an artist to consider for you to still listen to her or not because of the follow-up question \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d, I\u2019ll tell you the same thing. It is up to you whether to still listen to her songs or not. It\u2019s your personal choice. I might simply answer you with a yes because I\u2019m a fan of hers and I personally think her songs are beautiful but what if for you, it\u2019s not? What if you personally hate it? And what if you just don\u2019t like Taylor that\u2019s why you don\u2019t want to listen to her music as well? What if you once enjoyed listening to her songs and because of the drama, issues and all, you decided to stop listen to her? Should you give it another try and just ignore the drama and stuff? \u2019Cause you might like a song or two. You might find a new jam by Taylor outside the drama and issues you were hearing/reading. Some may point is that she\u2019s overrated, she wrote songs about boys and her relationship but who doesn\u2019t? Bruno Mars wrote songs about girls and his relationships, so did Adele and Ariana, LANY\u2019s Malibu Nights album is about Paul Klein\u2019s relationship with Dua Lipa but they were romanticized and get praises wherein Taylor got hates from everyone and playing the victim. There\u2019s a big chance that her upcoming album will sound like Speak Now and Fearless so we might hear light-hearted songs that we can bop with and sing in the top of our lungs. Again, it\u2019s your choice to still listen to her or not. But why don\u2019t give it a try and decide it for yourself. :)  Thanks for the A2A. ",
