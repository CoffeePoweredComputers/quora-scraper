            "answer_text": "Okay, I'll take a swing at this ... tho my answer is much too obvious \u2026 In 1967, a band you may-or-may-not have ever heard of released an album ... and the second track was a little silly-song, set in a \u2018make-believe live setting', the singer was given a make-believe name ... he was singing about his band-mates, a make-believe band. He was in a band that wasn't performing or anything, just a studio bunch. It was a pleasant song, very pleasant actually ... a happy, whimsical-type song about friendship ... and we (of the era) used to use a line from it as a 'common tag-line' at the time. Then, two years later in 1969, a completely unknown guy recorded the song and released it as a single, and as the title track to an album of the same name. Both the original singer and the cover-guy were from the north of England, from industrial cities about 100 miles apart ... both very likable guys, with similar strong 'accents' from the area. The '69 cover-album only charted around #30(ish) in both the US and in the UK ... the single didn't reach the Top 50 in the US, but it shot to #1 in the UK. I saw the cover-performer on stage twice, at the Eastowne Theater in Detroit right around that time, circa 1970. He was well-known for this song at the time ... he sang a very emotional version of it, with a great organ and lead guitar intro ... and since he gave the appearance of possibly being slightly physically handicapped or impaired, his performance -- standing up while seemingly having a slight issue with keeping his balance and all -- drew heartfelt emotion from everyone in the audience ... we loved it. Turns out, however, that \u2018thing he was doing with his body\u2019 while singing was not due to any disability or ailment whatsoever. He was fine. And he said many times, in explanation, that he\u2019d just \u2018go into a zone\u2019 during a song, and that that\u2019s what would happen \u2026 he was playing \u2018air-guitar,\u2019 and \u2018air-organ\u2019 and \u2018directing the band\u2019 \u2026he was just being in the moment. Here he is, performing the song ... at a little venue called Woodstock I believe (in upstate New York I guess, I've vaguely heard of it) ... 1969.   BTW, DID YOU KNOW: for the recording of this Joe Cocker (RIP, 2014 .. see: Thomas J. Beaver's answer to What health problems did Joe Cocker suffer from?) version of the song, it was Jimmy Page playing the opening riff (that sneaky guy pops up everywhere!), and Page\u2019s friend Procol Harum drummer B.J. Wilson (RIP) was on the drums ... plus esteemed sessions keyboardist Tommy Eyre (RIP, who recorded with BB King, John Mayall, and on Gerry Rafferty's great recordings of \"Baker Street\" and \"Right Down The Line\") created the opening organ riff. On the road, the guitarist was Henry McCullough (RIP, from Spooky Tooth and later Paul McCartney's Wings), and then on the 1970 Mad Dogs and Englishman tour which I saw, on lead guitar was Leon Russell \u2026 and on keyboards the great Chris Stainton \u2026 RIta Cooledge was up there as well, as a backup singer, and her boyfriend Jim Gordon (who later stole\u201cLayla\u201d from RIta) and Jim Keltner on drums \u2026 Chris Radle (RIP) on bass \u2026 the brilliant producer Denny Cordell was having fun as a backup singer as well. Paul McCartney, a rather obscure British recording artist (you may-or-may-not have heard of him \u2026decent musician and all) who wrote the song, said about Cocker's version: \"He was a lovely northern lad who I loved a lot and, like many people, I loved his singing. I was especially pleased when he decided to cover \"With a Little Help from My Friends\" and I remember him and Denny Cordell (Procol Harum's producer, as well as Cocker\u2019s) coming round to the studio in Saville Row (central London) and playing me what they'd recorded \u2014 and it was just mind-blowing, totally turned the song into a soul anthem, and I was forever grateful to him for doing that.\" And here's the original singer, some guy name-a Ringo ... along with that writer of the tune (still good-looking in 2009) ... maybe meeting for the first time ever right here onstage(???), and playing it together!

            "answer_text": "I scrolled through all 94 answers, and there isn't but maybe a handful of original answers here. You have too many of the exact same answers, not to mention the reccuring covers being named that are in no way responsible for making the songs famous. I prefer not to add famous covers to my answer that have been named fifty times already in different answers. I also vow not to add any cover of a famous song just because I like somebody's newer version, since your question wasn't asking for covers of already made famous songs. So, what are some of the best covered songs that have been made famous by other musicians? Well\u2026 In 1986, the vocal powerhouse Tina Turner released a single which featured an original song written just for her titled \u201cDon't Turn Around\u201d. Surprisingly, the song still wasn't made famous even after Neil Diamond covered it in 1992. The band that made it famous was Ace of Base after they recorded it in 1994. This is the famous version by Ace of Base\u2026   Moon Martin sang \u201cBad Case of Loving You (Doctor, Doctor)\u201d in 1978, but Robert Palmer made it very famous in 1979. Here is Robert Palmer making it famous\u2026   Jimmie Driftwood wrote and recorded \u201cThe Battle Of New Orleans\u201d in 1958, but Johnny Horton made it famous in 1959. This is the famous Johnny Horton version\u2026   Lou Johnson came out with \u201cAlways Something There to Remind Me\u201d in 1964, but it wasn't made famous until a band named Naked Eyes recorded it in 1983. This is that version that made it famous\u2026   Percy Sledge recorded \u201cWhen a Man Loves a Woman\u201d in 1967, but it was made famous by Michael Bolton in 1991\u2026   \u201cMagic Bus\u201d was recorded by Pudding in 1967, but it was The Who that made it famous in 1968\u2026   In 1966, Art Reynolds Singers recorded \u201cJesus Is Just Alright\u201d, but it was the Doobie Brothers that made it famous in 1972\u2026   In 1968, Jerry Jeff Walker recorded \u201cMr. Bojangles\u201d, but the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band made it famous in 1970. Here is the version of \u201cMr. Bojangles\u201d that we all know and love\u2026   In 1957, Dale Hawkins recorded \u201cSusie Q\u201d, but Creedence Clearwater Revival made it famous in 1968 with this sound\u2026   \"Angel of the Morning\" was written in the 60s originally for Connie Francis. After she turned it down, two singers by the names of Billie Davis and Danny Michaels ended up recording it in '67. Merilee Rush had some success covering it the following year, but the cover that really made the song famous was Juice Newton's version, which came out in 1981\u2026   When I was a kid, one of my most favorite and beloved songs of the 80\u2019s was actually a cover. A famous cover at that. \u201cI Think We're Alone Now\" might have been originally written just for Tommy James and the Shondells, and even though it became a hit reaching to #4 on the Billboard Hot 100, it was made most famous by Tiffany when she recorded it in 1987, and I played it over and over and over and over again in my Walkman\u2026  ",

            "answer_text": "The best example, for me, of a cover song that surpasses the original is Bob Dylan\u2019s All Along the Watchtower as performed by Jimi Hendrix. Jimi transformed a tight little folk song into an apocalyptic rocker while still paying attention to the words. Dylan\u2019s version of the song appeared on the acoustic album \u201cJohn Wesley Harding,\u201d Dylan\u2019s first album after his motorcycle accident up in Woodstock, New York. The production on the album was spare, almost severe. It featured Bob\u2019s guitar strumming, Charlie McCoy\u2019s acoustic bass and Kenneth Buttrey\u2019s drums. These are Nashville session musicians, so they know how to keep it tight. The last two songs on the album featured Pete Drake\u2019s pedal steel guitar. So , the song has an insistent beat, a simple chord progression and mysterious lyrics that seem meaningful. Bob sings the song urgently. In three perfectly constructed verses and one Bob Dylan harmonica solo the song is over. The song spoke to Jimi Hendrix when he heard it, clearly. He recorded it for his album Electric Ladyland. He kept adding and deleting parts for nearly three months. The final recording of the song is a triumph of mixing as different parts of what he recorded are brought into focus throughout the song. Jimi sings with energy and it sounds like he means it. Jimi gets the song and turns it into a hit rock single that is still played today. The full power of the song is still intact and able to move the listener even now, after all these years. In the booklet that came with the Biograph set, Bob Dylan wrote, \"I liked Jimi Hendrix's record of this (All Along the Watchtower) and ever since he died I've been doing it that way... Strange how when I sing it, I always feel it's a tribute to him in some kind of way.\" ",

            "answer_text": "There are a lot of great answers to this question. Until The Beatles came along, most pop stars (including Elvis) did not write their own material, opting for professional songwriters. Even The Beatles themselves did a lot of covers, especially in their early days. Speaking of The Beatles, how\u2019s this for some trivia? Who is the only other band besides them to be involved in four of the top five billboard songs at one time? If you said The Bee Gees in 1977, you\u2019re right. I bring this up because in 1978, Bee Gees producer had a seemingly great idea: Why not make a movie of the Bee Gees (along with Peter Frampton) singing Beatles songs? What could go wrong? Not to be too snarky, but plenty. I\u2019ve seen the movie once and that was enough for me. Besides the almost Fab Four from above, an eclectic group of rock stars and celebrities were brought in to sing songs. George Burns sang \u201cFixing a Hole\u201d and Steve Martin sang \u201cMaxwell\u2019s Silver Hammer.\u201d Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 12% rating. There were two lone bright spots: Aerosmith and Earth, Wind, and Fire performed two amazing covers.   The movie didn\u2019t do much for the careers of the Bee Gees, Peter Frampton, and most of the other guest artists. But these two covers are as good as any Beatles covers I\u2019ve ever heard.

            "answer_text": "I see a lot of long-haired hippy rock down below. Let me represent Traditional Country Music. OK, let\u2019s begin with a recent hit for Chris Stapleton. Many people already realize \u201cTennessee Whiskey\u201d is a cover of George Jones.  What many don\u2019t realize is George Jones actually covered this song. It was written and originally recorded by David Allan Coe.  Digging back a bit further, Gene Watson is well known for \u201cFarewell Party.\u201d You might say it is his most famous song and it\u2019s considered a franchise song as he does it at every concert. What many don\u2019t know (including me before the magic of the interwebs) is that it\u2019s actually a cover of Waylon Jennings from 10 years earlier.  The next one may be considered a Country Standard since so many big names have covered it. I was playing an open mic one night and we started discussing this song. Some in the loose band thought it was Keith Whitley original. Others said it was Merle Haggard. It\u2019s also been covered by Sturgill Simpson, Gene Watson, Kenny Chestnut, Daryle Singletary and many others. The other players didn\u2019t believe me when I said it was originally Lefty Frizzel that recorded \u201cI Never Go Around Mirrors.\u201d  Finally, Hank Williams was known as \u201cThe Lovesick Blues Boy\u201d because he received so many encores when he performed this song on The Grand Ol\u2019 Opry. (or was it the Louisiana Hayride?) (or both?)  But, this was a cover. Yep, Lovesick Blues was written before Hank was even born and originally recorded in 1925. My apologies\u2026.. It\u2019s the only video I could find.  EDIT: While researching a comment below, I realized that one of my favorite Red Dirt songs is actually a cover. Emily Herring had a hit on the Red Dirt/Outlaw scene with \u201cMidnight.\u201d  Well, wouldn\u2019t you know it. It\u2019s a cover.  ",

It\u2019s said that Dylan feels this is the best cover version of one of his songs ever recorded.  \u201cI Heard It Through the Grapevine\u201d written by Marvin Gaye was covered with success by Creedence Clearwater Revival. In a somewhat counterintuitive move John Fogerty and the boys turned it into a barroom boogie jam-slam. Here\u2019s the single version-  On the Cosmos Factory album the song is extended with a blistering jam. \u201cWithout You\u201d is a Badfinger song. Their version is okay, but Harry Nilsson took it and made it a hit with what many consider one of the best vocal performances ever recorded.  \u201cAin\u2019t Too Proud to Beg\u201d was a hit for The Temptations and The Rolling Stones cover broke the top twenty as well. Mick & Co showed you could rock-up a pop/soul tune and make it work.  \u201cTainted Love\u201d was a big hit for Soft Cell. Thought it was their song did ya? Nope. It was originally recoded by Gloria Jones for Motown in 1964.  ",

This is \u201cjust\u201d a high school ensemble\u2014Poteet High School, in Mesquite, Texas, had a percussion ensemble that just hit Emerson, Lake, and Palmer\u2019s \u201cKarn Evil 9, 1st Impression, Part 2\u201d out of the goddamn ballpark. They did add a guitarist, a synth player, and a damn good vocalist, but an awful lot of what you\u2019re hearing is a bunch of xylophones and vibes. This has long been a favorite of mine.   The Swingle Singers are famous for their renditions of Bach. . .   New Orleans jazz-funk-rock masters Johnny Sketch and the Dirty Notes give the treatment to Rush\u2019s \u201cRed Lenses\u201d. . .   Tori Amos covered Nirvana\u2019s \u201cSmells Like Teen Spirit\u201d as only she could do it. . .  In fact, Tori Amos did a lot of covers\u2014including a whole album of them, Strange Little Girls.

And many others (180 of them) who recorded a song described by Paul McCartney as \u201cthe killer song of all time\u201d. But have you heard of Pete Ham and Tom Evans who wrote \u201cWithout You\u201d as a modest album track for their band, Badfinger? It appeared on their 1970 album \u201cNo Dice\u201d and was never considered worth releasing as a single. Rolling Stone magazine welcome Badfinger\u2019s debut album as \"It's as if John, Paul, George, and Ringo had been reincarnated\u201d. Both McCartney and Harrison, separately, produced some of their songs. Personally, I think this song is probably cursed. Badfinger fell in with one of the few people in the world I would describe as truly evil, US \u201cbusinessman\u201d (possibly mafioso) Stan Polley. A financial statement prepared by Polley's accountants, Sigmund Balaban & Co., for the period from 8 December 1970 to 31 October 1971, showed Polley's income from the band: \"Salaries and advances to client, $8,339 (Joey Molland), $6,861 (Mike Gibbins), $6,211 (Tom Evans), $5,959 (Pete Ham). Net corporation profit, $24,569. Management commission, $75,744 (Stan Polley)\". That was a lot of money in 1971 (equivalent to around $500,000 today). Badfinger - Wikipedia His, well, blatant thefts eventually led to the collapse of the band, and one of those great \u201cwhat might have been\u201d musical questions. Polley was convicted for fraud, unrelated to Badfinger, and was named in Senate hearings as the conduit between (unnamed) organised crime figures and a New York judge. He died in 2009. Stan Polley - Wikipedia Arguments about royalties for the song carried on forever. In 1975 Pete Ham committed suicide. In 1983, Tom Evans committed suicide. Both died poor. \"The music business is a cruel and shallow money trench, a long plastic hallway where thieves and pimps run free, and good men die like dogs. There's also a negative side.\" -- Hunter S. Thompson. ",

Sit back and enjoy. -Ride Like the Wind and Court of the Crimson King by Saxon - they make the Christopher Cross original heavier and Crimson King has metal majesty. They preserve the dynamics of the original -Folsom Prison Blues by Everlast - very faithful yet hip hop style cover of the Johnny Cash song -Alone Again Or - originally by Love, covered well by the Damned and UFO. You can tell that these bands loved this beautiful song. -Beechwood Park - original by The Zombies, covered by Beck. Beautiful. -Border Song by Aretha Franklin, originally by Elton John - she delivers a great cover. So much power! -Triad by David Crosby - originally by Jefferson Airplane. Subject matter\u2019s a bit dicey but the recorded version is Crosby in fine sweet voice and harmony. -Baby Come Back - original by Desmond Dekker, cover by Eddy Grant - strong vocals and rockin arrangement make this a great cover ",

When Sin\u00e9ad cried in the video, it was a real tear. You could feel it, it was touching. \"All Along the Watchtower\" by Jimi Hendrix (originally by Bob Dylan) - was like the song of the decade for me; Hendrix was electrifying, vocal and guitar. I only realized it was Dylan\u2019s composition when I read the fine print. Surprise, surprise.  Ok I know this is The Beatles, but when Joe Cocker came out with it, I was stunned - it was recorded in 3/4 time - a waltz; The Beatles original version was in traditional 4/4 time.  Jimmy Page played guitar, BJ Wilson from Procol Harum played drums, and a gospel choir sang background on this track - the icing on the cake that made the song legendary. When reggae group UB40 recorded and released \"Red Red Wine,\" even they didn't know who the original artist was. (err\u2026 me too). The song was written and recorded in the late 1960s by Neil Diamond (one of my favourite singers).  Lead singer Ali Campbell recalls in the book 1000 UK #1 Hits: \"The funny thing about the song is we only knew it as a reggae song. We had no idea that Neil Diamond wrote it.\" Red Red Wine by UB40 - Songfacts ",

            "answer_text": "Here is an interesting Rolling Stones anecdote. Believe it or not, the Rolling Stones\u2019 debut album was all cover songs, mostly Mississippi blues and early R&R related songs done in their own style.  It was a successful debut. The Stones\u2019 manager at the time was Andrew Loog Oldham. He knew the boys needed original tunes if they wanted to enjoy serious commercial success, so he sat Mick and Keith down at the kitchen table in the house they were renting at the time and instructed them to brainstorm an original song and not to get out of that kitchen until they had finished their collaboration. They did write a deep melodramatic love song, but on review, thought the song a little too, too, how would you say it, delicate - no, uh, sappy? But, they all three recognized it as a potentially great piece of work so they decided to let an up and coming R&R diva have a go at recording it. It was given to Mary Ann Faithful. She made it into a success. The song? \u201cAs Tears Go By\u201d. The Rolling Stones recorded a cover of their own song, after the Mary Ann Faithful cover had made it a hit. How's that for Rock & Roll history? ",

But in live concerts she used to cover songs you wouldn't think a sort of Kate Bush sounding woman would try. At number 2 I would vote her sweet slow rendition of Whole Lotta Love originally (sort of) by Led Zeppelin. Using piano instead of guitar and still having an orgasm. But at number 1 is Smells like teen spirit by Nirvana ( 90s band not the 60s one) Nirvana actually used this song over the PA at the start of their concerts. I was never sure if that was the bands pi..take or if they really liked the Tori version. Her version makes the song even sadder and you don't even realise the guitar riff is missing. Others would include Twist and Shout covered by the Beatles changing the song from singing about a dance to singing about sex and James Taylor taking the lead vocal ( instead of Backing) on Carol Kings , You've got a friend .

            "answer_text": "People have already listed many excellent covers, but I have to point out this one: Love\u2019s cover of the Bacharach/David song \u201cMy Little Red Book\u201d. (I hasten to add that it has nothing to do with Chairman Mao; I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s not \u201clittle black book\u201d, which is the term I\u2019d always heard used for a small address/phone book of potential, um, partners.) Anyway\u2026 during this era Bacharach was doing stuff with groups like Manfred Mann, who performed this song for What\u2019s New Pussycat? (which I suspect people remember more for Tom Jones\u2019s performance of the title song). The lyrics are from the POV of someone who has lost his love and, no matter how many women from his little red book he goes out with, can\u2019t get over her. The Manfred Mann version is full of jazzy chords that give the lie to the lyrics, especially at the end of the chorus, with a dazzling alternating EM7 and CM7 that suggest that the guy\u2019s private jet has just climbed out of the clouds heading west towards the sunset and to his place in Hawai`i\u2014he\u2019s already forgotten whoever the $EXPLETIVE he was singing about. The Love version, though, is minimalist and raw\u2014kind of proto-punk. They simplified the chord progression and stripped the instrumentation down to the bare minimum. Bacharach did not appreciate the changed progressions, and probably didn\u2019t like the discordances they added, but they fit the lyrics. This guy is really suffering. Compare Manfred Mann\u2019s delivery with Arthur Lee\u2019s. Mann croons \u201cThere is just no getting over you\u201d, the melodic line ending with a B smoothly fitting the EM7 and CM7. How different Lee and Love! Lee belts \u201cTHERE\u2019S JUST NO GETTING OVER YOU, O-OH NO-O-O-O\u2026.\u201d with \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cno\u201d intentionally grating against the chords they\u2019re sung over. Bacharach did many great sad songs, most notably IMHO \u201cTrains and Boats and Planes\u201d, showing you can be sophisticated and hurting\u2026. but the original form of \u201cMy Little Red Book\u201d just doesn\u2019t cut it. Arthur Lee and Love made it work and made it great.  ",

            "answer_text": "Maybe someone already mentioned this, but Manfred Mann\u2019s cover of Springsteen\u2019s Blinded by the Light far surpassed the original, in my opinion, and succeeded in making the song famous. Springsteen\u2019s original version came out in 1973 on his first album, which sold few copies and ended up doing nothing on the charts. A few years later, after Springsteen had become famous with Born to Run, other bands started picking songs of his to cover. The Manfred Mann version of Blinded by the Light gave the song a killer synthesizer riff, clean production (something lacking on the Springsteen version), and a few memorable touches of its own including someone banging out \u201cChopsticks\u201d on the piano at one point and a vocal \u201cround\u201d of two voices toward the end. Amazingly, it all worked, and the song became a number one U.S. hit in early 1977. Ironically, this remains the only Springsteen song ever to reach number one, and it wasn\u2019t his version! I was just five years old when the Manfred Mann version came out and I remember loving it at the time (I\u2019m one of those lucky kids whose mom was into rock music and always had top-40 radio on in the 70\u2019s). I had no idea until years later that it had originally been by Springsteen. I think that came as a surprise to a lot of people who hadn\u2019t followed Springsteen\u2019s early career. I like the Springsteen version, too, for that matter. But they\u2019re like two different songs. If you do look for the Manfred Mann version, by the way, make sure it\u2019s the full version, not the version with a couple of minutes removed that was used for the single (a common and annoying practice at the time). I find that the single feels half baked. You need the long keyboard and guitar break in the middle to appreciate the song fully. I\u2019m a big Bruce fan, and I love the Mann version. However, I think a lot of Springsteen fans hate it. To me, a good song is a good song. Sure, the Manfred Mann version added lots of electronics to what had been a \u201cpurer\u201d song by Bruce, and the cover does remove a few verses (there were too many in the original song, I think). For me, the cover just works so well. What did Bruce think of the cover going to number one? Well, another Quora writer was probably accurate in describing Springsteen\u2019s reaction as \u201cbemused.\u201d That\u2019s based on peoples\u2019 misunderstanding of the word \u201cdeuce\u201d in the Mann version, which caused many to think it was a reference to a feminine hygiene product rather than a \u201cdeuce\u201d coupe, as Springsteen had intended. In the video below, Springsteen describes that confusion, then adds, \u201cWhat can I say? The public spoke, and they were right.\u201d To me, this sounds like him acknowledging the cover was better than the original, but that\u2019s subject to interpretation.  ",

It contrasts wonderfully with the sassy Gloria Jones original and the bouncy Soft Cell cover:  Smashing Pumpkins\u2019 cover of Landslide. I don\u2019t think there was ever an official video because the song was a B-side, but it was the standout track from their stellar B-side collection, Pisces Iscariot (probably my favorite Pumpkins \u201calbum\u201d). This one stands out because of what it brought out of the Pumpkins. No Billy Corgan vocal histrionics. No intensely layering. No irony. Pure talent on an amazing song, now a standard covered by many.  Joe Cocker\u2019s cover of \u201cWith A Little Help From My Friends\u201d.

That didn\u2019t happen, but it\u2019s still a gem:  And in the interest of ending on a weird note, my favorite Yugoslavian industrial band, Laibach, covered the whole soundtrack from The Sound of Music.

In 1949, Saxophonist James Moody made a version of a standard song written in 1935, Jimmy McHugh\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m In The Mood For Love\u201d but Moody never played the melody. This composing technique, long used by jazz musicians, is called a \u201ccontrafact,\u201d a legitimate means of reserving royalties to the new melody\u2019s composer. In Moody\u2019s case, the new melody was improvised on the spot in the studio but he failed to give it a new song title. This recording became a surprise hit, arguably Moody\u2019s best known recording. In 1952, vocalese lyricist and singer Eddie Jefferson put words to Moody\u2019s complete performance including the pianist\u2019s solo. This version was recorded by King Pleasure (with Blossom Dearie) in 1954 as \u201cMoody\u2019s Mood For Love.\u201d In the jazz world, King Pleasure\u2019s version became so popular then and into the 1970\u2019s that younger listeners were stunned when they heard the 1949 original by James Moody. BTW, Jimmy McHugh sued for copyright infringement but had to settle for half of future royalties, since the artistic modifications by Moody and Jefferson were considered \u201cfair use\u201d under the contrafact doctrine.

One of my favorite covers of all time is Jerry Williams\u2019 version of Working Class Hero. Where John Lennon\u2019s original gives me the impression of someone who is defeated and cynical, this version is filled with fresh pain and pathos, a fresh wound compared to Lennon\u2019s old scars. When he hits the refrain I get chills every time.  A more internationally well known example is Johnny Cash\u2019s cover of Nine Inch Nails\u2019 Hurt, which many don\u2019t even realize is a cover. Cash\u2019s life experi Continue Reading",

Straight covers bore me to tears, if you are going to be unoriginal, at least add some originality to it. That being said I guess my favorite would be Celtic Frost\u2019s cover of Wall of Voodoo\u2019s Mexican Radio. Some punk covers are fun if they\u2019re done tongue in cheek, like the Nip Drivers cover of Duran Duran\u2019s Rio or the Butthole Surfers mutation of Black Sabbath\u2019s Sweet Leaf called Sweet Loaf.

A cover that surprised me in the best way isn\u2019t a cover of a song turned into another version of that song. But it is a surprising cover and an original song. The cover is an original musical cover of a classic science fiction short story. The combination of genres is really fun. The band Deadmaus created a song all about a chapter in The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury, \u201cThe Veldt\u201d. In case you are not familiar with it, The Illustrated Man is a wonderful and consuming collection of short stori Continue Reading",

If you grew up in the 70s, you do, because their music was everywhere (especially in the first half of that decade), and if you\u2019re like me, you enjoyed their music and didn\u2019t much care that the critics never had much respect for them.

What makes it better is that the choice of song, and the execution, is so random.

From that they wrote the song for her and Lieberman released her version of the song in 1972, but it did not become a hit.
