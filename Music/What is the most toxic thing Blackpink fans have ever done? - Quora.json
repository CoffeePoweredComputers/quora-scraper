[Lemme just put a disclaimer that no one reads: Notice how I said \u2018\u2019Blonks\u2019\u2019 instead of \u2018\u2019Blinks\u2019\u2019. Meaning, not all BP fans are like this, and there are some nice and chill Blinks in the fandom.]  Sis- what has BTS ever done to you? (I read somewhere that the person did apologize though.) Was there seriously a need to remind the person that someone they love is dead? This person thinks that Blackpink is the only amazing girl group with \u2018\u2019real talent\u2019\u2019. \u2018\u20197 rats\u2019\u2019? lmao, you wish. \u2026 Why hate on Momo who is 1000x more talented than you are? (G)-Idle is not a copy of Blackpink, (G)idle is (G)idle, Blackpink is Blackpink. Just because Chaeyoung had a similar hairstyle and color doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s copying Lisa, ya know. This is so, SO disrespectful. Imagine if Tae saw this :( Let\u2019s not forget when some Blonks attacked someone who looked like Rose.  EDIT: Thanks to Marvheen Theodore, I found out that the same user who disrespected Jonghyun also posted this:  Like seriously wth is wrong with Blonks?  To Blonks: Why can't y'all just stan ur damn Pinks and leave other idols/people alone? Adios amigos~ ",

            "answer_text": "Protecting Blackpink of the hate. Like, really, why blinks wants to protect BLACKPINK of the hate? Women shouldn\u2019t be in entertainment and be famous.Blinks, onces, MOOMOOs, reveluv and those fandoms of Girl Groups are so toxic because they want a group of women to be famous, THIS IS NOT CORRECT! Only mes should be famous, not girls. Everytime i see a woman being famous i\u2019m puking, the music is only for men not for girls. That is toxic.  And if you don\u2019t understand i\u2019m being SARCASTIC. Most of \u201cblinks being toxic\u201d is because other people (i don\u2019t care if they are in others fandoms or not, it's irrelevant.) doesnt want that they protect the girls of the massive hate. And it\u2019s not only from Blackpink, another fandoms of girl group or soloist (Western or eastern) has been marked as toxic only because a huge part want to protect women from the hate. It\u2019s so misogynist! Seems like nobody wants an asian girl group be famous, nobody wants a WOMAN be famous; seems like the music only is for man and the woman should be in the kitchen or being \u201cmodels\u201d.  Before you came with \u201cbUT BLINK DO THAAAT\u201d, let me ask you.. Why the f***k you put a blink in a whole bag just because one \u201cblink\u201d is toxic? Can i put you in a whole bag too? It\u2019s hilarious: let me tell you that toxic blink towards other people are not blink because they\u2019re toxic to BLACKPINK too. Learn these: If a fan is toxic with others fans or others idols, they are toxic with their favs too. True blinks doesn\u2019t care about other fandoms or idols (artist), why we would care what your idol doing? Truly, i don\u2019t care\u2026 If the shoes fit, wear it.  Also, \u201cputting in the whole bag\u201d is from spanish, i don\u2019t know if english have a equivalence. ",
