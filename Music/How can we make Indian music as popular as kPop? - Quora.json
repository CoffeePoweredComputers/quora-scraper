            "answer_text": "Indian-American view. I am not the most familiar with Indian music culture, but this is from what I've gathered. Also, I have redone my answer to fit more in line with K-Pop.____________________Westernization Since this is rather self explanatory...I'll keep it short. Westernized beats, melodies, and singing styles. Many songs are sounding more and more western now, so that's good. Though many songs stay un-westernized (which is not a bad thing...I love regular Indian music as well.) Westernized music just sounds more familiar to me, haha. DiversityThere is not much diversity when it comes to Indian music. I think this is due to the fact the majority of Indian music comes from movies and are often involved with love scenes/fantasy scenes. these fantasy scenes lead on to my next point... \"Pop\"! (Most Important)You said as popular as K-Pop. And there isn't much \"Pop\"! when it comes to Indian musican. And by that I mean...as beautiful as Indian songs are, they just are not pop songs. They don't have that catchy beat that infects you and makes you hum it on a loop for days on end. So even without the language barriers it would be targeting a specific audience.With K-Pop they have the pop part down so hard, everything about the sound of their music is catchy, fun to dance to, and down right infectious. So even though it's in Korean you can have fun. (This is also seen with French artist Stromae for his more popular songs) The Artist & The FansBecause most music is created for the film industry (Bolly, Tolly, Kolly...etc) the singers are not up front, it's just fantasy sequence after fantasy sequence. While this is great for a movie it is not great for a musician. A musician has to be up front in center in most cases, there has to be some sort of relationship between artist and fans. If all the singers are are behind the scenes, the actors get all the attention. Producers seem to be a bigger deal in India rather than singers. If you look at K-Pop they have a great relationship with their fans, often on television, music videos, so many gifssss SO MANY! Bi-LingualMany K-Pop songs incorporate English. But it is always more than a few words scattered about...perhaps a whole bridge. And they also work to not have a strong Korean accent during those parts. Just a little dash of it for flavor~ Also, English add-libs. VideosK-Pop videos have a certain style, this is evident in every video. Very art-based and that's their thing. Lot of influences from things in their culture. But also a lot of westernized stuff...dancing...themes...outfits(well K-pop fashion, but I hope you get what I mean)...etc. India has to do the same, it doesn't have to be fashion centered like K-Pop, but it has to find its thing and mix it with westernized stuff. This doesn't mean completely ripping off old/new western stuff. (I saw this very awkward video where this girl was trying to imitate Britney spears in this Telugu video...just...no.) If it's just a copy it won't wow anyone, it has to be a new style that can appeal to both audiences in India and in the global market. Lyrics?While I believe lyrics and their meaning are important (I personally cannot listen to many songs without lyrics except for classical) I disagree with Alvika on the fact that the lyrics have to make complete sense. It wouldn't hurt, for sure. But music does not need a specific language to communicate. That being said, I really hope to see Telugu and other Indian music make it big. I think what would be great is if more Indian-Americans made music in their second language...the best of both worlds thing going on and trying mixing it together. Also...Searching for acoustic covers can sometimes lead to some fun results. Like this artist. And I know these are not pop songs, but I think they're a bit westernized and can help people who can't look past the unique style of regular Indian music do exactly that. (All Telugu songs, also an Italian song to compare to, it's kinda poppy, but not really, just westernized.)    And some Italiano:  ",

It will be distributed'. (I almost lost hopes on Indian music). 3) NO! Crying out in pain doesn't make it classical music. 4) Hua chokra jawaan re.- This song has vulgarity at level 1000. 5) Honey singh songs-some lyrics like 'Koshish nahin karta mein but pat jaati hai khud pe khud.' Oh yeah! You have the AXE effect, don't you. And mind you every song of his has some lyrics like that.   6) Chinta ta ta chita chita. What was that?! Was it music or some music director's toddler gone wild with instruments and his wife threatened to throw him out if he didn't publish it. 7) South Indian music has improved. But there is still scope. Maybe try avoiding drum played like a tabla in almost EVERY song. Like every person with DSLR doesn't become a photographer. Every person with instruments and weird lyrics doesn't make music. For god's sake. Please I beg you let the music be music, not noise. And lyrics be good too. ",

            "answer_text": "The literal solution is in your hands and mine too. 1)Stop supporting bollywood music which is made as a by product of movies to serve as soundtracks for the movie and which is not treated like indepent music product 2)Support Independent artists.There are lot of Independent Rock,Rap and EDM artists in the country and all of them have amazing potential. These artists often are signed to labels who cant do a lot for them or are completely Independent. It is us who needs to buy their music and reccomend these artists to other people in order to make them more popular as well as financially stable. We have already seen how small company idols like BTS have thrived because of their immense hardwork and fans support. ",

It is even worse than the worst Item song ever produced in India....have you ever criticised that ?It's not like am encouraging item songs...but these songs  are what to us what Nicki Minaj or Beyonce are to the U.S. So when they do that, its flaunting / celebration of female power but it is 'item ' number here ?As for the lyrics..songs don't have to make sense always ...as long as the rhythm is good..(  isn't that why you listen to kpop, you don't even understand the language...how do you even know what they are saying ??)So just one advice...please try to learn to accept and appreciate Indian music , or if you don't like it, don't hear it that's it.
