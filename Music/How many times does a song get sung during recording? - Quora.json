            "answer_text": "The average would be half a dozen run-throughs. One of the most common trick, to thicken a voice, is to layer the best take up front as the lead vocal, with one (or two) of the next best takes several dBs lower in level, as to not be too obvious that they're also there. If done properly, it'll sound like there's only one vocal, to anyone who doesn't know about the trick. Now that you know it, try and spot it in your favourite songs :-)  So you need to make sure you've got the material for those two (or three) entire lyrics, none of them phase-correlated: each syllable needs to be from different takes. You can't have even a single syllable be a duplicate from the other two takes, as the thickening effect would collapse). And then, you more than often have harmonies in the chorus, which are also better if you've got two (I do 4) so you can pan them either side. Count an average of two hours at least for a standard 3-5 min song.  This would be considering the artist has no problem whatsoever with pitch, elocution, etc. I've had singers who realised, once in the studio, that some of the lyrics they had written just couldn't fit!!! Too many syllables in some places... goes to show you how well they rehearsed ;-) But then, as others have noticed, you've got the odd artist where you better have your levels set within seconds, as they'll hit you with a one-take wonder!

            "answer_text": "However many times you can fit into the session. If you have your own studio, fair enough you could record it as many times as you want. However, most people don't have their own professional studio so they have to hire one out OR the label hires one out for you to record in. Commonly, you will have about an hour slot to record because of budget and time constraints. If you work for a label, they ain't paying any more than they need to so you'll need to get in the studio with the song already rehearsed and then have several recordings done by the end. If you don't record a song that sounds good enough to be sold, the label may book you in another session but they'll be understandably angry. Screw it up a second time and you'll probably be out for good. You'll get about 40 minutes of recording time whilst the other time is spent getting ready and getting the levels right. You'll probably get one play through before recording whilst they're sorting out the levels. Now if you're paying for a studio out of your own pocket, you'll have as many sessions as you can afford. Paying for good recording studios can be expensive which is why most people only book an hour to get the song recorded. ",
