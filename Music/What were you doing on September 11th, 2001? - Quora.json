            "answer_text": "I was in my second period English class, on the second day of high school at Stuyvesant, two blocks away from the towers. We heard a loud, muffled explosion, and a chorus of car alarms going off. I assumed that a truck had collided with something, but then a classmate sitting next to the windows shouted \"Holy shit, someone bombed the World Trade Center!\" I thought it was a joke, but then we looked outside. We were glued to the windows. There was a giant smoking black hole in one of the towers. When we got back to our seats, I pulled out the brand new day planner I'd bought for school, and started writing down what was happening and at what time.  I remember realizing that this was something huge, and that I wanted to chronicle it - though I was so disoriented by what was going on that I had written the date as \"5/11\" instead of \"9/11\" initially. It was surreal. A part of me felt like I was writing this down because it's what I was supposed to do. (When I get home I'll try to dig up the planner and update this answer to transcribe exactly what I'd written.) After a few moments, the principal came on the loudspeaker, and announced that a \"small plane\" had accidentally crashed into one of the towers, and that we were safe, and that class should continue. I remember the words \"small plane\" and \"accidentally\" - and I remember thinking immediately that this could not possibly have been an accident, especially if the plane had been small. The teacher, who was in her third trimester of pregnancy, tried gracefully to return to the lesson. We were supposed to discuss lullabies we cherished from childhood, and it seemed somehow appropriate, or important, suddenly. Then the second plane hit the south tower, and we were once again at the windows. The teacher didn't even attempt to return to the lesson after that. I don't know if she was too shaken herself, or if she simply knew it would be futile - or if the lesson just wasn't on her mind anymore. The principal once again came on the loudspeaker after a time, and announced that another \"small plane\" had collided with the tower. We were still safe in the building, he assured us, so we were to remain with our regular class schedule. In my planner, I wrote down the time that he made the announcement. At Stuyvesant, we had a long school day consisting of up to ten roughly hour-long periods - though students didn't necessarily have classes during all ten of them. Normally students were allowed to wander during their free periods so long as they didn't disrupt classes. The principal announced that in light of what just happened, this privilege was being suspended: For the rest of the day, anyone with a free period must report to some classroom - presumably so that everyone could be accounted for and supervised in case anything worsened. The bell rang, and we went to our next class. Our school was crowded, and I was new, but the hallways still seemed even more crowded than they should have been - as if more students had spontaneously appeared just to talk about it. My next class was math, third period, on the second floor, facing south - toward the towers. I had been assigned to put up the previous night's homework on the chalkboard at the back of the classroom while the teacher prepared the lesson on the chalkboard at the front (such are the woes of having a last name at the front of the alphabet in grade school). I hadn't actually done the homework, so I started trying to do it on the spot, hoping the teacher wouldn't notice. The teacher looked out the windows, and saw a flock of news vans driving toward the towers. Our classroom had a TV in it, so he had us sit down so he could turn on the TV and learn more about what was going on. The instant he turned on the TV, the lights went out and the building shook. Most people screamed. I remember vividly that one girl didn't. She didn't even look toward the windows. She kept facing straight forward, and just collapsed onto her desk and started crying, like someone had just pushed a button to make her do that - or like something in her lost power exactly when the building did, and that was her body's reaction. While other students ran to the window, I went up to her - I was still trying to figure out what to do, trying to make sure I was doing what a person was supposed to do, during whatever-was-going-on - and tried to comfort her. I remember her telling me that she had an uncle in the World Trade Center, and I was instantly disarmed. I had no idea what a person was supposed to do at that moment. I was 13. Moments ago I had been worried that the teacher would find out I didn't do my math homework from the first day of school. I went to the window with the others. On the street, I saw people running north - away from the towers. I remember seeing men and women in suits and professional clothing running, backs straightened with panic, ties and skirts and blazers flapping behind them, some of them throwing their briefcases away as they ran. Behind them, a thick gray cloud of debris rolled through and over the buildings.  I wrote down the time that I saw it. I wrote down the time that the debris reached us, and we could no longer see through the windows of the classroom - as though they had been painted gray. The lights and announcement system came back on. The principal announced that one of the towers had fallen. It was no longer safe for us to remain at the school, so we were to report to our homerooms for teachers to do a headcount and prepare to evacuate. We were shoulder-to-shoulder in the hallways. Some people were crying. Some people were cracking jokes. Some people were panicking. No-one was quiet. In my homeroom, all of us were trying our cell phones - no-one's worked.  Our school had students from all over NYC, and affordable cell phones were just becoming popular, so most parents whose children had to commute to get to school had given their kids cell phones in case of emergencies. Now that we were in such an emergency, they were useless. The irony didn't register at the time; I was just mashing buttons on my phone constantly, trying anything to get it to work and get in touch with my parents who also worked in the city. I stopped writing what was happening in my planner. Other things were now more pressing. The evacuation began. At first, it proceeded like a fire drill - we were gathered in groups and marched toward the exit as orderly as we could manage. The largest entrance/exit was in the lobby of the school on the ground floor, so that's where we were headed. In retrospect, I'm amazed that the faculty was able to keep things as organized as they did. I just reached the bottom of the staircase leading down the lobby and turned to go outside when the building shook again. There were what appeared to be police in riot gear holding the doors open for students to exit. They were waving students back in, as the students who just evacuated fled back into the school, heads down, the cloud of debris from the second tower chasing them. I remember seeing the officers (for lack of better term) at the door lower their face shields, and shut the door just as the last students got back in - and then the cloud of debris hit and I couldn't see them outside anymore. The faculty re-routed the evacuation to another exit on the other side of the building. Our school was on the water right by the Hudson River. When we got out of the building, we were told to walk north, up the pedestrian walkway between the West Side Highway and the river. There were no other instructions. Just get away from ground zero. Students huddled together with friends, or around someone with a radio, or around someone crying who needed help. Groups of students with radios were saying all sorts of things. Some said the Pentagon had been attacked. Some said that California had been attacked. It sounded like we were at war. The world suddenly seemed far larger, and I had the distinct impression of being lost in it, like I was in open water at sea, at the mercy of currents too big for me to see or resist. I wondered if my home would still be there. I wish I could say I became animated by some great bravery or calling to rush to help others, but the truth was I was just a terrified and confused 13-year-old, who couldn't even think of anything to do beyond \"keep walking\". One teacher had climbed onto a box and was standing there, almost preaching to the passing students - except I didn't hear him talking about God, or anything like that. He was shouting that we would find whoever did this and get them. That particular teacher had looked disheveled before, but at that moment he was indistinguishable from the type of crazy guy you might see standing on a corner any other day. A group of kids in front of me had their arms around a girl who was crying. She thought I had said a joke or something, I don't remember, but she turned and yelled at me and I couldn't understand her through the tears. I tried to say that I didn't say anything, but her friends shut me down, and then they turned and walked forward again. I happened to have found friends - one of whom I had known from before high school - who lived in the same neighborhood as I did, and we stuck together. We all just kept walking north, up the river. Sometimes we would turn and look back, at the impossibly large cloud that had swallowed the entire skyline in white. After hours of walking, we passed by some tables that had been set up by what seemed to be the Red Cross. They were handing out plastic containers of ice water (the kind you get take-out Chinese soup in) to groups of us - it was a hot day. My two friends and I shared one. We kept walking. Eventually, my father found us in the crowd. He and I were both trying our cell phones, but he literally bumped into us. He explained that once the towers fell he ran to the school to get me. Now that he had found me, we were going to get my mother from her office further uptown, and then walk back across the bridge to Queens, and eventually home. My friends hadn't heard from their parents yet, so they came with us as we walked across Manhattan. Dad got us some fruit from a stand - we hadn't had breakfast - I don't remember if the guy at the stand charged us or not. On street corners, more people had stopped to shout. They didn't look like crazy people; they looked like normal people. I remember seeing a professionally-dressed middle-aged black woman with a smart hair cut, looking overall collected despite what was going on - she could have been on the cover of a business magazine. She was standing on top of a newsstand, with her briefcase propped up beside it neatly (almost as if this, specifically, was her job), hollering at the top of her lungs that Christ was coming, and it was time to repent.  We passed many like her on the way to my mother's office, which was near the Queensboro Bridge. The subway system in Manhattan was, of course, shut down. We were going to walk back home. We weren't the only ones crossing the bridge on foot. Traffic was at a complete standstill, and there were enough people evacuating on foot that we were just walking in the middle of the road, between cars. Some people climbed on top of cars or trucks to lie down and rest. When we got off the bridge in Queens, there were tables of people handing out cups of ice water again - except this time, they were being provided by the mayoral candidates in the upcoming election (the people handing them out told us). The subway system was still running in that part of Queens, and was made free for that day. The station at Queens Plaza was packed like you wouldn't believe, but the crowding didn't feel uncomfortable at the time. It just wasn't on my mind. After we finally got home, all I remember for the rest of the week was watching the news, virtually non-stop. Once we were far enough away from it all, we could get some information about what had happened - as though it wasn't just cell phone signals that were lost in the vicinity of the towers, but communication altogether. Over the next several days, we learned that the planes were commercial airliners, that they were hijacked by religious fundamentalists, that a man named Osama bin Laden was responsible...the rest, as they say, is history. I remember watching the death count fluctuate wildly each day as more information coalesced. That weekend, we tried to celebrate my birthday. I don't remember what we did that year at all. At some point, we finally received word from our school. The building we were in, due to its facilities and proximity to the towers, was being used as a hub for the rescue workers, so we couldn't return yet. The city had worked something out with another large high school in Brooklyn, where their students would have half days, and we would come in for the other half. There's more I could say about what that was like, about all of freshman year, and about graduating high school as part of \"the 9/11 class\" - the last class of students to have personally witnessed the attacks. I even worked on a documentary piece about it. But those are other stories.   Edit to answer: Thank you very much for the kind comments, though I feel as though I can't or shouldn't accept them - my story is just one of many that day. For those who would like to hear more stories from more of us who were just starting high school that day, two blocks from ground zero, I want to recommend two sources: One is our high school newspaper (appropriately enough named \"The Spectator\"), which ran a special issue following 9/11 which was later circulated by the NY Times (the issue itself was composed 100% by students of the high school). As of 9/11/2013, you can access a free copy of that issue online, here: The Stuyvesant Spectator - 9/11 Edition Additionally, one of the teachers at Stuyvesant who was also present that day later compiled several students' accounts into a book, which you can purchase here: With Their Eyes: September 11th--The View from a High School at Ground Zero: Annie Thoms: 9780060517182: Amazon.com: Books ",

            "answer_text": "When the planes hit, I was asleep in my apartment in Park Slope, Brooklyn. I had worked a second shift the night before and went to sleep around 3 am. Shortly after the first plane crashed into the building at 8:46 am, my phone started ringing, I ignored it and kept on covering my head with my pillow. But the phone kept on ringing incessantly. I finally climbed out of my loft bed, did my business in the bathroom, and then looked at my answering machine light blinking. I pressed play to listen to my messages, and it was my mom saying stuff like \u201cMichael, please tell me you\u2019re all right, please call\u201d. I listened to more messages and it was all my mom\u2019s plaintive voice. As I was about to call her and ask what was going on, the phone rang again. It was a former neighbor who wanted to know if I had heard and she let me know what was happening. I got off the phone with her, and tried to call my mom but I got a recorded message telling me all circuits were down and to try again. Just then my mom called again, gratefully yelling \u201cTHANK GOD YOU\u2019RE ALL RIGHT!\u201d To explain the concern, I worked as an on-call legal proofreader through temp agencies and was dispatched to work in word processing centers at various corporate law firms in Manhattan, often on the graveyard shift. One of the firms that I sometimes was sent to was Brown & Wood LLP (which around that time merged with Sidley & Austin). Brown & Wood\u2019s word processing center was located on the 59th floor of Tower 1 of the WTC. I had temped there on and off over the previous year, but hadn\u2019t gone to work there for a while. That whole summer work was slow and I hadn\u2019t been called in for many assignments anywhere. But the week prior to September 11th, work was picking up and I was sent to Brown & Wood three times that week. So I worked there last on Sunday night into Monday morning, the 9th of September until the 10th of September, from 11 pm to 7 am. I had happened to mention to my mom that I was getting sent to some jobs at the WTC, so of course she assumed the worst. On Monday evening I had another assignment at another firm through another agency in Midtown Manhattan from 4 pm to midnight. At around 10 pm, the agency that sent me to Brown & Wood beeped me on my pager (remember those?). I called back and they asked me if I wanted to do another 11 pm to 7 am shift at Brown & Wood, I was tempted because I hadn\u2019t worked much that summer but I was also tired and grumpy and was looking forward to taking the free car service back home. Of course, if I had taken the assignment I would in all likelihood have survived, as the impacted floors were above Brown & Wood. Everybody from the firm except one person made it out alive (as I understand it, she was arthritic and/or asthmatic and had difficulty making it down the stairs and was waiting to be evacuated from the building by rescue personnel and was caught in the collapse). As I was talking to my mom and assuring her I was all right, that I didn\u2019t work at the WTC that day or night and I was safe in Brooklyn, I turned on the TV to see if I could get coverage of what was happening. But as I didn\u2019t have cable and the main broadcast antenna was on the WTC itself, all I got was snowflakes. I walked over to the window, and pulled up the shades and I saw plumes of smoke coming out of the towers, but both were still standing at that point. I remember exclaiming to my mom that I could see the towers burning. Then I remember the line went dead again. Figuring this was something I was going to be staring at all day, I decided to go and take a shower and get dressed, go outside, buy a coffee and cigarettes, etc. and also buy a disposable camera. (I had no cell phone and cell phones generally had no cameras in those days yet anyway.) I went down to the corner Pakistani-owned bodega to get these items and people were excitedly talking about what happened. One guy said something like: \u201cA plane crashed into the Twin Towers, it was a terrorist attack and they fell down and destroyed all of Lower Manhattan!\u201d I probably smirked and told him something like \u201cCalm down, dude, yeah, a plane crashed, maybe it was a terrorist attack, yes, the buildings are on fire, but but I can assure you they\u2019re still standing, I saw it with my own eyes\u201d. Well, he was right about everything except the destruction of all of Lower Manhattan. I bought my cheapo disposable camera and went up to the roof of my building to see what pics I could take of this historic event. There was already a crowd gathered. I remember opening up the trap door and poking my head out and there was already someone there right next to me filming with a video camera. I said something like, \u201cWow, I can\u2019t see the Twin Towers.\u201d I remember him wordlessly turning and looking at me, and then pointing his camera back at Manhattan. The whole skyline was obscured by billowing white plumes of smoke at this point. I walked over and spoke to a young woman on the roof of an adjacent building and she filled me on the details of what was known at that point. I still couldn\u2019t digest the fact that the buildings had fallen. I kept on saying that I had seen them standing just 45 minutes or so ago. I went back downstairs and walked outside. Powdery ash was beginning to fall, soon the parked cars were covered in what looked like a light snow flurry. I started walking around the neighborhood in a daze. I have a vivid mental image of a young, pretty Puerto Rican- or Dominican-looking woman standing at a pay phone with tears streaming down her face. I circled back to my apartment building, which was on 4th Avenue. Soon, there was a march of bedraggled people walking in the middle of the street down this normally busy thoroughfare, which was usually a motor speedway. These were the refugees who had escaped Lower Manhattan, and had fled by foot across the Brooklyn Bridge. I remember one guy said he lived in Queens, I asked him why he was coming to this part of Brooklyn, he said he just wanted to get out of the city as the buildings were coming down and ran with all the terrified people over the Brooklyn Bridge. Zaman, the Pakistani corner store guy was passing out bottled water to people and told me to help him. Soon he was out of everything. I eventually walked back to the other side of the neighborhood, where I had moved from a few months before and hung out with some friends over there and watched the coverage on their cable TV. I wish I could say that I was inspired by this experience to do something heroic, got involved in rescue and recovery efforts, joined the Marines, get involved in some kind of activism or something. I guess I got married to someone I shouldn\u2019t have in part due to 9/11, though, thinking that I should take a leap because you know, life is short and all that, so it did have that life-changing aspect.
