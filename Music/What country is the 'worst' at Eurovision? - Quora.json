            "answer_text": " I'm Sorry, It Has to be Andorra. Andorra Never Quitfied for the Final, And That It's Funny That It's the Only Eurovision country to Not Quifty. Before Andorra's Debut, The Andorrans Used Either the French or The Spanish Station to Watch Eurovision. That Andorra hasn't Participated in Eurovision ever Since Their Last appearance in 2009. As of 2020, Andorra is the only country to have participated in the contest without appearing in the final. The best the country has ever done was in the 2007 contest, where it finished 12th in its semi-final and did not advance to the final.  But If you Meant the Worst Country In your Opinion In Eurovision than it has to be the smallest Country in All of Eurovision. . . San Marino  San Marino always send Corny songs Like For Example *Cough* *Cough* Chain of Lights *Cough* *Cough*. They send Silly songs Rather than serious songs. One of My Favorites Was 2008, I really Liked Their Debut. . . But they were soo Robbed, They Look the Last Place!? Below Estonia? Grrr! \ud83d\ude21 San Marino was always one of the most childish Eurovision countries, Compared to their Older brother Italy. I also liked Ciralie (Vola) And that It should've Quitfy instead of Armenia! It was also my favorite Non-Quifter. The rest were so Corny, and the beats And Staging are so cheap. I bet freaky's stage chould've just look some free Wallpaper up on YouTube and use it as a staging if it wasn't Cancelled. ",
