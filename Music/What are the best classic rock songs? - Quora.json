            "answer_text": "As almost everyone else who has answered has said, it is virtually impossible to objectively and definitively answer which is the best classic rock song of all time. That said, the following is a list of 10 songs (in no particular order) that are consistently ranked at the top of lists of greatest classic rock songs of all time: Stairway To Heaven - Led ZeppelinFree Bird - Lynyrd SkynyrdRoundabout - YesMore Than A Feeling - BostonAnother Brick In The Wall - Pink FloydBohemian Rhapsody - QueenCarry On Wayward Son - KansasDream On - AerosmithPurple Haze - Jimi HendrixLayla - Derek and the DominoesEven this list seems somehow inadequate to me, so here are some additional \u201cHonorable Mentions\u201d that might also qualify as the best classic rock song of all time: All Along The Watchtower - Jimi Hendrix Baba O'Riley - The Who Won't Get Fooled Again - The Who Walk This Way - Aerosmith Sweet Emotion - Aerosmith Kashmir - Led Zeppelin Black Dog - Led Zepplin Smoke On The Water - Deep Purple The Chain - Fleetwood Mac Rock And Roll All Night - KISS You Shook Me All Night Long - AC/DC Wheel In The Sky - Journey (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction - The Rolling Stones Got To Get You Into My Life - The Beatles Hotel California - The Eagles There are certainly other songs worthy of inclusion here; this is a subjective list which reflects my own opinions and biases on the subject of great classic rock songs. YMMV. ",
