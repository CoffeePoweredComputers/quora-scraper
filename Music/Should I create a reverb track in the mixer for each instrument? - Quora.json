            "answer_text": "There are different kinds of reverb for different purposes. You don\u2019t have to choose between just two options, using only one reverb, or having a reverb for each. That\u2019s not the point. The point is to use your reverbs efficiently and not assign a customized reverb setting for each track. Here\u2019s an example. I have a full band neo-retro song: drums, two guitars, bass, and a vocal. I\u2019ll use three reverbs. The two guitars, I\u2019ll send to Reverb 1, which longer tails to get that big 80s guitar sound. The vocal I\u2019ll send to Reverb 2, with a shorter tail and a brighter response, to give it air. The whole drum group I\u2019ll send to Reverb 3, which is a medium sized room reverb, because I recorded it in a small booth and I want some air into it. That\u2019s three reverbs for 10 tracks. The point is that I don\u2019t have a hall reverb for guitar 1 and a spring reverb for guitar 2 and a digital reverb for vocals and a studio room reverb for the overheads and a gated hall reverb for the snare and a short tailed reverb for the kick and a large square room reverb for the toms and a long tailed reverb for the hi hat. That\u2019s 8 different reverbs that will muddy up your sound. ",

            "answer_text": "What I usually do is, I make a bus track for reverb, then I route it to the tracks I want it on..rather than insert the verb plugin on them seperately. Be sure to make the reverb track 100% wet. I use that bus track for all the instruments. For the main vocals, I apply the reverb via plugin directly on the track so i have more control of the amount used . I do the same with compression..depending on the need for it of course. But I find that I use compression on about 90% of my tracks. It's one of those tools that once you learn how to use it properly, it can do wonders. Reverb is another, to a lesser extent. The beauty of applying it from a bus is having a master fader to control the amount..and if you use automation, it can really add to the depth in the sections that need it, and fade or disappear completely in the sections that don't. Using reverb is one of those heavily debated effects...some love it, others hate it. Me, I love a good plate verb..especially on vocals. But there a few great free reverb plugins out there too. Same goes for just about any other effect and even some instrument plugins too. Lord knows there is no shortage of free plugins floating around. Take advantage, sample every one you find, you may be shocked at the quality of some...and appalled at a bunch too lol. ",
