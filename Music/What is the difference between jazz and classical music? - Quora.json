            "answer_text": "The differences between Jazz and Classical are numerous and could not possibly be fully covered in a few sentences. I will therefore cover only one point of difference which to me is of significance: the time frame within which each discipline has evolved. If one includes the medieval period, then classical music can be traced back as far as the year 500 AC. However, most of us would understand classical music to begin with the Renaissance era (1400 to 1600) and then the Baroque (1600 to 1750), the Classical (1750 to 1820), the Romantic era (1810 to 1910), and finally the 20th century Classical music. This time frame alone affirms \u201cClassical music\u201d as the supreme music of our Western European traditions. Over 600 years of traditions and conditioning have turned what was once popular music of the time, into revered Art music. Let us now compare this with Jazz: Its genesis is generally accepted to have taken place during the last decade of the 1800s (around 1895). Ragtime / Blues and Dixieland (1895 to 1920), Trad Jazz and also the beginning of what was later called symphonic Jazz (Gershwin) would emerge from 1920. The Swing era began in 1930 with the apparition of some of the most famous Jazz Big Bands (Duke Ellington, Count Basie and Benny Goodman to name a few), and was promptly followed by the Bebop era of the 1940s (Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Theolonious Monk, etc\u2026), then by the hard Bop era of the 1950s (Cannonball Adderley, Sonny Rollins, Clifford Brown) and the Cool school era (Miles Davies, Dave Brubeck, Stan Getz); the early 1960s saw the birth of free jazz (John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Don Cherry); Latin Jazz (Tito Puente, Antonio Carlos Jobim) and Fusion (Miles Davis, Weather Report, Herbie Hancock, Frank Zappa) would then appear on the scene from the late 60s and the 1970s. The Jazz rock and Funk movement (Joe Zawinul, Chick Corea, The Brecker Brothers) would cover the 1970s and 80s), followed by Smooth Jazz (Grover Washington, David Sanborn, Dave Koz), Acid Jazz and Mbase (Donald Byrd, St Germain, Steve Coleman) would conclude the century. From 2000 onwards no one style has dominated any other. Jazz has therefore developed over a period of time that is significantly shorter than Classical music (about 120 years versus 600 years). Over these 120 years Jazz has nonetheless covered musical grounds that are staggeringly impressive. Jazz has earned its stripes and, just like Classical Music, is now regarded as Art music of the highest degree. Some people will argue that Classical music is really serious music when Jazz isn\u2019t based on the simple fact that Classical music is so much older than Jazz. This could not be further from the truth. Both musics are worthy of regards and appreciation. Both musics deserves study and respect. Both music have differences but also many parallels and similarities that cannot be ignored. Let us all enjoy the beauty to be found in music as a whole. ",

            "answer_text": "Zach\u2019s answer mostly covers it, but there are a couple of crucial things I want to add. Classical music was, make no mistake, a Eurasian invention, while jazz was Afro-European\u2014in other words, American. Classical music had been around in Europe in some form or another since the Middle Ages\u2014although the classical styles we recognize really didn't come around until the 17th century. Jazz, on the other hand, has its roots only partially in classical music, and originated during the 20th century. What birthed jazz came largely from the slave population (who, by the time jazz came into being, were largely still working for free through sharecropping) in the form of spirituals and blues. The more intricate rhythms of jazz were, by that time, commonplace in Africa. Tonal music was largely a thing of European society, and so, while the 12-note system that we commonly associate with Western music, including jazz, did come from classical music, these sultrier, warmer harmonies were a byproduct of unfortunate circumstance. It was a different sound of music, meant to convey a very different situation. It was in New Orleans where the initial phases of transforming blues into what we understand as jazz occurred, with styles like ragtime (which was reminiscent of some classical composers like Chopin) or Dixietown. Essentially this new mode of music was taken and combined with European instruments. Guys like Louis Armstrong were pivotal here, and bandleaders like Duke Ellington and Count Basie carried it into the big band era. There are two major tenets of jazz: the swung 8th note and improvisation. In recent years as more forms of jazz fusion have arisen, many musicians have moved to a straighter 8th note approach, but we can still identify these tunes as jazz because of the denser chord structures. Jazz was a critical part of black expression in a newly emancipated America (jazz in the Roaring 20\u2019s largely reflected unyielding optimism in the face of despair) and, as America changed in response, so did jazz. For example, in the 40\u2019s there was a large step away from traditional big band styles, because many black performers wanted to be taken more seriously, and therefore began to play jazz faster, with more chord changes, and unparalleled virtuosity. (There was a \u201ccounter movement\u201d of sorts later on called modal jazz.) Besides origins and societal importance, there is also the matter of form, or the order of parts in a piece. For example, you\u2019re not really going to see any jazz written in sonataform, or a classical\u2014or even classical-contemporary\u2014piece written in AABA. These are differences that aren\u2019t immediately observable. ",
