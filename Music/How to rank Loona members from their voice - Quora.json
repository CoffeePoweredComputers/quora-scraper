            "answer_text": "I love all of them equally ugh, but here we go again. This is not by vocal ability but just my preference of each voice. I love all members and I think they\u2019re equally talented. Heejin - her voice is so pretty, soothing and versatile. I\u2019m a sucker for Heejins voice.Chuu - shes pretty main vocal material, her voice is so sweet and pretty. Pretty sure everyone loves Chuu\u2019s voice.Olivia Hye - her voice is so smooth and silky and unique. I love it a lot.Hyunjin - not typical but I LOVE soft voices! Hyunjin\u2019s is so pretty and airy.Haseul - sorry Haseul fans, I love our leader as much as anyone but I\u2019m not that big of a fan of her voice. She is an amazing singer but I\u2019m just not that into her nasally, opera voice.Choerry - Choerry\u2019s voice is so cute, energetic and versatile as well.Kim Lip - very vocal capable but I\u2019m not too big of a fan. She\u2019s a good singer but her voice isn\u2019t that special.Go Won - not something you\u2019d typical listen to, but I LOVE Go Won\u2019s crunchy vocals! They're so cute and pure!Yves - again very vocal capable her voice just isn\u2019t that unique. If this was dance though\u2026Jinsoul - Jinsoul has strong vocals and a unique voice but I don\u2019t dig them too much.Yeojin - Ugh sorry I couldn\u2019t put our lentil bean higher, I LOVE your voice as much as the rest of the girls, but BBC won\u2019t let us hear too much vocals from you right!! and the vocals from My Melody and Kiss Later weren\u2019t my favorite. Can\u2019t wait to hear how it sounds now.Vivi - I love Vivi! But compared to the rest of the girls I have to put her last :( I love everyone\u2019s voice, but Vivi\u2019s is pretty weak compared to the rest, she\u2019s improving so much though! I love her and can\u2019t wait to hear from her!",
