            "answer_text": "A2A: For me, there are two main reasons. Quality of music: The German entries from about 2004 (when I started watching) until the present haven\u2019t exactly been great. There have been some distinct standouts - I was partial to Texas Lightning\u2019s \u201cNo No Never\u201d, loved Roger Cicero\u2019s \u201cFrauen regier\u2019n die Welt\u201d and was fond of Roman Lob\u2019s \u201cStanding Still\u201d - and one incredibly impressive winner in Lena\u2019s \u201cSatellite\u201d. In general terms, though, Germany\u2019s not really entered something with the \u201coomph\u201d to win, certainly when you compare the German entry in a given year with the winner in the same year. This isn\u2019t just a German problem, I should point out. The \u201cBig Four\u201d (or by now \u201cBig Five\u201d) who are pre-qualified for the final have all been accused of phoning their entries in pretty often. Italy, since their return, have entered at least three legitimate contenders (\u201cFolia d\u2019amore\u201d, \u201cGrande amore\u201d and 2017\u2019s exercise in wit and silliness \u201cOccidentali\u2019s Karma\u201d), Spain appears to at least be trying at the moment, and France has shown some evidence of interest (\u201cJe cherche\u201d in particular) but also enters rubbish like \u201cMoustache\u201d. And of course there\u2019s the UK, the less of which we speak the better. Exactly why this is, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve read a lot of suggestions that because those five countries don\u2019t have to fight through a qualification process (and, with the exception of Italy, don\u2019t always have a highly competitive national final), it might have bred a level of complacency. Compare them to Sweden, for example, which puts every potential entrant through the wringer of Melodifestivalen (in some years, I\u2019d argue that the top 4\u20135 Melodifestivalen entries could win the Eurovision of that year), only to then have to go through a semi-final every year for the chance to turn up at the final. No wonder someone like Sanna Nielsen or M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w - both serial Melodifestivalen entrants - brought their A-game to Eurovision. Voting Patterns: This isn\u2019t one of those \u201ceveryone votes for their neighbours, so Eurovision\u2019s rigged\u201d things. The take-home message of my first point is that if you have a good song, Europe votes for you in big numbers. The issue, is, though, that in a year where you have a so-so song, or there\u2019s no true standout, Germany doesn\u2019t have \u201cbuddies\u201d in the way that some of the rest of the continent does. Take the D\u00fcsseldorf contest (2011) as an example. Now, I\u2019m not going to say \u201cTaken By A Stranger\u201d should have won, but \u201cRunning Scared\u201d (which did) didn\u2019t win by all that much. Realistically, there were a fair few songs which could have/should have won that year. What mattered was the ability to sway a handful of votes to go to Azerbaijan, rather than anyone else. Why so? Azerbaijan was already attracting a decent number of votes from the former Soviet states and Turkey, so it had a \u201cbase\u201d ready to roll. The same would apply in terms of a Scandinavian or Balkan entry - there\u2019s a reason at least one Scandinavian entry is in the higher reaches of the scoreboard, and why one Balkan entry tends to be as well. While there are Germans living and working all over Europe, though, they don\u2019t equate to the \u201cdiaspora\u201d that some other countries enjoy. Germany customarily voted in droves for the Turkish entry when the Turks were entering, because of the size of that diaspora, for example. Germany (and the other Big Five, to be frank) don\u2019t have that going for them. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that\u2019s simply because the rest of the EBU countries simply hasn\u2019t liked their music lately. Most people seem to have forgotten Roman Lob and him ending up in 8th place in 2012 (personally I thought that deserved top 3 - love that song), and they ended up winning in 2010 (that song I wasn\u2019t very fond of though). Also, when Ann Sophie ended up in last place, the voting rules were different. If it had been now, she would, at least, not end up with no points at all. I honestly kind of liked that song - I loved her voice, at least. The last few years just hasn\u2019t gone that well for them. For some reason, the voters just haven\u2019t been that fond of their songs. Sad but true. Why the juries haven\u2019t been that kind either, I can\u2019t say. ",
