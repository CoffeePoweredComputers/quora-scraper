            "answer_text": "Spotify did not explicitly say no. However, you won\u2019t earn exactly what you\u2019d expect. The thing is that Spotify is pretty good at detecting fraudulent streaming scenarios, and if you stream your songs on repeat for a month or even longer, you\u2019d get noticed. If it looked like you were just trying to cheat the system, you might get your account banned or song removed. This is not worth the gain. Why not choose a music stream tool to generate real stream for your song? AIOSTREAM is a music stream tool developed by WHB. It has been confirmed by many customers that it can generate real streams, and you will get paid. You can manage multiple accounts, and these accounts can be bound to proxy, so that when the accounts are running, they will come from different devices and countries, and Spotify will not able to detect them. Besides, you can customize your playback task. You can set it to run in different periods, or like and save the song while running. This way the operation looks more real. The new developed Anti-Fingerprint Technology can help you easily bypass the detection of Spotify. So you have no worry about the account being blocked, and the streams is real, you just need to sit and count the money. How happy, isn\u2019t it? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it is legal to play your song on Spotify. If you are planning to get streams by playing a song repeatedly with the same account, then I do not recommend it. One reason is that your account may be detected by Spotify, so your account is in danger of being blocked or your song is flagged and deleted. Another reason is the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use and section 9 point 8 states that it is not permitted to artificially increase play counts. To get legal streams for your track, you may consider using the aiostream software, it is an app for Spotify web player. With it, you can manage multiple Spotify free or paid accounts with different IPS, and use these accounts to play your songs, to obtain effective and natural traffic and listeners. When setting the playback task, you can set the duration of each song, the number of accounts used, and the number of times each account is used to play the song. In 2014, Spotify included the playback volume based on the playing time of each song, which is it will count as a play as long as 30 seconds are listened to. But to be on the safe side, I recommend that you set the duration of the song to be larger (120-240s). Because when a person listens to a song, it\u2019s impossible to listen for only 30 seconds. good luck! ",
