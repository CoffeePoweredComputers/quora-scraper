            "answer_text": "Spotify pays $.0037 for ad-supported streams and $.006 for \u201cpaid\u201d subscription streams (premium streams) but that\u2019s not just for the artist - that is for record labels that will distribute to artists, music writers, record producers and their own cut as investors on publishing the music and marketing costs. Usually the artist only gets something after all costs are paid. On average only 5% to 10% of that value goes directly to Artists after initial recording and marketing costs are paid (more if the artist is also the songwriter). Over 80% of Spotify streams are ad-supported. On average 50 million yearly stream plays are divided in 40 million at $.0037 and 10 million at $0.006. That\u2019s an estimated total of $208 000 ($148 000 from ad supported streams plus $60 000 from paid streams). If that\u2019s an older song and initial recording and marketing costs were already paid (those values change artist to artist) then the artist will get around $10 000 to $20 000 from those 50 million streams. Some major acts may get a 12% to 15% - or even 20% but that would probably be public and it\u2019s not so not sure if anyone have a contract that gives them so much (in the past on record sales only Madonna and Michael Jackson managed to get as high as 20% or 25% from CD sales when most major acts would get just 8% to 15% - Madonna current Live Nation contracts gives her 25% of pure sales). Streams count much more for charts than for Artist pockets. 50 million streams are equivalent to over 33.333 album sold for charts and certifications and added over 333.333 tracks sold but only gives the artist $10 400 to $20 800 on best scenario. Those 50 million streams equivalents in Pure Sales give much more to artists. 33.333 album pure sales and 333.333 tracks pure sales - count same for charts and certifications as those 50 million streams - give an artist from $60.000 to $112.000 (or even over $180.000 if the artist is Madonna). This numbers were calculated with the average of $12 per album sale (most new albums have more expensive deluxe editions, special editions and expensive double vinyl versions that would increase the average earnings - these pure sales earning numbers are all pretty conservative). Also if the artist wrote the songs will get the respective copyright value. (just like happens with streams). So the artist will get at least 6 times to 10 times more from pure sales - sometimes even more when considered the equivalent streaming from charts. Some major stars are artists, writers and producers so they get bigger cuts for all their roles on the album/song (from both streaming and pure sales). ",

            "answer_text": "According to my understanding of Spotify\u2019s payout rates, 1 stream=$0.00397, then 50 million streams=$0.00397x 50,000,000=$198,500. So artists make $198,500 for 50 million streams.  In fact, 50 million streams yearly is a better situation, and many people cannot reach this level. Have you ever wondered how others achieve it? First of all, I know that many music artists will choose automation to help them save time, because they will spend the time saved on more important things-creating quality songs and making attactive playlists. AIOStream is an amazing music marketing software. It has been proven to effectively increase your song likes, views, and follows within a very short time. It was created by the WhiteHatBox team for music in the US and has grown in leaps and bounds to have over 100 million users today.  AIOStream can also play, follow, and like a batch of songs, lists, and users on Spotify. The team behind this product always keep improving and updating it every day with the aim of making it the best music marketing platform on the planet. It works with Spotify, SoundCloud, Deezer, Napster, and iHeartRadio, and will soon be adding Google Music, Apple Music, and Tidal to that list. You can run multiple tasks on it at the same time, and it is possible to create a single task that is a mix of different sites\u2019 functionalities to come up with one complex task. With this automation,, 50 million streams yearly will not be your dream but come true. ",
