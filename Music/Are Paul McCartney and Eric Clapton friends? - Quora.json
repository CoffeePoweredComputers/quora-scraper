            "answer_text": "In the 60s, I\u2019ve read they were at the same club watching Hendrix perform live .. and think all of them probably were at the same places when young in the 60s, \u2026 perhaps later. In recent years they\u2019ve performed together (see below) but coming out of the 1960s, their music was definitely different. Clapton, like the Beatles\u2019 Harrison, loved what the Band were doing in upper state New York, and it really changed his music style in the 70s. McCartney, on the other hand, established himself as a solo artist pretty much evolving and adapting his Beatles-type sound. Still they\u2019ve shared the stage sporadically through the decades, and don\u2019t think they\u2019d do that if they weren\u2019t friendly. Here are some recent performances While My Guitar Gently Weeps by Harrison for the White Album, on which Clapton originally was a guest guitarist for the track.  The Beatles \u201cAbbey Road\u201d Medley (Lennon and McCartney) for a 1997 benefit. Gotta wait until the end with for 3-guitar interplay with Clapton, McCartney, and Knofler (like the original interplay with Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison)  Well not really \u201cthe End\u201d .. close to the end.
