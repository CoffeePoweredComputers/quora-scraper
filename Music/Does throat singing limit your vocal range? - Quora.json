            "answer_text": "What do you *mean by \u201cthroat singing?\u201d Here\u2019s a little info: In International Italianate terms (in English here), we refer to \u201cchest voice,\u201d because sensations felt in the chest on lower notes and in the speaking voice (I think this is what you mean by throat singing?). \u201cHead voice\u201d is used on mid/high notes, and sensations are felt more in the head. IF you carry the pure chest voice up too high (using the heavy speaking voice muscles and adjustment), then YES, your range will be very limited; also you can damage the voice and you will likely make a sound that\u2019s not desireable. To improve and explore this further, study singing with an experienced teacher who has academic credentials. *NOTE: \u201cThroat singing\u201d refers to a special technique practiced by the Tuvan people of Mongolia :) Tuvan throat singing - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "Yes it does. Quite severely in fact. Throat singing can be very damaging and put enormous strain on your vocal cords when you sing resulting in vocal nodes, and overblown vocal folds. Short answer is I wouldn\u2019t recommend it at all. Learn open throat singing instead. ",
