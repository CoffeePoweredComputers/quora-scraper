            "answer_text": "Sometimes, even if you\u2019re not trying, it seems that your mind wanders to a song by default. When the lyrics and tune of a song get stuck on repeat in your head, this music often provides an escape for your wandering mind. Moreover, it gives us a hook to hang the words on. We know that if the words don\u2019t match with that temporal structure they can't be the right words. So, it kind of narrows down the problem space, narrows down the search space. Lyrics to a piece of music is probably even more so because there's not only the rhythmic structure, but there's also melodic structure \u2013 the tune, the ups and downs, and the pitch that the words accompany. Put all these together, and that gives you a very powerful set of cues that help you remember, much more perfectly than just remembering random phrases or sentences. ",
