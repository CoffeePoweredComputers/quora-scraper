            "answer_text": "The song is considered racist because of the imagery it invokes and time period it gained popularity, exactly when the Southern states seceded.  \"Dixie\" was written in New York, by a native of Ohio, Daniel Decatur Emmett, as a minstrel song, which were primarily written to be performed by white actors in blackface. In fact, at the time he wrote \"Dixie,\" Emmett was working for an all-white performance company which almost exclusively performed in blackface. Most of us think of \"Dixie\"as the anthem of the Confederacy. Actually, at first, it was very popular in the North. Minstrel-style songs just weren't as popular in the South. When South Carolina became the first Southern state to secede in 1860, the song was just starting to reach the South. The newly formed Confederates rejected their old nation's anthems, like \"Yankee Doodle Dandy,\" and were looking for replacements. When it was played at Confederate President Jefferson Davis\u2019 inauguration in February 1861, \"Dixie\" was unofficially endorsed as the Confederate anthem. Repeated performances of \u201cDixie\u201d by Confederates confirmed its new status.  Even before Virginia seceded, the Richmond Dispatch labeled \u201cDixie\u201d the \u201cNational Anthem of Secession,\u201d and the New York Times concurred a few months later, observing that the tune \u201chas been the inspiring melody which the Southern people, by general consent, have adopted as their \u2018national air.'\u201d Publishers recorded that sales were \u201caltogether unprecedented\u201d and, when Robert E. Lee sought a copy for his wife in the summer of 1861, he found none were left in all of Virginia. - New York Times  David M. Rubenstein Rare Book & Manuscript Library, Duke University Original sheet music for \u201cDixie\u201d \u201cDixie\u201d became so connected so quickly with the South that many Americans attributed its very name to the region. In fact, the precise origin of the word \u201cDixie\u201d remains unknown, though three competing theories persist. It either references a benevolent slaveholder named Dix (thus slaves wanting to return to \u201cDix\u2019s Land\u201d), Louisiana (where $10 notes were sometimes called Dix notes), or \u2014 and most likely \u2014 the land below the Mason and Dixon\u2019s line (the slaveholding South). Regardless, Emmett\u2019s tune made it part of the national vocabulary. During the Civil War, soldiers, civilians and slaves frequently referred to the South as Dixie and considered Emmett\u2019s ditty the region\u2019s anthem. I Wish I was in de land ob cotton, Old times dar am not forgotten Look away! look away! look away! Dixie Land. In Dixie Land whar I was born in, Early on one frosty mornin\u2019, Look away! look away! look away! Dixie Land. Den I wish I was in Dixie, Hooray! hooray! In Dixie Land I\u2019ll take my stand, To lib and die in Dixie, Away, away, away down south in Dixie, Away, away, away down south in Dixie. The more Americans on both sides believed that \u201cDixie\u201d was the Confederate anthem, the more it became true. Soldiers were some of the first to embrace \u201cDixie\u201d and increasingly associated it with sacrifices made for the war.  Abraham Lincoln recognized the song\u2019s power and, at the end of the Civil War, tried to reinvent \u201cDixie\u201d as an American, rather than Confederate, song.  When a band serenaded him in the White House at the end of the Civil War, he asked the musicians to play \"Dixie\" saying, \"I have always thought 'Dixie' one of the best tunes I have ever heard. Our adversaries over the way attempted to appropriate it, but I insisted yesterday that we fairly captured it . . . I now request the band to favor me with its performance.\" (April 10, 1865) - Lincoln Financial Foundation Collection The reason it's considered offensive and racist is because it has always been associated with the Confederacy and what the Confederacy stood for, the reason most Southern states seceded, slavery.  The Reasons for Secession  \u201cDixie\u201d is still associated with its Confederate identity. Although just a simple minstrel song, almost 200 years of history have loaded the song with permanent political, racial, military and social connotations. \u201cDixie\u201d is still the South\u2019s anthem, and will probably continue to be for many years.

            "answer_text": "I think there\u2019s another question that needs to be asked: who considers Dixie racist? To determine the meaning of any sort of message or communication, you need to look at two things: the way that people who send the message perceive it, and the way that people who receive the message perceive it. This helps clear up a lot of questions about symbols pertaining to the South, including this one. As for people who send the message, it\u2019s a mixed bag. The writers of the song didn\u2019t include any explicitly racial content, and the lyrical themes of nostalgia for the Southland have resonated with many over time. However, it was also part of the blackface minstrel tradition, which was a racially problematic context. The Confederacy adopted it as an unofficial anthem, and various white supremacist groups have utilized it since the Civil War. Though the song\u2019s lyrics don\u2019t necessarily support white supremacy, there\u2019s a long history of people using the song in support of a South defined by white supremacy. However, Abraham Lincoln also used the song at his election rallies and upon Lee\u2019s surrender. Dating back to the Civil War itself, there\u2019s been a tradition of people using the song to express affection for the South while repudiating the white supremacist vision of Dixie, and many people who reference the song today (or other Confederate symbols, like the Confederate flag) do so in this vein. Many people on the receiving end of the message perceive the song to be racist. Given the song\u2019s history, this is entirely defensible. For those who have suffered due to white supremacy, this is even more understandable. That said, discourse about Southern symbols like \u201cDixie\u201d would be well-served by understanding this distinction between sending and receiving messages. Often, people who receive messages like \u201cDixie\u201d as racist assume that since they perceive the message to be racist, those who send the messages must be doing so with racist intent. Because these symbols have various, multifaceted meanings, that\u2019s not necessarily true, and it shuts down dialogue. A better way is to explain why you received the message as racist and the historical context of using it for racist ends. And if you receive the Southern symbols like this song as irredeemably racist, it\u2019s also worth examining why. Moonlight-and-magnolias Old South romanticism is treacherously na\u00efve, but it\u2019s also dangerously simple to discredit all Southern nostalgia as a form of cloaked racism. Doing so ignores Northern complicity in white supremacy (\u201cDixie\u201d itself was written for minstrel shows in the North, after all) and ignores the long tradition of valuing the South while opposing how it was twisted in support of slavery and segregation.
