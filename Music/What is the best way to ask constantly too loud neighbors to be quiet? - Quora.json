One to one personal interactions are always the most effective way to get your point across. Building a relationship with your neighbours is really important when you live in close quarters. Being open and respectful goes a long way. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Have a polite conversation with each and let them know the noise (try to define what, where, and when) is disturbing you and ask if there is a way for them to reduce or eliminate it. At the same time, ask if there is anything you can do or not do to be a better neighbor to them. As it turns out, my wife and I own a 2-family 1908 house (upper and lower level apartment) that we rent. I know noise transmission between floors is the most common complaint of renters in this situation. The issue is the house construction more than unreasonably loud noise. I am just finishing a full renovation of the 1st floor and put substantial time and effort into reducing noise transmission between apartments. It will never meet current code for new multi-family construction, but testing indicates a huge improvement. I mention this because you may be dealing with those same inherent shortfalls and if that is the case, it may change your perspective on your neighbor\u2019s noise. ",
