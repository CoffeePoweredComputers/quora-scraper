            "answer_text": "For me it somewhat depends on context. If I am sitting in my car at a stoplight, with the windows rolled down and happen to hear someone in another car singing badly, I tend to smile. I appreciate their passion and joy. I acknowledge that I sing in the car too sometimes, and it\u2019s probably not good. What I really, really dislike is when people sing in a public, shared space that you can\u2019t avoid or escape\u2026 like on a train, or a bus. Even if it is moderately good singing, sometimes its just weird and awkward and annoying. I have several co-workers who occasionally break out in song at work. Two of them sing pretty well, and I will go along with it unless the singing is really disrupting my work or focus, in which case I ask them to stop singing until I leave the area. BUT, there is another co-worker who doesn\u2019t *sing* so much as just chant or shout out two random lines of a rap song over and over intermittently throughout the day. It is completely, utterly obnoxious. He has no tone variations. No flow. I imagine it is a bit like working with someone who has Tourette\u2019s, but in this case he is intentionally being loud and sometimes using inappropriate language just to annoy other people. People with a disability cannot help it. This guy is really just completely inconsiderate. He knows it annoys other people, and continues to do it gleefully. ",

If they\u2019re singing a Justin Bieber song, it\u2019s bad by default (sorry Bieber fans no personal offense intended :P) and I try to avoid it as much as possible. No high-quality voice can save that\u2026 :P On the other hand, if they\u2019re just flat/sharp, I usually try to avoid cringing (I am apparently very sensitive to pitch, maybe from having studied music from very early on) and if it\u2019s my brother, I just tell him he was off and then ignore it; otherwise, I just ignore it. I can blot out sounds somewhat when I\u2019m focused on something, as indicated by when my parents get irritated that somehow I didn\u2019t hear (not didn\u2019t hear clearly; just completely didn\u2019t hear) a complete sentence directed to me :P If it\u2019s truly horrible and I can avoid it, I usually leave, listen to other music over theirs, or just deal with it if it\u2019s not going to be for too long. If they\u2019re singing really obnoxiously in a place I can\u2019t avoid, I won\u2019t confront them because I try to not make enemies with anyone, so I just deal with it and try to handle the irreversible damage to my already low sanity :P ",

I heard a really bad youth choir sing SILENT NIGHT and it brought tears to my eyes. Mostly I analyze why they are bad and make note of it so I can learn and be a better director. The worst singers are the best teachers - they teach you what not to do. It is fun to analyze their flaws. I don\u2019t know, if a child gifted you a picture they drew and it was awful, wouldn\u2019t it touch your heart and you would appreciate the gift that it is and the effort that went into its creation? I kind of see bad singing like that. I am also gifted with a very low attention span. For instance, when I was nine I ",
