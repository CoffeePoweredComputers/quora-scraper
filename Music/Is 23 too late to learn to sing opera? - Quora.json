            "answer_text": "No, not if you already know how to sing. Light, lyric voices will have trouble starting this late, but bigger and lower voices (contraltos and basses, plus the late blooming dramatic sopranos and tenors) will not even have matured physically enough to do the work they will be able to do after forty. Try to enhance the skill first, practice daily and be consistent. Develop the skills and they require practice, then start with few songs, so that training doesn't appear to be a mundane task, because if you are not enjoying it, you are not necessarily learning it. Go to my Profile and you can find all about Learn To Sing material there... ",

            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t know much about that kind of training, but I do know it would be too late to train for ballet - except maybe for character roles. Does Opera training evolve a restructuring of some anatomical part - as ballet does? Does it re-structure the throat, the diaphragm, the vocal chords? My sense is that it does not restructure so much as strengthen those parts, so it might just be possible to begin the training for that art even as late as 23. Maybe even later - ya never know! ",
