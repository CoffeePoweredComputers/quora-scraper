            "answer_text": "Yes, we need a philosophy of music education. Here\u2019s mine. I believe that music should be an indispensable facet in every level of education, public or private. I believe that music education has a positive effect on every student. I think that any philosophy of music education should start by answering a series of questions: 1. What is music? 2. What are basic acoustics and how do we hear? 3. What is a melody and how does a melody work? 4. What is harmony and how does harmony work? 5. What are aspects of rhythm\u2014beat/pulse, meter/measure, tempo/pace, swing/lilt, accent, etc. 6. How does a composer create music and how does a performer perform music? 7. What are typical musical structures? 8. What is musical color? i.e. the sound of different instruments, dynamics, articulation, attack, sustain, ornamentation, etc. 9. How does music create emotions? 10. What does the history of musical styles include? ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a coincidence that I was discussing this very topic with a group of students this morning. A Philosophy of Music Education is VERY IMPORTANT because it will define why you are becoming/became a music teacher. It should be your mantra. It\u2019s important because there will be very dark days ahead when you\u2019re going to need to remind yourself why you\u2019re doing this. Days when you\u2019ve got a concert looming and the kids are being monsters and the administration is crawling up your ass about programming \u201creligious music\u201d (The Messiah) and there\u2019s a parent on Line 4 who thinks that you\u2019re \u2018out to get\u2019 her little shmumpkin. Days when you desperately need to grade papers but someone decided that you and your Master\u2019s Degree are urgently needed on Bus Duty, Lunch Duty, or any of a thousand other duties. But it ain\u2019t all bad. The reward is great. My Philosophy of Music Education (with some help from Bennett Reimer): \u201cI believe that Music is basic, unique, and necessary to the Public School Curriculum. I believe that I was born with a gift of Music and it is my mission to share that gift with young people.\u201d There\u2019s more to it than that, but that\u2019s it in a nutshell. Best of luck! ",
