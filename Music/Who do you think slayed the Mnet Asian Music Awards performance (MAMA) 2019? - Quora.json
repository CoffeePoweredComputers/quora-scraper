            "answer_text": "ONEUS They are so underrated, but atleast now more people saw how talented they are, plus how they have such a versatile and great rapline.  ATEEZ This also slapped. // Also I get such early years Monsta X vibes from ATEEZ (I\u2019m not saying they are copying them, don\u2019t attack me), they have somewhat the same energy, and it\u2019s cute how excited they were when they got to seat next to MX.  WayV Also WayV being talented aggressively.  ",

            "answer_text": "For me, it was Monsta X, Oneus x Ateez (that was amazing), WayV, Got7 (my ult group), Chungha, Seventeen, Mamamoo and Twice. I missed the earlier performances before Chungha so I can\u2019t speak about those. But I thought the groups mentioned above were the best. I was bopping around in my chair while listening to their performances while I was typing up a paper. I really liked the N.O. and Dionysus bits from BTS but the other parts didn\u2019t really catch my attention. I did however notice that once again Jimin killed it with his flips. Boy has some serious spring in his dancing. As for J.Y.Park. Haha that man. But honestly? The first part with Mamamoo\u2026little creepy. But the rest of his stuff wasn\u2019t that bad. I was surprised. ",
