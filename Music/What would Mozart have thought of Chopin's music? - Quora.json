            "answer_text": "I'd like to think that Mozart would have enjoyed Chopin's music; after all, it's no secret that the latter held the former in the highest esteem, and Chopin was not in the habit of issuing compliments to others (and if he did, only grudgingly). However, he did genuinely enjoy Mozart and Bach, even playing their music. Unfortunately, I'm afraid that the overwhelming evidence is decidedly the opposite. The best proof we have is the fact that there was a piano competition between Mozart and a guy named Muzio Clementi; the duel was arranged by Emperor Joseph II, who wanted to put the greatest pianist in Austria against the greatest pianist outside. Mozart, a notoriously arrogant musician, had always written to family and friends of how other pianists had caused him to \"almost laugh to death\" after hearing them. Clementi, however, was not the average pianist, and Mozart being confined to Austria, could not have known about him. Mozart did not die laughing after this legendary contest. Clementi was a pianist far ahead of his time; his technical effects, especially in creating a dazzling passages, was an unknown ability for Mozart, who prided himself with his own clean and unaffected playing. Maynard Solomon's biography of Beethoven quotes him as saying that \"Mozart's playing was neat and clean, but rather antiquated.\" In other words, Mozart represented the past. Which is not to suggest that Mozart was ineffective. Indeed, most of his peers attest to his unsurpassed legato (Mozart refers this as being able to \"flow like oil.\"). The authors Marcia Davenport and Harold Schonberg wrote that Mozart was very disturbed after his encounter with the great Italian, and that he was so shaken up by his rival's superior technique that he resorted to writing vitriolic letters about him. Mozart even called Clementi \"a charlatan, like all the Italian,\" What would he say, then, about Chopin? Superior as Mozart's music is to Clementi's, he just was not in the same league as a pianist. It would be Clementi's virtuosity that inspired Beethoven, John Field and the other early Romantics. The pianist/author David Dubal calls Mozart \"the supreme classicist\", and all the musicians of Mozart's day support this. Though Chopin loved Mozart, the converse would not be true, for Chopin represented everything that he detested in Clementi. ",

            "answer_text": "If Mozart had somehow been cryogenically frozen in 1791 and woken up right before Chopin's death in 1849 to pass judgement, it's likely Mozart would have thought Chopin was more than a little vulgar. A pretty huge amount changed in that half-century, and Mozart would probably have been disoriented by the changes in the whole of the musical landscape to the extent that he'd be unable to really judge Chopin's place in it. But let's consider the other possibility: what if Mozart had lived into his 90s and heard all of the changes of the time, adapting his own compositional style with them? What would he have thought of Chopin then? Let's look for clues first in the composers Mozart admired. The first name that comes to mind is Haydn, of course, who taught Mozart, and had a huge influence on him as a person and a musician. Once, famously, Mozart overheard another composer criticizing Haydn, saying \"I would not have [developed that theme that way].\" Mozart, furious, replied \"Neither would I. Do you know why? Because neither of us would have thought of it.\" So Haydn makes the list for sure. Mozart also admired Handel's work, particularly later in his life. He respectfully studied J.S. Bach, but preferred his more adventurous son, C.P.E Bach. He wrote variations on themes by many composers, most of whom are likely not to arouse much attention nowadays, with a pair of exceptions: Gluck and Paisiello. Unfortunately, that list of composers alone does us relatively little good without context for why Mozart might have liked them. In order to understand and contextualize this list of composers into something a bit more instructive, let's try to evaluate these composers on the basis of the three traits that Mozart most frequently cited in his letters as important in composers:a: Importance/skill of melodic writingb: Affective chromaticismc: Importance of affect/mood to composition Unsurprisingly, all six of the composers mentioned above are strong in these areas. The only outliers come in the area of \"extent of chromaticism\", Paisiello and Gluck, whom Mozart used only as variation subjects, and thus their chromaticism wasn't a factor. So how would Chopin have stacked up according to these standards? Probably quite well. Certainly better than Beethoven would have. Chopin's competition in his own time might have come from Schumann and Schubert. It's hard not to be curious how Mozart would have felt about Rossini, who idolized Mozart, and whose style can clearly be heard to come out of Mozart's aesthetic, but who fails spectacularly on trait b (chromaticism). This matter of \"idolization\" is the final element that I think should be discussed. Listen to this recording of Chopin's variations on Mozart's \"L\u00e0 ci darem la mano\" (from Mozart's Don Giovanni).   Chopin had an enormous respect for Mozart, and when I listen to this recording, I can't help but imagine this tune running through Chopin's mind over and over again, obsessing him, with Chopin varying it continually and digging into the music until it became his own. Listen to the fifth variation (11:24 into this recording), when Chopin transplants the theme to his native Poland. There's such a reverence in Chopin's treatment of this music, almost a sadness, longing to touch this incredibly rich compositional entity. If Mozart had lived to be worshipped as he would have been by Chopin and his contemporaries, it's very difficult to know exactly how that would have altered his taste. All we know is that, in that case, it seems very likely that Mozart would have relished the praise and attention, and come to explore Chopin just as thoroughly in return. It reminds me of the comment that Mozart made to the rehearsal conductor of Don Giovanni, ostensibly while rehearsing the very same \"L\u00e0 ci darem la mano\": It is a mistake to think that the practice of my art has become easy to me. I assure you, dear friend, no one has given so much care to the study of composition as I. There is scarcely a famous master in music whose works I have not frequently and diligently studied. ",
