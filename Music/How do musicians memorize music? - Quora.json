            "answer_text": "You mean memorize a song? Band practise. Never ending band practise and for a drummer it can be a little boring at times. The guitars and keyboards have to get the chords down, so you wait. Then the harmonies had to be worked out. I sang backup and also some lead songs so that was okay. But if you, as a drummer didn\u2019t sing, more boring time. Play some games in your cell phone. Then, the band plays the song over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over until it\u2019s good and tight. By then, you know it pretty good. I was a fill in drummer before becoming a touring drummer for big named recording bands. For both of these, I would be sent tapes with the bands songs on them that they did. Sometimes I\u2019d have a couple of weeks to learn them sometimes one day. I\u2019d tell my wife, gotta go to work hon, then I\u2019d go downstairs to the drums, slap on the tapes and again play them over and over and over and over ad unfinitum until I knew them. Sometimes I would have to learn back up vocal harmonies. A few times I had to go on stage at the last minute because the drummer was incapacitated and the band was going on in a few hours. So there I am in an arena before thousands of people with a song list with some of the songs I didn\u2019t know. So, I had to ad lib it. Scary? Yes! I remember one night I was bathing the boys. The agency calls, which was run by my own bands vocalist. \u201cCan you make it down to the concert hall, Alicia Bridge\u2019s drummer fell off the stage at sound check and broke his arm. ALICIA BRIDGES? I Like the Nightlife recording artist. So I call my wife to finish with the kids, zip down to the concert hall, meet a band I didn\u2019t know, have a quick practise and I\u2019m on stage in front if thousands of people. Stressful yes, but I loved it. Sometimes bands would have music sheets which helped. Sometimes it was a well known band and I knew most of the songs. I would constantly listen to the radio at home, in the car, everywhere I went getting songs into my brain. That was important. Listening to songs I liked and songs I hated. Filling in was damn good money. Afterwards, it led to being a touring drummer. It\u2019s repetition. That\u2019s it. Continuous repetition. That\u2019s how the music is memorized for vocals, guitars, drums, horns whatever. Even with music sheets. It\u2019s long hard work but it\u2019s what you do because it\u2019s your livelyhood and the better you are, the more gigs you get. You get known. ",

            "answer_text": "While I was a music major at Mansfield University, I developed, over time, a method that seemed to work for me to memorize music really well. However, just know that no matter what you do, it does require an immense amount of work, but if you enjoy playing your instrument(s) it becomes something that you love to do and something you get immense enjoyment out of. I had at times made major errors leading up to this whereby I would forget passages of my piece that I was performing because my practicing wasn\u2019t at the 150% level that it needed to be to truly memorize and therefore internalize my music. So by the time I got to my senior recital, I had decided how I would practice my pieces (I had to have an hour\u2019s worth of advanced classical guitar music memorized). I would practice my pieces everywhere and anywhere I could. I would find various places throughout the house that I was living in at the time and practice them from beginning to end. I would practice in my room (I rented a small one room apartment with a shared bathroom/ kitchen). I would practice on the front porch. In the stairwell, outside, in the bathroom, etc. While at Mansfield, on campus, I woud practice on stage in the auditorium (where I would be performing my recital), in the practice rooms, in different vacant classrooms. I would practice at the music store where I was teaching, often on the sales floor while customers were coming and going. Sidenote: My wife still to this day remembers being a younger version of herself and hearing me play at the music store while she visited, wondering who this guitar player was. Of course, we didn\u2019t know either other at the time, and later while we were dating, she later realized it was me she had heard, not realizing it at first. Try to find audiences of family members or trusted friends to play in front of. There is no better practice than this. You will find out real quick how well or not so well you know your music. Whatever you do, and however you do it, the number one rule is enjoy your practice and playing time. From this others will be attracted to what you are doing, and you will soon be very good at what you do! Blessings, Melving Williams ",
