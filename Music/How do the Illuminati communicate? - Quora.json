            "answer_text": "Why, whatsapp, of course ;) hehe. On the real\u2026 They probably communicate via email, telephone calls, instant messaging apps, etc, much like we do. They might have their own dedicated satellite's, applications, etc, which would enable a higher degree of privacy, but in terms of their manner of communication\u2026 I'm sure they communicate in the same way we do. Very important matters will likely be discussed in person. Using state of the art private jets, etc, they can actually travel to distant areas in no time at all. I remember Carl Cox once spinned his new year, midnight set, in three different countries, due to the time zones. With a fast enough jet, he was able to catch midnight in three countries on the same night. Pretty amazing huh. Not saying Carl Cox is part of the illuminati, but just saying, it's pretty amazing what people can accomplish. The illuminati also have these \u201cinside\u201d kinda jokes. They're obsessed with symbolism. Adverts, movies, logos, etc, are often riddled with symbolism which only illuminati insiders (or those in-the-know) will pick up on, so they communicate ideas in that way too, but that's more just to rub our noses in it, so to speak\u2026 It's a way of displaying their superiority over us. But as for communicating general messages to each other, they probably communicate just like we do, just that they probably use dedicated, private satellites, applications, etc. Then again, they own and control just about all the major technologies we use to communicate, anyway, so they might actually be using the same platforms we do. They control the technologies, and it's not like anyone can do anything to them anyway. Even if a hacker was to intercept one of their conversations, they probably couldn't really give a damn. You know, the whole \u201cworld is our oyster\u201d kinda mentality. Understand that the illuminati aren't just above the law. These guys are the law. They've got presidents, monarchs, heck, entire nations in their back pockets. They can pretty much communicate any way they want to. When you're the guys doing the monitoring, you don't have to worry about being monitored. They are \u201cbig brother,\u201d and while they undoubtedly have private, dedicated platforms for communication, I'm sure they mostly use the same technologies we do. It's all about convenience. When you're above the law, why inconvenience yourself by running through loops? Just do what you wanna do. You own the world. And if someone has a problem with it, just wipe them out, ruin their lives, whatever. It's all really simple for them. They honestly couldn't give a damn. None of us really matter. Also, since they're intimate with demons, those right at the top probably use these entities to send messages to each other. And of course, the illuminati are obsessed with magic, so it wouldn't surprise me if they communicated in more freaky ways on occasion. These guys have the ability to shift consciousness, so that's another means of communication at their disposal. Understand that we're talking about vehicles for demonic entities, and if you know anything about jinn and the nature of reality, you'll know that teleportation isn't out of the realm of possibility. And even of its not actual teleportation and just consciousness travelling at the speed of light, it's still damn fast. Although, I'm 80% sure that some jinn are capable of teleportation, in the true sense of the word. But for the most part\u2026 I'm sure they communicate in the same ways we do. It's just too convenient. I can't imagine them not using cellphones. It's their technology after all. They control it. And yes, there is a magical aspect to all this too. But if I really delve into this, you guys will really think I'm crazy, hehe. Taking magic out of the realm of the occult and labelling it as science\u2026 hehe. It's quite ingenious actually. If you showed someone 200 years ago a smart phone, how do you think they'd react? I'll tell you how\u2026 They'd call it magic. But\u2026 Who's to say it's not? There's a demonic aspect to all these technologies. What do you all know about quantum computing? D-wave? What's really going on at CERN? Do you know they admit to tapping into alternate dimensions? Do you know what these dimensions really are, and how it's affecting our reality? Understand this\u2026 We only know what they allow us to know. Technology has advanced way beyond what they would have us believe, and I'm telling you, there's a demonic component at the heart of it. Rituals\u2026 Blood sacrifices\u2026 And some things I shudder to mention. Sex, drugs and dragons\u2026 That's their religion. Magic is their life. It plays such an integral part in what's going on in the world, but we'll never realise. We're just too conditioned. Our minds enslaved. Our hearts sealed to illumination. Sorry, I know I drifted quite a bit, and I know I'm rambling, but you guys have no idea\u2026 There's just too much to say, and it's all so \u201cout there\u201d, I'm not even gonna go there. I'm sure I sound crazy enough already. But another time, perhaps. There are just too many pieces of the puzzle to fill in all at one go. Although, I've actually said quite a lot, if you analyse what I've said critically enough. In terms of the big picture, I've alluded to quite a bit, but as for how it all ties together\u2026 It's just too deep to get into. Without a thorough understanding of the nature of reality, magic, the satanic agenda, the antichrist, the way demons operate, etc, nothing I say will make much sense. When I say the cellphone you're holding is a magical component, it sounds crazy, right? Yeah, I know it does. But hey, that's the reality of it. Anyway, apologies for rambling. I don't expect you guys to believe everything, and I most certainly don't expect you to fully understand it, but for what it's worth, hope you can appreciate the perspective I've provided. ",
