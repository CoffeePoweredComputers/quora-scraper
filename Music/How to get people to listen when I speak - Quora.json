            "answer_text": "Say something worthy of being heard. I know a lot of people, teenagers especially, who feel like they are constantly being the Wallflowers of the social arena. Talking to people and being effective at communicating is exactly that\u2014an arena. As an introverted person and a former member of the shy club, I know the frustration of not being heard. People would talk over me or even talk like I wasn\u2019t there at all. Although it seems unfair and unjust, knowing the rules of communication are pertinent in a society of performers and expert players of the game we call life. That being said, you get heard by saying something worthy of being heard: Because of the content of the message.Because of the execution of the message.This past February I was mortified as I spent weeks preparing for an important chapel about achievement and success I had to give in front of my entire school. I practically had people rooting for my failure and expecting me to say something awkward or cringe worthy or a nice mixture of both. People expected me to fail. In an attempt to calm my nerves my best friend told me not to even care about what I would say due to the fact that mostly everyone fell asleep in chapel anyway. No way. Not anymore. Not to me! I completely threw away my plan and made a new one the night before. I typed everything out the next morning only mere hours before i stood in front of a crowd of 500 clueless teenagers and another 100 beaten down adults. The message started fairly slow with stories and bible verses that usually accommodated the average chapel, and right when I saw nearly all of the student body on the verge of a coma I said it, \u201cI\u2019m a SLUT for success\u201d The students went crazy. Half the teachers wanted me dead. The other half were secretly amused. The more conservative faculty was ready to crucify me. Everyone was listening. I was able to know my audience and execute a graphic plan that got the whole school to pay attention to what I had to say. For the next ten minutes I was able to preach about the failure to reach perfectionism, mental health issues, and a Christian solution to our obsession with success. I painted a picture for the audience that showed the dangers of self pride and thenhelped them through their own fears of facing it. Depsite the memes, jokes, and even t-shirts made about my statement, I was able to be heard among my peers and, something even more important, people remembered what I had to say. People started going to the guidance counselors more. People thanked me for introducing them to crisis text lines. If you want to be heard, say something worthy of being heard. You have to work on communication skills just like you would any other athletic or educational skill. You can always do better. Keep striving for greatness, just don\u2019t be a slut for success as you go on your way. TL; DR- say something worthy of being said by making your execution interesting so people can also pay atesnrjon to your interesting content. I shocked my Lutheran High School by making leud sexual metaphors during a chapel and everyone was all the better for it. ",

            "answer_text": "Um.. question - Why do you want to get people to listen to you ? - If it\u2019s all about being accepted by them, don\u2019t do it. It will not add any long term value to your life. If you are looking to grow as a people person(career(leadership)/interest) - you have to observer behavior of people and (hence) be in sync with them, Most people don\u2019t like content, however how it looks(don\u2019t believe me - why do girls/actress wear makeup ? :D) , you have to tolerate and take/accept a lot of things that you consider plain \u2018stupid\u2019 and at times act like one as well - This will take toll on you in case you are an introvert. Now that you have observed people\u2019s behavior - what offends them, present yourself in a fashion that they like/prefer. - They will initially start liking you. Later with interaction you can build rappo - and start expressing yourself. You can also exhibit and display a unique behavior however - they may or may not like it(every startup does not becomes apple :), although apple target is not the whole world however a small set of consumers who are ready to pay high for better quality(everyone in the world is not big fan of Quality in smart phones) ) After doing all that over a period of time - you will still find people who don\u2019t like/hear you. Hence - Do what you feel is \u2018right\u2019 not what people \u2018like\u2019. Identify and them focus on your goals and keep working on them instead of getting people to like you. When you present yourself - you attract people who like you for what you are - you don\u2019t have to fake anything with these people and these are the people who will hear you in all situations. If you present yourself as you are - you will attract \u2018permanent\u2019 people in your life who will stay with you in longer run - since you don\u2019t change - they don\u2019t leave you. If you are genuinely looking to change - display (fake it untill you make it) the changed behavior - You will attract like-minded people - their company will help you change. ( that\u2019s why you should only do this if you are looking to change) ",

            "answer_text": "Here are some suggestions of mine that how you should speak to the people that they will listen to you earnestly. GossipWe all like to gossip but do you know how much does it affect your character. If you do too much gossip about anyone , the people will not like you as people will portrays your character as weak . 2. Judging As we all knew that we like to judge people even things . Yeah it is not a bad thing but excess of anything can\u2019t be right . If we judge people too often and judge them by meeting them in a few moments it portrays a bad character of our in the society. First we should examine / observe the person carefully and then we should make our opinion about them and says our opinion in a calm voice like \u201c It is my opinion about you that you are like \u2026\u2026.. I didn\u2019t like this quality of your\u2019s \u2026\u2026\u2026 and at the end always tell him/her that I love this quality of yours\u2026\u2026.. because it is also very important that we should tell him/her about her/him good stuffs as it will lead a good impact on him/her and will not transmit too much negativity. 3. Negativity By just reading the heading you would have guessed what this point will be about. We should not be the person who just spreads negativity as people did not like that type of person who instead of motivating them just spreads negativity. 4. Complaining Don\u2019t complain too much like \u201c that I didn\u2019t have got this thing \u201d, \u201c I am the unluckiest person of the world \u201d and \u201cdestiny have not been fair with me \u201d these all sentences portrays a bad character of yours in front of the people. People will never consider you worthy of anything as they will always think that you just complains a lot instead of doing something. Always be optimistic and say that \u201c You can do this \u201d 5. Excuses Don\u2019t give too much excuses in life . Instead of giving excuses just give it a try at least. 6. Lying This point do not need much explanation as this point is self explanatory. We all knew the consequences of lying . I am not saying that in just one day you will completely lose this bad quality of yours but start today itself by not lying for unnecessary things at least. 7. Dogmatism Stating or thinking that your opinion is the best and not accepting or listening anybody else opinion. 8. We should always speak in a way that each and every word of yours can be listen by someone easily without much effort . For this we should not speak too slow or too loud we should just speak in a mid slow pace . 9. Bring some heaviness in your voice . 10. Be confident what you speak. 11. Use hand gestures as you are portraying a picture. I am not saying you that you should follow all these points which I have given because it is not possible to become too perfect in just a single day but at least out of nine of them you should try at least one and if you see the changes then try another one . If you like the points please comment and upvote the answer. ",

            "answer_text": "Very easy, seriously, very easy.. Are you talking to your colleagues at work? Workshop? Seminar? Or any public speaking event? You may see many articles on Google about \u2018 effective communication key\u2019 and all of them are very clear.  Figure: Illustration of communications (source from Google) But let me tell you what you can do to make people listen more, no matter you\u2019re at work, public events, sharing to friends, or confide in someone. Here are some of my tips. Make sure your opponent is not wearing headphone. It\u2019s useless if you try talking to them even they turning off what they just listening to. Come on, if they don\u2019t listen to you, you may get hurt, though the fact is you are the one that cannot see your environment. There are many reasons why people don\u2019t unwear headphone when you come. Maybe they just lazy to put it off or they really avoid you. But take it easy, just don\u2019t talk to them.See if people are busy or free. You cannot ask someone to stop their work just to focussing themselves on you. They may looking at you, nodding their head, hearing your voice, but you will easily notice that they are not listening to you. So better if you already know someone or people get busy, just let it go. See if people are prepared to listen, similar with point number 1.Make a good greeting and tell people what\u2019s your purpose. Ask how people are doing, like you usually do. If you see the point number 2 and you found that people are ready to focused on you, then go! Then, let them know what you gonna tell them to see are they interested in or not. You will notice people\u2019s gesture just in few seconds.If people interested to listen, then communicate with a clear plot, be systematically. As I always try, I never make a plot twisted, like go ahead then go back, no no no, that\u2019s really bad. People need to know whole story to keep the ideas on their mind. Like you construct a building, you have to do it systematically from bottom to the top, from the base one to the complex one. Oh yeah, i almost forgot, avoid the gap on your talking, like sounds \u201ceeemmm.. uuuhhh.. aaaaa..\u201d when you\u2019re thinking. People will get bored if you did it.Stay smooth and don\u2019t be emotional. You may get mad, happy, sad, or anything, but always try to be constant in everything. Stabilize you emotions, don\u2019t nervous, adjust your voice, make people relax. People will connected automatically to you if you bring the \u2018safe\u2019 image of you. Be calm and be nice..Attention to your body language. Similar with point number 5, you have to do it to your body too. Let your body language open and you can see how people are comfortable on facing you. Sit well or stand up well, don\u2019t be a robot, keep flexible.Be honest, don\u2019t manipulate. You tell what you are going to tell, not more. You may expected someone\u2019s reply, so you make a story complicated. It\u2019s not a good way because you will not get what people think and they will know you\u2019re lying or hiding something.Talk with heart and eyes. This is the core of the core, hahaha.. The key of communication is you send your message to people\u2019s heart and mind, not just to their ear. Look at them, be aware of your sight and keep your heart stays feel. It\u2019s different with being emotional, stays feel means your heart is deeply opening and you are ready to transfer it to your opponent. It\u2019s like you transfer an energy, sympathy, and empathy to someone. If you can feel, make your eyes warm, connected to your heart, because eyes are the windows.If you just do every point on number 1 to 8 and people still not listening to you, just go away and let it go. There are some people who never care about someone. Don\u2019t blame them, don\u2019t blame yourself. They are just not ready about the things you will tell, and you don\u2019t need the reason why.Nice to answer, hope this will help you.. ^_^ ",

            "answer_text": "The art of discourse.  The first rule of any communication is to deliver value for time donated to listening. A comedian will make us laugh, we know this and so we listen. There is a fit. we gain value in doing so. A lecturer in a university can spend hours talking on one subject and his students listen intently because for them there is value. They learn. There is a fit. So why do people invest their time to listen? The answer is trust. They already know what to expect from the speaker. They understand from experience that time invested here will yield reliable results. They trust they will gain value. The speakers have reputation. Reputation When we experience one another in the human tribe we become aware of patterns of behaviour. If we encounter an individual who brings us little value because they talk aimlessly on subjects we have no interest in then after once or twice of bumping into them, we learn to avoid them. The next time we see them we will employ whatever avoidance tactic we are comfortable with. We may state we are running late, we might abruptly give attention to someone or something else and move on impolitely, or we might simply go a different way on sight of them! We may adopt to miss their call. We do this because the person we are encountering has a low reputation with us. There is no value, in fact we gain nothing and we lose our time. We feel stress as we grow impatiently trapped in their grammar bubble! We tend to invest time and listen most to people we gain value from in one way or another. Value is the thing that makes a person acceptable to us. In moments of discourse value is created when the discourse delivered is appropriate, timed well and spoken considerately. Being appropriate In any given situation we can maximise the chance of becoming accepted and valued by making sure we are appropriate for that situation. This means checking three important things. Is our timing correct? If we attempt to speak at length to someone and misjudge that persons current priorities then we fail before we start.Is what we have to say going to bring immediate value? This could mean entertainment (humour, news, style of delivery), it might mean education (the delivery of instantly useful knowledge) It might mean emotional support (sympathy, understanding, encouragement)Do we have the qualification? Becoming too familiar with somebody we barely know before we are entitled is going to pressure the listener. For instance; if we begin to educate a person on a subject before they have accepted us as being qualified to do so. If we do not qualify for delivery we fail before we start. (There can be exceptions to this where perceptions of authority become involved)If we get number one wrong and misjudge timing, we become an inconvenience. If we get number two wrong and speak on a subject the person has no interest in, then; we become boring. If we get number three wrong and attempt a full on delivery of information without the person knowing us then; we become over familiar and unqualified. There are other mitigating factors that can further complicate an exchange but these three are without doubt very important basic factors. Reading a situation. All of the above amounts to reading the situation. If we respect the circumstances we find ourselves in with a person and respect our position in relation to that person then we can avoid falling on our face by communicating inappropriately. It is a wise approach to sit back, observe and calculate ones position before rushing in with a delivery. You cant talk about your new phone to a man putting the fire out in his house! Sharing the spotlight. Too often I come across people where conversation is all about them. This is a big mistake in any conversation! When we talk at length to someone all about our world, our thing or our situation, and we do not allow the other person to share their own situation, then the captive audience becomes an escapee very quickly. In order to develop a healthy conversation it is wise to be aware of how long we speak for. I try to keep my discourse down to a few sentences at most and then deliberately find a way to include my listener. I ask a question and invite them to participate. I am always interested in the other person. People like to share about themselves too! For this reason I try to share the spotlight! Know your strengths. Many people can optimise their reputation with others by understanding their own strengths. I often see insecure young people desperate to be accepted rush into a conversation with underdeveloped humour, loosely remembered non facts or inappropriate comments. Their insecurity gets mixed up with some fantasy image they have in their minds of the impressive person they wish they were. Often based on some role model that impressed them. In doing so they try to become a square peg in a round hole. Their personality doesn't fit, the way they look doesn't fit, their style of delivery is no where near developed enough and so they fall on their face and just come across as naive and rather silly. If they took time to understand their own true assets, that bring value to others, then they would be able to rely on a solid personality base that has a proven track record. If a person has had success making people laugh then humour is a strength. If a person has had a lot of success by delivering emotional support then this is a strength. If a person has people asking a lot of questions on one specific area of study then they are regarded as knowledgeable. This is a strength. When we operate to our known proven strengths and remain cool calm and collected the remainder of the time we are far more likely to develop a healthy reputation. People with a healthy reputation are more likely to be listened to and liked. Basil Simon Musical life coach Official web site ",

            "answer_text": "How do I get people to listen to me? I always have to listen to them; I feel unimportant. You have conjoined two issues in your question which I think should be viewed separately. The first is feeling unimportant; the second is getting people to listen to you. On feeling unimportant This could be the result of low self-confidence and/or low self-esteem. If you don\u2019t know and trust your own worth, why would others value you or pay attention to you? You resent feeling ignored so that tells me you do have some sense of your own value. Build on it. Healthy self-esteem is grounded in a factual appraisal of your strengths, skills and accomplishments as these reflect the values that are central to your identity. If you don\u2019t know what your values are, read this: What Are Your Values?: Deciding What's Most Important in Life Make a list of your good qualities, skills and accomplishments. If you\u2019re feeling down about yourself, ask a friend to help you. Make a second list of areas where you need to build strength. Give yourself credit for your strengths and think about how you could leverage them. Pick something about yourself that is a source of pride and think about how you could showcase it or build on it to take that confidence into another area of your life. Start a gratitude journal. Everyday, record something you are grateful for and identify something about yourself that you like or makes you feel proud. Let that feeling of justified pride feed your self-confidence. On getting others to listen I am a quiet, soft-spoken introvert but when I (eventually) choose to say something, people usually listen. Why? Because I\u2019m assertive about it and I get to the point. I expect them to listen and indicate that by making eye contact and continuing to speak in a determined fashion if others start talking over me. If they continue bulldozing me, I will say \u201cExcuse me, I haven\u2019t finished speaking.\u201d and then I continue. Does this approach work with obnoxious ignorant people? Not always. It\u2019s then I recall the advice to not throw your pearls before swine. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are some things to do when speaking to someone or an audience.  Be authoritative.  If you don't make it clear that you're the big dog at the moment, there will be an inclination to not pay respect and attention. When I was a senior in high school, I had these two teachers on the opposite ends of the spectrum. Dr. M was new, and a nice person, but he was too soft. Nobody took him seriously during class throughout the entire year. On the other hand, Mrs. B established a rigorous reputation there for years, and it became immediately clear to new students that she was the leader of the wolfpack, and that she wouldn't take any of their BS. You want Mrs. B's approach.  Ditch the monotone.  You can't captivate an audience if you speak like a robot. Vary the pitch of your voice. If you don't sound excited, how will your audience? Nobody likes monotone. Except maybe Siri.  Interesting stuff first, then the details.  It's basically the top-down approach to speaking, and our brains are more receptive to this. Plus, if you start with the application, then the accompanying details will make more sense, and thus become more interesting. People like the exciting stuff. Make sure they get it, rather than sleep or daydream until you finally decide to lay it down.   There's plenty more to be said here, but these three tips will get you considerably far. Also, practice in front of a mirror. Incorporate hand gestures and be sure to speak boldly and clearly. Radiate confidence and excitement when you're speaking. People like that.  ",

You will sound smarter when you do that.Explain things with your hands as well. Use hand gestures to do the work, as if you are painting a picture when you are speaking so that people get your context well.Use a conversational tone while speaking to an audience, and involve them as well. If you are constantly speaking if you have memorize the thing, or are reading it out, the audience loses interest.Walk around. If you are addressing to people in front of you, and are not standing behind a desk, feel free to move around while speaking. The audience feels more engaged by doing so, and you also look like an intellectual.My mother is a professor, as well as I have observed many of my teacher doing so, and I think these are great things to do when you are told to speak to people.

In fact give a rating to your personality , self-confidence and body language. ( Please do it on the basis of what you think about yourself ) This rating is required because, Rule of thumb for anyone to be successful is,believe in yourself before you ask others to believe in you. BELIEVE IN YOURSELF AS AN ORATOR. Now if you have given yourself a rating near to 7 or 9 or may be 10 then CONGO!! your journey begins. Go ahead While speaking always keep an eye contact with people.If you want people to listen to you, first listen to them. And when you do talk, focus on topics they find interesting, and paint a vivid picture \u2013 use clear, compelling words and images.Pause to take breath, allow silence sometimes.Don't take yourself too much seriously. If you enjoy speaking and communicating others listen and enjoy it too. So keep some space for humour.Improve your voice tone and volume. Don't shout , don't throw your words like a cannon, lob them like a catapult.Cool. Now after going through all these points everything is in your hand. Practice, improve yourself. Don't run long way for finding shortcuts. Final take away point is that believe, loosen up, emphasise, enjoy and most importantly: Get impressed by your words so that you can impress others.

Finally one thing is sure that nobody cares about your Gray hairs or your seniority. Only thing which matters is your knowledge if you want people to listen to you forever. So be sensible, talk wise and talk nicely and most importantly talk what is interesting for others not what you know. ",

There are a no. of things you need to keep in mind before you want people to listen to you. OBSERVE YOUR SURROUNDINGS : it is very important for you to understand that where exactly you are at that moment. What is the momentum of the place. Is the environment ambivalent, joyous or sad. This will help your brain to generate ideas and prepare your talk.BE A GOOD LISTENER: this is the foremost important thing if you want people to listen to you. You should be listening to them first. No one likes a person who just keeps on interrupting in between. Let them complete and then give your view.WELL VERSED WITH THE TOPIC : you also need to fully prepared and be aware of the facts before you start. Because lack knowledge and interest makes others disinterested too. You should be firm about your stand, well versed with all the facts and important information.BECONFIDENT: when it comes to speaking, confidence is very important. No amount of knowledge will make any difference if you don\u2019t put in front of other with confidence. People tend to listen to those who know what they are speaking and can assure that is what is true. And this can only be done with fluency and confidence.I hope this helps! If you have any other questions. Please feel free to ask. thank you! ",

            "answer_text": "Listen to them - It\u2019s a human thing. It sounds like you are not feeling heard, because you feel that others aren\u2019t listening to you.  One of the biggest lessons I have learnt in my brief 35 years is that when I feel like there is an absence of something, to offer it, give it, give that very thing, to others. That internal whinge about the things in my life that are missing, I\u2019d offer them to someone else. The whinge, I like to replace with the word hinge, a pivot point that I can swing back on my own behaviour to put me in a position of positivity and abundance mindset. When I offer to listen to others, magic happens and almost instantly, I feel better, and within a short amount of time, the person and I are in deep, respectful conversation, or if not with them, I am reaping dividends from someone else. There\u2019s a secret trick to Listening - do you want to know what it is ..? How to listen to someone, how to really Hear someone, how to feel heard \u2026 Offer this to someone. Do this - Listen to understand. At a company I once worked for, I work with tech teams that were outstanding at their craft - the cream of the crop. Some of these excellent professionals become managers, and I have found an interesting theme when they were assigned direct reports. Here is it. They couldn\u2019t listen to people. Incredibly solutions focused and driven, it was difficult for some individuals just to sit and listen, to invest in the other person, through time, patience, and comradery. They simply were out of practice in the human side of things and were very outcome focused, missing the point that the very thing that someone has to share, is the blocker for the outcome they are seeking. I put together a conversation tool to help them. It went something like this: 1/ Establish connection, trust and build rapport. \u201dI had this experience \u2026..\u201d 2/ How\u2019s it going, what\u2019s on your mind? The goal here is to listen to understand and establish what the participants dominant thought pattern might be. 3/ What are you working towards right now? Understand their what, why and how. Get curious. Ask open questions and really mine for information. 4/ Critical Step - The Secret Sauce - Repeat back to the participant what they have told you. \u201cIt sounds like \u2026. \u201c\u201dYou think/feel that \u2026\u201d\u201dBecause/so that/etc\u201d\u201dIs that right\u2026?\u201d And repeat, repeat, repeat until you can accurately retell the participant what they have told you - accurately for them, not for you. 5/ Listen for inner dialogue \u2026 the \u201cI think\u201d and the \u201cI feels\u201d Ask open, clarifying questions, that allow the participant to open up further - they do the talking, you do the listening. In the case of this particular company, I encouraged them to look for recurring themes and look for telling language. ",

            "answer_text": "First, I am not sure if you mean at presentations and speeches or among small groups such as friends, family or coworkers.  If it is speeches, most of the advice from others here is valid, the more confidence you show makes a huge difference.  It is usually easy to talk to people about topics you are very familiar or interested in because you are usually more knowledgeable and passionate about them.  If you prepare yourself and information so that you are equally as knowledgeable and appear as passionate about the topics you intend to talk about, confidence usually follows. Be clear, keep on topic, if you can make eye contact with your audience, do so, it gives a personal feeling that strikes interest, they feel more involved in your speech, and you can see by their expressions if you have their interest or are loosing it.  It gives you an idea what to focus more on, and just where there interests lie.  Do not shout, or seem too excited , but do not make them strain to hear you, move around a bit, do not seem like a robot, use pauses and changes in expression to emphasize issues.  If possible, use words, questions or slightly humorous phrases to draw the crowd into your speech, things they can relate to, this all works with friends or small groups too, though choosing topics that they are more familiar with or interested in works better, show interest in lives, everyday things as well as events.

If you mean how to get them them to listen to you and acknowledge you in general, the same advice as above, but consider why they are not listening in the first place. Are you droning on and on? Repeating yourself or the obvious? Are you adding something valuable to the conversation? There is a lot to consider, even the history with the person is important, Have you ever lied to the person before> Maybe they will no longer entertain what you say because they know you lied. If they aren't listening, it could be they are bored with the topic, or your tone may be monotonous. There are many things to consider, but generally, the listener isn't the problem, it's the talker.

There are more people who would willingly listen to you, you need to find them that\u2019s it.. Apart from this advise the main thing I have found from my life is: Look into people\u2019s eyes and talk. Dont be shy from looking into their eyes. It shows your genuine interest to talk about a particular subject and if they look down or appear uninterested you would know from their eyes and would find out when to stop talking. One more point here is - Be loud. Use your diaphragm to breathe properly and speak well. And dont scream. People hate to listen to someone who appears to be screeching to make a point clearly. Another thing is you might as well use your hands naturally as you speak. Dont make it seem that you are doing it intentionally. Most of all be genuine to the points you are speaking and speak with utmost clarity. Dont give too much detail and be to the point and precise. ",

            "answer_text": "We usually get the feeling you're talking, but nobody is listening. For people to listen you, you must listen to them first. It depends on a lot of factors like who are the audience- whether they are professionals, colleagues, friends, relatives, kids etc. and also depends on the topic of discussion. The other factor is your voice modulation which is directly related to the kind of audience you are having. For example if the audience are kids, you should talk in a more childish manner and mimicking yourself with the character you are talking about. It will make the kids more connected to you. Same applies to professionals, friends etc. Of course, the content plays a major role for the person to listen you. The words you use should be relevant and decent. It should convey the message to the other person in the most simplest way possible. Even in case of disagreement, make you point what makes you disagree with a certain point. It will make them curious why you have a different perspective and they will tend to listen to you more attentively. Other factor that is important to me, is giving them chance to respond to you. If you keep on talking ignoring there response and reactions, they will soon loose their interest in you and stop listening to you. It should be a dialogue instead of a monologue. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the other person has to talk to you. You just have give pauses and make eye contact with them to let them know that you are interested why they think. This is not the exclusive points i have mentioned but it will help you a lot. You can try it. Let me know if it helps :) Have a good Day! ",

Some people have their way of talking and communication style that casts a spell on others and others listen to them or like to listen to them. The tendency of people listening to you depends upon your reputation in the environment where you want be heard. And your reputation is made by some positive traits and habits that you posses. Thankfully, if someone does not have these traits they can be acquired by practice and changing your behavior. So, the question comes what are these traits? Now there are some things that you need to adopt and some that you need to avoid or erase if you already hove those habits. Things that are need are to avoid can be collectively called as Seven Deadly Sins of Oral Communication. They are gossiping, judging, lying, negativity, complaining, excuses and dogmatism. These things need to go, if you want to be heard by people willingly and lovingly. In contrast, there are four traits that you should adopt into your oral communication. They can be called virtues of oral communication. They are Honesty, authenticity, integrity and love. Remove the sins and adopt the virtues and people in your circle will surely listen to you. ",

Also, listen to what others are talking; nod your head often so they will feel that you are paying attention to them. 5. Use voice modulation to make your words more effective. 6.

There are tons of fashion magazines that show you how to dress.  Make sure your breath is fresh and your teeth are in good shape. You'll need to fulfill a need.  If what you say is meaningless to the person or persons to whom you are speaking, you are not going to hold anyone's attention.  Speak slowly and clearly. Don't speak loudlly unless you are trying to make a point and only do it briefly. It's called inflextion. No one likes to be yelled at.  Give examples about your point. Plan your body language by watching yourself in a mirror.  Good speakers have some animation.  Find someone that you enjoy listening to and mimic them until it is your own.  Takes practice, practice, practice. You can't MAKE people listen to you.  The best you can do is to have something to say that they want to hear. If you're talking about public speaking, better have your information together, conviction and be ready to be challenged.  You will be challenged because not everyone thinks/believes the same as you do. What I say, I have researched a lot before I speak.  I am of the firm belief that no one has to agree with me. Allllllll are entitled to their opinion.  What I speak of I have experienced or people I know well have experienced. ",

You must also come with proof, evidence, documentation, and ultimately, truth. They may still not choose to listen and you can\u2019t make them. However, if it\u2019s a matter of personal property or a violation of your person . . . they may not listen, but that\u2019s when the law comes in on your side. This is where the police and courts are involved . . . they may not listen but then they could be fined, thrown in jail or some other sentence. When it comes to children, you must apply the non-aggression principle . . . you cannot shake, hit, threaten or verbally abuse your children in order for them to listen . . . you perpetuate violence and continue the system of enslavement of abuse to false authority figures (ie the state, politicians, the financial system and etc) when they become adults.

This generally requires some combination of deep knowledge and understanding of a subject (but don\u2019t overload your audience with details!), a good sense of humor, empathy and emotional expressiveness (think Bill Clinton\u2019s speech at the Democratic convention), and sensitivity to the interests of your audience and to the rhythms of conversation (know when to hand over the podium to the other person \u2014 we\u2019ve all known people who talk too much without so much as a pause to allow the other person to get a word in, interrupt, fail to look for signs that the other person is losing interest, etc. \u2014 and seem oblivious to what they\u2019re doing).

The shortcut to meaningful influence is simple: Start with saying things worth listening to. Say those things to as many people as you can for as long as you can. By the way, without another platform to drive name recognition this isn't really a shortcut. It is the hard way. ",

Here are the Seven sins that most people do while speaking and everyone can relate to it: 1: Gossip: Speaking ill when somebody is not present. we all know perfectly well that it is not a nice habit. The person gossiping five minutes later will be gossiping about us. These types of people don\u2019t have any respect in the market.  So try not to gossip. 2: Judging: It is very difficult to listen to somebody if you know that you being judged. Judging without knowing somebody is a crime in the perfect conversation. 3: Negativity: Try to flush out negative stuff in the conversation. It\u2019s hard to listen to a negative person. So, try to add some positivity in outer world. 4: Complaining: It\u2019s the art of many people to complain, they complain about whether, people, politics or news and everything, but actually is viral misery.

What did I change? Well, I had to work on a number of ques. Body language- Research and experience indicate the same thing- minimise movements which are wasteful. For example, certain lectures don\u2019t require any leg movement but only require hand gestures. In most cases, this rule should be religiously followed; move your hands when required, while minimising leg movement.Eye contact- At a priliminary start, try avoiding direct eye contact. The best way to look confident while not having to see what others decipher of you, is to stare at the forehead and continuously look around the room, revolving around the centre. Foreheads don\u2019t reflect emotions; all other parts of the face do.Before starting- Breadth. This is called the breadth exercise. Here, right before going on stage, stand near a mirror, look at yourself and smile while doing Three sets of breadth in\u2019s and out\u2019s.Practice the speech near a mirror- A mirror is the thing which worked for me. Talk into the mirror and smile throughout the process. Trust me, it really helps.The smile quotient- Keep a light, accepting smile on your face in all non- serious cases. The crowd will relate more with you.Material- Make sure what you say makes sense.Avoid aaaaaas and uhmmmmmms. This distracts the audience, even if your material is good.Remember, a confident lie is better than a nervous truth. Play your cards accordingly.",

What you have to do it post something funny or inteligent or interesting that will catch the eye of your friends. If you do the same in real life and talk in a calm and clear way, people will listen.

Once you've determined your message, with whom you need share it, where they happen to be at this moment, and what language to speak when you get there: Stand up to be seenSpeak up to be heardShut up to hear repliesSit down to be appreciated. If you can't be persuasive, try to be entertaining. People learn more if you can trick them into learning that by which they thought themselves merely amused. Good luck with your speaking engagement.

Make a clear statement, don't begin with um or uh or \"If you want to know what I think well maybe it could be because...\" because no one will wait for you to get to your point. Just come out with it. \"I like peaches!\" or \"Miniature golf is fun!\" and see if anyone acknowledges. If they don't, then wait a bit for there to be a lull and try again. Of course it helps if you stick to the topic at hand. If they're arguing over which is better, pizza or tacos, now is not the time to reference your favorite Renaissance painter unless it's relevant to the debate. ",

Just keep your sentiments away and start with appreciating them or atleast say a little about their points so they don't feel ignored and after that you are free to state your view.

The better you are at asking deep, probing, intelligent and other-focused questions the more likely people will interact with you, which is the purpose of communication.  A more scientific answer to your question is that we all have different listening habits developed over our lifetime in our brain, body and emotions. When you tap into someone else's habits and mirror neurons, you increase the likelihood there will be a listening connection established. Of course, first you have to know your own listening habits before you can connect with someone else who may/may not share your way of listening. ",
