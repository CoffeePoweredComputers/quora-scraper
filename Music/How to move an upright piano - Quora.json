            "answer_text": "When it comes to moving any large item, you have to be careful. Yet, with something as delicate as a piano, you should know what to do so it doesn't get damaged or lose its tune. Here are some tips on moving a piano - both professionally and doing it yourself.  Doing It Yourself Pianos are extremely heavy so if you do it yourself, make sure you have a few helpers. Get yourself a pair of dolly straps. According to one expert: Varying from $50 to $100 for a pair, dolly straps can make all the difference when it comes to moving a large piano. Not only do the dolly straps help distribute the weight evenly across your upper body, but they allow you to stop for a break easily by balancing the item, and they minimize the risk of the piano edges slipping from your grasp. Dolly straps can also be particularly useful in instances where you need to maneuver the piano around tight corners or up or downstairs. Keep in mind the old saying - lift with your legs, not your back. This will help prevent injuries. Use blankets to tape the edges. This protects your piano as well as other things like walls and other furniture. Some people find it helpful to lay the piano on its side on a blanket and slide it. This protects the floor from being scratched - and the piano too. Remove parts that you can. If the legs are easily removable then go ahead and do that. It makes the weight placement more balanced and minimizes some of the extra pounds. Use Professional Movers If you want to take some of the hassles off of yourself, use a professional instead. One of the other benefits of hiring a professional is that they should be insured. Before you choose a mover, find out if they are and what the terms are. No one wants to have to file a claim but it does happen. At least with a professional mover you've vetted first, you're covered if something happens. Read reviews first so you have a good idea what to expect. Some people are not pleased no matter what. It is normal for a company to have a bad review but if there are many, especially saying the same thing, then it may be good to find another company to check out. It may not be easy to move a piano but with a few tips, you can make it a little less difficult. If you have the funds, hire the professionals so you don't have to worry. And if you do want to do it yourself, just make sure you have enough help, the proper equipment, and follow the suggestions on making it safer. ",

            "answer_text": "From house to house - the easiest and best way is to hire professional removers. It usually costs about $100. DIY - You need at least 2 muscle-bound people. Plus some strong metal ramps and a piano trolley. This is a thing a bit like a skateboard. It is very strong with strong swivel wheels. You lift up one end of the piano and slide the trolley underneath. The piano balances on the trolley which is then easily pushed wherever. Use ramps on stairs and to get the piano into the moving van. Tie the piano to the walls in the van. Use blankets or foam to protect from the ropes. Don't rely on the little wheels on the piano. They are usually useless, especially or carpet or rough ground. After you have moved it to its new home, situate it against an interior wall. Play it often using all the notes. After 6-8 weeks get it tuned. If you are in a very dry climate put an ice cream container of water inside the bottom. The lower panel has a spring lever holding it in place. ",
