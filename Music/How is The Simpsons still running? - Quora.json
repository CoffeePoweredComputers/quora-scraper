            "answer_text": "It\u2019s still running for the same reason any series keeps running: enough people watch it to satisfy the sponsors and therefore the network. TV is an entertainment medium, but the bottom line for any show, however good or bad you may think it is, is the number of people who watch it. It\u2019s very rare for a series to last without high viewership, and it\u2019s also very unusual for a series with high viewership to be canceled. The people who run TV are doing it as a business. If the money paid by the sponsor makes a profit over the cost of the series, it\u2019s a success. Enough people watch The Simpsons to make it profitable, so it continues. It\u2019s as simple as that.
