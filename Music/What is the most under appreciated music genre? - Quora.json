            "answer_text": "I have two answers, which I consider pretty close to tied in under-appreciation. First, Progressive Rock. Whether its complaining about long instrumental passages or dismissing it as self-indulgent or complaining that it\u2019s experimentation without direction or any of a dozen other complaints that I\u2019ve heard through the years, most of the public dismiss the value of this genre, even people who should know better. The fact is that while individual tracks can be one or more of these things, no individual track has to be. Some of the greatest bands and albums of all time qualify as progressive rock - the Beatles entire catalog from \u201cRubber Soul\u201d on; Pink Floyd\u2019s \u201cDark Side Of The Moon\u201d; Led Zeppelin 4 - the list goes on. By any strict definition of \u201cProgressive Rock\u201d, all of these qualify, but most people exclude them from the category just so they can criticize it. Second, Top-40 Pop Music. The way it gets dismissed as being \u201ctoo commercial\u201d or \u201clightweight\u201d or \u201coverproduced\u201d or not being made by serious musicians irritates me regularly. I contend that it\u2019s harder to craft a song-and-performance combination that appeals to a wider audience than it is to play to your own little fishbowl, and these artists deserve just as much respect as anyone else in music. Quite often, it\u2019s sour grapes because the artist in question has not been able to achieve the same success - they dismiss those who have to keep their own brittle egos puffed up. Even artists who have achieved commercial success, like Joe Jackson, and who should know better, have been known to denigrate the genre. ",

            "answer_text": "R&B I am not talking about just recent music that people consider R&B, I am talking about all of it. Going back 70+ years. The genre that spawned rock and hip hop and has influenced virtually all popular music since then is almost completely ignored Classic Soul, Philly Soul, Deep Soul, Smooth Soul, Memphis Soul, Motown, Chicago Soul/Northern Soul, Jump Blues, Doo-Wop, Funk, Proto-Disco, Disco, Post-Disco, Quiet Storm, New Jack Swing, \u201990s \u201cContemporary\u201d R&B and more are all forgotten. Right here on Quora, R&B and all it\u2019s sub genres are barely mentioned in any lists of favorite artists, albums, etc. The most viewed writer in R&B over the last thirty days (myself) has 2650 views. The most viewed writer in rock has 128,551. Other people have mentioned jazz being underappreciated, but the most viewed writer in jazz has 21,024 views. Another person mentioned heavy metal, but the most viewed writer in heavy metal has 69,169 views in the last 30 days. Even seemingly unpopular genres like opera have lots of views (16,643). R&B is treated as if it does not exist, despite being huge, incredibly diverse and the root of nearly all popular music that has come since it\u2019s creation. Frankly it is bothersome to me. For so many people to ignore such a huge amount of music that is so important, so vital and so damn good, it seems as though there is more than personal taste involved. I think a lot of the \u201cmainstream\u201d audience feels outright threatened by it, and that is a shame. Hmmm, I wonder why that might be?   ",
