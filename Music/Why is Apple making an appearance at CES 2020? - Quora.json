            "answer_text": "Apple has always had staff at CES like most other firms in the business both reviewing competitive offerings, seeing emerging trends and holding meetings as they saw fit. This year they are interested in privacy and security issues which seems to be the reason for their increased, though not large presence. Apple is a CTA member though they go their own way.

They\u2019ve attended informally, but more for finding suppliers for various needs, etc. This year, it is widely expected that Apple will attend in support of their HomeKit technology and support from third party accessories. While Apple doesn\u2019t lead in terms of the raw number of third party products supported, Apple does lead in terms of security and will likely show things like secure video that is missing from the competition.
