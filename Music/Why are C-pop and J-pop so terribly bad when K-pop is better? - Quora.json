            "answer_text": "Ever since it was proven by BTS that the k-pop group can get seriously famous and popular in the western music market, which has names like Beyonce, One Direction, John Legend, Drake, Rihanna, Taylor Swift, Katy Perry and many more, the genre started to sound more western to be more appealing for the western audience.  (Red Velvet - Psycho music video) K-pop groups and their companies now know that it is possible to get famous in the west and that\u2019s why they are trying to create content that would be considered likable for western people and send the artists to promote there. Even though the majority of them are still not able to reach the level of fame they would love to, they are still going there and showing people the variety the k-pop is hiding.  (BTS) I don\u2019t like to brag about BTS paving the way, but in this case, I would be lying if I said they didn\u2019t. They created the name for the k-pop, which no j-pop or c-pop group did for their genre. With China and c-pop, it is probably because of the political tension. You don\u2019t see many Chinese artists promoting in the US, there are just a few exceptions and none of them were able to make a decent name for the genre, because now with the hype around k-pop it is almost impossible to make people want to be interested in another genre.  (Lay - Zhang Yixing = one of the few c-pop artists who went to the US to promote with Mandarin song; needless to say, that he was linked with being part of k-pop group EXO most of the time as he is still their member.) Most of the c-pop content is not subbed for the international fans, there are no English subtitles, which would make the international fans stay and watch it when they don\u2019t understand a single word. From what I have seen so far, the performances of most of the groups are not really eye-catching in terms of dancing (especially girls). Maybe it is just me watching the wrong artists, but they care more about singing and rapping than about dancing, which is something which can bore people easily, especially when most of them are used to the k-pop style in which groups focus more on dancing.  (Rocket Girls 101 - they are one of many groups, which never made me amazed by dancing in their live performances; in the end of this post I will put a comparison with j-pop and k-pop groups) For c-pop it is mostly because they are closed country - they have Weibo which is something really confusing for the international fans and not all artists post their content on YouTube too, which is making the chance people will notice c-pop even smaller. C-pop artists usually stay within the country, because of how many people live there, that\u2019s why they are not as popular as k-pop.  (Cai Xukun - probably one of the most known c-pop soloists among the international fans) When it comes to J-pop, it is almost the same thing as with c-pop. J-pop doesn\u2019t have any representative, which would be able to go out there with music, which would catch the attention of the western music market and make the genre more popular and known.  (AKB48 - probably the most known group with hundreds of members. Just the number of members, which are under this name, makes it confusing and dissuasive for a lot of people) Many j-pop companies are satisfied when the group reaches fame within the industry and not many of them want to go to the west to promote and spread genre to the whole world. I also believe that j-pop music is just not made for the west. C-pop is more or less similar to k-pop and would have a chance to catch attention, but the style of j-pop is only for a certain group of people.  (sixTONES - one of the few groups, which I like in j-pop and which doesn\u2019t have the old stereotypical style of music, but probably none of you heard of them, right?) Not many of you know about Japanese artists unless they are part of a k-pop group. COMPARISION Rocket Girls 101 (c-pop) - I know that it may be the wish of the company they told the choreographer, but majority of this performance is just walking and simple hand gestures.  AKB48 (j-pop) - the fact is that even the girls from this group were shocked when they got to know how important the dancing is in k-pop and I believe that in j-pop they put a lot less pressure on dancing than in both c-pop and k-pop, which is visible.  ITZY (k-pop) - their dancing is on whole another level as you can see, but you can also hear that because of that, they are not as stable as the j-pop or c-pop group which focuses more on singing/rapping (but Itzy is still a rookie group, they are new to the industry and the older groups are usually more stable than them)  r1se (c-pop) - the boy groups are a bit better in dancing than the girls, as you can see there is a visible difference and the choreography actually looks quite intense.  sixTONES (j-pop)  Seventeen (k-pop)  ",
