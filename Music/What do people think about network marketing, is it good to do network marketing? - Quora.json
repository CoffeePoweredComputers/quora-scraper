            "answer_text": "A2A Yes, it is good to do network marketing. The question I have for you is why do you want to \u201cdo\u201d network marketing? Is it for the following? 1. Make money 2. Make friends 3. Make money and friends 4. Make money, friends and in time \u2013 create a business for myself that will achieve all my goals and dreams 5. Catch gullible people and push product and business plans down their throats till they choke or buy If you said yes to any of the above, let me tell you- DO NOT DO NETWORK MARKETING because you are going to sink faster than the TITANIC. But didn\u2019t you just say it\u2019s good to do network marketing Yes, and I\u2019m going to tell you why because as I have mentioned in most of my answers on network marketing; network marketing teaches you: HOW TO SELL. This is a life skill you absolutely need in today\u2019s economic war zone scenario that we all live in and network marketing teaches you just that. Granted it\u2019s not in the fancy Ivy League school way but the down and dirty way -in people\u2019s faces and it also teaches you not to burden yourself with thoughts on what people think about your business, your product or your methodology. Enroll in a network marketing company that has a solid training program and attend it religiously and implement the training the next day- on the street or, on the phone -wherever. Come back to the training's and keep growing your knowledge on the subject till you\u2019re confident you can sell anything to anybody. Once you know how to do that, go out there, create your own product, sell that and laugh all the way to the bank. I hope you find what you\u2019re looking for. ",

            "answer_text": "For me personally I feel network marketing is just a trick business,I just don't like it, I find out that the one who starts the business will live a luxurious life and earn lot Of profift , and as long as the chain is spreading the following persons earn less income compared to first and it goes on but this doesn't piss me off ,what piss me off is their fake promises to people giving some false information about their business making u feel u can do and be like them and once u r in their chain u ll then see the real business.. Now u r trapped and wt ever u paid for the fees n structure , u ll get some worthless products (let's say u paid 10rs n the product u ll get is worth rupees 3 or 4) and now u r trapped so in order to earn ur capital u have to bring in more customers by any means Or just forget about ur money Or let's say to earn more income to put in your pocket, and this cycle goes on and on. Sorry but somehow i find it kinda fraud thing . So plz clear my perception if I m wronng . Ps: it's true that u ll learn the skills to survive in this world and ur communication skills,knowlege and social approaching relationship will enhanced. But my question is, Are all the network marketing businesses same? Do all of them run after making profit without customer satisfaction ? Eg of this, lets say there are 10 people in the room (i.e, 1\u201310) no 1 starts the business n able to put no.2 n he paid \u20b91k for fees so now no2 needs to earn his capital so he convinced no.3 n this goes on till no.10 now no ten is stuck he finds out there is no profit in it so he falls in their trick he realized he has to make fool another in order to earn profit and his capital now he doesn't want to approach his friends or any of his family members.. So isn't this a trick business.. if the company don't get any subscription or people fees how he earn income to pay all this expenses for his office work, tax, workers , etc. ",
