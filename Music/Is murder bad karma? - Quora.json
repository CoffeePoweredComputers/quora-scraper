            "answer_text": "Murder is karmic. It has a cause, it has an effect, it has the person committing the act stuck between the causes that led them to that point and the effects that propagate out from it. The point of dharma is to free yourself, so that the causes that lead you to a point like that do not necessarily result in the effects that propagate forward from it. One does not have to commit murder regardless of the context, or to commit oneself to the myriad consequences that naturally follow from committing murder. Karma is not bad or good. It\u2019s like the tide; it pushes you this way or that way. If it happens to smash you against the rocks, that\u2019s not because it\u2019s bad or good; if it tosses you into a position where you are contemplating murder, not because it\u2019s bad or good. You didn\u2019t swim with the tide or against it or across it, so karma swept you where it would, and you ended up where you are. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that or right with that. Dharma means learning to swim. I highly recommend it. ",

            "answer_text": "In my tradition our ethical tenet: \u2018The Witches Wiccan Rede\u2019 states: \u2018An it Harm None, Less in Defense or The Greater Good, Do As Ye Will!\u2019 To kill another person, unless in Defense or The Greater Good, will result in negative Karma! While \u2018Instant Karma\u2019 imacts the person in this life, \u2018Karma\u2019 affects the person in the next life. You see, if in the defense of a child, the attacker is killed, there would be no negative Karma at all. Please try to understand, Karma is neither Good nor Bad. It is simply a natural process intended to teach people, by way of positive and negative reinforcement, the way to live an ethical life in harmony within our communities. Blessed Be! Storm )O( ",
