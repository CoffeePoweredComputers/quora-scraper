            "answer_text": "Tbh none of the members of BTS are dumb. I know Namjoon is smartest with an IQ of 148. Taehyung, I believe, is second due to yoongi and namjoon saying that he\u2019s actually very smart and yoongi guessed his IQ around 130. Unique and different people tend to be smarter due to their ability to think outside the box. He also has the best memory in choreography. Jimin is third because he was at the top of his class and was the class president. We suspect he had very high grades. Now for jungkook.. it\u2019s true he\u2019s good at everything but one thing - math. He joined BTS young at really didn\u2019t have time to go to school and learn which is why he may lack in some academic category, but it doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s dumb. He can easily and quickly grasp concepts. Jin once told us he had an IQ of 107. The average person IQ is 100. He is slightly above. Though may not academically, he is very smart. As we can see in Run BTS, Jin was able to use many strategies to help him win games - which is one of the reasons why I think he may be a genius - by tricking and using excellent techniques, Jin can easily win games. He\u2019s also good at rock, paper, scissors. I don\u2019t really know a lot about Hoseok\u2019s academic schooling but I did hear that he actually got very good grades while being about to write songs. So very unlikely he would have a low IQ. Hoseok talks a lot, meaning talkative people are more open with ideas and better communication skills leading to being good in the language arts category. His positive attitude leads to a clear mind instead of a more stressful and fixed mindset. Yoongi did say he wasn\u2019t doing very well at school. But he was busy producing music and lyrics. Yoongi has a calming personality which may result in a pretty decent IQ, in which a person with patience are smarter and good at thinking. In order to be a good lyric writer, he should be good at language arts, so he may lack in some academic areas because of his busy lifestyle because of stress and depression but he definitely is a genius. In conclusion, this is a dumb question because all of BTS are smart. Who cares who has the lowest IQ? But it\u2019s your question. So, with my information, I\u2019ll let you decide who in BTS has the lowest IQ. ",

            "answer_text": "It doesn\u2019t matter. IQ doesn\u2019t measure intelligence, but the potential for it, that\u2019s why it stands for intelligence quotient. Plus, many psychologists don\u2019t really think it\u2019s that important as there have been proven to be many different types of intelligence and no one is truly better than the other. Some people\u2019s strengths are other\u2019s weaknesses, but that doesn\u2019t mean those people are inept. Everyone has a talent, it ultimately comes down to hard work, grit and willpower to make someone successful (and sometimes luck). Even people considered geniuses have their struggles. All the BTS members are talented and hard-working and have the thirst to learn and constantly improve themselves. And that\u2019s what matters. And in the words of Stephen Hawking, the world\u2019s greatest physicists, when asked about his IQ, said \u201cI have no idea. People who boast about their IQ are losers. ",
