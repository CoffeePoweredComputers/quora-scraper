            "answer_text": "Hello, greetings. Roblox is absolutely against pornography on their networks. Meaning no game, no person, no group, no nothing is allowed to have any sort of adult content if you mean that by 18+. There is no such thing on Roblox since this is a game that even children play for the most part, This is why, as soon as Roblox finds such content, the creator is banned and the stuff is removed. I suggest you never do such a thing. If you have any further questions about Roblox, please ask me. You can check my profile out, message to communicate with me and of course you can follow to see what I am up to. Best regards, ImSoBilalPlayer2 ",

Usually, games as such become popular somehow, and show up on the page \u201cFriends Playing\u201d even if you don\u2019t have friends that play it. Those games are mostly terminated within minutes, thankfully. ",
