            "answer_text": "\u604b\u306e\u4e88\u611f \"koi no yokan\" In English there's no equivalent to Japanese word \u604b \"koi.\"  There's an English phrase \"love at first sight.\" This stage is similar to \u604b \"koi.\" As you know the stage of \"Love at first sight\" is not actual love (yet). We call this step as \u604b \"koi\" in Japanese. If their romance continues and reaches to the next step, \u604b \"koi\" might grow into \u611b \"love.\" Japanese language clearly defines the first step and the second. \u4e88\u611f \"yokan\" could be different meaning with an adjective: good or bad. English words like premonition or presentiment are mostly a bad prediction. But Japanese word \u4e88\u611f \"yokan\" is neutral. When two words are combined as \u604b\u306e\u4e88\u611f \"koi no yokan,\" we can sense speaker's heart beat and excitement. The speaker is hopeful about being more than a friend with him or her. ",

If you have this feeling to somebody and fortunately the other one also has the same feeling to you, then you are lucky, you guys may fall in love with each other.  But there is also another possibility that, you have this feeling to somebody, but the other person maybe is already a BF or GF of another one, even has a wife or husband, anyway that person may haven't the same feeling, or can't be with you.
