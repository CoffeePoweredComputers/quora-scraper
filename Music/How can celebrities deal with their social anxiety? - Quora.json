            "answer_text": "If they are dealing with anxiety from a social attitude instead of personal anxiety I would suggest the following: Lucid dreaming - developing your ability to become conscious during REM sleep can help. This is achieved by creating scenarios in your dreams while you are the creator. An example of this from a book I read \"a man was terrified to speak in public, he started lucid dreaming crowds and himself speaking to them and after a few weeks he was able to give speeches in his public speaking class. Before the dreaming he was paralyzed in fear\". Another man practiced doing backflips in his lucid dreams until finally he woke up one day and could do backflips. There are many examples like this but not everyone can achieve lucid dreaming. Self improvement - not giving a crap what other people think (or at least when you need to not give a crap). Advanced Personal Development Videos . Leo is a great teacher and he offers free videos on personal development. Also they could  talk to extremely talented Nutritionists that may offer supplements such as Cataplex E2 by Standard Process with Gastrex. Another could be magnesium glycinate from metagenics which may also improve relief from General anxiety. -- Note I'm not a doctor and cannot give medical advise -- ",
