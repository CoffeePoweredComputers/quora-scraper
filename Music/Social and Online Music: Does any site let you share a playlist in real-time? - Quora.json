            "answer_text": "i think that's called \"hanging out in person\" or I just use Rdio. endless playlists, 3clicks, you don't have to upload, the music is already there and i see what my friends are listening to in real time just as they can stalk me :)   looking back on my answer from a few months ago, i am fully editing it as services have developed. I prefer Rdio, no doubt, for my on-demand listening and friend-sharing (even in real time) (and i don't work there).  Here are some solutions for listening with friends in different locations (that i've used) -  Skype. (the sound isn't perfect unless you are a geek like me and figure out how to properly mic it all up...but a simple skype connection between multiple friends (phone or video) where everyone goes on mute but one party shares music, is one way i've had fun with it. This works with the skype mobile app as well, so you are not bound to the desktop. As an Rdio fan, i think a great (and likely forthcoming future move) will be a bundling of rdio & skype which takes this a step further in a way i probably have yet to imagine.Instant Messenger w/ URL sharing (desktop only) an oldie but goodiethis doesn't exist anymore, but a couple years ago I project-managed an event called \"Rock Me\" for browser plugin/ app/ comany Me.dium (now OneRiot). For the event, fans listened to music together using Rhaplinks on Rhapsody (at that time, Rhapsody was the best music subscription service available for this purpose) - fans also listened together through guided tours lead by artists and execs to websites where everyone was given a visualization of listening together, while actually listening together.SecondLife achieves the same endresult as above.the above two solutions may be underdeveloped, or too overdeveloped for music consumption today, a common problem in the music tech space, though the best problem to have. MMORPGs could be the future of listening together, if that's your ultimate goal.Games, too. online gaming offers a lot of solutions for those who want to listen to music together at the same time on different coasts",

            "answer_text": "I just launched a live music app called weeSPIN that let's you listen and share music together in real time wherever you are. No need to create rooms. Play any song, hit invite, and listen together down to the beat. We're presenting at SXSW v2v this week as a finalist.  We're also releasing location discovery features soon and we'll be working with retail and brands to build location based interactive channels. For example you can walk into your favorite store and get curated tracks delivered straight into your stream. For now the app is iOS only and it integrates with Soundcloud and our own database.  The app is free + ad-free, but we pay 4x more $$ per stream to artists than other streaming services. Love to get your thoughts. Check it out: http://weeSPIN.com/download If anyone is in Vegas Wed 7/22, we have a guest list at THE LIGHT club. Mention weeSPIN at the door and come hang!   ",
