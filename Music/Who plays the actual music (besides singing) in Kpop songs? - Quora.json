            "answer_text": "Note: Please clarify this question, it is quite confusing. There are many different ways this can be interpreted. Which idols participate in their group\u2019s composition of the songs\u2019 lyrics and music? I don\u2019t think that this is a question that needs to be addressed because there are so many groups that produce their own music. One example is Seventeen. They\u2019re known as \u201cself-producing idols\u201d. They write their own lyrics and music, come up with their choreography, and make their own arrangement and producing. In the industry, they are well known for this. Winner members Seunghoon and Seungyoon said this when Hoshi appeared on one of the episodes in King of the Masked Singer. They acknowledged this. Which idols play instruments while their group is performing? Groups that fall in this category are generally the bands. FT IslandCNBlueDay6N.flyingThe RoseNot just bands but also idol groups sometimes do as well. One example that I know of is when Chanyeol played the piano for Miracles of December and the guitar for Lady Luck (acoustic version). Who plays the actual music of the song? Meaning the instrumental part. Most companies would produce it through their people they hire. I assume that. ",

            "answer_text": "Well to begin a lot of modern music is produced with producers never having to be able to play certain music or conduct a band. In k-pop some songs are produced by non-Korean producers, sometimes the leaders in the group work to make the music, for example, RM from BTS produces a lot of the songs BTS has. Or JB from GOT7 produces a lot of their music too. The leaders don\u2019t always have to be the ones producing the music obviously, for example, Bobby from IKON makes a lot of music on his own. JYP has a band called Day6 and they play their own instruments so if you're looking for groups that play their own instruments I suggest getting into k-bands. ",
