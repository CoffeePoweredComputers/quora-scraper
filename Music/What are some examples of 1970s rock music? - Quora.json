            "answer_text": "Some of the best rock songs of the \u201870s . . ? There are no best. There are only the ones you loved. These are some of the outstanding .. okay *sigh* .. \u201cbest\u201d .. songs of the \u201970s that I loved, that had special meaning in my life. In no particular order: 25 or 6 to 4 .. Chicago The first time I heard this amazing song my best friend Joannie and I had just walked into her house from school. Her big brother was playing the album on the console stereo (!) It made me stop dead in my tracks. Those horns! That spectacular guitar! To this day it's my favorite Chicago song. Thanks, Dave Grable. \u2026 and Color My World . . . My first wedding song. Me, 15 and six months pregnant. Him, 17 and .. dazed. But both of us with hope . . . These Eyes & She's Come Undone/No Sugar Tonight .. The Guess Who One of the greatest vocalists of the \u201870s, Burton Cummings. Randy Bachman on guitar .. What's not to love? These guys meant more to me and my first husband than any other band. Wild World .. Cat Stevens This song makes me ache with nostalgia. Cat's album Tea for the Tillerman saw me through many nights as a young and lonely Army wife. Shine On You Crazy Diamond .. Pink Floyd In my humble opinion, the epitome of blues/rock songs. Their aching and soulful tribute to lost friend and band mate Syd Barrett. I listen to this song with my ears between the speakers and candles burning \u2026 It's like a sacred ritual. It puts me in the zone. Fire on High .. Electric Light Orchestra This song has only three words: the ones of the title. But the music is epic. ELO is the first band I saw in concert, 1976. Opening was this band below with their equally epic: Love is the Drug .. Roxy Music Sensual, silky-voiced Bryan Ferry had me the minute he walked onstage. A most underrated vocalist. The musicianship of this band - and this song - are outstanding. Nothing beats a sexy sax. Bridge of Sighs .. Robin Trower The bright, neon green 8-track tape (!) \u2026 All my little brother's friends wanted to borrow it. There's not a bad song on the entire album. And here's another spectacular vocalist, James Dewar. Robin Trower is (maybe) my favorite guitarist ... if I had to choose. But, I don't have to choose \u2026 so I'm not going to. Cities on Flame with Rock and Roll .. Blue Oyster Cult Uh, YEAH! .. And so was Buck Dharma's guitar. One must listen to this song \u2026 loudly. It's a prerequisite. I saw them in 1978. Lasers (when they weren't yet prominent), the music, and the first (and only!) time I went against my better judgement and tried purple mescaline .. made for a memorable experience. Don't try this at home. Hallucinations are scary. \u201c .. my ears will melt and then my eyes \u2026\u201d Still one of the greatest rock and roll songs ever. Aqualung & Locomotive Breath .. Jethro Tull Martin Barr\u2019s guitar, Ian Anderson's voice, and .. flute? It just worked, .. and rocked. Beautifully. One of the best shows I've seen - these guys at the Fox Theater in Detroit. Kashmir .. Led Zeppelin My favorite Zeppelin song was, of course, Stairway to Heaven until the double album Physical Graffiti came out. I was blown away by this song. It has my favorite John Bonham drum work and Robert Plant vocals. There are many, many more I could name but I'll stop now. .. \u201cSo let the girl .. let that girl rock and roll \u2026\u201d ",
