There are plenty of examples\u2026 \u2018\u2019 Jim Caviezel, known for his portrayal of Jesus in The Passion of the Christ, was struck by lightning during one of the film\u2019s famous scenes. While filming the Sermon on the Mount, Caviezel noticed lightning coming toward him. Luckily, Caviezel did not suffer any injuries from this particular scene \u2013 but he did sustain skin infections, pneumonia, hypothermia, and lung infections during the course of filming.\u2019\u2019 Source of the quoted paragraphs: 9 Actors Who Were Injured While on Set Brandon Lee\u2019s Death By Accident \u2026 Human Life is Priceless\u2026  Source of the picture: What Exactly Happened to Brandon Lee While Filming 'The Crow'? Brandon Lee\u2019s death was a horrible on-set accident. \u2018\u2019 With just eight days left of filming, Brandon Lee walked on to the set of The Crow on March 31, 1993, ready to work, as always. The young actor had gotten the role after big names like Christian Slater and Johnny Depp hadn\u2019t worked out and had been working himself to the literal bone every day doing his own stunts and enduring long days along with a harsh working environment. But Brandon remained in good spirits throughout filming. The Crow was going to provide a career-redefining role that would allow him to break free of only being known as Bruce Lee's son. And just a week after filming was scheduled to end, Brandon was set to marry his girlfriend, Eliza Hutton. But that day during filming, fellow actor Michael Massee, who played the character Funboy, aimed and shot a gun directly at Brandon, as the script called for. However, once the director yelled \"cut,\" everyone realized that Brandon was not moving and was rapidly losing blood from a small hole in his abdomen. \u2018\u2019 Source of the quoted paragraphs: What Exactly Happened to Brandon Lee While Filming 'The Crow'? Art Scholl\u2019s Death and overweight camera impact on the plane (Real Goose)  Source of the picture: Tragedy of the real Goose who died making Top Gun \u2018\u2019 Much of the fancy flying you see in Top Gun is performed by skilled stuntmen. But even for experienced pilots, there\u2019s always an inherent risk. Art Scholl was one such pilot. He died on set while attempting to execute a move with his plane known as a flat spin. Tragically, the camera equipment mounted on the plane added too much unexpected weight, causing it to spin out of control and crash into the ocean below. Scholl, a seasoned flight instructor with his own aviation school, was 51 years old.\u2019\u2019 Source of the quoted paragraphs: 12 Actors Who Died During Production ",

            "answer_text": "The destruction in the 'Fast and Furious' movies would have cost more than $500m in real life  Scene from the Fast and the Furious Source: Fast and Furious | Facebook Let's be honest: If the \"Fast and Furious\" series were real life, the team would have demolished many of our cities and caused insurance companies and taxpayers a pretty penny. In case you were wondering what the price tag would theoretically be, , which is run by Halo Insurance Services, watched all seven movies to figure out the total cost. (No word if they included the short films.) The tally came up to $527 million in damaged property. Considering the eighth and not-yet-final installment \"The Fate of the Furious\" is coming out on April 14 and takes place in New York, the costs will only increase. It also discovered: 169 regular cars were damaged, 142 regular cars were destroyed and 37 \"special\" cars \u2014 including custom cars, helicopters and, at one point, a tank \u2014 were destroyed. Let's also not forget that the upcoming trailer for \"The Fate of the Furious\" features a submarine, which we are betting will also be wrecked. Source: Fast and Furious The most expensive car that was destroyed was a Lykan Hypersport by W Motors during \"Furious 7.\" (Spoiler alert: It was used to jump buildings in Abu Dhabi.) It costs about $3.5 million.53 buildings were damaged, 31 buildings were destroyed and an additional 432 items were damaged.Though Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew are superhuman wrecking machines for the good guys, they caused way more financial damage than the bad guys.So far, villain Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) has caused the most mayhem of any individual. During his opening sequence in \"Furious 7,\" he blasted his way through a hospital \u2014 and he didn't stop there. He is responsible for $187 million in damages to date.As the stakes got higher throughout the film series, so did the total cost of damages. However, since the films are not in chronological order, it could be argued that the team got less reckless over time.",
