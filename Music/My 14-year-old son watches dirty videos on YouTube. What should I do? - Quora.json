            "answer_text": "Relax. It won\u2019t kill him. Close the door and leave him alone. That\u2019s the advice. Now, gird your loins for some serious thinking. I\u2019m not going to dance around he with a lot a lot of generalized homilies about \u201cgood parenting\u201d. What you need here is explicit advice on what you perceive as a problem. Don\u2019t share this answer with your children if you don\u2019t want them to view prurient materials on the internet. It\u2019s too easy a thing to do and an answer like mine will only increase their ability to access pornography. I\u2019ll tell you how to stop them from viewing anything that doesn\u2019t suit you later, but first you need to get some perspective on the issue. I\u2019m going to only talk about boys because the question was about a son, but everything I say applies equally to girls. Like most 14-year-old boys, he has or will soon start masturbating. He is going to do it whether you like it or not. If you punish, mock, shame or otherwise discourage him, you could damage him emotionally. Accept this simple truth: The boy is going to jerk off. Physiologically, psychologically and emotionally, it\u2019s one of the healthiest things he can do. If left to his own devices, he will masturbate exactly as much as he needs to in private, and then stop. If you make it a crime in your home, it will only goad him to rebel and defy your authority. Such repression leads to fetishism and antisocial behavior, and possibly violence. If you don\u2019t want him to become a fetishist, an exhibitionist or a sexual predator, then let him get what he needs and don\u2019t hassle him. You can talk to him all you want, but it\u2019s best to only answer questions posed to you. Of course, this also requires that you have established a policy of open communication without judgment. Say, \u201cYou can ask me anything. That\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.\u201d If you say that often enough, and follow through by not pouncing on him when he asks an embarrassing question, the questions will come at exactly the right time. If he is afraid to ask a pertinent question, it means that you have failed to establish trust, and that\u2019s on you. Right. So, your son has repaired to a private place to beat his meat without fear of intervention or scorn from you. While he pleasures himself, he will most likely want to view images of naked people. Sometimes the naked people will be engaged in sexual activity. Before the internet, there were videos, but few young people had a video player, monitor and access to recorded materials for their private use. Until the internet, nearly all \u201cstroking material\u201d was in print form starting with the invention of the printing press. Before that, \u201cdirty pictures\u201d and literature were drawn and written by hand. Do you get it yet? There have always been \u201cdirty pictures\u201d and salacious writing because there has always been a demand for something to look at while one masturbates. If such materials are available , and a young man knows about them, and he knows how to acquire them, he will get them unless he is prevented from doing so. When a lad\u2019s natural curiosity and urges are thwarted, he substitutes something less explicit as a masturbation aid. Boys in the late 19th and early 20th centuries scanned catalogs with ads for women\u2019s undergarments. Purloined panties and bras, preferably unwashed, will be smelled and fondled, or even worn. If you want to avoid having your son become a fetishist, you had best let him have unfettered access to whatever stimulates him while he is wanking. YouTube? Be thankful if that is the only type of \u201cdirty videos\u201d he\u2019s watching. I\u2019ve never seen anything on YouTube that even approaches the level of depraved, explicit portrayal of sexuality readily available on sites like Tumblr. On such sites, you\u2019ll be able to see, for free, millions of photographs and video clips that are teasers put out by hardcore pornographers to lure you to their pay sites. If you\u2019re stupid enough to follow the links from there to their main sites, you will often be assaulted with numerous pop-up malware pages that can poison your operating system and compromise your security. That\u2019s what you have to prevent impressionable minors from viewing, not the kind of soft-core cheesecake and occasional sex scene from an X-rated movie they allow on YouTube. Dirty pictures? About a year ago I noticed that YouTube had loosened up a lot with adult material. It used to be that you couldn\u2019t show anything that you couldn\u2019t get away with on cable TV. Recently, though, I\u2019ve noticed a slew of clips from, and even full-length, soft-core porn movies, the kind of thing that was rated \u2018X\u2019 in previous decades, but is now freely available on some cable TV channels. A lot of this stuff comes from Italy, Germany and Russia. It\u2019s somewhat raunchy, but mostly suggestive, with long stretches of bad acting between brief sex scenes. It\u2019s pretty tame for the most part, but there is a fair amount of full-frontal nudity, both male and female. (One of the best ways to distinguish mild sexual content from the most explicit type, without watching the whole thing, is pubic hair. If an exposed groin is never shown, or if it is, and it has hair, then it\u2019s not likely to be hardcore porn. Porn actors, all of the women and most of the men, remove most or all of their pubic hair.) Above all, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve never seen anything on YouTube that offended my sense of human decency. There is nudity and consensual adult sexuality, but they still suppress anything that might be illegal and a fair amount of explicit stuff that is not, but might freak out parents like you. The \u201cworst\u201d thing I\u2019ve ever seen was a full-length Russian movie about a middle-aged divorc\u00e9e with a teenage daughter, portrayed by an underdeveloped adult actress. (I watch foreign language movies on YouTube to practice understanding speech and advance my ability to speak. It\u2019s easier than studying books.) The mother in the Russian movie had a live-in boyfriend who is seduced by the precocious daughter. They showed the man having simulated coitus with both women, but he was never shown with an erection. (There was no oral or anal sex depicted.) The only part I found \u201ctoo much\u201d was the dramatic resolution of the film, the formation of a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois. (Yikes! \u2026or more appropriately, \u201c\u0411\u043e\u0436\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0439!\u201d) My point is that there was nothing in the film that might induce someone to become a sexual predator or a fetishist. All three characters had sexual urges and they acted on them. I found the possibility of same-sex incest quite distasteful, but if a young person saw this and asked a parent, \u201cIs this kind of thing OK?\u201d, it would behoove that parent to thoroughly discuss their views on the topic of incest, including the differences between the norms in different cultures. You can\u2019t instruct your son properly if you refuse to talk about things you don\u2019t like, even if they gross you out. Enough of that. You still might want to prevent your son from viewing women\u2019s unclothed bodies. OK. Take away his computers and his phone. If you are not prepared to \u201cgo Amish\u201d, install a mechanism to filter out content you don\u2019t like on all internet devices to which you allow him to have access. You can get \u201cparental control\u201d software for this, but be careful because a lot of apps are really malware. This is the \u201cChinese solution\u201d that prevents the Chinese and other residents of authoritarian countries, such as theocratic states, from using Facebook and Twitter. Go ahead; be a Nazi if that\u2019s what it takes to maintain your personal standards of morality in your household. Otherwise, be cool and let the boy have his porn! ",

            "answer_text": "You came to the right guy, because I watch a TON of internet porn and can probably give you a clearer idea of the landscape and what you need to pay the most attention to. So, there\u2019s a couple of things to consider: First, what kind of videos are we talking about here? If we\u2019re talking about just plain old guy-on-girl or girl-on-girl (heck, even guy-on-guy), then that\u2019s pretty vanilla in the big scheme of things and probably nothing to worry about.Now let\u2019s go off the beaten path a bit: there\u2019s a lot of stuff out there with 30-on-1 encounters, various unwieldy implements designed for these sorts of occasions, use of every bodily fluid you can imagine, use of every bodily opening you can imagine, hypnotic stage shows, assorted roleplaying and scenario fetishes, participants who are well past Social Security age, bondage, domination, and costumes of everything from anime cosplays to clowns to Santa and his elves and back. These are things that may raise an eyebrow here and there, but again, nothing I\u2019d consider especially problematic.Then we get into the REALLY disturbing stuff, which mainly falls into two categories: people dressing up in animal suits (try and envision Fraggles going at it), and pretty much anything you\u2019ll find in Japanese stuff. There\u2019s something really wrong with a society that sells used women\u2019s panties in vending machines on train platforms, and that unique approach to common decency has definitely found a home in Japan\u2019s brand of adult cinema. These are the only things I\u2019d say you ought to be leery of him looking at.Also, please let me know where on YouTube he\u2019s looking at this stuff, because while it\u2019s fun finding an unintentional \u201cslip\u201d of body parts you\u2019re not supposed to see in public settings, or people having \u201creactions\u201d on turbulent roller coasters or other amusement park rides, I haven\u2019t found that YouTube is generally the best place to find videos that might be considered objectionable by the kinds of people who show up at parent/teacher meetings. Usually I need to have a good (and regularly updated) antivirus program before I can even load the sites that have the good stuff, so if you find any cool links, please send them along.I hope this helps, and please let me know if you have any other questions!",
