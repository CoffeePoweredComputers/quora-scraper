Please feel free to give your views regarding these theories in the comments. \u2018BE' is said to be the most \u2018BTS-esque\u2019 album till date. All seven members are playing a huge part in various aspects of the production of this album. Not just song writing and production, but also directing, visuals, wardrobe, album art etc. So I think this album will be something filled with their raw emotions, feelings and thoughts. This seems to be an attempt to retain and express their purity as artists. And I think that is what the concept photo of the album also depicts.  ( Image fromBigHit Entertainment (@BigHitEnt) | Twitter ) We see all the members sitting together in a room surrounded by various instruments. This could possibly be referring to the fact that they have been highly involved in the production of the album. The room looks like a cozy area, something warm(I don\u2019t know how to phrase this properly) and could possibly mean that the members will be giving an insight to their real selves, their vulnerabilities, insecurities etc. This also ties to the possibility that this album refers to Carl Jung\u2019s Map of the soul philosophy[1] . BTS\u2019s previous albums have been heavily influenced by Jungian philosophies. In the Map of the soul : Persona, BTS has dealt with their Persona and Anima-Animus. In MOTS7, the concepts of Shadow and Ego have also been dealt with. And now what is left is  The Self. So, I think that this album could be about the process of Individuation . About identifying their self by coming in peace with their Persona, Shadow and Ego. This video explains it well:  Also, the members have said that the album has a theme \u2018Life goes on\u2019. This could be influenced by the dark times we are going through right now. I guess the album would be a bit dark, but still filled with hope that we will come through this and find light at the end of the tunnel. The members have mentioned that a track similar to \u2018Spring Day\u2019 might be in this album. Spring day has the message that though we have to go through dark times, we can find happiness and light if we keep hope. Twitter Armys have got down to making some theories. The possibility that this era could be linked to the Wings era(which I guess is BTS\u2019s most iconic era) is pretty intriguing.

            "answer_text": "Lets see\u2026 I remember getting excited when Bighit announced the album on weverse. As far as I remember, the announcement said that this album is going to be the most BTS-ISH album. Now what exactly does big hit mean by BTS-ish. Well it definitely means something which shows the members originality and style. I pondered a lot on it and there can be many explanations to bts-ish its possible that the new album is something like BTS\u2019s first ever concept. Yes I\u2019m talking about No more dream, Dark and wild era. Idk why but the first thing that came to my mind when I heard BTS-ish was the N.O and No more dream, Danger vibes. I\u2019m not sure but IF this comeback is like the old days it\u2019s gonna be BIG. Maybe even bigger than MOTS: 7. I personally really love old bts songs like paldogangsan, we on, born singer, what am I to you, does that even make sense so yeah if they do this type of concept I\u2019m not gonna survive. Just imagine if jungkook raps.Another way of interpreting Bts-ish can be a bit more softer side of bts. Something like I need you from where their fame started. Something like I need you, run, young forever. Just 7 boys who are running towards their dreams and enjoying life. I think this concept describes bts well too. Maybe they do a cheery concept like boy with luv, idol or dna.Another thing which I have heard is that this album is self produced. So tbh I really don\u2019t know what to expect. On hearing self produced my mind automatically thinks of spine breaker mv. It was just the guys having fun and joking off but at the same time giving a really important message. Maybe we can expect something more like that.in conclusion, I have no idea what to expect. Ngl I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s more like no more dream or mic drop because I love that side of them. I don\u2019t think we can predict anything the boys do. In my opinion bts dark and revolting concept>>>> bts cheery concept. But again, I can\u2019t predict anything. Let\u2019s wait for the teasers then maybe i\u2019ll edit this answer. I wanna see a more raw side to them Ok so i just finished writing this whole thing when I got to know that the name of the title track is out. So yeah the title is called LIFE GOES ON. Ok so according to the name of the song I feel like it\u2019s going to be an uplifting/motivational song. \u2018life goes on\u2019 that somehow gives the idea that no matter how hard times are, life goes on and it\u2019s gonna be fine. This is just my interpretation of the title but again, it\u2019s bts so I can\u2019t say Idk I\u2019m right or wrong. I\u2019m eager for the teaser to come out\u2026.(and nervous too)   these are totally my opinions so pls don\u2019t hate. Hope I helped ~ peace. ",
