            "answer_text": "Practically everyone who wasn't born a gifted opera singer will strain when they climb the high notes. That's fairly common. But there are definitely things you can do about that to help. First of all most people don't know how to breath correctly when singing. Your disphram muscle is directly below your lungs just above your stomach. Place your hand over it now please. It's cool I can wait. *one minute later. Alright when you inhale it shouldn't collapse inwards. It should actually expand. You'll collect more air when you do this. It might feel strange at first but I promise you are doing yourself a favor right there. Plus bear in mind that boys voices are drastically changing around your age. It may take a year or two before mother nature decides what section she's gonna need you to be during the choir concert. Don't despair. Instead practice, practice and then practice some more. Sing every opportunity that you get. Garage singing is fun as well as gymnasiums. They create a cool echo effect. ",

            "answer_text": "I would advise not trying to force your voice to hit the note you want if it is painful. That can definitely damage your voice. However, there are things that can help such as trying to keep the sound open. You want the sound to come from your core and not your throat. Try to take low breaths starting down by your stomach as opposed to your chest if that makes sense. Try dropping your jaw to do this. Doing warm ups and exercises are definitely helpful for me. Exercises like singing ascending patterns such as this one can be helpful.  I do this warm up a lot. Though the video does not hit very high notes, you continue the pattern up to higher notes and gradually improve your range over time. Personally, this warm up has helped me to improve my lower range. Another tip is the bubbling technique. it sounds a little weird, but if you have a straw in a water bottle and sing through it, it will help you practice sustaining the notes you sing. One more thing that is helpful as a warm up for me to reach high notes is doing sirens. I\u2019ll slide up to a high note then down, then up to a higher note, then down, then up to my highest note then slide back down as low as I can go. I hope that makes sense. I hope this was helpful to you. :) ",
