            "answer_text": "S\u00f3lstafir - Fjara (2011) Seldom have I heard the anguish of a broken heart done so perfectly in a song. And you don\u2019t have to understand a word of Icelandic (I don\u2019t) to feel what this is about. A genre of its own and a song in its own class.  Witchcraft - Deconstruction (2012) Legend is in my opinion one of the best rock albums in history, if it had been made in the 70s it would have been legendary in reputation as well. This incarnation of Witchcraft had the perfect musicians to complement Magnus Pelander's quirky genius. This song has everything I want in a song: Evocative lyrics, great rhythm, diverse and tempo\u2019s, great guitar work and solo\u2019s.  The Temperance Movement - Pride (2013) What a song, it\u2019s like the best parts of the 70s and 90s reincarnated into this band. From the longing start of the song with these sweet vocals to the power and raw emotion in the climaxes this song takes you on a journey.  ",
