            "answer_text": "A type of legend. A key signature defines \u201cthe collective sharps and flats defining a composition\u2019s key, placed immediately after the clef that begins a staff. As applies to the diatonic Ionian and Aeolian modes, each key signature corresponds to both a major scale and its related minor scale. To improve readability, a key signature\u2019s accidentals are staggered diagonally down the staff in the following order: Key signatures with sharps: F\u266f, C\u266f, G\u266f, D\u266f, A\u266f, E\u266f, B\u266f. Key signatures with flats: B\u266d, E\u266d, A\u266d, D\u266d, G\u266d, C\u266d, F\u266d.\u201d A scale\u2019s key defines the musical base, or center, around which a composition or song is written. The key includes a set of notes (including a keynote) that, when taken together, define the song\u2019s underlying scale. As such, the key determines the key signature. ",

            "answer_text": "Key signatures are the pattern of which notes are flatted or sharped identifying the underlying scale. It is called a signature because it identifies the key. Alas, it does not uniquely identify the key, because the starting place within that scale determines the mode. ",
