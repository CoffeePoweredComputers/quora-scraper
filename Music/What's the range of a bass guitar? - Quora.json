Watch out, because the bass is a transposing instrument - it transposes by an octave in that it sounds an octave lower than written. Info on that here.  ",

            "answer_text": "It honestly depends on the bass. Off the top of my head, Fender basses usually have the least amount of frets compared to other brands. A 4-string can go from a low E all the way up to a Eb on the G string 20th fret. A 5-string can go from the low B to the same G string Eb on the 20th fret. Now that\u2019s Fender. Ibanez and other bass makers makes bases with at least 25 frets giving you a wider soloing range. ",
