            "answer_text": "By \u201cthe earlier composers\u201d presumably you mean famous composers in the classical tradition, like Beethoven, Mozart, etc. How many classical composers do you think the average person can name? If you\u2019re the average schmoe, maybe you can name five. Maybe you recognize the names of another half dozen more, but you probably aren\u2019t really familiar with their music, and you couldn\u2019t identify them as the authors. Classical music buffs, obviously, can name more, but the point is fame, in part is secondary to SELECTION BIAS. People \u201cknow\u201d the names of composers they\u2019re actually exposed to. Today, 300 years later, only the music most popular and greatest composers of their respective eras are widely performed. Audience for large scale orchestral performance is just tiny today. Most people don\u2019t listen to that kind of music at all. The overwhelming majority of composers of any period just never really become famous and aren\u2019t remembered by the public. The overwhelming majority of \u201cearlier\u201d composers aren\u2019t famous now (and never were even in their lifetimes). Conversely, if you want to consider contemporary songwriters as \u201ccomposers\u201d (and really. . .that\u2019s what they are), then I think they\u2019re probably more famous than historically well known classical/baroque/Romantic composers. IE, The Beatles are more famous than Boccherini. Taylor Swift is more famous than Stravinsky, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Rachelle. I don\u2019t know for sure but i may have some opinions. These days, in 2020, there is a profound difference in the way music is presented to the public. I believe the age of technology has done marvels, but also made us a victim of 15 minute soundbites concerning all issues including music. Many are not, including me,are not aware of the contribution modern composers have offered. No one has time unless they are dedicated to seek these composers out. Its easy to fall into a comfort zone. Being satisfied with composers and their works that have sustained them. The radio stations offering classical music have dwindled to practically nada. Its easy to fall under the spell of Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and early modern music and stick with the known, avoiding the unknown. People just dont have the time. especially now, with this craziness, the last issue we are interested in is appreciating these contributions. Including myself. If one is a Music Major, like I was, then you\u2019ve got a chance to be introduced to modern music. Its really a damn shame. Youre probably right. But it wud take a person with more experience then myself in the area of psychology or historical anthropologists who can better explain this phenomena. It is a shame, thats for sure ! ",
