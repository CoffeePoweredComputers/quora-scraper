            "answer_text": "Back then, girl group & boy group interactions were more common. There was a group called Co-Ed with boy group SPEED & girl group F-veDolls. 2NE1 & Big Bang had a song together called Lollipop. At the end of the year awards, there would be special stages where collaborations between a gg x bg (which I had always LOVED and looked forward to!) were performed. Of course, we have KARD right now who are doing well, but are not very popular in Korea due to the co-ed concept as compared internationally. A big & obvious reason that this doesn\u2019t happen anymore is because of drama. You put attractive girls with attractive boys and have them together all day almost everyday. You don\u2019t think at least one or two of them will catch feelings? Do you think it\u2019a all peaceful when they\u2019re practicing as well? Another reason, and I hate this one so much, is because of fans. Fans nowadays are so jealous, mean, & possessive. Just look at how fans act when dating news break. They get mad, depressed, sent hate, and act crazy thinking \u201chow can she steal my Oppa?!\u201d As if they had a chance with them to begin with. They can\u2019t even live normal dating lives because if they do date, they can\u2019t go on actual dates. They have to stay indoors basically locked up at their houses for \u201cdates\u201d, can\u2019t order in food because of risk of being found out, have to sneak in and out, and risk their careers and reputations for a little bit of happiness. Unfortunately, entertainment companies use fans\u2019 obsession to their advantage and create this \u201cidol image\u201d where it makes the idol seem readily available to fans and that they might really have a chance to get together with their idol. The whole \u201cI\u2019ve never dated in my life\u201d may be true for some idols, but I doubt a lot of them are. With this image, it makes fans even more spoiled and brings out this ugly culture in Kpop. Even nowadays, if a girl and guy idol look at each other, fans freak out! All this shipping nonsense is just as crazy. It\u2019s sad that we can\u2019t have idols freely interact with each other even though they are just human too. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it\u2019s because the Kpop industry hasnt quite figured out the proper formula to produce and market coed groups the way they have for single gendered groups. These companies know what to do in order to create the best groups possible when it\u2019s a boy group/girl group. But historically, co-Ed idol groups have always fallen short and it seems like Korea just hasn\u2019t quite figured out why. In the late 90s when the hallyu wave was just starting to emerge, there were a few coed groups that saw success like Roo\u2019ra, Cool, and Koyote but they weren\u2019t technically considered idol groups. A few companies have attempted co-Ed idol groups over the years but most weren\u2019t successful and didn\u2019t last long. Co-Ed school is a notable group that at least gain attention and saw some success as a co-Ed group. They debuted in 2010 with 6 boys and 4 girls.  But even they didn\u2019t last very long. The company eventually split the group in to two subgroups with the girls as F-ve dolls in 2011 and the boys as Speed in 2012. Then they stayed permanently as separate groups until the end of their contracts. I think so far, as co-ed idol groups go, KARD is probably the most successful attempt. Idk what DSP Media pulled, but for once they\u2019re doing something right with a group of theirs. KARD has gained a massive international fanbase, especially in South America. They\u2019re probably one of the more well known Kpop groups internationally, but their Korean fanbase isn\u2019t quite there yet. It seems like for now, Korea just hasn\u2019t opened up to the idea of coed groups as much as international fans have and because of the lack of success companies have had in the past, many companies today are hesitant to debut coed groups.
