            "answer_text": "I myself am a Kpop fan I don\u2019t obsess over it I listen to lots of songs in different languages and I don\u2019t plan leaving the fandom any time soon maybe when I\u2019m older but here are my tips on how to stop. Delete every picture of your bias and group from your phone So every Kpop fan has some pictures of their bias or idols on their phone maybe as a lock/home screen. I have about 5 tiny compared to other right? Anyway delete all them and distance yourself from them.Remove Kpop things from your Instagram Feed If you have Instagram you should do this one. I have two Instagram accounts, a fan account & a personal one. My personal one has no Kpop in it whatsoever but my fan account is full of Kpop and a little bit of Western celebrities. Anyway when you see something Kpopish that comes up on your feed click on not interested and remove Kpop from your suggestion list and remove Kpop from your suggestion list. Don\u2019t remove everything leave a little just not a lot.Do other things Okay even sometimes I like spending hours looking at memes and opinions and different groups but stop. Do something else go out, go for a walk or just read anything that will distract you for a while.Listen to other songs You can listen to some Kpop songs but try to keep it less. When I first got into Kpop my playlist was 95% Kpop 5% other. However it\u2019s gone down and now my playlist has changed 60% Kpop 35% English 5% Other. Still really high Kpop but it\u2019s an improvement. Try listening to songs other than Kpop and have s good balance.Stop believing you will get married to your \u201cOppa\u201d To daydream is one thing I admit I have daydreamed about meeting them but never marrying them, but if you do stop. I\u2019m guessing your not Korean can\u2019t speak Korean or don\u2019t live in Korea you will most likely be extremely lucky to even see them in concert forget talking to them.If you start wishing you were Korean or show at signs of becoming a Koreaboo STOP Now even at one point I started thinking what must it be like to live in Korea? And then I realised that was a warning sign I was like what the fuck snap out of it! Obviously they weren\u2019t major thoughts I didn\u2019t wish I was korean but I was afraid I\u2019d be labelled as a Koreaboo when I\u2019m not so I cut down my Kpop time and those thoughts went away eventually. Be happy with who you are.Realise not every Korean person looks like an Idol I\u2019m not gonna lie when I was first this naive girl who got into Kpop I was like are all Koreans this good looking? Because I never saw an ugly idol and then I realised that not every Korean looks like that. Some idols have PS some don\u2019t but most idols bleach their skin and do their eyes and do extreme diets. In Korea I\u2019m pretty sure almost all products have bleaching properties. Most Korean people don\u2019t look like that okay? Every race, skin colour, background, ethnicity and religion is beautiful not just one.Realise how insecure it makes people feel I\u2019m pretty sure most not all people have thought wow their bodies are so thin how do they keep it that way?! I myself have thought this and have extreme dieted I don\u2019t want to look korean or be Korean I just wanted a thin body like idols. If it makes international fans feel that way imagine how it makes Koreans people. Korea is already so harsh on looks young students get PS sometimes and starve themselves.Kpop is not perfect and is sometimes dark This is something every Kpop fan should know. Idols go on harsh diets to maintain their bodies or else Knetizens will hate on them. They feel so insecure and feel the need to work so much they barely sleep. There are stalkers and saesangs who are creepy af and haters I can\u2019t imagine the type of life Kpop idols live. Some entertainment companies such as SM work their idols and trainees to the death. There used to be and sometimes still are slave contracts and some girs are molested idols are blackmailed and blacklisted by their company.You don\u2019t know an idol personally or what they actually do An idol as to live up to their innocent image. But most will probably masterbate, drink, watch porn (not all), be intrigued by the member of the opposite sex or engage in sexual activities. Live with it it\u2019s their life.Kpop can be extremely fake Like another person said sometimes not all the time but sometimes Kpop can be fake. The way an idol act can be scripted and fake. Like if your are going to debut in a group your company will tell you to take on the role of the evil maknae. Or to be the happy cheerful member but behind the cameras you won\u2019t always smile and will go through hard days.Kpop isn\u2019t your life Don\u2019t become that type of perosn that is hell bent on going to Kpop concerts, travelling to Korea spends all their money on tickets and Kpop merch and looks down on Western music and only prefers Korean music. There is more to life Kpop is just a little hobby.You will slowly lose interest as you grow older I think I will too maybe I\u2019ll listen to a few songs but I won\u2019t stan any groups I\u2019ll probably get sick of the cheesy lyrics about love.The sad truth is your favourite idol may like you because your a fan but they don\u2019t actually know you and you won\u2019t be important to them At the end of the day your just someone who supports them and gives them money nothing more.You don\u2019t have to give up Kpop just don\u2019t obsess over it and just see it as another genre not a life style",

            "answer_text": "Live in South Korea and assimilate into Korean society. I was once a big kpop fan. Then I had a chance to live there. Every day you see people with almost the same features as the artists. Every day you see billboards and advertisements of Korean artists. Every day you hear their music. Every day you hear their language. Every day you\u2019re in Korea. Must be a dream come true, huh? It started to die down on me when I began to realize that for Koreans, kpop is only for middle and high schoolers. It\u2019s a child thing. Something to scream about. Something to spend your free time on when you\u2019re young and carefree. After that it becomes something corny. Even uncool. Something that adults (or people who consider themselves adults) just wouldn\u2019t do\u2014there are so much more important things to think about. And then you hear stories about how hard kpop artists work. Like no-sleeping-at-night-till-you-perfect-the-dance-routine hard. Like putting-up-with-the-whims-of-your-superiors-without-a-say hard. Like worrying-about-what-other-people-think-about-you-all-the-time hard. Like having-to-do-long-overtime-hours-every-single-day-and-then-still-have-to-drink-with-the-boss-and-colleagues-till-dawn hard. Then the day after that it\u2019s still-have-to-go-to-work-at-eight-in-the-morning hard. But then it\u2019s also work-that-barely-pays-you-you\u2019d-wonder-if-it\u2019s-even-worth-it hard. And it\u2019s also every-day-press-repeat-it\u2019s-all-just-too-exhausting hard. You believe all these stories about kpop because it happens to you. It happens to your friend. It happens to almost every single person you meet. This kind of hard is the norm. And then you realize you obsess so much about kpop because they show you exactly what you want to see. A world that is almost perfect. A world that is all pretty and handsome. A world full of glitters and flicker and flash of a thousand lights. The high life. But then k-world\u2019s reality is not perfect at all. It\u2019s almost as if someone suddenly poured cold water on you and you grasp for breath and then it all sinks in. This is reality. This is \u2018Hell Joseon\u2019. There is no perfect. Would you still be obsessing over the same old imperfect world you\u2019ve been living in all your life? I don\u2019t think so. P.S. I still like korean music. But I prefer indie music now. And some ballads/acoustics/duets. ",
