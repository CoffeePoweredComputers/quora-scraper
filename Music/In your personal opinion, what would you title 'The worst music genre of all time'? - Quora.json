            "answer_text": "So many too choose from. I confess that the music I listen to is mostly 60s 70s with some 80s like pixies/husker du/JD/ Wire and I don't mind the odd Radiohead song. I can't say I bother investigating too much modern stuff as being 56 I doubt someone like Billy Eilish is writing her songs to relate to me. To me at least the worst types of music would be post grunge ( Matchbox 20,Live,Nickleback,bush,the guys who sang \u201c don't give up\u201d and many others)these guys took the template from nevermind and sucked last gasp out of it until even nevermind sounded stale for being ripped off so many times.Often these songs were miserable just for the sake of living within the established template. Anybody who took the route of singing like Kurt Cobain or Eddie Vedder without even bothering to do their own thing contributed to the feeling that this genre was eating itself for sake of radio play and fleecing the masses. In this modern era individualism and uniqueness is not rewarded especially by a music industry still smarting from when the artist had more control ( 60s70s). R and B is another area that I find hard to fathom. It is certainly a more multicultural form of music based in the new world so an older white guy like me is not their target I guess.It does have certain addictive qualities and some songs are definite guilty.pleasures like the goin' solo song and many many others is not however an intellectual challenge and some of the songs by artists like Gwen Stefani (holler back girl)katie Perry(firework) The one where the singer keeps saying \u201cyou are beautiful no matter what they say\u201d are an assault on the ears. When it comes to Rap I'd say I might leave it alone, it's been around since I was young and in its infancy I didn't mind public enemy and de La soul. It's very commodified now but has its place as less a form of music and more an outlet for black America to express it's likes and dislikes.it is also very marketable to other ethnicities with a want to portray a badass slant to their persona. Anyway the modern era has presented diminishing returns to the music lover and my age prevents me at least from being an expert onup to date stuff. But if I am pinpoint something I do know about and was in the thick of that was very ordinary and sucked it would be post grunge. ",
