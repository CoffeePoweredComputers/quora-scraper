            "answer_text": "It can mean three different things: 1. The collection of notes that are always sharped or flatted, also known as the \"key signature\". 2. The chord that serves as the final resolution, resolving the musical tension that precedes it.  This chord is the tonic, or the I chord. 3. The particular scale used in the piece: you might say a tune is in \"D Dorian\" or \"A blues\". For most popular music in a major key, the three will be the same.  The key signature may have two sharps, the chord progression may resolve to a D major chord, and the notes within the piece don't have accidentals within the measures - it uses only notes 'natural' to the key signature.  This piece would clearly be in D major. But sometimes there can be more than one correct answer to the question \"what key is it in?\".  If the tune is in a minor key, the key signature may have two flats (it's in \"the key of B-flat\") while the tonic chord is G minor, and the scale is a G harmonic or melodic minor.  Most musicians would say the tune is \"in G minor\", and some will specify \"G harmonic minor\". Blues tunes can have two correct answers.  A blues in E may have a key signature or E major (four sharps) to agree with the chord structure (E major as the tonic chord), but for some pieces a publisher might chose the key signature of G because it will minimize the number of accidentals needed for the melody line.  So you might see a key signature of G major, a tonic chord of E major, and an E blues scale used.  Most musicians would say it's a \"blues in E\", communicating both the chord progression and the scale. Modal music will always have a key signature that differs from the tonic chord and scale.  The first section of Miles Davis' tune \"So What\" has a key signature of C, an extended Dm as the tonic chord, and a D Dorian scale.  You can't say that \"C major\" or \"D minor\" is the wrong key - it's just that those statements aren't as helpful to the musician as saying it's \"in D Dorian\". And there are some pieces of music that are in two keys at once, a concept called bitonality.  In Charles Ives' Piano Sonata No. 2  the third movement has the pianist's right hand in Bb and the left hand in Ab. The best answer to \"what key is this in?\" will be whatever answer gives the musicians the most information to work with. ",

            "answer_text": "It's sort of a tricky question. The key, or key center, is the tonal home of the song. There is a chord that embodies this tonal home, and when you play it, the music feels resolved and \"at home\". If that chord is C (major), then the key is C major. If that chord is Em (minor) then the key is E minor. This chord is called the tonic. What is tricky is this is not always the first chord of a song, or the last chord of the song. And some songs change keys. And sometimes the song is non-diatonic (not \"of the scale\"; i.e. it's not following the most conventional rules of harmony), such that the key center does not define a large number of the chords in the song. Many songs are mostly diatonic, with an exception or two that usually are the interesting and unique parts of the song. Trust your ear. A great teacher once told me there is no wrong way to play something beautiful. Dispense with fear and be adventurous. It's only music, chances are no one is going to die, much less even get hurt. Someone else will drop by with a better answer hopefully. But if you find a chord that feels like \"home\", chances are that chord is showing you the key of the song. ",
