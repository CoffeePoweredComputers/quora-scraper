            "answer_text": "Music I direct you, and anyone else interested in learning, to the book How We Learn, by Benedict Carey, which has some truly amazing information on research in these areas. Below is from the section discussing music and other distractions. Note that while those who studied and tested to the same music did best, those who studied to music and tested in silence did better than those who studied in silence and tested in silence. Please note I totally support what others have said here, that work music should not have lyrics that one would pay attention to. Though here it did not seem to matter. I cannot recommend this book enough. It\u2019s an easy read, that blows away a lot of our intuitional thinking about effective studying and offers some easily applicable techniques to maximize data retention. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- One group studied in silence. Another had a jazz number, Milt Jackson\u2019s \u201cPeople Make the World Go Around,\u201d playing in the background. The third had Mozart\u2019s Piano Concerto Number 24 in C Minor. The music was on when the subjects arrived in their assigned rooms, and they had no reason to believe it was relevant to the experiment. They spent ten minutes memorizing, and left. The students returned to the study room two days later and, without warning, they were given a test to see how many words they could freely recall. This time, Smith changed the tune for many of them. He subdivided the three groups. Some who\u2019d studied to jazz took the test with jazz again; others took it with the Mozart; and others in silence. Likewise for those who studied with Mozart or in silence: They tested either in the same condition, or one of the other two. Nothing else changed. Nothing, that is, except their scores. Smith found that those who studied with Milt Jackson playing and took the test with the same music recalled twenty-one words on average\u2014twice as many as those who studied with Jackson and took the test to Mozart, or in silence. Similarly, those who studied with Mozart recalled nearly twice as many words with Mozart playing than in silence or with the jazz in the background. The punch line: Of those who studied and tested in the same condition, the silence-silence group did the worst. They recalled, on average, about half the words that the jazz-jazz or classical-classical groups did (eleven versus twenty). This is bizarre, and it raised an unexpected question: Could quiet somehow be inhibiting memory? The answer was no. If it had, then those who\u2019d studied with jazz would have done worse taking the test in silence than with Mozart (vice versa, for those who\u2019d studied with classical). They hadn\u2019t.

            "answer_text": "This is a tricky, TRICKY topic. I am researching it myself. For years I would go into auto-pilot mode with my music on and sure I enjoy it....but I realize I could never really get into the zone to do serious studying at home or work on my website. I believe the reason is because when I put on music, I start feeling like it's happy hour and I never get into the \"zone\" to study. It's like for me to practice something, I must first warm my brain up (the same way you warm your body up before you exercise). If I don't get that far, it's a done deal. So I'm forcing myself to go without music and I feel I have more control over my ability to focus. I would listen previously to classical or Jabig's mixes on youtube, I feel like if I am programming I can do it. Like if it's a routine thing and I \"kind\" of get what I'm doing. But I feel if you are reading or trying to absorb and master complex material (like math or physics), it interferes with me even getting started on it.  So I'd say there are several key distinctions.  1) The Task: Is it routine (folding clothes, another day at the office) or is there reading or problem solving involved (math, physics, history)? That being said, I would listen to battle music on youtube when doing programs or calculus and I felt pretty good at times. If I get into that zone and it's on (no lyrics by the way), I can hammer through it pretty well. Music can enhance mood and concentration and at the same time, break one's ability to focus and absorb complex subject matter. I would say during breaks, music can benefit everyone as it has soothing effects (the right kind) but not everyone can study to it. One website suggested listening to music that motivates you before you study, then shut it off. I don't like complete silence, but I can't stand erratic noises or words either. My computer makes a little noise, so it is never dead silent.  The type of music I would only listen to when I study are classical, jazz, ambient/instrumental music or the sound of rain and thunder (nature sounds). These are good genres, but I still don't quite understand my brain all the way yet. Aside from genre, there can be powerful psychological associations to music in itself. If you feel music is in some way tied to relaxing, tread carefully. You don't want to relax too much when you study, you want to be focused and alert. This goes along with your study environment, some people have to go out of the house to get anything done (like one of my friends told me he lives at school). I like to study in my room, but for it to be successful I need to figure out exactly how my thinking processes are impacted when exposed to different sounds. I feel I can better isolate my room for studying if I keep the tunes low or off. Anything above that will inhibit my ability to focus and retain information. There are many variations to this study, you have to use trial and error to find what works (and what doesn't). What everyone should focus on is their \"ideal\" study habitat. ",
