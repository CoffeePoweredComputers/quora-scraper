            "answer_text": "The key to understanding is the anchor pin at the top of the assembly. This is what both shoes rest on prior to brake application. When the brakes are applied the pistons in the slave cylinder push both shoes away from the anchor pin, but the trailing (slave) shoe is immediately dragged back into contact with the anchor pin as soon as the shoes contact the drum. Now the leading (master) shoe is carried away from the anchor pin, and pushes on the slave shoe via the adjuster link\u2026so the slave shoe is not pushed with just the slave cylinder force, but with all of the braking force on the master shoe. The slave shoe thus sees 150\u2013200% as much pressure as the master shoe. In order to prevent premature wear, the slave shoe has proportionally greater lining area as compared to the master shoe. Edit: In response to Alan Murrie\u2019s comment I am adding this photo of a Bendix patent type self-energizing drum brake mechanism as used on most (maybe all?) American cars and trucks that used drum brakes. This is the type of brake upon which this answer is based. This example lacks the self-adjuster and parking brake mechanisms that would add complication.  ",

            "answer_text": "A simple drum brake system uses a trailing (secondary) and a leading (primary) brake shoe operated by a single slave cylinder. Usually only on the back wheels of cars, or front wheels of tandem trailers now. The leading brake shoe tends to wedge and becomes self-servo braking without the need for power assist. The trailing shoe is there to basically only become a leading shoe while reversing, with this self-servo effect. Same applies to trailer electric brakes.  Considerable extra braking comes from having each shoe as a leading shoe with their own slave cylinder. (For clockwise drum rotation in the picture).They become useless in reverse, and thus need power assist to work in reverse with friction from just slave cylinder pressure because there is no wedging, self-servo effect in reverse (anti-clockwise drum rotation).   You can see that there are many brake shoe configurations and I was specifically referring to the Simplex and Duplex type of drum brake. The Bendix type that is used in American cars is mostly the duo-servo type. ",
