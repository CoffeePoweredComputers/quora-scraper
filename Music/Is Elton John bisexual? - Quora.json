            "answer_text": "I would say that Elton John is a bisexual man who experiences stronger attraction to men than he does to women. Conversely, his friend David Bowie was a bisexual man who experienced stronger attraction to women than he did to men. The fact that Elton now identifies as a Gay man after initially coming out as bisexual is a reflection of the issues society has with accepting and understanding bisexuality in general and male bisexuality in particular.
