            "answer_text": "I love Christian worship music in general, but sometimes get tired of it for several reasons: The lack of doctrine or content for the sake of a catchy tune. The old hymns contained so much bible truth and good doctrine. Consider these lyrics: \u201c His oath, His covenant and blood, support me in the overwhelming flood. I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly lean on Jesus\u2019 name. On Christ the solid rock I stand, all other ground is sinking sand.\u201d It\u2019s gold! Some of the contemporary hymns, however, address this well, for instance, the wonderful \u201cIn Christ Alone\u201d.Lyrics which elevate feelings above faith (more on this in point 4).Either questionable (or very sketchy) doctrine or content. E.g. there\u2019s a song which talks about God \u201ccovering\u201d our sin, instead of it being washed away. In fact, Hebrews 10: 10\u201312 says, from verse 10Our sins are washed away and we are made clean because Christ gave His own body as a gift to God. He did this once for all time. 11 All Jewish religious leaders stand every day killing animals and giving gifts on the altar. They give the same gifts over and over again. These gifts cannot take away sins. 12 But Christ gave Himself once for sins and that is good forever. After that He sat down at the right side of God There\u2019s a big difference between the Old Covenant, when sins were \u201ccovered\u201d so had to be atoned for every year, and Jesus washing away our sins in the New. It\u2019s one of the many reasons why the New Covenant is vastly superior to the Old. Too many \u201cI\u201ds and \u201cme\u201ds! Too much naval gazing and introspection when our focus should ultimately be directed to God. When you read Psalms, a lot of the content is about the writer\u2019s emotions and experiences, but it\u2019s balanced by faith in God and the revelations of His character. I wish more contemporary writers kept that balance. It\u2019s so important.In church, many songs are in the \u201citem\u201d category, yet everyone is still encouraged to sing them, when they are not suitable for general congregational singing. These songs should stay as items. I have seen people struggling to engage in song services because of a more sophisticated melody line, or an uncomfortable key. We need to be considerate and try to engage our people fully with \u201cuser-friendly\u201d songs. ( Also, some hymns were designed as choir pieces, not for untrained singers and the same applies to them.)",

            "answer_text": "An affirming Yes!, I like Christian Music, or more specifically CCM, and/or Praise Music. I play this music with three different groups. to different arrays of listeners, and I see the positive effect it has on folk, enhancing their experience of the worship of the moment. The lyrics can be uplifting and certainly prayerful. The music though simple, rains a soothing, unifying peace upon the people. With this music I can worship, thank, petition our God. I can also express my own shortcomings, needs, failures, and hopes. but a few misgivings\u2026 On the other hand, I am also a traditional (Catholic) church musician, and feel there must always be a respect for the sacred liturgy of the mass (Musica Sacram). Sometimes I see music being played in inappropriate places of the mass, or with themes that have nothing to do with the liturgy of the day; almost a declaration of \u2018well I like this song, and its about God, so I\u2019m playing it\u2019. A lot of CCM music is an examination one\u2019s personal feelings and needs, and are more a self-based expression, not necessarily appropriate for celebration of the Mass. (On the other hand, I also see diligent leaders of song tirelessly examining which music would most help the congregation in their worship of the day.) I had to chuckle when I realized that with four chords (C-G-Am-F) and a capo, I could probably play 80% of CCM I\u2019ve heard (OK, throw in an Em or Dm7 for giggles). Again, it is the skill of player which determines whether the song is just a mindless repetition of music, or a seriously choreographed uplifting of the souls of the participants in joyful worship. I personally avoid being in an arena full of people watching a CCM \u2018super star\u2019 play a loud, massive wall of sound of Praise music like a rock concert. (Just personal taste; I\u2019d rather play a single guitar with two singers in small church, personally touching the small crowd of people who are there to worship.) But I have to admit, the experience of seeing 12,000 people swaying, hands in air, singing \u2018Holy, holy, holy\u2019 does tell me something very special is happening there. ",
