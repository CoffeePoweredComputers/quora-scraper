            "answer_text": "OHHHH! I ADORE band camp!!! Okay, I\u2019ve totally got this one. First, ALWAYS do something to know names. You can go around in a circle and say names and something you like or something about you. If you break into small groups, or sections, you could play two truths and a lie, which is nice. *Do not try that one with full ensemble It won\u2019t work* After knowing everyone\u2019s names, you can play a tag game or a game of charades *also a hard one with full ensemble*. If your leadership is up for something a little louder, the game in which people play rock paper scissors is fun. Each time you win, that person follows you around cheering your name behind you. If you lose, then you and all your followers cheer another person on. It\u2019s a cool way to get some laughs and cement the names. All in all, band camp is supposed to be welcoming and fun. If you have that vibe- the rest will follow. You\u2019re gonna get a bunch of good good kids to deal with here, regardless of whether or not you\u2019re the teacher or a leadership kid. (drum major, woodwind/brass captain) Just have fun with it. The rest will follow. Hope this helped!!! ~Music Paige (Clarinet) ",
