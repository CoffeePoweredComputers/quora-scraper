            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll answer this based on my favorite group and my knowing about international fandom (or at least in Indonesia): Wanna One. We all know how big they are in Korea and internationally, literally living the title nation\u2019s boy group. Made from survival show, Produce 101 season 2, they have gained big fan base since debuting. But there are still some member that do receive little attention than what they deserves (again, this is 100% my opinion and I might get biased but this is based from what I know). Yoon Jisung \u2014 ranked 8th out of 11 line-up debut. He is a talented vocalist. He has worked so hard to be able to debut in first place. He spent his youth training. He spent his days in small basement, yet he did not give up. He has strong mentality. Yet some people bash him for debuting, for being too old as idol group member, for how sentimental he is. Some people even bash him for littlest mistake in dancing, when the whole group are definitely tired from performing daily and tight schedules. Some people don\u2019t even like him because he\u2019s ugly (and excuse me, he is NOT UGLY AT ALL). I know that there are a lot of Babals (Jisung\u2019s fandom name) in Korea, he has sold out fanmeeting and doing fine with his solo, but he\u2019s still underrated internationally. I hope people would wake up and not wasting time hating on him. He\u2019s just too precious.Lai Kuanlin \u2014 coming from Taipei, he only spoke little Korean when in survival show Produce 101. He is shy, and cannot speak freely. He struggled because he has only trained for 6 months before, yet he managed to debut. I don\u2019t see many hate towards him, but I know that some people are mocking him for various reasons, such as his lack of speaking skill, his lack of rapping skill (excuse me, he trained for 6 months for rap, dance and still need to learn Korean), and his lack of dancing.Lee Daehwi \u2014 my favorite, talented guy. He\u2019s 01 liner, yet he might be the most talented member of all. My favorite is his composing skill. He has composed for their class evaluation in Produce 1o1 (with Hollywood), produced for Produce48 (See You Again), produced for Yoon Jisung debut solo album (Slow), Park Jihoon (Young 20), IZ*One (Airplane). He could dance, and his vocal is great. He\u2019s a born idol. Yet some people bash him for his interaction with Wanna One members. Some akgaes from other members are hating on him for nothing. He has to tip toed ever since. It\u2019s sad. Not many people acknowledge his talent.It\u2019s all I got for now. Again, this is based only from what I\u2019ve seen online and I might be biased. ",
