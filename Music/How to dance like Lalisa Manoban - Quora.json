            "answer_text": "I think you should take dance classes, and if that\u2019s not affordable or if you have any other issues, you can just learn easy K-pop choreographies at home! Just go on youtube to find some dance covers/tutorials and try to memorize the choreographies. The key to become a good dancer is to work and train hard. Training hard to dance doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s mandatory to attend dance classes or to join a dance studio, just train hard at home .Lalisa Manoban has been a dancer for a long time means she practised and trained a lot. Even before coming to South Korea, she was part of a dance crew in Thailand. So, in conclusion, just practise a lot and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to dance like her some day. Anyway, Love ya, Baii~ ",
