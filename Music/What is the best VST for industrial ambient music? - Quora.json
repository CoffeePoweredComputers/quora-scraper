            "answer_text": "I would say you need a sample player. Uvi Workstation is free and highly configurable with built-in lowpass resonant filters.  An analog synth or model like the minimoog or Arp2600 from Arturia are both very good and should be excellent for anything from thundering bass lines to filtered drones to screaming leads.  Izotopes Iris can produce truly unique sounds from ambient environments.  Dexed is a free download and can do everything that the DX7 or FM 7 can do.  A decent DAW to sequence all of this stuff together, a good mic and a guitar to add some humanity and to record it all in.   You might also check for some glitch siftware like Stutteredit or breaktweaker, although I have no first-hand experience with these particular tools.  I would finally recommend something like a zoom recorder or a laptop with an audio interface to capture found-sounds to create unique atmosphere or rythmic tracks.  ",

            "answer_text": "As far as free synths go check out Tyrel N6, TrippleCheese, Free Alpha and Zebralete. Then download the BlueCat free plugin pack and the Meffects Free Bundle. Blue Cat will give many modulation options and a decent reverb unit (I have found reverbs to be the hardest plugins to find for free). Meffeccts bundle has as REALY good bandpass filter with is useful in creating low pass filter effects. Also the synth+filter+BlueCat Phaser+BlueCat reverb is a chain I use to make ambient synth lines. As far as creating crunchy industrial drums, download Camel Crusher (a distortion/filter/compressor that makes drums POP). ",
