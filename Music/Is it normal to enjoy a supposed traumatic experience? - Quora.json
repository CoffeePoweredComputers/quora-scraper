            "answer_text": "Well\u2026. No\u2026 I guess it depends on the specific traumatic experience though. Assuming that it\u2019s \u201csupposed\u201d by the majority to be a traumatic experience, and that majority also avoids situations like that due to feeling it as unpleasant, then it\u2019s not normal if you enjoy it. Normal is considered something that the majority engages in, or in this case what the majority finds traumatic; this doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s healthy or good, just that it\u2019s normal. Being a philosopher, I really want to dive into what normal really is, because in my opinion \u201cmost\u201d people engage in certain things that I find repulsive and harmful, but I will leave it at that.
