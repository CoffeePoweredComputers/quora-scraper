            "answer_text": "This is directly from- Johnbonham.co.uk: In September 1980 all four members of Led Zeppelin had begun rehearsing in preparation for their first tour of North America since 1977, which was planned to kick off on October 17th in Montreal, Canada. The rehearsals took place near Jimmy Page\u2019s Windsor home where the band was staying. It was here where John Paul Jones and Benje LeFevre (Led Zeppelin\u2019s road manager) discovered Bonham\u2019s body, in the morning of September 25th. Bonham had died tragically from inhalation of vomit in bed during his sleep, aged just 32. In the day leading up to his premature death, Bonham had been on a 12-hour binge drinking session, which began at noon and lasted until midnight, when he fell unconscious. He had consumed an alarming 40 units of vodka. The UK\u2019s recommended maximum intake of alcoholic beverages per day for men is 3-4 units. After falling unconscious on a sofa, he was put to bed by an assistant where he could sleep off his drunkenness. The assistant laid him on his side with pillows for support. John Paul Jones: \u201cBenje and I found him. It was like, \u201cLet\u2019s go up and look at Bonzo, see how he is.\u201d We tried to wake him up\u2026 It was terrible. Then I had to tell the other two\u2026 I had to break the news to Jimmy and Robert. It made me feel very angry \u2013 at the waste of him\u2026 I can\u2019t say he was in good shape, because he wasn\u2019t. There were some good moments during the last rehearsals \u2026 but then he started on the vodka.\u201d \u201cI think he had been drinking because there were some problems in his personal life. But he died because of an accident. He was lying down the wrong way, which could have happened to anybody who drank a lot.\u201d An ambulance was called in the morning immediately after Bonham was discovered, but it was too late for them to do anything. The police also arrived at Jimmy\u2019s house, but no suspicious circumstances were identified. An inquest into John Bonham\u2019s death was held at East Berkshire coroner\u2019s court on October 18th where it was determined that Bonham had died from inhalation of his own vomit during sleep which led to pulmonary edema. (Pulmonary edema describes fluid accumulation in the lungs, which can cause respiratory failure.) The cause of death was put down as \u201cconsumption of alcohol\u201d. A verdict of accidental death was arrived at and recorded. Robert Plant describes John\u2019s frame of mind as they drove to their last rehearsal together: \u201cOn the very last day of his life, as we drove to the rehearsal, he was not quite as happy as he could be. He said, \u201cI\u2019ve had it with playing drums. Everybody plays better than me.\u201d We were driving in the car and he pulled off the sun visor and threw it out the window as he was talking. He said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, when we get to the rehearsal, you play the drums and I\u2019ll sing.\u201d And that was our last rehearsal.\u201d John Bonham\u2019s family funeral service took place on October 10th 1980 at Rushock Parish Church in Worcestershire. Around 250 mourners attended, made up of family, friends, band mates and other musicians including: Roy Wood, Denny Laine, Bev Bevan and Jeff Lynne. Paul McCartney left a wreath and tributes flooded in from fellow drummers including Carmine Appice, Phil Collins, Cozy Powell and Carl Palmer. After the family service, the funeral procession made its way to Worcester Crematorium where the final service was held. Swan Song Records (Led Zeppelins record label started by their manager Peter Grant) issued a statement on December 4th 1980, which addressed the many rumors regarding the bands uncertain future following the death of Led Zeppelin\u2019s drummer John Bonham: \u201cWe wish it to be known that the loss of our dear friend and the deep sense of undivided harmony felt by ourselves and our manager, have led us to decide that we could not continue as we were.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "You mean AFTER THEY KILLED HIM? Bonham was one of the earliest guys to try to leave the illuminati music machine and actually played for several really good bands as well as recording for himself. However the illuminati never accepted that Led Zeppelin was DOA and so they sought revenge and got that. They usually do. It is always tragic and guys like him are martyrs to a higher cause. Just know that part of the story because the rest is all \u201cofficial\u201d version where THEY will tell you anything/everything but truth in the matter. ",
