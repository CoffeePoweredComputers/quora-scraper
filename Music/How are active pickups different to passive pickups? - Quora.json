            "answer_text": "These are good answers. As others have noted, the basic difference is that the active pickups have some kind of small pre-amp either in the pickup housing, or in the guitar. The pickups themselves, and the signal they send, can have much lower impedance. This is because active pickups do not need to produce a high amplitude (loud or hot) signal; the on-board pre-amp can give you all the gain you need. Pickups are usually made by wrapping a single wire many times around a magnet. Passive pickups achieve higher amplitude signals by either increasing the number of windings on the pickup, or having stronger magnets. Either of these comes with some trade-offs. More windings on a pickup increases the impedance, lowers the resonant frequency, and starts to rob the pickup of high end. This is due to inductance working within the coils, where the signal traveling through the pickup wire wraps produce a magnetic field around the wire which then creates a current working in opposition to the signal. If, for example, you compare lower output single coil pickups to those with higher winding counts, you\u2019ll find that in general they have a broader frequency response with more highs. Single coils with more windings tend to roll off the highs, and have more pronounced midrange. If you like the sound of David Gilmour ripping it up on his black Strat\u2019s bridge pickup, this is the sound of a very overwound single coil pickup. So you can see that while I referred to these characteristics as a trade-off, many people actually love what these \u2018compromises\u2019 do the sound. Increasing the strength of a pickup\u2019s magnets can also increase the amplitude of the signal a pickup sends, but this will also have consequences. Pickup magnets actually pull on the guitar strings, and this force works to slow down the vibrating strings. Stronger magnets do this more, and have a bigger effect on reducing how long a string vibrates, reducing sustain. In extreme case, magnetic pull from guitar pickups can even pull notes out of tune. If you\u2019ve ever tried setting the intonation on a Stratocaster where all three pickups are adjusted too close to the strings, you may have encountered this. An advantage of active pickups can use less powerful magnets, and a result they should exert less force on the stings, and allow for greater sustain. Others have noted that active pickups have more versatile tone shaping capabilities, and this is true. Passive pickups have tone controls, but these are only subtractive. When using passive tone controls, you turn you tone knob and a rather broad range of frequencies centered at a specific resonant frequency get shunted out of the signal path. The pre-amp in an active set-up can be designed to both cut and boost specific frequencies. This capacity to add more amplitude in specific frequency ranges is a huge difference. Any kind of equalization circuit can be added to an active pickup system. Narrow notches can be cut or boosted, and overall volume can be restored after specific frequencies are cut, something passive pickup systems cannot offer. Another advantage of active pickup systems is that the pre-amp can be designed to send a low impedance signal down your guitar cable. This is great thing, because it reduces the tendency of your cable to rob highs from the signal through the innate capacitance of the cable, and for the signal path to pick up cable noise. This becomes especially noticeable with long cable runs. If you\u2019ve ever used a buffer pedal at the beginning of a pedal board signal chain, or before a long cable run, an active pickup set up can do the same thing, but minus that first few feet of cable. Most people do not realize that even relatively short cables can have large amounts of capacitance, and can color the sound of your guitar. Sending a low impedance signal is a great way to counter this. Doing so will allow the guitar to sound much more consistent when using different brands and different lengths of cable. The downsides are that you need to power the pre-amp in the guitar, either with batteries or by sending power using an external phantom power supply. Poorly designed active circuits can be noisy. Noise often depends on how the controls are set. For example, boosting the highs in some circuits will add quite a bit of noise. You might wonder why more guitars do not come equipped with active pickups. Aside from the added expense and complexity of active systems, passive humbucking pickup systems are enormously popular. In part this is because they roll off the high end, and have pronounced midrange. Some people also like the sound of passive pickups loaded down by a long cable. The original Paul Reed Smith \u201csweet switch\u201d was designed to roll off the high end in much the same way that a very long guitar cable would. And as I mentioned earlier, many people love the way old style passive pickups sound. While the advantages I\u2019ve described are real, they are not always desirable. ",

            "answer_text": "Active pickups have a preamp somewhere, either in the pickup itself (EMGs) or in the control cavity (guitars or basses with active electronics.) There's a little battery powered amplifier in the guitar. That can give you more tonal flexibility, more gain coming into the amp, or more volume control from the guitar if the amp isn't overdriven yet. The signal to noise ratio is usually higher since there's a higher amplitude signal coming through the cable. Also, the pickups can be wound with lower impedance, meaning fewer turns of copper and a lower output from the electromagnetic pickups, relying on the preamp to boost the signal. Lower impedance pickups can contain more high highs than high impedance pickups. Maybe lower lows as well. So active electronics potentially open the door to a wider frequency range. Sometimes that's achieved, sometimes it isn't, and even if there is a wider frequency response some people don't want that. Some people prefer passive electronics because they don't want the preamp in the signal path they just want the electromagnetic pickups and their actual amp (and maybe effects) to be heard. Tube purists may realize that active electronics are always solid state. They sound crappy when they clip (overdrive), but are usually set up not to do so. Passive pickups have a more focused frequency response, which can sometimes work the best with a nuanced overdriven sound. They also have a different dynamic range (soft to loud.) Safe to say most guitarists really like their passive pickups. Examples are humbuckers on a les paul, single coils on a Stratocaster. Dimarzios for the 80s, these days bare knuckles. The exceptions where guitarists want active pickups are EMGs for metal: bone crushing Metallica and such. Also, the Dead all played their Alembic guitars, which are the original active guitars. Speaking of Alembic, most people who like active electronics are bassists. John entwistle, Phil Lesh, Stanley Clark all play (ed) active alembic basses. Victor Wooten plays active (Fodera), Steve Bailey, Flea\u2026 most bassists with a modern tone and a wide band of frequency. Bassists need to fit somewhere in the frequency mix without overlapping the other instruments too badly, so it helps to have more potent control over tone right at the bass. That said, many or even most basses are passive: fender precision and jazz basses, rickenbacker, most players go with passive basses for a more traditional sound. John Paul Jones, Chris Squire, James Jamerson\u2026 Gotta have passive for those sounds. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d argue that \u201cactive pickups\u201d is actually a misnomer. What we\u2019re discussing are pickups with a preamp. Some pickups, like many EMGs are designed with this in mind and have the low wind/weak magnet construction that are mentioned below. Other guitar systems with active electronics use normal pickups, like those in the BCRich guitars historically, which were original Guild pickups, then changed to DiMarzio but standard pickups. The next aspect of this is a bit complicated. Think about a wah pedal, when you roll it forward there\u2019s a lot of high end, roll it back and it becomes bassier. That\u2019s a resonant low pass filter working. The combination of pickup winding, tone capacitor and input impedance of the preamp (or pedal or guitar amp) creates a low pass filter. The less capacitance the higher the peak frequency and the narrower the resonant peak will be. Weaker magnets and smaller windings will also do this. So, starting with a pickup wound for an active system gives you a particular sound-usually pretty bright and loud, then you can cut that down with a tone control which can be as simple as treble cut, or some kind of active boost/cut like a Baxandall EQ. This can be manipulated by the character of the pickup, preamp gain and EQ-so you can get anything from the Seymour Duncan Nazgul over the top gain and massive bass, to the super clean and clinical output from an Alembic. Or the really complicated result of printing the coils with the newer Fishman Fluence pickups\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Well, first of all, actives require batteries. On an electric guitar actives have a very compressed tone, it\u2019s a bit hard to explain but the tone is very \u201ccold\u201d, like it\u2019s lacking something, especially on the clean channel (I've seen some people saying that newer models like the EMGX have somewhat fixed this). This is one of the biggest reasons some people dislike them, and it's totally understandable. They totally shine when they have gain though, so metal players use them a lot. The tone is focused and has a lot of sustain, leads also sound good since the tone is balanced. All in all I feel like good passives can outperform actives, and so I regret buying my guitar with actives, that doesn't mean they suck though. ",
