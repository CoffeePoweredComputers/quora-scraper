In fact, Chester\u2019s depression was the reason why his songs had an edge of pain in them.  Chester speaking out on Depression Due to his own personal experiences, Chester was a strong advocate of supporting mental health and had collaborated with many organizations to promote this. He ALWAYS made it a point to bring up those experiences which haunted him to let people know they weren\u2019t alone. Those who have known and followed Chester would not have been surprised, although still saddened, by his demise, after the death of his close friend and confidant, Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell. His death serves us all a reminder of the perils and impacts of depression as well as any mental illness, which is to ensure that no one ever faces those experiences which he had.

            "answer_text": "Chester Bennington indirectly said that he had depression. At least you can guess from his words that he did not feel happy and fulfilled being alone with his inner self when you read about his last interviews about depression and watch related videos. If you watch the full video of Chester's 2017 interview attentively, you will notice that saying that in part when he says: \"Nothing makes me happy. I do not like anyone. I even told my therapists at one point: \"I do not want to feel anything.\" For me, life got really weird and really hard all at one time,\" and the therapist asks if he does not want to be human, he says that he answered: \"Yes!\" Chester looks to the interviewer with a long pause, with a serious face expression, and laughs as soon as Mike laughs, making it look light. In the last interview, you can also get informed better seeing what and how he says.  ",
