            "answer_text": "Moreover, a lot of people who can sing, think they cannot sing at all. This is a self-awareness think, I guess, because when person sings his favorite song, he enjoys it, but here comes the substitution of layers: this person enjoying themselves singing a song they like, actually enjoy a song, and singing it out loud is a physical response added to the emotions that it brings up in a person. Somehow, many people who just sing something all the time, can be put back on Earth in a second in a Karaoke bar. Singing is following the rhythm, key, voice modulations, quick switches between high pitched notes to low pitched notes \u2014 those are not even the basics, this is kind of built-in awareness, that people whose musicality exists, for starters, and is quite high, so that they can assess their own singing and know how they sound on the record, for example. Almost every person like 20 years ago, who installed Photoshop into their computers, automatically proclaimed themselves the designers. ",

            "answer_text": "Anyone, who likes to sing, doesn\u2019t know that they can or can\u2019t especially in childhood.You enjoy singing, period.With time & experience,everyone gets told regardless of what type of singing one enjoys that they can or can\u2019t. No one is born a finished singer in any category.-I heard a recording of Mario Lanza at 18. His input was not the M.L. that we know as a finished singer.- Singers can not hear themselves in a subjective constructive sense.You need another pair of ears outside of you. A singer never truly hears objectively, always being aurally an apprentice. Singing also takes so long to master, because the hourly system is financially good for teachers but ruinous for the singer. ",
