            "answer_text": "Hi, I\u2019d advise you to firstly decide on which company do you want to audition for. Each company has its website, where the information about the audition is. Make sure to check their websites. Some big companies often do global or monthly/weekly auditions in some big cities. These are called offline auditions because the judges get to meet you face to face. However, if you\u2019re not from any of the areas where the company holds offline auditions, don\u2019t worry. You can send your application online (on their website OR via email - it depends on the company). Good luck! ",
