            "answer_text": "From my knowledge, I don\u2019t think Freddie wrote any material in his final hours. In fact, I think most of the new songs on the Made in Heaven album were either composed by Brian, Roger, and John. Of course, Freddie wrote Made in Heaven, I Was Born to Love You, and Let Me Live. However, these tracks were written and recorded during the Mr. Bad Guy era. I think Freddie was too ill at this point to try to compose a song. He continued to sing on tracks, but to compose a song takes a lot of focus, dedication, and concentration. Although Freddie was able to summon enough strength to sing, I think actually writing music was too challenging for him considering how ill he was. I\u2019m not sure if it was Peter Freestone or Jim Hutton, but once someone mentioned how Freddie didn\u2019t like starting a project if he knew there was a possibility it would not come to fruition or completion. I think this, in addition to the illness, prevented him from writing material in his latter days. Of course, Freddie was technically dying during the creation of Innuendo and also the Barcelona album. Freddie composed the following on the Innuendo album: -Innuendo -I\u2019m Going Slightly Mad -Don\u2019t Try So Hard -All God\u2019s People -Delilah I think he also helped quite a bit with The Show Must Go On and also Bijou. With Barcelona, Freddie basically composed all the songs, and Mike Moran helped him arrange the pieces for an orchestra. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are the facts from someone who has 30 biographies of Queen, Freddie Mercury and Brian May. Fred\u2019s final song with the knowledge of his death looming is \u2018A Winter\u2019s Tale\u2019. The band finished the song without him. Thankfully Freddie left some vocal tracks for them to put the music to. Freddie is a role model. He was the first South Asian and Indian, globally known songwriter. He believed in his destiny and overcame family pressure to be someone who he is not. We can find fault with anyone and that\u2019s why humans have the concept of evolutionary growth within their lifespan. To say he is not a role model is like saying Christopher Columbus was and never acknowledging the work that his his alone. I disagree with the previous post before me. ",
