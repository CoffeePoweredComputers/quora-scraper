            "answer_text": "I took about 1,000 years for Christianity to finally come to the Scandinavian countries, so it was a very long, hard-fought battle. Christianity had to make certain concessions. Consider the days of the week, such as \u201cThor\u2019s Day\u201d (Thursday) etc. Consider that Christianity had to become tolerant of northern myths such as Elves and Dwarves, without considering it all to be of Satan\u2019s work. But once Christianity got a foothold in the fight for the Scandinavian soul, it gradually became more and more dominant. What I personally think destined Christianity to remain dominant and the worship of Thor and Odin to fade into the background is this: modern science is much more consistent with monotheism than polytheism. We no longer accept theories such as lightning exists because Thor throws his hammer. That would never work today. But monotheism, especially in a more Deistic form, appealed greatly to Enlightenment and even modern scientists such as Newton, Einstein, and Christian Huygens (who was Scandinavian). Because they all thought thusly: one universe, one set of universal laws uniting all the universe together; therefore a Universal Lawgiver. ",

            "answer_text": "They say that the Fimbul winter was a sure sign of Ragnarok, and it took place 536\u2013540 CE, when volcanic eruptions made farming collapse and brought famine and plague. There was anger against the gods and a stronger Odin war cult was installed by the time of Beowulf. When Norse farming was finally restored, Christian missionairies beheaded Saxons who did not convert, and this sparked the Viking age of conquest around 800 CE. Iceland was settled by Norse together with Irish and Scots, and then a one year long volcanic eruption there in 940 made many convert to Christianity. Over the 900s, Denmark, Norway and Sweden became kingdoms with christian kings. And then churches replaced the old cult places. ",
