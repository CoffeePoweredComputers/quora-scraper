            "answer_text": "From a classical guitarist perspective, what I look for would probably relate to any type of acoustic guitar. The first thing I look at is the wood. It should be a solid wood top, not a laminate wood. There is an easy way to determine this.  Above is an example of a laminate top, the grains of the wood disappear at the edge of the soundhole. It is just sandwiched paper basically.  As you can see, this real spruce top has the grains of the wood also visible where the hole is cut. This is a solid wood top. I would not consider a laminate wood top on any guitar, it is cheap and will sound terrible. Next we look inside. Laminate wood for the back and sides is not so much of a sonic issue, but good guitars will have solid wood back and sides. This is what a good one looks like.  In the image above, you can clearly see the wood grain on this handmade solid wood guitar. This is rosewood but all woods will have a grain to see. Laminate will not have any grain lines inside. Laminate may have grain lines on the outside, but they are just painted on for show, inside you will see the real deal. There will be a label clearly on view inside a decent guitar. It would do you favours to look up the model and maker before purchase just to have an idea of the value. I then look at the body and neck finish to see if all the lines are well matched. Everything should be smooth and without errors. The tuning heads should be smooth and fairly tight. If they are loose or rough, then unless it\u2019s a really good buy and you\u2019re willing to put a hundred into it for new tuning pegs, then walk away. Have a look at the neck.  If you look at it from this angle, it should be dead straight. It is generally OK if there is a *VERY* slight dip from the nut to the end of the board, but avoid it if you see it is not almost totally flat. Certainly if one side is flat and the other side has any curvature, put it back on the shelf! This may not apply to steel-string acoustic guitars with a truss rod, as neck bends can be altered, but a good quality guitar should be really straight. Last but not least, playability. Don\u2019t annoy anyone with Stairway To Heaven! Everyone has their method. Mine is to play chromatic scales from the bottom to the top. You will notice any dead frets this way. Then check the harmonics and intonation. I may play part of a piece which requires some notes high on the neck and some bar chords but that's about it. I look forward to hearing some tips from our electric guitar brothers and sisters out there! ",

            "answer_text": "For acoustics look to make sure that the bridge is not lifting or any neck joint body separation. Make sure there are no splits or cracks in the body. Make sure there are no sharp fret ends or loose machine heads and look for a solid top. Play the instrument and make sure it is comfortable in your hands and has a tone you are looking for. Make sure there are no dead frets or rattling from loose braces. For electrics look for a guitar that feels solid and has a good acoustic resonance, even though it\u2019s meant to be plugged in a dead piece of wood won\u2019t sound as good as a lively one. Make sure all the knobs and switches are tight and functional and that the pickups have a good sound without too much noise. Play the instrument and make sure that it feels good in your hands and has no dead frets of sharp fret edges. Both acoustic and electric make sure have good action and intonation the whole way up the neck. ",

The neck is the main \u2018interface\u2019 between your hands and the guitar, so if the neck is not right for you, you probably won\u2019t be happy with the guitar in the long run. The neck should be straight (i.e, not warped) and feel comfortable in your hand (i.e., comfortable width, thickness, and finish). Run your hands along the side of the neck; the frets should not stick out or feel sharp. Finally, play every single note on the guitar and listen for correct intonation and notes that ring out without buzzing or rattling. ",
