            "answer_text": "Have you tried an MRI? Just kidding. This is one of the perennial problems for new composers. Before you find the notes to the melody in your head I would suggest you find a way to retain the notes to the melody in your head. Simple, really. Use your voice memo app on your phone, or a similar sound-recording device. Record yourself singing the melody (don\u2019t worry, no one will hear you sing if you don\u2019t play the recording for them.) Then you have a permanent record of your brilliant melody work (mine go back 9 years!). Next, Either get an instrument you can play or find someone to play the notes for you and analyze the melody on that instrument. It can be slow going, hunting a pecking for the right notes. The step that follows depends on a couple of factors: can you play an instrument? Can you write musical notation? If not, do you have a way of writing the melody down in some system that you (and/or others) can read it and play it back? If the answer to the last 2 questions is \u2018no,\u2019 then you are left with the option of memorizing it and conveying to others by rote repetition. Though this is the slower method of conveying melody, but it will work with enough persistence. My sister and I were a song-writing team in our teens and this is the way we worked. I came up with a chord progression (usually based on a new guitar chord I had learned), then Presila would write a melody and lyrics to go with it. The downside is that now we are \u201cSeens\u201d (Seniors) and have no written record to prod our memories. I recommend that anyone dealing with music in any way, learn notation. Though musical notation is a large system, it is not as difficult to learn as most people think. You could probably start studying while you\u2019re getting that MRI! Good Luck and keep composing. Thanks for your upvote. ",

            "answer_text": "I find the melodies in my head are generally confined to a major pentatonic scale, unless I have a chord progression going around in my head first. Anyway, sing your melody into a voice memo so you don\u2019t forget it. Then try to pluck it out one note at a time on whatever instrument you have handy. There\u2019s almost certainly an app that will notate any melody you sing at it, though I haven\u2019t played with such a thing myself. Even a tuner app should work for this use; I like InsTuner. Even though it\u2019s nominally for instruments, I find it the best for singing at because of it always visible chromatic tone wheel display. ",

            "answer_text": "This answer is for a musician. You have to do the hard work of ear training. I suggest getting a Protestant hymnbook and away from your instrument sight sing the SAT and B parts. It will be hard at first but will get easy once you are halfway through. Putting in the hard work now means in the future it will all be easy. You will hear music and just know what the notes are. If you want to do it the easy way which means in the future it will still be hard, go sit down at a piano and hunt and peck for the correct notes. You won\u2019t be training your ear or brain but at least you can quickly find your notes. Option three is to find a musician and ask them. Option four is to do an online search for the song and see if there is sheet music for it. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the request John. I would suggest singing the melody and either seeking the aid of a musician who is good at playing by ear or sit down at a piano and try to match note you sing with a note on the keyboard. There may apps for this or software but I am not familiar with them. I suppose you could get an instrument tuner and see what it reads as you sing each note. ",
