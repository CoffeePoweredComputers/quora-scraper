            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to keep this short and to the point. As an EXO-L - these are SOME fans, and tbh we\u2019re equally mad at them for being so immature and coming up with their hostile behaviour towards other people. We do not support it, we do not preach it and we condemn this attitude. and I want to say this for fans from EVERY fandom. Y\u2019all don\u2019t act this way. You\u2019re only putting out negative energy and inviting it back into your life. Please think twice before you send out any sort of hate - you\u2019re not going to get anything with that negativity, instead you\u2019ll just end up badly effecting others. You do not want that, we do not want that. Let's keep spaces full of positivity. Don\u2019t do hate, do Kokobop \ud83d\udc95 - Exo. Edit : I just want to make this clear that no, I actually haven\u2019t seen any EXO-Ls threaten anyone as of yet. But cannot deny the possibility because I\u2019ve seen people from another fandom do it and have come across it personally, so thus the possibility is likely. However dear fandoms also note that questions like these pose a very negative image over fandoms and are more likely to cause fan wars. Being an EXO-L, like I cannot deny the possibility of some fans being negative and immature, you shouldn\u2019t either. Let\u2019s take responsibility. Let\u2019s be honest. My group does not see the need to support behaviour that is harmful to others and for the people themselves, and I\u2019m sure your groups don\u2019t either. So like I said before \u2018Let\u2019s not do hate, let\u2019s Kokobop\u2019 \ud83d\udc95 - EXO. ",

            "answer_text": "Now that is just disrespectful. Nobody is threatening any fandom. If they are, they don\u2019t deserve to be apart of the fandom because when you are apart of a fandom in K-Pop, you need to learn how to respect other groups\u2019 successes and wins. Making comparisons between groups is also another way to start fanwars which was a major issue last year and in 2016 especially between ARMYs (BTS fans) and EXO-Ls (EXO fans). If they are threatening or if any other fandom is making fun of some other KPOP fandom, they need to grow up and learn to mature because the number 1 rule in being a KPOP stan is to be able to respect other groups and instead of discouraging them, encourage them even if you don\u2019t stan them or even if you don\u2019t listen to them or possibly not like them. I know a lot of people were making fun of Wanna One saying that they were too overrated - NO THEY ARE NOT. They worked their ass off for Produce 101 Season 2 and that is how they became apart of Wanna One. They only have about 6 months left together as a band so PLEASE respect that. For some ARMYs, please stop bragging about BTS to other fandoms and calling them \u201cKINGS\u201d. They may be really popular and all, but please learn to respect other fandoms. Some ARMYs brag about BTS to EXO and try to fight EXO-L\u2019s. However, it\u2019s not like EXO-L\u2019s are not apart of the scene. Some EXO L\u2019s also try to brag about how EXO is more talented than BTS, or BTS can\u2019t sing live, or BTS is trash. So please GROW UP. NO THREATENING. NO DISCOURAGING. NO BRAGGING. But uplifting and respecting. All three bands have AMAZING music that they worked hard to perfect and create. I came in peace as an ARMY and an EXO\u2019L, and I will leave with the same peace.    P.S. Thanks to Chris Fo for the request to answer. ",
