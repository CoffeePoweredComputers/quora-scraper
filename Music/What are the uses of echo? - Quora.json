            "answer_text": "Where do I start. There are a plethora of things one can do with their Echo Device. Here are the things I do with mine and some things that I don\u2019t do but can be done with it. I make Phone calls with my voice by Saying Alexa call so and so on their (home or cell or work) phone or dial by number to someone whom is not listed in my cell phone. Send text messages with your voice.I make video calls to anyone with an Echo Show that has enabled and granted me permission to Drop in and I have done the same for them. Also on the Echo Show you can view videos from Dailymotion and Vimeo.I can set Timers, Reminders, and Alarms.I can add important dates to my Calendar. You can check Flight Status for any Airline as long as you know the Flight number.If you want you can Shop via Amazon Prime and make Lists: (Grocery Shopping and To-Do lists)I can control Wifi enabled Lights and Lamps (via their respective Skills).I can control Standalone Security Cameras (via their respective Skills).I can control my Home\u2019s Security System (Arming it) (via their respective Skills).I can Lock and Unlock my Door Locks (via their respective Skills).I can control my Thermostat (via their respective Skills).I can listen to Music from Pandora, Amazon Prime Music and listen to Music or News from iHeartRadio and TuneIn (if you have a SiriusXM package that includes Streaming you can use it to listen on your Echo) I have SiriusXM but only the package that allows me to listen in my car).There are a slew of 3rd Party SKILLS you can enable that will increase the functionality of the device, such as allowing you to order Pizza from Dominos or Pizza Hut, order a car from Uber or Lyft. You can listen to Sounds like Rain, Thunderstorms, Fire crackling, Ocean Waves, etc\u2026.Ask it to give you the weather forecast for your area or for another country.I have a few Games Skills enabled, such as: Jeopardy, Song Quiz and Price It Right to name a few.I have a Translation Skill enable and can ask the device to translate any phrase from most languages.Listen to Bible verses. I have this Skill enabled but don\u2019t use it much because I just actually read the Bible on my iPad instead or the actual hard cover copy I have.Listen to your favorite Podcasts.I use them as Intercoms (to use in your own home you must have more than one Echo device)It can read your Audible Books if you subscribe to that service or read your Kindle books to you (but in Alexa\u2019s voice). I don\u2019t have Audible but I do have a Kindle Books.Multi Room Music Groups. You can listen throughout your house to the same song (once again you must have more than one Echo device in your home to use Multi Room Music Groups). I have 5 devices in two groups UPSTAIRS & DOWNSTAIRS.If you own other Smart Devices you can control them using your voice as long as they support the Amazon Echo and many do. Such as: Vacuum cleaners, Garage Door openers, Lawn Sprinklers, Window Blinds and Shades, etc\u2026.There is so much more but this is just a taste of some of what it can do. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Echo which was once confined to a scene where a person shouts facing a hilly terrain receives back his/her \u201cshout\u201d after a certain time and has always been a subject of research under Sound & Acoustics section. Some of the practical uses are: Civilian ApplicationsHydro-graphic studiesThe hydro-graphic studies which are performed to measure depth of large water bodies like seas or oceans. The time taken for a sound wave to reach the seabed and bounce back as an echo to the ship helps in calculating the depth of water body at that location. Similar instruments like these are also used for discovery of marine life (using passive sonars), shipwreck, lost(underwater) cities and even minerals.  Sea Depth Mapping. Image Source: Wikipedia.  Searching for fishes using Sound. Image Source: The Fishing Website Detection of Gases in minesOne of the important characteristics of sound being, it's speed depends on the medium of propagation, the sound waves travel faster when the body becomes denser, that's the reason sound travels faster in solids than thin air. It\u2019s the same principle for different chemical composition of gases. On discovering of mineral(s) in an area, the engineers use sensors which detect gases (especially Carbon Monoxide, Methane) which are harmful for humans. These sensors\u2019 working is also based on echo received from the potential mines. 2. Military Applications Wars have been a significant (read sorrowful) part of human history. One of the main technological advancements was achieved when Submarines started prowling inside large seas and oceans. They were almost \u201cundetectable\u201d and couldn't be found by enemies until they surfaced for few moments prior to attack or other re-surface requirements. These machines were so stelathy that even on reaching close enough to attack their targets and yet the enemies had no idea about what could be lurking nearby. After a lot of decisive victories for Submarine operators, it was the time to lose their first-line-of-defense Stealth and get seen by Sonar-SOund Navigation And Ranging. These devices were and are utmost successful in detecting the underwater weapon platforms due to which defending and/or attacking gets more easier, safer and better.  Tracking and Interception of target submarine through various means. Image Source ASWTT. In the above image (from right to left) we can observe the three methods of tracking an enemy submarine. First, a warship which uses an on-board Sonar to detect the submarine; Second, an aircraft detects a submarine using a Sonobuoy; Third, a naval helicopter hovers at a location and deploys a Dipping Sonar to check for any underwater enemies. On detection the respective platform fires a weapon (here torpedo) to engage the target. Those who want to know about decoys, these are used to confuse as well mislead by \u201cluring\u201d the weapon towards it thereby protecting the host/main warship. Cheers To Science and Humanity! ",
