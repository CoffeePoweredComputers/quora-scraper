AllSides Media Bias Ratings In my personal opinion I\u2019d say CNN is much more left because they have way more pundit segments than NBC does making them seem unapologetically ULTRA-liberal. NBC does have a more moderate tone but definitely leans left. Just not as left as CNN. We all see what we want to see though right? ;) ",
