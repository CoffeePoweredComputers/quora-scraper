            "answer_text": "I am not sure exactly what song you are talking about. I know a song called \u201cOn the plains of the Buffalo\u201d, which I believe was a folk song sung among cowboys quite a long time ago, until some folk-singer decided to record it. One of the little-known tragedies in US history was that people slaughtered the buffalo, (also called Bison), and left their carcasses TO ROT, not to use it for their own food, but to deprive the Indigenous people of their main food source! This caused many to starve to death, and other to allow themselves to be herded onto Indian Reservations, which later had big pieces of land removed from the reservations, because there were resources on them that businesses wanted to exploit. A Musical version of this history is in the song \u201cNow that the Buffalo\u2019s Gone\u201d recorded by the author, Buffy Ste. Marie, and I\u2019m 99% sure that it\u2019s available on Youtube. The song I mentioned above should be on there as well. ",

            "answer_text": "Hmmm, depends on which song you refer to. Woody Guthrie wrong and sang a song titled \u201c Buffalo Skinners\u201d in 1945 but other variants of the song existed prior to that. Thus the history of the song.  The song first appeared in 1918 in a John Lomax collection of field recordings and the original song had several different titles , \"On the Trail of the Buffalo\", \"The Buffalo Skinners\" or \"The Hills of Mexico\" and \u201c Bogus Creek\u201d. The song is believed to have originated in 1873 with a fellow named John B Freeman but has been covered and reworked by many over the passage of time. In todays world the most commonly known version is that of Woody Guthrie dating back to 1945. Typical of songs of the era, it ells a story and is humorous at points. So a small slice of american history.. Enjoy.  ",
