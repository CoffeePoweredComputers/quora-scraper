Let us quote YG, \u201cI did not intend to make them different. But with look and skills\u2026\u201d I like Jennie\u2019s rap flow, she is amazing on spitting words. But CL is another level, she is on fire in every song. She simply empowering.Minzy? She is a dancing machine. I don't watch enough Lisa video as I can't focus to her, it kind of awkward for me, but Minzy had the move. Watch her in her instagram. And yeah, sorry to drag Chung Ha in, she is bloody good.Park Bom? Her voice is deep, surprisingly one of the voice that we rarely get to listen in K-pop.Dara is a very hard working woman I ever see. She is so small but she work her ass off. The combination of her and Bom is literally the sister relation we ever want.The song. Literally did Teddy lose his muse?I like some of blackpink song, like Stay and Kick It. Because it sound so good, but I still love my Go Away, I don't care, Missing you better. For me both group is good, but it just that I've been living in the era of the legend, SNSD, 2NE1 (sorry, I didn't know about K-pop during the 1st generation) so I've seen them as always better that the current generation. Just as I like Beyonce before Taylor Swift, Rihanna before Rita Ora. I've listened more of the former before the latter, thus I've always thought the former are better, but the latter ain't lacking any too. So can we stop asking question that degrading other? ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very fair to compare 2NE1 and Blackpink, considering that 2NE1 disbanded and Blackpink is continuing to grow and develop their own style of music. I think that it\u2019s because 2NE1 came before Blackpink and had the \u201cbad girl\u201d concept before them. 2NE1 was something new. Because 2NE1 came first, and had a new and fresh concept, people may think that Blackpink is a carbon copy of 2NE1, which might draw them away from Blackpink, although that\u2019s not really the case. Another factor is the managing. YG is managing Blackpink very poorly. I mean, 5 songs in 2 years? It\u2019s sad. 2NE1 did a lot more than Blackpink has done, and has been around a lot longer, though they disbanded. 2NE1\u2019s style continued to change, they had different concepts, etc. As for Blackpink, they still have the same type of music going on. Remember, YG made Blackpink debut after 2NE1 disbanded in the same year. I can\u2019t speak for everyone, though. I\u2019m a Blackjack and a Blink, and I know that each group has their strengths and weaknesses. Regardless, both groups are amazing! Continue to support 2NE1 in their solo careers and Blackpink\u2019s path to stardom!   ",
