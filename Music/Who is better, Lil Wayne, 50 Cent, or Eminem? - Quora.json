            "answer_text": "Eminem is 100% the better artist. As far as lyricism, flow, and production; when Em was in his prime he took the music world by storm! 50 Cent and Lil Wayne have enjoyed the spotlight and I commend Lil Wayne for his clever puns and lyrics but Eminem has always had more passion, ferocity, and heart in his music. I have heard many awesome lyricists but none of them have been able to match Eminem\u2019s ability to rhyme nor his ability to evoke raw emotion in his songs. Talk about a powerful artist. ",

            "answer_text": "Em. By far. Wayne sounds like he\u2019s choking on something in his flows. They seem clunky and just blah. 50 is ok but he is kind of hard to understand what he\u2019s saying. His flows are not very creative. Em has a wicked flow and great word play. His flows are smooth and feel like there\u2019s been a lot of thought put in to them. ",
