            "answer_text": "No! I don\u2019t know why people think it is, kpop is literally music that\u2019s in Korean language. But let me just put some things: Skinship: non-sexual touching. Very common in Korea amongst friends. Examples: hugging, holding hands, etc. This is the equivalent to when Europeans meet, they sometimes kiss each other on the cheeks as a greeting.Clothing: Yes, male idols can wear crop tops, heels, etc. They are wearing what fits their current concept.Makeup: both male and female idols wear makeup. Mainly for two reasons: for performances and to look nice. Korea has a much different culture (And higher beauty standards for both genders) than the west in terms of makeup. It is common for men to wear makeup, and they tend to take care of themselves more than those in the west (not all, btw) Both male and female are expected to look as perfect as they can, and makeup can definitely help. Also used to hide blemishes on camera.I hope this helped! ",
