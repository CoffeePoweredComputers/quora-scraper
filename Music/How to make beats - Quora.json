            "answer_text": "Beats: In music ,the beat is the basic unit of time,the pulse (regularly repeating event) of beat level. There are 6 steps of making beats: Get Tight Sounds: No matter how well thought out your beat is,if you are just using 808 kick and a weak general MIDI snare no one is going to want to listen your beat .it is important to find drum kits and loops with some extra flair to really make a good beat.Undersatnd the structure of beat: Different generes of music have different rules and structures for beats.most hip hop beats have syncopated kicks and a snare or clap every other bar.often,closed hi_hats are used to play 16th notes , while open hats are puts in the offbeat.Make Instrumental loops: Very few hip hop or rap beats are made without some form of repetitive loop .different rap producers use different kinds of instruments and sounds to make effective loops .the type of sounds you use to make your track should reflect the general .Emotions you want that particular track to convey an your own style.Make a Bassline: well made a bassline are subtle and add to the song rather than just arbitrarily hang in the background.Add Effects: Try adding a small amount of reverb to your snare or clap and bass boost to the kick make sure to use effects in moderation ,not to distant the track and make it unlistenable.Master the track: Make sure the beat is loud enough to be heard without overpowering the main melody.the hi_hats should be quieter than the kick and snare .",

            "answer_text": "Here's a short list of things to get good at making beats. Find demos for beat making tools and let your brain juices flow.Don't worry about the technical stuff just yet, you want to train your brain and hands to gain that connection. \u201cCan you take that amazing song in your head and lay it out flawlessly?\u201d You want to answer that question with a yes asap.Listen to your favorite beats and figure out what it is that made you like it so much. DO NOT blindly copy it. You learn a lot more from building things from scratch than to copy someone else's pieces.Don't be afraid to show your friends your first songs. They're not going to be great by any means, but there is going to be that magical day where they come from saying \u201c\u2026it's a start\u201d to \u201cdamn son, how'd you make that one part there?!\u201d And ultimately there is gona be a day where you show up to their house and drop a track and they're gona be screaming and bouncing off the walls because it's a great song lol but that takes time and attention to details.ASK your friends for their opinions, then saying it's good or bad isn't going to help you. You need specifics to actually see what's working and what's not.Find your own unique style and master it. Metro Boomin wouldn't be as big as he is if he stuck to copying someone else's pieces. His beats are mad unique and because of that it became real easy to fall in love with them beats. (The trick he does with his kicks and bass)HAVE FUN AND NEVRR LOSE HOPE! :)",
