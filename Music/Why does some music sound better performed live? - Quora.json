            "answer_text": "I have played many times live and watched famous bands live concert in my country. All I can say is as far as quality of music is concerned, studio recordings is still good to the ears. It is much like watching a blu ray movie vs being an audience on a stage play. However, a typical music enthusiast will percieve a live performance better than on recordings. This due to several factors. One is loudness. Especially on rock oriented genres, people percieve live rock concerts are better that recordings because of the loud nature of the setup. Another is the presence of musicians. People not just focus on the music but on the player of the instrument as well,or even more. Then there is the ambience. Of course nothing beats the feeling of being with the crowd cheering and giving big loud applause in every intro,instrument solo, and ending of each live songs. But for audiophiles, nothing beats the pleasure of listening to a lossless, noise free, hi fidelity recorded sound. Unlike live situations, studio recordings undergo intensive preparations and final touches and even editing to the sound of your favorite band / artist. The studio was designed to eliminate sound reverberation due to the sound bouncing through the walls. This is done by sound proofing the walls. Another thing is, most studios use high quality microphones, usually condenser types to canture the purest sound of the vocals and instruments. And lastly, I bet some doesn't really know, studios not only apply effects on vocals (other intruments such as guitars have thier own effects preferred and owned by the guitarist himself) but also on drumkits as well. Its very uncommon for every drummer to apply effects on live because the drumkit emit a very loud sound and its very difficult to achive a processed sound without the original sound intervening. On studio, its very simple. They just record the drumkit on a separate channel. Then they apply the effects afterwards to the \u201cdrumkit\" channel only. The introduction of the song Another Day in Paradise by Phil Collins is a good example of effects applied to a drumkit. ",

            "answer_text": "For several reasons music played live is a different experience. First of all because most of the times it's not as 'perfect' as the album version. Nowadays this music is often heavily edited so it sounds perfect, like timing of the band members playing (every sound will come in just exactly at the right time) and equalization. Also, in a studio it is very easy to 'overdub' a guitar for example, so you will hear several guitars on the recording while there is only one guitarist in the band. As a result of these modifications that can't be done live, live versions are different. Some people like me prefer them to studio versions because they may have more 'feel' and sound more like a real band playing together, instead of a single primarily produced by, well, a producer in a studio helped by latest technologies. Furthermore, you probably listen to your music using headphones at mid or low volume. This is very different from listening to loud live music played in front of you so you're able to hear all instruments far more better (like bass guitars). But in my opinion, in the same time they 'blend' more just as well. Just a better listen experience. For me the most important about live performances: you're able to watch the band members play. See what they look like, how they behave, what type of instruments they play, what kind of show they offer. This may make you feel/think very different about their music. ",
