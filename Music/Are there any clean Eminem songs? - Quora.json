            "answer_text": "On his first album \u201cInfinite\u201d there are several songs in which he doesn't swear or use any \u201cdirty\u201d words. Especially on \u201cIt's ok\u201d which is so special because he is actually describing his future from a point in his life that he didn't had a clue of what is going to happen. But he did made it come true. Of course he wasn't Slim Shady yet, but he was Eminem. In this song he does use the word \u201csh*t\u201d, not in a dirty context, but in a phrase (sh*t hit the fan). ",

I personally have Recovery and The Marshall Mathers LP2 -- both great, even though they're edited.  I will say they're not entirely clean, with a stray curse here and there, and sometimes, the subject matter is problematic anyway. That's to be expected. For instance, on Recovery I usually only listen to Cold Wind Blows, Talkin' to Myself, Goin' Through Changes, and Not Afraid.  That's 4/17 songs. ",

These variations often switch the swear words out that not only are clean, but also fit into the rhyme and context. If not, they leave it blank and it still usually sounds alright.
