            "answer_text": "Not so fast. \u201cAlternative\u201d covers a lot of ground. Some of the signposts I caught along the way: 1966\u2014Lou Reed and The Velvet Underground I caught live at The Cellar in Fort Worth. Their history says the band was the Exploding Plastic Inevitable until \u201967, but I remember them appearing as VU. Reed had little influence on the rock explosion of the late 60s but seemed to gain in stature and have a lot influence more than a decade later as alternative \u201cproper\u201d caught on. Hard to miss, but I\u2019ll go with Sweet Jane:  1967\u2014I spent every Tuesday night that summer at the Jade Room watching The 13th Floor Elevators with Roky Erickson. It\u2019s hard to argue that a psychedelic band was alternative in the psychedelic era, but more than a dozen years later they enjoyed a rebirth as avatars of alternative. I was even interviewed on KZSU, Stanford\u2019s radio station, because I knew the band and had met Roky after he got out of prison (looking nowhere near as handsome as his younger self). Their big hit at the time  1968\u2014My roommate Sam and I couldn\u2019t get enough of MC5, which I\u2019d call alternative as it was political rock, White Panthers, baby\u2026 the sound of the revolution! Their anthem  Those acts I consider proto-alternative. Rockabilly, the music of my grade-school years, is considered alternative by some\u2014not me. But this rockabilly artist definitely had an impact on later alternative:  Real Alternative Punk was a breath of fresh air for me. Rock had got quite insipid, and punk restored its youthful vigor. You name the band, I liked them. The band that stood out most for me was the Circle Jerks, and that had a lot to do with their appearance as the lounge band in Alex Cox\u2019s 1984 punk film Repo Man, a performance quite at odds with their more usual fare, like this:  1994\u2014My oldest son got into Jello Biafra and the Dead Kennedys well after their 70s prime. Still, hard to miss the influence of MC5:  I took the boys a couple of times to see Naoko, Bob and the Ass Baboons of Venus in the alternative category of Japanese operatic screaming. An example:  I\u2019ve always preferred the off-beat to the beat. I\u2019ll take Leningrad Cowboys, Iggy Pop, Patty Smith, Blondie or Weezer any day\u2026 White Stripe, Black Keys, Green Day. REM, U2, O.A.R. I like my music innovative and hard-driving. Hope this list alerts you to some of my faves you may not have been aware of. ",
