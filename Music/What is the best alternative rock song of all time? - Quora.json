            "answer_text": "Not so fast. \u201cAlternative\u201d covers a lot of ground. Some of the signposts I caught along the way: 1966\u2014Lou Reed and The Velvet Underground I caught live at The Cellar in Fort Worth. Their history says the band was the Exploding Plastic Inevitable until \u201967, but I remember them appearing as VU. Reed had little influence on the rock explosion of the late 60s but seemed to gain in stature and have a lot influence more than a decade later as alternative \u201cproper\u201d caught on. Hard to miss, but I\u2019ll go with Sweet Jane:  1967\u2014I spent every Tuesday night that summer at the Jade Room watching The 13th Floor Elevators with Roky Erickson. It\u2019s hard to argue that a psychedelic band was alternative in the psychedelic era, but more than a dozen years later they enjoyed a rebirth as avatars of alternative. I was even interviewed on KZSU, Stanford\u2019s radio station, because I knew the band and had met Roky after he got out of prison (looking nowhere near as handsome as his younger self). Their big hit at the time  1968\u2014My roommate Sam and I couldn\u2019t get enough of MC5, which I\u2019d call alternative as it was political rock, White Panthers, baby\u2026 the sound of the revolution! Their anthem  Those acts I consider proto-alternative. Rockabilly, the music of my grade-school years, is considered alternative by some\u2014not me. But this rockabilly artist definitely had an impact on later alternative:  Real Alternative Punk was a breath of fresh air for me. Rock had got quite insipid, and punk restored its youthful vigor. You name the band, I liked them. The band that stood out most for me was the Circle Jerks, and that had a lot to do with their appearance as the lounge band in Alex Cox\u2019s 1984 punk film Repo Man, a performance quite at odds with their more usual fare, like this:  1994\u2014My oldest son got into Jello Biafra and the Dead Kennedys well after their 70s prime. Still, hard to miss the influence of MC5:  I took the boys a couple of times to see Naoko, Bob and the Ass Baboons of Venus in the alternative category of Japanese operatic screaming. An example:  I\u2019ve always preferred the off-beat to the beat. I\u2019ll take Leningrad Cowboys, Iggy Pop, Patty Smith, Blondie or Weezer any day\u2026 White Stripe, Black Keys, Green Day. REM, U2, O.A.R. I like my music innovative and hard-driving. Hope this list alerts you to some of my faves you may not have been aware of. ",

            "answer_text": "Since you've probably listened to some big bands already, I\u2019m going to give you two bands that you\u2019ve probably never heard of. They\u2019re both from Japan, and they\u2019re both great in their own ways. Ellegarden is no longer active, but in their years of activity, they released some very solid songs. They\u2019re definitely on the more mainstream side of alternative rock, but they still rock pretty hard. I wouldn't say they were particularly innovative, but from within their comfortable pop punk sound, they made some catchy, loud, and sometimes relatively heavy songs. I haven\u2019t listened to all of their material, but some of my favorites from what I\u2019ve heard include \u201cFire Cracker,\u201d \u201cSpace Sonic,\u201d \u201cAlternative Plans,\u201d \u201cSupernova,\u201d and \u201cStereoman.\u201dIf you prefer something with more of a raw indie sound, I recommend Indigo La End. I\u2019m relatively new to them, so I can\u2019t say how their sound has changed over time. However, from their album Nagisanite, I can confidently tell you that they are a great band. The songs on the album range from energetic to melancholy. The sound is a bit raw and lo-fi, but there\u2019s still plenty of thought and vision put into how the album is crafted. The bass guitar is at least as prominent as each guitar, though all of the instruments have enough focus and are arranged very tightly. The vocalist has the sort of style that might be off-putting at first but is great when you get used to it. Off this album, I would especially recommend \u201cRakuen,\u201d \u201cRena Ha Asa Wo Ubattamitaida,\u201d and \u201cShizuku,\u201d though all of the songs are great.",

            "answer_text": "Some of my favourite alt-rock videos from 2017. Kvelertak - Nattesford  I absolutely love the direction Norwegian heavy metal band Kvelertak have taken recently, with the move away from heavy metal, towards a rock-based sound, with elements of Thin Lizzy and AC/DC thrown in. Wolf Alice - Don\u2019t Delete the Kisses  The latest Wolf Alice album throws back to a 90\u2019s sound, and drops Heathers references along with some really good proggy bits. RtJ - Nobody Speak  Run the Jewels are a hip-hop outfit, but the addition of DJ Shadow here is masterful, and the video is exceptional. Garbage - No Horses  Garbage have always been a great band, and I love that they toured with Blondie recently. This video is chilling. Feist - Century  I think the idea here was to remake Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller video, with Pulp\u2019s Jarvis Cocker doing the Vincent Price parts, or something. Feist performed this song live with Stephen Colbert doing the voice over. Slowdive - Sugar For The Pill  Slowdive came back with a new album this year after decades away from the shoegaze scene, and it is astonishingly good. They sound as good live as they do on record. Black Angels - Life Song The new Black Angels album is solid from start to finish. This video is not official, but it fits. Kind of a tribute to David Bowie\u2019s Space Oddity.  ",

So, here they are: The entire \u201cRitual de lo Habitual\u201d album by Jane\u2019s Addiction could be a good starting point.  Then, Public Image Ltd (PiL) to spice things a little.  After that, I would recommend Faith No More - Angel Dust. Great stuff.  EMF - Stigma is a hell of an album, too.  And lets not forget about Primus - Sailing the Seas of Cheese  And it would be a crime to leave Sonic Youth out of this list, so you can listen to Goo.  And the masterful Smashing Pumpkins debut, Gish.  ",
