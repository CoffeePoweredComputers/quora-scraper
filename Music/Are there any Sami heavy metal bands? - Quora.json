            "answer_text": "None really.  Some Metal bands indeed have used S\u00e1mi elements in their music (Shaman, Finntroll, Waltari) but there are no Metal band, to my knowledge, which has described or publicized itself as a \"S\u00e1mi Metal\" band. That said, there are two bands from Northern Sweden and one from Norway who most definitely use S\u00e1mi imagery, but it is impossible to say if its members identify as S\u00e1mi.  These bands are: Encyclopaedia Metallum: Vetter  Encyclopaedia Metallum: L\u00f6nndom  Encyclopaedia Metallum: Saiva  Now there are a handful of S\u00e1mi Hard-rock bands such as Intrigue (Intrigue ) or Sagittarius (Encyclopaedia Metallum: The Metal Archives ) which are sometimes kinda Heavy, but not really Metal per se.   Hope this helped ! ",

            "answer_text": "From what I have read, the Finnish band Sh\u00e0man is the only exclusively Sami-styled heavy metal band. The vocalist of Sh\u00e0man sang a few songs for a band named Finntroll. Two other black metal bands have incorporated the joik or \"yoik\" style of singing in a few of their songs; Barathrum from Finland and Arckanum from Sweden. I acquired all of this information from Wikipedia so there could be many more metal bands that I don't know of. You could also type Sami metal and joik on the Youtube search bar.  I'm sure that will show a few results... I hope this helps. ",
