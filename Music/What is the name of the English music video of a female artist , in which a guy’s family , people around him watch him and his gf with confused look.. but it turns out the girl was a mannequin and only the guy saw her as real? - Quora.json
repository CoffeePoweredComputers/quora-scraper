            "answer_text": "I believe the music video you\u2019re thinking of is the song \u201cNothing\u2019s Gonna Stop Is Now\u201d by Starship. The song was recorded by the band as a power ballad theme for the 1987 rom com \u201cMannequin\u201d. The music video features scenes from the movie as well as the two lead vocalists of Starship (Mickey Thomas and Grace Slick) that reference a mannequin coming to life for a male protagonist. The song alone went on to hit number 1 in the Billboard Hot 100. One of my all time favorite 80\u2019s hits!  ",
