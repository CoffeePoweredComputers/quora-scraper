            "answer_text": "Thank you for this question! Damn I love this song and everything about it! Well, would you like, like a synopsis of the song or the meaning verse to verse? I'm gonna answer in both ways anyway. So here's the synopsis I think this song is about two people. Chris Martin relates to fixing up the car and driving again and we're gonna get it together. Meaning a person who's lost something important and looking to get back on the right track again with the other being hopeful and helpful in making them achieve so. Searching for the water and hoping for the rain being the person going through suffering, being poor ( meal to meal) the hopeful person tries to encourage to rise and soar above the storm. Instead of lying in the gutter you've got to experience it all, and every seed can be fruitful if nurtured. Towards the end Chris tries to say that everyone has a different perspective for everything and one can either accept it or get what they want. They'll get there together if they believe in themselves, their aspirations and by believing in love. That being said, let's take a look at verse to verse lyrics to get a better insight Fixing up a car to drive in it againSearching for the water, hoping for the rainUp and up, Up and up Down upon the canvas, working meal to mealWaiting for a chance to pick your orange fieldUp and up, Up and up Pretty poetic but imagine your life as a vehicle and the road being the journey, obviously there's gonna be ups and downs but you've got to move on, got to fix it, you've got to try to search the water, the attempt, hoping to rain,here being the success. The next part focuses on the world as a whole, relating it to a canvas. A person can be less fortunate, earning the minimum on a day to day basis but still has to hope to reach the top. The orange field as described here. See a pearl form, a diamond in the roughSee a bird soaring high above the floodIt's in your blood, It's in your blood A pearl being formed with patience, a diamond isn't worth till it's polished, a bird soars high rather than opting the hide-out during a calamity. Here they're trying to encourage us to be patient, polish and practice on our skills, and come through when the times are tough. Underneath the storm an umbrella is sayingSitting with the poison takes away the painUp and up, Up and up This particular verse has quite a deep meaning. There's an umbrella suffering in rain, has a heavy burden and no escape, but the umbrella says \u201csitting with the poison takes away the pain\u201d meaning if you've already prepared yourself for the worst, your version of worse may not happen and that might make you feel that this wasn't as hard as I expected it to be. Well of course everyone's got a different sense of perception so I accept your look towards this as well. We\u2019re gonna get it, get it togetherI know we\u2019re gonna get it, get it together somehowWe\u2019re gonna get it, get it together and flower We\u2019re gonna get it, get it togetherI know, we\u2019re gonna get it, get it together and floatWe\u2019re gonna get it, get it together and goUp, and up, and up Self explanatory. Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moonTrying to empty out the ocean with a spoonUp and up, up and up We can't aim at something high or keep a goal without having to hustle, get uncomfortable or out of the comfort zone, since that's meaningless, said here as trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon. How come people suffer? How come people part?How come people struggle? How come peopleBreak your heart? Break your heart? Yes I wanna grow, yes I want to feelYes I wanna know, show me how toHeal it up, heal it up Chris says that he wants to experience, he wants to suffer, he wants to learn and make mistakes. He wants to feel hurt and heal it so as to have a better insight about everything. See the forest there in every seedAngels in the marble waiting to be freedJust need love, Just need loveWhen the going is rough, saying Every seed has a the capability to give birth to a forest, if you nurture it, care about it. Relating this to our lives, each and every one of us can achieve anything, we're all like the marble angels, free by its feature, but stationary in reality. If we are nurtured, raised, mentored, loved, we can be infinite. BRILLIANCE BY COLDPLAY! We\u2019re gonna get it, get it togetherI know we\u2019re gonna get it, get it together somehowWe\u2019re gonna get it, get it together and flower We\u2019re gonna get it, get it togetherI know, we\u2019re gonna get it, get it together and floatWe\u2019re gonna get it, get it together and go Self explanatory And you can say what is, or fight for itClose your mind or take a riskYou can say it\u2019s mine and clench your fistOr see each sunrise as a gift Every person has a different perception about everything, few people do something about it. Few don't. Some accept their way of life, some change it. Some take risks, some don't. Some can either have an attitude towards attaining something no matter what, where as some are grateful for what they have. Hence the relativity. We're gonna get it, get it togetherI know we\u2019re gonna get it, get it together somehowWe\u2019re gonna get it, get it together and flower We\u2019re gonna get it, get it togetherI know, we\u2019re gonna get it, get it together and floatWe\u2019re gonna get it, get it together and goUp, and up, and We\u2019re gonna get it, get it togetherI know we\u2019re gonna get it, get it together somehowWe\u2019re gonna get it, get it together and flower We\u2019re gonna get it, get it togetherI know, we\u2019re gonna get it, get it together and floatWe\u2019re gonna get it, get it together and goUp, and up, and up Fixing up a car to drive in it againWhen you\u2019re in pain, when you think you\u2019ve had enoughDon\u2019t ever give upDon\u2019t ever give up Believe in love Again, self explanatory I hope you liked my view. Let me know if you have a different outlook. Cheers :) ",

            "answer_text": "It is about rebuilding and growth. In a relationship, there are bad phases when you fight a lot and argue on just about everything. Right when it feels like it\u2019s broken, the song sparks this idea of \u201cfixing up a car and driving it again\u201d and not losing hope in the bond and it then moves on to this whole concept of fate saying \u201cwe\u2019re gonna get it, get it together somehow\u201d. It\u2019s this belief that is reflected throughout the song, and is something that Chris Martin must\u2019ve been holding on to throughout his divorce with Gwyneth Paltrow\u2026 ",
