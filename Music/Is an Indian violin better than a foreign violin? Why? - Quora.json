            "answer_text": "So it depends on what you mean by foreign. The best violins, as any pro will tell you, come from late 18th and 19th century Germany. These can range from thousands to upwards of 100k USD for a rare original Stradivarius. Then come Czech, Italian and UK's baroque violins from the same time period. Then come 20th century and 21st century German violins. Then Czech and Italian 20th century violins. Then we come to the Chinese violins. There are two broad grades, average and horrible. In India, we only receive the 'horrible' variety, usually around 10k INR. In America, you can get the average variety, but for about 2x the price. Its a big divide. Then come Japanese violins. Last comes our humble Indian violin. Made cheap, from poor grade wood and with usually extremely sub par construction quality, they are really not worth more than 5k INR. All professional Carnatic musicians I know use German violins. There is simply no better. And a well used violin's always better than a new one. ",
