            "answer_text": "It was a tribute to the 18th century poet and artist Vincent Van Gogh. Who suffered from depression and took his own life (committed suicide). It is a sad and poignant story. Because back then, anyone who suffered from a depressive illness was usually ostracized by society. It flared up and caused others around them to become frightened and sometimes would have them unfairly incarcerated, etc. especially into an insane asylum. Van Gogh, it is presumed, was to have suffered from manic-depressive illness. But at the time there was nothing to give him to alleviate the severe symptoms of it, there were no psychotropic drugs and or therapies around back in his days. I don\u2019t know very much about Van Gogh, only what I have heard from others and what I have seen and heard about him in the media. He also cut his own ear lobe off and bled to death. That is how he took his own life. He may have suffered from (auditory hallucinations) paranoid schizophrenia. Again they didn\u2019t know what it was back then, and the only treatment for it was to be confined to an asylum. ",
