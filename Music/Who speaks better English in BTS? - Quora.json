            "answer_text": "I think the order would go something like this: 1- Number one would obviously be RM, its something he learned while he was young through watching Friends which is SO awesome, the power of American television! Plus his IQ boom, you have fluent speaking RM. 2- I think in the second spot it would actually be Jin, Jin seems to know how to formulate sentences more than other members and he can read english seriously well! It seems he learned quite well in school and university and for sure other factors. He also integrates english with terrible Korean dad jokes! (Bless him xD) 3- Here I was kind torn between Jungkook and Suga, because Jungkook seems to have a higher ability in English than Suga, but fact is Suga has a better understanding of English than Jungkook. Suga for some reason doesn\u2019t display speaking english as much, but he seems to REALLY understand, he\u2019s caught several times either answering back in Korean or nodding his head after the question has been asked. So it seems he understands well but doesn\u2019t practice it as often as othet members. 4- I think third would be Jungkook, his accent seems really good and constantly tries to learn words from RM or others. He can express himself through a few words and sentences that are quite correct structually and phonetically. He also keeps trying to learn new words and usually in BTS songs where there\u2019s English he pronounces really well, but I think his ability to understand English is as high as Suga\u2019s. 5-Jimin can speak some words and has a good accent, he seems to know how to imitate words and sentences heard from others, as for understanding it isn\u2019t that clear, but I think to an extent he does. He pronounces quite well. Jimin, you nice, Keep going! 6-J-hope, who can forget dirty water faceu? (If you\u2019re not familiar with this I highly recommend checking the Bangtan bomb video where they all try to speak English, also this video has the infamous \u201cJimim you go no Jams\u201d!). Anyways, J-Hope also pronounces quite well, but I wouldn\u2019t say he knows what\u2019s being said like Suga or Jin. 7- V, this boy\u2026oh boy\u2026he needs work, his pronounciation can be a hit or a miss sometimes, sometimes he pronounces really well and sometimes it turns out \u201csex porn star\u201d! (That\u2019s also another video where they were being interviewed) Hahah, but serioulsy he\u2019s come a long way! His ability in understanding English isn\u2019t all that clear, but it seems like he\u2019s getting there. Also, his English reading isn\u2019t that bad! Overall, I think they\u2019re ALL seriously improving! They\u2019re all trying harder to speak English and trying to learn more words and more sentences. They\u2019ve all come a long way! ",

            "answer_text": "Of all the members, Kim Namjoon (the president of K-pop. alias: RM) is the most fluent, having learned it not only from watching the show Friends (yes you read that right), but also studied abroad in New Zealand. He also spoke at the United Nations!!! There are presumptions that Suga is secretly fluent in the language, despite claiming he does not know it. Maybe he doesn't like to speak it (I don't like speaking French or Nepali either, I get it man), but I do believe he understands it very well. I mean he watched Endgame in LA at a movie theater a couple of days ago, so this implies that he does understand the language. The rest of the members are hit or miss in terms of fluency in the language. Jin studied abroad briefly; he is believed to be able to read and understand the language very well, but not speak it (like Suga\u2019s case). Hobi, Jimin and V speak basic English, but Hobi's English has been improving significantly, specifically when he talks to the audience at concerts (my heart flutters when I see those videos on Twitter). I don't really hear V and Jimin speak English, so I can\u2019t judge/rank them. Jungkook is currently learning English, hoping he could one day be able to help RM translate for the group during their English interviews. He says it is difficult, but he is trying. I love you JK and am so proud for what you do. You got this, I know it!!! So, to rank their English levels (from most to least fluent and ability to understand it), it would be Namjoon, Suga, Jin, Jungkook/Hobi (about the same level), V and Jimin. This is my personal opinion and I am no expert on languages in ANYWAY (I can barely speak English, despite being American lol). They're trying really hard and I'm so proud of them no matter what!!! Hey guys, feel free to correct me if I provided any misinformation. Thanks!!! ",
