            "answer_text": "I don't have a favorite song, and I honestly don't think I've ever truly had a favorite song. For me, it depends on how I'm feeling. Some days, I prefer songs like Nine in the Afternoon (Panic! At the Disco), and other times, I prefer calm, or even sad music. Currently, a lot of the songs that I enjoy listening to most are Miike Snow songs, like Devil's Work, The Rabbit, and Back of the Car. I'm the type of person who generally enjoys the actual music more than the singing, and I really enjoy focusing in on the background instruments of those songs, and many others. The more complicated and cooler sounding the actual music is, the better, and usually the songs that I end up loving for a long time are the ones with great background music. A good singer is just a bonus. I'm also into music from musicals, specifically Newsies and Hamilton. The music from Hamilton is possibly some of my favorite of all time. It mainly fits into the rap and hip hop genres, and the music is done so amazingly that it's hard to believe that basically all of it was done mainly by Lin-Manuel Miranda. I like the story it conveys, and how it's historically accurate. In my opinion, that just makes the music and songs even better than they already were. The pace in each of the songs fits the mood well that I can almost imagine myself in the setting it takes place in. Newsies does this as well, I'm just obsessed with Hamilton the an almost unhealthy degree. All in all, music is great, and if I honestly talked about all of the songs I love, it could probably be turned into a novel (no joke, I'm serious when it comes to loving music). ",

            "answer_text": "I know and love so many songs it is impossible to name a \"best\" one. It depends on my mood and the occasion. I drive my kids mad by singing a line from a song containing almost any word or thing they say. I will name a few which I like best. I like them best because they are \"worthy\". ie they express an idea or sentiment which benefits human kind and they do it with a good melody and music which resonates well. Imagine - John LennonWhen I'm 64 - BeatlesBlowin' in the Wind - Bob Dylan Jesus Christ Superstar (Full opera) - Lloyd-Weber & RiceMatilda, the Musical (All songs) - Tim Minchin Having listed the above, I can see that I am drawn to songs which invite me to think and ponder. Other favourites are listed by composer: Most Queen songs - Bohemian Rhapsody, We are the Champions, Bicycle, Somebody to Love, Don't Stop Me now Most Billy Joel songs - Always a Woman, Just the Way you are, Allan Town, Piano Man, Goodnight Saigon Most Simon & Garfunkel - Bridge Over Troubled Waters, Scarborough Fair, Mrs Robinson, El Condor Paso, Sounds of Silence Most Seekers - The Carnival is over, Georgy Girl, Morningtown Ride Most Gilbert & Sullivan - Pirates of Penzance, Mikado, Gondoliers Tom Leherer - Vatican Rag, Poisoning Pigeons in the Park, Be prepared, Masochism Tango, A Christmas Carol [These are wickedly tongue-in-cheek.] Eric Bogle - And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda, Green Fields of France Dolly Parton - Islands in the Stream, I will Always Love You Rogers and Hammerstein - Sound of Music, Oklahoma, South Pacific ABBA - Mama Mia, Waterloo, Fernando, Dancing Queen, The Winner Takes it All, Name of the Game Meatloaf - Bat out of Hell album Neil Diamond, Leo Sayer, Carly Simon, Taylor Swift, Adele, David Bowie, John Paul Young, Buddy Holly, Don McLean ... plus many British Isles folk songs - Drunken Sailor, Lavenders' Blue,  Cockles & Mussels,  Popular songs from the 1850s to 1950s Some religious songs - eg Amazing Grace, Ave Maria (Gounod), Ave Verum Corpus (Mozart), Jesu Joy of Man's Desiring (JS Bach), Christmas Carols I also like many Catches [17th - 19th C] because they are clever and funny. ...so many songs...
