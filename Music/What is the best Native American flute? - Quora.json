            "answer_text": "The best flute is the one in my hand at the time, singing our song together. Beyond that, there is no \u201cbest\u201d flute. Each flute is an individual. Even two \u201cidentical\u201d flutes made by the same maker on the same day will have slight variations in voice and song. That is part of what I find appealing with Native American flutes. Now, if you are looking for a recommendation for buying a first flute, I have no reservation about pointing you towards High Spirit flutes. Ordell Borg produces high quality flutes, and I find his flutes to be some of the most consistent. High Spirits flutes are relatively easy to find, and can also be ordered from their website. I also really like flutes made by Dana Ross of Falcon Flutes. His flutes seem to have a bit more character than the High Spirit flutes, and are beautifully finished. If you can, the best way to buy a flute is to find a place that has flutes from several different makers. You will have a chance to try the flute before you buy it, and find the one that best fits you. I have yet to find a store that does not allow you to pay before buying. If a store did have that policy, they would not have me as a customer. ",

            "answer_text": "As a seller of these flutes since 2006 and having sold over 1000 flutes I can tell you that there are definitely some flutes that are better than others. I personally do not like to use the term best without having an understanding of what the person asking the question means. It has been my experience that a flute I may not care for sound quality provides an immediate and unexpected connection to someone else and they fall in love with it. Having said that there are several ways to determine the quality of the sound of a flute: when the whistle block is in the correct position on the flute, do you like the sound of the flute when you play ittest all of the fingering positions that you can on the flute to see if it reaches them with the quality of sound that you likeDoes the flute water up after playing it for only a short timeAre the sound holes cut straight and is the finish of the flute on the inside smoothThere are many factors that help determine the quality of a flute. One of my favorite flute players, Anthony Natividad, says to play the flute and let the flute teach you. Even you have a flute in your hands that you do not care for very much or find it difficult to play, when you allow yourself to listen to the flute you will find its song. ",
