            "answer_text": "Sometimes. It\u2019s good to release your feelings and if you have something to cry about crying yourself to sleep will make you feel better. It gets you out of the \u2018freeze\u2019 part of fight/flight/freeze. It\u2019s important to express your emotions without being melodramatic\u2014which is also not authentic. Bottled up emotions CAN hurt you. Expressed feelings usually move you on. So you are crying yourself to sleep and that should cause you to start to take action to alleviate, alter or progress from the events that are causing the tears. It\u2019s good to have a genuine cry. It\u2019s bad to ruminate and stay stuck. Even if you do nothing about the event or situation that caused the tears it will fade into the past if you let it. The world is strange at the moment. It\u2019s trying to reorganize into something new. The failings of the old ways are coming to light. There has been a bit of a mess made of humanity. We need a huge shift. There are going to be tears for anyone that is aware and there are personal tragedies in life too. We\u2019re all moving forward. ",

            "answer_text": "Yeah, it's okay to cry yourself to sleep. It's just a form of expressing your feelings, anyway, and it's healthy. Besides, crying has actual benefits to us[1], so it has its positive impact to our wellbeing. It's the reason why you're crying that matters. While crying may calm your grief from a loss of a loved one, continuously grieving may cause your life miserable and affect your health eventually, no matter how much and how hard you cry yourself to sleep. Or, perhaps, you often cry in silence in your bed because you suffer from domestic violence, which of course, should be dealt by asking help from the authorities, because prolonged abuse will cause irreversible damage to your body and mind. Or, you cry every night because you never able to ask a girl out? Well, I . . . can't help you with that because I'm fat and ugly, and I also have the same problem. Maybe ask a friend to hook you up with someone they know? So, yes, crying yourself to sleep is okay, it even has its own positive impact to your body. Just deal with the cause of your crying, and move on. Hope it helps, and happy sleeping, my friend! Footnotes[1] https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319631.php",
