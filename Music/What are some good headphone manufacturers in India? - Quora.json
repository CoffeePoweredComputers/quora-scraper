            "answer_text": "If you would have asked me this question a year ago then I probably would have said Bose or Sony as I am a big-time fan of these two brands. But, when it comes to technology, it is changing really fast. I recently thought of trying something different and bought World Of Play PlayGO BH70 headphones by just looking at its price which is almost half of Bose headphones. Trust me I was thinking that all my money will go down the drain and I will give it to my cousin but to my utter surprise these headphones have beaten the expensive ones in all areas. They have the latest Bluetooth 5 version whereas the latest Sony or Bose headphones sport some 4 point something version. Then, obviously they have the most popular active noise cancellation technology. They have some of the most amazing features like gesture-based Touch & Talk, Auto Play n Pause and AI Algorithm which puts the advanced machine learning into headphones for a customised experience. After using them, I realized that I have been wasting my time and money all these times. And have decided not to run after expensive brands. World Of PLAY is seriously a great brand and they just don\u2019t create products, they craft futuristic devices for the best experience. ",
