Arise, children of the fatherland,The day of glory has arrivedAgainst us tyranny'sThe bloody standard is raisedListen to the sound in the fieldsThe howling of these fearsome soldiersThey are coming into our midstTo cut the throats of your sons and consorts To arms, citizens. Form your battalionsMarch, marchLet impure bloodWater our furrows What do they want this horde of slavesOf traitors and conspiratorial kings?For whom these vile chainsThese long-prepared irons?Frenchmen, for us, ah! What outrageWhat methods must be taken?It is us they dare planTo return to the old slavery! What! These foreign cohorts!They would make laws in our courts!What! These mercenary phalanxesWould cut down our warrior sonsGood Lord! By chained handsOur brow would yield under the yokeThe vile despots would have themselves beThe masters of destiny tremble, tyrants and traitors The shame of all good menTremble! Your parricidal schemesWill receive their just rewardAgainst you, we are all soldiersIf they fall, our young heroesFrance will bear new ones Ready to join the fight against youFrenchmen, as magnanimous warriorsBear or hold back your blowsSpare these sad victimsThat they regret taking up arms against usBut not these bloody despotsThese accomplices of Bouill\u00e9All these tigers who pitilesslyRipped out their mothers' wombs We too shall enlistWhen our elders' time has comeTo add to the list of deedsInscribed upon their tombsWe are much less jealous of surviving themThan of sharing their coffinsWe shall have the sublime prideOf avenging or joining them Drive on sacred patriotismSupport our avenging armsLiberty, cherished libertyJoin the struggle with your defendersUnder our flags, let victoryHurry to your manly toneSo that in death your enemiesSee your triumph and our glory!

            "answer_text": "I found this article with a much better translation! And an explanation of why this song was written. It was a war cry. Read on! What are the lyrics to the French National Anthem, La Marseillaise \u2013 and what do they mean? Note: the article translates \u201ccompagnes\u201d as \u201ccomrades\u201d. This is incorrect. Compagnes = feminine. compagnons = masculin. So, it should say: \u201cthey are coming right into your arms to slit the throats of your sons and your wives. \u201c That would make more sense as a translation. ",
