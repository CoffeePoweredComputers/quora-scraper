            "answer_text": "Once again I have to point out that Karaoke is not a form or genre of music. Karaoke is a social pastime wherein people are encouraged to sing regardless of their ability. They are not singing Karaoke they are singing songs. Not everyone who sings will do so badly. I am a KJ but also visit Karaoke bars for fun. I sing passably well. I'm not good enough to be a professional singer but people tell me they enjoy hearing me sing. There are people singing for a living on the island I call home who don't sing as well as many I hear in Karaoke. I have heard others sing, who are good enough to be, and some who actually were professional singers. So to say categorically that singing at Karaoke is bad is an inaccurate generalisation. In general the overall standard is not high in the same way that there are generally more bad than good golfers in a golf club, but to say \u201cWhy are club golfers so bad?\u201d is not accurate or true.

            "answer_text": "Because you have music that plays a song that you either do not know or an accompaniment is new to you. It is not like singing a song with a teach or a piano accompanist playing for you. Trying to copy other singer\u2019s is kinda bad also. Though if you like to sing for fun you would like karaoke. Maybe you have a negative attitude about what people do for enjoyment. Karaoke is singing for fun and not doing a concert. It means that many people are not prepared and have not learned the songs that they were trying to sing. Some people do okay and some do not so well if they are not experienced in being a karaoke singer. It is understandable that singing to a recorded accompaniment is hard unless you know the song really well and can do the timing. But most people that enjoy karaoke are amateurs and are not professional singers. It is not like the sing songs that were written for them or their voices sometimes. But all they is enjoy something that is just for fun. ",
