Here in the UK we would generally say \u201cexactly the same thing\u201d; I hear \u201cthe exact same thing\u201d more from Americans. I have to be honest and admit that I am not sure whether \u201cthe exact same thing\u201d is, strictly speaking, grammatical, but it has become so ingrained in Americans\u2019 every day speech that it doesn\u2019t even sound wrong to me.
