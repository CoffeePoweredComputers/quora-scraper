            "answer_text": "They are very different, and are their own people. They are both amazing artists and extremely talented. Miley\u2019s vocal range is Instantly recognizable voice accompanied by her unique tone. Soulful rasp (see \"Jolene\" and \"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go) that allows genre transitions such as Pop, Rock, Country and Blues. An expansive chest/mixed range, stretching 3 octaves, while the range overall stretches an impressive 4 octaves. Insanely resonant and healthy lower register, where C3s which are usually difficult for most female singers sound like middle register notes. The lower register is achieved (for the most part) without lowering the larynx, and has been able to project down to E2 with ease. She is able to stay in and around the 2nd octave for extensive periods without issue (very impressive for a female). Taylor\u2019s voice overall has a pleasant timbre that is very sweet and gentle, and can convey emotions by experimenting (somewhat) with rhythmic figures and articulation to match the moods of her songs. Ability to hold notes for long periods of time with good stamina and no wavering in pitch, and pluck between head voice and chest voice very easily. A dark lower register that Swift finds herself generally comfortable in. As she ascends, her voice becomes more feminine and \"peppy,\" with a slight, sharp edge. Her tessitura is relatively low for a soprano, settling around the B4-D5 range. Sweet head voice. Either way, we shouldn\u2019t compare 2 insanely talented people. Tay said it best: We see you over there on the Internet Comparing all the girls who are killing it We figured you out We all know now We all got crowns You need to calm down Here are some of my personal favourite songs(all live to show their real talent):  Miley at the Jingle Ball in 2013 singing Wrecking Ball  Betty Live (idk the year and I'm too lazy to check lmao)  We Can\u2019t stop live at snl  The famous Love Story, *bows down*  Malibu, *amazing*  ME! in Paris  At the VMAs Slide Away  Karen don't be sad at snl Here are a few recent ones:  At Whisky Go Go, ZOMBIE!(cover)  Boys don't be sad (cover)  Midnight Sky\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764  I got so high that I saw jesus   PICTURESS!!

            "answer_text": "Taylor Swift is many times ahead of Miley Cyrus here. I love both of them,but honestly speaking, Miley\u2019s country stint was not at all relevant. She became bigger because of H&M and her pop albums.Taylor\u2019s country days are still praised and remembered till today as her country albums were both critically and commercially acclaimed.She dug her way through the mainstream audience which is a rarity for country music and because of her many people,including me,started to enjoy the genre.Miley\u2019s albums were good but it did nothing noticeable while Taylor\u2019s country albums were so approachable and appreciated. Taylor\u2019 sophomore album Fearless is the most awarded country album of all time,which speaks depths about her country superiority over Miley whose country stint hardly got any acclaim or recognition Both woman are inspirations and i honestly enjoy listening to both.
