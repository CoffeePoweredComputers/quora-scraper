            "answer_text": "Pandora= I use this website here in there. You don't pick up your songs but it's an easy thing to use when you're driving and you want to listen to music. AccuRadio= Its pretty similar to Pandora but you have the ability to change song whenever you want. I don't really use this site anymore now but it was one of my first sites I used. Spotify= It's what I use all the time now. I have a bunch of playlist that I can make my own. I usually use it on my laptop so I can pick which songs to listen to and have free skips on my playlist. I can't get enough of this website. Grooveshark= This site I don't believe exist anymore but I just wanted to point it out. You get to choose the song you wanted and my favorite thing was how you can make your own little music radio station. It was so cool on how I would get people listening live but sadly there's no more Grooveshark. :( YouTube topic= Well this isn't really a music site but you can search up an artist on YouTube and write topic right after it. It will show you music videos from the artist and full albums. ",

            "answer_text": "Pandora - I use through PandoraJam on my desktop. I just love how accurately it selects related music and is an excellent resource to discover music that you may have never heard before. Grooveshark - Use it sometimes for a quick run through of current hits, but have never really liked their playlist setup.  Last.fm - Mainly have it to sync all the music I listen to to my LifeStream and other social media. It automatically picks up songs when I use iTunes (through GimmeSomeTune), music player on Android OS, or PandoraJam. We Are Hunted - http://www.wearhunted.com \"99 Most Popular Emerging Songs\" - Excellent site to pick up a huge variety of music from around the world. Streams by loading music from YouTube. TheSixtyOne - Excellent for variety once again, good for a quick music fix. Spotify - Has to be my absolute favorite... but I've only tried it once for the \"travel period.\" Cannot wait until this finally comes to the US once and for all. The list of songs is incredible and is one of the best full-feature streaming players out there (IMO). Just signed up for rdio.com and will definitely be checking out some of the other sites mentioned. ",
