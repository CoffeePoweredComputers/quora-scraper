            "answer_text": "Not sure if they\u2019d make you feel good specifically about being single, but I\u2019d recommend listening to some Nightwish. Finnish metal band, with the vast majority of their songs discussing life, rather than love. I like them because a lot of their music is philosophical, and the very fact that it\u2019s symphonic metal should be enough to increase your heart rate a bit. I\u2019m afraid that my taste in music a heck of a long way from normal, but that would be what I\u2019d suggest if you don\u2019t want to listen to music about being in love (as unfortunately, the vast majority of music is). Thanks for the request to answer, and I hope that my suggestion - despite being outwith the normal range of answers you\u2019re likely to receive - is useful. ",
