            "answer_text": "I will try my best friend... There are many genres in music... I will concentrate on the common genres though.. Romantic This genre is all about love.. the songs have lyrics which are touching to heart and makes you feel that love is everything.. In Hindi the best example is pehla nasha song. Similarly in English Love me like you do by Ellie. Again this genre is further subdivided into fast romantic and slow romantic which is purely based on the pace of song.Party This genre is based described as songs which you usually want to listen on picnic trips or in a pub or bar. They are the songs which is not completely serious dance but makes you tap your feet or hands. One Hindi example is Lungi dance and in English you can listen to rappers like Eminem or Metallica. They make you tap your feet but not exactly dance like professional dancers.Dance This genre is often confused with party. Well according to me these are either the songs which you usually choose for your dance competitions or songs to which you listen on marriages. They are more louder than party songs but have some great music which can be used to dance seriously. MJ's songs can be classified as dance songs. But many songs are there which can be both party and dance.Devotional It's easy to understand as the songs main motive is to pray God or call him to listen to us. In Hindi there are large number of devotional songs. Tumhi ho maata pita tumhi ho is one example.I find these are some important and popular genre of Hindi or English songs. Hope this answer helps you a little... ",
