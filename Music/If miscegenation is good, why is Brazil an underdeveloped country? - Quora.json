            "answer_text": "If you compare Brazil and US that have about the same age. Brazil had a different history, different kingdom occupying and exploiting the land with different reasons. Brazil is farer from Europe than North America. The vegetation of Brazil was exponentially denser than in North America. Brazil had a Monarchic Age, with the Portuguese Court Living in South America. Brazil had Oligarchies of farmers corrupting the government since the beginning, and these land owners are one of the major causes of underdevelopment. (It is said that if in US Civil War, if US was broken into two different countries, the North US would be developed like East European countries, while South US, that relied their economy on agriculture and slave labor, would be just like the other Latin America countries. With land owners, rural oligarchies, corrupting the government to ensure their interests\u2026.. It was the North that could guarantee US position today) Portugal didn\u2019t want to develop the colony, only exploit. The flee of the Portuguese royal family to Brazil brought some development although. The late industrialization had all to do with farmers oligarchies in the positions of power for so long\u2026. and they are still there until today\u2026.. And until today the world demands from Brazil and expects from Brazil huge amounts of food, beef, soy, corn, sugar, chicken, fruits\u2026. And I say HUGE amounts. And plus, It is expected that Brazil increases the food production by 40% in 10 years to meet the world demand toward to global feeding security. This demand implies less industrialization, less worries about education and slower technologic development.The past years, Brazil kind of \u201cfed\u201d China\u2019s meteoric ascension, sending so much food that China could afford to develop so well, so fast (of course, among may other factors, not just food). Today, Brazil\u2019s position in the world is majority as a food producer, iron producer, oil producer\u2026 And that\u2019s how the game is settled. It depends not on the people, it\u2019s politics. A Role was defined for Brazil in the World\u2019s game, and Brazil must fulfil theses expectations. There is nothing to do with miscegenation\u2026 But if the question was put in a different perspective, Brazil is very developed. Because even with the history of exploitation and corruption in politics, Brazil managed somehow to be one of the biggest economies in the world >>PEACEFULLY<< and how many other developed countries can claim that? Brazil managed to miscegenate, instead of slaughter the natives and apartheid black and white. Brazil managed to be friend of US, China, Russia, Europe and everybody, Brazil managed to congregate bunches and bunches of different religions, tones of skins, phenotypic traces under a secular democratic government. It is also a road to development. It may be a slower route. But the foundations for a healthy and peaceful development are set. ",

            "answer_text": "We are all Human Beings. That is our \u201crace\u201d. The differences we have are what we look like, , our different beliefs, style of living, the way we dress, but as time goes on, we are becoming less ignorant about these differences and embrace all these different things and enjoy them. After all they are all Human type attributes. I would not say the Brazil is an underdeveloped country. There is a lot of poverty, which is a problem on many places on earth. Even London has this problem to a lesser degree, today. Only just over a century ago London had massive differences, between the Rich and Poor. Children used to go hungry and beg in the street. My grandfather, who was a church man, raised money to help the poor, and also helped with his daughter in St Martins in the Field Church, to feed the poor at Christmas; and helped to get boot blacking kits for boys, so that they would be able to earn money. Little boys in the snow in London, would pick up horse manure to sell to other poor people so they could make fires in their hearths, and keep warm in winter. My father said it was terrible to see this extreme poverty an how much the richer people had and seem to take it for granted. The poor women used to scrub their floors so very clean, as that was all they had to have pride in. Poverty is the bane of the world, and keeps people from improving their lives. That was how London was back then, even though she was the richest country in the world at that time. Now we are much more equal. but still there are problems to do with poverty and exploitation. London has all kinds of people in it from all over the world, and many contribute marvellous things to this place, and the world. All kinds of human beings from every part of the world, are surgeons for example and they and perform fantastically difficult surgery to save peoples lives in London, and improve their broken bodies. Arabs and European and African surgeons fly with an organisation to places where people cannot see and these patients are able to see within a few hours, and then the planes take off again and fly to another place in the world where they can save many people\u2019s sight. All this is because of education, which enables people from any background to achieve the most marvellous things and improve life for everybody. Obama came from Kenya and was educated in America, as the USA, had programmes to help educate people in Africa. He then became president of the United States. Politicians have to have the insight to create organisations to help make Education and health services happen, without destroying the country, and the natural world. If you looked further than Brazil, you would be able to find places that are far worse off. The main problem of the whole world is greed from some, and exploitation of those in need. We have to get ride of poverty. Cynthia McLaglen ",
