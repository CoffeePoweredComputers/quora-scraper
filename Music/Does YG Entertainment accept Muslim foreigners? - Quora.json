            "answer_text": "Honestly, I think they hardly do. The religion itself is pretty strict and as we all know, K-pop is all about the fans. Idols tend to wear revealing outfits and have skinship with fans. Even if YG do accept Muslim foreigners, the Muslim people would leave plenty of hate comments for you, telling you that you\u2019re disrespecting the religion. I\u2019m sorry to say this but I don\u2019t think it is a good decision to be a trainee. It isn\u2019t a good decision to be one from the start. Muslims would have it worse. ",
