The article specifically addresses the term \"cold medina\", with Flav recounting a conversation between himself and Tone Loc:   \"Tone Loc, one day, said, 'Yo Flav, what's \"Cold Medina\" man?' I said, 'It means cold pumpin', no slumpin', it's the bag you wanna be jumpin.' I said, 'Yo, you should use that in one of your records, man, I'm tellin' you.'\" And Flav has claimed credit for the popular term ever since. ",
