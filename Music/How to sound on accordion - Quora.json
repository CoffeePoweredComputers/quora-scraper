            "answer_text": "I actually still sound pretty good on the accordion. I started taking accordion lessons 58 years ago when I was 5 years old. I had a rather different sort of teacher in that he was an old jazz saxophonist who taught me to improvise along with theory and playing from sheet music. I can still squeeze out a pretty mean \u201cBeer Barrel Polka\u201dand \u201cLady of Spain\u201d as well as improvise with a Mariachi band. I can also do the \u201cbellows shake\u201d which was a pretty great physical achievement for a young boy. I moved on to piano when I was about 11 and stuck with that as my performance instrument of choice, but I still drag out the old accordion once in a while for recording projects or for my own amusement.
