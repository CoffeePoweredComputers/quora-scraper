            "answer_text": "The answer really depends on how you\u2019re looking at the evolution of music, and then what sort of genre you\u2019re into. I mean Baroque and what we now consider Classical music is probably the most important step towards moving music out of just the very elite salons and into public performance spaces (yes it was still expensive and mostly elite, but it made that first step). After that it\u2019s a matter of taste - depending on what sort of music you like, there\u2019s so many important events and milestones - but they\u2019re all different. But personally, I think a lot of the modern changes that made a huge impact came about in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s - with people like Elvis making music into a global sensation, and Queen (popularising dancing on stage AND creating the first music PV rather than just a live recording).

But since I don\u2019t like some of the changes that happened during the second half, I won\u2019t vote the entire century. The 1800/1840 period includes Beethoven\u2019s 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th Symphonies, Berlioz\u2019 Symphonie Fantastique, Harold in Italy, Les Nuits d\u2019Ete and Requiem, and Schubert\u2019s entire life!
