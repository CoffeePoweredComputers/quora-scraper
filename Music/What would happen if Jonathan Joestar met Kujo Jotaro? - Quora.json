            "answer_text": "I think Jonathan would see past Jotaro's cold exterior and see the good man underneath. Consider Jonathan's best friend, Speedwagon. When he and Jonathan first met, Speedwagon attacked Jonathan with his bladed hat, intending to mortally wound him, but Jonathon held back his attack. When asked why, Jonathan replied that he was desperate enough to save his father to visit Ogre Street, so he would not risk hurting someone else who might have just been fending for his family. Thus began the most sincere friendship Jonathan had in his life. If Jonathan were to meet Jotaro, he may at first find the young man's demeanor boorish, but once he learns that Jotaro's apathy is a facade and he does love his mother, he would likely warm up to the boy. After all, Jotaro's goal was not all that different than Jonathon's, defeating Dio to save the life of a parent, and Jonathan would see Jotaro as virtuous and heroic despite their differences in personality. Of course, if you want the \"canonical\" answer (as far as Eyes of Heaven is canon), mostly Jonathan just doesn't know what's going on at any time.  ",

            "answer_text": "Jonathan would probably think very poorly of him, at least in the beginning. It is established early on in Part 3 that Jotaro is a punk. Calling his own mom a bitch, not paying for meals at restaurants, and regularly getting into fights at school solidified his reputation as a delinquent. Even his grandpa Joseph, who Speedwagon noted had none of the gentleman-liness of Jonathan, was appalled at his behavior. Jonathan is an old fashioned man of virtue. He would be shocked at the disrespect that Jotaro consistently puts out. However, if they had to face a common enemy, I believe Jonathan would come to respect his cool-headedness and effectiveness in combat. ",
