            "answer_text": "It isn\u2019t illegal to sing a copyrighted song but it is illegal to record and then put it out for public consumption. It is also illegal to sing SOME copyrighted songs if you are in a band and performing in a bar or club or any other venue you are getting paid to play in. I thought it was important to clarify that part because if you are playing at a party and not getting paid it would be hard to charge you with a crime by performing it since your are not profiting for playing. When I was in a band there was a list of songs we were not allowed to play unless we paid a fee but there were tons of songs that were copyrighted that we could so it depends on the song. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s illegal to perform a copyrighted song in a public venue, unless you have permission to do so. In the case of public performance venues in the US, it\u2019s the venue\u2019s responsibility to get permission and pay the royalties. If, say, you\u2019re going to record it for distribution, then you have to get the permission and pay the license fee. ",
