            "answer_text": " Enigma (musical project), Michael Cretu\u2019s pet project, even after a quarter of a century continues to enthrall music lovers the world over. A significant musical journey which has constantly evolved over the years, Cretu and his team continue to explore boundaries merging New-Age and Ambient sounds into new musical stories. And its only obvious someone will want to explore artists with similar musical styles and I personally use The Tourist Map of Music for the same. The closeness in names means similarity in musical styles/ genres and thus higher probability to like the other, if you like the first one. So this is what it throws up:  From amongst these, whom I can personally vouch for are the following: Deep Forest - Wikipedia (ethnic electronica + chill-wave) Diane and David Arkenstone (Celtic/ Native American/ New-Wave) Gregorian (band) (Gregorian chants fused into modern-wave) (the song below is a cover but still\u2026) Enya (perhaps most commercially and critically successful of this lot) Secret Garden (European Instrumental) Era (musical project) (similar to \u201cGregorian\u201d mixing new-age/ Indietronica with chants) Amethystium (ambient New-Age tronica) BLUE-STONE.CC (Vocal Ambient Electronica) Other than these, the map is also throwing up 2 of my other favorites Moby and The Cranberries :: Something Else, though I am not sure why (maybe because of European influence/ Ambient Electronica/ Beats) but you can try them out (who ever needed a reason to check out new music anyways!!!) HAPPY LISTENING\u2026(& let us know if any of these work for you) ",
