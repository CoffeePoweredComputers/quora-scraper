            "answer_text": "I had to google Ukelele Ike because I didn\u2019t know who that was - and then realized I had heard him before but didn\u2019t know his name. I would say that I have a reasonable general knowledge of music and musicians so I would file him in the \u2018slightly obscure\u2019 category. It takes a certain kind of fan with the time to, desire to, and sufficient skill to chart out the chords to songs, and I would guess because he is partially obscure there isn\u2019t really anybody interested enough to do that\u2026and if there is they may not be posting them to the internet for several different reasons (just for personal use, they think no one else is interested, etc) ",
