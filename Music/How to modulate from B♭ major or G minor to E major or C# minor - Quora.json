            "answer_text": "Usually, the best way to get from one key to another is to find your way to the dominant (chord based on the fifth scale degree) of the NEW key. BUT, the modulations you are talking about are easy, because you are modulating to the relative minor key. That means that the two keys share all the same notes \u2014 for example, Bb major has the following notes: Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, A, and Bb. G minor has the same notes, but starting on G instead: G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F, and G. Because the two keys share all the same notes and the only thing that is different is the note you start on, modulating between the two is effortless. A Bb chord has a Bb in it (the root, or bottom note), and a g minor chord also has a Bb in it (the third, or middle note). Because the two chords share a common note, you can go directly from Bb to g minor, and it will sound fine. The same is true for E major to C# minor \u2014 they are related keys. By the way, the relative minor key (the one that has all the same notes) is ALWAYS a minor third down from the major key. So the relative minor of Eb major would be c minor, for example. ",
