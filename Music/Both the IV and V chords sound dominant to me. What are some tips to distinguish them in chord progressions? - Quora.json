            "answer_text": "I know the problem. I had it too. I\u2019m going to assume that you know the difference between the IV and the V as was also the case with me. I studied music theory and although I knew all of the pertinent theory behind these chords and plenty more I often seemed to not hear when a dominant chord was dominant and I mixed them up with Sub-Dominant chords. Needless to say this was embarrassing! This wasn\u2019t to do with a lack of understanding with what these chords were and what function they played. This was less the case when the Dominant chord was diminished or at least had a b9. The closer a dominant chord got to a diminished vii chord the easier it got. Nonetheless, the dominant triad was sometimes mixed up in my hearing with the IV triad. My solution came with practice of playing what I hear by ear. Ie. listening to pop songs or film music (not so much \u2018normal\u2019 classical music or even modern classical music and also not so much jazz) and playing back what I heard and comparing. For me the solution was just in practice - trial and error. Eventually I started to hear the falling fifth (or rising fourth) of the root for the IV and the rising fifth (or falling fourth) for the V chord. I talked about my difficulty in hearing the difference with my professor at the time and he wasn\u2019t really able to give me much help - I found that the difficulty wasn\u2019t a matter of missing understanding, but rather just one of missing practice. I hear \u2018absolute\u2019. Ie if you play a note on the piano or any instrument for that matter I can tell you directly what it is (granted my accuracy with the voice is sometimes more like 90% - also, this only works 70% of the time the other way around, ie when I have to deliver a \u2018C\u2019 from my own voice). So maybe I only hear \u2018kind-of-absolute\u2019. The relevance of this is that you might also hear absolute. I find/have found, that some absolute listeners are sometimes somewhat crippled by their absolute hearing. This was definitely the case with me and it is still an issue sometimes. Sometimes they completely forgo their ability to hear \u2018relative\u2019 (ie. to hear the relationships between chords). Instead, single tones are heard and their relationships are ignored. If you hear absolute it\u2019s important to do your best to forbid yourself of listening to the individual tones of the chord and force yourself to try and listen to the chord as a whole and it\u2019s relationship to the neighbouring chords. It is possible with practice. Hearing \u2018relative\u2019 needs to be practiced and developed. If you had not been doing this yet, or just to a minimal degree then you have some catching up to do (as did I). I suggest doing simple \u2018listen\u2019 and \u2018play-what-you-hear\u2019 for many songs. Simple is always good and pop music is quite helpful here. Pop will have a lot of IV and V - granted there will also be plenty of iii and vi - but hey, c\u2019est la vie! Do NOT use lead sheet or chord charts. I assume you know all of your 12 major and 12 minor chords, if not learn them. With the guitar you can do this with a handful of Barre chords. If you want have a look here: How do guitar players play the same chord up and down the guitar (I\u2019m coming from a piano background)? You can also alternatively use a capo, but I\u2019d recommend learning how to get around the aforementioned 24 chords without a capo as well. Start with some Bronze Radio Return (Further On), Coldplay (there are occasional modulations [generally the relative minor], but they are nonetheless pretty overwhelmingly I IV V dependent, endeavour to always know where the tonic is), Ed Sheeran, Family of the Year (Hero), Ivan & Alyosha, Nick Drake, Oasis, Radical Face, Tom Petty, Awol Nation. Also I suspect U2, Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, Randy Newman, and Tom Waits might be good. Essentially anything which is going to be I, IV, V dependent - or \u2018to a large degree dependent\u2019. This is one of those things in life where \u2018more is more\u2019 - the more you play things back by ear WITHOUT using any lead sheets or similar the better. More is more. At the beginning you will be fighting your way though each song, but after some practice you\u2019ll start hearing: oh..I think that sounds like that other dominant, or sub-dominant. You\u2019ll start hearing their relationships. Oh, one more thing. Play a tritone and listen to it. Dissonant right? It is not stable, it has a ratio of 45:32. If you\u2019re talking about recognising Dominant chords which have a 3rd and a 7th then you\u2019ll have this tritone. This is a good element to listen for which is not present in the Sub-Dominant.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s interesting how both IV and V can feel strongly as if they are leading back to I, and, that may be what you are feeling. Or, perhaps, you are thinking not of IV but of II6/5, which in C major is an F (IV) chord with a D added on the top. A II6/5 functions very much like a V, and is used that way in a lot of music. If one adds a G in the bass to the II6/5, one has a G7sus. People seem to vary in how they rationalize the phenomenon of dominance and tonality. My ear is probably not good enough to \u201cthink\u201d in terms of scales that way. I do believe my ear \u201cfeels\u201d two basic movements: V to I, outlined by the fifth in the base and the second (or third) in the upper voice; and, IV to I. In both cases, I \u201cfeel\u201d the tonal motion downward (although the leading voice may move upward). They are two variations of a kind of coming to rest, in my mind. The V to I movement is somewhat more \u201cfinal\u201d in my mind, because, it doesn\u2019t suggest anywhere else to go thereafter, perhaps (but, this is pure speculation on my part and not particularly thought through) it contains no descending half-step. The IV to I movement, on the other hand, has a noticeable, descending half-step from four to three. There\u2019s a suggestion, in my mind at least, that the three might become the leading tone to the fourth, for example\u2014that tonality is modulating to the IV as a new I. There\u2019s another possibility about descending half-steps\u2014they can function (especially in minor keys) to define a new, artificial (?) V on their destination. Typical case, perhaps: F to C, then E7 (B in the bass), then A-minor. The V-to-I movement doesn\u2019t have either of these ambiguities, at least as I hear them. ",

What are some tips to distinguish them in chord progressions?\u2019 I actually don\u2019t know what you are saying with this question, the IV & V chords can be easily distinguished by listening to them, and hearing them. A IV chord is 2 tones + one semitone away from the I chord, the V chord is two tones + one semitone + one tone away from the I chord. You can distinguish them from the number of intervals they are away from the home chord, the number of tones they are from the home chord. If we accept the I chord as being the \u2018key\u2019 then we count the intervals in that home key\u2019s scale. I think it is important to focus on music in terms of how it sounds. I can always hear if a IVth or Vth interval is being used, your ear becomes accustomed to the intervals. ",

So, (as long as you\u2019re certain it\u2019s either either a IV or V chord) if you can sing the tonic with the chord, then it\u2019s a IV chord.

The IV chord contains a b5 tone as a non-chord tone (tension) which can embellish the IV chord but lacks the dominant tri-tone punch. The IV chord resolves into the V chord and the V chord can stand alone or resolve into the I chord. The II chord and IV chords are both subdominant chords. They can be interchangeable at will. This where the II/V/I and the IV/V/I chord progressions are similar in cadence. The combination of the major 3rd and b7 tones (the tri-tone interval) produces the dominant chord sound. In the jazz minor scale, the IV chord contains a b7 tone as opposed to the major scale\u2019s major 7th tone (labeled as a Lydian b7 chord). This could be a characteristic of the composer\u2019s intent as to what scale type is being used or if the chord is \u201cborrowed\u201d from a different scale for effect. Good question.
