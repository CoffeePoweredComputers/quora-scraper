            "answer_text": "Truth be told, when comparing music streaming services, you start by comparing the unique artists only available on specific services. If both have artists you want to listen to, the next thing would be to compare pricing (if applicable) and features. That being said Deezer has a library from over 180 countries, while Spotify only has 58. So if you're looking for music from a particular country, Deezer may be a better option in most markets. If it just so happens that both services have the artists you want to listen to, then you go to the next step, price. Both have similar pricing plans, except Deeser offers high quality streaming that I believe is of higher quality than Spotify's. But you're going to pay extra for this optional higher quality music from Deezer. Though Deezer has higher quality music, Spotify has more features at the moment. So now you're stuck asking yourself do you even need/want the extra features that Spotify offers, or would you rather the optional higher quality media, or are the two even high on the totem pole for you. In the end, this comes down to a what specifically do you desire battle, and the exact answer will vary from person to person. There honestly is no wrong answer as long as you find the material you like on the service of your choice. ",

            "answer_text": "In general and with content Spotify. I hate one program dominant in the game but nothing beats Spotify. It has the biggest library even tho it doesn't pay anywhere near enough to the artist. It has the most users, it has specials just for Spotify, which other music programs do but every has it and it's just so much easier. Im an android user though so it's even easier for me. People with iPhones say it links in with the music app well but im sticking with Spotify, the first big time program, the best. ",
