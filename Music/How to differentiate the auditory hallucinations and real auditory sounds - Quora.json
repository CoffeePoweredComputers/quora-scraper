            "answer_text": "You could ask for a second opinion. If the sound is hallucinatory, it is unlikely that another person can hear it. This you may regard as not real. If another person can hear the sound, this you may regard as real. If there is no-one to hand whom you may consult, you could use your other senses and critical thinking skills to deduce whether the sound is hallucinatory or real. For example, if you hear the sound of bats and it is daylight in the city, it is unlikely that the sound is real and it is probably safe to act as if the sound is not real. If you hear the sound of a bus in a street where busses commonly travel, eyesight may suffice to verify its existence or its lack of existence. If you remain unsure, for any reason, relax and the sound will pass, sooner or later. Sounds are impermanent. The sound will vanish and so will the necessity of ascertaining whether it is real or not real. ",

The problem is explaining where the false voices come from. Are they real? Is it a form of psychic communication? Aliens? God? Or maybe its normal to hear voices and everybody is pretending that they don't, it's just you stupid, who doesn't understand how life works. See, that's the problem. The voices still don't go away, even if you know they aren't \u2018real\u2019 and you're left trying to figure out why they're talking to you. But the truth is that it is a malfunction of the brain. Once a voice-hearer understands and accepts that they usually feel better. It is a treatable condition and can be made better by anti-psychotic medication. ",

            "answer_text": "The best way is to ask another person. If you hear something and they don\u2019t, then there is a problem. One time is ok, and if the sound is vague and stops shortly then it\u2019s just a discrepancy in auditory perception. But if that happens many times, then there is hallucination. Pay attention to the nature of it as well. If it is a repeating voice with negative message, chances are it is hallucination. If you cannot stop hearing it by moving to a totally different location, then there is hallucination. ",
