            "answer_text": "Yes, he did. Donald Trump first met Michael Jackson at a concert at New York city\u2019s Madisson Square Garden in March 1988. They became more properly acquainted in 1990, when Donald Trump opened his Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic city, New Jersey, the most expensive casino ever built. In April 1990, Michael Jackson attended the grand opening and as it was expected his arrival caused pandemonium. There were thousands of screaming fans and dozens of photographers that Donald Trump got real frightened, even with 20 bodyguards around. Michael who was accustomed to such chaos in his presence dropped down on his knees and started crawling to the exit. Trump asked Michael: \u2018\u2019Michael is it always like that?\u2019\u2019 and he replied \u2018\u2019oh yeah, this is nothing. Japan is much worse. The next day, Michael left for Indianapolis to be at his friend\u2019s Ryan White\u2019s bedside, who was losing his five year battle with AIDS. Ryan White was a hemophiliac who became infected with AIDS from a contaminated blood treatment and he was expelled from school because of his infection. He was diagnosed with HIV in 1984. Michael Jackson befriended Ryan and publicly helped destigmatize socializing with people with AIDS. Ryan White died in April 1990. Donald Trump accompanied Michael to the White family home in Indianapolis, seemingly sensing a golden public relations opportunity, when Michael heard Ryan had passed. It is said however that Trump paid for Ryan\u2019s medical expenses. Michael was grief stricken by Ryan\u2019s loss and dedicated his song Gone too soon to him. Michael also dedicated this song to Lady Diana during a concert in France in 1997, when she was killed in a car crash.Late Ryan White\u2019s mother always spoke highly of Michael and she said that Michael took pride in the fact that Ryan listened to his song \u2018\u2019the man in the mirror\u2019\u2019 before he died. RIP Michael and Ryan.  ",

He would probably be living overseas in Europe or Ireland because he was getting disgusted with the USA!! Trump sucks and Michael would agree with me!! ",
