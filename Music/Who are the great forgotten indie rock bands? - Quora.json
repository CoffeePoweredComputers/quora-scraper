            "answer_text": "Thelonious Monster, an unpredictable LA band that moved in Red Hot Chili Peppers/Jane's Addiction circles in the 1980s, wrote great songs and made raucous, all-over-the-place records but fell apart because lead singer Bob Forrest couldn't stop taking drugs. Their song Sammy Hagar Weekend is classic but a novelty; most of their song were conversational rants about being downtrodden, pissed off, fucked up, etc.  The Plimsouls had a hit with A Million Miles Away -- which they performed in the Nicholas Cage film Valley Girl -- but mostly operated on the fringes of the LA rock scene in the 1980s. Along with bands like X, The Blasters, Los Lobos, and another important one I'm not thinking of, they were stuck somewhere between hardcore and Paisley Underground and never achieved mainstream success. Peter Case, of course, was the first rock guy to unplug -- this is before the MTV Unplugged era -- and is known in songwriting circles as one of the greats. American Music Club may never have been discovered. A San Francisco band from the early-mid 1990s, they made textured, melodic, highly-original art out of Mark Eitzel's downcast and self-conscious but also funny songs. Vudi, guitarist and backbone of the band, was last seen driving a bus in LA. ",

Listen. Just listen: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvbGXMnPJWM Red House Painters - Mark Kozelek continues to make great music -- both as a solo artist and with Sun Kil Moon -- but nothing compares to his work with RHP. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpYne2su3XM Creeper Lagoon - San Francisco outfit that never gets its due. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=327g0w9x77s I'll also echo Swervedriver from Lance's list: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHva52tOoeo ",
