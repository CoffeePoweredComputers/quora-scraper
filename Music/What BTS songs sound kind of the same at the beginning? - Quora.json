            "answer_text": "Save Me and I\u2019m Fine are songs that sound the similar at the beginning, but that\u2019s because they are basically the same. Save Me, off of The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Young Forever album, is a cry out for help, with more somber lyrics such as \u201cWhy is it so dark where you\u2019re not here / It\u2019s dangerous how wrecked I am / Save me because I can\u2019t get a grip on myself\u201d. I\u2019m Fine, off of BTS\u2019s most recent release Love Yourself: Answer, puts a literal twist on this theme, and the producer/rap line even decided to use samples from Save Me\u2019s actual intro in I\u2019m Fine\u2019s intro. Throughout the song, the lyrics show direct contrast to Save Me\u2019s, such as \u201cGive me your hand / save me, save me\u201d in Save Me, and \u201cI\u2019ll let go of your hand now\u201d in I\u2019m Fine. I\u2019m Fine displays the triumph that BTS has won over their own personal struggles, in which they felt as if they needed someone else to Save Them from. ",
