            "answer_text": "Answer most probably lies inside our brain. The hallucination of scary and dark figures are mainly attributed to three factors - Parietal lobe disturbance - Several papers suggest that functional disturbance of the right parietal cortex explains the shadowy nocturnal bedroom intruder hallucination during SP. This hallucination may arise due to a disturbance in the multi-sensory processing of body and self at the temporo-parietal junction. This is the same place where the sensation from body comes, creating a conscious body image morphology. [1] Mirror neurons - Few researchers are speculating the role of mirror neurons (significant for empathy and out of body experiences) in these types of hallucination. The disturbance in these circuits might be playing some role in it. [2] Threat hyper-vigilance - The sense of presence of Intruder, consisting of sensed presence, fear, and auditory and visual hallucinations, is conjectured to originate in a hypervigilant state initiated in the midbrain. More specifically, the emergency response is activated in the brain when individuals wake up paralyzed and feel vulnerable to attack.This helplessness can intensify the effects of the threat response well above the level typical of normal dreams, which could explain why such visions during sleep paralysis are so vivid.[3][4] Now, the question arises, why do these disturbances happen during sleep paralysis? Normally dreams (including nightmares) occur during REM stage of sleep (which also causes sleep paralysis), therefore, dreams of REM sleep (REM mentation) can spill over into emerging wakefulness.

            "answer_text": "So this is the simple scientifically accurate explanation, but explained so that people who don\u2019t have a deep or intensive understanding of the human brain can comprehend. When you sleep, you go through 3 stages of sleep and then REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. REM is basically when you\u2019re dreaming. Now, during this stage, your brain basically shuts down all signals to voluntary muscles; this is to keep you from acting out your dreams. Basically, your body is paralysed when you\u2019re asleep and dreaming, and as soon as you exit the dream (REM) stage of sleep, this paralysis goes away instantly, seamlessly, when you wake up. In sleep paralysis, what happens is that either during the process of falling asleep or waking up, the brain jumbles up the transition between wakefulness to dreaming (or vice versa) for reasons we do not fully understand. When this happens, features of sleep overlap with the conscious world, and one of them is sleep paralysis. You wind up awake, conscious, somewhat still dreaming, and paralysed. Apart from eyelids (to some extent) and extremities, you can\u2019t move anything, and taking \u2018deep\u2019 breaths is impossible. Obviously, this is bloody scary, when you can\u2019t move a single muscle no matter how hard you try, and your brain goes into panic mode and starts releasing all kinds of hormones that it releases in a panic situation, such as adrenaline. And to top this all off, you\u2019re still kind of dreaming while awake. What happens then is that the fear of experiencing physical paralysis + the hormonal cocktail in your brain + still being semi-dreaming, these together result in your brain mapping your dream imagery into the dream world. it\u2019s hard to explain, super realistic, because you\u2019re half awake and well aware of your surroundings! Your brain\u2019s response to panic and the fact that you\u2019re still half dreaming causes you to fill in the blanks and assume that there is some reason you are unable to move and this manifests itself in the form of some being that appears in front of you. It\u2019s a mind trick. That\u2019s why it\u2019s always something creepy or scary or life threatening, whether it\u2019s a demon, evil spirits, etc. For example, if experience sleep paralysis while waking up in a bedroom, you can see everything around you, so the process of dreaming while awake and while being completely scared results in \u201cseeing\u201d demons, malevolent beings, or basically some sort of intrinsically negative, supernatural vision. This vision is extremely realistic, and when you wake up properly, if sleep paralysis is unfamiliar to you, you will not know if it was real or not, and will usually think that it was, because you saw it with your eyes. This often results in people who experience sleep paralysis having some ridiculous supernatural stories to tell. bottom line, Sleep paralysis leaves you conscious, fully awake, fully capable of absorbing the surroundings, and - most importantly - paralysed. being consciously paralysed is a scary thing, whatever you may say, when it hits you for the first time, or even second time, or any time if it\u2019s not a regular occurrence for you. you\u2019re literally jerked awake out of sleep and try to move your body and it doesn\u2019t move. This is extremely scary when experienced. ",
