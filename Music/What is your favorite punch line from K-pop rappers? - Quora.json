ATEEZ's Mingi\u2019s \u2018Fix On\u2019 before most of his rap verses. In their song, \u2018Wonderland\u2019, you can hear it after the first chorus, at the start of the second verse.  I.M\u2019s \u2018I.M what I am\u2019 before his verse in \u2018Shootout\u2019. Also Joohoney\u2019s \u2018Joohunnit One Hunnit\u2019.  Joohoney\u2019s \u2018Baby, Who the X? I'm a X\u2019 in \u2018Jealousy\u2019.  NCT 127\u2019s Mark\u2019s \u2018Long ass ride\u2019. He's used it a few times, but I've only heard it in Whiplash. (I haven't heard that many of their songs).  JBJ95\u2019s Sanggyun\u2019s \u2018Swerve, baby\u2019 before majority of his rap verses. He used it a lot in his JBJ days and continues to use it now in JBJ95. (Descriptions are under videos.) ",
