            "answer_text": "Hello! I copied and pasted your question into Google, and received this answer Remembering George Michael: An Artist and a Rock Star. For those who don't want to actually read the article on the other side of the link ( me being one one of them on most days) , the answer is YES! George Michael was a very talented musician, and did most of the instrumentation on a great deal of his albums. Personally, just by listening and being a fan of him over the years, I've been able to tell that he is adept at playing the guitar. I hope this helps! ",
