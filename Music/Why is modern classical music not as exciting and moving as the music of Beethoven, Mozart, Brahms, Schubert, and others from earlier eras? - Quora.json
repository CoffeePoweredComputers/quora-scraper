            "answer_text": "Although you are entitled to your opinion, let me try to give some reasoning to why you should give Modernist music a chance. The impetus for modern music began with works of Strauss, Wagner, Mahler, and Debussy. The deliberate pushing of form to its limits, the movement from strict tonality to a more fluid (eventual) atonality, and an overarching theme of innovation. When Schoenberg eventually created serialism, and 12-tone compositions, he showed that music can be made without following any set tonal rules. However, he exemplified not that tonality should be thrown out the window, but that music could still (in his mind) thrive without \u2018invisible rules\u2019 guiding it. Look, I\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t go around listening to Schoenberg\u2019s Piano Sonatas and his chamber works casually. But just because music is not aurally pleasing to me or you, does not mean that it isn't interesting or emotionally moving to the composer and to other listeners. This especially applies to Schoenberg; I respect his methods and his innovative desire, but it\u2019ll just take some time before any of his music will really click for me. If you are interested in giving him a chance, some of his output, like his Violin Concerto and Transfigured Night are less \u2018harsh\u2019 to the ear. Also, not all 20th century music was serialistic. Here are a few composers off of the top of my head that took influence from Schoenberg and the Second Viennese School but did not totally turn serial: Bartok, Walton, Reger, Britten, Barber, Stravinsky, Gershwin, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, and Hindemith. Give these guys a listen. There is a significant difference in \u2018sound\u2019 between their compositions and the compositions of the Romantic era, but the idiosyncrasy of their output is what comprises its beauty. For example, Bartok. Bartok was a fiercely nationalistic composer. His works are covered in classic Hungarian folk melodies, \u2018gypsy\u2019 themes, and a totally different sort of percussive style of rhythm. His music is deeply emotional; my favorite work of his (one I like to flaunt because I am a violist), is his Viola Concerto:  It is a work filled with pathos; written after WWII, it is his aria to his country and his hate of how war ruined it. His apprentice, Tibor Serly, had to put it together on his deathbed. Is there not something incredibly moving about a composer writing a work on his deathbed? The passion that Modern composers had for their music was equivalent, if not more fiery, than the passion that Classical and Romantic composers have. This, like all art, imbues their creations with immense value. For another example, lets take Samuel Barber. Barber was an american composer who lived in the 20th century who wrote the emotional Adagio for Strings:  And, just for kicks, here are a few more examples by Prokofiev and Shostakovich, respectively:   Give those works a thorough listen and come back to the Modernist movement as a whole. The music is exciting, it is moving. Just give it a chance and never stop keeping your ears open! ",

            "answer_text": "Answers here so far draw from a historical perspective. I will instead try to draw from a psychological perspective why the music of past eras may seem more \u2018moving\u2019 than modern classical music. When sound waves enter your ear, they travel along what is called the \u2018Basilar Membrane\u2019 in the inner ear. Basically, it\u2019s a strange curled-up thing which converts sounds into electrical impulses to send to the brain. It does this by pushing little hairs against a surface.  The ear. Hope you\u2019re taking notes because there\u2019s a short quiz at the end of this semester. If you stretch out the basilar membrane, it\u2019s a bit like a piano - hairs on one side represent low notes, and as you go along it the hairs represent higher notes. So when you hear a low pitch sound, the hairs nearer the \u2018base\u2019 are pushed up, and when you hear a high pitch sound, the hairs nearer the \u2018apex\u2019 are pushed up. Same as how the notes on the left side of the piano are all low pitches, and the notes on the right side are all high pitches.   See? Pretty much the same, except one requires a biology degree and the other a music degree to understand. If you play two notes on a piano, you have to press two keys. Same with the basilar membrane - if you hear two notes, it pushes two sets of hairs. The brain is therefore receiving two sets of electrical impulses telling it what notes it is hearing. Because the way these notes will overlap along the basilar membrane, things can get complicated. For this reason, the brain prefers some certain mathematical ratios between the notes it hears. In particular, it likes to hear the intervals of a 4th, 5th, or octave (so in C major, it likes to hear a C played with an F, G, or C). In the realm of physics-psychology, this is consonance. Meanwhile, notes which share a mathematical relationship the brain does not like are called dissonance. The brain doesn\u2019t like dissonant intervals because the maths between the intervals increases the amount of information the brain has to deal with, or \u2018cognitive load\u2019. The brain likes consonant intervals because it reduces the amount of cognitive load - the brain feels chilled when it hears consonance. More specifically, it feels super chilled when it hears dissonance followed by consonance, it is like a \u2018relief\u2019 from the stress.  Sorry, but I just had to\u2026 Cognitive load actually is responsible for a lot of what the brain is universally capable of doing or not. In 1957, the psychologist George A. Miller discovered that the brain can only process 7 \u2018bits\u2019 of information (+2 or -2) in a given short time, so 5\u20139 \u2018bits\u2019 in a short time. This explains well why most musical modes (the scales we use to play music) across the world usually have 5\u20139 notes. The brain likes scales based around 5\u20139 notes because the cognitive load is manageable. Because these scales have a good \u2018cognitive load\u2019, we tend to repeat playing them. As we repeat them, we share them together. Eventually, everyone around you is playing the same mode. Because everyone is playing using the same basic idea, we can use it as a way to communicate. Through communication, we can start sharing emotion. Before you know it, the scale we chose at the beginning becomes a cultural phenomenon, such as the Western Major or Minor scale:   But then one day, you hear something you\u2019re not used to. You listen to it, and you hear its root is \u2018D\u2019, but it includes an \u2018Eb\u2019 and no F or C. Your brain feels panicked, it doesn\u2019t know what to do with this! That\u2019s not a D major or a D minor!! In fact, it\u2019s this:  A Japanese \u2018Miyako-Bushi\u2019 scale. At first, it sounds cold and different. Maybe because people aren\u2019t used to it, they think it is \u2018inferior\u2019. But after listening to it a few times, maybe those people start to \u2018get used to it\u2019, they feel it is ok after all, and they start hearing emotion in music that uses it. That\u2019s because eventually the brain, through repeated listening, starts to reduce the cognitive load - it begins to recognise the pattern and can start working with it. Before long, it can process it the same as the Western major and minor scales it\u2019s used to, and find emotion and meaning in it. So let\u2019s recap - on a basic physical level, the basilar membrane has a clear distinction between consonance and dissonance. To maintain a balanced cognitive load, this means we pick scales with 5\u20139 notes. With time, these notes become part of the culture and we can use them to communicate meaning and emotion. So what has any of this got to do with experimental modern classical music??? Everything! It\u2019s wrong to generalize about modern classical music, but modern classical composers almost take it as a truth that they must write something challenging. The problem with challenging, is it then fights against the physical, psychological and cultural barriers I\u2019ve written about above. Let\u2019s use 12-tone music, or serialism as an example - I use this because it\u2019s what really started the whole experimental phase off. On the physical level, having semitones consistently bash against each other in a piece of music creates strong amounts of dissonance within the basilar membrane. On the psychological level, using 12 tones as the basic unit of composition strongly goes against the regular accepted cognitive load of 5\u20139 notes. On the cultural level, getting other people to start enjoying serial music and communicating emotional meaning through it is hard when everybody is already enjoying and sharing emotion through the lighter cognitive load of the major and minor scales. Also, because of these barriers, serialism has given itself one extra barrier that makes it harder for people to enjoy: elitism.  \u201cI heard an excellent example of post-Stockhausenesque micropolyphonal tone clusters which expanded from its Webernian-like fixture into a rather spectralist kaleidoscope of texture, at once embracing yet denying its sonic materaliaty\u201d Serialism, and the experimental craze it set off that continues today by extension, takes time and effort due to its psychoacoustical, psychological, and cultural barriers. The people who have put in the effort and feel they \u2018get\u2019 something from it therefore can assume they have some more enlightened way of listening compared to the \u2018untrained masses\u2019. But really, all they\u2019ve done is gotten used to a different class of pitch hierarchy. Nonetheless, it was that rejection of the past and affirmation of those who \u2018got it\u2019 that modern classical music was founded upon.  But despite the pretensions, the elitists really want everyone to like them anyway. Deep down, they want others to enjoy their experiments too. In addition to the quote above, Schoenberg also predicted that milkmen would one day be whistling 12-tone rows. So let\u2019s finally answer the question: Why is modern classical music not as exciting and moving as the music of Beethoven, Mozart, Brahms, Schubert, and others from earlier eras? The basic answer is because most modern classical music is built upon an idea that it must always be challenging the game, which is basically to put a heavy cognitive load on our physical software, our psychological perceptions, and our cultural practices. Because these levels aren\u2019t so easily established, the \u2018meaning\u2019 and \u2018emotion\u2019 of the music is harder to explore and share, and remains locked in to a close community which takes an elitist approach to its ownership. That elitism ensures the close-knit circle really gets into its communicative and emotional capacity, but also kind of closes off people on the outside to really get past those initial physical and psychological hurdles. Interestingly, the modern classical music that has done most well is that from the minimalist or jazz strain, because they continue to use foundations that conform with the expected cognitive load and psychological perceptions our brains are used to. How to deal with this then? Basically, you either keep listening to try to train your brain to get used to it, and you start communicating within the tight-knit group to see what they\u2019re hearing that you\u2019re missing. Through that, your brain will familiarise itself with it, know what to listen for, and begin to use the music as a source of communication and emotion. The other route is to not bother and just continue to look for music that you like. Whilst elitists will reject you as a \u2018populist conformist\u2019, the feat of getting used to experimental music, psychoacoustically speaking, is not that great a deal. Even if you know experimental music, you\u2019re still losing out on a world of emotion and exploration in the music of India, East Asia, South-East Asia, Africa etc. Basically all the music styles you still haven\u2019t trained for. In that sense, you pick the styles you want to explore, you want to get to know, and you get into them. Have fun! ",
