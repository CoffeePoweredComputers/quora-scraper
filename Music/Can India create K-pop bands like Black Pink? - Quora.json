            "answer_text": "If you're asking whether INDIA can create a Girl band or not. Then my answer will be Yes. Why not? But then again their should be a company that is ready to invest so much money and should be ready to train the members. Since Indian Audience isn't much into bands (as such) I don't think any company will invest money all of a sudden to create a band. Music Market is money oriented. Companies don't tend to work on something outta blue. They don't like to take risk in order to create something, unless and until they are confident enough that it will most probably work out. So I'll sum up my answer by saying INDIA CAN CREATE BANDS BUT THE QUESTION IS WHO WILL INVEST SO MUCH MONEY TO CREATE SOMETHING LIKE THIS. ",

Even if they wanted to make bands like that a lot of preparation has to be done before hand and it may takes years but they can definitely do it if they WANT TO ",
