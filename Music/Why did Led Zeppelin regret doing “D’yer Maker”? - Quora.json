            "answer_text": "I wasn\u2019t aware that they did regret it. I looked up the song on Wikipedia and it seems John Paul Jones was not a fan of the song but Robert Plant wanted to release it as a single, though it wasn\u2019t released as one in the UK. I remember seeing an interview of Axl Rose on MTV in which he mentioned hearing the song on the radio. He pronounced it as it was meant to be pronounced, as \u201cJamaica\u201d. This was before I knew about the joke behind the song title (I thought the song was pronounced \u201cDire Maker\u201d), so I wondered what song he was talking about. Anyway, Rose said he initially thought of the song as a joke but shortly after started scanning the radio to find it again. He credits the song for getting him into hard rock. ",

            "answer_text": "Because it\u2019s garbage, a filler track. It happened because the band was listening to reggae and were teasing John Bonham about his inability to play in reggae time. Then someone told an ancient British slapstick joke: Punter 1: Took t\u2019 missus on holiday to the Caribbean last week. Punter 2: Jamaica? Punter 1: Nah, she wanted to go. And the lyrics were born. Truly bad. And it sounds awful, not reggae at all. It may be one of the worst tracks in their collection. In addition, American FM fell in love with the damn thing, and plays it to this day, so their embarrassment is in front of them at all times. What irony that one of the greatest bands of all time ends up with an awful track on heavy rotation for eternity. ",
