            "answer_text": "While the question is way too subjective. It can also depend over what is it that you prefer: Led Zeppelin or Pink Floyd? Sex Pistols or Queen? (to give an example of) Of course, you might like both ends of this pseudo-spectrum but what is it that you'd rate over the other. I'm naming some of the most amazing albums according to me which have also received widespread critical acclaim. Classic Rock:(sorry for the cliched term) Revolver by The Beatles  Basic Info:It was kind of like before this album, the Beatles were a bunch of pop boys. But on getting amazing success they decided to experiment and open up a bit. The album also got a different reception from earlier Beatles albums. The band felt free to \"branch out\" into new themes and ideas, that nobody had tried in a pop music recording before.  Taxman commented on the tax system in England. Eleanor Rigby was about loneliness. A few of the songs made references to drugs, particularly John Lennon's songs. She Said She Said was about a party in Los Angeles the Beatles had gone to, and had taken LSD. Doctor Robert was about a New York doctor (Charles Roberts) who overprescribed sedatives and \"feel-good\" drugs for his patients. Tomorrow Never Knows came from Lennon's reading The Psychedelic Experience, which adapted the Tibetan Book of the Dead as a drug-user's guide. Beatles lead guitarist George Harrison was happy to have three of his own songs included on Revolver, \"Taxman\", \"Love You To\", and \"I Want to Tell You\". Most Beatles albums only had one or two Harrison songs. \"Love You To\" did not feature guitars, but Harrison instead played a sitar. World-famous sitarist Ravi Shankar heard the song, but did not like it, and offered to teach Harrison to play sitar properly. Shankar and Harrison went on to become lifelong friends. Why?: This album came before all the other big revolutions in Rock music. Just around the psychedelic explosion and before the return to roots, progressive and Heavy Metal. Cream has onyl released their first album, Jimmy Hendrix still hadn't appeared for his legendary Monterey Pop festival.  These songs don't have immense lyrical depth but are revolutionary in music arrangements, song structures and awesome (at least for their times before all the big 60s music biggies). Modern Rock Loveless by My Bloody Valentine   Basic Info:Not commercially successful the first time it was released but has since been hailed as one of the best 90s albums. Basically, if we wish to dumb it down there's a wall of noise created behind a simple pop song structure. The album is also amazing in giving the same importance in vocals as to any other part of the song arrangement, making them difficult to understand and creating this trance kind of effect., Kevin Shields, the lead guitarist of the band wavers his guitar's tremolo bar (wammy bar) as he strums, which creates this amazing distinctive sound. He calls this technique Glide guitar, which causes the string to bend in and out of tune. Shields said that due to his use of the tremolo bar,  \"People were thinking it's hundreds of guitars, when it's actually got less guitar tracks than most people's demo tapes have.\" Why?: The early 90s were the time of the so-called Alternative music revolution occurred (Nirvana, grunge, etc.), while it was actually an audience of people primarily listening to College rock, Post-punk music and indie music which expanded and exploded around the early 90s giving making the alternative the mainstream (sorry for the cliche). Grunge came and it feel, then Britpop came and it fell and now we mostly have Post grunge in the name of rock music. This album stands out as despite coming out at approximately the same time, the shoe-gaze movement didn't contribute to much of the whole rock music scene later onward. Honourable Mention: Turn On The Bright Lights by Interpol  Basic Info:This album is so depressing and dark but so profound and beautiful at the same time. This album for many reasons was criticized for being similar to Joy Division's music style, which I (and critics as well) disagree with. While they're quite influenced from the whole post-punk rock scene as a whole (come on they're called Post-Punk Revival artists, what elese you'd expect) Why?: This album again was quite underrated (but still received critical acclaim and came into many the grearest albums of the 2000s list), in comparison to well The Strokes in the whole Indie Rock explosion in the early 2000s. Simply put, this is a beautiful album, and despite its failure to invent a whole new genre of music, we must remember that is no reason to deem it unworthy. Interpol is an invitation to enjoy melancholy, and to ignore it as well. After all, it is important to note that these musicians were philosophy majors before their record deals, not drop-outs. Of course, you can cherry-pick annoyances with the above albums such as that the uninspiring Revolver (but the technical revolutions it brought and the unparalleled sound!), the almost formulaic Loveless ie they're simple pop songs with noise over it (isn't that amazing) and the inspired and what-not Interpol (seriously?). It's all a matter of taste. Most of the albums which I've mentioned above are the ones which are extremely unique (despite being influenced) for their times, but received less visibility than their peers (around the same time), and thus sadly failed to continue to dig deeper canals into the creation of new musical genres. Maybe that is ultimately good for unlike their peers they didn't fade away into commercialization and eventual musical irrelevance. Ultimately, listen and decide for yourself. Other Honourable Mentiones (which may or may not be greater than the above depending on subjective opinion):  Dark Side of the Moon - Pink FloydOk Computer - RadioheadThe Velvet Underground and Nico - The Velvet Underground and NicoExile On Main Street - The Rolling StonesLed Zeppelin IV - Led ZeppelinLondon Calling - The ClashUnknown Pleasures - Joy DivisionAre You Experience? - The Jimi Hendrix ExperienceGrace - Jeff Buckley (has anyone even heard about this beauty)Is This It? - The StrokesTen - Pearl JamNevermind - Nirvana Sources:Wikipedia and personal and critical opinion ",
