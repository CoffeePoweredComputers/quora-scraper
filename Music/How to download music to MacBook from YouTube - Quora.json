            "answer_text": "I\u2019m never the one to recommend illegal things. Some claim that converting a YouTube video into an MP3 file is not illegal. But that\u2019s something that YouTube would dispute. Technically, it\u2019s not illegal. If it was, YouTube would have taken down the popular converter sites and apps. I know how to download music on a MacBook, so I\u2019ll first share these alternatives for getting free music: Use Soundcloud, which is a great place for discovering free music.Jamendo has a great library of files that have been shared by the artists for free.If you\u2019re determined to get your music from YouTube, you can use a converter. Folx is an amazing app for Mac. It\u2019s fast and easy to use. You just copy the URL from a video, and you\u2019ll get it as an audio file. An app is a better option than a browser-based converter, since it\u2019s faster and it keeps the history of files that you converted. ",
