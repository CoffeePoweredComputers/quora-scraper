Mainly because of propaganda through media pushed by vank Voluntary Agency Network of Korea - Wikipedia also because of this type of propaganda Interview With Japanese Ultra Nationalists | ASIAN BOSS they are not even right wing groups because right wing groups don't use that type of flag, also this Why Are The Japanese Protesting Against China? | ASIAN BOSS there's no protest against china, This Lady Gets Paid To Apologize In Japan (Japanese Apology Agency) | ASIAN BOSS this company doesn't exist, Life As A \u201cComfort Woman\u201d: Story of Kim Bok-Dong | ASIAN BOSS Japan already paid reparations and apologies for what happened in 2015, Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe apologized even publicly, Korean Government need to stop this agenda of blaming others to hide their own fault. Otherwise if you hate someone sooner or later that person will hate you too. ",

Out of all the venues this was without a doubt the most difficult to get tickets. I've also had trouble getting tickets for other Korean groups playing there. Kpop is thriving in Japan. Most KPop groups do extremely well there. ",
