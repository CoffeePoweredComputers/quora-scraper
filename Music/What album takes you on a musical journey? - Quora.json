            "answer_text": "The album \u201c2112\u201d by the band \u201cRush\u201d takes its listeners on a musical journey. It is by far one of my favorite albums of all time, and is incredible. 2112 consists of one large 20 minute song (Its really just like 7 songs put together though) with some normal songs put in with it. The main song(s) which I refer to as the \u201c2112 story\u201d literally tells a story through music and song. The album literally takes you one journey through a musical story. The story is all about a futuristic civilization in the year 2112 that has an oppressive government. The people rise up against their government once the protagonist finds a guitar and discovers music. The lyrics tell the story throughout the music, and is one of the most amazing pieces of music I\u2019ve ever heard. This song definitely takes its listeners on a musical journey, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone willing to listen. Enjoy! ",
