            "answer_text": "I would suggest that Elizabeth get her facts straight before answering a question. Your whole scenario about MJ buying the Beatles catalog is filled with errors and half truths, but I won\u2019t go into all the mistakes in that answer as it really has nothing to do with the question. No MJ and John never met although Elizabeth was correct about Yoko and Sean. MJ wasn\u2019t the icon he was to become until after John\u2019s death. Also Michael didn\u2019t do the type of music that John was interested in. Edit: Although I said I wasn\u2019t going to get into it I changed my mind to some degree. MJ did check with Yoko but did not have to do that and it was done out of respect. He didn\u2019t bother checking with George or Ringo though and he certainly did not ask for Paul\u2019s blessing. Paul had initially asked Yoko to go in with him to buy back the music rights since John wrote many of the songs in the catalog but she opted not to partner with him in this venture. Below is more or less what transpired. The key point here is that holding the publishing rights to songs doesn\u2019t really give the rightsholder much  \u201cpower\u201d over those songs. The rightsholder has some latitude in negotiating royalty rates and determining who may use a song in film or print its lyrics, but that\u2019s about it. The chief benefit to owning the publishing rights of songs is that standard publishing agreements call for royalties to be split 50-50 between the publisher and the songwriter(s), so owning the publishing rights to popular songs can be a lucrative form of income. The Beatles assigned their publishing rights to Northern Songs, a company created by Beatles manager Brian Epstein and music publisher Dick James in 1963. The Beatles (particularly John Lennon and Paul McCartney) were soon earning so much money from songwriting royalties, record sales, concert performances, and merchandise licensing that they were losing over 90% of their income in taxes, and they were advised to find a way of receiving their revenue in the form of capital gains rather than income (the former being taxed at a much lower rate), such as selling their song rights or putting their money into a public company. The Beatles opted for the latter route, and Northern Songs went public on the London Stock Exchange in 1965. Initially, Lennon and McCartney each retained 15% of the shares, George Harrison and Ringo Starr held 1.6% between them, Brian Epstein\u2019s NEMS company was assigned 7.5%, and Dick James and Charles Silver (Northern Songs\u2019 chairman) retained a total of 37.5%. In 1969, however, the Beatles lost a buyout bid for control of Northern Songs when Dick James and Charles Silver sold their share of the company to Sir Lew Grade, head of Associated Television Corporation (ATV). In 1984, ATV\u2019s 4,000-song music catalog was put up for sale, and Michael Jackson (who had coincidentally been introduced to the benefits of song ownership by Paul McCartney himself) eventually outbid all other prospective buyers for it, including Paul McCartney, who wanted to buy back the rights to the Beatles\u2019 songs but was apparently unable or unwilling to raise enough money to pay for the thousands of other songs in the ATV catalog as well. So, for $47.5 million, Jackson acquired the publishing rights to most of the Beatles songs. (The four songs issued on the Beatles\u2019 first two singles \u2014 \u201cLove Me Do\u201d b/w \u201cP.S. I Love You\u201d and \u201cPlease Please Me\u201d b/w \u201cAsk Me Why\u201d \u2014 were not part of the package since they were published before the formation of Northern Songs, and the rights to those songs are now controlled by McCartney\u2019s MPL Communications. ATV also did not own the rights to George Harrison songs published after Harrison\u2019s songwriting contract with Northern Songs expired in 1968, but they did hold the rights to various other Lennon-McCartney songs not recorded by the Beatles.) Another key point here is that although Michael Jackson received 50% of the royalties generated by Beatles songs by virtue of his ownership of the publishing rights, Paul McCartney and John Lennon (and Lennon\u2019s estate, now that he\u2019s dead) have always received their 50% songwriter\u2019s share of the royalties for all Lennon-McCartney songs. Neither ATV\u2019s nor Michael Jackson\u2019s acquisition of Northern Songs changed that, and Michael Jackson did not receive royalties that would otherwise be going to the Beatles had he not acquired the publishing rights to their songs (except that, obviously, if Paul McCartney had managed to outbid Jackson for the publishing rights to the Beatles catalog, he and Lennon\u2019s estate would be splitting 100% of the royalties rather than 50%).

He never met Elvis either. The story that he met Elvis in Las Vegas where he took 6 year old Lisa Marie Presley to see the Jackson 5 perform is a bogus story his then talent manager came up with to justify his out of the blue publicity stunt marriage with Lisa Marie Presley.

Yoko was ok with it, Paul McCartney was an ass about it. But it was Paul's own fault for talking to Michael about song publishing and buying song's!! Paul McCartney just never thought Mike would have ever had any interest in song buying!! And Paul McCartney was offered a chance to buy the catalog himself but he didn't want to pay all that money for it and Mike couldn't wait forever so it became Michael's catalog!! ",
