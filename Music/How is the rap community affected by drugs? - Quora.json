            "answer_text": "No more so than rock and pop really. People associate issues with drugs with ( the very wide umbrella that is) rap music because it features more prominently in their lyrics. But it is hardly an issue confined to the genre. Here is a small selection of some of my favourites who have died from drug overdoses (and a few alcohol as well):                      Those are just some of the musicians who had serious issues with intoxicants that have nothing to do with rap music. You could make an even longer list with actors who overdosed (I didnt even include crossover stars like Monroe and Belushi) celebrities. Then you could get started on musicians and celebrities who have/had documented issues with drugs and alcohol who are still alive but no-one has enough free time to write a proper answer on that on Quora, even whilst furloughed under lockdown! To say that rap is affected by drugs is a lazy statement to make in my opinion. It is obviously an issue across all walks of life but I think it's reasonable to conclude that drug issues are more of a fame thing than a rap thing. Bonus Quora points for anyone who can name them all. I don't think any are particularly obscure, at least the bands aren't. ",
