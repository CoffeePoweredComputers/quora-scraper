            "answer_text": "I think they find it offensive because it accents Jesus' humanity rather than his divinity. Jesus was both human and divine. Most people who attack Christianity argue that Jesus was merely human, and not divine at all. Some Christians overreact, in my opinion, by overemphasizing Jesus' divinity at the expense of his humanity. Therefore any movie, or other medium, that shows how truly human Jesus was is viewed as an attack on Christianity.  This is an error in my view. Jesus really was tempted in many ways and since he was truly human, they were real temptations. Hebrews 4:15. [Note: It has been a long time since I saw the movie but I didn't find it offensive at the time.] ",

            "answer_text": "I hate the movie to the absolute core haven\u2019t watched that sinful movie but yes I have done my fair share of research about it. it is complete blasphemy. It was no way anything close to the scriptures, The Bible did say Jesus was human but it never said that Jesus took advantage of human pleasures he didn\u2019t entirely live the human life. He was the son of God in the form of human, so it makes no sense when these people portray Jesus as getting married and having Kids and all that. The main highlight of his life the sacrifice on the cross but the movie sort of covered that up and focused more on imagination. if your a Christian please don\u2019t watch this movie it\u2019s complete stupidity.
