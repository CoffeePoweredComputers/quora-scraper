            "answer_text": "Well, that\u2019s a tough question. The type of music I listen to varies a lot and consistently changes. But I\u2019ll just update you a bit on what I\u2019ve been listening to as of 2020: Mainstream music: Much of the mainstream music nowadays consists of genres like pop, EDM, rap and trap. I hear it mostly on the radio since there are so many stations in my area that play the latest hits alongside other types of music. And although I may get tired of hearing specific songs play over and over, there are certain artists and songs that are true gems and end up growing on me. My favorite mainstream artists as of today, I\u2019d say, are Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Halsey, Travis Scott and The Weeknd. One song that I\u2019ve become obsessed with lately is \u201cHate Me\u201d by Ellie Goulding and Juice WRLD (RIP).Indie pop/rock/folk: Some of my favorite artists in that category are Mitski, Lana del Rey, Girl in Red, Yeule, Sirotkin, Naadya, Fleet Foxes, Rosemary Fairweather, Clairo, The Wallows, and others. I feel like alternative music has a certain feel that separates it from the more mainstream, mass produced music. It tends to sound cozier, dreamier, more intimate, and sometimes more melancholy musically and lyrically, regardless of the exact genre. On another note, recently I\u2019ve had a thing for the hipster, \u201caesthetic\u201d-type counterculture that\u2019s emerging nowadays. Two songs I\u2019ve been listening to a lot frequently are \u201cRunaway\u201d by AURORA, and \u201cWhy Didn\u2019t You Stop Me?\u201d by Mitski.Post-punk/new wave: In case you didn\u2019t know, post-punk, which is a subgenre of rock music, emerged in the 70\u2019s out of a desire to break free from traditional punk and experiment with sounds. New wave is similar, except it\u2019s more pop-oriented. One thing that I love about this genre is how futuristic and melancholy it sounds. A strong, deep bass line, echoey and often eerie synth/guitar chords, and distorted vocals. A lot of my favorite artists in this genre are from the (former) Soviet Union, partly because I listen to a lot of Russian artists in general, and because new wave and post-punk music has really flourished around that area since the 80\u2019s. Some of my favorite artists in that genre are KINO, Molchat Doma, Buerak, Bioconstructor, Konets Elektroniki, and others. As for Western artists within the post-punk/new wave category, I do like Blonde, Joy Division, and the Cure.Classical: In my searches for possible piano pieces I could learn, or even just for casual listening, I\u2019ve discovered wonderful pieces and composers previously unfamiliar to me, and focused my listening repertoire on different musical time periods. Lately I\u2019ve been listening to mostly Russian composers, and mostly 20th century period music \u2014 I love how grand and progressive the music of that era sounded. I recently discovered the composer Nikolai Kapustin and listened to a few of his jazz-influenced Eight Concert Etudes; they were breathtaking and I think I found another favorite composer. I\u2019ve also been listening to some movements from Prokofiev\u2019s Alexander Nevsky and Lieutenant Kije suites, which are awesome.Lo-fi: My go-to music for studying, relaxing, or simply just concentrating while writing a Quora answer. It gains a lot of influence from both jazz and hip-hop, and samples a lot of different music. It\u2019s very calming and nostalgic, and the music itself kind of adds to those feelings by adding special effects in the background such as spoken quotes from TV and movies, or the dusty noise of a scratching vinyl record. I don\u2019t focus very often on who the artists are themselves while I\u2019m listening to lo-fi playlists or albums online, but I do like City Girl, Ambition, and Shiloh Dynasty.Video game OST music: I\u2019ve gotten into the mood of listening to some background music from video games, mostly Nintendo games. Some of my favorite tracks I\u2019ve listened to on repeat are Jump Up, Super Star from Mario Odyssey, Hopes and Dreams from Undertale, the Soviet March from Red Alert 3. As for the more chill stuff, I do love Milky Way Wishes from Kirby and the Rainbow Curse, and The Great Fairy Fountain from the Zelda series.R&B: I\u2019m less familiar with R&B than I am with other musical genres since I\u2019ve just started listening to it not long ago, but I like it. I love the sort of \u201curban\u201d feel it has, and how soulful and lush both the vocals and the instrumentation are. I\u2019ve been listening to some of the newer stuff lately. Some of the artists I\u2019ve been listening to are H.E.R., Thundercat, Kali Uchis, Willow Smith, Mario (no, not that one), and Solange Knowles, Beyonce\u2019s sister.Some other miscellaneous genres, such as chiptune, future bass, city pop, more political (leftist) music, and Vocaloid songs, all of which I don\u2019t really feel like explaining right now because this answer was a bit exhausting to write.",

            "answer_text": "First answer published on Quora*^_^* Here\u2019s the song I am listening to right now: \u7231\u7684\u4f9b\u6c27 - \u6ce0\u9e22yousa - \u7f51\u6613\u4e91\u97f3\u4e50 This song was originally sung by Yang Mi, and was the main theme song of a Chinese TV series called \u5bab\u9501\u5fc3\u7389(translated to \u201cPalace\u201d as seen on Wikipedia). The original work is here for your reference: \u7231\u7684\u4f9b\u517b\uff08\u7535\u89c6\u5267\u300a\u5bab\u9501\u5fc3\u7389\u300b\u4e3b\u9898\u66f2\uff09 - \u6768\u5e42 - \u7f51\u6613\u4e91\u97f3\u4e50 What\u2019s interesting is that, as you can figure out, the singer Lingyuan yousa deliberately performed the song in a somewhat strange but interesting manner at the beginning and the end, which makes it rather funny. But her performance is quite well when it comes to the highlights. In fact, Lingyuan's skillful in singing and has a lot of fans in China. Her fans are appreciated quite well among young people like me. Here are some screenshots of her Sina microblog:   In fact she is quite specialized in singing and has many great works. For instance: \u524d\u524d\u524d\u4e16\uff08Slow Ver.\uff09 - \u6ce0\u9e22yousa - \u7f51\u6613\u4e91\u97f3\u4e50 (Cover, not her original) This song is in Japanese but she managed it. And this one: \u9526\u9ca4\u6284 - \u6ce0\u9e22yousa - \u7f51\u6613\u4e91\u97f3\u4e50 (This is her cover, in Chinese) And here\u2019s an original work of her in Chinese, I'm putting it here as an advanced challenge for you: \u672c\u8272 - \u6ce0\u9e22yousa/\u6ce0\u9e22yousa\u306e\u5446\u840c\u5fc6 - \u7f51\u6613\u4e91\u97f3\u4e50 This is quite an interesting one as it implementes many elements from ancient Chinese. Thus this kind of songs are usually referred to as antiquity music in China. As you may have discovered, Lingyuan is quite good at preforming treble tones. Maybe she is not as well-known as singers like Jay Chou in China or Taylor Swift in the US, but that's never a problem, in my personal view. ",
