            "answer_text": "The voice is an instrument that utilize specific parts of the body. These parts become stronger as the voice is more practiced. But, like with any part of the body, over training can happen and then the parts don\u2019t function so well anymore. Think of an athlete that prepares for a long distance marathon. the athlete is not going to train at 100%, seven days a week. Typically the exercise regiment is varied and rest days are included so that the body can recover. The same is true for your voice. You can overtrain and then your voice becomes less effective - typically hoarse. What makes it worse is that many vocalists employ poor technique that puts even greater strain on their voices, so the need for rest is even greater. The problem with seriously straining your voice over a long time is that you can develop polyps or even cancer of the larynx. Mick Jagger supposedly had polyps removed in the early 2000\u2019s. ",
