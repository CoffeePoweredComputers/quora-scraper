            "answer_text": "None. Once you begin to play your instrument, of course, it will experience wear and tear. Pianos need to be tuned ($100 or so), from once a year to three years or so, depending on humidity, usage, heat, etc. If you move a lot, the cost of a mover (or pizza for friends who have a pickup truck) needs to be considered. If you want a pipe organ, a tuba, trombone or trumpet, or drums, you\u2019d better consider your neighbors! All acoustical instruments have moving parts or strings, but need surprisingly little lubrication or maintenance. A few bottles of oil will keep your trumpet going for two hundred years - more than a few drops can ruin a Hammond organ (by the way, that\u2019s in instrument you can make whisper-soft, if you live in an apartment - also electronic keyboards are no only volume-adjustable, you can put all the sound through headsets and rock out and your neighbors will never know). Playing instruments is good for your health; and you can play piano keys millions of times and never hurt your hand. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know that there are any disadvantages to owning any musical instrument. There are challenges, most certainly. For example, every saxophone will need to be re-padded by a competent instrument repair technician at several times during its life. In addition, the string bass: I\u2019ve never seen anyone transport one of these in a Mini Cooper. I recommend finding Garrison Keillor\u2019s The Young Lutheran\u2019s Guide to the Orchestra. It\u2019s a parody of Britten\u2019s The Young Person\u2019s Guide to the Orchestra. Keillor goes through a tongue-in-cheek analysis of each instrument family in the orchestra, with an emphasis on how it does or does not promote Christian values. It\u2019s hilarious! And sort of on point. :) ",
