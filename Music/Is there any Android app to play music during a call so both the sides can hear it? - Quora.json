            "answer_text": "Hi, ANSWER : NO Without reading proper document i went into building the application with feeding the MP3 player sound to the voice mic during the call.. In simple i was building Interactive Voice Response (IVR) application in Android 2010. I spent almost 10 months (part time) try to crack the same. My idea of the app was voice call says : dial 1 to take picture, dial 2 to send sms dial 3 to to change WIFI on etc I did DTMF part and was so close in completing the project.. i thought its going to be brilliant stuff\u2026. I even went to Hardware repair guy to come out with a cable/hardware element which will take speaker output data plugin directly to voice during the call. ALL failed miserably. Finally MediaPlayer | Android Developers helped me to understand why technically it is not possible. When i asked google guy in a meetup\u2026 simple answer he told me \u201cIt is done for Security reason, It can replace human without caller knowing. ;)\u201d . NOW you know why it is not allowed. :) EDITED on May 3 : Well google told me it can not replace human without caller knowing when i was building IVR for android. Guess what Google has come out with Google duplex with this feature. ",

But there's a catch, Even if you can play music during call it does not necessarily means that the person on the other side will hear it too.  For Example :When I use n7 on my device , me and my friend on the other side can both hear music. But it's not the same when my friend plays the music on her device, I can't hear anything.  So, it also needs to be supported by your device too.  My friend's device is Samsung Galaxy Mega 5.8Other Samsung Users (Some models atleast) complain about it.  You need to check for yourself, it's your device dependent ",
