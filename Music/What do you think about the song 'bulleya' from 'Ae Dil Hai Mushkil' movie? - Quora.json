After 2 days again heard it and the 2nd line of the song touched me near \u201ctasalli toh dilade\u2026\u201d and it kept growing in me since then. The song is a soulful track with powwrful voice of Amit Mishra full of feel, wonderful music by Pritam Da. But the real winner is the lyrics. It's undoubtedly one of the best lyrics of Bollywood of all time. Superb lyrics. The bird of his soul doesn't get even a small island of relief even after flying so long\u2026 The song works from the heart, the lyrics touch you, the feel touch you. The voice touch you. Undoubtedly best song of the year. ",
