            "answer_text": "I am so eligible to answer this, I am a hard core classic rock fan and I listen music all the time. ALL THE TIME!My review is based on songs with English lyrics mostly. I don\u2019t listen Hindi much. Services I\u2019m comparing here: Saavn, Gaana, Wynk, Amazon Music, Apple Music, Agni Music, Jio Music, Guvera, Hungama and Soundcloud Saavn: Saavn was founded in 2007 with the soul objective to stream Bollywood and regional songs. Later English songs were added to remain in competition with other music streaming services.It has over 36 million songs in over 15 languages.Pros: Great interfaceAudio Series/Shows are available and kept up to dateCons: Unavailability- Sometimes you can\u2019t stream songs for few days/weeks. Service thing probably but it\u2019s irritating. \u2018Pro-only\u2019- If a song is high on demand and is topping charts you are likely to see it move to \u2018Pro-only\u2019 feature. You won\u2019t be able to play it if you\u2019re using a free versionOffline music cannot be searchedSubscription costs average Rs. 999 for a year and Rs. 99 for a monthI\u2019ll rate it 4 out of 5  Gaana: It has over 30 million songsOne of the most affordable music streaming service in the marketYou are likely to find all Hindi songs but its English store is slow to update (latest English songs are available on this app later than other services like Saavn) and lacks various tracksPros: Even if you\u2019re using Gaana free ads are not that problematic (compared with Saavn). You can\u2019t skip ads in Saavn they\u2019d play after 2\u20135 songs and break the flow/mood of the listener. But in Gaana ads can be skipped after a certain durationCons: Slow to load if you\u2019re streaming very high qualitySubscription comes at a spectacular price of Rs.99/month, and annual subscription costs 1498 but there\u2019s always some offer going so you\u2019d get it for less than Rs. 600I\u2019ll rate it 4.1 out of 5Wynk: It has the least songs among all the services I am comparing here (they might quote it has this and that but the truth is I was unable to find half of the songs I wanted to stream)It\u2019s okay for Hindi songs but so not for EnglishPros: Airtel users get a great deal. They get it for lesser priceYou can download songs in your off-line library even though you haven\u2019t paid anythingCons: Poor interface. Although they did change it few months back but it still looks primitive App crashes sometimes (iOS)Buffering can get slow at timesWynk has a complicated price tiering depending on OS. If you are an Android user, the subscription costs the usual Rs 99/month. iOS users have to shell out Rs 120 per month, but iOS users with an Airtel SIM get a discounted rate of Rs 60/monthI\u2019ll rate it 3.8 out of 5Amazon Music: It\u2019s the latest service that has rolled out in the market. You can get it only after subscribing Amazon PrimeBeautiful App, great interface, no-ads (because it\u2019s an only-paid service)It\u2019s best if you use it only on your device.I was using Amazon Music from my brother\u2019s ID for a week, few weeks later I got my own Prime membership and when I logged in with my credentials this is what I got (image) and since I didn\u2019t have any songs in my offline library (I am new to this) this music service isn't any good to me for next 100 days. Now I\u2019m using it on my PC though. Pros: Big library of Hindi and English songsPC app is also availableCons: Authorization issue makes it kinda not-easygoingI\u2019ll rate it 4.6 out of 5Apple Music: It\u2019s hard to keep Apple at bay so here we are with undoubtedly the best music service available in IndiaBiggest English and Hindi library there to streamPros: Smooth functioning with a great interfaceAmazing radio 3 months free trial-that\u2019s a long time. And trust me if you are using it for 3 months you\u2019ll use it for the rest of your life.Cons: Only available for Apple customersEDIT: Dec 2016: Available for Android as well. You just need your iCloud ID. (Thanks Shrey for this EDIT)Sometimes few songs are unavailableSubscription costs Rs. 120/month, Rs. 60/month if you have a college/university ID and Rs. 180/month (family account up-to 9 users)And if you pay for the whole year at once it\u2019s Rs. 1200(instead of 120x12=Rs. 1440)I\u2019ll rate it 4.7 out of 5Agni Music: It\u2019s a fairly new service in the marketYou will only find trending or latest hitsYou can download them for freeI\u2019ll rate it 3.4 out of 5Jio Music: Jio music is like a whiff of fresh airThere\u2019s no such exact figures about the library it boasts but if you use this service you qualitatively know the answer. It\u2019s BIGPros: Good curation/recommendation Free, no premium versionCons: You need to have a Jio SIM to use the serviceIncomplete albumsEats DATA like crazyI\u2019ll rate it 3.8 out of 5Guvera: Guvera, an Australian music streaming service is a relatively lesser known application simply because it doesn't advertise as much. The library size is one of the biggest Whether it\u2019s the International or Indian one. It boasts of 6.5 million+ active users in India alonePros: Articles and reviews on varied topics(Movies, albums, songs)Good artist radiosApt suggestions and recommendationsNo notification spam (unlike Gaana)Cons: No option for setting streaming qualitySubscription prices are steepPoor album art collectionI\u2019ll rate it 3.7 out of 5Hungama: Pros: Good Bollywood and regional library.Cons: Too many ads User Interface is blandInconsistent search resultsThe International library is extremely limitedEach song/video(entity) can be downloaded a maximum of 3 timesI\u2019ll rate it 3.7 out of 5Soundcloud: All the above mentioned music services are like subsets of SoundcloudLet\u2019s say Guvera is Asia then Soundcloud would be our planetIt has tracks from emerging artists. You can create music and upload here. Easy as you like. Smooth flow, good UI, no ads make it one of the best thing you can wish forSometimes finding what you\u2019re looking for could be time taking and cumbersome though. I\u2019ll rate it 4.4 out of 5 Note: Spotify isn\u2019t available in India yet.I\u2019ll review that once it\u2019s available in App Store. EDIT: Since, Spotify is out so here\u2019s the review. It\u2019s a great app but certainly not the best.Great playlists and radios. Here\u2019s what I found new:You take a screenshot and SHARE option pops up:  After pressing SHARE multiple share options emerge:  And, there\u2019s a code sharing feature as well:  And this is the best feature available:  Don\u2019t play this song: A lot of playlists contain songs we hate. Like I hate \u201cShape of you\u201d, so I use this feature and disable that song without having to delete it from playlist. You can undo this anytime you want. Spotify is available for desktop also. Just like Amazon Music. Some songs on Spotify aren\u2019t playable because of ongoing feud with Warner Brothers so that makes your library a little bit smaller (just a little). Also, there\u2019s minute sound difference between Amazon Music, Spotify and Apple Music (I have compared these three for sound exclusively).Apple Music > Amazon Music > Spotify : This sound perception will vary from person to person and device to device. I used iPhone 5s to carry this test and also used Twinwoofer earphones later just to be sure. And track for the test was \u201cZero\u201d by Imagine Dragons.I have acclimatized with Apple Music\u2019s sound so this may vary my perception to an extent. I found Apple\u2019s sound best overall. Amazon had tiny extra depth but it sounded weird to me. Spotify(free version) sounded like studio\u2019s acoustic have little issue, not a big issue but there was some. Don\u2019t take the sound comparison seriously. Listen and decide!All three offer at least one month as trial so do your soundcheck and then decide. I haven\u2019t used Spotify much, I use Apple Music.I\u2019ll keep updating Spotify section with time. Spotify has compressed audio down to a bitrate of 160 kbps on desktop or 96 kbps on mobile devices \u2014 Spotify calls this rate \u201cnormal.\u201d Paid subscribers also have a \u201chigh quality\u201d option of 320 kbps audio on desktop. High-fidelity or lossless audio has a significantly higher bitrate of 1,411 kbps.Apple offers 256 which is lower than Spotify (premium). I\u2019ll rate Spotify 4.6 out of 5.  ",

            "answer_text": "Wynk Music, obviously. Quick to dive in. No registration required at all. It lands directly on the content.Discovery of songs. It\u2019s matter of personal choice though, you see more relevant content right from the start of the app through better placement and categorization.It has better UX than any other in the competition. Less rings and bells, easy to use, better accessible options.Works better on slow networks like 2g/3g than any other app.Better curated playlists, then again it matter of personal taste.First among competition to provide streaming at 320kbps.Wynk supports playing local songs. Only other app which supports this is gaana, However, unlike gaana, this app also enhances the information/meta of local songs and shows them with pretty images and cleaned up info (like removal of sites info from where the song is downloaded) [PS: this feature is in staged roll-out phase, so don't worry if you haven't get the update yet]However, in recent time, they seems to be struggling with the content rights. Hope they overcome it soon otherwise all of these advantages are of no use. ",
