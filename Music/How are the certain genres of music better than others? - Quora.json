            "answer_text": "Choice of music depends on a clear option (to the listener/buyer/follower) of the style and content of the (usually recorded) item. Live Musical shows are different again as there are the obvious VISUAL appendages added to the psyche. What I am attempting to cover are the often overlooked, sometimes seemingly MAGNETIC attachment to a number. EG,the Very Beautiful Jennifer Rush singing a number with passion, her voice, range, enunciation and passion shine brightly, not to mention her vocal range, whilst Celine Dion who has also recorded this wonderful number,lacks the sheer passion of Jennifer Rush. What I am saying is really that EMOTION has an important part to play in TASTE, i.e like or dislike, there are many factors involved, even age for example, memories, good or bad, preference of the actual musical accompaniment. Age is especially important when one considers the choice of a teenager, against the same choice of an adult male or female, this due to life experiences of the older person/listener. Taste in music is good material for a PhD on the subject. Lastly I would suggest that expression of like and dislike is also an age thing with regard to choosing a particular genre and simple extrapolation may assist in finding why genre is,in fact, relevant. Hope this assist you in your quest for reason. ",

We each typically have a favorite, followed by a ranking of others we like in declining order, followed by any we dislike. A very personal hierarchy. I\u2019m a lifelong rocker, but I occasionally enjoy almost any melodic genre. I personally am not a Rap fan because it is, by nature, amelodic. I like my songs with a melody, and Rap seems more of a Spoken Word phenomenon. I am, however, warming up to some Hip-Hop entries, provided that they are melodic (i.e. songs, not spoken word poetic performances). I play in a band and, by member vote, we play mostly Rock; also some Blues and Country. ",
