            "answer_text": "Anything with a weird time signature. Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cThe Ocean\u201d is in 15/8 time. It is very difficult to play. Pink Floyd\u2019s \u201cMoney\u201d in 7/8 time but that changes a few times during the song, making it very hard to play. Any good Progressive Rock, like ELP or Yes is difficult because of the musicianship that is necessary. Later Steely Dan is also difficult for the same reason. ",

When they were rehearsing for one of the albums several of their songs were so complicated that they could not actually play their songs all the way through they were that difficult to play. This from an interview with Geddy Lee. ",
