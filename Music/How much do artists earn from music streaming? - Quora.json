            "answer_text": "It differs from country to country. It also differs from paying customers and non paying customers. Also in the mix is the streaming sites. They all are different in what they pay. I get paid as high as .008 from Spotify. From Tidal and Napster I get paid .01. Unfortunately, Spotify has the most members of paying and non-paying customers. I have almost 2 million streams on Spotify. If I had that on Tidal or Napster then I could brag about it. Even Amazon pays a little higher rate than Spotify. That\u2019s why we tour. That\u2019s where the money is. Even sales of CD\u2019s suck. I predict that CD\u2019s will be obsolete soon. ",

            "answer_text": "Spotify pays between six/tenths of a penny and eight/tenths of a penny per song stream to the rights holder, who might be the artist. So if I\u2019m the artist and I have the rights to these 10 songs, you listen to them, I get six cents. If the artist doesnt have rights to the music, he or she might get a cut of that six cents, or nothing at all. ",
