            "answer_text": "Most songs don\u2019t remind me of anything, but some random songs do remind me of other times in the past I that had listened to the song. The Killers\u2019 Somebody Told Me reminds me of one time I was at the hairstylist getting my hair cut. The song started being played on the radio and I recognized it and remembered that I used to love it years before, but had forgotten the lyrics apart from something about someone having a girlfriend, until it came on the radio during the haircut. I looked up the lyrics when I got home, and now I\u2019m reminded of getting my hair cut whenever I listen to the song. Thirty Seconds to Mars\u2019 song Vox Populi reminds me of a field trip I went on with my grade 8 class to a museum. We took the subway to get to the museum and while on the subway, I ended up playing that song on repeat for an hour, and now that song always reminds me of being bored on the subway. Linkin Park\u2019s Until It Breaks reminds me of being in New York for summer vacation, and that whenever I listened to it, I ended up skipping to the end of the song because I loved the sung final verse of the song (and in the middle of the song, but I usually ended up skipping right to the final verse), although when I listen to the song now I can actually sit through all the rapping in it before that verse. Linkin Park\u2019s entire The Hunting Party album reminds me of the summer before grade 9, and that it was basically all I listened to that summer. I was going to what was called \u201csummer school\u201d but I don\u2019t think we really learned anything, and that it was basically a glorified day camp (all I remember doing there was making miniature tree houses with popsicle sticks), and the entire album just reminds me of walking home during the summer, playing the album on repeat. It also reminds me of one time that I nearly dropped my iPod into a puddle after getting out of my mom\u2019s car when she dropped me off at the school/camp in the morning but that my earbuds saved my iPod because I was listening to the album, but I don\u2019t remember which song was playing when it happened. A bunch of The Birthday Massacre\u2019s songs remind me of when I first got my first iPod and would just spend my entire recesses in grade 7 sitting on a windowsill (the windows in the school were pretty tall and their bottom was pretty close to the ground, and the alternative was sitting on the ground itself) and just listening to their songs on repeat. Most notably, I remember loving their song Control despite having absolutely no idea what the lyrics where, even though when I listen to it now I can clearly hear the lyrics and have no idea why I thought she was singing about \u201cthe fading grass of just our love\u201d, among so many other misheard lines from that song. Paramore\u2019s song Let The Flames Begin always reminds me of when I first got interested in singing along to songs. I\u2019m pretty sure I sounded terrible back then, but I remember I used to have a lot of fun singing along to Paramore\u2019s songs, especially Let the Flames Begin, however bad I must have sounded. Evanescence\u2019s Imaginary and The Birthday Massacre\u2019s Leaving Tonight also remind me of this, but Let The Flames Begin stands out the most. ",

            "answer_text": "This question comes right on time because I just played this song recently: Haruka Kanata by Asian Kung-fu Generation. Well, as many people may know, this song is from an anime called Naruto and one of songs for the earliest season for that anime. Every time I play this song, I will remember my late-little brother. He was 14 months or so during that time and he was in the stage of learning on how to speak. He sometimes cooing, babbling, prattling and what not. He was so cute and we were all anticipated to listen to his \u2018new\u2019 words as he tried so hard to talk to us. One day, my big brother played this song aloud and the whole house, we can all hear it. Little did we know, my little brother was anticipated and started to \u2018sing\u2019 along. As his little action to sing along was amusing, I pressed the REPLAY button. He really immersed into that song, he then started to shake his head slowly, pressing his hand as if he was holding a mic and move his body as if he was dancing. But surprisingly enough, no one was dancing other than him, only him started to move his body himself. We were all amazed as we don\u2019t know where he learnt that, but he seems really enjoying the song that much. Then, we all started to do the same to sing along and keep repeating it until we were all out of gas (not to forget, we are not Japanese and we are not living in Japan. So, basically, we just blurt out whatever words that came out from our mouth.). I will never forget that moment because that was one of the best memory I had when he was still alive :) ",
