            "answer_text": "Everyone can sing! Yes, you read it right! Actually, it entirely depends on how passionate you're while you sing. How sincerely you utter each and every words in the lyrics. How deliberately you want the song to be as perfect as the original singer, or how beautifully you manage to sing the song with your own added tunes! Yeah, there are many people all around the world, who are extremely talented and gifted with a beautiful voice, and there are some, who has been practicing all there lives to get it perfect, but unfortunately, many of them are unsuccessful, while some of them has won millions of hearts, who we know as celebrities. Singing is all about passion! Before you sing, you need to LOVE the song! You need to get the tune in your heart and your voice! One cannot sing, only by determining that he/she needs to! One can sing, when he/she thinks that they'll convey the messages of their heart through the songs! One can sing, when he/she knows how to play with their voices, along with the tunes and lyrics, just the way the artists/painters plays with the colors! It's very easy, yet so difficult! But I believe everyone can sing, just in different forms! Some can sing pop and jazz, while others find classical songs easier. Some can add expressions to the lyrics, while others can only get it done with the perfect understanding of the tunes! A song itself has so many things in it, that it's hard to get into the depth of it, but just like how there's a difference in an art of a kindergarten student and a professional artist, music comes along with knowledge! The more you know music, the lyrics (the perspective of the lyricist) and the tunes, the more you'll know how to sing! Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Unless a person has a physical, medical limitation such as amusia, there is no reason why they can\u2019t learn to sing. More likely the reasons they don\u2019t are because they don\u2019t want to, don\u2019t believe they can, don\u2019t care enough about singing to try, and/or are unable to afford lessons, which require time, money, and regular investment in practice. Given support from an excellent teacher, or at least a guiding trained ear in a friend, pretty much anyone can sing reasonably. They may not be professionals or make money singing, but they can sing for their own enjoyment. People can\u2019t change the build of their vocal instrument, but they can learn how to use it well. The main block is just overcoming the fear of being heard, even if the sound isn\u2019t pretty. With time, everyone can reconcile what they hear in their head with the recorded version of themselves, if they take lessons and understand vocal technique. Learning builds confidence over time, and that self-faith is really what it takes to sing. ",

            "answer_text": "Now, although almost anyone can learn to sing well, not all of these people have naturally good instruments. Most people don't associate the term \u201cinstrument\u201d with vocalists, but the truth is that vocalists do have instrument; they just happen to be their voices. After that, in my experience about 3 in 10 musicians have a great singing voice. Go to my Profile and you can find all about Learn To Sing material there... ",
