            "answer_text": "At this age, you want to avoid \"subjects\", and like Jean Marion said, just answer questions when they come up. As for active procedures, what you want to do is focus on musical experience. Singing is absolutely paramount, and so is dancing, body percussion, playing as many instruments as you can get your hands on, even conducting. These activities should be mostly based on imitation. You sing or play music with him, and try to get him to (a) experience aspects of music (higher/lower pitch, changing dynamics, a beat, a division, a characteristic rhythm) and imitate you in performing them (b) become aware of that element or aspect (\"notice how we were getting slowly louder, and then slowly softer? And that part when we were alternating between very loud and very soft, really fast?\", etc) and (c) try it in another context (a piece he is working on, an improvisation, etc). Since you're a harpsichordist, I'm assuming you have some familiarity with practical harmony, and possibly improvisation. This will be really useful so you can play and play with music with him, accompanying him (solid accompaniment helps develop intonation, as well as melodic and rhythmic accuracy) and especially improvising with him. When doing improvisation exercises, what you want to do is set restrictions: \"you have these two/three keys for yourself (I usually go for black keys, because then it's easy to expand to pentatonicism); I'll be playing something down here, and you play there and make something that goes with it.\" As time passes, you'll expand their pallette of, but mostly you want to take this opportunity to use the elements you taught them through imitation (crescendo/diminuendo, staccato/legato, subito dynamics, repetition/variation, etc), which is easier if they don't have to think about too many notes at the same time. This covers general musicianship. For playing, you should avoid focusing on repertoire too much: the most important things are for your nephew to learn how to play in a relaxed manner, develop physical and mental endurance, accept failure as part of the learning process, and catch \"the bug\". Improvisation and imitation help with this, since it turns playing into \"playing\", and he will seek to do it of his own accord. Whatever you end up getting him to play, focus on monitoring his posture, position and physical actions, and to make him aware of the musical elements. This is a golden age to develop these good habits, and will make it much easier to introduce notation and theory later - when it'll just be assigning names to things he already knows how to do. Hope I helped! Sources: been doing this for some time, including with a godson who started at 7, and am currently pursuing a degree in this exact field. ",

            "answer_text": "The child is the leader here.  They ask questions and you answer them.  They show interest in a specific song or instrument and you share your knowledge and interest.  Since there is no way to know at this point which direction he will go, it's best to let him experiment with anything that catches his attention at this point. You can make an effort to tie it all together via notes, timing, math, beauty, talent, etc... Let him know that playing music is generally difficult for most people but that for certain special children it isn't hard at all.  Usually at that point they like to prove that in fact it is not difficult. Sing together in the car.  Listen to different types of music on the radio and see if he can identity the genres.  Teach him how to count the beats and tell what the timing is for particular songs.  Teach him how to conduct the music he is listening to by counting the beats. At this point it is a journey of discovery.  Trying to instill not only a love of all things music but an interest in continuing on and wanting to learn more.  Don't push, let him lead.  Obviously he is probably interested in other things other than music.  Let everything sort of blend together.  Point out music in every day things.  Even video games have special music.  See if he can tell from the sound of the music what the composer was trying to portray; fear, happiness, excitement, etc... He is at just the right age, and if you make it fun and not work, you can create a music lover for life. ",
