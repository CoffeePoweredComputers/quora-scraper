            "answer_text": "well, she\u2019s at her peak at the moment and Thank U, Next has brought her much respect and popularity within the industry. and with that, there\u2019s also more haters. it\u2019s sort of a pattern with all artists. the more people know you, the more people form an opinion on you. and the more people form an opinion on you, the more they criticise you in whatever way they can. we can\u2019t deny that she\u2019s earned hate and people find her basic more these days. it\u2019s sort of what happens with being famous unfortunately. some people actually don\u2019t like her and some people just do it because others do. it\u2019s with every artist, especially at their peek. her music is controversial and many people like it while many people do not. ariana addressed that she knows that people like her music and some don\u2019t and that\u2019s okay (2019 Zach Sang interview). her music isn\u2019t really \u201cbasic\u201d or \u201cunique\u201d. like all opinions, it\u2019s what you interpret it as. some people find it mainstream and they\u2019re not wrong or right. we can\u2019t deny her songs are often pop songs and a lot of people find them basic. however, a lot of people find it unique and again it\u2019s not wrong or right. such as me. i started becoming a fan watching her interviews and while her music didn\u2019t make me a fan, after i started loving her because she seemed like a genuine and sweet girl, i explored her discography and loved it. i find it very healing and i love how as time passes, she\u2019s more and more open with them. My Everything, her 2nd album was a hit and was more focused on songs that people would like rather than what she herself liked. so was Dangerous Woman. she\u2019s said she doesn\u2019t like songs such as Why Try, Bang Bang and Touch It which were included on her earlier albums. however, now you\u2019ll find she loves her newer songs and is more focused on what she wants to do. without a doubt, her 2 latest albums have been much more close to her heart. she participated in writing every song on Thank U, Next and her newer songs were based on personal experiences or more light-hearted songs that she wrote for fun. however, recent pop culture has most likely influenced her sound and they may sound generic to many people. some people like her music and some don\u2019t. we don\u2019t know the future but seeing her rising fame, it\u2019s not unlikely she\u2019ll have a \u201cflop\u201d era when it comes to non-listeners. she\u2019s doing quite well with her music right now and also healing mentally from her trauma she\u2019s been through. she seems to be in a good place right now but maybe in the future she won\u2019t have a hit era and that\u2019s okay. ups and downs come with artistry and time will tell where her career is headed. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Are you wondering if Ariana will suffer backlash that\u2019s analogous to what happened to Mariah Carey when Glitter was released? That\u2019s entirely possible. However, what you refer to as \u201cbasic,\u201d others see as \u201chuman\u201d or \u201cconversational.\u201d Ariana has displayed a knack for tapping into ways of making music in the current pop music environment that allow her to be a diva but still relevant. As your \u201cquestion\u201d suggests, there will always be hate when an artist experiences great success. That phenomenon is the very origin of the word \u201chater\u201d as a distinct label for someone who is resentful or jealous of someone\u2019s success, often simply because of the success itself and not because of any underlying rationalization that the negative feeling is righteous and justified because the artist in some way didn\u2019t deserve the success. Ariana will not always be as popular or successful as she is now, but that only reflects the way popularity and success cycles work. It won\u2019t \u201cprove\u201d she is overexposed or that her artistic output is inferior. It happens to all artists. ",
