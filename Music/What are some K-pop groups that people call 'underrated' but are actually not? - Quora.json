Maybe some people want them to be as famous as bts and blackpink (they even talk about how boring/weak bp is), but they already are famous af. Loona\u2013 Well, they might not be that famous (yet), but they are not underrated. People are always praising their talent and choreography's, and until sometime ago you could see a lot of \u201cstan loona\" everywhere. Got7\u2013 I have to say that they were \u201cbigger\" some years ago. I mean, they are famous but are kinda forgotten. ",
