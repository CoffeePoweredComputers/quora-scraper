            "answer_text": "There is no best to buy, there is just what you\u2019d like when it comes to sound and experience. I started out with Hohner Bluesharps / Marina Bands, but my kit now is entirely made out of Lee Oskars. The Hohners have wood combs, the Lee\u2019s have \u201cplastic\u201d ones. This changes the tone, where woods makes the feel a bit warmer.Also keep in mind that these are Diatonic harmonica\u2019s in a Major tuning, which is perfect for the blues scale. Where as chromatic ones (normal music scale) are harder to learn to play. If you are starting out, go for the Hohners they are very forgiving harps. ",
