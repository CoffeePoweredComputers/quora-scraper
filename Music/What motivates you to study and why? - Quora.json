            "answer_text": "HE IS THE ONE WHO INSPIRED ME. A PERSON WHO TOPPLED THE WORLD WITH HIS IDEOLOGY: LET US SEE HIS PASSION FOR LEARNING: A 21-year-old teenage boy was diagnosed with motor neuron disease, more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). He was not expected to live for more than two years. Completing his doctorate did not appear likely. Yet, Hawking defied the odds, not only attaining his Ph.D. but also forging new roads into the understanding of the universe in the decades since. As the disease spread, he became less mobile and began using a wheelchair. Talking grew more challenging and, in 1985, an emergency tracheotomy caused his total loss of speech. A speech-generating device constructed at Cambridge, combined with a software program, served as his electronic voice, allowing him to select his words by moving the muscles in his cheek. Even though the disease destroyed his response system, it did not have any impact on his powerful thoughts. His body did not respond to his commands but his mind was not ready to accept the denial. He did everything that he could do to give a noble contribution to his field of study. You may be more interested to know the name of that great person, it is none other than the great Stephen Hawking-the uncrowned king of physics. Stephen Hawking was regarded as one of the most brilliant theoretical physicists in history. His work on the origins and structure of the universe, from the Big Bang to black holes, revolutionized the field, while his best-selling books have appealed to readers who may not have Hawking's scientific background. \"All of my life, I have been fascinated by the big questions that face us, and have tried to find scientific answers to them. If like me, you have looked at the stars, and tried to make sense of what you see, you too have started to wonder what makes the universe exist.\"  It is not possible for every human to become a Stephen hawking but I think that it is possible for every human to work hard like Stephen hawking Luck may not bend according to your needs but hard work will.
