            "answer_text": "Mark is def Protestant Christian (maybe evangelical/non-denominational) His dad is a pastor, he's played guitar at church, he\u2019s thanked God at awards shows, he prays before scary movies and meals, he wasn\u2019t allowed to believe in Santa, and he\u2019s quoted the Bible. He said in 2018 that he had never celebrated Halloween as well. Yet he curses the most and has a dirty mind\ud83e\udd23 Johnny is prob Protestant Christian, he auditioned with a hymn. But he\u2019s private about it. There\u2019s plenty of Korean churches in the US. Joon Lee has a video called \u201c5 signs you grew up a Christian\u201d and he said that almost every single Korean/Korean-American he met growing up went to church at some point in their lives. They start going for community reasons, but then they actually become religious. It\u2019s possible he went to some Korean church in the US. Doyoung is supposedly Christian as well. He sang in a choir. He might not be religious as Mark though. Haechan is Christian?? I know he got a Bible from Mark but has he confirmed it?? He also sang in a church choir. Someone let me know, Hyuck might be the same as Doyoung in that he doesn't really go to services/be super religious like Mark. Yuta has an altar in his home in Japan (I think Buddhist) Japanese people do have home altars and go to shrines/temples but it\u2019s more of a cultural, not religious belief. There are some people in Japan who are very religious, but generally speaking, Japanese people aren\u2019t that religious. He also said that he wants to be a woman in his next life, so I think he believes in reincarnation. Ten is def Buddhist. He was a monk for a little bit (a mandatory law in Thailand) and he can't eat beef. (Thai Buddhists borrowed the practice from Hinduism) Jeno grew up Catholic but I think he doesn\u2019t practice anymore. I\u2019m not so sure about the others. ",
