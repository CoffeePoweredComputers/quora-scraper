A copy writer is someone who \u201cwrites copy\u201d, \u2018copy\u2019 being a term in the advertising and magazine trade for text written to fill a customer\u2019s requirements.

That is the license from the government which gives an author the right to make and sell copies of his work while other may not do so. Because most people first encounter the word copyright in a book, they sometimes confuse right with the homophone write. There is no word copywrite. There are the words copyright, copyrights, and copyrighted. ",
