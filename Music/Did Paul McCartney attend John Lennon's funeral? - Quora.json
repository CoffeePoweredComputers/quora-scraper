She only let Ringo to get inside and it was difficult because she didn\u2019t want Barbara there. Ringo had to convince her that, as John liked his wife, she had the right to enter. John wanted to be buried but Yoko decided to cremate him. Paul visited her some days later. And David Bowie spent the whole night outside with other fans. He even participated in the procession with candle light. Elton John wrote a song for him: Empty garden. ",
