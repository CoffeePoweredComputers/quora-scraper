            "answer_text": "I grew up listening to Black music pretty much exclusively (Soul, Jazz, Blues, even raised with Nigerian Hi-Life). I was a huge snob about it, too, being fairly vocal about my dislike of Rock music. Emily Fisher's answer to What was the first album you ever bought (with your own money, not given as a gift)? When I left home in 1972 as soon as I turned 17, and moved to a tiny coal mining town at 8,000 feet in the Colorado Rockies, I knew full well there would be no Black people or Jews there \u2014 the only people I knew and trusted \u2014 but my need to be in the mountains was extreme enough that I gave up my people for the necessity of altitude. Emily Fisher's answer to How important was your hometown in shaping who you are? That began my crusade of insidiously trying to broaden the musical tastes of the hippies by switching their sounds mid-acid trip, from The Grateful Dead to Coltrane. Soon I realized I had to start more gradually, with Eric Burdon, pre-War, his long trip-worthy Tobacco Road spouting, \u201cWhen the acid trip is over, you\u2019ve got to go back to Mother Booze\u201d. Sly and the Family Stone was also an easier bridge for them, and I slowly made some headway, found they could accept Rahsaan Roland Kirk far easier than John Coltrane. Meanwhile, I was being worked on as well. A Bluegrass band from the Louisiana Bayou moved to town, and stole my heart with their fine picking and party down souls. AM Radio in the NYC area where I\u2019d come up during the Sixties was quite broad, included pretty much every type of popular music but Country. I think it was probably the only place in the U.S. in which you couldn\u2019t find Country music anywhere on the dial. I prided myself in my musical knowledge (of course I lied a bit about not knowing any music that wasn\u2019t Black), and was familiar with a number of international sounds, as well, but I knew absolutely nothing about any kind of Country music, and never thought to be curious. As close to exposure to Country as we got in the NYC metropolitan area was in the very late Sixties, with the old TV variety show, Hee Haw - Wikipedia, and nobody watched that unless really high and willing to fall over furniture in an exaggerated attempt at a jig. But when the Bluegrass band from the bayou, Cornbread, moved to tiny town, they instantly became my best friends, with a speed and ease usually reserved for Black people, however unconsciously. (That\u2019s when I first discovered how Black the Deep South is, which confused me: Emily Fisher's answer to Have you ever had a run in with the KKK?) I quickly became immersed in both Cornbread\u2019s fine picking and their record collections. 45 years later, they\u2019ve shown up in a couple of my answers here. I danced my ass off when Cornbread played every Thursday night at the one bar\u2019s Boogie Night, and I began my lingering acclaim for developing varyingly fabulous disguises in order to make it past the bouncers each week, though they were specifically on the lookout for me, being that I was still 3 years too young to drink legally, and made fools of them at the end of each Thursday night, when I ripped off my disguise and took a bow. Gradually, in later life, I began listening to quite a lot of Traditional Country music. By the time NWA released Straight Outta Compton, I was living in Echo Park, with a broader variety of records and tapes than ever before, booming through the hills with the shocking-for-the-times sound system I inherited from my mother\u2019s ODed cousin, a system I was proud of until it disintegrated in one too many earthquakes. Straight Outta Compton changed everything for me, as for some time I couldn\u2019t stand to listen to anything else. I hadn\u2019t felt quite like that for a decade or two, since swooning to Soul records with \u201cthe arm over,\u201d as a kid. I didn\u2019t yet know anyone who listened to Rap, but with my snobby eclectic tastes, that was nothing new \u2014 by then I didn\u2019t know anyone else who listened to Country, either. There in the 80s, my listening eventually boiled down to approximately 50% Rap/50% Country, and everyone thought I was nuts, especially, eventually, those who listened to Rap but shunned Country, and the other way around. And so began my next crusade, after my decade\u2019s earlier attempt to convert the hippies. I was out to convince the world they were wrong in thinking there was a screaming dichotomy between Country and Rap, that they both told explicit True Life stories with dramatic cultural flair and a beat. That one didn\u2019t go over any better than Coltrane did, though later I began meeting others who were very into both Rap and Country, all 10-20 years younger than I, and mostly women. Then a life changing experience caused me to leave LA in \u201893 and move onto 2000 acres without electricity in the Sonoma Hills. Emily Fisher's answer to What is an incident that changed your life? But how to make a damn living from so deep in the wilderness, still more than a decade away from being introduced to the internet? I checked out the want ads in the local paper out of Santa Rosa (1 1/2 hours away) and found one for exotic dancing, what the fuck. I\u2019d certainly never done or even thought about anything like that before, though by then I was well aware that James Brown had taught my dancing to look like fucking at a very young age. Emily Fisher's answer to What is the worst thing you have ever been falsely accused of? So how hard could it be? I didn\u2019t really envision being employed doing this so much as \u2014 in a scratching off things that were never on your bucket list kind of way \u2014 I couldn\u2019t think of one good reason not to at least go in and audition, with the required 2 \u201cdance\u201d pieces of my own choice. And speaking of \u201cChoice,\u201d did your ever hear a highly explicit woman rapper by that name out of 1990 Houston? Choice (rapper) - Wikipedia No idea what ever happened to her, as I\u2019ve heard no music at all for many years, for various fucked reasons, but for a couple of years before leaving LA, Choice was my everything, the only woman I knew of who truly spoke her damn mind. Emily Fisher's answer to When did you find yourself unexpectedly on stage?  (Fuck Quora for turning the videos into this ugly shit \u2014 who in their right mind would click on this hideosity?) Now here\u2019s the part where I\u2019m sorry to say I can\u2019t supply proper details. Some time in the early 90s, before I left LA for the wilderness, a tune came out on cassette that may have actually had Country Rap in the title, but in any case, though I can\u2019t produce the title or artist, that\u2019s what it was, the first I ever heard until losing my mind over Gangstagrass when I caught it on Justified 20 years later. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eAffMSpW8KM Yup, I did go in for an exotic dancing audition with 2 pieces of my own choice. One was to one of Choice\u2019s most raunchy raps, and the other was that Country Rap, during which I stripped down from one pinto pony printed thing to continually lesser ones, while salaciously riding a pinto pony on a stick. That\u2019s how devoted I was to exposing the sexiness of Country Rap with an anecdote for eternity, stripping to it for strange men in a rented room! I\u2019m guessing, though it seems wrong to me, that my love of both traditional Country music and Hip Hop are my biggest supposed discrepancies, but my musical tastes remain all over the map. Epilogue: As part of a barricade-leaping gesture that could have gotten me arrested, in 1991 I bridged the gap to turn Dolly Parton on to Choice (while working on my own rap which sampled the opening bongos in Jolene). \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Thanks to Aaron Ellis for the inspiration. If I\u2019d known he lives in LA, I\u2019d have tried to meet him when I was just there, gone out to hear some music, which I never did once... ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t have a preferred genre of music. I have somewhat broad tastes and many reasons for that taste. In my youth, and through my undergraduate years, I was a trained pianist and greatly enjoyed that, and still like classical music a great deal. I enjoy playing it, and I enjoy listening to it. But there is a part of me, a small part, that will always think of it a little like work. It\u2019s just residue from my time of training. Not that I hate work and effort, quite the opposite. But music doesn\u2019t always have to be those things. I like some metal, some harder rock, and plenty of classic rock from the 60\u2019s. But I grew up in 90\u2019s the era of whiny, post-modern, neo-punk grunge. And it was the thing. Green Day\u2019s Dookie was everywhere. Soundgarden being angst-ridden and hugely popular, Nirvana\u2019s powerful social commentary from Smells Like Teen Spirit was still powerful. And the power-pop California sound of Weezer was embedded in the culture of the well-to-do kids that I associated with. I was very much a child of the times and listened to all of it. And I hated it. To me, most of the alternative rock at the time was just that; angst-ridden, whiny crap. It felt weak, and from a young age, I\u2019ve had a powerful aversion to personal weakness. Listening to Green Day whine about \u201cgoing crazy\u201d (I was a kid, I didn\u2019t have the advanced sensitivity to others issues I do now) and how some girl didn\u2019t like the lead singer. That amazing piece of shit Adam\u2019s Song about Blink-182\u2019s loneliness. It all bothered me, as did its effect on those around me. Everyone tried to pick up the grunge style. The hair, the horrid Jnco jeans, and the \u201csigh, why\u201d attitude. Hence my early adoption and love of Rap. Real music, from people with actual problems, music about personal ambition and creating power for yourself. Here was music for someone who isn\u2019t a whiny weakling filled with angst. Tupac\u2019s album All Eyez On Me was an eye-opener. I was introduced to it by another student in karate, and it felt right. Now, I\u2019ve been familiar with rap before this, going back to hearing Straight Outta Compton by NWA years after it was released. But All Eyez On Me was the shit. It had rhythm, it had beat, it had lyrics about life. It had power. It was more than California Love, as awesome as that song is. Ambitionz az a ridah was a great song, with powerful lyrics about an existence. My attitude was \"fuck it\", cause motherfuckers love itTo be a soldier, must maintain composure at easeThough life is complicated, only what you make it to be Could I personally identify? No, I was a privileged white-kid. But what I could identify with was powerful personal ambition and having a general \u201cdon\u2019t fuck with me\u201d attitude.  Diddy\u2019s Forever was good, Victory would come later. Which was my walkout/hype song for a couple of kickboxing tournaments:  Before that, as high school began and we were at peak Blink-182, I was listening to Nas, loving Nas\u2019s flow and ability. After I got my license in 2001, it wasn\u2019t uncommon to hear me roll up to school blasting Hate Me Now (a song I love dearly to this day), while many others were listening to a mix of post-grunge pop-rock and pop-country. At least many others in my social circles. \u201cYou have to listen to Radiohead.\u201d No, thank you:  That\u2019s a great song, but all of I am\u2026 is a good to great album. Then, then came Tech N9ne. One of my personal favorites. Everready being one his most well-known albums, but there are several that are seriously good. His Worldwide Choppers and powerful Speedom are just impressive feats of lyrical ability:  Again, we have a whole album that\u2019s good in Special Effects. Eminem murders the flow in Speedom, his ability is impressive. So speaking of Eminem, one of the most capable modern poets we have right now. Some of it brutal, some of it hateful, some of it heartfelt, it\u2019s deep, and his ability is without question. Very well-known is his Lose Yourself. One of the most inspirational, I can do it, songs ever written. Eminem isn\u2019t bitching about his background here, he isn\u2019t whining about circumstances. He\u2019s acknowledging the sweet nervousness of the pressure to perform.  I cannot grow old in Salem's lotSo here I go is my shotFeet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got A song about seizing opportunity and grabbing life by the balls. The last lyrics in the song are \u201cYou can do anything you set your mind to, man\u201d. While Green Day strolls down a Boulevard of Broken Dreams. Makes me fucking sick to my stomach. But Eminem\u2019s great songs are so many that it\u2019s hard to list them all. Rap God, Survival, till I Collapse. So many others. This persists to this day, I still love Rap, still listen to it frequently, it\u2019s not \u201cblack\u201d music, not anymore. It\u2019s strength music, personal ambition music. Personal revelation music. How can you not hear Meek Mill\u2019s Ima Boss and not get charged up?  I listen to this as I drive back to school the first day of every semester. I listened to it before meeting clients when I was a consultant. Getting ready for a fight, rolling into the arena. On the way to somewhere like that, crank Ima Boss and I\u2019m in the mood conquer. \u201cIma king, where\u2019s my mothafucking crown\u201d is what I want to hear before I take on a new challenge. There\u2019s power in this music. In addition to rap and classical, and metal. I am an unrepentant jazz fanatic. Coltrane being my drug of choice. I\u2019m at the end of day, with my girl, and things are quiet, it\u2019s Coltrane and the other greats I\u2019m reaching for. In a Sentimental Mood says everything that needs to be said, without saying a single word. Just listen to this track and try not to be transported:  Or Soft Lights and Sweet Music, which feels like an old jazz club. With high-quality whiskey, and dim lighting. The chill after the work, the club after the win, that\u2019s what Soft Lights and Sweet Music feels like to me. Skill, so much skill that it\u2019s hard to describe. Coltrane had a comparatively short career, but he crammed so much greatness into it that it boggles the mind.  It\u2019s not just Coltrane though, as great as he is. What about Miles Davis\u2019 and his work in Flamenco Sketches:  Kind of Blue is one of my favorite jazz albums. This is another song that is all about nighttime, the end of the day. Relaxing and thinking. Dim lights and a good book, or a tablet for math, just time with yourself of those whom you care about. There is complexity here that is gilded by the calm, which is true of all the great jazz. I could go on, Thelonious Monk, Hawkins, Parker. It\u2019s a long and capable list of musical greats. But while rap (and certain metal) charges me up, and makes me ambitious, jazz is what calms me at the end of that effort. There is duality in this taste, but it feels right to me, that\u2019s for sure. Thanks for taking this musical journey with me, and thanks to Emily Fisher for bringing this question to my attention with her answer and my long comment. ",

            "answer_text": "My main genre of music (to sum up simply) is Rock. I listen to almost all genres of rock from the 60\u2019s to today. I personally think rock music is the perfect combination and point between all genres in almost all aspects. For me: Pop is usually too soft for me and too simple. Extreme Metal can be overbearing for me and hard to really understand and enjoy. Rap is too focused on vocals and usually doesn\u2019t have good instrumentals (However I do like Beastie Boys and Rage Against The Machine who are both rap-rock) Electronic sounds too artificial and overproduced with not much soul in it RnB sounds kind of boring and doesn\u2019t usually keep me interested Classical has nothing to hook me in and doesn\u2019t really have many modern techniques, it\u2019s essentially a more basic and more musical (as in fully focused on chord progressions and melodies over anything else) form of basically all other music. I have nothing against these genres, these are just my reasons I don\u2019t enjoy them as much as rock. If you do enjoy these genres, that\u2019s great and it\u2019s good that everyone likes different things. From the 60\u2019s (which I haven\u2019t listened to that much of) I love The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin\u2019s earliest stuff. From the 70\u2019s I love Black Sabbath, Queen, The Clash, Van Halen, AC/DC and Aerosmith From the 80\u2019s my favourites are Metallica, Guns N Roses, Red Hot Chilli Peppers (yes I know it\u2019s surprising they started in the 80\u2019s), Bon Jovi and INXS From the 90\u2019s I really like Nirvana, Queens of The Stone Age, Muse, Weezer (currently my favourite band of all time), Green Day, Rage Against The Machine and Jimmy Eat World From the 2000\u2019s the bands I like most are Arctic Monkeys, The White Stripes, The Black Keys, The Strokes, The Killers, Jet and Tenacious D And finally, my favourite bands/musicians of the 2010\u2019s are Royal Blood, Des Rocs, Ghost, Jack White, King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, Greta Van Fleet, The Struts and Gary Clark Jr Also if anyone\u2019s wondering, here is my current favourite songs of all time: Death on Two Legs (Dedicated To\u2026) by Queen 2. Say It Ain\u2019t So by Weezer  3. Let It Be by The Beatles  I hope some people got some good recommendations from my post or even just see why I love almost every form of rock, Good day to you all!

            "answer_text": "I grew up in a household with very diverse parents in a very diverse lifestyle. As a military kid I moved everywhere, born in Cali I got my roots from my Mexican mother who is just too cool she opened my eyes to my Mexican Culture and the culture of the 90\u2019s scene as well as the ranchera and Banda. As a teen she was rebellious and did the things teens did, went to tons of concerts and rode around California in a van visiting cemeteries and anything else she saw that was cool. Because of her I love bands like no doubt and sublime and even some heavier stuff I can\u2019t believe she likes ( I do too). She introduced me to country and metal. My father as of now was in the military and so we moved around a lot I missed out on a lot but learned so much from the lifestyle. I was partly raised in Cali but brought up in Hawaii where I got a real taste of jawaiian and reggae, Hawaiian soul too. I learned hula and spoke the language and played the ukulele and ipu. We then moved to Georgia and from there I spent time in Texas. I\u2019ve lived every where long enough to appreciate all kinds of culture and music. I have a fondness for oldies from the mixtapes my dad made for my mom. And I wish I lived with the rat pack so I could see them live at the sands (I lived in Vegas too). Don\u2019t even get me started on old school rap, I\u2019m talking real like cube and slick rick and ice t. And you know pac and biggie. I look like a Mexican marlon Brando metalhead cowboy, if you get that. I have a couple hundred dollars worth of records sitting next to me that I play every night to sleep. I literally love and live every genre of music. Even the obscure stuff. ",

            "answer_text": "As a teenager I listened solely to the rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, hard rock, and heavy metal of the time (1976 to 1981). When I was 16 I began playing the electric guitar, and I spent all of my time trying to learn the songs I loved by bands like Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Ozzy era Black Sabbath, BTO, The Guess Who, Nazareth, George Thorogood, etc. Shortly after starting to learn guitar I was fortunate enough to make friends with a guy that had been playing guitar for about 5 years already, though he was a year younger than me. He taught me some blues scales and the basics of the 12-Bar Blues. He was playing a strange set of scales one day as we sat playing the guitar together. I asked him why it sounded different from what he had been showing me up to that point. He told me that he was playing Classical scales. I asked him why he would be playing Classical, since he liked the same music as I liked. He told me that, basically, Classical music was (much of) heavy metal and hard rock music played by an orchestra instead of electric guitars. I thought he was pulling my leg and I laughed at him. He assured me that he was serious. He challenged me to get a few records of Classical music and listen to it closely, while trying to imagine the music being played by electric guitars instead of cellos and violins, etc. I had never really paid any attention to Classical music before, having decided it was boring as hell. I decided I had to see if I could hear what he was telling me. I bought three records - a Bach, a Mozart, and a Tchaikovsky. One by one I played them and listened closely to the notes. I was astonished to find that my friend was absolutely correct - I could hear the similarities to the heavy metal and hard rock I was listening to at that time. This experiment started me down a road of music appreciation that would likely never have happened, or would have been greatly delayed, had I not met this friend and been encouraged to broaden my horizons. I began listening to all the old blues legends of the early 20th century, and I began to listen to jazz music. I began to listen to classical music and folk, Indian sitar music and Middle Eastern stylings. I even ventured into the old country music that had always caused me to break out into hives within one or two notes prior to this awakening, and found that I liked a lot of that music, too. I fell in love with Boogie Woogie, Do-Wop and Barber Shop Quartets, Ragtime and 1930s jazz giants like Cab Calloway, etc. I became obsessed with Buddy Holley, the entire Beatles catalogue, and all of the 60s \u201cHippy\u201d music, like Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell and Simon & Garfunkel, as well as 60s rock, like Jimi Hendrix, Deep Purple and Cream. I discovered Motown, funk, and R & B, and loved it all. Today there is very little music that I do not like. I have a hard time dealing with most Hip-Hop and Rap, but there are certain tracks that I like in those genres, too. I don\u2019t like modern country, but still listen to pre-1970 country once in a while. Other than that, anything goes. I can get into most music and enjoy it thoroughly. I am thankful that I met this friend, and I am thankful for the never-ending gifts that I get to this day as a result of that friendship and what I learned from him that day. I encourage everyone to venture outside of their usual musical preferences to see if you, too, can begin to appreciate and enjoy the rich palate that is available today. EDIT: Here\u2019s a video of a young boy named Brendan MacFarlane that just amazed me with his natural born talent for the blues. I hope you\u2019ll enjoy it as much as I do.  ",

Classic metal is good, too, provided its solo has some sort of melody (specifically the solos. If you\u2019re going to set aside a full minute for the guitarist to impress people, it might as well add something to the song, not just be there). I like all forms of classic rock, but I really like psychedelic/acid rock (Cream, Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, etc.), as well as hard rock (Van Halen, Led Zeppelin, Guns N\u2019 Roses), and progressive rock (RUSH, Gamma, David Lee Roth in the Skyscraper years). As far as other music goes, I like blues (Clapton is God), Jazz Fusion (Jeff Beck, Miles Davis\u2019 Bitches Brew), and reggae (taking pop song progressions and using muted hits and upstrokes to turn pop into reggae is wicked fun). As far as metal goes, Megadeth is where I draw the line (aside from early Black Sabbath, before metalcore got ridiculous). And Prince is as far as I\u2019d ever go into pop music. ",

From the mid Sixties onward the mysterious world of Psychedelic Music leapt onto the Pop Music scene with an urgency and subtlety hard to clearly define. It was almost what was excluded from it determined more of what it actually was.  Bands like The Jimi Hendrix Experience, The Jefferson Airplane, The Electric Prunes. Some good, some not so. But a very cool, open vibe exsisted for awhile. It quickly passed, but the influences it brought can still be seen today if you look close enough.  The artwork of those times was AWESOME! Focused in areas such as California, Detroit, London etc. Five very famous artists, and a handful of others shaped the Psychedelic Experience with sketches, oil, and eventually Digital Airbrush, in an exciting visual landscape. You knew the music by how it looked, as much as how it sounded.  The Famous Five artists above: l-r Alton Kelly, Victor Moscoso, Rick Griffin, Wes Wilson, Stanley Mouse. And don\u2019t think it ended there! Psychedelic Music is alive and well today! Not only in influences, but in reality too. Groups like \u2018Tame Impala\u2019, \u2018Queens of the Stone Age\u2019, and \u2018A Perfect Circle\u2019 continue to mesmerize audiences worldwide, with great new psychedelic sounds.

            "answer_text": "My preference for music listening is classical music broadly conceived, running from chant up through contemporary composition including electroacoustic music, but this answer is too simple. It's better to say I prefer art music from any time or place, that is to say, music that is made just to be listened to for its own sake, and that rewards undivided attention. The boundaries are hard to draw, but for me this includes much Indian, Chinese, Arabic, and Japanese music, most classical music, most electroacoustic music, most jazz, some rock music, some country and bluegrass, some hip-hop, some electronic dance music, some New Age music, and a fair chunk of what gets labeled \u201cambient\" or \u201cexperimental\" music. Out of all this stuff, if I had to pack 500 albums for exile on a desert island, more of it would be classical music than any other style. To some extent this just reflects what I grew up with, what I played, and what I know best, but I think anyone familiar with global music history would recognize that there is really something great going on with classical music. But to go back to what I said about other styles, I think any time you find a style made by grown up people who are really dedicated to making music and who expect people to really listen to it, it's probably worth giving it a chance and seeing if you can learn to hear it. That doesn't always come naturally, but I find it's almost always worth the effort. ",

I discovered that only recently and find so many bands who present a very interesting mix of electronic landscapes, rocking guitars and jazz influences. I can barely describe that level of fascination. Kraut Rock was not an actual genre itself early on since it was a taunt for German music given by the British over their disdain by Nazi Germany which was not Nazi Germany at that time anymore. Which makes the term even more mysterious or tedious, pending from which side you look at it. But lately the term Kraut Rock has become an accepted label or umbrella term that includes German rock music that was different from rock music from that time being. Early to mid 70s is when this \u201cgenre\u201d spawned many bands that unfortunately only existed a brief time. But in terms of numbers, it seems there was quite a lot going on. Like I said. This interesting mix of electronic landscapes - like done by Cluster, slapped into some nice fusion, which means rock music with loads of jazz influence. That truly created something unique for as long as it lasted. And it was only until recent years people begun to dig it up once more and appreciate it on a more global scale. some Kraut Rock bands also included influences from Indian Ragas which made it more mysterious and ominous. That means temporarily Kraut Rock is my favorite genre as I explore it as well as similar forms of music. I can say this once more broadened my taste in music. ",

            "answer_text": "I have quite broad tastes in music and I honestly cannot say which is my absolute favourite. And it really depends on what sort of mood I\u2019m in at the time. I listen to a lot of extreme music (Black Metal, Death Metal, Grindcore, Hardcore Punk, experimental, noisy, electronic, dark, industrial-type music), which seems to grab my interest more than anything else at the moment. However, I also have playlists that cover other genres (Rhythm & Blues, Ska, Two-Tone, Rock & Roll, Jazz/Jazz Fusion, Classic Pop/Rock, Classical etc.), as well as playlists that are a deliberate mix of all sorts of genres, because I like odd mixings of styles. I\u2019ve also recently created a number of nostalgia playlists that not only feature songs I heard when I was a child in the 1970s (before I became a teenager), but also theme music from some of the TV shows I watched as a kid. I go over to a friend\u2019s house most weeks, to hang out and do some carpentry in his workshop. He\u2019s 54 and I\u2019m 51, so it\u2019s fun to play these nostalgia playlists and remember all the songs and TV shows. ",

            "answer_text": "This is entirely opinionated. And probably nowhere near the truth. So don\u2019t get triggered, please. Best or Favorite? The best in my opinion is definitely classical. Which is also my second favorite genre. I may be a bit biased, as I\u2019m a classically-trained musician, but classical isn\u2019t boring if you just take the time to try and appreciate it. It definitely isn\u2019t something only your grandparents or the elders would listen to. There three main periods in classical. The baroque, classical and romantic, each with wonderful pieces. Most of the composers you\u2019ve heard of are mainly in the romantic era. Chopin, Liszt, Beethoven, Mozart and many more. However, my favorite would have to be rock and roll. Just rock and roll in general. Of course, there are subgenres that I prefer, but everything about rock is great. My personal favorite main sub genres are alternative at first, hard rock second, and heavy metal third, which all three have subgenres under them too. Alternative have great bands like Linkin Park, Green Day (which I don\u2019t actually listen to, but heard that they\u2019re great), My Chemical Romance (no emo is not a genre you ignoramus), Three Days Grace, Evanescence, Breaking Benjamin, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and the list of good alternative bands isn\u2019t even completed. Heavy Metal includes bands like Metallica, Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Slipnot and a lot more. It\u2019s definitely an amazing genre, which I recommend you to have a listen. Hard rock includes classics like Queen, Led Zeppelin, Guns n\u2019 Roses, AC/DC, Aerosmith. So yeah, wow I did ramble a lot. Sorry for wasting your time lmao. ",

I\u2019m fascinated by silence (or empty space) and how a particular disturbance can cause that silence to change into a kind of creature that can be heard with the ears, seen in the imagination and felt with the heart. Every sound creation reflects the soul of the artist. Just as an aside, try to find silence. It\u2019s a rare thing in this world and becoming rarer by the day. I predict that in years to come, people will place a higher value on silence than they will on sound. We already have aural overload in many places in the world today.

When i'm in a neutral mood I go for Jazzy Ballads, Slow Swing, or dark sounding classical music. When i'm in a good mood, i'll go for metal or old school hip hop. And at random times i'll listen to soul and R&B. All of it's good, and there's hardly any bad music, it just depends to ones mood and tastes. ",

I've heard a fair amount of metal my whole life but it's only stuck to me properly the last year (I'm 13) I find it soothing to listen to particularly aggravated musicians, but also the beautiful melodies some bands create. I love the creativity of it all- especially just looking at some prog metal But I like alot of genres. Country I quite like, it's got the traditional drum and guitar setup I respect. I generally don't like (alongside many others) music that's mainly based on computers, but I have a soft spot for rap. It's more respectable, being so focused on vocals ",

Bits of production by MF Doom, Madlib, Kanye West, 6ix; tracks tagged jazzhop, lofi; and whatever else have you. In constrast, there here are quite a few classical- and romantic-era pieces that I do enjoy as well; Tchaikovsky and Richard Wagner\u2019s works, for example. And who am I to say I don\u2019t enjoy my fair share of funky, groovy stuff as well, from old-but-gold tracks you\u2019d imagine being featured on GOTG\u2019s next soundtrack, to Bruno Mars\u2019 latest chart-topper?

As my knowledge grew, my tastes started to encompass symphonic music and later chamber, though I was a latecomer to Opera. More latterly I have come to appreciate other genres such as (selective) Jazz and (selective) popular. I\u2019m afraid that \u201crap\u201d does nothing for me whatsoever, and I would still have to say that the broadly \u201cclassical\u201d spectrum is my vastly preferred medium. However, that is largely reflective, no doubt, of my classical upbringing, subsequent conservatoire training and ensuing career. ",

But I am also a certifiable Gershwin freak, am nutty for West Side Story, and I used to sing in an a cappella group (Sam Robson is un-freakin-believable). So I can get into any of those types of music when the urge strikes me. At the end of the day, if its good quality, music is music. ",
