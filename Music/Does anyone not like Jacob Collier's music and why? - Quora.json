            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s my personal opinion. I like some of his songs and I generally enjoy watching him break down his material. That being said, I think there are two potential issues at play here, which kind of go in sync. The first one is taste and the second one is the reaction he\u2019s getting. Let me try to illustrate this a bit. I agree with many comments made about his music such as, \u201che throws everything but the kitchen sink.\u201d But there\u2019s a bit more to it than that. A lot of my favorite musicians have Experience playing in ensembles and have a good intuitive sense of how to \u201cserve the music.\u201d This is a bit of a different orientation than someone who does everything by himself (I.e. Jacob) seems to have. I wonder what would happen if he spent some time playing in the rhythm section in an ensemble which was not dedicated to his work, and if that would influence his attitude at all when creating his own songs. For instance, if it would have an effect on his musical choices or tastes. As a musician and arranger myself, I think that talent is one thing, taste is entirely another. Ideally, you use your talents as a palette to select from, which is a demonstration of taste. Example: when I listened to Moon River, I enjoyed it up until the big part when he just goes haywire with the harmony. And I personally wonder how much of it is actually him making tasteful decisions and how much is him just flexing his creative muscles. So there\u2019s a bit of a taste issue here. But the more concerning thing for me is the hype. The near constant praise. Saying he is the best talent ever to come along. That is not healthy for a musician\u2019s ego, because it can get in the way of their growth. People are often influenced by what I call \u201cthe Wow Factor.\u201d If you see a seven year old violinist play Paganini perfectly (lookin\u2019 at you, Twoset), how much of your reaction will be judging them by their age and facility and how much of your reaction will be judging their interpretation as you would any other musician? See what I mean? A lot of people seem to be stuck on the WOW that they get from his music and that wow becomes the key to him winning Grammys, earning praise and adoration, etc. A seasoned musician/arranger knows that talent isn\u2019t everything. What Gets you paid is learning to listen carefully to what the song needs and exercising your creative faculties to deliver it. But anyway, the other thing that people might be annoyed about is that he doesn\u2019t Earn a lot of criticism except on Reddit and Quora forums. He also paints a very rosy picture of music and of life (Just check out his videos and photos and look at his smile, for instance. I find it extremely rosy.). For me it leads me to wonder if he\u2019s ever suffered, either professionally or personally. So many of my favorite musicians had to struggle and go through numerous failures, flops, insecurities, etc to get where they are today and they therefore don\u2019t have this BS rosy approach that Collier seems to have. But Jacob Can put out a song and BAM! Everyone reacting like he\u2019s the next Bach. Of course he has this rosy picture of music! Why wouldn\u2019t he? My theory is he probably hasn\u2019t gone through the trials and heartaches of music that Many people do. And it\u2019s especially frustrating for those who have gone through these challenges, and who also have immense talent, to wonder why Jacob is famous and they aren\u2019t, despite their struggles, challenges, etc. So in summary, I think he would do well to play a supporting roll in an ensemble. Stop being a soloist for a couple days or weeks. Learn to listen. Learn to serve the music. Learn that it\u2019s not only about him. And in order to do that, it would help for him to not have everyone that hears his music call him a musical messiah and compare him to Mozart. Combine that with some personal struggles (depression, anxiety, heartache, etc.) and some blunt commercial criticism and see what happens. And again, all this rosiness just annoys me. Life and music is not all rosy and I think people largely buy into his rosy picture, because they want to believe in it. It\u2019s more hopeful than facing how it really can be as an artist. But again, when everything you do has been met with unanimous praise and you have no limits on what you can do creatively, why wouldn\u2019t you think about life and music any other way than he has?

            "answer_text": "Jacob Collier makes corny music. German term kitschig describes it best. I feel uncomfortable listening to his music. Obviously it is a matter of taste if you like him. I like him as a solo instrumentalist but his pop/love songs are disturbing there is zero originality. His voice reharmonization are annoying, he is like a music scientist. Honestly i really can\u2019t understand why he is so hyped. His lyrics are so corny. It is zero authentic it\u2019s cringeworthy it just a feeling that I have. I mean for example Billie Holiday got rid of vibrato and that was a new exciting thing to express more with less. Jacob Collier is the extreme opposite he achieves to express nothing by using every stylistic device trying so hard. I don\u2019t wanna be to mean. He is not a subversive artist and all his embelishements are seriously destroying every song. I mean leave some space for imagination. I seriously hate him/ can\u2019t understand him and he doesn\u2019t serve music for the purpose of good music (considering it\u2019s pop) or good art (considering it\u2019s jazz/classic (not pop)). The most thing that annoys me is that he is so acclaimed amongst musicians that\u2019s why I even bother anyways. And what also triggers me is that how can you be such virtuos of a musician and still make music shittier than people who can\u2019t sing or play even close as good as you.. And use your real voice goddamn not head voice all the time. Another aspect he is lacking (in terms of jazz) is coolness. Like playing with your back to the audience or just triying to be controverse in any way possible. That aspect is totally lacking in his music. He is like this nerdy kid that\u2019s get overexcited that he found a chord with 36 tones. I think beeing caught up with the microtonal tuning of two chords in your composition so 3 music students on youtube can analzye it and jerk of to this crazy new invention is not what music or innovation is about. I don\u2019t have a problem with microtuning two chords but with Jacob Collier it seems like everytime he is sacrifitcing the bigger picture for some minor detail. So to sum up he is not cool, not subversive, has no melancholic aspect whatsoever, zero orginality, kitschig as hell, he names his albums like volume 1, 2, 3, and goes to the stages wearing a monkey costumes. But he is a virtuoso, can speak really well about music (theory) and is a phenomal soloist or musician. He started appealing to a particular audience of musicans and \u201cadvanced\u201d music listeners and was able to somehow make the transition to a more mainstream audience over time. I guess there was a need for somebody like him. At the end it is a matter of taste and this a completly subjective opinion. It\u2019s interesting to see that he was a musical prodigy as a child and so on and the reason i dont like him is probalby attributed to the fact that me and him just have a different taste in music overall.
