            "answer_text": "I wouldn't consider myself upper class exactly, but it has always seemed to me to be in poor taste when people are listening to most of said music in the wealthy suburbs where I have lived at different times throughout my life. Listening to poor, uneducated people describe their poverty and desparation while not understanding just how deeply entrenched in poverty they are, then proceed to ironically boast about how poor they are by claiming to be cash-rich and have/do other things that dont equate to actual wealth or power. Listening to this as a form of entertainment it seems cruel and sadistic. Just as well it can be very hard to relate to when you have grown up with the best possible education in a sheltered white world and learning how to create/generate actual wealth and not just stockpile cash. When you know a world of nothing but privilege, the whole world around hip-hop and rap is simply puzzling. Of course, in this day and age this genre of music has expanded to include all manner of people from many backgrounds, but in its infancy especially in the eighties and the nineties it all represented something totally alien to upper class society and often still does.

Upper Class pride themselves on their taste. Why? I'm curious to know the reason behind this. In large measure, it\u2019s probably a matter of exposure. If someone didn\u2019t grow up listening to rap at home, they may or may not gain exposure to it later. So it\u2019s not even necessarily a matter of \u201cpriding oneself on taste\u201d. If anything, that kind of attitude would be considered \u201cunclassy\u201d. That said, the fact is that especially if there is a classical musician in the family, a large part of their musical diet is going to be classical music. In extreme cases, they may grow up seriously believing that all adults listen to classical music - that non-classical music is for young people. There is also the problem that some rap artists are kind of ruining it for the rest of them, in that there are some who use obscene or violent lyrics. This is no longer even a matter of taste. ",

Upper Class pride themselves on their taste. Why? I'm curious to know the reason behind this.\u201d I think the bigger question is why anyone knows about hip hop, or listens to it. I mean, I saw most of the latest and greatest performers on the Ed Sullivan show, but I don\u2019t recall any hip hop. The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour had musical guests, but I don\u2019t recall any hip hop. I didn\u2019t even see any hip hop groups on Dick Clark\u2019s \u201cAmerican Bandstand.\u201d In grad school sometimes a restaurant or bar would have M-TV music videos playing on a big screen on the wall \u2014 I don\u2019t remember any hip hop there. So, where would anyone have ever have encountered this style? ",

Like religion, musical tastes often have a lot to do w/ what you grew up with, not logic or virtue. I remember well that my father heard something I was listening to and asked rhetorically - and as a put down - where that performer would be in twenty years. It was Eric Clapton. Meanwhile, most of the music he preferred from the mid 30\u2019s to mid 40\u2019s proved to be a lot more ephemeral than Clapton\u2019s. So chill. ",

The same with David Bowie. Rap music is a special case because of its emphasis on Poetry and Rhythm, rather than Melody and Harmony. It\u2019s a new art form. It\u2019s typical \u2014 anything new is lost on the older generation. Expect your children\u2019s generation to come up with Art Forms that are totally new. ",

I would certainly give a Biggie/JayZ cover album of 70's hits (or newer music in that classic style) a listen. ",
