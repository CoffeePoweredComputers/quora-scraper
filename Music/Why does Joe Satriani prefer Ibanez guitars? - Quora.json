            "answer_text": "Joe Satriani first endorsed the Ibanez 540 Radius in 1988 because it suits his style of play. The Japanese made R540's are very high quality  guitars which is still a great value if you can find a used online : for usually around $500 Ibanez went on to build Satriani a custom JS model built to his preferred specifications.  There is a wide range of current JS models available from lower end JS140 for $700 to the top shelf model the JS2450 which can be had for around $2500. Joe started with the radius 540 due to its excellent quality, durability-playability not to mention the reasonable price. Before Joe became a superstar guitar god he was just a virtuoso touring guitarist I would bet that cost was a relevant factor. I personally owned a Ibanez R540 in the early nineties. Its a highly versatile guitar thats has an excellent feel and sound even when not plugged into an amp! The r540 has a thin neck : \"ultra\" which is perfect for fasting playing techniques such as sweeping. Additionally, the guitar has a trem-setter tremolo system that is very similar to a Floyd Rose system. The trem-setter is great for extreme divebombs, gargles, and scooping techniques. The guitar stays in tune due to the double locking nut tremelo system. Ultimately, for a well known guitarists its a good thing to have guitar endorsement deal.  Satriani was able to take it further when Ibanez agreed to create a signature series in his name the JS model. Joe stated in interviews :  \"They (Ibanez) really feel  like the ultimate instrument to me\". Perhaps, his commission checks on these guitars is also quite fair?  Joe stated in an early interview with Steve Adelson:  \"Ibanez, of course, are my guitars of choice. They've  designed them around every little thing that I need\". ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s because he has endorsement deal with Ibanez, as simple as that. Being an Ibanez endorsee has lot of advantages, he gets one of a kind experimental Ibanez guitars which is highly beneficial for a virtuoso like him, R&D division of Ibanez is one of the best in the guitar industry and is highly beneficial for him because they specifically create guitars that suits his needs and nuances, and it\u2019s not just a one time process, the engineers of Ibanez constantly work to identify flaws in the guitars used by their endorsees and rectify them with each new variant. Ibanez as a company is way more flexible in terms of guitar designs than their counterparts, they aren\u2019t rigid in terms of guitar design like Gibson or Fender, this makes them highly appropriate for virtuosos like Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, etc. When it\u2019s about providing free gear and discounts to endorsees, no other brand comes even close to Ibanez. So that\u2019s why he plays Ibanez guitars. ",
