            "answer_text": "I don't recommend EBay - it's a flea market.  We found that customers nickel-and-dimed us for extras, the customer service issues were ridiculous and the fees were cost prohibitive (be sure you take into account the cost to list books that don't sell).  They changed their model to encourage non-business listers and the quality of the customer and products offered went down. Besides our website, we sell through what I call the \"after markets\":  ABE Books, Alibris, Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Biblio, using Fillz to do the uploads.  I understand The Art of Books provides a similar service, comparably priced. We often recommend customers utilize Bookfinder for price comparisons - it has a good representation of dealers that have been vetted. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on how many rare books you are looking to sell but a couple sites to start with would be Biblio and Abebooks. If you have a lot of books and/or want to sell more frequently then listing on Biblio is nice because it will \u2018route\u2019 (list) your inventory straight to Amazon, Abe, etc. for a very low fee. You can list them on Amazon as well but it a bit more complicated as a seller and doesn\u2019t specialize in rare books. ",
