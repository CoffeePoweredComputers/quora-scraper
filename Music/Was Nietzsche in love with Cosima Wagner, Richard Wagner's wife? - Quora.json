            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think so.  The common consensus of why Nietzsche would possibly love Cosima Wagner was because he referred to her as Princess Ariadne in one his letters about the time of his mental collapse.  I don\u2019t think he referred to her as a Greek goddess out of infatuation, but because he was making a metaphor to the myth of Theseus.  The myth itself is clear only in outline -- all versions say that Theseus arrives in Crete, kills Ariadne's half brother the Minotaur, finds his way out of the Labyrinth with the aid of Ariadne's ball of twine, escapes with Ariadne to Naxos and there abandons her. [1] Metaphorically, Richard Wagner is the minotaur, Cosima Wager is Ariadne, and Nietzsche is Theseus.  In this context, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any evidence to suggest that Nietzsche was in love with Cosima. 1. The Will to Madness ",
