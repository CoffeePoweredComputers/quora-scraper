            "answer_text": "I do not think that Sacha Baron Cohen hates Muslims. I suppose one could conclude that he does, based on his comedic roles, especially his portrayal of idiots like Ali G and Borat (who were both represented as somewhat Muslim, even if not in an outright way). The more outright Muslim role though is probably his role of General Aladeen.  But his playing that character doesn\u2019t make him anti-Muslim, any more than playing Hannibal Lecter makes Anthony Hopkins or Mads Mikkelsen cannibals. That role was essentially a parody of the colorful late dictator, Muhammar Gaddafi.  I would say instead that Sacha Baron Cohen has a hatred towards bigots of all kinds - he portrays bigoted and foolish characters in order to get people to shed their inhibitions and show their true selves. He has lampooned people from different religions - so if anything, he\u2019s an equal opportunity offender. And, if he hated Muslims, why would the \u2018Muslim Ban\u2019 anger him so much?\u00b9  Sacha broke his promise to his wife, and went undercover to do Who is America directly because he was angered by the Trump Administration\u2019s so-called Muslim Ban. That move doesn\u2019t show hatred towards Muslims - if anything, it demonstrates the opposite of that. If you haven\u2019t seen that show, I highly recommend it - watch it just to see a certain Georgia politician, Jason Spencer, make a complete ass of himself, and expose not just his bigotry but also his shapely posterior. Two images were obtained from the IMDB page of The Dictator. ",

Being that Sacha Baron Cohen is a lifelong committed Zionist (longtime member of Habonim Dror) who portrays Muslims negatively, utilizing a common stereotype of an antisemitic, misogynistic idiot, like Borat and Gen. Aladeen of The Dictator, and including the country of Kazakhstan, in his routines. He was sued (successfully) for libel for publicly branding a Christian Palestinian grocer as an Islamic terrorist. How he treated him was despicable, putting his safety and life in jeopardy. And he\u2019s never apologized.
