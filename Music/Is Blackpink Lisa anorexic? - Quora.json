She has also been shown to workout in addition to all the activity she does for her job. She may be very skinny, but she has not exhibited the mindset or behavior of someone with anorexia or other similar eating disorders (she doesn\u2019t avoid eating, doesn\u2019t seem to have body dysmorphia, isn\u2019t picky/obsessive about the food she eats (such as having safe foods or foods she avoids at all costs, etc), isn\u2019t regretful/self hating after binging/eating, and doesn\u2019t seem to pay too much attention to the calorie count of what she eats).
