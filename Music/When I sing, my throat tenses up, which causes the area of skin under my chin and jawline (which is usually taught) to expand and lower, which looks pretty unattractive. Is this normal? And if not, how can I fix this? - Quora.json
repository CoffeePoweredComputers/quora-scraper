            "answer_text": "Your throat should not tense up. Good, healthy singing is created when the air from your lungs is able to pass smoothly and freely through the vocal folds. A tense throat restricts airflow and will cause damage over time. Try inhaling like you are about to sneeze. Or gasp like you are frightened by something. Do you feel that flow of cooler hair on on the roof of your mouth spilling down the back of your throat? That's what your throat should feel like when you are singing. You are likely raising your larynx as you get higher up in your range. Conversely you may also be pushing your larynx down to give your natural more weight. Before you cause yourself damage that will be difficult if not impossible to correct, find a voice teacher. Even if you only take a couple months of lessons! A lot of colleges have student vocalists that teach beginner level skills at minimal cost. Occasionally a skilled vocalist has a slender and elongated neck. Your can often see ligaments on the sides of her neck looking tense. They aren't. Her anatomy is just more visible. If you watch her throat, in the front, you won't see any tension. So there are exceptions but I'm willing to bet that in an untrained singer is more likely a raised or lowered, or both!, larynx. ",
