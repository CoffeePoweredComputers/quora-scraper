            "answer_text": "No. I really don\u2019t think he is and here is why. As a girl who identifies as bisexual, but was closeted for a very long time, sometimes I see those traits and/ or mannerisms in others. (Everyone\u2019s experience in the closet is different though; some have it more difficult than others). But when I see Jin in interviews or just in videos in general, I don\u2019t get the sense that he is gay. I would be very surprised if he was, but I get how people that aren\u2019t familiar with k-pop could come to that conclusion. Many people assume that just because Jin (and the other BTS members) wear stage makeup and \u201cfeminine\u201d clothes, he is gay and is in the closet. However, he, on several occasions, has said that he likes girls, and he sounds 100% sincere. But I digress. Instead of focusing on his sexuality, maybe just enjoy him for the person he is, his music, and his wonderful voice. This man deserves the world istg <3  ",

            "answer_text": "Obviously, no one can be sure, except maybe Seokjin himself. From an outside perspective as a gay person, I see a lot of the things I went through coming to terms with myself in him. In the debut days, he used to overcompensate a lot, but now I see him becoming more okay with himself slowly and letting himself be more feminine as opposed to the image Bighit tried to make him present in the start. He also said himself \u2018I don\u2019t have think\u2019 when asked about women, and named Brad Pitt as his celebrity crush. It seems obvious to me that he probably likes dudes, whether he be bi or gay or whatever. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all if he is gay, but would be more sad for him as coming out would be close to impossible. ",
