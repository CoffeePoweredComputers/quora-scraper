            "answer_text": "All music is copyrighted (under copyright protection) from the moment of creation until a period of time proscribed by applicable law. For example, in the United States music created after January 1, 1978 have copyright protection for the life of the author plus an additional 70 years. For works created earlier or as a work-for-hire, copyright protection may last for more or less time. If you use such music without the copyright holder\u2019s permission in a video, you risk receiving a copyright strike. Crediting the copyright holder is not the same as getting permission to use it. That merely informs viewers whose rights you are infringing by not getting permission to use their music. ",
