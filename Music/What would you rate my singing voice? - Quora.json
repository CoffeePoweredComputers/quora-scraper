            "answer_text": "Well Sara, I just listened to some light singing with a guitar strumming that abruptly cut off at 1:04. If this is you and what you're asking about\u2026\u2026first, you sound very young. 13\u201316, somewhere in there? Here is my assessment, and understand that this is coming from a professional conductor and singer of 35 years. I have sung solo with Robert Shaw, the choral miracle conductor of the 20th century. I have conducted some world class orchestras as well as recording a CD with Dave Brubeck, if you know who either of these people are. If not, time to hit YT! You have a very light yet pleasing sound. It doesn't seem like you're really \u201csinging \u201c; just sort of humming loudly with the guitar. You don't have any proper breath support to \u201csupport and engage\u201d your sound. You DO have a good sense of pitch, although I understand you are trying to emulate the \u201cpop style\u201d, which uses some sliding into pitches. You are singing entirely in what is known as \u201chead voice\u201d, as opposed to a mix of head and \u201cchest voice . These are concepts that I'm sure you don't understand yet, since you've never taken a proper vocal lesson. Am I right in assuming this? All said, it is at this point impossible for me to project what you might achieve, given that you find an Excellent voice teacher immediately (try calling some large University music departments and ask if someone will \u201cassess you in person \u201c. You then must be prepared for MANY YEARS AND UNTOLD HOURS OF PRACTICE to perhaps improve, to whatever extent is possible, your vocal technique. (By \u201cyears\u201d, I mean perhaps 8 or more.) If you study voice in the \u201cclassical method\u201d don't worry, you are establishing a secure technique that will not harm your voice, and\u2026\u2026.after gaining said technique, you can sing any \u201cstyle\u201d of music, classical /opera, pop, jazz\u2026\u2026..but stay FAR AWAY from screaming into a microphone with a rock band. Guaranteed to ruin your voice. If you are able to achieve the above, you will have learned how to sing properly and project your voice without microphones. Professional opera singers do not use microphones. Broadway singers do, and every other pop, county singer does too. Finally, I encourage you to pursue this For Your Own Enjoyment. You have a certain sweetness in your untrained voice. Who knows ? However, I MUST caution you to Never pursue a professional singing career Unless an exceptional teacher (be careful, teachers like to see those lesson fees keep coming) encourages you, or you place well in a fairly important classical competition. There are far too many people pursuing this game; an astronomical chance of any real success, and endless heartbroken people who tried when they should have just accepted singing for fun. Didn't mean to rain on your parade. Just a reality check, I've pretty much seen it all. Best of luck, wherever life takes you, Philip O. Rice ",

            "answer_text": "What would you rate my singing voice?  Six out of ten on the basis of potential. Your voice, and your musical ear, are still untrained. You may not be hearing the mistakes, but irregularities are frequent. Also, your breathing is too\u2026normal. Keep doing the diaphragm exercises until you at least double the duration you can hold a note, especially the low ones, which take more air than high notes. Involve yourself in the piece, don\u2019t just stand there and show off your teeth. You are doing a piece of acting, which includes feeling. This will also help you avoid boredom if you reach the point of having to sing your song daily for months at a time. Stay with the basics, Everything else will evolve as it must. (Just a little advice from Uncle Bob, get out of that stressful relationship. It\u2019s too easy to get the life sucked out of you, leaving you looking like a pi\u00f1ata with all the candy gone. I don\u2019t ever want to say I told you so.) ",
