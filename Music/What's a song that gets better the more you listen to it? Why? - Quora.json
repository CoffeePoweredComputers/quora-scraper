            "answer_text": "I Was All Over Her by Salvia Palth. It's a very dark and ambient sounding song that isn't quantized exactly correctly, making it seem like just white noise the first time you listen to it. But after you listen deeply to the mumbly lyrics and the slow, drunk drums, guitar, and bass, you will understand the song and it's meaning aswell as all the minor intricacies and the beauty of the song. It is my favorite song and I have listened to it more than any other, and that's only while conscious. Whilst sleeping, I've listened to it more than it is fathomable, on repeat every night.  ",

But as time went by, I started listening to it a few more times, and soon enough, I was addicted to listening to the song. The part \u201c They keep talking, I keep walking! Dadeul Blah Blah \u201c was great. To be honest, all of ITZY\u2019S songs get better the more I listen to it, but ICY applies the most, in this case. ",
