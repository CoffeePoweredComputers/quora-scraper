            "answer_text": "It\u2019s hard to answer this while not getting into a very subjective gray area. I am 100% biased for Dylan, but I can explain easily why that is. Before that, though, I\u2019d just like to mention that unlike Dylan, Mitchell never seemed to think through what she said when speaking in public. Dylan, in the other hand, was way too private of a person, and usually wouldn\u2019t bash people who weren\u2019t involved in the conversation (so basically, anyone but him, phisically close people and journalists) because he wouldn\u2019t want to deal with public drama. He never enjoyed his messiah status, and that is crystal clear in his post-sixties interviews and specially Chronicles. This excessive introversion is something that makes him such a mysterious figure, and it reflects highly on what he wrote. And please don\u2019t misinterpret what I\u2019m saying. I\u2019m definitely not saying Dylan was a saint or something, in fact there are quite a lot of reasons to criticize him in his personal life. I\u2019m just saying that as a public figure, he would be careful to not generate drama, while people like Joni Mitchell wouldn\u2019t seem to have a filter. It may be more genuine, indeed, but it opens the doors for her to say a lot more regrettable stuff. And I\u2019d also like to add that unlike many answers here, I\u2019m not using stuff other people said about neither of them as a basis to my answer, and I\u2019m also trying not to use abstract stuff to justify my position, which gets to my next point. Now, what would consider a better artist? Personally, I think Dylan was the peak of what a popular musician could ever be. First off, I hardly believe what Mitchell herself said about him having characters for his songs (which many answers are paraphrasing or mentioning) is real. For starters, Dylan\u2019s work themes have always clearly been the reflex of whatever he wanted to do, and whatever he was obsessed with. This is crystal clear, and it has been the matter of fights between him and his fans multiple times, since even his early obsession with traditional folk music Woody Guthrie-style was just his punctual obsession. Dylan didn\u2019t change much as a person throughout the years (what these fans couldn\u2019t understand), but his passions have. In fact, his core values have always stayed the same. Famous critic Piero Scaruffi even talks about it in his page on Dylan: Dylan's major influences were the Bible, the legends of the frontier and epic poets like Walt Whitman. Dylan's is truly an American myth, devoid of Homer, Dante or Shakespeare; his intellectual instruments are those of the pioneers, of the trailblazers, of the colonists. Dylan is heir to the preachers and the proselytizers of the prairies, not to the dramatic actors of London's stages. Dylan competes against the prophets of ancient Palestine and the vagrants of the Old West. Like them, he was mythological; his music was mythological, the music of a man enlightened by God to guide his people onto the righteous path. And this is very true. For example, Dylan\u2019s work has always been in deep touch with religion, from his early career to nowadays. Of course, his so-called Christian triad of albums are the best example, but albums such as John Wesley Harding and Tempest aren\u2019t far behind. Again from Scaruffi, The key to the interpretation of Dylan's work is religion. From the beginning, from the very first \"talking blues\", Dylan's music has always had a religious essence. Dylan was a bursting visionary who addressed the times in apocalyptic terms, who commented as a universal judge would, who threw mournful condemnations against the forces of evil (\"the masters of war) and who raised gentle tributes to his guardian angels (\"sad-eyed lady of the lowlands\"). The ethical and political perspectives of his times were natural offsprings of the heroic Neo-Christianity of which he was the prophet, the inflexible repository of the truth, and the enforcer of the commandments. Dylan's litanies, whether sung in underground cafes or at impressive rallies, replaced Holy Mass. His message became the new liturgy for a secular society that longed for religious relevance. His writing isn\u2019t random, and neither speaks for anyone but him. Not many people would identify with such religious influences, isn\u2019t it? But not only that, he expressed many times that he didn\u2019t want to be anything else than what he was. In the sixties it was particularly hard to tell this message, but he didn\u2019t want the media attention he was receiving, and he didn\u2019t want to speak for the hippies that listened to him. I can\u2019t think of a single occasion in Dylan\u2019s entire career where his music didn\u2019t express exactly what he was thinking or what he believed. Even songs like \u201cIt\u2019s Alright Ma (I\u2019m Only Bleeding)\u201d, as nihilistic as they may seem at first, fit easily into his beliefs (actually, the morality surrounding songs from Slow Train Coming, specially \u201cSlow Train\u201d, is virtually the same as in this epic, but with the word of God in it), which haven\u2019t changed all that much. So, now moving from Mitchell\u2019s crude and, quite frankly, stupid remark about Dylan and actually talking about their music. Dylan was always pushing boundaries, while Mitchell\u2019s career was very \u201csafe\u201d. Even before his \u201celectric\u201d phase, he always thought very carefully about how people would react to the kind of music he did*. What fascinated him about Woody Guthrie was, first of all, a technique he used with the guitar, adding an extra chord to phrases that usually wouldn\u2019t have that, making the songs more dynamic than they used to be. Not many people talk about that, but the fascination with social movements wasn\u2019t the origin of this obsession. After that, he sang under even death threats from crazy fans during his \u201celectric\u201d era in the mid-60s, then after the motorcycle accident had the guts to give up on his image to become a family father, writing more personal and \u201cfamily-friendly\u201d albums. When everybody wanted him to come back, he was spending time with his family, and would only be back in 1974. Speaking of the seventies, this decade was a ride on his personal stuff. From Planet Waves, you can see that Dylan was a changed man but not everything was right in his personal life (while there was happiness with his kids, he did seem to be a little distant and to be trying things too hard with his wife), and this would all reflect in the next years. Blood on the Tracks is one of the most genuinely painful albums ever written, and Desire continues this ride. One year after the second one, he indeed divorced and the desperation was clear in Street-Legal. It\u2019s no wonder that he found himself again on religion, this time fighting with fans, the media, journalists and people like John Lennon, who criticized and parodied him. This is the only true pattern in his career: he always did what he felt like doing and, because of it, he was always pushing boundaries, even in later albums. Dylan\u2019s writing wasn\u2019t the same throughout the years (and even himself aknowledges that, saying he couldn\u2019t write things like \u201cDarkness at the break of noon/ Shadows even the silver spoon/ The handmade blade, the child\u2019s balloon/ Eclipses both sun and moon\u201d). That doesn\u2019t mean that it wasn\u2019t good. Again, his personal life had lots of influence in his writing. The early albums were an obvious reflect of the writing of Woody Guthrie and traditional singers. Songs that could be taken out of his music and put into newspapers. Then he went more personal in Another Side, showing he was already changing interest, and finally started doing whatever the hell Bringing it all Back Home was. His life was changing, his habits were becoming more and more unhealthy, he was sleeping too little and working too much. Tarantula, Highway 61 Revisited, Blonde on Blonde are the exact portrait of that. The lyrics in those albums are hugely abstract, poetic and complex. The imagery in songs like \u201cVisions of Johanna\u201d (which Gordon Ball, professor from Virginia, had been using as an argument for Dylan\u2019s Nobel prize more than 20 years before he actually received the prize, not to mention an English poet whose name I forgot right now) are described in a perfect symbolism. One of my personal favorites, \u201cSad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands\u201d, is what I consider the best written love song in history, even though Dylan\u2019s love songs aren\u2019t usually that good. With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace And your basement clothes and your hollow face Who among them do they think he could outguess you? With your silhouette when the sunlight dims Into your eyes where the moonlight swims And your matchbook songs and your gypsy hymns Who among them would try to impress you? Anyway, his writing is consistently good. I could go longer on this topic and mention albums such as Street-Legal, Desire, Blood on the Tracks, Slow Train Coming, and the gems in his Bootleg series. Technically speaking, Dylan is an underrated singer, because people can\u2019t seem to care about anything other than his timbre. His range is insane, over singers that are widely celebrated, his technique is consistent (the best examples are Blonde on Blonde and Slow Train Coming). I\u2019m not gonna argue who\u2019s better, but this needs to be pointed. And finally, musically speaking, not considering the electric era which I have already talked about, he has some very complex sounding albums. Desire and specially, at least for me, Street-Legal are absolutely wild. The Rolling Thunder Revue was without a single doubt his best live example of different experiments with music after his electric era, and it sounds very, very good (the album The Bootleg Series vol. 5) is proof that Dylan was already a musical entity in American history. All of these are the reasons why I\u2019m biased for Dylan in this dispute, but\u2026 In the end, it\u2019s a choice. You can choose to prefer Dylan over Mitchell, you can choose to prefer Mitchell over Dylan. What I don\u2019t like is people omitting stuff from either side and ignoring mess-ups from both of them.  *Originally, I\u2019d written that Dylan \u201cthought very carefully about what kind of music he did\u201d, and even though that\u2019s true, I think the way I phrased it now expresses what I\u2019m trying to say way better. Dylan was very careful with his music, but in albums such as The Times They Are A-Changin\u2019 he just wasn\u2019t being honest with the whole protest singer facade. Not by chance, his next album had a different, more personal vibe, and we all know what happened in Bringing it All Back Home. Edit: some people in the comments of this answer have been pointing out the fact that I said Joni Mitchel played \u201csafe\u201d. Well, fair enough, I didn\u2019t express myself in the best way possible. I meant that in comparison to Dylan, she did, and that I just cannot argue with. I mean, I\u2019d argue about even the examples people gave me to say that I was wrong (specially the album Mingus, which I don\u2019t see how that isn\u2019t like something different merely for the sake of being different, like something as Self-Portrait was to Dylan). Indeed, Blue is a great album, and so were Hejira or Clouds and others, but I am 100% sure that none of them had as much edge to go against what\u2019s expected from the artist as All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited or Blonde on Blonde did (and if we\u2019re not considering overall quality or relevance of said albums, I\u2019d say Dylan\u2019s Christian triad is even a bigger shocker. But again, not mentioning albums such as his recent ones on jazzy standards, completely ignoring the pleads for original songs of his fanbase, or the mid-90s ones on blues/folk standards, or even Time out of Mind. Not doind what\u2019s expected isn\u2019t a merit in itself). I mean, even Frank Zappa said he thought he had nothing more to do after hearing \u201cLike a Rolling Stone\u201d.I admit I\u2019m not as much into Mitchell as I am into Dylan, but that definitely doesn\u2019t configure an argument. My wording was bad, my ideas weren\u2019t. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes.... and then yes... and then yes some more.  Bob Dylan is, undoubtedly, one of the most influential, important artists of his lifetime.... a legend in his own time, if you will. He does have a way of capturing a time, a place, a feeling that is unique, distinctive... Dylan. Yet, there is a detachment in his work, a point of departure where he no longer identifies with his own lyrics..... at these times, it is impossible to resist the question \"Will the real Bob Dylan please stand up?\" I buy the assertion that life confounds him, on many levels, and he does his best to work through the contradictions, in his music.  Joan, on the other hand.... also unique, distinctive, influential and legendary... but in a very different way. Mitchell has always plumbed the depths, before attempting to put it all to paper. Her audience is not first and foremost, as she writes, but  I do think, based on personal accounts and the songs themselves, she goes beyond the shallow waters, to immerse herself in not only her own personal experiences, but to reach past personal significance, to write from a place that respects the experiences of her audience. There is no way to accurately predict what any one person is going through, at any given time.... but Joan does seem to be acutely aware that we're all going through \"something\".... basically at all times. She uses her own feelings and experiences to create work that will inspire, enlighten, get the listener one step closer to his/her \"AHA!\" mpment... whether Joni had personally resolved her current dilemma or not.  The ability to hone in, on deeply personal feelings.... then transcend the individual, to write in such a way that the listener feels gloriously translucent, free in a world of emotional depth and feeling... surrounded by gorgeous musical therapy, with chordal depictions that perfectly complement the written word.....this is but one of Mitchell's greatest gifts. Unlike Dylan, Mitchell never flinches. She never averts her eyes. She never takes pride in becoming distracted. She is always open to fresh interpretation; in fact, it appears she revels in it. However, she doesn't allow her need for discovery to supersede her need for connection. One always has the feeling that she has burst beyond this realm, in search of truth and beauty.... and she'll do her best to describe the journey. Dylan is a legend... deservedly so. Mitchell is an artist.... a legendary artist... in every sense of the term. ",
