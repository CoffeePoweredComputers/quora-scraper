            "answer_text": "If you composed it without consciously ripping off someone else; then it's original.   That being said, one also has to have a cultural awareness of what \"exists\" in the mainstream in order to avoid embarrassing releases of something that sounds obviously like something else.  I've written plenty of stuff that wasn't ripped off from someone else, but someone else has written something very similar either before or after me; and they've produced and released it.  So that means I don't dare release any of mine and expect any sort of commercial success.  It's still original, and I'm proud to have written it, but it's only original to me.   THAT being said if you're trying to determine whether or not something you've written has been overly influenced to the point of sounding like it's a rip-off, then that's a tough, grey area.  I've gone back and listened to some of my stuff and discovered \"Oh my god! that's a Mike Portnoy rip off!!\" or \"Good grief that's the exact same motif from Men In Black!\" or whatever.  I might have subconsciously placed those elements in there since I'd obviously heard them prior to recording what I did.  That doesn't necessarily make them any less original, it just makes them less original to mass audiences who might also be aware of those influences.  I try like hell to make things original, but no one can be completely 100% original.  No matter what you write, there's something somewhere that uses a piece of it somehow.  And if there's not now, there will be soon.  It's ridiculous to lock yourself up in a cave for ten years to avoid influence, but even if you did, that doesn't mean that someone else won't write something shockingly similar to what you come up with and release it first.  I'm sure there's an element of frustration in that regard for successful commercial musicians and songwriters.  I, not being successful or commercial, don't have to worry about it much.  :) ",

            "answer_text": "Our brains are somehow similar, so it is almost certain that someone had found that sound combination before and maybe used it. So, I can only give you some advices to make your music sound different: Do not choose common sound patterns. If you have listened to actual pop music, for example, you should have noticed that everywhere there are almost the same background note progressions, the same patterns, and, of course, the drums are almost \u201dcopy-pasted\u201d.If that sound patterns really sound good for you and you need them, add some \u201dunexpected\u201d notes, instruments, some expressive melody etc.",
