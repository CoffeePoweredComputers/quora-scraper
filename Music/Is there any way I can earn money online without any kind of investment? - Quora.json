            "answer_text": "This is how I earned money online without any kind of investment. A few years ago, both my husband and I lost our jobs because the company that we both worked for suddenly shut down. This unfortunate experience led us to make an important decision \u2013 we need to start creating diverse streams of income and never again solely rely on our jobs for income. After some research, we found out that the easiest and quickest way to make money on the side without any investment is to offer a service that people need and are willing to pay for. So, what service should we offer? We had two options: We sell our own skillsWe sell other professionals\u2019 skillsBut, we decided to sell other professionals\u2019 skills in the end. Because it is scalable and we can leverage other professionals\u2019 time. Let me give you a scenario: For example, your neighbor asks whether you would be able to look after their 3 year old kid for a few hours for $200. You say \u201cSure, why not?\u201d So, your neighbor gives you $200 and goes off. Then, suddenly you remember that you had already made plans to go somewhere at night and will not be able to take care of your neighbor\u2019s 3-year-old kid. But you do not want to give up the $200! So, you call your good and reliable friend up and ask her if she would like to look after a 3 year old for a few hours for $100. She agrees. Outcome: You made $100 and did not have to babysit the 3-year-old. Now, imagine if you have 5 people asking you to babysit their children around the same time on the same night. And each of them is offering you $200 to babysit for the night. If you were to babysit the children yourself, you could only babysit one of those children and pocket $200. Not bad. But what if you get 5 friends to help babysit for you and you pay them $100 each? You would get $500 and not even have to babysit one child! In fact, you could even be out watching a movie and pocket the $500! That\u2019s the power of leveraging other people\u2019s time! Moreover, we can free up our time to focus on finding more clients instead of spending most of our time fulfilling the work. We call this little business Service Arbitrage. How it works is that you find in-demand services that are already offered by freelancers at very cheap price. Next, you market the services to people who need it at a higher price. Once you get a sale, you get the freelancer to do the work for you and pocket the price difference as your profit. ",
