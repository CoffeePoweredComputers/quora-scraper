            "answer_text": "Talentless rappers come in all shapes and forms. However,there is no such thing as a talentless rapper though,reason being,they out there,making music,performing and getting paid big bucks for their music. One could argue that mumble rappers like Yung Thug and Xxxxtencion are talentless,based on the way they mumble their lyrics which one can never fully understand in just one listen or several repeat plays for that matter. Having said that,the numbers and the fan base don't lie,right? If Yung Thug is talentless,then why is he a multi-platinum selling artist? Why is his music getting so much airplay and downloads? Surely,people can tell talent from whack,right? The answer lies in his record label and PR and marketing team. A well marketed and promoted product will always be a sure winner even if the ingridients or components that make up the product are horrendous,audacious or downright ridiculous. ",
