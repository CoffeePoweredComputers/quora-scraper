            "answer_text": "If you mean physically, no. If you mean spiritually and emotionally, yes. He recently retired from touring. Sure, he\u2019ll have comeback concerts and all that, but he\u2019s just tired of playing all those hits he\u2019s been playing for forty years. Playing Crocodile Rock for you night after night has killed him inside. A little bit more with each performance. Why have you done this to him? Made him dance for you? Made the light inside him dimly die so that, as a fan of his music, you could make this dancing, singing, piano-playing monkey amuse you? That\u2019s vampirism! Also, he wears a lot of strange wigs. Also, he sends flowers to himself every day. Also, Trump used Rocket Man as a nickname for Kim Jong Un. This name came from Elton John\u2019s song. That\u2019s an interesting Fun Fact. Yes, Elton John is very, very tired. And he will be dead soon. And he can finally rest. He can finally stop performing. He can finally stop dancing. He yearns for this. His soul begs for the soundest slumber. The relief that only death and the grave can bring.  ",
