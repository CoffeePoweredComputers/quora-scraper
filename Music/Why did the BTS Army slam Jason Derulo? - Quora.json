            "answer_text": "He celebrated his #1 on Hot 100 on tiktok by playing the original song when it was the BTS remix that got #1. Had it not been for the BTS collab he wouldn't have got the #1 last week. He also said that he decided to collab with BTS because of their huge fanbase. It is so sad to see people taking advantage of BTS because of their huge fanbase. They are genuine musicians who are into it for music and not some cash grab. So armys got mad; rightfully I might say. ",

            "answer_text": "Please correct me if I am wrong. As we all know that this year, Jason Derulo's Savage Love was a big hit, and people loved it. It was recognized at greater levels when BTS became a part of Savage Love Mix. If you haven't heard it yet, then you must listen to that. It is wonderful. And this can be proven by the fact that this became #1 on Billboard 100 chart!! Just imagine that. So recently Jason thanked all the people for this mix, but I don't know if it was a problem or a mistake, he left out BTS in that thanks giving. Yes, you read that right. So now you can probably imagine (if you know BTS Army well) what would have happened btw them. ",
