            "answer_text": "Hello..I would assume to say yes. To fully agree, No! There are many many music artists that spend a great amount in the light of their day to compose a fitting emotion of feelings. Some are like fictional, some can connect, but it is hard to make the comparison of how one is dealing with the things in their lives, so to place music into a perspective emotional roller coaster ride, can be just as hard. It is like writing but has an alter ego to place the human feelings of emotions into the storyline! That is what music is\u2026.Placing a moment in a time that becomes reasonable to connect!! So some writers seem to write like poets, some pick up rhymes, then if it is just words? Others try drama! Moments of emotions. Some are not meant to be personal..well others either elicit other peoples behaviours other than their own. Some composers and writers just try to write up a script of questions, or create what if scenario's. But it then sets up Music, and Music has either functions in being played to the word responses as lyrics. Then there is Keys to be used! Then this is only why some music writing artists want something that they would like to try. You know, not everyone can just sing some song\u2026well they can but if they did not write it or play the notes for it. Just a short version of a song! Other artists are Taylor Swift, Meghan Trainer, Katey Perry!!! Just fine examples of music! Guys\u2026well Depends on Music and Types..we listen to. We do not necessarily like every song these artists sing either..example Adam Levine! Usher! Flo Ride! I think people that trick themselves into believing they are music artists should follow a book to know the paths. Tough!! Tough to reckon with to make it to the top!! Thia goes out to All those Musical Artists\u2026that stood twists and turns in recording and producing it! ",

            "answer_text": "As far as I\u2019m concerned she has never released a song she truly wrote. She may not have even co-written a song That has been released. I say this cause, sure on her albums you\u2019ll see her name along with 4 or 5 different people listed as song writers. But in reality that doesn\u2019t mean she wrote a word. That just means she made her own Ad-libs to the song, which isn\u2019t really impressive. I\u2019m not an Ariana fan so I\u2019m not 100% certain, but I\u2019m sure there are writers demos of her songs out there if you search for them. A writers demo is pretty much the original song writer makes the track and sings the song like they want the singer to.if the singer likes it, they make an amped up cover and slaps there name on the track. Artists like Celine Dion And Justin Bieber made careers out of it. ",

Yep sometimes big Artists do mange to write for her but she herself as per my knowledge hasn't yet been acknowledged for writing her own songs which are also superhit. However, She has her own big production although she gets music album offers from other big music producers of the industry so that probably indicates she isn't the writer but the singer. Hope it helps. ",
