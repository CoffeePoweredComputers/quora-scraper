            "answer_text": "Not necessarily, but it depends on how you sing loudly. If your loud singing is technically incorrect, you're prone to hurting yourself regardless of whether the music is supposed to be loud or soft. If you're just one of those poor souls who has a \"big voice\" so that even your soft singing carries really strong, then consider yourself lucky. Great \"big\" voices always have trouble with soft singing and must present dynamics in a kind of relative way (i.e., singing softer as opposed to singing actually soft), but this means you'll probably never need a mic for amplification. If it's because the only way you know how to sing is to scream, then yes, I'd say you're prone to damaging your voice. Do you have a voice teacher you can ask this of? If so, that's a much more helpful course of action than inquiring on Quora. We love to be helpful here, but there's not a lot to go in with your question. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what you are actually doing, as to whether you would cause vocal damage. You would need evaluation from someone trained to determine whether you are truly abusing your voice. In general, it is a more of a challenge to sing quietly in a non-breathy way where the vocal cords are connected. That is part of balancing breath management and vocal technique. You would need to learn how to gain that balance so you only sing with the minimum tension required to sing, and keep your voice relaxed and dynamically even at all parts of your range. Adjusting the volume for style and emphasis comes later, after you develop this balance. ",
