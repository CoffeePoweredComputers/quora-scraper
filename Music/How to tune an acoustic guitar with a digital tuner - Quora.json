            "answer_text": "By digital tuner I assume you mean one of those clip on tuners. Well here's how you tune your guitar with it. Step 1: Clip the tuner to the headstock of your guitar and switch it on.Step 2: Your tuning starting from the lowest string should be E2, A2, D3, G3, B3, E4.Step 3: Start with the lowest string. Play the open string and take a look at the tuner. Turn the tuning machine as required. Turn it clockwise if your string is sharp, and anticlockwise if your string is flat. Keep on picking that open string. Adjust till the tuner reads the tuning E2 in green. Repeat this step for all strings. For the A string the tuner should read A2, the D string it should read D3 and so on.Step 4: Once done fret on the 12th fret and play the string once again, ensure that the 12th fret note is exactly an octave apart from the open string tuning. Suppose you fret the low E2 string on 12th fret and play it then the tuner should show somewhere around E3. Repeat this step for each string. Here's the deal, unlike an electric guitar you can't adjust the string saddles on an acoustic guitar. The bridge of an acoustic guitar is extremely primitive, they don't have adjustable saddles. The overtly conservative mindset of acoustic guitar players has kept the elements of acoustic guitars technologically backward and primitive. If the 12th fret note on some strings is not exactly and octave apart from the open strings then you need to take your guitar to a luthier to get the saddle filed and adjusted for those strings.",

            "answer_text": "There are many digital tuners available for you that are both accurate and not expensive. I favor the type of tuner I can clip on the headstock of my guitar. Just turn on the tuner, pick your string, tune it to pitch and then go to your next string. When you are done, I would suggest you check all strings again. It is not uncommon for your Bass stings to often change in pitch while tuning your other strings. If your acoustic guitar has an input jack, you can use digital tuners that you plug your guitar into the tuner\u2019s input jack and run another cable from your tuner\u2019s output jack into your guitar. Choose which tuner is best for you. ",
