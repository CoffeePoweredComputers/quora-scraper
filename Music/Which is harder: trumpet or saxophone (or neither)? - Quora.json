            "answer_text": "Agreed with the previous response. The saxophone can often be easier to get a decent sound out of in a relatively short amount of time while the technique needed for brass instruments like a trumpet requires \u201cbuzzing\u201d. Buzzing (flapping of the lips starting by mouthing the letter \u201cm\u201d, puckering the lips, and then vibrating the lips with lots of air) can take a while to perfect because it involves many more mouth muscles on a trumpet mouthpiece. The saxophone seems more complicated because, as a woodwind instrument, it not only looks like it has more keys to press, but it also requires placing a wooden reed (piece of bamboo) on the mouthpiece in right position to get the best vibration of the reed possible. But once that\u2019s all set up, the saxophone becomes a lot easier to get a sound out of and get around playing a beautiful melody with little effort. As had already been said, both instruments require years of practice to truly master. (I\u2019ve been playing the saxophone for 40 years and consider myself pretty mediocre compared to the masters of that instrument.) In the end, since any Instrument you learn takes a certain amount of dedication that makes you appreciate the skills talented musicians have, it often comes down to a matter of taste. I love the sound of certain trumpet players and can listen to them for hours, but the instrument that happens to speak to me; with a voice and soul similar to that of the human voice in my opinion, is the saxophone. Students who choose either instrument should always remember to enjoy the learning (and playing) process, as well as taking the time to listen to recordings of great musicians known on that instrument for inspiration.

            "answer_text": "Which is harder: trumpet or saxophone (or neither)? Neither. When my middle school students start in band, the single most asked question of all time has been \u201cwhich instrument is easiest to play?\u201d The answer is \u201cnone of them\u201d. All of the instruments are capable of playing all of the notes within their range, and all instruments come to a place where the fingerings/keys/frets/bars start to repeat. Since all of the instruments play all of their notes, they all require some kind of technique. The trade off for woodwinds is generally fewer (or no) changes in embouchure (the way the mouth is held while playing) with more fingerings to learn, and for brass the trade off is fewer fingerings, but more mouth positions. Percussion instruments are easier to play individually, but require the most variety of technique and skill to play all of them competently. Guitars have more strings - violins don\u2019t have frets. The point is all of the instruments require trade offs to play all of the notes in their range. Neither trumpet or saxophone is harder to play than the other. Now - if you had asked about sax and french horn, the horn is harder. If you had asked about bassoon or trombone, the bassoon is more difficult. That is because the trade offs for those instruments are more extreme than most instruments \u2014 the bassoon has more fingerings, and the horn has more lip positions. ",
