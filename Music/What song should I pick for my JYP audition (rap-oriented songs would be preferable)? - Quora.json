            "answer_text": "Picking a song for an audition is difficult. You have to take into account your type of voice, your vocal range, etc. You have to be sure what\u00b4s your vocal capacity so you can show the best of your talent. For example, I would chose Epiphany by Jin(BTS), because it\u00b4s on my vocal range, if I wanted to sing Emotions (by Mariah Carey) would be a bad choice because it\u00b4s a difficult song for me to sing. So chose something you feel COMFORTABLE SINGING. It also depends what you want to showcase on the audition. Rap, vocal or both? And also if you want to sing in korean or english or in any other language. I would reccomend: No Tears Left To Cry by Ariana Grande.- for a showcase more a bit more of singing than rapping Stay by BlackPink .- for both ONCE again there is a possibility for this songs not to be suitable for your voice (or maybe yes, who knows), so chose what you are comfortable singing, this are just recommendations. Good Luck :) Note: Remember that in K-Pop AUDITIONS you usually have around 15\u201345 seconds so i would reccomend chosing the best part, chorous, or climax of the song ",
