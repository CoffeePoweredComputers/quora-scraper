            "answer_text": "To begin with you have to be honest with yourself. People will say just try it and I agree, don\u2019t get me wrong. But you have to really and I mean really look into the company you\u2019re wanting to go into. I\u2019m just going be honest and list what they look for and then list some tips. I\u2019m gonna just go into detail with the big 3 and not the others as much. Unless you are planning on doing a global auditon or a monthly one, you\u2019d probably be doing an online one. There are four rounds technically. 1st round is online audition and you submit it and they email or call you (most likely to email you) that you passed the first round of auditioning and that they want to have a private audition with you. (Keep in mind it could take them from 2 weeks or more to respond but if they don\u2019t respond after 2 months take it as a hint that you didn\u2019t pass) but a girl auditioned online and didnt hear from them and gave up and then they emailed her 3 months later so don\u2019t lose hope.2nd round private autition, you will go to the nearest city (from the stories I heard it would be either L.A. or N.Y.) MAJOR TIP HERE when they record you (you can search up on how private auditions are like, I\u2019m not going to go into too much detail) STARE INTO THE CAMERA (this goes for global auditions too!!!) they\u2019ll send this video to South Korea, and be reviewed and they can\u2019t have you looking around the room, it makes you seem less confident.3rd round is where the technicality come into place, this isn\u2019t a \u201cofficial round\u201d but in a way it is. They send your video to South Korea and the review it and then they decide if you pass the audition or not. They also see if they want you or not and they will let you know soon and will send you an email letting you know your current status (signing a contract etc)The fourth and final round is your trip to South Korea (WHICH IS NOT PAYED HY THE COMPANY) I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s too see if you are really serious and passionate about this. But after you get to Korea they pay for things I guess, I\u2019m not sure because as it\u2019s hard to find what exactly happens after you go to Korea.SM: What they look for: Looks~ this does not mean you have to look Korean or anything this just means you have to have the potentional to be pretty, as in with a little weight loss or some plastic surgery (yes SM does do SOME plastic as you can see from Yuta\u2019s chin from NCT). But don\u2019t let this discourage you. But if you don\u2019t want to do plastic then don\u2019t go here but most likely if you say no I think you\u2019ll be okay.Figure~ SM does care about weight and they are especially seen strict with females rather than males. As you can see from Taeyeon and Wendy especially, as I remember hearing Wendy said something along the lines that she didn\u2019t want to eat the ice cream because her manger was watching and Taeyeon scolded her manager.Talent~ They don\u2019t really look for \u201ctalent\u201d per day but more for the potential to be talented. Like for instance, you could not be a good dancer, singer, or model. But you have the potential to be a good one with some training and hard work here and there, you could become something more and that\u2019s what, in my opinion, they are really looking for.Conclusion~ In the end it\u2019s up to you whether or not you audition. But I highly recommend going to this company! Don\u2019t believe the rumors and go with your gut instinct and the concept you think fits you best! They are usually more successful than any other company, and although the training is rigorous, you can\u2019t expect success without any hard work and payment.Now some randome tips for SM (not in order just random: BE CONFIDENT lots of SM artist mention this A LOT so it\u2019d be quite silly to not listen, and lots of SM artists are confident. Even if you\u2019re a shy person at heart, fake it till ya make it.Like what Joy and Taeyeon mentioned, Joy said she said she made herself seem confident and had eyes that said \u201cchose me\u201d and Taeyeon said she had the look at the end of \u201cWhy\u201d that correlates to this, that at the end of her performance she says \u201cI did well didn\u2019t I.\u201dMake yourself less nervous and be charsmatic!! Make yourself seem like you have the \u201cIdol Aurora.\u201d But don\u2019t try to hard!!JYP: What do they look for: Looks~ They care about looks as much as people try to deny it, they do!! They are like SM but not as strict.(I\u2019m giving up on being organized) Jyp said he likes healthy people, so basically \u201cidol body\u201d ready.Also from the research I did hear that JYP has weekly weigh ins, maybe this has changed, who knows? They also in my opinion more stricter than SM. Which is ironic.JYP also looks for talent rather than looks and as the same as SM looks for the pentipnal to be great.They are likely to accept foreigners but in the end they are still a KOREA based KOREAN company, so if you complain about how they only choose Asian looking people well that\u2019s because their market is based in ASIA. BUT THERES HOPE, the Korean companies are starting to branch into the international level, but that takes time!!! (This is for all companies!!)Also JYP has previously stated that he prefers to have trainees trained from at a young age and that he \u201crarely\u201d accepts older trainees, for instance 20+ etc but that could\u2019ve changed or there could be exceptions etc.TIPS: BE CONFIDENTBE \u201cHEALTHY\u201dHave the potential to be talented.(I don\u2019t know a lot of tips because I mostly researched about SM). YG: I\u2019ve seen in the comments YG getting a lot of love hate relationships. Yeesh. I\u2019m going to tell you now that it\u2019ll be extremely hard for people especially foreign people to get into YG. EXTEMELY HARD!!! Out of an estimated 4000 people with the YG Global auditions only ONE passed the auditions, and that was Lisa. Also another rumor I heard was that they only 6\u20138 male trainees and 9 female trainees (before Blackpink\u2019a debut). Another thing to keep in mind is that the male and female trainees are to never meet basically. They have separate training and eating times and hardly ever interact and I think someone mentioned that the trainees and female artists are recommended not to have a lot of male friends but maybe that\u2019s only for trainees but after debut you can interact with other males, and other male artists. And this came about I believe because of previous scandles. What they look for: Looks~ YG didn\u2019t care about looks before but in a recent interview he said that he is now starting to pay attention to that a lot more. Figure~He, like JYP cares about this A LOT. And they wnat their artist already fit especially in auditions there won\u2019t be much consideration (UNLESS YOU SHOW POTENTIAL BUT THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU HAVE TO LOSE HOPE) they give their artists a personal trainer and dietitian to get healthy and fit! Talent: YG cares about talent a lot, while others looks for potential, he doesn\u2019t so much. He really looks for talented people. Tips: BE CONFIDENT THIS IS KEY FOR ALL COMPANIES!!!Have charisma (again for all companies) give off that \u201cI can do this\u201d or the \u201cCHOOSE ME\u201d vibe without making it obvious/try hard.Practice at home etc really hard and make sure you make your talent stand out.Big Hit: Someone called this company sexist and that\u2019s completely rediculous. With what happened with GLAM (this was a co-managed group). They just never really got into the girl group game. I think I remember big hit saying that they train and deal better with males rather than females. Also they do train females from time to time (companies loan their trainees to big hit to gain experience and trianing). Also with BTS\u2019s success (and I mean they were successful than any other group in my opinion) they possibly didn\u2019t want to risk a sasang into the building. Who knows? But it\u2019s their right to do so, get over it. There are many companies out there looking for talent like you, you just have to try!! That\u2019s all the companies that I\u2019ve done research on, mostly about the Big 3 but after seeing that comment on calling Big Hit sexist, I had to mention it. And if you have any questions be sure to DM me! I\u2019ll respond as soon as I can, and let me know if I got any facts or anything wrong. These are all based on what I found on the internet, this does not make anything true or a postitive way of getting a successful audition but just general knowledge I\u2019ve found that I\u2019d like to share with you all.

            "answer_text": "To brief you on companies, primarily the one I\u2019d personally advise, especially if you are a foreigner, is SM. I know people are probably not gonna like me for this, but let me explain. SM, assuming you have the mindset and the strength and you must REALLY want to be an idol, will take care of you, career wise and possibly financially. Essentially, you are guaranteed instant fame and success. It\u2019s a very prestigious company. They make all kinds of music, bubble-gum pop, R&B, trap(ish), and whatnot. You\u2019re set, if you get in, but you still have to put in 200% percent if you want to debut, so be ready to fight with bloody knuckles. YG, another prestigious company, but it is kinda on a slight roller-coaster down. It has amazing, super-talented, mostly self-producing groups (make their own music). Depending on the style of you\u2019re group, you\u2019re guaranteed success, as well (just not as much as SM) But trainee times are often long, and often after a kpop group has debuted, they really don\u2019t do well in terms of promotions and can keep a kpop group stagnant, not producing any music (even if they have a huge fanbase, prime example, BlackPink, and maybe even Ikon). But they\u2019re super-talented and they\u2019ve produced very familiar faces in the industry that have even morphed into American music (cough Psy cough BigBang cough 2NE1 cough CL). JYP, would be the second best I\u2019d suggest you audition for. They\u2019ve really stepped up their game recently, boast the national girl group (TWICE), not to mention a really talented guy group (Got7), and the boss, JYP, is extremely experienced in the industry. He speaks English, if you are a foreigner, and really values competition. He\u2019s a huge fan of produce shows and that\u2019s often his mechanism for forming groups. Financially, I\u2019m not sure how well they\u2019ll cover you there, but they are on a hot-rise and are doing some really phenominal work from the industry. They\u2019ve just debuted a new group, Stray Kids, and they\u2019re absolutely terrific. They\u2019re also relatively diverse (it\u2019s a kpop company so don\u2019t expect much outside Asia), and a lot of they\u2019re members are from South East Asian nations. There are less popular companies other than the big three, such as Cube, Pledis, BigHit (they only accept male trainees at the moment, but on second thought, they are popular, just not as big as they\u2019re only promoting one group and one artist as of now). I like most of the groups Cube produces, but they don\u2019t reach the same levels as the big three. It would have to take some incredible concept to allow them to gain major traction on the charts. Pledis, is like a baby fusion between SM,YG, and maybe a little bit of JYP, with the exception that some groups don\u2019t get the same instant fame as the big three. Pledis works you just as hard as SM, but is tending to be more open to other nationalities and ethnic origins. I personally wouldn\u2019t recommend them, however. BigHit, they\u2019re really isn\u2019t much information about them, besides the fact that obviously have BTS, the biggest, internationally recognized Kpop group at the moment. The CEO, Bang PD used to work with JYP until he decided to take his own route. They apparently have a formula now, for international stardom and success they plan to use on a new boy group they want to debut (no idea when), but this is another great company that really cares for the artist, possibly the most out of all of the major companies. There are countless other companies, such as Starship, that I just don\u2019t know enough about to give you a gist of, so I HIGHLY reccomend you shop around and do your research. Some tend to have more scandals and legal suits (specifically SM, but that doesn\u2019t affect my opinion on them tremendously, lowkey anyone can get sued, and i wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they got sued a lot, because of the work they do), so do watch out. And most importantly, best of luck! ",

            "answer_text": "JYP: JYP really focuses on talent rather visuals or nationality or race. He takes care of mental health really well, but most of the time he is the cause of the mental health. You must have a good personality over there. I\u2019ve heard there is pretty good food there as well. Make sure you are nice and talented though if you don\u2019t fit standards too well. some artists from there are Twice, Itzy, stray kids and Got 7 SM: I don\u2019t think you really wanna got there. They have pretty harsh training. And they really value their visuals the most. Plus they aren\u2019t fair to people of other nationalities. So if you aren\u2019t Korean, that\u2019s probably a no. They do have good promotions though and a nice fan base. But mental health goes down the hoollleeee. Some examples of Artists there are NCT, Exo, and Red Velvet. YG: mmph. I\u2019ve heard the training there is pretty difficult according to Blackpink. They really value nice talent and they have really, really good rap and nice outfits. But, comebacks there take forever and promotions are not really that good. But YG has his Favorites, and that\u2019s a problem. Plus they don\u2019t protect their artists. Examples of artists over there are Treasure and Blackpink and iKON. Bighit: well bighit has been really busy these days. He\u2019s got ILAND trainees, and is planning to debut a new boy group and some other girl group (under source I think) I think their training is pretty good. But some staff there are very disrespectful. Some are pretty nice and friendly! But bighit does protect his artists. Bighit only accepts boy trainees and some Japanese girl trainees. (I think bighit should do better with ggs tho) I will talk more about the companies under him later. Some artists that are exactly under him is TXT and BTS. Source music: I think they only except girl trainees. Acquired under big hit. I don\u2019t know much about them but I think their managed pretty well due to being under bighit. A group from there example is Gfriend. CJ entertainment: i don\u2019t know much about them, but I think they are pretty good due to being managed under bighit. They will debut ILAND. pledis: hahaha NO. pnation: i\u2019ve heard that they are pretty good with trainees so I recommend! cube: they are ok, not the best though, they are pretty pick and choosy with their promotions (I like both clc and g idle) and they forgot all about clc. I\u2019m not sure why this happened. but they are pretty small. jellyfish: I don\u2019t know much about them, but I think they are pretty good and cool. The artists there seem pretty nice. But they do debut pretty young artists like verivery so you probably won\u2019t get to live your childhood very long. SG: I think they are pretty new, but they seem cool! I think they\u2019ll probably except a lot more trainees because they are so new. It their auditions have deadlines and stuff. Here\u2019s a screenshot I took of their audition page:  Starship: Really, really small. But they do have Monsta x and cravity (I believe cravity will blow up though pretty soon) I guess you could go there if you like. KQ: also pretty small. But they have a really nice, easier ish training system which I heard is pretty cool. I would recommend. Look at ateez for example. Yuehua: don\u2019t really go there unless you are korean or chinese. FNC: hehe. Maybe NO. They are really in the middle of a scandal and probably losing a lot of money. Pray for Mina if you pray. WM: I think they are pretty cool, it I think the diets are pretty harsh. I read that YooA had to sneak eat in the bathroom because she was so hungry. But they seem pretty sweet with oh my girl and onf. RBW: that\u2019s a yes and a yes! They let their artists have freedom and their artists are definitely vocalists. I think they\u2019d be great! I don\u2019t know much about their training though. I don\u2019t know any other companies but I recommend JYP, Maybe YG, cube, KQ, WM, starship, jellyfish, pnation and maybe bighit and source and sg (if you are a boy maybe) your very last choice should be pledis. Maybe Sm. It it depends on your qualities and specialities. byeee! good luck! You\u2019ll never know till you try!  ",

            "answer_text": "You can audition for any company you like, but it really depends on your tolerance level of mistreatment. SM: You don\u2019t want to go here. You have to go through extremely intense training. For example, trainees have to sit underwater in their underwear and hold their breath while instructors drop balls on their stomach. Even after going through all that, only 10% of trainees debut, and SM is known for not treating its artists well. Many of its artists have filed lawsuits against it. JYP: Slightly better than SM but according to one of its artists, during training before debut, instructors punish the trainees for making mistakes by hitting them and shoving them. If your pain tolerance is high I guess you could audition\u2026 YG: Probably the best company out of the Big 3 but is slacking right now. Also, its artists aren\u2019t allowed to date. They can\u2019t even talk to labelmates of the opposite gender. BigHit: Sexist and doesn\u2019t accept female trainees. Pledis: Fat-shames its artists and neglects them. Managers have been seen taking away gifts given to idols for themselves. Some Pledis idols have admitted to crying every night during their time as trainees. Starship: Doesn\u2019t promote its artists or give them legal support. Its idols could be more popular than they are now but due to lack of proper promotion, aren\u2019t as high in the charts as they should be. One of its groups got plagiarised and it did nothing. Cube: Groups disband very often, probably due to unequal profit distribution and biased treatment to certain members. Some other companies that are unadvisable: TS EntertainmentThe Entertainment PascalMBK EntertainmentDSP MediaYou could audition for Fantagio, apparently they treat their artists really well. ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to be treated well (as best they would provide) you should look into the slightly smaller agencies as they are not so intense on their trainees. why you shouldn\u2019t join any of the big three: SM - not a single idol likes it at all. they are the strictest of the all and looks is insanely important, your talent will not really matter e.g. Sehun from EXO isn\u2019t really allowed to show his full potential as SM prefer his appearance. JYP - all though part of the big three they don\u2019t do that great. idols and trainees are pushed to their absolute limits. e.g. Twice have had soo many comebacks that they are not hitting their targets, members are soo tired they need a break. also every bit of credit goes to \u201cJYP\u201d, Got7 had to spend so much time begging jyp to let them create their own music. YG - Comebacks? once in a blue moon, they care more about uniqueness more than talent which sure is good for applicants that aren\u2019t actually good but it means those who have true talent don\u2019t get their break through! basically they are not good if you actually want to show your talent through frequent comebacks. (Jennie from Blackpink said in a VLive that she was really concerned bout the length of time the company took to create music for their comeback/she didn\u2019t think they were going to get one) I advise an agency like Cube or Starship as they have been heard of by many people yet trainees and idols are treated fairly well with some freedom ",

There is a lot of hard work that goes into every comeback, and they don\u2019t neglect their idols at all. They give them artistic freedom and still show success.*Big hit is a good management company. They treat their idols pretty well, and gives them good amount of attention. Bighit Con*They only technically have two groups at the moment, and TXT is already receiving a shorter stick since BTS is so huge everywhere right now. We have yet to see how it can handle promoting more artists and expanding as a company. JYP Pros* Natural, no fakeness. Artists are given freedom to be themselves on variety shows etc, real close bond with JYP himself.* JYP is good at promoting their idols for every single comeback. Every album achieves success no matter how bad it might be. Artists have a creative voice in the studio and are allowed to express themselves more openly with JYP himself.*Is very approachable. The \u201cfriendliest\u201d in the BIG 3. Very human-like. Has good relationship with their idols. Give idols pretty good freedom(not ENTIRELY.) JYP Cons*Depends too much on one person/one idol for the functioning of the group. No individual activities are encouraged. Although songs are catchy, a lot of them sound the same and it gets repetitive.*Concept gets repetitive TOO much. Kind of flops their idol\u2019s golden era(well they\u2019re improving). ",

            "answer_text": "I think JYP. But don't miss out on SM( It's the best entertainment agency) If you would've asked me this question,I would never have said SM but in the current scenario, I think SM has really opened their doors for foreigners. And to the people who are pretty much saying that SM is obsessed with looks , I have some exceptions from you. SM chose Shindong to debut with Super Junior (We all know he's on bullier side) , Amber debuted with F(x) and wasn't forced to change herself or her styling. When Joy debut with Red Velvet she was on a chubbier side as well(This might be controversial,but I'm just comparing with other idols) Ofcourse they do give preference to looks but you might be lucky as well. (Who would miss a chance to be a part of SM family- it comes with a guarantee success). JYP- It's one those chilled out agencies who treat you literally like family and doesn't burden you much. Focuses on talent as well(Exception- Twice) but JYP lacks on promoting their older groups. It just focuses on the new group and doesn't give comeback to the older ones. So be ready with a backup after debuting under JYP. There's favouritism in JYP as well I guess (Suzy and Friends).. whereas SM hates everyone the same. YG- YG is amazing. Like totally talent. If you have it,you got it. But current scenario not that nice.. They gave Blackpink a very late comeback (they are a rookie group,they have to be active). Winner's isn't that active as well. 2NE1 disbanded. PSY and CL left. So , right now it's tough time for YG. ",

It might be the perfect company for u as they usually focus on looks and less talent. But They are especially hard on their trainees so if you can't survive harsh conditions it's not for uJyp ent - talent is more valued rather than looks and I guess they are pretty open to other trainees from other countriesYG ent-completely based on talent looks come after , only a few select trainers make it in and even a few only get a chance to debut so chances of success is lowYou can always try cube ent woolim ent Loen or pledis although chances of fame or success is less it's not impossibleKeep fighting for ur dreams and think about all outcomes after auditioning and training .im not trying to scare you intact I'm scared writing this since it can affect your decision but know the consequences of look for another path start your own YouTube channel or become famous in your own country are some other options but it completely depends on uHOPE THIS HELPED!!!!!",

            "answer_text": "No one can really tell you where you should audition. No one really knows the companies. But from experience of trying out for kpop entertainments, you need to really be honest. You have a chance of making it, but there\u2019s also a chance you won\u00b4t. If you do try out, you need to be able to live with the outcomes. If you get in, prepare for a really hard time of diet control and training. If you don\u00b4t, live with yourself and prepare to do something else. But if you want real facts, I think it depends on where you want to go and how they will treat you. From what I\u00b4ve heard, JYP is 50% based on looks rather than talent. And there are a bunch of scandels including JYP, so if you don\u00b4t want all that, don\u00b4t audition. Bighit most likely will be focusing on BTS and TXT, and I don\u00b4t think they\u00b4re taking in female trainees, only male. YG treats women wrong, and men really don\u00b4t debut much there. The smaller companies probably don\u00b4t get as much views, but go for it if you want to. SM Entertainment earns the lowest amount of profit every year, but the kpop idols there are fairly popular. And also, SM will be willing to take a chance on you, willing to take risks for you. So I auditioned for SM, and so should you. This is just my opinion, but I really hoped this helped! ",

But look at the Idols whose made by SM such as BoA, H.O.T, S.E.S, Kangta, TVXQ, SJ, SNSD, and many more. SM is very strict and hard to their trainees, so if you can get it into SM, you should prepare yourself for a hard time but not the hardest. (the hardest come when you\u2019re debuting lol). SM can accept you even if you\u2019re not that talented or pretty if they see an \u2018Idol Material\u2019 inside you thought.JYP Ent. 70% Talent 30% Look, Some people said JYP doesn\u2019t really care about looks but I don\u2019t think so. JYP made many succesfull idol thought, such as WonderGirls, 2PM, Day6, TWICE (they\u2019re succes even thought they\u2019re kinda..), and look at StrayKids who already got the attention and popularity even thought they haven\u2019t debuted yet. JYP known to be strict to their trainees but not as strict as SM, but yeah\u2026YG ent. 95% Talent 5% Looks, Many people said YG really doesn\u2019t care about looks but it\u2019s impossible. Even if only 0.99% but they still care. YG also known to be strict to their trainee and idols, take a look at how they\u2019re not letting iKon to meet BlackPink, they\u2019re strict, but it\u2019s good for the artist\u2019s career. YG is really selective on accepting trainee and debuting idols, so the chances is kinda low.I think the agency who really openned to foreigner is JYP, even thought I\u2019m a SM stan lolol ",

            "answer_text": "Reading the answers just a few comments. SM - not the monsters they\u2019re made out to be and they care about talent a lot - if you don\u2019t have it they won\u2019t pick you. Looks are important but they believe raw talent can be refined. Their problems with foreigners is in the past - EXO - M members (except Lay) left because they used SM to get exposure and then launched their careers in China. My daughter is a trainee there and loves them (and since I didn\u2019t marry a Korean she\u2019s only 1/4 - she\u2019s also 1/4 Chinese though and a little Japanese). She didn\u2019t get in on her looks alone. JYP - only looking for kids and is debuting 4 groups this year, you won\u2019t debut anytime soon. YG - treats even his stars like crap, calls the women ugly, focuses on one group, just screwed over Seungri on purpose, once made G-Dragon shave his head in atonement, generally an ass. No dating policy which broke up Jennie and Kai and just for dating he cancelled everything for her except BlackPink in the US. Made Minzy feel less then, dressed Dara hideously so she couldn\u2019t be too pretty, abandoned Bom and made her get too much plastic surgery and basically broke up 2NE1. Wouldn\u2019t go there unless you enjoy every aspect of your life controlled and being treated like dirt. Even after you\u2019re famous. Everyone else, not sure yet. Small companies, little known except Pledis and no one should ever go there. ",

            "answer_text": "You can try going for Jellyfish ( home to VIXX and Gugudan fyi) Apparently, contracts are signed prior to training so that both company and trainees feel responsibility towards each other, which means that you have some sort of insurance? From what I heard, all expenses are paid by the company, so if the trainee gets cut off ( and wastes all the time spent on training), the company itself will also lose money. The company usually cuts off trainees with attitude problems or lack of willingness and cooperation, but if they cut a trainee off because the he/she doesn\u2019t fit the concept of the group they are about to form, the company will connect the said trainee to another company, so they have a chance on making the cut in another band. So far the artists under Jellyfish are quite talented, and the conditions are rather reasonable. It is not a big company compared to SM, YG and JYP tho, so it\u2019ll be a lil harder to achieve popularity, but that\u2019s only one of the small cons. You can also try out for Bighit ( home to BTS) but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re planning to release a new band anytime soon. ",

You can see my answer on If I want to audition for different companies to become an idol in Korea, can I send the same video and picture material to all of them or do I have to make new for every company? . It\u2019s somewhat related to the Industry you should choose. Different KPOP Companies have their requirements for trainees, and you need to choose the company that suits your style. JYP Entertainment demands a good personality. If you are at least a decent person, you could audition here. You need: Talent - 60% Personality 85% SM Entertainment are known for talent. You need to be VERY good at what you do\u2026 most likely exceptional, before you can get in. Cube Entertainment\u2026. are a weird sect though. Judging from their artists, I suppose you should have a strong fashion sense and a good perception of fashion? Well I could be wrong. The main factor still stands: Research on all the main KPOP Industries, and find what suits you about them. Thanks for the A2A! Here\u2019s a picture of Queen Chungha for moral support. :P  ",

I mean yes you have to go through all that training and hard work but whats the point, you have to train if thats your dream that your passionate about. Either way, I suggest SM. I mean JYP is ok, though personally i don't like JYP because he's very picky and he's doesn't get happy or impressed, should I say with trainees when they put 100% effort into it or you know work hard. Here is one proof why i wouldn't suggest auditioning for JYP   This one actually broke my heart cuz JB, as a leader in GOT7, worked hard to produce those songs and when he took it to JYP, he just listened to a minute of a song, being picky in other words. AND Yg, i mean i guess Yg is good too. But based on what i heard and saw, he can get strict with trainees, you know telling them to work hard and stuff. I mean either way, its your choice which one you feel confident. I suggest SM though any entertainment is fine ",

Training is hard there and they\u2019re strict. They focus on looks more than talent. BUT if you have a lot of talent, maybe you can try? Just note that you might\u2019ve to do plastic surgery. JYP : Sure. Training is less strict THAN YG but have a good personality please. They focus on talent and personality. YG : Maybe? YG focuses a lot on talent and passing the audition is tough. What? Don\u2019t believe me? In thailand, Lisa from BLACKPINK was the only one to pass the YG audition in thailand. Also, YG trainees train for years and most of them don\u2019t debut. But you\u2019ll get instant fame once you debut. Bighit : Again, instant fame. Idk much about the training but its worth a shot. They only accept male trainees though. Cube : Worth a shot. Cube focuses pretty much on dancing (maybe it\u2019s a rumour) so be good at dancing, have talent. (G)I-DLE debuted recently and they had instant fame too. Don\u2019t know if training is tough. Pledis : Don\u2019t really know much but if your really desperate then go ahead. Starship : Training is less tough. Starship treats trainees better. Chance of debuting is also pretty high. So yes. ",

            "answer_text": "I suggest to go for audition in FNC Ent. You can google about the company. They produced FT Island (band), CNBlue (band), AOA (band and dance), many actress and actors (incl. Yoo Jae Suk). They\u2019re open for any kind of talent, and FNC Ent just became the new big 3 management in Korea (replacing JYP). Good things about FNC : They didnt treat the artist so strict. There are only few rules. as long as you didnt make any bad scandal, then it\u2019s okay for you to do whatever you want. (I know this from some interviews with the artists in that company)If you ever watched KPOP Star Hunt, FNC is one of company that wanted to find a trainee from that program.I am a BOICE (CN Blue fans) so I kinda know about their company. Of course they have some (-) points too, but I think every company always have (+) and (-). It depends on you which one that will suit you. ",

            "answer_text": "Just like Quora user George said, it depends on what you\u2019re looking for. JYP is known for talent and personality and I would say also for dancing as well. SM is more on the looks than talent because they believe they can train anyone from scratch but if you\u2019re talented, even better. (I\u2019m not an expert, I could be wrong but this is based on my research in the past about SM.) YG is known for not looking much into looks but more talent than anything. Big Hit is a company that has gained more recognition lately due to BTS but, there\u2019s no research that says what they look for specifically (or maybe there is and I haven\u2019t seen it) but the only thing I can say is that as of right now, they\u2019re only accepting male auditions. Any other K-pop entertainment companies, I know a little about but I rather not disclose because of the fact that I know too little and could be very wrong. Good luck! :) ",

Im a foreigner and for me, it is so hard to find a suitable company to audition for and usually there are requirements to audition. well i would personally recommand:- SM TOWN:- I wud 100% recommand this as it trains the trainees in a way that they are perfect and can debut in a great condition. Sm needs alot of talent and hardword along with good lucks. JYP:- this company usually looks for talent more than looks and focuses on talent too. It is a company worthy auditioning. Just like SM TOWN, its trainees are also trained in a way that they should be perfect. I wud overall recommand SM TOWN if you have alot of talent. but if ur a person like me, who doesnt have such an amazing talent, then go for jyp as it wud probably be easy to get in ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll just give a small tip of advice. Being a K-Pop Star is hard. It\u2019s a competitive field where you can be the face of Korea one day and be the forgotten aging star the next. Trainees do hours and hours of training before doing any actual performances. Those perfect K-Pop videos? The singers and dancers practiced for weeks to just make one video. That being said, I recommend your Korean to be at least good enough to understand commands and have actual conversations. You don\u2019t need to be super fluent, just approachable and understandable. Because you will have to deal with trainers, directors, and the media. And I have no doubt all of them will speak only Korean or very little English/Any Foreign Language. If you want to be a star, singing or rapping is a must, so I suggest you sharpen those skills up. Dancing is great and all, but from every single auditions I\u2019ve seen (and yes, I do have friends who auditioned), those who only know how to dance fail first. Hope this helped. ",

I'm sorry but until you put more work into it your chances aren't small, they are 0. That's like saying you want to be a professional football player but you've never played football. Impossible, right? If you think looking cute and being able to dance is enough, you really need to rethink this. There is a surplus of girls that look cute and can dance. Sorry if this comes off as overly mean, but you need to be realistic. ",

JYP: Cute concepts maybe, good looking, understanding boss, very talented and idk so much about JYP actually. ",

They companys creative vision is much more artistic than others from theories to concepts to style. Plus high quality videos and albums and appealing fan meets and other events. We love blockberry creative. ",

You'll have a higher chance of becoming an idol if you can do more than just dance. You'll also need to be able to speak Korean like a native, for obvious reasons. Keep practicing and never give up!! I believe in you!!! ",

Because the kpop industries are not interested of taking foreign (European, South Asian, African etc) people. And still if you want to take the audition you have to be highly talented in a specific genre. Secondly you need to be good at Korean like their citizen. And overall you have to be true and determined to your goal also u have to be very specific about your goal. ",
