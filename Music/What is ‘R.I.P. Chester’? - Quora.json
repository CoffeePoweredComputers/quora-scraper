            "answer_text": "It is likely in reference to Chester Bennington, the Singer/Songwriter for Linkin Park who committed suicide in mid-July. Honestly? I understand why it is still a thing. Chester was a rather talented songwriter who had a horrible past behind him, which he used as inspiration for his songs. Not only did this appeal to many people as a symbol of strength, but also as a symbol of solidarity. Here was someone who sang about the same sort of problems they had - bullying, parental abuse, substance abuse, isolation - because he had had those same problems. And he was able to use that as a ladder to overcome obstacles. Unfortunately, while his experiences are a large part of what propelled his songwriting and band to the heights it reached, the dwelling on it also meant that it weighed heavily on him - far more than was healthy. I was bullied - to near suicide. And Chester\u2019s songs really did resonate with me. I didn\u2019t know how to cope with the anger, with the pain that I was keeping hidden, and the fact that there were these songs that seemingly harmonized with what was inside me brought me a sense of relief, in a sense. That I wasn\u2019t the only one going through this. So, though I haven\u2019t said it before; Rest in Peace, Chester. You deserve some rest. ",

            "answer_text": "R. I. P. Chester, as per current trending topics, can ONLY refer to the death of Chester Bennington.  Chester Bennington was a singer from Arizona who was part of a band called Dead Before Sunrise. However, his career escalated when he was enlisted by a producer to lead the then formed band Linkin Park, consisting of Mike Shinoda, Bradford Delson, Rob Bourden, Dave Farrell and Joe Hahn. Although his career skyrocketed, his financial situation, which was quite successful, was a polar opposite to his mental condition. He was born from a broken home, where his father left him and he was brought up by his mother. He was constantly bullied throughout his school life and was also forced into an affair with an older man. This fuelled his depression and he turned to drugs for solace. A roaring depression gave a new edge to his voice making it seem natural. Even after a successful career, his depression reached its oeak when his close friend, Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell committed suicide by hanging. This ultimately led to Chester taking his own life in a similar manner on 20th July 2017, when Chris would have been 50 years old. This is the story behind R. I. P. Chester Peace Out! ",
