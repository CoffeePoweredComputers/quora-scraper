            "answer_text": "Elvis did write a few songs early in his career, and collaborated with other writer/friends. Those few songs were tailored for him particularly. He never really had to write any songs as he was so busy touring, and he considered himself as purely a singer, who interpret songs like not other, and not a writer. Back then, there were plenty of writers looking for singers like Elvis, who had a great vocal ranger and stage charisma, to cut the songs. If the song became a hit, the writer would also hit it big. Its now written in History, since Elvis was one of the greatest selling artists of the Century! ",
