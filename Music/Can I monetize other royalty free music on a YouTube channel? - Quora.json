I think that you mean; music tracks on YouTube library and music tracks on other websites\u2026 YouTube gives Royalty Free Music for YouTubers to use for their videos. You can find them on Creator Studio > Create > Audio Library. There are many beautiful music tracks on the other websites. But we cannot use most of them because of the copyright issues. However, there are many other NCS (No Copyright Sounds) on YouTube. You can search as \u2018NCS\u2019 on YouTube and find more beautiful and famous music tracks for your videos. They can be used in your videos and also you can monetize them without any copyright issue\u2026 If you have any questions, please ask\u2026 Thank You\u2026 ",

That said some libraries (including free music Archive, Music Screen..) offers free licenses for private use and for non commercial use. ",
