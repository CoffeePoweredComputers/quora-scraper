            "answer_text": "Vintage Vibe is just look and feel of a vintage looking guitar. Like the telecaster, which Mr.Keith Richard used to have. They are based on famous guitars that famous people played. Classic vibe is the exact replica of a 60s /70s off the shelf strat/tele that was made back then. The neck profile is more accurate, the pickups are much better than a vintage modified or even some entry level MIM strats. I hope this helps! ",
