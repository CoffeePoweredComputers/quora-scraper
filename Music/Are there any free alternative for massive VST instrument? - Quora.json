            "answer_text": "Honestly, no there are not imo. Not to say it\u2019s impossible to use different plugins in place of Massive. But Massive itself works and is designed in such a way that no other free (or paid plugin) can EXACTLY emulate, not to mention it's extremely stable. Plus in my experience, there's typically a noticeable quality difference in most paid plugins vs free plugins. But try to not let lacking a certain tool stop you. By using and/or layering other software synths correctly and or effects on top of that, you can most likely achieve the same or very similar results. But I\u2019d say Massive is absolutely worth investing in whenever you have the means to. ",

            "answer_text": "Like everyone has said, there are no free alternative for massive now. Maybe there will be its free alternative in the future (who knows?) as free synths are getting better every day. For now, I would recommend you these GREAT free synth VSTs: Synth 1:DemoDownloadTAL NoiseMaker:DemoDownloadDEXED:DemoDownloadBoth Synth1 and TAL NoiseMaker are subtractive synths while DEXED is FM synth. You can achieve a very good sound with those synths, especially when you put the right effects on it. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know about alternatives to Massive specifically, but there are definitely many free VST soft-synths out there. A good website to check out for these would be www.bedroomproducersblog.com That being said, a good soft-synth like Sylenth or Massive often becomes a staple of a music production setup. As such, the asking price is very reasonable and well worth purchasing a full copy as it often will pay for itself in usage alone or if you take commissions / produceSubmit for others. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, there are no free alternatives to it. You know, Native Instruments is selling it at 149$, why would others give out similar products for free? The biggest features of massive are his envelopes, LFOs and different types of oscillator that let you produce any kind of musical style. There are some alternatives to it, like Harmor and Serum, but they all cost at least 100$. I'll give you a link to check out some nice free vsts, but unless you have very deep knowledge of synthesis, it would be difficult to understand how the buttons work and in what they affect to the sound. 25 of the best new free VST/AU plugins to download in 2016 ",
