            "answer_text": "For my money, and they're both available free, so whatever, Dedication 2 and Da Drought 3 are among the best mixtapes - ever. They're probably both on my list of best releases of 2007, and Rolling Stone agrees, along with hundreds of other media sites - they're powerful, political, and the calm before the storm before he became one of the biggest stories of the decade. If he released those in 2011, he would have broken Twitter, you know what I mean? They're that good, and DJ Drama is all over Dedication 2.Don't sleep on them - not literally, you'll end up with a crease on your face. Hope this helps.Best,Eric For more music news, follow me on Twitter before Lil Wayne breaks it, again - www.twitter.com/ThatEricAlper ",

For all of Lil Wayne's official mixtape releases (For every official Lil Wayne mixtape there are probably 20 unofficial mixtapes...) stop by www.getrightmusic.com and search away. Enjoy. ",
