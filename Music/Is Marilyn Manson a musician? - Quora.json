She told me that Marilyn Manson was the kindest musician she has ever met. She said he treats everybody with the utmost respect and is a very genuine person. She also said he is extremely smart. She told me that his analytical skill and power of deduction is off the charts. He not only remembers things well but is exceptional at problem solving. Who would of thought Marilyn Manson is some sweetheart genius?  ",
