            "answer_text": "I have a cheap bass. I\u2019ve had it for 13 years. A friend of mine has the same brand and model I do. He had it for about 10 years. Mine always sound really well. My friend\u2019s sounded like crap. How could it be? I posted this before, but I will tell the story again. The first difference between our basses was maintenance. I played my regularely and always took care of having it in good shape. My friend didn\u2019t play it that much and had it stored. I decided to get his bass and giving it a full maintenance. I straighten up the neck (it was bowed, so the truss rod made the trick), I shielded the electronics and I set up the action. I also changed the strings. Suddenly, my friend\u2019s bass was awesome! So, before buying a new bass or tossing yours out, the first thing you must do is to check if your neck is straight. My suggestion is to take it to a technician which can check neck, bridge, action, and all the mechanics. The worst thing that could happen is to have a bent neck that can\u2019t be straighten up. That the only scenario where I would consider buying a new bass. Having the mechanics set, your bass will feel like a completely different instrument. Next thing would be to set up your pickups to get the right sound you want. A technicial can help you with that as well. Or you can do it yourself with a screwdriver and some knowledge. One of the most annoying thing about a cheap instrument is that noise generated when you are not touching the strings or metal parts. And the procedure to get rid of that is cheap and easy, and it\u2019s called shielding. The procedure can vary depending on your bass model, but the principle is the same: Building a Farady cage around your circuits, eliminating any external noise. I did that to my bass, and I have no regrets. To that point, your bass must be a very decent bass, and a nice one to play. Do you want to take it to the next level? Alright! Let\u2019s get there. Here\u2019s my bass, brand new:  As I said, it was a very decent bass. But I decided to take it to the next level: As I mentioned, I shielded the electronicsOne of my tuning machines got busted, so I replaced them with Fender American Jazz Bass original onesI replaced the bridge with a Hipshot KickAss 4 high mass bridge. It\u2019s a much better bridge than my original Squier one, and I\u2019m really happy with it.I replaced the pickups with DiMarzio Ultra Jazz DP149. Yes, they are awesome!And since one of my pots was busted I decided to change all the electronics, including an Orange Drop capacitor.I need to highlight, none of those modifications were magic wands. The didn\u2019t make me a better bassist. And definitely, sound comes from the player, not the instrument. But I have to admit I love the little edge those modifications gave me. Of course, I had to give the bass a personal touch, and decided to paint it (for the record, I messed up the paint 2 times before I got it right, hehe! Lack of experience has a cost). Here\u2019s my bass today:  And yes, it sounds as well as any high-end bass in the market. Cost? Including the bass, around $400. If you want more information, I\u2019d be happy to provide it. Don\u2019t disregard an instrument just because it is \u201ccheap\u201d. Cheap instruments can be the best platform to build the ultimate kickass instrument. ",

            "answer_text": "In addition to the good answers here about adjusting the neck, setting the action (height of strings), shielding the electronics and possibly upgrading the pickups and controls, don\u2019t forget to consider your amp. A small, underpowered amp and speakers can do terrible things to the tone of a bass. I have a variety of inexpensive and basses and they sound much better with the right amp and speakers. Playing the same bass through a 20-watt 8\u2033 combo sucks life out of the sound compared to playing it through a decent rig. I have a few amps and the decent sounding ones are generally 100 watts or better, even for playing quietly around the house. For speakers, I have a 2x10 cabinet that sounds pretty good. I have also used the 15\u2033 speaker in a combo amp running through a separate head for a pretty nice sound. For performing, you will likely need even more capable equipment, depending on the venue.
