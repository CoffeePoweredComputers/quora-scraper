            "answer_text": "Thanks for your request! I\u2019m hesitant to consider Blue Oyster Cult as a full on metal band, and I lean more towards categorizing them in the hard rock department. However, I do think they left their mark and helped to shape the metal world that followed them, perhaps more so thematically than in their sound. One glance at the cover art and track listing of their fantastic record Fire of Unknown Origin, and you can see how one who hadn\u2019t heard it might jump to the conclusion that it was indeed a metal record. Song titles like \u201cVeteran of the Psychic Wars,\u201d \u201cVengeance (The Pact),\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Turn Your Back,\u201d \u201cAfter Dark,\u201d and the title track would all be right at home on any metal record, and from any of metal\u2019s sub-genres. And even if not, they have a song titled \u201cHeavy Metal: The Black and Silver.\u201d Pretty right on the nose. Blue Oyster Cult toured with Black Sabbath on the cleverly (if not a bit predictably) titled, \u201cBlack and Blue Tour\u201d during the early 80\u2019s. Sabbath are undoubtedly a metal act, so the inclusion of BOC on this tour could lend some credibility to their status as a metal band, but again, I think they fall under the hard rock banner more so than metal. Either way you look at it, their influence is still felt to this day. One of metal\u2019s biggest acts of the past decade, Sweden\u2019s Satanic ritual rousing group, Ghost, are often compared to Blue Oyster Cult in terms of their sound. With their anonymous \u201cNameless Ghouls,\u201d and front man and leader Tobias Forge portraying either his anti-pope character Papa Emeritus or the classically dapper Cardinal Ciopa, Ghost appear to be pure heavy metal. That is, until you actually hear the band, and their brand of masterfully melodic, hook heavy 70\u2019s sounding hard rock that they utilize so often. While they can certainly chug out some Metallica inspired riffs, particularly on their brilliant debut album Opus Eponymous, they share way more in common in sound with BOC than they do with the Bay Area thrash legends. Personally, I consider Ghost to be a metal band thanks in large part to their unwavering worship of all things wicked, but they are definitely a divisive group among many metal fans, and I often find that fans of the genre either love them or hate them. That they are so frequently compared to BOC is an interesting fact in context to the question of whether or not BOC themselves, are in fact, a metal band or not. And while it is a fine line at times between hard rock and pure metal, I think maybe BOC are just a few too many cow bell knells deep to truly be considered metal, even if they did help to impact the genre.

            "answer_text": "No. They are a hard rock band. The distinction between hard rock and heavy metal can be blurry at times. Metal is typically described as having a heavier and louder sound than hard rock and explores various themes that rock shies away from including fantasy, current and historical events, the occult and horror. Hard rock typically focuses on themes closer to the sex, drugs and rock and roll stereotype. But bands from one genre can often make music that at least has some characteristics of the other. ",
