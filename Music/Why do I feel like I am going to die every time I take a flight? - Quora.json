            "answer_text": "What's interesting here is that your fear, though true within you, is not really reality. If it were you would not be on Quora right now. Thinking about sitting in a long tube flying at 500 mph and you don't have any control can be fearful. With that said you also have very experienced pilots who are trained to fly that missle so really no worries. ",
