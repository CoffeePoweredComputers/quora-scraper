            "answer_text": "You can get a speakers alone for a several lakhs of rupees. (even there are speakers for crores). If this is your first real surround or speaker system, 35k is a fantastic budget to start off. Because, I too started off at the same budget and loved the system and have upgraded to a much better system in the later years. My first system was an Onkyo HT-3400 package. It's the most basic package from Onkyo. But, performs way above the usual consumer brands like Philips, Sony, Samsung or LG. I'd call a HT-3400 a real basic home theater setup. I enjoyed the setup for 2 years and I was amazed by value it offered for money. Now, HT-3400 is no more\u2026HT-3800 replaced the 3400. For a starter system, it should absolutely satisfy all the basic needs for a new listener or a home theatre owner. There are other similar brands which offers good audio/video receivers like Yamaha, Pioneer, Marantz, Denon and so on.. (Even Sony has it\u2026but, that's a different line it's not marketed like a common home theatre package) But why Onkyo-HT3800 to start off?? Onkyo not only provides a good receiver. But also, a descent speaker system + subwoofer for money. Yamaha has a similarly priced package YHT-296. But, the speakers in the box are fairly bit inferior when compared to the 3800. other brands like Marantz and Denon wont make speakers. I strongly suggest you to take a demo of Onkyo HT3800. If you are in a metro, you should easily be able to.. Feel free to shoot if you have more queries\u2026Happy to help.. ",
