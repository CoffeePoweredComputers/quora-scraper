            "answer_text": "There are a couple of ways that don\u2019t rely on expensive plug-ins. If the source material is a solo vocal or any other mono source you can often completely eliminate the reverb (assuming the reverb is stereo). You simply have to feed your track through a Mid/Side matrix and remove the Side elements. Voila! No reverb. It really depends on the effects, if the differences between L&R are minimal then it will be difficult to completely remove the FX. But in several cases I\u2019ve been able to completely lose all traces of the effect. If you don\u2019t have access to any M/S processing you can try phase extraction, which is essentially the same thing, just a little more broken down. This entails splitting the source to mono L & R channels and reversing the polarity on one side. This will eliminate all mono content in the centre. Replaying this against a polarity reversed version of the track will result in just your dry vocal. ",

            "answer_text": "If you recorded it like that, you\u2019re stuck with it. The best you can do is put a transient designer plugin on it like SPL transient designer and it can reduce it slightly but not enough to probably warrant not re-recording it properly. Other people have talked about mid-side effects/separation but that only applies if you\u2019re doing a remix of an A Cappella or something as vocals are usually mono tracks and mid-side processing only helps stereo tracks.
