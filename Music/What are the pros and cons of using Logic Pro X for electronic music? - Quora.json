            "answer_text": "Logic is a great daw. I\u2019ve been using it for years. Cons: only for Mac, you have to buy it, if you collaborate a lot, most of your friends will be using ableton which they probably pirate copied for free from someone. Pros. I feel like it\u2019s the most versatile DAW and that the built in plug ins are really good. The updates are always improving the DAW and the new version of logic is exceptional with its improved time stretching. Logic now does pretty much everything as well as all the other daws. Most important of all, for me, is that I like mixing down in logic the best. I have many friends that use ableton to create but then export everything into logic to get their mix proper. I feel like even after 10 years in logic I\u2019m still learning new things all the time. The program does so much more than you think. People who hate on logic or used to use it before switching to ableton never mastered the program before switching. Ultimately, it really doesn\u2019t matter which daw you use, it\u2019s all about preference. All the big DAW programs like ableton and pro tools and logic are really good. You can make a hit record on any of them, jus touch one and become a complete master of the program. ",

            "answer_text": "I was a logic user back before Apple bought it, when it was made by emagic. I switched to Ableton when they were on version 5, so a long time ago. A couple if years ago I decided to switch back to logic just to change it up a bit. A few things I noticed a completely dry kick in Logic sounded way better than the same exact dry sample in AbletonMidi remains its strong suit \u2014 locking into a key sig, transformation within that etc.The learning curve suckedLearning key commands in logic was messing up my ableton muscle memoryAfter a short time I realized that logic would require a while for me to get and I would mess up my ableton fluidity. So I quit quickly. Also ableton is way better for live performance, you can DJ with it, and it supports vsts along with AU etc (I believe logic doesn't support vsts). ",
