I\u2019m pretty sure they still keep in contact and are still really good friends, but I\u2019m not sure if BamBam does like Lisa, though their friendship is pretty sweet. Honestly, I think BamBam and Lisa might be cute together, but there was no time, at least I dont think so, when BamBam mention Lisa more than a friend. Hope this helps! ",
