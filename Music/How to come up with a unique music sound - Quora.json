            "answer_text": "In my experience it\u2019s simple: don\u2019t try. Just make music. Let the music be what it wants to be, informed by your tastes and experiences. If you\u2019re driven to experiment then do so. But only in so far as it is for the purpose of exploration, because it\u2019s what you really want to do. Not because you feel you can\u2019t sound even a little like anyone else. This doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t pick a genre (hip-hop/funk rock/jazz/whatever.) It means that within your chosen genre don\u2019t go out of your way concerning yourself with trying to ensure you sound nothing like anyone else. Inevitably, except in rare circumstances, there will be elements of your sound that are like something else. This is no bad thing. What matters is \u201cdoes it sound like you copied someone or like you incorporated what someone else did into your own sound?\u201d If you can say the latter then you\u2019ve achieved your goal. Even people who invented new genres started from a base of music they liked which was developed into something that sounded new but if you listen you\u2019ll hear all their major influences (identifying minor influences is trickier but they\u2019re there also.) Searching for a way to sound nothing like anything anyone has ever heard before is not as one person said undesirable, but it is for the most part unattainable (except perhaps by accident.) And entirely unnecessary. I\u2019ll get up on my soapbox here. In the world of electronic music there is a subset of composers (no listeners, I expect) who look down on the use of synth presets. They feel that to have your own sound you must design your instrument sounds from scratch. The equivalent of telling a guitarist they can\u2019t go out and buy a guitar, they must build their own. Not only that, they must build one that sounds like no guitar ever before. This is of course completely ridiculous. A distinct sound that is all your own doesn\u2019t rest on the sources. It rests on how you use those sources. The same is true of your musical influences. ",

            "answer_text": "That's easy \u2014 anything might be claimed to be \"music.\" (Cf. John Cage - Wikipedia) The real question is whether one's \"unique music sound\" registers favorably enough twith enough listeners for them to successfully convey their enthusiasm to an expanding number of other listeners. Pretty much always, listeners prefer to listen to music closely aligned with whatever they have come to hear as music. Anybody wanting to make a living at \"coming up with a unique music sound\" had best conform his music to his own contemporary listeners. Or else be an uncommon musical genius. ",
