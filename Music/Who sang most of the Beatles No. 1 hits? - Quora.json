            "answer_text": "My guess would be John. No doubt Paul had some big hits as well. I did a list one time of all my favorite Beatle songs. I looked them up one by one to see who wrote what. John songs slightly outweighed Pauls. Typically who ever wrote the song was the lead singer on the song. What was cool too is how they did a dual lead vocal on some songs, great blend and talent the two of them. It\u2019s interesting because they both have dynamics different from each other. John to me is a little more straight forward meat and potatoes harder hitting rock and roll. Not saying he didn\u2019t have some moments with slower and softer songs. To put it bluntly John had more balls to his songs overall. I find his songs more simple too. \u201cCome Together\u201d, \u201cI want you (She\u2019s so heavy)\u201d and \u201cRevolution\u201d come to mind. That being said Paul is a musician\u2019s musician and the better singer of the two. Paul has a bigger range and is a more refined vocalist. It\u2019s well documented that both John and Paul played multiple instruments, but to me it\u2019s clear Paul could of been and on some of the songs was a one man band. Check out \u201cBack in the U.S.S.R.\u201d, I believe that\u2019s Paul on the drums. Paul is insanely talented as an artist as well. Although he might of had less hits, Pauls hits were monsters. I think they may of stayed on the charts longer. Songs like \u201cYesterday\u201d, \u201cHey Jude\u201d and \u201cLet it Be\u201d. Those were anthems, universal songs that stood out maybe more than the others. I would also say Paul has some rockers too \u201cHelter Skelter\u201d he put it down. I also think Pauls writing style is a bit more complex than Johns. It\u2019s clear he\u2019s a smart and deep individual. ",
