            "answer_text": "In America it is probably The Battle Hymn of the Republic: Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword;His truth is marching on. Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!His truth is marching on.I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps,His day is marching on.I have read His fiery gospel writ in rows of burnished steel!\"As ye deal with my condemners, so with you My grace shall deal!Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel, \"Since God is marching on.He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him; be jubilant, my feet!Our God is marching on. In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me;As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free!While God is marching on. Just to mention, The Battle Hymn of the Republic as it is so-called has no official sanctioning by the United States government as such. It is an unofficial patriotic song popular with Christian Nationalists. ",

            "answer_text": "What is the most widely popular hymn? +JMJ+ For anyone who has ever been in religious life, or studying for the priesthood, it, no doubt, is the Salve Regina, as that is the one hymn that everyone learns to sing A Cappella every evening of their life at the end of the day. At nearly every Catholic funeral I have ever been at, the family always requests Ave Maria for the Communion meditation.
