            "answer_text": "The question is \u201ctop 10 favorite bands\u201d This answer was moved by Quora from a question asking what is your favorite band. It has been appealed but not reinstated yet\u2026 My favorite band is one that never received the respect and success that they deserved, even though they influenced many bands that are now in the RRHOF and/or are considered legends of Rock music. They started out in the Bay Area, in California, and grew a huge local following who loved their Hard Rock sound. Three of the four original members have passed away, way too young, in the last few years. The band carries on however, lead by it\u2019s lead singer/lead guitarist. The trio with him are absolutely amazing, and even after 40 years of singing, his voice still sounds strong. They are some of the hardest working guys in music, touring over 8 months of year around the world, making sure that hard rock keeps its place in the world. I give to you, Y&T: Original Lineup (in order L to R) - Joey Alves - Rhythm Guitar/Backing Vocals, Phil Kennemore - Bass Guitar/Backing Vocals, Dave Meniketti - Lead Vocals/Lead Guitar, Leonard Haze - Drums/Percussion  Current Lineup (in order L to R) - Mike Vanderhule - Drums/Percussion, John Nymann - Rhythm Guitar/Backing Vocals, Dave Meniketti - Lead Vocals/Lead Guitar, Aaron Leigh - Bass Guitar/Backing Vocals  I go every year at least once to see these guys in concert. They are absolutely amazing live and over all the years I\u2019ve been a fan I\u2019ve also gotten to know Dave and his wife Jill, who is also the band\u2019s manager. They have a DVD in process that will document the life of the band and also pay tribute to the three fallen original members. The thing I can\u2019t wait to see most are all of the interviews with other musicians and singers talking about how much of an influence these guys were on them. To me, that will at least honor them from that standpoint since they never got much from industry itself. Give a listen to some of their tracks on YouTube; Rescue Me, I Believe in You, Forever and Mean Streak and you\u2019ll see what I mean. If you like Hard Rock, you won\u2019t be disappointed. ",

            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, I don\u2019t feel I can put these in any sort of order as what I listen to depends entirely on how I feel at the time, so here\u2019s my list in no particular order: Oasis  Favourite song: Don\u2019t Look Back in Anger I\u2019m really not the best person to ask about technique as my musical terminology is somewhat limited, I just think they have a bloody great sound with blatantly obvious influence from the Beatles and multiple other rock bands including U2, Sex Pistols and The Doors (according to the band themselves). They are, in my opinion, one of the best \u201cmodern\u201d rock bands on the planet (because I refuse to accept that they have broken up). Pink Floyd  Favourite song: Arnold Layne (w/ Syd Barrett) or Hey You (w/ Dave Gilmour) I\u2019ll never deny how much I love psychedelic rock, and the almost philosophical nature to their lyrics. I have never listened to a Pink Floyd song that I didn\u2019t like, whether it was psychedelic, progressive, or art rock; each respective genre is a masterpiece when it applies to their music. I believe that each member of Pink Floyd, including Syd Barrett, were and are incredible talents and I\u2019m so saddened by the loss of two men who were so influential in the creation of their iconic sound. Led Zeppelin  Favourite song: I know it\u2019s cliche, but Stairway to Heaven is a masterpiece. Although Immigrant Song and Kashmir are also absolutely amazing. I give up, I can\u2019t choose. Led Zeppelin\u2019s music is undeniably brilliant, dabbling in multiple genres from folk rock to heavy metal. Robert Plant\u2019s beautiful bluesy howl and slightly whiny but gravelly sound, combined with the power of the music, makes all of their songs an absolute pleasure to listen to. Muse  Favourite song: Plug in Baby/Map of the Problematique (this was a bloody hard decision to make and I still couldn\u2019t narrow it down to one) Muse are, without a doubt, one of the best rock bands in the world today. The bass lines are some of the best I have ever heard in my life and Matt Bellamy has crazy vocal range. If you\u2019ve never listened to their music before, seriously, check them out. The Doors  Favourite song: The Crystal Ship/The End Labelled as both a Psychedelic Rock and Acid Rock band, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you thought only junkies listened to this kind of music. The Doors music is a drug in and of itself; I always find myself coming back for more and feeling so far out of space and time when I listen to such songs as the ones listed above. Morrison\u2019s vocals vary from deep and classical (Riders on The Storm) to a kind of shrieking growl (Break on Through). If you like Psychedelic or Classic Rock I\u2019d definitely say this band is for you. Nirvana  Favourite song: Heart-Shaped Box/In Bloom The staple of grunge music in the early nineties, Nirvana are a legendary band. It saddens me that many only know them for their hit \u2018Smells Like Team Spirit\u2019 when they released so many songs that are just as awesome. Cobain has a wonderfully whiny, growling voice that not only emphasises his disdain for modern pop culture, but also the anger he felt towards societal expectations and ideals. To me, Nirvana represent that rebellious streak within us all and the desire to shout \u201cfuck you!\u201d at those who judge us for individuality. The Beatles  Favourite song: Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds What could I possibly say that hasn\u2019t been said before? The Beatles are one of the most famous bands in the world and they\u2019re so damn brilliant that audience members pissed themselves in excitement at their concerts. Their music changed the sound of the Sixties and the vocals of both Lennon and McCartney will go down in history as the voices of a decade. Green Day  Favourite song: Jesus of Suburbia This is where it\u2019s starting to get hard, because Green Day aren\u2019t a band I immediately think of when someone asks me what my favourite bands are. This is not to say that Green Day aren\u2019t excellent but they\u2019re not a band I listen to daily or even regularly. Despite this, I would have to say that the songs I know by Green Day are all songs I love. Green Day are the kind of band I go to when I\u2019m feeling like I don\u2019t give a fuck, and I just want to thrash around to the punk sound they carried over into the noughties. Armstrong has a very distinct American accent when he sings, which is something I\u2019m not used to (as most of the bands listed above are English) but it wouldn\u2019t be the same without it. ~ Neither of the following are bands but I just couldn\u2019t not mention them ~ Bob Dylan  Favourite song: Subterranean Homesick Blues/Times They Are A-Changin\u2019/Mr Tambourine Man Bob Dylan, often called \u2018The Voice of a Generation\u2019, is a poet in my eyes. Although I love folk music, it\u2019s not the music itself that really captures my attention, but the lyrics. His lyrics are some of the most profound of any musician and I truly believe that everyone should read the lyrics to his songs before they hear them to truly appreciate what this man has given to the world. Come gather 'round peopleWherever you roamAnd admit that the watersAround you have grownAnd accept it that soonYou'll be drenched to the bone.If your time to youIs worth savin'Then you better start swimmin'Or you'll sink like a stoneFor the times they are a-changin'. Syd Barrett  Favourite song: Octopus, Terrapin, Dark Globe and Golden Hair (I refuse to pick just one) Syd Barrett, the \u2018crazy diamond\u2019 of early Pink Floyd, went on to release more music even after his departure from the band he founded years earlier. His albums The Madcap Laughs and Barrett were released in 1970 after he\u2019d already undergone some form of mental deterioration, which is often attributed to an acid overdose (though some argue schizophrenia). I believe that his excessive drug use, whether he was an acid casualty or not, definitely influenced his sound which was heavily psychedelic and rather unusual, but wondrous nonetheless. Many artists, including the late David Bowie, have cited him as being a great influence on them in terms of songwriting and/or vocal style, and rightly so. ",
