            "answer_text": "Nuno Bettencourt from Extreme. When other musicians heard his solo from 'Do You Wanna Play?', they accused him of using trick edits to pull it off on the single. (edit: not the most difficult, but definitely one of the most awesome and expressive blues solos ever played was by Prince at the 2003 Hall Of Fame awards. He was performing 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' with a bunch of other rock and pop legends, and stepped up at the three minute mark to totally blow everyone away. Check it out on YouTube, it's phenomenal. ",

            "answer_text": "You ned to be careful when evaluating guitar solos. In the old days, one would have to write a construct a solo and then play it. Ordinarily, well written solos had a beginning, a middle and an end, and were sometimes a piece of music, within the music. With todays\u2019 digital technology, it is not uncommon for guitarists to take as many as 10[-15 takes on a solo and then pick and choose the best moments from each take, and compile them into one solo. David lee Roth once claimed that Eddie Van Halen did this in the studio. The solo may or may not sound good when done this way, but it\u2019s not a very honest approach and likely near impossible to pull off live. ",
