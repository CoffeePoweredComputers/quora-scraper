            "answer_text": "They likely would have made better business decisions. I think the Beatles disbanded because of drug abuse, good argument could be made for this. Many,many bands ,organisation s have failed or become unworkable due to drug and alcohol dependency.Creativity comes from the mind not from drugs or alcohol, I think the substance abuse probably detracted from their careers.
