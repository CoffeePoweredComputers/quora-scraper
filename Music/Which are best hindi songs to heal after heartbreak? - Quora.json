            "answer_text": "Listen to the new trending Befikra by Meet Bros. It\u2019s a cool one. Lyrics meant a lot..!! Listen to some Hindi party songs. Silent, sufi and sweet songs might not help you that much, as lyrics of these songs commonly narrates love, memories, affection etc. So prefer some dance numbers. Here is the sample list for you : Sau tarah ke (Dishoom)Apna har din (Golmaal 3)Abhi toh party shuru hui hai (Khoobsurat)Buddhu sa mann (Kapoor and Sons)Zindagi aa raha hu main ( Album by Atif Aslam)In case this is not your taste, prefer some instrumentals. There are few good silent songs too. Agar tum saath ho (Tamasha)Khwaishein (Calender Girls)Kal ho na ho Title TrackEktaara (Wake Up Sid)Listen some local compositions, funny songs if you like. Try to enjoy music, instruments. Avoid relating with lyrics. And the bravery award goes to YOU..!!! ",
