            "answer_text": "Describing a phonograph record, LP stood for \"long playing\" and the play was made long by using 33 rpm instead of 78.  Most LPs quickly standardized on a 12-inch diameter, too, larger than most 78s.   I believe that (at least originally) an EP record was 7 inches in diameter-- like a 45 rpm record-- and might be either 45 rpm or 33 rpm.  EP stood for \"extended play\" and if the speed was 45 rpm, the play was extended by squeezing the grooves closer together at some risk to quality.  Two, maximum three songs fit on a side.  They were good for promotions; a company could give them away or sell them for a nominal fee.  But many were full-fledged commercial products, such as the British version of Magical Mystery Tour. Today a CD may be marketed as an \"EP\" if it contains an amount of music more or less equivalent to what an EP record would contain. ",

            "answer_text": "LP stands for long playing and EP is extended play. The differences is usually the number of songs or available space for songs. An LP can have roughly 20 minutes a side, an EP is about half that though they are both 12\" in diameter.Usually EPs are first releases for an artist or special releases-for example maybe they didn't have enough music for a full album.LPs are similar to today's CDs but due to having less space, a typical LP might contain 10 songs where a CD often has 2 to 4 (or at least it can fit more if the artist chooses).
