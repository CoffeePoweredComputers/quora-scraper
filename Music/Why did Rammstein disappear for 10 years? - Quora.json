            "answer_text": "Richard Kruspe was making problems for them. He was telling people what they should do and how they should sound like, and they had enough of him. So they broke up for 10 years but decided they did not wanna break up completely. Richard had to attend therapy to be admitted back, and now every week, they go to a one.hour therapy together as a band to talk about their feelings. The members also supported Richard in creating a side band because he had somebody else to yell at, and that mellowed his pent-up energy. He is a control freak, he said that, but he changed for the better, and now the band has better relationships together than ever. ",

            "answer_text": "They didn't. They chose to focus primarily on their side projects from a recording standpoint, but they still played some shows. From what they've said in interviews, they felt the band was running short of creative options and they were more free to explore new musical territory outside of the general realm where Rammstein had established itself. After enough time had passed, they came together and found there was still room to explore without going completely outside that realm. However, it sounds like the self-titled album may be the last from them as a band. We'll see. ",
