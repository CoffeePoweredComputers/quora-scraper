            "answer_text": "Hmmm my favourites off the top of my head must be: Grandmaster Flash - White Lines Grandmaster Flash is an absolute MUST for old school hip-hop - The Message, White Lines. Guy was pretty popular in the 90s.  Beastie Boys - Intergalactic  Salt N' Peppa' - Push It Perhaps more of a late 80's - early 90's vibe to this song but technically by a hip hop group :D  If you're looking for more 'hip-hoppy' songs by Salt N' Peppa' though, I suggest Blacks Magic. Got the record myself at home and I love playing it when I need my old-school hip-hop pickup.  Whodini -Freaks Come Out at Night My dad happened to be a fan of Whodini so I got a lot of his old records and discovered these bad boys. Their song Friends might be their most famous, most sampled song.     ",
