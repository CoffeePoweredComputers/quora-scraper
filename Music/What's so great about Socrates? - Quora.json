            "answer_text": "The Socratic Method is an essential way to analyze the validity of any person\u2019s contention. Socrates laid out some important philosophical foundations. Here are some for practical usage. \u201cThe only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.\u201d This is arguably the most significant concept in all of philosophy. \u201cBeware the barrenness of a busy life.\u201d This tells you not to become wrapped up in a myriad of conceptual perceptions and banal acts but rather \u201cbe here now\u201d.  \u201cBy all means, marry. If you get a good wife, you'll become happy; if you get a bad one, you'll become a philosopher.\u201d That speaks for itself as a bit of humor. \u201cOnce made equal to man, woman becomes his superior.\u201d This is Socrates\u2019 recognition that females are the core of a sexual species and that males are peripheral females whose main purpose is to present half a seed.  \u201cThe way to gain a good reputation is to endeavor to be what you desire to appear.\u201d \u201cBe as you wish to seem.\u201d Wish and desire are conceptual attributes and these quotes tell you that behavior counts, talk is cheap. \u201cHe is richest who is content with the least, for content is the wealth of nature.\u201d Socrates recognizes that we were born with a survival instinct because we really want to be here and when we clutter this up with too many accoutrements, we lose the enjoyment of being here. We are better off not spending our time in the engagement of trivial pursuits. \u201cI was really too honest a man to be a politician and live.\u201d Unfortunately this speaks for itself. \u201cHe is a man of courage who does not run away, but remains at his post and fights against the enemy.\u201d Belief causes courage and this says that if you really believe in something then stick to your guns. \u201cBe slow to fall into friendship; but when thou art in, continue firm and constant.\u201d This speaks for itself.  \u201cBeauty is a short-lived tyranny.\u201d This speaks for itself. \u201cAn honest man is always a child.\u201d This says that honesty should only be given to those you respect because it can be so easily misused. \u201cA system of morality which is based on relative emotional values is a mere illusion, a thoroughly vulgar conception which has nothing sound in it and nothing true.\u201d Socrates knew that the concept of morality is made as a social lubricant and it cannot be created by arbitrary values.  \u201cThe poets are only the interpreters of the gods.\u201d This is where Socrates explains that metaphysical analysis is ethereal. The Socratic Method, his assessment of knowledge, and the timing of his entrance makes Socrates the greatest contributor that philosophy has ever had. ",
