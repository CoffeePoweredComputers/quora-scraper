            "answer_text": "James Hetfield - Lead Guitar, purely because of his solo in \u201cTo Live Is To Die\u201d by Metallica. Zakk Wylde - Vocals, rhythm guitar purely because of his voice on Black Label Society Live +5. Brann Dailor - Drums, because of \u201cCall Of The Mastodon\u201d and a few other albums. Cliff Burton - Bass Guitar. No need for explanation. They are a Metal band that play with melody, because of Hetfield\u2019s playing, they have heavy low - tuned riffs, and brutal vocals because of Zakk Wylde (Alcohol Fuelled Brewtality voice), who also can sing any style. They have a phenomenal drummer, that does what\u2019s needed, and one of the best bassists ever. ",

            "answer_text": "If I bring people back from the dead Terry Kath - Guitar, vocals Jack Holden- Bass ( a phenomenal player nobody has ever heard of. Jaco Pastorius school player) Joe Morello - Drums Reese Wynans - Keyboards. I\u2019d add a horn section on occasion. Lee Thornburg -Trumpet, Richard \u201cSlide\u201d Hyde-Trombone, Steve Douglas- Saxophone I\u2019d like to hear how Terry Kath would interact with a 2nd guitar player. So maybe I\u2019d add the best 2nd guitarist to ever play in a band, Dickie Betts- Guitar. Dickie could definitely handle the jazz influences everyone else brings. They\u2019d play Soulful Rock and Blues with a Jazz style. ",
