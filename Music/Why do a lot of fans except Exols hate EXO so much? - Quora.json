            "answer_text": "First of all,it's not like except Exols other fandoms hate Exo.I have seen alot of fandoms praising Exo.For example:Ikonics,VIP,Carats,Innercircles,Nctzens,Blinks,Once etc. Second thing even if they don't like Exo but they don't hate much.I know alot of multis and alot of other fandom's people who praise Exo and even if they don't praise,they don't say bad about them much.It's maybe like you have seen just the hate parts of these things that's why you think other fandoms hate Exo but it's not like that. Third thing,Other people hate Exo bcuz of jealousy.Yessss,Exo is not active much,they don't promote much,other award shows rob them,SM sabotages them,Exo is a 8 years old group that is a senior group,they haven't done a world tour properly,3 of their members left the group,one is in China,2 are in military,Exo has went through alot of scandals(that was not their fault)BUT STILL EXO IS ONE OF THE TOP GROUPS IN KPOP AND REIGNING LIKE KINGS!!!!!!!and bcuz of this alot of people get jealous.They still sale albums alot.They are still in the competition.Without any help of their company,they are doing this.Not much groups do this and remain like a king in kpop still after so many things happened to them.This is why some people hate them. But still I'm saying alot of other fandoms love Exo and respect them. ",
