            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A Why do so many non-country music fans think country music is racist? As someone who, for a long time was NOT a country-music fan\u2026 And while I can enjoy some, I still wouldn\u2019t technically call myself a \u2018fan\u2019. I can enjoy it, and some artists\u2026. I don\u2019t think that they do think it\u2019s racist. I never did,. Now, when you think of most country music\u2026 what do you think of? Distinctly almost all white and \u2018southern\u2019 people. A few exceptions like Darius Rucker and Cowboy Troy stand out as being black. Now, the SJW\u2019s would likely call country music racist, because of the distinct lack of non-whites actually performing it. But outside of some potentially actually racist artists (And no, I can\u2019t think of any at the moment), you rarely, if ever hear of any truly racist lyrics these days in country music. If anything, country music is (or at least sounds) more wholesome than a lot of other pop music. And a lot less racist than a lot of rap. Now, that\u2019s not to say that country music can\u2019t be as sexualized, or even moreso at times\u2026 (trust me, there\u2019s a LOT of sex sung about in country music), but it\u2019s not as blatantly in your face\u2026 It\u2019s alluded to with often comical analogies\u2026 \u2018check you for ticks\u2019\u2026 for example.

            "answer_text": "I think those that call country music racist are referring to the perception that country appeals primary to white southerners, midwesteners and westerners in medium and small cities and towns where they think more racial prejudice exists. I have been a country music DJ and programmer since 1979 and have found NO prejudice in any of the songs played or released by the record companies. I have MC'd many country shows and spent time backstage with many country entertainers and have never heard any racially prejudiced remark. Many of the original country stars such as Hank Williams Sr , Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash have made it clear that they learned music from black men they befriended in the southern US. While it is true that not many black performers have had country hits, it should be noted that when a black singer comes along with music that fits the \"country style\" that person can be very successful. Charley Pride and Darius Rucker are two excellent examples. The key to an African American having success in country is the music. Country radio is not going to play a song by a black artist that doesn't blend with the other music played by country stations. It is also true that no urban formatted stations are going to play music with fiddles and steel guitars. I believe there are more black singers out there that will have country hits in the future but they will be singing country music in a country style. ",
