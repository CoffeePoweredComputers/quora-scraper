            "answer_text": "If I may, I\u2019d like to comment on one particular lyric in the song: \u201cJesus freaks out in the street, handing tickets out for God.\u201d I first heard this song around 1990, when I started listening to Classic Rock radio. A year earlier, I had done a term paper in college about the Jesus Movement of the late-60s/70s (the \u201cJesus freaks\u201d or Jesus People). They were hippies who became born-again Christians but continued dressing and speaking like members of the counterculture. In my research I learned that there was a particular group of Jesus People called the Alamo Christian Foundation, which developed eventually into a cult. Anyway, they were formed in 1969 in Hollywood, CA, and in the early days they would walk the streets of Hollywood recruiting people into their group, offering them a meal if they would come to their headquarters for a prayer meeting. So when I first heard the song \u201cTiny Dancer\u201d and its reference to \u201cJesus freaks\u201d in Hollywood, I thought, \u201cIs he singing about the Alamo Christian Foundation?\u201d I\u2019ve never heard anyone confirm it, but the facts seem to fit that conclusion. Bernie Taupin wrote the song after his first visit to the US in 1970. The Alamo Christian Foundation had been founded only a year before and was still working the streets of Hollywood at that time. So he may very well have seen them and included them in the song! Just wanted to add that to a discussion of the lyrics because it\u2019s rarely mentioned. I read another site online where someone suggested that the \u201cJesus freaks\u201d in the song were probably Hare Krishnas, but that\u2019s highly unlikely. Hare Krishnas were/are a very different movement which worships Krishna, not Jesus. There was a definite religious movement among hippies at the time, the adherents of which were commonly called \u201cJesus freaks,\u201d so it only makes sense that Taupin was referring to them. ",

            "answer_text": "Well knowing the song lyrics pretty well\u2026I would say that it has to do with women or a woman of the night (hooker/prostitute)\u2026and her life on the streets of LA\u2026lonely,sad, desperate for companionship,to be noticed,to be paid attention to..to be either a rock star or with a rock star\u2026or swept off her feet by a rock star\u2026she's living a pipe dream,an illusion of her reality and knowing her reality is nothing like her dreams or fantasies\u2026so when she's with her \u201cJohn\u2019s\" she pretends that it's the real thing that she's with a rock star\u2026 she's empty inside\u2026and inside her head she has conversation with herself \u2026. she's the only one who knows how she truly really feels inside about herself\u2026she's very unhappy and alone\u2026she feels that God can't save her or she's not worth saving..so she laughs at the hara chrishners for trying to give her pamphets about salvation..so that's what I get from the song lyrics.

            "answer_text": "The short answer: It was written by Elton and Bernie when they were living in L.A., trying to figure out of they could \u201cbreak into the music business.\u201d Maxine Feibelmann, who was Bernie Taupin's girlfriend when he wrote the song and who became his first wife in 1971. She traveled with the band on their early tours, often sewing together the costumes and fixing their clothes. Plus, on the Madman Across The Water album, it says, \"With love to Maxine\" under the credits for this song. Elton John even said at one point that Bernie wrote it about his girlfriend. But in the larger sense, it was about LA, the end of the sixties, the co opting of the Sunset Strip by Big Money. ",
