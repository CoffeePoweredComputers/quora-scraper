            "answer_text": "My husband\u2014who\u2019s worked in the industry for more than 30 years now\u2014started learning programming when he was five years younger than you are now \u2026 so you\u2019re behind already :-) I\u2019m teasing, of course \u2026. but what I mean is that people even younger than you are doing it, too, so it\u2019s definitely not too early for you to start. How is the issue. First and foremost, I\u2019d start by looking for resources that you may already have around you. For example, when my husband was only nine, he traded a neighbor\u2014who worked for IBM\u2014yard work in exchange for programming lessons. By the time he was your age, that man also hired him to actually program for IBM as a summer intern. If you don\u2019t have any handy friends and/or neighbors to give you a head\u2019s start, then I\u2019\u2019d suggest grabbing a couple of beginning programming books and then start working through the exercises in them. Don\u2019t buy books way over your head because they\u2019re just going to frustrate you. Be honest about your current skill level and start there. And if your math skills aren\u2019t already STRONG, then I\u2019d suggest working on them at the same time. Almost all of programming is math at its core, so if you\u2019re not good at math \u2026 you\u2019re probably going to have problems programming, too. Other than that, look for opportunities to take programming classes elsewhere/everywhere \u2026 even if you\u2019re currently taking computer classes in school. The more the better, and I\u2019m going to be brutally honest here \u2026 the best programmers are the ones who eat, sleep and breathe programming! My husband says his parents had to sit him down at age 12 or so and say, \u201cLook, most of the people at the party don\u2019t want to hear about everything you\u2019re programming right now \u2026 at least, not all night long!\u201d \u2026 *chuckles* It was all HE thought about. He just couldn\u2019t imagine\u2014once he became that obsessed with the topic\u2014why other people wouldn\u2019t be just as excited about it, especially if he explained it to them :-) Finally, if you can\u2019t find classes locally \u2026 look online instead. There are tons of schools that have online education available these days, and\u2014who knows\u2014if you find the right one/talk to your principal, you may be able to get some credit for them in your local school, too. You never know until you ask \u2026 so ask! And good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "There are MANY ways to answer this question... But for me now being 17. If I could go 3 years back, I would go straight into JavaScript. JavaScript is very popular and it's the one language you won't be able to avoid as a programmer/web developer. Along with JavaScript I would play with HTML & CSS. Get comfortable with those 3 things. After that start to research JavaScript frameworks and learn about the back-end if that interests you or if you are dissatisfied with the front-end. For me, I tried programming at 14. I got a Raspberry Pi and after setting up my pi I got really bored, really quick. The reason for that was because I didn't know what I was doing and I got impatient after not getting things to work the way I wanted. Don't let this happen to you. Keep studying. Be persistent. Push through the boring and things only become more interesting. A year later, I began right where I left off. For some reason HTML and CSS made a lot of sense. I don't really know what happened, but my mind was open that day and it clicked. I went crazy, bought a domain name, jonnyporter.com, and made my own website. (It's been updated multiple times since...) That summer I worked really hard saving up money for a new coding bootcamp starting up. After the summer I saved enough money to attend the coding bootcamp. When I got there I thought I knew what I was doing, and then I realized, I knew nothing. Programming was harder than I thought and I didn't persist that well. I questioned what was right for me.  Before the coding bootcamp ended I received a paid internship offer at the same software company my older brother (software developer) worked. When I got there I learned SO much about programming. Not anything about a specific language, just what programming was. I learned that being a programmer is a fine art that must be put to use regularly. You must be patient and put in effort. You may just be 14, but if you are considering coding seriously, this could be some VERY helpful advice for anyone new to programming. Don't grow impatient. Persist. You can do it!Keep an open mind, seek to improve yourself daily.Don't think about what language/framework is best to learn. Just build something.Don't listen to anyone that tells you that you can't do it. You can!Sorry for the long story, but I'm hoping this can give you some insight as a beginner. I really wish I started younger. I already started pretty young at 15 and I'm still wishing I started younger! Good resources are books, blogs and anything related to the subject can help you learn one way or another. Learn to code at codecademy! It's great to get a basic understanding of things. Experience is key! So learn now. Good luck! ",
