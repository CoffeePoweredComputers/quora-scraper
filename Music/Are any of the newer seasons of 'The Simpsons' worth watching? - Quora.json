            "answer_text": "The Simpsons for me has always been the height of \u2018easy-watching television\u2019; you don\u2019t need to concentrate on plot as 99% of episodes end with storylines resolved and back to square one (\u2018Lisa the Vegetarian\u2019 and \u2018Eight Misbehavin\u2019 are 2 notable exceptions.) Many fans have commented on the decline in quality of the show since season 8 (some say ever since season 3!) and I would tend to agree; episodes are forgettable with poor plot gimmicks to fill the 23+ minutes. However I take a certain comfort in having an episode on - maybe it\u2019s the familiarity of the characters and voices that take me back to the memories of the peak seasons\u2026 or maybe it\u2019s the bright colours! I certainly wouldn\u2019t make time to watch any season past the 18th, however if they are on TV and nothing else is on then why not, but lower your expectations and just enjoy the comfort and familiarity that a show over 30 years old can give.

            "answer_text": "No, they have turned the characters into one-dimensional caricatures of their former selves, with characterisation that is unpleasant to the point of repellent. They have got rid of the charmingly surreal elements of the show and replaced them with weirdness of its own sake, while the show has got rid of its clever humour in favour of potty humour, attacks on religion and sexual, racist and other insults.
