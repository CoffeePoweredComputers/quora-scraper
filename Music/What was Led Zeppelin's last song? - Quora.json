            "answer_text": "It depends. The last song on the last studio album: \u201cWearing and Tearing\u201d is the last track on side 2 from the album Coda, released November 19, 1982. Coda was the last studio album, however it was a \u201cthrowaway\u201d album to fulfill Zep\u2019s contractual obligation to Atlantic. No new material had been recorded. Instead, it used unreleased material from 1970 thru December 1978. Wikipedia - Coda (album) The last song recorded in the studio: \u201cOzone Baby\u201d (during the 1978 In Thru the Out Door sessions, but appearing on the Coda album in 1982) was the last completed song of the sessions at Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden in Nov - Dec 1978. I\u2019ve heard this track was the last to receive the final overdubs in late December 1978, and it was the last recording finished by the band. Although I\u2019ve not been able to confirm this anywhere, it\u2019s just rumor. The last live concert song played with all 4 original members (prior to Bonham\u2019s death): \u201cWhole Lotta Love,\u201d an encore at the last show the 4 members would play together on July 7, 1980 in Berlin. This show was 11 weeks prior to Bonham\u2019s death on Sept 25, 1980, and no other shows were played between July 7 and September 25. Here is an audio recording of In The Evening from the last show.  The last known video footage was from the show prior, played on July 5, 1980, in Munich, Germany.  The last rehearsal song played with all 4 original members (prior to Bonham's Death): The band began rehearsing for a tour of the US that was to start on Oct 17, 1980, in Montreal, Canada, at the Montreal Forum. The tour was to be called Led Zeppelin, The 1980s, Part One. LedZeppelin.com - \u201cThe 1980s: Part One\" Tour - Press Release The first rehearsal for this new tour was Sept 24, 1980. I have not been able to find any information on the songs played at this rehearsal, much less what the last song played was at the rehearsal. Although, there were rumors that Carouselambra, from In Thru The Out Door was going to be in the US set and that this first rehearsal focused mostly on that song. However, that is just a rumor. Bonham died in the early morning hours of Sept 25, 1980, just a few hours after this first rehearsal had finished. UltimateClassicRock.com - The Day Led Zeppelin's John Bonham Died The last song ever: \u201cRock and Roll,\u201d at the final show ever played by the 3 surviving members, December 10, 2007. John Bonham\u2019s son, Jason Bonham, played drums for this show.  ",
