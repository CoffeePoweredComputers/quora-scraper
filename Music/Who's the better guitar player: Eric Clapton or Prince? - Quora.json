            "answer_text": "You want to know what really pisses my off is people like Pavlo who say that Prince was competent and that's about it. Really Pavlo? Can you play better than Prince? Anybody who makes statements like that are either haters or just ignorant. When the head of the R&R Hall of Fame says that Prince can match any rock guitarist note for note then that is someone I will listen to. I also had a chance to see Prince jam with a Jazz Fusion band in Minneapolis and he literally just walked in off the street while these guys were performing and walked up to the stage and talked with the band leader for a minute then jumped on stage and started jamming with these guys for about an hour then jumped down and left. He played at least 7\u20138 instruments during that time including guitar and it was brilliant. Prince is an artist that you can\u2019t judge by his albums you need to see him live to see him just really cut loose and strut his stuff. But to get to the question, I will honestly say it is apples and oranges. I have met Clapton twice and even named my first born after him at his suggestion. I\u2019ve always loved him as a guitarist and certainly love his style of playing but truth told Clapton doesn\u2019t even think he is the best ever. Hendrix jammed with his band when he went to London and Eric didn\u2019t even want to go on stage after hearing Jimi playing. Regardless of what some of the people who answered this say Prince was every bit as good as Clapton but I won\u2019t go as far as saying he was better because we are talking about 2 completely different styles of playing. Technically they are both great. In so many respects this is a matter of opinion. Ask 100 great guitarist who is better and you will probably be surprised with the answers. I have done just that and the most consistent response I get is that Eric is truly a legend and one of the best ever but Prince is certainly a more versatile guitarist. They don\u2019t say better just more versatile. Love both Clapton and Prince but I will say that if I could play like either it would be Prince I\u2019d rather play like. He can play any genre of music proficiently and not many guitarist can do that. Even icons like Gene Simmons were humbled by him.  Honestly there is no wrong answer here but for those who don\u2019t think that Prince is in the same league as Clapton, think again. Many of the greatest guitarist in the world would disagree and tell you that Prince was a fantastic guitarist. Both Clapton and Prince deserve to be considered as one of the greatest ever. ",

            "answer_text": "It goes without saying that this is all just my opinion. I\u2019m a big believer in judging people by their best results. Circa 1968, Eric Clapton was God. There were not many guitarists in that idiom at that time who could really be mentioned in the same breath. Buddy Guy, Peter Green, Albert King, and, really, who else? Yes, Jimi Hendrix could be an explosive blues player, but he was much more of an all-around music force and experimenter. (To be clear, yes, I do think Jimi Hendrix was better than Clapton). Prince was a competent guitarist. That\u2019s all I can say. I know people have been losing their minds over one of two silly solos of his that have gone viral (either While My Guitar Gently Weeps or With a Little Help from My Friends), but I really don\u2019t see anything in his guitar work - certainly not in those two perfectly ordinary and even slightly w*nky solos - nor anything else I\u2019ve heard, that is in any way out of the ordinary. Decent, competent guitarist, that\u2019s it. Not bad in any sense, just nothing special. It\u2019s true, Eric Clapton has not put out anything exciting in decades (somebody told me his mid-2000s shows with Winwood were good, I don\u2019t know). I\u2019ve often wondered why this was the case, and some people have suggested heroin was to blame. But (once upon a time, and a very long time ago it was, too) when he was on, as a guitarist, he was ON, and he was unquestionably one of the best on the planet. Prince was a beloved songwriter and all-around icon. That\u2019s enough. We don\u2019t have to claim, as people seem inclined to do, that he was also the best musician in the world on any instrument he chose to touch; he wasn\u2019t. He was never, ever remotely one of the best on the planet on the guitar. And that in no way diminishes him. ",
