            "answer_text": "Irish folk music is internationally recognised, loved and appreciated. It had an enormous role in developing the modern American folk music movement ;Bob Dylan acknowledged the contribution of the Clancy Brothers to his influences. Tap dancing was a fusion of Afro-caribbean dancing and Irish step dancing that emerged from the melting pot that was the 5 Points District in New York. Jazz music is similarly a fusion of Irish and African improvisation. Scottish folk music is best summed up with the Oscar Wilde quote: A gentleman is someone who can play the bagpipes but does not. English folk music had somewhat of a revival in WW1 when morris dancing was taught to soldiers from the trenches. To this day there is widespread debate on the greater cause of percussion shock ( now called PTSD) the German Shelling or the English Folk Music. And before you blow a gaskett: this is just a gentle game of Celtic one-upmanship. But the stuff about English folk is true. ",

To answer your question: I don\u2019t know about English, but Irish folk music is usually played on a fiddle with a kind of drum held in the hand (don\u2019t know what it\u2019s called) as accompanyment. The Scottish folk music is usually played with an accordian accompanyed by fiddles. ",
