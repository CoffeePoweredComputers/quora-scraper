            "answer_text": "Take a look at the product code, if it is Floyd Rose O-1000 then it's the new Made in Korea 1000 series Floyd Rose, it isn't as good as the ones that are made in Germany, and uses zinc alloy sustain block. If the product code is Floyd Rose S-1000 then it's the Floyd Rose Special trem which is a made in Korea 1000 series Floyd Rose trem albeit with cheaper zinc alloy string saddles and zinc alloy sustain block. The ones made in Germany are of substantially better quality than the ones made in Korea. The plating on those Korean ones often flakes off and even the metal used is nowhere as properly hardened as the German ones. Their knife edge also wears off way faster than the made in Germany Floyd Rose trems. Those Korean Floyd Rose trems also use cheap zinc alloy sustain block due to which they have substantially lesser sustain than made in Germany Original Floyd Rose which used brass sustain block. The only Floyd Rose trems that are equally good as the German Floyd Rose trems are the Schaller Lockmeister Floyd Rose trems and the Gotoh 1996T Floyd Rose trems. As of the best Floyd Rose trems, they are undeniably the Vigier Ball-Bearing Floyd Rose, their build quality is even better than the German Floyd Rose and since they use ball bearings instead of knife edges they are way more stable than the Original Floyd Rose. However, the Vigier Floyd Rose is only available on Vigier Guitars and Vigier Guitars cost quite a fortune. ",
