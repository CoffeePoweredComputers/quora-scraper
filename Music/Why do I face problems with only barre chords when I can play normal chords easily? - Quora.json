            "answer_text": "I want you to think about how you started learning Barre Chords on your guitar\u2026 Did you hear about them before you tried them? Were you intimidated by them right from the start? What video(s) did you watch and what lessons did you take in order to learn how to play them? \u2026 Do you even remember? My guess is no. My guess is that all you\u2019re left with are broken Barre Chords and all the common excuses that come along with not being able to play them well. But don\u2019t worry. You\u2019re NOT alone and it\u2019s NOT your fault. This is because most guitarists don\u2019t think about this stuff. You probably just wanted to start playing your favorite songs right away (GOOD) But instead of mapping out exactly how you would do it, you just clicked on and watched the first video you could get your hands on (BAD) In a sea of millions of guitar videos on YouTube, it\u2019s no wonder you never really understood how to play Barre Chords properly. For example, it would say something like \u201cPlay a B Major Barre Chord on String 6 three times\u201d or on a more intense practice day, \u201cPlay every Major Barre Chord on String 6 up and down the fret-board three times.\u201d Make a program similar to gym practice for hands and barre chord practice, this will ensure your hand stretches and practice any one barre chord up-down the fret-board daily. You will see the difference after a week. Stick to the plan,  slowly you will also gain speed. If you\u2019re currently working with a guitar teacher, then please ask him/her for a Practice Plan. You\u2019ll be glad you did!  ",

            "answer_text": "Barre chords require you to press the strings harder against the fretboard. When you don't have enough practice for a long time or if you're simply a relatively inexperienced player, these can be rather hard to play. One thing I can say for sure is that barre chords are definitely easier to play on electric guitars as compared to acoustic ones.  One thing that really worked for me when I was just a beginner (marty schwartz's idea.. Check out his youtube channel) was you just keep playing them. Doesn't matter if it's too hard now or if it sounds a little blunt now. It'll get easier in a couple months I guarantee you.  All the best to your guitar playing.  Cheers!  ",
