            "answer_text": "CIX\u2026 at least in the beginning. (skip down to the end if you want a shorter version)  If you don\u2019t know CIX, they\u2019re a rookie boy group who debuted on July 23rd, 2019 with Movie Star and have had a single comeback since then with Numb. Basically, CIX was formed in a rush and the members knew most of the other members for about four-five months before debut. Bae Jinyoung competed on Produce 101 and made it into Wanna One. C9 (cix\u2019s company) had originally planned on making Jinyoung into a solo artist, and also debuting a boy group later down the line. After Wanna One disbanded, Baejin told C9 that he wanted to debut in a group. Hyunsuk was the only CIX member who\u2019d met Baejin prior to Wanna One disbanding. C9 had already decided to send two of their trainees to Produce X 101, meanwhile the trainee who they had wanted for main vocal left the company. So basically their hands were tied and the company had to quickly find another main vocal and another rapper. Rumors say that C9 had found out about Seunghun through the surrvival show he was on right while Wanna One was about to disband (YG Treasure Box) and had been contacting him while the show was still running. After Seunghun had left YG, he joined C9 sometime in mid-February and met Yonghee, Hyunsuk, and Baejin. Byounggon was also on YG Treasure Box and on the same team as Seunghun, but it\u2019s not as clear as to when or how he joined as he mentioned that Seunghun was already in C9 when he first joined. Yonghee and Hyunsuk were both C9 trainees, however Hyunsuk joined earlier than Yonghee and knew Baejin meanwhile, Yonghee had joined right months before being announced as a CIX (then C9BOYZ) member. CIX started their first group activities about 2.5 months after first meeting each other and debuted about 5 months after meeting each other. The songs for their debuts and the entirety of their alternative universe (portrayed through the Hello Strange Place Story Films) was decided before Byounggon and Seunghun joined the company. They\u2019ve also mentioned that they would play lots of games and straight out just talk for hours to try to get to know each other. When Seunghun first moved in, Baejin asked him about what exactly he wanted in life and they had a long conversation about it. In their earlier vlives, they had this thing called the silent friend who would appear whenever they got so awkward that they couldn\u2019t talk. On the first episode of their pre-debut reality show, they had to fill out profiles for each other and kept asking the staff for help. Overtime, they got closer but at first they kept disassociating with each other. Long Story Short: The only CIX pairs that knew each other before 2019: Byounggon & Seunghun: 4 Years as they were both YG trainees Yonghee & Hyunsuk: 8\u20139 months as C9 trainees Hyunsuk & Baejin: met in passing as they were both in C9. They debuted about five months after meeting each other. At first they were awkward with each other but lately they\u2019ve been getting visibly closer and sharing more with each other. It\u2019s fun to get to see them bond. ",

            "answer_text": "(disclaimer idk the full story to these, I just read some comments about how some members didn\u2019t like each other and I can\u2019t really remember the reasons why, hope that makes sense) 4MinuteI\u2019m pretty sure that the members didn\u2019t like HyunA, probably because Cube favourited her. She got solo songs, and was probably also the center of attention in the media because of how skinny she is. I heard that once 4Minute disbanded the members unfollowed HyunA, and I\u2019m pretty sure that she didn\u2019t celebrate 4Minutes anniversary. Or was it Wonder Girls \ud83e\udd14 idk but that doesn\u2019t make sense, she wasn\u2019t in Wonder Girls for very long. 2. Girls Generation I\u2019m pretty sure that the members didn\u2019t hate each other, but I don\u2019t think they liked Jessica. when Jessica got kicked out the members didn\u2019t keep in Contacted with her (or so I have heard) 3. T-ara i think all the members hated this one member, I can\u2019t remember her name. But I watched a video on it and that member seemed like she wanted to be the center of attention. she sprained her ankle but acted like she broke it, even wearing a cast on it and having to be wheeled by a wheelchair. And then on the night of the concert she stayed in her hotel room getting her nails done. i saw on that documentary that this one member said that she wanted to over shine the members and then go solo and be famous, idk if that\u2019s the same member \u26a0\ufe0fSorry if this information is wrong, I\u2019m just going off of memory\u26a0\ufe0f ",
