            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Hendrix is acknowledged as the master electric guitarist, and the blues were where his heart lay. So clearly he ranks near or at the top. Listen to his wonderfully understated rendition of Bleeding Heart at the Royal Albert Hall in 1969, or the extended Voodoo Chile jam on Electric Ladyland. Both entirely different, both quite unique, both of course improvised off the cuff, both - as a guitarist myself I can tell you - much more difficult to play than you might think. And beautiful. Hendrix has often been cited as the best example of the guitar being an extension of the musician\u2019s body or soul. The oneness with the instrument. The feeling he could inject into his phrasing on a good night was almost miraculous. The Downing Stadium version of Red House from 1970, I must have listened to 1000 times over the years, and it never gets old, always amazes me. In 2019, wonderful players like Matt Schofield are still exhibiting Jimi\u2019s influence on their playing. Yes Matt\u2019s a big big fan of other players, and you can hear their influence in him too - as well as his own unique contribution - but Hendrix is there in aces if you listen. Jim Hendrix stamped his authority, indeed almost reinvented, electric blues in three and a half short years. I agree entirely with others here that Buddy Guy was doing wonderful stuff before him, but I don\u2019t hear the same level of virtuosity in any of Jimi\u2019s contemporaries. Of course he could have bad nights, and there are recordings out there that should never have been released - he led quite a chaotic existence - but on a good night I don\u2019t think he has been equalled even now.

            "answer_text": "He was certainly one of the most innovative guitarists. His emergence had a ripple effect on all of rock and pop music. Countless important guitarists began playing because of him. And, the techniques he helped make popular have been used by many guitarists. With that being said, the world of guitar heroes is very different now from what it was during the 1960s. Virtuoso players aren\u2019t nearly as rare. The internet has helped many become much more technical and has offered them the exposure they many not have been able to get decades ago. Hendrix though remains extremely important, not only because of his skills, but because of creativity. He made three excellent albums. Just like his contemporaries the Beatles and Pink Floyd, he experimented with many different sounds and styles and continued to retain his audience. He is one of the greats! However, as fun as making top 10s is (I personally do it myself) I am not sure that you can weigh how good a guitar player is when compared to the million other guitarists on the planet. ",

            "answer_text": "You\u2019re asking me wrong fella, because I think he is in a class alone. He had a unique hybrid mixture of styles that borrowed from blues, rhythm and blues, jazz and some rock and blended them into his unique sound, leashing it upon us in vast and mighty waves of sonic disturbances. He got our attention and the attention of many in his wake. You can still hear his influence today regardless of being ripped off musically and by the business. So, enjoy if you will! ",

I am not a huge fan of his in particular, but I enjoy his music. When Jimi came along, he played in a way that was so much different than what came before him. He was a trailblazer. He absolutely has to be one of the most influential guitarists of all time. That, to me, is the mark of a great musician. ",

His style was innovative, partly because he played a right-handed Stratocaster left-handed and partly because he played through Marshalls wide-open so if he let go of the strings it would instantly produce feedback. He learned to control that edge-of-feedback sound and use it. That is the part of his style that I picked up and put to my own use, and I\u2019m certainly not the only one to do that. ",
