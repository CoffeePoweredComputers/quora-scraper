            "answer_text": "Thank you for this question. It prompted a little research and I relearned something today. The term is polytonality and from Wikipedia I obtained the following definition and example. Polytonality (also polyharmony (Cole and Schwartz 2012)) is the musical use of more than one key simultaneously. Bitonality is the use of only two different keys at the same time. Polyvalence is the use of more than one harmonic function, from the same key, at the same time (Leeuw 2005, 87).  Example of C and F sharp major chords together in Stravinsky's Petrushka (see: Petrushka chord). Play (help\u00b7info) Some examples of bitonality superimpose fully harmonized sections of music in different keys. I would encourage you to read the entire entry. It\u2019s well written and very interesting. I didn\u2019t realize Bach dabbled in polytonality. How about that? ",

            "answer_text": "yes\u2026 because of a thing called relative minors\u2026 every major key has a minor key that matches it. such as C major and A minor\u2026. they are the same scale. Saying somehting is in A minor is just a way to denote what notes in the scale it has but also where you show perceive the beginning of the scale, but anything in A minor is also in C major. ",

            "answer_text": "At the same time? No. It can change from major to major and viceversa during the song, that\u2019s sure. Also, as major keys have a minor relative, it can be difficult at times to understand if a section of a song is in major or in its relative minor key. ",
