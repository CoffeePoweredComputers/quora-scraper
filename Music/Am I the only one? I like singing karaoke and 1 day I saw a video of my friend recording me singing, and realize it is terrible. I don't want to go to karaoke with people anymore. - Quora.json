Why is it, that when you listen to your voice normally, it sounds fine, but as soon as you listen to it in a voice recording or in a video, you cringe?  Let\u2019s see what google has to say: This is known as bone conduction, meaning that when your vocal cords vibrate to produce speech, that movement also causes the bones of the skull to vibrate, and this, too, is registered in the cochlea. Bone conduction transmits lower frequencies as compared to air conduction, so this is one reason why your voice sounds so unfamiliar when it\u2019s played back to you. When you hear the sound through your own head, your brain perceives it as being lower-pitched than it really is, because the transmission via the skull made it sound that way. Oops- It went above my head \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f In simpler words, The voice in your head, is what you hear all along. It sounds better because it\u2019s in your brain. It\u2019s sort of \u201crefined\u201d, and you are used to it. But when you hear it in a video or recording, you are listening to it from an external source, due to which, you cannot hear the voice you usually hear, the refined one. Sadly, that is the voice that everyone hears when you speak. But, why don\u2019t they cringe when they hear that voice, like I do? That\u2019s actually because, since you listen to a better version of your voice, you\u2019re used to it. Any other version is bound to make you cringe. But other people?They have always heard that voice, they won\u2019t think there\u2019s any difference. Even people who you meet for the first time, they listen to that voice and get used to it. You\u2019re voice may actually be really good, but the reason why you don\u2019t like it, is because you hear a better version of the \u201cgood voice\u201d. So, next time you go to karaoke, enjoy with your friends, and have a good time, because people might really like your voice, and it\u2019s just you who\u2019s not used to the original one. If it helps, don\u2019t take video recordings, and focus on having fun.  ",

            "answer_text": "*I\u2019ve never done karaoke, because it\u2019s not a popular thing to do in my city, but I know people who travelled to nearby cities and had some fun with it there. I think you should give it some time and practice a bit. If you feel self-conscious but don\u2019t live alone, maybe go to a nearby field to sing. Of course, you don\u2019t have to go out and sing karaoke unless you\u2019re comfortable or until you\u2019re ready. From what I\u2019ve heard about karaoke though, it\u2019s more for the fun-ness of it. People are there to have fun and have a laugh, so it\u2019s more about the performer\u2019s stage presence and silliness than how good you voice is. For example, I\u2019ve had years of vocal training and have a pretty good voice, but I know I will absolutely fail at karaoke. I have no stage presence and don\u2019t know how to interact with a crowd. Karaoke is about having fun. People will have fun it they see you having fun. Don\u2019t worry about messing up. ",

            "answer_text": "We never like listening to our own voices. I\u2019m sure you are being overly critical of your own voice. As singers we have a tendency to do that. Our voice doesn\u2019t sound the same on video as it does in our head. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you have a terrible voice. You probably just don\u2019t sound like you thought you did but you still have musicality. If you did, I\u2019m sure one of your friends would have taken you aside by now and said \u201cdude, maybe you need to practice more\u201d or something to that affect. Have your friends been enjoying your time with them at karaoke? Have you been enjoying your time with your friends at karaoke? If the answer is yes to both these questions then I see no reason for you to quit singing karaoke. No one is a perfect singer and the whole point of karaoke is to have fun singing even if you aren\u2019t the next Sean Mendez or Ariana Grande. So let loose and have fun!\ud83c\udfb6\ud83c\udfa4\ud83e\udd70 ",
