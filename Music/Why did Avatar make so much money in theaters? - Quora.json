            "answer_text": "Of course because Avatar did something that no movie did at the time, it brought the 3D technology to another level and successfully made everyone want to experience it in theaters. It was a standalone movie meaning no previous films needed to be watched to understand it. It also wasn't an R-rated film, so people of any age can go watch it at any time whenever they please to.Didn't have a fan base or a limited of fans like other franchise which makes it unpredictable to know how it would turn out.Since it didn't have a fan base, no one expected much from it or knew anything about it before, until everyone actually watched it in theaters.It was culturally accepted and had such an universal appeal which all caused CRAZY REPEAT VIEWINGS!!",
