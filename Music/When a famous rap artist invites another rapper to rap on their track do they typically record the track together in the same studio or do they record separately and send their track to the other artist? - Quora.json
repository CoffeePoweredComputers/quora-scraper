            "answer_text": "Usually they record together, if schedules dont permit they will have the producer to \"lay it on the track\".  I honestly think they like to get into the studio together because they feed off of one another.  I have found that they are more likely to not record with a DJ, for mixed tapes they just send it in.  The only DJ that I have seen get respect in terms of studio time was DJ WHOKID ...I imagine now DJ Khaled commands that respect now.  TIs DJ had that respect before the feds raided him, I am not sure if he still DJs. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm pretty sure that many many rappers these days email (or however else they want to send it) their verses to each other since being in the studio together anymore is no longer necessary.  Save someone like Kanye West, who has recorded his last two albums in discreet locations, requiring collaborators to join him at those locations, I feel like most artists use this flexibility to their advantage, and it allows for more collaborations between artists for the end listener ",
