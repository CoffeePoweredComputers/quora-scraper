            "answer_text": "That is up for individual Christians to decide. There is nothing inherently anti-Biblical about the instrumentation. The lyrics are more likely to be a sticking point. Many rock songs have frequent references to sex and drugs (though rock is pretty tame compared to hip hop). If you don\u2019t like that in songs, don\u2019t listen to them. But there are artists who don\u2019t include those references; it\u2019s been rarer in more recent rock records. And another point: music on its own does not influence how people behave. Did the 1969 song \u201cSister Morphine\u201d by The Rolling Stones really lead to an increase in people taking morphine? No, but decades later, problems in a healthcare system did. In my neighbourhood, the local church does music with a folk rock accompaniment: usually an acoustic guitar, piano, bass and drums. Although it also does a fortnightly quiet service accompanied by just a piano. This has continued through the pandemic. ",

            "answer_text": "About listening to rock music, I guess it is important to know what our motivation is. I think it is important to not sucked into worldly things, but as Christians our primary job is love people. Loving people is more important than feeling self righteous about various rules that we follow. As Jesus said \u201cthey will know you are Christians by your love\u201d, Jn13:35. So if listening to some rock music can help us relate better to people and actually love them, then I can\u2019t see what is wrong with it. However, it is also important to not waste time on trivia either, Ephesians 5:16. If we follow Jesus, there is a lot of freedom that we get , but it is important to not abuse that freedom. As Paul said \u201cdo not use your freedom selfishly\u201d Galatians 5:13. As I said at the beginning, it comes down to our motives, as to why we are doing anything. I think the motivation to love others and God should be our primary motives no matter what we do. ",
