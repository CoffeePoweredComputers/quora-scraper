            "answer_text": " Vietnam. They currently have the largest banknote denomination in the world. This is 500,000 VND polymer banknote. 1 USD is currently 22,727.50 VND. So, the banknote above is 22 USD. But, the Vietnamese currency is only the second least-valued currency in the world.  Iranian rial is the world\u2019s least-valued currency. The rial dropped significantly against US Dollar in 2014. Currently, 1 USD is 32,844 IRR. That makes the 100,000 IRR banknote above equals to 3.04 USD.   I come from Indonesia, the country with the world\u2019s third least-valued currency. The two banknotes above are 100,000 IDR banknotes and both are circulating now. With 1 USD equals to 13,349 IDR, the banknote above each is worth 7.49 USD. https://www.google.co.id/search?client=tablet-android-samsung&ei=l4qRWarxBIjXvgTy47aQAw&q=1+USD+to+IDR&oq=1+USD+to+IDR&gs_l=mobile-gws-serp.3..35i39k1j0l4.157447.159008.0.159283.7.6.1.0.0.0.257.1002.0j4j1.5.0....0...1.1j4.64.mobile-gws-serp..2.5.846...0i10k1j0i20k1j0i67k1.KDagGGov0TM https://www.google.co.id/search?client=tablet-android-samsung&ei=EIqRWaTFBcHzvgSv3ZXgAQ&q=1+USD+to+IRR&oq=1+USD+to+IRR&gs_l=mobile-gws-serp.3..0j0i22i30k1j0i22i10i30k1l2j0i22i30k1.129435.131433.0.132287.7.7.0.0.0.0.198.1004.0j6.6.0....0...1.1j4.64.mobile-gws-serp..2.5.867...35i39k1j0i67k1j0i10k1j0i20k1.hIN71lDgHro https://www.google.co.id/search?client=tablet-android-samsung&ei=B4qRWZm-IMruvAStrZ3ADQ&q=1+USD+to+VND&oq=1+USD+to+VND&gs_l=mobile-gws-serp.3..0i67k1j0l4.1506.5670.0.5873.15.15.1.1.1.0.319.2238.0j7j3j1.11.0....0...1.1j4.64.mobile-gws-serp..3.12.2316.3..35i39k1j0i131i67k1j35i39i70k1.hbPJeScjZvY ",
