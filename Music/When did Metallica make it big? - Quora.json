            "answer_text": "That depends on what you mean by \u201cmake it big.\u201d Let\u2019s use a typical benchmark for band popularity: Arena shows. Meaning, the band\u2019s ability to play the larger arenas (basketball/hockey arenas) that hold more than 10,000 people or more. Metallica became popular enough to headline arena shows after the release of their fourth studio album \u201cAnd Justice For All\u201d in 1988. What helped their popularity tremendously was the video for their song \u201cOne\u201d from this album, which garnered tons of MTV play and introduced them to a whole new group of fans. They had already achieved a great deal of underground popularity, and prior to \u201cAnd Justice For All\u201d they were playing small theaters (capacity of 4,000\u20136,000, roughly) following the release of what many consider to be their \u201cbest\u201d album, \u201cMaster of Puppets.\u201d But with the release of \u201cAnd Justice For All\u201d and the video for \u201cOne,\u201d they were an arena-headlining band that had indeed \u201cmade it big.\u201d Now, they entered an entirely different stratosphere with the release of the \u201cBlack Album\u201d in 1991. That album sold 16.4 million copies worldwide and cemented them as the most popular heavy metal band of all time, bar none. But the \u201cBlack Album\u201d didn\u2019t make them an arena band, they already were. ",

            "answer_text": "People were accusing Metallica of selling out during Master Of Puppets, which is kinda bullshit. They were accused of this because they had released on a major record label (Elektra Records) The fans started to realize that Metallica wasn\u2019t underground anymore, and that they were going to explode and that they did. \u2026And Justice For All sold 15,840,000 million copies! (GLOBALLY!!) Which continued to spring Metallica into popularity until it happened\u2026THE BLACK ALBUM! This is by far Metallica\u2019s most popular album, this is the album that people know songs off of. This is when they REALLY sold out, this was also the first album that didn\u2019t have Metallica\u2019s Thrash Metal roots in it, it was more on the heavy metal and hard rock side. This album has most of Metallica\u2019s popular songs on it\u2026 Did someone say\u2026Enter Sandman and Nothing Else Matters? This album has 30,379,000 million sales globally, compare that to the 8,510,000 sales that Kill \u2019Em All had, so the Black Album was when Metallica really boosted themselves into the spotlight.
