            "answer_text": "It is a pretty tough thing to decide between these two music streaming services, and also i would like to add Apple Music service introduced by Apple, in this discussion.  So first talking about the content.  There is not much difference when its comes to the selection and the quantity of tracks or albums all these services have. They all have bazillion number of songs which you can enjoy for months without repeating. What make them slightly different from each other are some unique features that they have. Price :- The cost of all the services is same, that is each service costs $10/month for unlimited streaming. Even the family packs of all the services are of same cost, $15/month. Unique Features :- Google Play Music Along with a google play music subscription, you will get free access of googles another service called You Tube Red, which can be explained as add free YOUTUBE. You Tube Red also has some exclusive content which is not available in basic Youtube websit or app.You can also upload upto 50,000 songs in google play music catalog, so it is great platform for upcoming talents.Spotify  You can share your playlists with your friends through different social platforms.You can download songs for offline playing.Also there is free service, in which you can listen to unlimited songs, in trade with some audio and visual advertisements.50% off for Students.Apple Great and easy to handle interface.And if you are an apple household then icloud could be a great advantage.So guys these were the main differences, each service has some good features, i personally prefer Spotify as it seems much friendly to me, but you can choose anyone according to your device compatibility. Do comment if you have any other question :) Thankyou! ",

            "answer_text": "In my experience, Spotify has a social element and a discovery element that I really missed when switching to Google Play All-Access. Turns out, I used pre-made playlists a lot when I had Spotify. The music selection is roughly the same, though. Plus, Google Play All-Access comes with YouTube Red, which is a HUGE plus. All told, I think it's a matter of preference. Luckily, they both have a 30-day trial, which I would recommend. ",
