            "answer_text": "Tears in Heaven is oft considered by people to be a love song. But it was written by Eric \"the God\" Clapton as a final farewell to his 4-year old who tragically died. Once you are aware of this, every rendition of the song stirs up a sea of emotions. Hallelujah is one of the most famous and most covered songs. The 6 most popular versions - the original by Leonard Cohen, and covers by Jeff Buckley, Rufus Wainwright, K D Lang, Alexandra Burke and John Cale - are all mesmerising. The song has this effect on you where you suddenly feel at peace and yet can vaguely sense a great tumult in your soul.   Mad World by Gary Jules is a commentary on the current state of things where everyone's in a rush to be somewhere. In the race to get ahead, we have somehow devolved from being human beings to shallow shells, to mindless automatons going from work to home and back. Hurt by Johnny Cash (original by Nine Inch Nails) was recorded when Cash was 70 years old. His rendition has a spooky, eerie feeling to it - the sense of impending doom, the creepy feeling of the reaper waiting on you.  Skinny Love by Bon Iver is a love song like no other. An ode to a failing relationship, a desperate plea to a lover drifting away, a final clutch at the straws to save a drowning love.  John Wayne Gacy Jr. is the story of serial killer by the same name. Sufjan Stevens's haunting voice is perfect for the song that tries to expose the evil lurking beneath the calm exterior of a everyday man. The Sound of Silence by Simon and Garfunkel is another masterpiece on how everyone seems to be moving apart. It unveils the bitter fact that despite being in the company of 7 billion other souls on a tiny planet, we have somehow managed to slowly transform into human islands - surrounded by virtual friends and virtual lives whilst successfully evading the reality. The Drugs Don't Work. The Verve is a criminally underrated band. It centers around drug-addiction and how it slowly destroys a person, his life and everything he holds dear. Almost anything by Radiohead  Also, you should try some good post rock bands. Their music, while not exactly sad, makes you sit down, look around and introspect about your life, past and present. As a first time listener, go to Youtube and listen to Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Mogwai, Sigur Ros, Explosions in the sky, Mono, God is an Astronaut, Caspian, The Evpatoria Report, Yndi Halda. ",
