If the track is less than 30 seconds, even if you listen to the entire track the artist will not receive royalties. 30 seconds is the minimum amount of listening required for Spotify to count it as one \u201clisten\u201d for the sake of money. By listening I mean the song has to play for 30 seconds. It can be on mute, max volume, or via headphones, it doesn\u2019t matter. ",
