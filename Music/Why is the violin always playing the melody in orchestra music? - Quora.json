            "answer_text": "Why is the violin always playing the melody in orchestra music? There is no \u201cviolin always playing the melody\u201d in orchestra music. I don\u2019t know what you have been listening to, but, unless it is a concerto or other piece designed specifically for solo violin, there is no violin playing the melody. Even when a solo violin is featured, such as a concerto, it does not always play the main melody and might, instead, play ornamental figures or bridge sections. Often in orchestral music the first violin section will carry the melody, but that is usually a large group of musicians, not a soloist, and, even then, they do not always play the melody\u2014that would be very boring indeed. Instead, in orchestral music different instruments or groups of instruments will be featured in different sections of the work. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. I believe you might be referring to the fact that in percentage the violins seem to be the ones who get the melody most of the times. While this is true for a lot of classical (as in of the classical period) and romantic music, it is also true that composers alternated them with other instruments, including the saxophone (which remains a rare breed in a symphonic work nevertheless). The electric or bass guitar came relatively recently, certainly too recently to be included in works by Mozart or Brahms or Ravel. Bernstein used the electric guitar in West Side Story. ",
