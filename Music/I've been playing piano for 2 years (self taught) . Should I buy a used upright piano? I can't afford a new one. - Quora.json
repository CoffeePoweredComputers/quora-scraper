            "answer_text": "There are numerous pianos out there many of them for free, or near free. The problem is not all of them are playable or serviceable. There are also hidden costs associated with free pianos, such as the cost of moving and tuning it after it\u2019s moved. So what does all this mean? Getting a bargain on a used upright piano right now is very doable, but pick wisely and don\u2019t jump on the first clunker that pops up. Take your time look for a piano that has been cared for and regularly tuned, actually play the instrument before you buy, and be sure to play every note. If at all possible take a professional Piano service technician (you will have to pay him for his time) with you to give you a good assessment of the pianos condition. Many piano techs also sell pianos they have already serviced and reconditioned, These will cost you a little more but are a much safer choice. So definately don\u2019t shy away from the used upright piano market, but do take your time and choose wisely. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi. My first piano was \u00a320 an electric 60 key basic piano. It gave me the confirmation that I wanted to learn. Then bought a German upright from gumtree \u00a3100. The bought a better electric weighted 85 keys gumtree \u00a3120 this allows me to practice anytime. Then I bought a Broadwood this was a mistake I didn't do enough homework the keyboard was very low gave me backache. Then the saddest time of my life last May I lost my dear heart, my mom who encouraged me to learn. Many years ago I loaned my parents some money never wanted it back but she insisted. I agreed to take it months before I lost her only if I could buy a piano. I bought serenity my dream upright 1925 Steinway. I have only been playing for almost 4 years but an acoustic piano lives an electric one doesn't but it is individual choice. Happy playing Blessings to you ",
