            "answer_text": "If you are going to do a self-introduction, It would be best to first, do it in Korean. Even if you have to use google translate, or have a friend translate it for you, this will also show to the company that you have an interest in the language. I would first, say your name, then nationality, then say \u201ctoday I will be singing _______\u201d You do not need to tell them how long you will be singing for because they will have a general idea from the video length. also, if you do decide to do it in Korean pronunciation is key! you do not want to start mumbling and have them not understand a single word you are saying. I hope this helped you!!! ",
