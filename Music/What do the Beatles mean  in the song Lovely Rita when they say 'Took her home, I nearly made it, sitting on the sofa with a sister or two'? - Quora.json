            "answer_text": "As with so many Beatles lyrics it appears to be a throw-away line then, when you stop to think about it, it fits into the song very well and has some nice qualities. This is about a guy who might fit in well as one of the scientists in The Big Band Theory. He has a crush on the parking meter lady but has real problems as an Englishman dealing with the so-called swinging sixties (as in \"May I Enquire Discreetly, When Are You Free To Take Some Tea With Me?\").  The line that you are referring to has him sounding like a real hotshot with women, boasting that he nearly made it (in other words he didn't) on the sofa, hinting that with her two sisters it was nearly an unforgettable experience - except that nothing happened. Add to that the musicality and aliteration of the rat-a-tat-tat sound of \"sitting on the sofa with a sister or two\". This almost single note passage is in complete contrast to the amazing melody line of \"Lovely Rita Meter Maid, Nothing Can Come Between Us\" - only Paul could have composed this. I leave it to the reader to understand what the last passage of this song is about - again the singer is hinting that it was an amazing end to the evening, but perhaps it was just a fantasy. At least Rita paid the bill for dinner, she must have felt sorry for him! I'm not saying this was all carefully worked out by Paul (and possibly John helped refine the lyrics) - but many Beatle songs can be appreciated at multiple levels, which is a tribute to the spontaneous and instinctive musicality and lyric writing skills that Paul and John had, which were never at a higher level than on this album.

But let\u2019s look at the line carefully (observing all punctuation marks): \u201cTook her home\u201d - Obviously, as a gentleman, he made sure that she got home safely.\u201cI nearly made it\u201d - Barely got her home on time. Now, many may see this as him not getting to \u201cfirst base\u201d or even \u201cscoring\u201d with the young lady, but has anyone thought that maybe, it was quite late in evening when she (Rita) was getting back home? Which would be why\u2026\u201cSitting on a sofa with a sister or two\u201d - Rita did not live alone, and they (the sisters; older than she-maybe spinsters) were waiting up for her. Rita invites the gentleman in for tea, before they call it a night. And, like any awkward moment, he probably had to deal with the third degree interrogation questions.",
