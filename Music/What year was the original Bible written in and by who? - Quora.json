            "answer_text": "No one sat down and wrote the whole Bible at any one time. The Bible which most people are familiar is an amalgam of 66 books and even that is not set in stone historically. The older Hebrew bible (current Old Testament) had some of the minor prophets together as well as 1st and 2nd Kings and others and so had a different number of \u2018books\u2019. We don\u2019t know about the \u201coriginal\u201d texts of ANY of the books in the Old or New Testaments. We don\u2019t have any originals and don\u2019t know precisely when they were written. I have studied textual transmission, linguistics, textual criticism, Hebrew and Greek as well as biblical theology at the PhD level. I think a very strong case can be made that most all the Old Testament was written in Hebrew around 6th century BC or LATER. The oldest biblical manuscripts in Hebrew that we have are 2nd to 3rd century BC and we didn\u2019t have those until the Dead Sea Scrolls. By the way, there is more non-biblical material in the Scrolls than biblical material. The oldest copy we have of the Old Testament put together completely pretty much as we know it (in Hebrew) is dated around 900 AD. Obviously the first English translation comes from Tyndale\u2019s time hundreds of years later. There must have been some traditions which gave rise to the written Old Testament text so oral traditions of some kind were in existence for\u2026who knows how long? But the best evidence suggests that even these traditions likely came about after the Jews were taken in exile around 597 BC. It seems they started interpreting their world and history through that experience. Even the Tower of Babel story (one of the oldest in the OT) likely was inspired by the zigguraut (tower) of Nebuchadnezzar and the Jews heard the different languages around them in Babylon and wondered why there were different dialects. By the way, they probably became familiar with older Babylonian Flood stories then as well (see \u201cThe Ark Before Noah\u201d by Irwin Finkel Anchor Books 2014 pp. 224\u2013260). Scholarship generally agrees the books of the New Testament were likely written in the mid-to-late first century- perhaps into the second century AD. Most think 1 Thessalonians is best candidate for being written first- maybe late 50s. No one knows for sure who wrote the Gospels- but earliest evidence from the Church Fathers makes a pretty good case for the names we have attached to them (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) though Barth Ehrman makes a strong case which calls that into question. But notice all of the \u201cthink\u201d and \u201cbest guess\u201d in my comments above? We don\u2019t know\u2026and never will. We are left with copies many times removed from any originals and translated into our language- which believe me is hardly an exact science. So as you can see, your question reflects some very basic misunderstandings of what the Bible is textually and how we came to have our form of it today. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two answers to who wrote the Bible. As a divine document, its words ultimately come from God. Second Timothy 3:16 teaches the Bible is God-breathed. Second Peter 1:20-21 reveals, \u201cNo prophecy of Scripture comes from someone's own interpretation. For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.\u201d God directed the human authors of the Bible, using their own writing styles and personalities to produce the words of His choosing. The human authors involved include approximately 40 writers of diverse backgrounds and locations over the course of 1,500 years. Isaiah was a prophet, Ezra was a priest, Matthew was a tax collector, John was a fisherman, Moses was a shepherd, and Luke was a physician. Despite such variety, the Bible teaches consistently and without contradiction on a wide range of issues. The authors each present different perspectives, yet they all proclaim the same God and the same singular path of salvation\u2014Jesus Christ (John 3:16; 14:6; Acts 4:12). Some books of the Bible specify their author by name. Below is a list of each book followed by the name of its author and the approximate date of its writing.

(author and date uncertain)Psalms = several different authors, approximately half by David around 1000 B.C. (the earliest psalm is from Moses around 1400 B.C.; the latest around 400 B.C.)Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon = Solomon - 900 B.C.Isaiah = Isaiah - 700 B.C.Jeremiah, Lamentations = Jeremiah - 600 B.C.Ezekiel = Ezekiel - 550 B.C.Daniel = Daniel - 550 B.C.Hosea = Hosea - 750 B.C.Joel = Joel - 850 B.C.Amos = Amos - 750 B.C.Obadiah = Obadiah - 600 B.C.Jonah = Jonah - 700 B.C.Micah = Micah - 700 B.C.Nahum = Nahum - 650 B.C.Habakkuk = Habakkuk - 600 B.C.Zephaniah = Zephaniah - 650 B.C.Haggai = Haggai - 520 B.C.Zechariah = Zechariah - 500 B.C.Malachi = Malachi - 430 B.C.
