            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve used them both, but haven\u2019t opened Songster up in years. I think UG is better at making lists you want to keep track of, you can have personal tabs, when you transcribe a song they will look up the lyrics for it for you, and I can\u2019t believe how deep that feature goes, because I\u2019m usually doing something a little obscure. There were just more of what I was looking for on UG. But there are a lot commenters on there that seem to be a little anal about the transcriptions in the key \u201cthey play it on the record\u201d though. I\u2019m gonna have it in the key that I can sing it in, if I take the trouble of transcribing something. But there\u2019s also some good conductive criticisms and suggestions from other users. As far as bad transcriptions goes, yeah, there are a lot of those, but even bad ones can give you a place to start. Plus, you can always take a sad song, and make it better. Sorry, couldn\u2019t help it. That was a reference to the 60\u2019s rock band The Beatles, kids. ",

            "answer_text": "I do not like Ultimate guitar at all. Too many poor \u201ctranscriptions\u201d, wrong chords, often wrong words, and simply a mess. Songsterr I found long ago, and while it is better, there are still issues - because, like UG, the material is submitted by people who may or may not know what they are doing\u2026who may not understand exactly what is being played, sonically. So, I have my own ears, honed over 50 and more years in playing and transcribing music, knowing theory, and so understanding harmonic motion and relationships - what is actually going on sonically. I create my own transcriptions. On some occasions, when I\u2019m feeling lazy, I\u2019ll use Guitar Instructor because they have licensed official transcripts from the publishing houses/labels of the artists involved. ",
