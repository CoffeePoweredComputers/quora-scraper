            "answer_text": "Korea and Japan are the only developed countries in Asia, and Japan has always had some of the weirdest fetishes when it comes to pop culture. Korean companies have the resources, capital, and infrastructure to produce and export K-pop more successfully than other Asian countries. The ArtistsIn contrast to American artists, Asian music targeted towards young people is heavily focused on \"idols\", who are not so much singers as all around entertainers. Instead of simply enjoying their music, fans of K-pop indulge in an overdose of their favorite idols. Compared to regular American artists, idols: Be physically attractive (face and body).Put out catchy music, regardless of actual vocal abilities. Catchy song = cha-ching$!$!Dance to catchy choreography completely in sync with all members in the idol group. YouTube is riddled with dance covers from international fans.Act in dramas, regardless of actual acting ability.Model in CFs (commercials).Appear on variety programs (talk shows, weird funny shows, game shows, etc.)Guest on radio programsDJ or MC radio programs and TV programsPerform 4+ times a week on music TV programsPerform weekly at different events at amusement parks, university festivals/celebrations, other private events(for the popular idols) Hold concerts all over Asia (or the world even)Hold fan meetings, which include performances and playing games with fansHold fan signings at sponsor eventsActively promote in other countries around Asia (or the world)etc.In contrast American artists: Put out an album/music videoHave a tourThat's itFor consumers, there are tons of more reasons to start liking a K-pop idol than an American artist. The Companies K-pop is dominated by the \"big 3\" companies: SM, JYP, and YG. In contrast with American agencies, which identify musical talent/potential and work with the artists to produce music, Korean entertainment companies recruit and manufacture these idols. Children/teens chosen to be celebrities train for years learning to sing/rap, practicing dancing/acting, foreign languages, dieting, getting plastic surgery, etc. all in preparation for idoldom\u2014but very few of them make it through the final cut. This manufacturing process is what makes idols into the gods/goddesses that fans worship and drool over. But unfortunately, no system is perfect. First of all, this idol manufacturing system is extremely expensive and time consuming for obvious reasons. Furthermore, the massive amount of responsibilities I listed above is immensely taxing to the idols. Idols are humans, too. It's not uncommon for idols to get only 2-4 hours of sleep a day. No wonder idol groups tend to break up or have other troubles. Culture Of course, Asian cultures have more in common with each other than with American artists, so it follows that they might enjoy Asian artists over American ones.  What are American songs about? Sex, drugs, getting drunk, partying, grinding on girls, more sex, maybe even some BDSM thrown in, getting naughty with a shorty, etc. Korean idols are much more culture-friendly in comparison. They sing about innocently falling in love, having a crush, etc. Sometimes they'll have a mention of soju or sexy girls, but nothing to the extent of American music. The government itself censors music and music videos, as well. TDLR Korean idols are all around entertainers that fans love and worshipCompanies work hard to train and manufacture these idolsK-pop is more Asian culture-friendly than American music",

            "answer_text": "Because the Korean government gives KPOP unprecedented backing and support, so it can be exported abroad. The government wants people in the region to consume this content not only for economic but also for political reasons (soft power). This cultural export is referred to \u201cHallyu\u201d (Korean wave) and is methodically analyzed, cultivated, and monitored. In fact here is a government foundation website dedicated to it: Korea Foundation for International Culture ExchangeEntertainment is an effective way to influence the economies and sentiments of foreign nations to buy and favor Korean products and ideas. KPOP is Korea\u2019s soft power and fans can now be rallied for geopolitical influence. As farfetched as that sounds, K-pop fans have a long history of online activism, so much so they were even credited for disrupting Donald Trump\u2019s June 2020 election rally in Oklahoma. Below are two common points usually cited for why KPOP is popular in Asia, so let\u2019s get these out of the way: High production value & budgets that rival American music entertainment. In the early stages KPOP heavily sampled US entertainment formulas for success, and had many top US choreographers, producers, and consultants flown to Korea to assist and fine-tune the industry\u2019s recipes.Very attractive Asian-looking talent that is selected in calculated ways. Talent is incubated, farmed, and groomed to be appealing and adopt whatever mannerisms, personalities, quirks, and skills that will appeal to a wide range of key audiences, this is furthered by surgical enhancements, diets, and personal training if necessary.Below are the less obvious reasons, especially to fans, but are why the Korean central government gives unprecedented support for KPOP to be exported. Economic - KPOP is often the backbone of key growth sectors driving billions of dollars into the Korean economy, such as tourism, medical tourism (plastic surgery), beauty, fashion, and intangible assets such as entertainment brands, digital contents, media and broadcast licensing rights, all of which further Koreas \u201cCreative Economy\u201d initiative: a push to move away from a manufacturing economy to instead a service, intangible assets, contents, and idea-based economy.Diplomatic - KPOP is Korea\u2019s soft power, unlike hard power (ability to use coercion via military might or economic sanctions). It can instead infectiously penetrate and influence a wide variety of foreign citizens to hold Korea in high positive regard, especially since KPOP content is tightly monitored, controlled, and censored to maintain Korea\u2019s national narrative. This would make it difficult for foreign governments to take negative actions towards Korea if many of its own citizens like Korea. In fact, this is currently being put to the test as Korea deploys the US military missile defense system, THAAD, which the Chinese government is displeased with and is beginning to censor KPOP as a result. KPOP has been so entrenched in China that Chinese citizens may show unrest due to their government reacting negatively towards Korea, especially if that means taking away their KPOP.Entertainment is an effective way to influence the economies and sentiments of foreign nations to buy and favor Korean products and ideas. Foreign KPOP fandoms have virtually become a proxy online brigade of crowdsourced PR agents, ambassadors, and diplomats protecting Korea\u2019s image 24\u20137.
