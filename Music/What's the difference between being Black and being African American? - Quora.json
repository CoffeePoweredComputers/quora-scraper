            "answer_text": "I'll try to be as thoughtful as possible with my response. Consider: African-Americans descend from an African, free and enslaved.An African descends from an African who was born in Africa.African-Americans aren't born in Africa. They are born in America.African-Americans and Africans are typically perceived as black. However, Africans and African-Americans come in a variety of colors.There is no single phenotype or phenotypic-mix that defines Africans or African-Americans. They are very diverse people, but Africans more so.African-Americans typically speak American English (their primary language); however, some African-Americans have Spanish as their primary language. I would imagine that there are some Africans who have Spanish as a primary language because of the Spanish conquest in Africa.Africans and African-Americans understand what it means to live in an oppressive and brutal system created by non-blacks based on skin color. However, the benefactors of their respective systems were/are different.Most Africans know their history while most African-Americans don't.Most African-Americans share genes with both non-Africans and Africans, while most Africans only share genes with Africans and African-Americans.Africans sold the ancestors of captured African-Americans to the Spanish, Portuguese, and English, who transitioned the ancestors of captured African-Americans into slavery systems. African-Americans did not.African-Americans have enslaved no one.African-Americans generally see black people (inside and outside the African diaspora) as part of a larger black family. Some Africans continue to have a tribal view and do not.Some African-Americans do not see themselves as African at all. I would disagree with that notion. There's tremendous opportunity for African-Americans to reconnect with Africa \u2014 especially West Africa \u2014 in a meaningful way.There are millions of Americans self-proclaiming to be \u201cwhite\u201d who are African-American and I would doubt the same is occurring in Africa.Unlike most Africans from Africa, there are a small number of African-Americans (like myself) who also descend from Neanderthals.I think that's enough. All humans are African or descend from Africans. All humans are beautiful. We are more alike than we differ. ",

            "answer_text": "The difference is simply this my dear, African Americans are people who live in America that have African ancestry. Black people are people that have dark skin anywhere in the world. HOWEVER, I think that it\u2019s worth noting that in the United States, typically those who refer to themselves as being African American know what specific country in Africa from which their ancestors came, or that they themselves immigrated from. Typically you find black people in the United States (due to the lack of records kept on sales during the slavery era in the United States) calling themselves that because they may not know what exact country they may come from, or even want to distance themselves from their ancestry in Africa because they do not know. Or in some cases black people in the U.S. have some pent up hatred of people in Africa because of the tales in the U.S. history books that say that African people sold their ancestors to slavery. While the terms above would suffice to answer your question I find that when you dig deeper into the psychology behind it you\u2019ll find that many people in the U.S. at least refer to these terms in their own way because of some underlying reasoning. Those people that refer to themselves as \u2018woke\u2019 or say that their ancestors were from Nigeria or Morocco are typically those who refer to themselves as African American, while those who call themselves black do not. I hope this helps. ",
