            "answer_text": "Original question: Why do bands sound so different in concert than on the record? Do they do it on purpose? The most notable reason is that it is next to impossible for them to have it sound the same as on the record. The acoustics of the concert hall vs. the acoustics of the living room (or headset!) on which you listened to the record are so completely different that even if you played the record there, it would still sound different. But records are crafted to have a given sound \u2014 perhaps through much repetition, layering of parts, even addition of auxiliary musicians as, perhaps, strings or horns \u2014 replicating all of those techniques and instrumentation would likely be difficult or costly, particularly given that each song is crafted separately on the album. I would add another reason, which is an extension or the above \u2014 because they don\u2019t have to. Most people view a concert as an experience to itself, not a chance to hear what they could have just stayed home and listened to. The performance, the dynamics, the showmanship, all add to a unique experience which most people treasure live shows for and few go home disappointed that it didn\u2019t sound like the record \u2014 they only go home disappointed if the band put on a bad show. And finally, though there are always some very discriminating listeners, most people would either not know or not care about the changes. I\u2019ve pointed out several times that aspiring cover band players often get very hung up on how to produce exactly the same tone that NameYourFavoriteMusician had on this song or that whereas I have seen a lot of working cover bands where the guitarist brought in one guitar, one amplifier and perhaps two or three pedals and proceeded to play three or four sets of music by diverse artists, recorded on diverse instruments, in diverse studios, etc. and they rarely even touched a tone control. The mind recognizes the familiar song and it resonates with it even if the sound isn\u2019t all that familiar. Replicating a killer tone or other signature aspect of a song might be a nice accomplishment but it really isn\u2019t the most important thing in a live performance. ",

            "answer_text": "If you take a recording of some sort, play it at a live performance volume in a different club, stadium, etc. every thru the very same sound system, it will ALWAYS sound different even though you use the very same settings on all the mixer controls. Its just the reality of sound. The person playing his instrument in the group may think he\u2019s sounding the same each night thru his small stage amp, but theres sooo many variables with location and settings for micing that it will ALWAYS sound different. PLus theres soo many extraneous sounds and effects going on nearby. He may not be hearing it so he\u2019s playing louder and this will remove his sound from the original setting. His strings may be another two or three days older which actually effects his sound or might be trying a new pickup setting. He plays the same stuff every night and he\u2019s bored so he does something different to try to improve. And the mixer, who is actually an artist of utmost import is totally bouncing the controls around to improve what he\u2019s hearing where he is sitting, which is obviously diff every night. Soo, he\u2019s constantly moving controls to get it better in this location. Throw in some human stuff like egos making people throw volumes arund wrecklessly, adding pedal switches to test for interest and experimenting, or who\u2019d doing speed, who doing heroin, etc. and it gets funky VERY quickly. And to be honest, theres soooo much more going on that the complexity of it is unbelieveable. Honest! I could go on forever but I have dealt with it and am VERY familiar with a lot of it. It drives one NUTS! Oh yeah, the mix is for 2 locations, one on stage and the other out-front which causes confusion exponentially. HOpe this helps ya! ",
