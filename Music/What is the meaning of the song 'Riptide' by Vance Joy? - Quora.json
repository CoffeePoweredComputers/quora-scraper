            "answer_text": "\"I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations\" meaning he'd conquered that fear and now he's found her. \"All my friends are turning green\" His friends are jealous because he has this beautiful girlfriend.  \"Lady, running down to the riptide, Taken away to the dark side\". His girlfriend gets caught up with bad people or an addiction or something that is changing her ways.  \" i wanna be your left hand man\" But he loves her so much he'll still stay and help her no matter what happens \" I love you, when you're singing that song, and I've got a lump in my throat, Cos your gonna sing the words wrong\" The relationship starts going downhill because she's saying things and doing things that are out of character. It makes him feel sick inside that she's not the girl he first met.  \"This cowboys running from himself\" Meaning he's confused with why she's become this way so he questions himself and that maybe he's not good enough.  \"And she's been living on the higher shelf\" He's always worshipped her and put her up on a pedestal.  \"I just wanna, I just wanna know, If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay\" He asks her for the truth, he wants to know if she really loves him.

            "answer_text": "Here is an explanation that I find someway makes sense from YouTube comments by Pham Chau A man who falls in love at first sight with a pretty girl. He becomes brave and breaks his shell. However, this girl is well-known of having bad reputations (\"my friends are turning green, you're magician assistant in their dream\"). By that he means they are aware of her tricking him by her appearance. Of course, he does not care about that. He tries his very best hoping she will return his love (such as \"quit his job\"). He loses his usual self (\"the cowboy's running from himself\") doing what she wants (\"she's been living on the highest shelf\"). He yearns for her love and wants to be assured (\"I just wanna know,... if you gotta stay). However, he realises it won't work in this way. Their hearts are not in sync (\"they come unstuck\".) She is \"destined for the screen\" hence someone who he can only appreciate her beauty and dream of it but cannot have it. But he does not give up. He tries another way. He tortures her hoping he will have her in this way (opposing the \"right-hand man\" who protects his mistress to prove his loyalty, he (the \"left-hand man\") proves his loyalty by hurting her). She starts doing what he wants yet it is because she is afraid of him. He loves her singing but she is too scared to sing it right (from the video the girl's lips sync never match the singer voice though she tries real hard. She starts to mess her make up as she is scared and threatened). He is getting irritated. He cannot hide from the truth, it is painful as he knows her too well now(\"I got a lump in my throat cause, you're gonna sing the words wrong.\"). He knows the situation is getting worse because he becomes a creep to her instead. So by knowing that he \"cannot have her any other way,\" he kills her. A pure passionate love turns into a mad obsession. ",
