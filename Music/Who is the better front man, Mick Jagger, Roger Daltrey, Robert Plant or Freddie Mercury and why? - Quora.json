            "answer_text": "They were all just as good, and good as in great! A nod to Jagger for his antics, distinctive voice, terrific lyrics, A lot of his lyrics were more sophisticated than he's been giving credit for. His voice has held up well. Puts on a show! Daltrey a little different, kind of blue collar front man. Can belt them out. Saw The Who in \u201890, I think, and he's got a powerful baritone, and I believe they were the loudest band I have heard. They were consummate professionals, and I don't think they smashed their instruments, thank God. Plant was like a rock god, all Golden Locks and chest hair and the like. He wasn't very mobile, but who cares and his stage persona was as mystical as a lot of his lyrics. Did not get to see them live. I wish I could have seen Queen around \u201877, their sound was a blend of so many different genres that it would be difficult to reproduce live. I saw them in \u201881, finally, somewhat disoriented from the Flash Gordon soundtrack. They were terrific, still. And Freddie was great, such a versatile singer, songwriter. I'm kind of indifferent about some of the props he would use, but who cares? All of these bands are in my top ten favorites ",

            "answer_text": "I would have to give it to Jagger. Plant basically stood there and sang. He was a golden god but really not that entertaining as a frontman. Jimmy Page probably moves around and entertained more on stage than Plant. Same kinda goes for Daltrey. He had now mic spinning thing but not incredibly entertaining as a frontman. He and Plant had their moments on showmanship. Freddie was definitely a great showman as well as a top shelf vocalist. Freddie is probably more famous now (since the movie) than he (or Queen) was before. Jagger wins for me because he\u2019s switched on from the moment the concert starts until it ends. He commands the audiences attention and obviously with a catalog of hits and his unique voice - he\u2019s got it all and has managed to do it now for over 50 years. ",
