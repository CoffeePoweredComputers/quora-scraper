It's very difficult to meet him for free. People spend a lot money then get a chance to meet him.. I can understand what you want to ask because I am also a belieber. Every belieber's dream is to meet him. ",

This is still risky, because he might come and meet you, but he might also have you sent out, so all the best ! ",
