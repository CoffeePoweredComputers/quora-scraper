            "answer_text": "Pop music usually has an engaging rhythm, repetitive lyrics, and an approachable musical style that is easy to sing-along. The ability to sing along is key for a lot of people who like to listen to lively music in the car while commuting and are basically killing time. Some pop music is easy to dance to as well, so you can dance and sing and be entertained in a very light-hearted fashion. Music and rhythm is ingrained into human experience. It may even be genetic. Pop music is primarily written in 4/4 time and the simplicity of that allows people to drum along easily at whatever speed best suits their dexterity without losing their place. So there\u2019s that, too. Pop music is also usually written in very familiar musical keys, so people can predict where a song will go or harmonize, even if they\u2019re hearing it for the first time. Even if it\u2019s written in a more unusual key, many if not most people appear to have an innate understanding, enough that they can sing along or merely enjoy the symmetry and simple beauty of the music. Watch me play ... the audience! BTW singing with others is a time-honored pastime that brings many, many people pleasure. Unfortunately today in the United States, apparently if you sing in public you have to be a diva or people will consider you an embarrassment at best or crazy and shun-worthy at worst. So most people interact with catchy music in their homes, vehicles, or in darkened rooms with flashing lights and the music turned up so loud that if you sing along no one will notice if you didn\u2019t hit that high C just right. Finally, pop music rarely \u2018surprises\u2019 or does anything that forces people to think, or makes them think about themes and their world in ways that relates directly to them. Cliche\u2019s in the lyrics are quite common. This is important to the audience\u2019s enjoyment of this musical form. I had a wonderful guitar instructor who told me that the songs she wrote did quite poorly until she started studying popular music. She realized that the music was full of common phrases and repeated themes. The songs were each unique, of course, and some were extremely creative, but those predictable points in the songs gave the audience a sense of home and comfort and they felt included in the music, because the music included their culture and familiar things they already loved. When you look at the big hits for popular bands, what are the titles? What are the lyrics in the choruses? They\u2019re part of pop culture. Even counter-cultural Lorde takes advantage: I\u2019m kinda over getting told to put my hands up in the air. A lot of people make fun of pop music, but its actually a difficult form. It\u2019s not easy to be simple. There\u2019s a lot of bad haiku out there, and only a few really good haiku poems. Why? Simplicity is hard. Pop songs that aren\u2019t successful quickly disappear and are easily forgotten. The great ones that take advantage of the form stick with you, sometimes even when you don\u2019t want them to. Staring at the blank page before you, open up the dirty window \u2026 How many familiar phrases and common cultural references can you pick out of Natasha Bedingfield\u2019s Unwritten? That one particularly reaches me, as an author, because the cliche\u2019 writer\u2019s block situation is the writer staring at the blank page, right? Other pop songs will have more impact on others, based on what matters to them the most, whether it\u2019s wanting to run, run so far away, wondering about how can you leave me standing alone in a world so cold, feeling like you\u2019re going to step up to the edge to see my world below, or emotionally sitting in the NASA control room singing commencing countdown engines on, check ignition and may God\u2019s love be with you \u2026. I hope this answers your question! ",

            "answer_text": "Well, the videos you linked cover a pretty broad range. For some pop music is a fun, relaxing escape. For others it\u2019s an energetic party background that can easily be ignored. The simplicity of the songs makes it easy to remember them and sing along in the car. The popularity of the stars means they have large online fandoms that can be their own hobby. And of course, the biggest base for pop music is young kids who probably aren\u2019t posting questions on Quora. I could write a whole essay about that, but basically the stars provide a venue for them to work through their feelings about growing up and finding their place in society. I seem to be into pop these days - though I certainly don\u2019t like every video you linked - but I take it kind of like watching a Disney movie as an adult. Not all of it is for me anymore, and I recognize its limitations, but there can still be some surprising or even moving moments here and there. Personally I grew up singing, so I enjoy the easy singalong bit, and I find it interesting to compare notes on vocal performances and label marketing (hey, I never said I was normal) online. I\u2019m also fascinated by the question of what makes a successful star. I used to think that people blindly liked whatever the labels and radio told them to like, but in fact something like 80% of new pop stars launched (at a price well into the seven figures) fail. It kind of feels like an analogue to the startup culture I\u2019m currently working in. ",
