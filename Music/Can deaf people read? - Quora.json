            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a bit bemused by this question and the answers so far. It is, of course, undeniable that deaf people can read. Of course they can; you don\u2019t read with your ears\u2026 or do you? Written English is a visual representation of a spoken language.* Growing up without access to spoken English, and (this is important) without access to a signed language**, written English is always going to be difficult. Anecdotally I can say that I rarely assign reading in my classes of deaf college students because they don\u2019t do it. They just don\u2019t. I\u2019ve tried and tried various ways, both carrot and stick, to get them to at least skim reading assignments, but no dice.*** Why is that? It\u2019s because written English is still an impenetrable forest of words to too many of my students. I am hearing, and I speak, understand, and write English very well. I speak ASL fairly fluently, but no deaf people would take me for a native signer, and I have to ask for repeats when I am receiving ASL. I read French probably at a 5th grade level, speak it on a survival level, and understand almost no spoken French. I grew up using English from infancy and my two other languages I learned as an adult. Reading French is likely to continue to be a chore for me because I will never have as good a grasp on it as I do on English. And this is the case for (some of) my students. They will never be able to read or write English with the ease that many hearing people do.**** This is particularly true of students who were denied access to a genuine signed language as children. So, yes, of course deaf people can read. However, many deaf people read at a lower level than many hearing people, and many struggle with it, finding it unrewarding and more difficult than it\u2019s worth. *More or less; a linguist will argue with me, but I think we can agree that, despite there being some different rules for written and spoken English, written English hews pretty closely to spoken English. **I mean a real signed language, not 40 signs that a hearing parent learned from Youtube. One with grammar and syntactical rules. ***To be clear, I\u2019m painting with a broad brush here. Of course I have deaf students who read both for classes and for pleasure. Deaf people are a large and diverse group. ****Of course, I\u2019m oversimplifying here; there are a lot of hearing native English speakers who can\u2019t write a coherent sentence, or read past an elementary school level.

            "answer_text": "Being literate in a language you cannot speak, believe it or not, is even a \u201cthing\u201d among hearing people. There are countless people all over the world whose vernacular is something else, but who can read and write English even though they cannot speak it. I have encountered many people who were literate in English but did not speak it. They had been reading it for years, but in the case of most of the people I met, lived behind the iron curtain, and never had the chance to travel, so never had a chance to speak anything but their native language and Russian (because in most Communist bloc countries, it was taught in school). A few in Czechoslovakia understood German a little from picking up television broadcasts\u2014 some German in origin, some French, UK or US, dubbed in German. I point this out, because sometimes people are incredulous that Deaf people can do anything, hearing people don\u2019t do\u2014 like learn a language they don\u2019t speak\u2014 but when you point out that occasionally hearing people do this too, [hearing] people allow that maybe Deaf people can do it. It shouldn\u2019t be this way, but it is. There are very few things that actually require hearing\u2014 maybe being a contestant on Name That Tune\u2014 but you see how far you have to reach to find something. FWIW, I\u2019m sure I couldn\u2019t be on Name That Tune either. Which was a boring show anyway. Anyway, people have been reading and writing languages they don\u2019t speak since practically the invention of writing. Hearing people, as well as Deaf people, although given the state of Deaf ed., back when even hearing ed. was pretty much something of the 1%, being literate in a language you didn\u2019t speak was almost entirely done by hearing people. Albeit, occasionally, you had an autodidact. It\u2019s not necessary to know how words sound to decode them, and no, you don\u2019t have to just memorize them. I read (although I don\u2019t write) biblical Hebrew, but I don\u2019t speak it. I can decode it just fine, even without the little vowel dots and dashes, but I don\u2019t hear it in my head\u2014 not really. I see what I\u2019m reading, it that makes sense, but pretty much, that\u2019s how I read English too. The only time I hear words in my head is when I\u2019m reading something like a Dorothy Parker \u201cConstant Reader\u201d review, but those are written to be heard, if that makes sense\u2014 you\u2019d have to read one to know what I mean. They are written as though someone is talking to you, is the best I can do. I\u2019m getting really tired of questions that are really a veiled \u201cDeaf people can\u2019t really do that, can they? I don\u2019t get it, so it must not be true.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Answering for myself, I was born deaf and I\u2019m excellent with not only reading but writing too. A lot of people have a certain stigma attached to all deaf people, they can\u2019t read. They can\u2019t drive, the list goes on and on. But, I\u2019ve never had the pleasure yet to even meet anyone completely deaf and that bothers me immensely. I tried to get my parents to send me to the school for the deaf where I\u2019d have fit in perfectly. But I was mainstreamed into the hearing world all through my school years. I got either fair to flunking certain classes because so much of the material was tested on us using the teachers voice to talk to the class. However, I thank my lucky stars that my 5th and 6th grade teacher took me under my wing while making the class do assignments while she was teaching me everything I needed to know about the English language. I went on to win spelling bees, I got straight A\u2019s in English only. All the teachers on other subjects never took such an interest in me to make sure I understood everything in his/her class, therefore, I barely passed, meaning I got lucky enough to graduate from high school. The reason I begged from time to time was because back in those days, kids teased and bullied me on a daily basis, and as a result, I always had a knot in my stomach each morning I went to school. I don\u2019t sign, never learned it because reading lips is how I learned to \u201chear\u201d. I got off topic here, but the bottom line really is it depends on the person whether they\u2019re deaf or not. Since I was excellent in my English class, and still excell in English all these days later, I am starting on a book, an autobiography on myself. As of now, before I really get started good, the title of my book is planned to be \u201c\u201cGrowing Up Deaf in a Hearing World.\u201d I am hoping to not eliminate most all stigmas on the deaf but to also educate those who want to know about them, parents who have their first and only experience with a deaf child and hopefully use what they read in my book to make the best decision in whether they need to send their child to the Scool of the Deaf. Did I say I only got straight A\u2019s in English? Imagine what difference my grades would\u2019ve been had I gone to the special school for the deaf. To answer your question on if Deaf people can read? What is the difference between deaf people that cannot read vs. hearing people who can\u2019t read? That is a thought for you to think about. Each person in our life is different, Deaf or hearing or blind. ",

Deaf people cannot hear. The majority of them are not mute. Mute people cannot use their voice. The majority of them are not deaf. Deafness and muteness are two entirely different, completely unrelated things. Deaf people who were born 100% deaf have never heard a sound, that much is true. They might not use their voice very often, but they are quite capable of making sounds come out of their mouths. Not everyone who is deaf is 100% deaf. Not everyone who is deaf was born that way. Perhaps you hear it in your head when you read, but that\u2019s only because that\u2019s how you learned it. Written words evoke mental words, but sound is not required to have words. ",

My answer: Deaf and mute people only need eyes to read. Well everyone needs eyes for reading. Mute people can still hear\u2026. And read too\u2026. So that's kinda unnecessary to ask if they can read. Deaf people can read (see below how I learnt to read) and create sounds from their mouths. Therefore we Deaf people can visualise sounds in our heads. In fact, I learnt to read by learning my native language first then match the alphabet to those letters you see in English. If you don't understand what I'm saying just before so basically, I learnt my native language then the English language then match them up to understand what I'm reading/saying. ",

She told me me that my ability to speak and write was remarkable for someone who was Deaf, and asked how I was able to develop those skills. I told her that a lot of Deaf people are good at giving presentations and good at writing. They just have crappy teachers who assume they can\u2019t read or write. It is more difficult for people who are hearing to teach Deaf people how to read and write, because they tend to adopt techniques that favor hearing people, and look upon being deaf as some sort of deficit, when it isn\u2019t.

This means that when she reads, she doesn\u2019t hear the words in her head, she just takes it in. Because of this, she is a very fast reader. Once she read an inch thick graphic novel of mine in about 15 minutes. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that it depends on your surroundings as well as your upbringing. I have not had to much problem in my reading and writing, although I am a HUGE fan of auto-correct. Why I say that is because although I do speak quite regularly and most people do not know that I am Deaf, I do say many words incorrectly. Being a published author (OK, I was 12 when a story I wrote won a young author conference award) and an avid reader, I think this helps a lot. I read four different newspapers each morning: The New York Times, the Seattle Times, Britain\u2019s Daily Telegraph, and the Irish Independent. Each puts a little different twist on the news and I feel that I get a better perspective on what is going on from these four different angles. I also read 8\u201310 books a month. I tend to read two personal growth books to one entertainment book. So, to answer your question, \u201cIs it more difficult for deaf people to read and write\u201d, my answer would be no. It all matters on how you perceive your environment. How you react to it, and if you are willing to put effort into it. I do feel that their are more stumbling blocks to leap over when you are Deaf, but if you are willing to put the work in, you will be set to go! ",
