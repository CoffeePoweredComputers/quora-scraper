            "answer_text": "Well actually it did. 2% is a quite large number for a product from such a small business unit. Where other browsers have come and gone Opera survived on a steady number for quite some time. There are a number of factors contributing to keeping Opera at this low number. MarketingIE/Edge, Firefox and Chrome are all backed by heavy budgets and all spend a lot on marketing. Their motivations for having such a budget are different from browser to browser, but they have in common that they have stakeholders that invest a lot of money in them.DistributionIE/Edge has the obvious advantage by being included in Windows. Firefox is included ad default in Linux and Unix operating systems. That may not seem as much but it\u2019s a very influential user group. Chrome in the form of Chromium are currently included in most Linux distributions however historically it hasn't had any edge over Opera in this area.Usability/SupportAll browsers has their issues that annoys users. Both Firefox and Chrome decided to ditch Scrollbars for example. But remember that Red Hat Firefox or Debian Firefox isn't identical with upstream Mozilla Firefox. Chromium also has lots of patches in open source distributions. When something doesn't work in Firefox or Chrome users has a lot of ways to get support. The community support for Opera is very small so they wound need to hire more people for that.",
