            "answer_text": "I too was going to answer this with \u201cHighly Suspect\u201d but I noticed that no one has mentioned the song that was written by Dorsey Burnette and released in 1960. Not surprising, since most who post on Quora are of a much younger generation than I. Glen Campbell did a version of it too. Lyrics are as follows: Hey little one, so far from home, and so alone Hey little one, I\u2019m just like you, I\u2019m lonely too The road of life is a long long road, when you walk alone Then I found you, I found a love, a love I\u2019ve never known Hey hey hey hey little one, don\u2019t go away, tell me you\u2019ll stay Hey hey hey hey little one, I\u2019m just like you, I\u2019m so lonely too ",
