            "answer_text": "They should, instead, compensate the parties they have damaged for the amount determined by the jury as proper damages. Additionally, the law for copyright in the United States allows statutory damages, which can get quite high for willful infringement. The law does not allow punitive damages (i.e. \"punishment\"). Be aware that judges can (and do!) take outrageous jury awards for statutory damages and reduces them. In both of the two \"crazy\" cases against personal use downloading (Sony BMG Music Entertainment v. Tenenbaum and Capitol Records, Inc. v. Thomas-Rasset) different judges reduced the statutory damages to 3x the minimum value, greating shrinking the $675,000 and $1.92 million these defendants were looking at. Juries tend to follow the rules they are given by verbatim, which is why they also have a \"check-and-balance\" in our legal system.  Actual damages arising from copyright infringement are often hard to calculate or prove. That's why Congress created statutory damages and why so many copyright owners rely on them. \"People hardly ever bring copyright actions based on actual damages because those damages are so difficult to prove and are often very low,\" Post says. -- Copyright Owners Upset Over Two Recent Court Rulings that Cap Statutory Damages If damages, both actual and statutory are too low, plaintiffs just plain won't be able to go after copyright infringers. The only ones that will be able to protect their Constitutional rights to copyright are those that can afford to throw money away on the effort. That's not really fair to those that have a legitimate tort claim against an infringer and have a moral right, protected by law, to have the sole say in distribution of their work. Remember, copyright is not solely an \"economic right\". There is a moral right granted to be the one that has final say on distribution or copying. That's why statutory damages exist to act as a disincentive to violating the rights of copyright holders. But this isn't a \"punishment\", in the legal sense. If you think that copyright is solely about the big guy picking on the small guy, let me assure you that this is not the case. Individual artists file for copyright infringement all of the time and need the return of statutory damages to be able to make the lawsuit possible in the first place.NYTimes Photographer Sues Perez Hilton for $2.1M Over Copyright Infringement.Photographer sues Nike over Michael Jordan photo copyrightBuzzfeed sued by photographer for $3.6m over 'copyright breach' ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is, \u2018no\u2019. The longer answer is more complicated and ensconced in the word \u2014 \u2018intent\u2019. If your intent is to download material you know to be meant for a singular audience and to then redistribute it, then you are morally in the wrong. Furthermore, if your intent is to download copyrighted material, replicate it and then redistribute it for PROFIT, you are crossing explicit legal lines. The implicit moral concerns are stamped on the deed on itself \u2014 \u2018you are selling stolen goods\u2019. Conversely, if your intent is to download copyrighted digital material that is otherwise available to the public for you personal consumption then the lines take on a more grayish tone. It is, by all definitions ILLEGAL to engage in this practice. However, very few entities will actually pursue single use downloaders. It\u2019s not cost effective. There have been cases in the past where with content holders have attempted to make \u2018examples\u2019 out of people who were caught with downloaded music on their hard drives. However, most if not all of these cases were either dropped or settled out of court with not more than a warning of \u2018not-to-do-again\u2019. I\u2019ve been downloading music, movies etc since the late 80s. I do however, have developed a personal ethical code \u2014 if there is such a thing in this case. For example, I never download music from a band who is signed to an \u2018independent\u2019 label. I will instead choose to stream them. I won\u2019t save their music to my hard drives until I pay for it. However, the artist(s) are signed to major labels then I will save it. Most importantly are FILMS. I have ONE rule and ONE rule only.. I will never stream or download any visual media that has not been released for retail. This has been a rule of mine since the earliest days of Bittorrent. I have never broken this self imposed rule, even though I have been tempted. As you can see, it really comes down to one\u2019s personal ethics and understanding of how the economy of the entertainment industry works. ",
