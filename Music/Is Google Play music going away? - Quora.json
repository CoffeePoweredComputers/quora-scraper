            "answer_text": "I WANT to say \u2018because they're mean', but I like Google (except for them taking away my Google Play Music!!) &That's not the reason they've ripped Google Play Music from our lives (even though it feels very true)Google Play Music was free to use. You could download any song, from any source, & play it via the app. You could also upload songs to your phone (such as songs from CDs copied to your computer, then moved to your phone). The only time Google made any money off the app's usage when when people purchased songs/albums through the Play Store. YouTube music, on the other hand, has ENOUGH ADS TO SINK A BATTLESHIP before, after, & sometimes IN THE MIDDLE of songs. And the only way you can stop that horrid ad spamming & just enjoy your music is if you pay Google to stop them - via a subscription to YouTube Music Premium. Google claims you can transfer your music library from Play Music to YouTube Music\u2026but, it'll have ads. GALORE. They're literally trying to frustrate people into being so sick of their nonstop ads that we PAY THEM to stop it & let us listen to the songs that we paid them for via the Play Store. It definitely feels like a mob movie protection style racket - you pay us to NOT assault you incessantly with ads & MAYBE we'll let you enjoy the music that you've already purchased\u2026Maybe. No guarantees\u2026don't hold your breathe (evil mob boss snickering devolves quickly into outright full body gleeful laughter) Unlike Play Music, YouTube Music is a streaming service - so it EATS data. Voraciously. It also requires an internet connection to use it - a consistent, non-wonky internet connection. Unfortunately, many tech companies have discovered they can make a helluva lot more money by spamming us with ads & by forcing us to pay for expensive subscriptions to use programs that we used to be able to buy for a one time cost (ex. Microsoft Office Suite vs Office 360; Adobe) or were free (Google Play Music vs YouTube Music). It's \u2018how can we squeeze more money out of people without having to add anything of value or do any additional work\u2019, imho. I loathe this trend, in case you can't tell. Unlike the previously purchasable programs/free apps, their online/streaming subscription are RARELY designed to work with assistive tech - it's an after thought, patched in to partially work (if it ever works at all), at most. Reliable, steady internet service is something only the rich & people in certain areas have access to. Music video streaming on YouTube will cause overages on a cell phone's data plan (& the resultant EXORBITANT data overage costs) in a hot minute. And monthly subscription costs? Amazon, Netflix, Disney+, CBSAllAccess(?), Funimation, & the sea of other media subscriptions, not to mention basic word processing programs like Microsoft's online only, monthly subscription required, Word \u2018360\u2019- those all add up fast, if you can even afford any of them in the first place! & with COVID & the jobless rate right now, this move by Google feels particularly cruel. I truly wish Google would reconsider this action. But, alas, we're living in the worst timeline, where Google has chosen to pin their hopes on increased ad revenue & YouTube Music subscriber figures increasing, at the expense of users (& lost goodwill of consumers). Google choosing to contribute to the ever increasing gap between the rich, who can afford & have internet access as well as the disposable income to spend hundreds per month on media subscriptions & data overages, & all us poor people, does not bode well for anyone's future. Seriously Google\u2026. Can you just not? \ud83d\ude4f ",

            "answer_text": "For some time, Google has been giving attention to another app instead \u2014 YouTube Music. Until recently, Google has supported both the apps; Play Music and YouTube Music were both operational at once. Both the services use the same subscription as well; Play Music, YouTube Music, and YouTube Premium are all using the same subscription. Unfortunately, Google has decided to shift their focus entirely to YouTube Music, and is shutting down Play Music as a result. This is likely so that they can focus their efforts on the one app rather than on both. You can still sign into YouTube Music with the same account, and transfer your playlists there. ",
