            "answer_text": "The answer is not entirely cut and dry. Abbey Road (1969) was the last album the Beatles sat down and recorded from start to finish. But Let it Be (1970) was the last album they released. Most Let it Be tracks were recorded before the Abbey Road sessions. However, some Let it Be tracks were recorded after Abbey Road\u2019s release. I Me Mine, one of George Harrison\u2019s tracks on Let it Be, was the last Beatles song recorded (minus John Lennon, who does not appear on the song) and was the only song the Beatles recorded fully in the 1970s (recorded 3 January 1970). Also a few tracks off Let it Be, including the title track, The Long and Winding Road and Across the Universe, were partially recorded both before Abbey Road and after its release in August 1969. So, Abbey Road was the last album the Beatles sat down as a group and recorded together, but this was bookended by Let it Be sessions. ",

            "answer_text": "There are three answers to this question. Last year Apple released the Beatles\u2019 expanded White Album which included the Escher Demos. This was the last official release if you include compilations, live and outtake albums.The last studio album to be released was Let It Be back in 1970 after McCartney announced they broke up.The last studio album recorded by the Beatles to be released was Abbey Road. Let It Be primarily was recorded before Abbey Road, it was released after. The Beatles (minus Lennon) did record I Me Mine and put some finishing touches on Let It Be the song for Let It Be the album after Abbey Road though.",
