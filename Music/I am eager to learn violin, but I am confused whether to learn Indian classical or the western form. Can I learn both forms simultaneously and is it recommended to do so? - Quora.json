            "answer_text": "You can learn both but it's not recommended to do so simultaneously. They are different styles with different techniques. To become proficient in any one form (true for any musical instrument) needs time, dedicated practice and patience. It is better to focus on one at at time, gain a reasonable amount of expertise in it and then pick up the next one.  Since you don't have any previous knowledge of music your learning curve will differ from somebody who does, and hence focus is all the more important. ",
