            "answer_text": "Some people might tell you not to, some people might tell you to. Just sing whatever you feel most comfortable with, but never sing a song they are not going to be able to understand or judge your pronunciation, so sing preferably in English or Korean, whichever suits you best. And NEVER sing a song from a group under the label you are auditioning for.For example, if you are auditioning for Cube, don\u2019t sing or dance a Pentagon or a (G)I-DLE song. They want people with talent and charisma, not people who are trying to get in for their idols. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve heard from people who\u2019ve auditioned and got in that you can, but try not to use a very mainstream song. That can make you seem like just an obsessed fan of the company/artist, and will greatly lower your chances. Also, make sure it complements your voice, obviously :) ",

Just make sure you pronounce the lyrics correctly and here\u2019s a piece of advice: if you\u2019re auditioning to a company (let\u2019s say YG, for example), and you sing a K-pop song released by an artist under YG, make sure you know all the lyrics by heart and you have correct punctuation. If not, you\u2019re going to get compared. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think it would be bad however make sure to use a song that compliments your voice and that you can perform very well. For example: Let\u2019s say you choose a song with many high notes but you haven\u2019t trained your voice for high notes, and then you audition and it all goes wrong\u2026get me? Good luck! :) ",
