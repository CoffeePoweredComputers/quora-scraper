            "answer_text": "A2A: well, if you want to specifically make some house you might want to start with knowing how whatever variant of house you want to make works... by that I don't mean how it sounds, no, I mean how it works, how it is made, what makes house... well, house.So... you might want to start by listening house... listening as in the way a producer or musician would listen and not your generic everyday guy/gall. Then you might want to use some DAW to try to emulate your favourites... With time you should get an understanding how it works. Tutorials, of course, also help. Well... that basically sums it up. One thing, however: you might want to refrain from forcing a specific kind of music. If you notice that your music wants to go in a different direction then don't force it to go in a specific direction but let yourself be carryed by your music instead... Is more fun and normally yields better results as well. ",
