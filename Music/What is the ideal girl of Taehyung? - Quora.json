            "answer_text": "Well, I\u2019ve read and heard a bunch of things so there\u2019s not entirely an ultimately clear answer to TaeTae\u2019s ideal girl. But here are some of the things he\u2019s mentioned as well as the members: *He stated that he likes a girl that is charismatic and is a little bit stingy, he likes a girl that is thrifty and can spend his money well without going crazy and buying what is only needed and affordable. As well as showing him a thing or two if he spends his own money unwisely. *He also stated that he\u2019d like a girl that\u2019d take care of him and is a thoughtful person since he doesn\u2019t do much thinking (hahhaha this boy! Seriously!). *Also style wise, he\u2019d like a girl that is very laid back in clothing, like ripped jeans and a baggy t-shirt, something that resembles his own style. *I personally think that V\u2019s very family oriented so that\u2019s why another characteristic he\u2019d like in a girl would be that she is also that way, that she will give everything to her parents and to his parents as much as she can. But, OVERALL, since V is just a ball of quirkiness and young, his ideal girl type changes ALL the time as RM mentioned before in an interview, he never truly has one staple, it changes with the seasons and that is SO fitting for his personality. Or at least what we think we know about his personality. He\u2019s not my bias! But I love this boy!! <3 ",
