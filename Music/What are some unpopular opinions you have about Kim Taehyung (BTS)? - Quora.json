            "answer_text": "Edit: so I added a WHOLE LOT since last night. If you read this previously, you may notice that there are a lot of extra points now. Reread if you would like to see more opinions of my good man Tae Tae :) \u2014\u2014 I\u2019ve been painfully biased (and a bit defensive) towards Taehyung since the moment I first laid eyes on him, so I\u2019ve always paid special attention to him particularly. A few things I\u2019ve noticed: I mentioned this once in a previous answer, but I don\u2019t think he really wanted the limelight. Earlier on, he mentioned that he wanted to either be an actor or play the saxophone, but I think those were just childhood dreams, the way I dreamt of being a paleontologist or a fairy princess. I don\u2019t think he actually expected to become famous and he seems horribly under prepared for it. I feel as though the others were all going into entertainment because they wanted to be famous but it just sort of happened for Tae. He was a farmer. Not a dancer. Not a singer. Not a model. A FARMER. He was fully prepared to grow strawberries on his family\u2019s farm and now he\u2019s an international heart throb and I feel he\u2019s\u2026 not necessarily resentful or regretful, but not happy. He just seems so confused and aloof about this situation, and honestly maybe a bit scared. He doesn\u2019t seem like he LOVES it but tolerates it at the very least.I feel like he\u2019s a very private guy and tries to keep as much as possible about him unknown. Honestly it was that mystery about him that attracted me in the first place. But aside from hobbies, he doesn\u2019t like to talk much about himself. I\u2019ve probably seen 95 years worth of BTS content and I still have no idea who his siblings are. The others have all taken pics with their siblings who\u2019ve shown their appreciation with their famous brothers but not Tae\u2019s. There\u2019s hardly any pics of his parents even.I feel like there\u2019s bad blood between him and his brother. Going back to the last point, there\u2019s not a whole lot about Tae\u2019s family, but he seems super guilty and sad whenever he does mention his brother. His sister, to a degree, but it seems more like she\u2019s going through her \u201cugh my big brother is so lame\u201d kinda phase (leading me to think she\u2019s in her early to mid teens), especially since she refuses to call him oppa like he mentioned once. But I feel like he purposefully avoids talking about his brother specifically. Obviously I don\u2019t know them or know their lives, but two of my own brothers don\u2019t talk anymore and I can see what kind of damage it does to a family. My eldest brother will never say it but it really really bothers him, especially in the beginning, that his little brother that he grew up with avoids him like the plague. (My brother is also a Capricorn like Tae and Caps are family men, if that means anything).I feel like Stigma was about Tae\u2019s siblings. Obviously because of the lines \u201cI\u2019m sorry my brother\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m sorry my sister\u201d, but also because he seems GUILTY when he talks about them. Like his fame is a STIGMA to them. Realistically, I could imagine his siblings getting harassed at school for it and growing resentment towards him, but I feel like it\u2019s deeper then that. Not my place to explore any further. I just hope everything turns out ok.Tae was just as under appreciated as Jin in the beginning but once Big Hit saw that fans loved him, they started to milk it. From what I understand, Jin and Tae were both brought on as visuals, ie to stand there and look pretty. As unfair as that sounds, that\u2019s sort of why I assumed they didn\u2019t have too many lines at the beginning. Heck, up until their explosion in popularity, Tae basically would just repeat a chorus or growl occasionally. Rarely did he sing and a solo seemed unheard of. It wasn\u2019t until after he became everyone\u2019s \u201cfavorite\u201d that they started to let him sing and have more of a stage presence. Even still, he has 3 solos. Namjoon has two mixtapes and like 95 other songs, JK makes a cover every other minute and basically sang the first two albums alone with Jimin. The rap line always has and always will get the bulk of the lines. Maybe I\u2019m just defensive, and I\u2019m sure Jin still has much less music then Tae out, but I think they still don\u2019t appreciate him as much as they should. I mean, his boss didn\u2019t know his name for a fucking year. I doubt that dynamic changed very much in that time. Just look at Truth Untold and it\u2019s line distribution. (Note: by they, I don\u2019t mean BTS, I mean the management. I doubt they would intentionally do that to Tae. I\u2019m pretty sure, especially in the beginning, it was out of their hands, hence why things are a little better now.)Taehyung is incredibly creative and artistic and I love/hate his works. I have my BA in art and it\u2019s odd seeing a celebrity openly talk about things I actually studied in school. It\u2019s weird how we have so many hobbies in common but I digress. Personally, not a huge fan of his work, but it\u2019s so important for him to have an outlet to express himself creatively. I know he\u2019s frustrated and all that frustration is much better on a canvas then in him. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s pursuing art and things he loves to get him going. I did not like his paintings, I\u2019m not gonna lie. I didn\u2019t get them and thought they made no sense. But the beauty of art is that it doesn\u2019t have to. As long as it made sense to him and made him feel good, that\u2019s all I need to know.Mentally, I think he\u2019s checked out. Call it maturity, growing up, becoming jaded, having traumatic things happen, it all points to the same thing: he\u2019s not the same kid he debuted as. Yes he\u2019s older, yes he lost a lot of important people, yes he has to watch his tongue because he\u2019s in the limelight now. But I think more then anything, he\u2019s TIRED. He's sick of a million critics telling him he doesn\u2019t know how to do x y or z while hiding behind a computer screen and not knowing the first damn thing about him or his life. Someone mentioned it before, but I\u2019m pretty sure the reason he broke down when Jin mentioned they almost disbanded was because he was the one that suggested disbanding. I know he loves his friends and loves making music but I\u2019m pretty sure he would give anything to go home and have those few years he missed with his family.He really needs to talk more. Nine times out of 10, every interview, English, Korean or otherwise, is just Namjoon talking to the interviewer. And this kind of goes for the rest of them but for the most part a lot of them try to add at least some commentary. As for Tae, I feel like he just tries to hide in the background a lot. And it could go back to him being tired or him not wanting to say something that will be immortalized for the wrong reasons. But I know Tae has a lot of intelligent things to say that would really be interesting to hear about and instead he just keeps quiet because people tease him all the time. Really fucking sucks. I think he recently mentioned that he doesn\u2019t do Vlives anymore because he doesn\u2019t know how to make Army happy. To me, it sounds like he\u2019s done trying to please people who don\u2019t want to be pleased. Can\u2019t blame the guy. I love hearing him talk and adore his little anecdotes, but I hope he doesn\u2019t do another live until his fans mature. For his own sake and the sake of his sanity.He would look so fucking sexy with facial hair. Everytime I see his stubble, a part of me bursts into flames.His mullet was really sexy. That\u2019s a sentence I never thought I would see written but Taehyung made the literal worst hairstyle possible look amazing.I know it\u2019s super exciting to see where BTS was and where they are now. We are all very, very proud. And a lot of people will probably get mad at me for saying this, but I wish BTS didn\u2019t hit this level of fame. It\u2019s a LOT of pressure. Like, unreal levels of pressure are on these boys\u2019 shoulders. The whole world is looking at them, waiting to see what they do next, waiting to hear their new song, waiting to be moved by their lyrics, waiting to sell out their concerts, waiting for them to fuck up, waiting for a scandal, waiting for the decline from stardom, waiting for them to win a Grammy, waiting for their comic or movie or skit or variety show or whatever projects they\u2019re working on these days, waiting for them to go into the military, waiting for them to do literally anything. Imagine the whole world with their eyes on you. It\u2019s probably terrifying. Not to say they don\u2019t enjoy their fame or love their success but there\u2019s bad with the good and good with the bad. They get stalked, cursed, followed, have cameras on them all day. Yeah, they have fame and people love them but people hate them too. I\u2019ll stop here before I get cruscified but long story short, I wish they had a smaller, loyal fan base that loved them instead of people following them to the airport without wearing any pants.If he goes solo, it shouldn\u2019t be for music. I feel like he would be a lot happier being an actor or doing freelance artwork. He\u2019s very good at music but I don\u2019t feel like that\u2019s where his passion is. I think Tae would do much better as an actor, a fashion designer, photographer, or something where he didn\u2019t have such strict schedules to follow. I hope whatever he decides to do, people support him and he\u2019s happy doing it.I feel like he\u2019s very self critical and has low self esteem and depression. Yes, he\u2019s the hottest man on this planet and has boundless talents but he\u2019s also got a lot of pressure to live up to that face, as Gay Rossi-Espagnet mentioned in the comments. He has to be that face and always be that beautiful and that talented and that amazing. He actually broke down crying at a concert once because he was sick and couldn\u2019t meet the standard he set for himself because of a sore throat. People could be sympathetic and understanding towards him, but Tae will always be his own harshest critic. It\u2019s like that\u2019s with all of us.In the beginning, he had a thick accent/different dialect and they made fun of him a lot and it really fucked with his confidence. I\u2019m sure that contributed to him closing off from people. Even in interviews and broadcasts, they cracked the fuck up every time he spoke. But he would get embarrassed and get really quiet and not interact with them much after that. Examples would be basically this whole video of him saying things and getting laughed at. And trying not to look hurt. From experience, I know exactly how that feels. I\u2019m bilingual, but English is my native language. I also speak Arabic. But my Arabic dialect is only spoken in a small area of Palestine and when I speak to others not from there in Arabic they usually tease me. I\u2019ve gotten teased to the point where I tell people I don\u2019t speak Arabic so I don\u2019t have to get teased anymore. But at least I have my English to fall back on. Korean is his native language and that dialect is how he speaks. It must have been hell to adjust to that and basically relearn his whole language just so people would leave him alone.  Edit: So I learned that apparently Tae was seen at the airport holding a book about learning how to hone his speaking skills called \u201cThe Power Of Words\u201d (\ub9d0\uc758 \ub0b4\uacf5 in Korean). Idk about you but sounds like confirmation that he\u2019s self-conscious about how he speaks and wants to work on it. I\u2019m so glad he took it as an opportunity to better himself instead of being defeated by it. It certainly seems like something that\u2019s been eating at him for a while.  Idk why I feel super defensive over Tae despite not knowing the guy but I hope he\u2019s safe and well and putting himself first. He owes that much to himself after all he\u2019s been through. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh boy! Where do I start. I really want to write this because this man has really earned my respect recently. He was never my bias in bts (he's real close to wrecking that list though), but he's the one that's made the deepest impression on me.   Some recent pictures of tae tae to bless your souls. You are welcome. Now on to unpopular opinions - He's self relient and self assured and independent - yes he's a pure soul. Yes, he has a child like outlook on life. But he's also extremely intuitive, wise and a creative genius. He doesn't care about what other people think either. This is why he mostly does not bother to put on a facade when he is annoyed or bored. He just behaves enough to be polite. He never pretends to be someone he's not. And he wears female accessories and women's night gowns if he feels like it. And rocks them too, might I add. That's as secure as a man can get. He also does not let anyone bully him into doing things he does not want to, like going to the gym. Respect tae tae\u270aRespect.He's an old soul with a complex personality - you shouldn't think that you have figured him out after watching a couple of bb or run episodes. He's deeper than most people can fathom.He's got great strength of character -he's endured tragedy after tragedy while touring and managed to fool the cameras for years to an end. And he's the only one in bts who's ever stood upto the toxic fans, repeatedly. I also believe that there are complications in his personal life and that he has undergone more hardships than he let's on. He's also been dealing with CU for all these years while touring like crazy.The man deserves credits. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4fHe's sensitive yet somehow cold too- yes, he's strong and doesn't take any bull s*it. But he's also a sensitive and pure soul. But I noticed that he can be quite cold to people sometimes. He tends to shrug people off at times. Most likely for a good reason.He's the most candid bts member - he of course hides the private parts of his life,(as he should), but he tries his best to be as candid as possible with his fans. And he's unapologetically himself.He was born extremely blessed - he is not only good at every thing he tries to do, he also adds his own unique touch to it makes it special. He's also talented in singing, dancing, performing and was blessed with inhumanly gorgeous looks. God really blessed him with his both his hands. And for good reason, mind you. His heart is gold. And he deserves every single title he has recieved for his looks. The man is ethereal. You can fight me on this one.He's kind hearted and selfless to a fault - it's just simply who he is. He does not do it because of the cameras or because that's his persona. It's simply who he is. He would always rather he be hurt than others.He's stubborn - he has strong opinions and will not budge easily.He holds no vanity because of his looks or fame - he never tries to exploit a situation for his own personal gain or think he's better than others because of his ethereal looks or popularity, he doesn't care about those things.He has this energy that draws people in - it must be the innane purity within him I guess. But he could literally just be sitting there you would still be curious about him. He's also equally comfortable with celebrities, non - celebrities, men, women, children or pretty much anyone. He would probably befriend an alien too (now that fanfiction I would be open to reading\ud83d\ude02). He draws in both men and women because of this.There's some beef between him and big hit - I'm not saying they hate him or anything. But there's clearly some discord there. It's most likely due to him being a wild card and not being easy to control. I think it's a similar situation with jin. Also, I don't know what the complication about his relationship with jk is but tae really paid a high price for it. Taekookers are not completely off base when they say that the big hit tried to downplay their relationship(most likely still does). But the way they tried to do it seems to have been to simply cut taehyung out of any and all scenes when he had any proximity to jk. And since jk was in most scenes, taehyung was pretty much invisible during 2017. Add that to the fact that he was \u2018accidentally\u2019 missed out on most of their promotions etc, his popularity did not increase as much as it should have in 2018. I believe other people on this thread have already elaborated more on this, so I won't get into it. (2019 is another fiasco I'm not gonna go near)Taehyung will be perfectly fine when bts disband - he's the only member with a solid life outside of bts. He has various interests too. And with that face and voice and talent in modelling and acting, he'll be a hit no matter what he does. And even if retires from the kpop industry, he'll be perfectly happy. He doesn't seem like he needs fame to keep him happy.He does not like jimin's on screen persona - yes, he loves jimin. Very much so. But the jimin he truly loves is the jimin when the cameras are off. He does not seem to be a fan of jimin's flamboyant over flirtatious on screen persona.Taehyung prefers the hyung line to the makne line now - I don't know whether it's because of jimin's over flirtatious behavior or whatever complication is there between him and jk but taehyung seem to like to keep away from them on camera. A good decision if you ask me, he can do without that drama. [Also, can we for the love of God please have more screen time for taehyung and the hyung line?? I'm not paying to see weird jikook fan service added in with some dumb captions that seems like it's out of a shipping vedio\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. What happened to being authentic and being OT7??\ud83d\ude11]He's sacrificed a lot for BTS- he preaches OT7 the most even after all that discord with big hit. He must clearly have gotten more offers for acting (hwarang was offered to him by its director personally i believe) but he doesn't pursue it so that he can focus on bts. I heard somewhere that big hit turned down individual modeling contractors too (not too sure about this one though).He stands up for himself and doesn't tolerate hypocrisy - this right here is the reason he will most likely bias wreck me soon. He legit seems done with kpop world's hypocrisy. He doesn't even bother to try and not look bored in award shows and American interviews anymore. He also does not do much fan service anymore either. (I believe this is why people keep asking why taehyung is not as close to jimin and jungkook as compared to before(and jikook is popular now by extension). Just because he doesn't do fan service like the two of them does not mean they are not friends any more people. It just simply means that taehyung put his foot down and refused to pretend to be gay to appease delusional fan girls) . Respect\u270aAlso, People who think he is loved only for his looks needs to get whacked because people love him for who he is, not because of his face or anything materialistic like that. And to think some clown in this thread had the audacity to call him an attention seeker\ud83d\ude44. Imma sharingam your ass if i ever meet you girl. (People who don't know what a sharingam is welcome to Google it)And all you losers who unstanned him because there might be a possibility of him vaping can go to hell. And take your stupidity with you. So can all you delusional jikookers who hates on him over your insecurities over a non existent relationship. If it wasn't for taehyung, jk would not be the person he is today. He's the one who got him out of his shell and to even take off his clothes in front of other bts members and to sing a whole song without bursting into tears. And if it wasn't for taehyung, jimin wouldn't even be in bts. So, you all need to grow some brain cells. Ship whoever you want but don't turn into a human with the brains of a single cell organism over it.Also, all you clowns in this thread saying he is not dance line material or not good looking needs to go get yourself checked. Or accept that you are biased and jealous. I would like to say I respect all opinions but sorry no, I see no reason to respect stupidity. Get yourself checked. Period.And can the rest of you please stop victimizing him. He's perfectly fine. He was struggling with a lot of personal things before, but not anymore. He doesn't need pity, just respect and support him. He can take care of himself. And yeah, if any of you tae-haters have a problem with these opinions, Come at me bro, I believe in helping brain dead people out. \ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2640\ufe0fPeace out\u270c\ufe0f",
