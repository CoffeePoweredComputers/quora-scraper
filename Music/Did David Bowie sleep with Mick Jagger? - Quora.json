            "answer_text": "Angie Bowie is the only person that\u2019s put this forward, implying that the pair were having a homoerotic affair as she has said they were in bed and naked, but emphasized she saw nothing sexual going on as if she\u2019s retreating from the gaping chasm of innuendo she just kick-started. Nobody else has come forward with any other similar allegations or confirmed what Angie says she saw. So, her whole story remains in the realm of suspect volition, salacious gossip, unsubstantiated rumour and urban legend. There are people who want to believe it happened and others who think the whole thing preposterous, and yet others, preposterous as it is to them, certainly possible, as anything would be possible in this life that passes like a surreal dream, and yet even more others who don\u2019t really care, couldn\u2019t give a fig. I\u2019m in the couldn\u2019t give a fig category. I see the story as just some sensationalist crap that fed into the image mill and reputations of both men. It went something like this, that Bowie being openly bisexual with a voracious sexual appetite that matched his coke consumption coulda and woulda and Jagger being equally the same, except primarily hetero, monkey manning around with fashion models and yet bisexually curious enough to cross the divide, also coulda and woulda. The reality was probably a lot more prosaic, normal and boring, that Mick Jagger and David Bowie were just good friends, they liked each other. They would sometimes hang out, be seen together in public but sex between them likely didn\u2019t enter into the relationship. Bowie, for all his rep as a bisexual, was known by those who knew him best as being primarily hetero in his tastes with a fondness for black females. It\u2019s the people that observe celebrities seen together as putting two and two together, \u2018\u2019oh, they must be having an affair.\u2019\u2019 And then the hearsay and the rumours start. ",

            "answer_text": "Why would you think that? I know there is speculation that they were found asleep together but Jagger has always maintained he is hetero and his string of girlfriends would seems to indicate this . Bowie experimented a lot in his youth and proclaimed he was bi sexual but everything would indicate he was more hetero than anything but with an eye for the exotic ! I think the bi publicity was true but announced for shock value at the time. He did lots of things at the time to get fame . No, I do not think they were in love . They were friends and rivals , that\u2019s all ",

It\u2019s never been confirmed by anyone, and the nearest I\u2019ve heard to a sensible answer is that they were both drunk and/or high and crashed in the same bed. Bowie certainly slept with guys in the 60s and 70s, even if he did rather over sell the bisexuality image for sensationalism. I\u2019ve never heard another rumour about Mick being bisexual. I would think it possible but unlikely. ",
