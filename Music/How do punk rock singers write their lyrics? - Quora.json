            "answer_text": "Well, I cannot say that I have actually seen this being done, but I have witnessed similar processes by other unconventional people. If the actual lyrics are not recited from memory (quite a common method), then I would say 99% of the time it is with ball point pen because of it's ubiquitous nature. Pencils require sharpening, crayons are mostly owned by kids too young to like punk rock much anyway, and indelible markers cost money. As for the actual writing surface, well the first drafts could be on just about anything but eventually they will be written onto paper. I really don't think any punk warbler has ever used a word processor or typewriter for their first drafts, but its a big world out there and times do change. ",
