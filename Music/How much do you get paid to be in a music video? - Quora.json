Now they are thinking twice about having been exploited, and are threatening to take legal action. Something to keep in mind, an instructive tale, even if a \u201cfish tale/tail.\u201d I guess you could say they were baited.  JA - No legal advice is intended. ",

I worked NY 90's background videos that were $400 for the day And a Jennifer Lopez Video in the background for about $200 I am a Union member,so things have happily changed a bit in that area for the better. If it's passion-do it If it's pleasure-do it If you are needing the rent-ask what they pay or look at a casting notice. Dancers,features roles are going to get more fyi. Have fun. ",
