            "answer_text": "From Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey In 1935, American commentator Walter Winchell coined the term \"disc jockey\" (the combination of disc, referring to the disc records, and jockey, which is an operator of a machine) as a description of radio announcer Martin Block, the first announcer to become a star. While his audience was awaiting developments in the Lindbergh kidnapping, Block played records and created the illusion that he was broadcasting from a ballroom, with the nation\u2019s top dance bands performing live. The show, which he called Make Believe Ballroom, was an instant hit. The term \"disc jockey\" appeared in print in Variety in 1941.[5] ",
