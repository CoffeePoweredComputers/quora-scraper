            "answer_text": "The lyrics have already been listed in another answer. The only figurative language I recognize in it is that McCartney is not necessarily talking about \u201cMother Mary\u201d in the religious sense of the mother of Jesus. His own mother was named Mary (who died when he was young), so it carries a double meaning for him. I think that is typical Beatles doublespeak. The rest of the lyrics are straightforward, referring to conflict and resolution personally and in the world in general. ",
