            "answer_text": "I used to like pretty much every BLACKPINK song. But after a while, it got boring. KTL was a complete let down and I think that was just a downwards spiral for me from then on. I dislike BLACKPINK in general nowadays because I feel like they\u2019re no longer Kpop idols. And looking back on the songs I did like, I think to myself how generic they all sound. They literally sound like any other pop song and they all have the same aura, the same choreography\u2019s and everything. I don\u2019t hate BLACKPINK, they are ultimately more successful than I\u2019ll ever be and I have nothing but respect for them. However in my opinion, I\u2019m confused to why they still have a fan base. Aren\u2019t blinks bored? It\u2019s nearly been a year since they released their last album like it has been for the past 3 years (Though should it really be classed as an album if there\u2019s only 5 songs?). You guys are literally getting 1 comeback a year. I feel bad lmao. ",
