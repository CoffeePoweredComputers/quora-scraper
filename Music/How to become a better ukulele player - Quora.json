            "answer_text": "I like Ryan O\u2019Rourke\u2019s answer a lot if you are a beginner, striving to become an intermediate level player. To that list I would add three additional steps: 3.1. Find a handful of songs (from those books and internet sources) that you enjoy listening to, and would love to be able to play and sing. 4.1 Join a ukulele club in your area, if one is available. These usually meet every 2 weeks or every month, and are open, friendly groups of people at all levels who want to improve their playing technique or simply love to play the instrument in a group setting. Some uke clubs are small, 4\u201310 people, and some are huge, over 100. 4.2. Get up the nerve to play in public. Go to an open mic night somewhere in your area, or take advantage of an open mic opportunity during the monthly uke club meeting, if there is one. Find a few friends that play the kind of music you enjoy and form a small band and then volunteer to play somewhere, anywhere. As you continue to improve, the range of ways you can become an ever better player grow - You can grow from strumming chords to picking out notes from those chord patterns to playing licks rooted in the chords to playing melody along with the chords to embellishing on the melody over the chords.You can become comfortable with playing up the neck, not just in first position (C, F, Am, G/G7, etc.). Use all 4 fingers and see how this expands your range. And never again fear playing E or B.As you become a good intermediate player and seek to improve to advanced player - You can learn to shift between supporting the song and playing lead. This becomes important as you play more with others in small groups.You can learn more about music theory, the history of music, different types of music, etc. A strong music theory understanding will help you play different styles, shift key signatures, understand moods based on tone and speed shifts, and so much more.You can teach a new student. There is nothing like teaching to open up new insights about learning and improving yourself.You can write songs. When you understand the tonal capabilities of the instrument, you can stretch yourself to use more of those abilities.You can improvise as you perform. I think one of the greatest abilities of a performer is to be able to improvise under the main framework of the song and truly make it your own.And all of the time, at any level, the secret is to stay in love with the instrument and the sound you are making with it. Uke on! ",

            "answer_text": "To really improve, you need to know what you want to do with your playing ability. What is your goal? Do you want to just have fun with it? Preform? Become the next Jake Shimabukuro or Taimane Gardener? Having a set goal in mind is ESSENTIAL. Whatever your goal is it will take dedication to reach it. And practice. LOTS of practice. If you are a beginner, practice only a little bit every day. Get used to a uke being in your hands, build up callouses (once you have them playing is much easier). Slowly, start playing more every day. If you are a more experienced uke player, try and tackle something that you\u2019ve never done before. Go big, but doable. Bodysurfing by Honoka and Azita is a really challenging, but really pays off once you\u2019ve learned it. Never played triplets before? Give it a go. Wanna spice up your playing? Learn how to do the rasgueado technique or flamenco style. As far as learning material goes, some people do just fine with YouTube videos and Uku Tabs (Link here: Ukulele Chords and Tabs \u2022 UkuTabs). Other people prefer taking lessons. Find what suits you. Eventually, you will build up your song repertoire and feel very comfortable playing. While that is good and a great achievement, DON\u2019T get too comfortable. That is something that many musicians fall prey to. They stick with the stuff they know and never push themselves. Once you have nailed a particular technique or song. Try something new. Push yourself. You won\u2019t know what\u2019s possible until you try. Happy strumming! ",

            "answer_text": "The age old adage, practice! Joining a club is a great way to help. It tends to push you to learn new chords, makes you more aware of the music side of things and gives you a good support base. It can also help with performance anxiety! Club meetings typically have an open mic at the meetings, a really \u2018safe\u2019 place to get up and perform and work out before going to a more public location. Attend workshops with professionals and skilled players. Finding a couple of good teachers can make a world of difference. Learning the basic foundation of the instrument and its abilities can be a big help, as well as building a starting foundation of music theory. My book, Unlock Your Ukulele, can help with that! ",
