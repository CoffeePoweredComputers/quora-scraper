            "answer_text": "\u201c Is it racist if an Arab gets box braids or corn rows ?\u201d In real life or on Quora ? In real life racism has to do with looking down on or even mistreating people on account of \u201c race.\u201d On Quora there is no telling what racism means , but it is seemingly a widespread and difficult phenomenon to spot given how many Quora questions begin with Is it racist to \u2026.then giving many presumably relevant details. In real life asking if something is racist is like asking if Bob Gibson is throwing at you. If he is throwing at you , you will know and you will probably be on your ads. It is not a phenomenon about which there need be much doubt. A spheroid traveling at 95 mph right under your chin -yes he is throwing at you. ",
