            "answer_text": "Yes. it\u2019s more than capable. But let me clarify something. Any Daw (digital audio workstation) is capable of making hit records. Protools, Logic, Ableton, Cubase, sonar, Fl Studio, studio one, etc are very capable of making hit records. They all pretty much to the same thing except in different ways. It\u2019s not the software. It\u2019s the engineer, music production, and artist that are responsible for creating the hit record. Not the software. The software is nothing more than digital 1\u2019s & 0\u2019s. It\u2019s the man or woman behind the software tweaking the parameters that gives it a sonic characteristic. ",
