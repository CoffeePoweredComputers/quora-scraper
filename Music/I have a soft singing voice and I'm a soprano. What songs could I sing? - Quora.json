            "answer_text": "It sounds like you may be in the beginning phases of your vocal training -- pardon me for making that assumption, if I'm wrong. This is a question for your voice coach, not for all of us on the internet. If your coach doesn't have any ideas or doesn't seem concerned, then you either should stop worrying about the qualities of your voice and put your trust in your coach, or find a new coach who you do trust. It sounds like the latter might be a good option for you, especially if your coach is telling you that \"you just have a soft voice.\" It's unlikely that you possess a voice that only works at softer dynamics. Learning to produce a wide dynamic range is an essential skill for any singer. Don't limit yourself by thinking you won't be able to sing with a stronger voice. I had a similar limitation when I was studying vocal technique many years ago: I had a very small range of notes, less than an octave, that I could sing. I didn't think I'd ever get beyond that until I found an excellent voice teacher, who very quickly helped me extend my range greatly (at one point, I could sing the D below the bass clef!).  Choose to fix the limitation you have, rather than reinforce it by finding material that's easy for you to sing. I'll leave you with one of my favorite Bjork songs, which is an excellent exploration in vocal range, for some inspiration:  ",

            "answer_text": "It's hard to make suggestions, because you didn't specify what genre you like and we don't know your skill level or voice. If I were you I would rely on teacher's expertise more than Quora answers. Couple of ideas: Dolly Parton's original version of I will always love you (more intimate and less power belting and runs that Whitney's), some Dido's hits from the early 2000's like Here With Me, Thank You or White Flag, or some song by Norah Jones (she is super soft). Remember that most artists will do both softer and more powerful singing in a song, depending on the lyrics and what they wish to express. That kind of dynamics makes it more interesting. Whatever you sing, try to do it in your own voice and keep finding your own style :)  ",
