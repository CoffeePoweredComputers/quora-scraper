            "answer_text": "If the deal is with an artist signed to one the big labels, producers can make an advance of anywhere from $10K to over $100K per song. Then there are backend royalties with can be anywhere from 2% - 4%. And these are general figures, there will be exceptions. And of course there are many other deal points in a producer agreement, but those are probably the essentials that would give you some idea of the money. With independent artists, there money is often nowhere near that. I\u2019ve seen producers charging as little as $200 per song, probably all in, no royalties. More realistic for such work is a minimum of $2500 per song, which takes into account the following; The initially structuring of a production, tailored to an artists style/referencesTracking the artists vocals and any other instruments that they themselves want on the recordVocal comping, editing, tuning and aligningFinishing the production, which will likely mean further instrument tracking, re-arrangeing/editing the existing material to highlight the vocals and ultimately develop into a hit song/production. That could also mean adding parts to strengthen the hook like adding a tag or drop.Pulling the whole mix together to present to the artist.Further tweaks and mixing as requested by the artistIf the artist intends to use the producer\u2019s mix (rather than send the production to a mix engineer - often the case with independent artists), then there will be a final overall mix and mastering session.I wanted to provide the detail above so that the fees I list here are not confused with \u201cbeat making\u201d, which doesn\u2019t usually include any vocal work or finalizing the production on the producers part - therefore usually not as expensive.

            "answer_text": "Music Producers have typically been paid in two ways: 1) an advance payment usually per track, and 2) a royalty rate which comes out of the artist\u2019s share of royalties paid by a record label. Advance payments can be as much as $100,000 per track (or more for a few mega stars) or sometimes done on \u201cspec\u201d ( short for speculation) where the Producer is taking a chance on something hoping the percentage or other parts of the deal pay off. Some Producers, for instance, may try and take a percentage of the artist\u2019s music Publishing on the songs they produce. When albums were at their peak, most in-demand Producers were receiving advances of roughly $30\u201350,000 per album vs. royalties that were Usually around 20\u201325% of the artist\u2019s share. Local producers, often owners of recording studios are more likely to receive $500\u20131500 per track which may include studio time. Pre-1970, most producers of major artists worked for the record label and were paid by the label. George Martin was an employee of EMI when he was producing the Beatles. Mitch Miller was probably one of the most famous in the U.S. Today, as streaming has replaced sales, one of the big issues facing older producers is how to ensure that they receive royalties from streaming when their 20 or 30 or 40 year old contracts never mentioned it.
