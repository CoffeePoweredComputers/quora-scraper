            "answer_text": "What you need to be able to play to do your job varies according to your job. However, there are standards when you\u2019re learning to become a music teacher in the US. To become a public school music teacher in the US you must pass the general and music certification tests and have a bachelor\u2019s degree in music education. A bachelor\u2019s degree in music education has instrument proficiency requirements that all students must pass, and it prepares you to teach most music subjects in grades K-12. You can\u2019t specialize in primary (elementary school) or secondary (high school), even if all you want to do when you graduate is become a high school band director. I\u2019m sure different universities vary in their requirements, so do look them up or call them to ask about this question. We had to have a major instrument (mine was cello) on which we were required to perform in recitals. Basically the major instrument was the one we were expected to be really good at. If your major instrument was a string instrument you had to be in the orchestra. If you were a brass or percussion player you had to be in the marching and concert bands for at least two semesters. All music education majors had to pass a piano proficiency test that was really quite difficult. We all had to be in the university choir for a specific number of semesters. All music education majors had to pass a fairly simple guitar proficiency test. (It really wasn\u2019t enough to enable one to use the guitar in class, but we did have to learn a bit.) We had to take a class in all of the major areas of instrumentation\u2014 we had one-semester class of winds (flute, clarinet, oboe, bassoon), one of brass (trumpet, trombone, tuba), one of strings, and one of percussion. We were encouraged to take additional lessons in other instruments, for which we would get credit. And it was free to us, so why wouldn\u2019t you? I took tuba for two semesters, bass lessons, marimba lessons, and vibraphone lessons. I was also in the marching band as a drummer and the percussion ensemble and the jazz band. ",

            "answer_text": "As indicated in other answers, private (individual) teachers of music and classroom teachers of music will usually draw on different constellations of skills. The emphasis with private teaching is (most often) a highly-specialized knowledge of and advanced performing skill on the instrument in question. Some of these who are not piano teachers will also play piano with a relatively high degree of skill. Speaking personally, cello is my principal instrument and so I have the highest level of confidence in my teaching skills on that instrument. My guitar and viola da gamba performing skills are relatively less advanced but my understanding of pedagogy and technique still enables me to teach them well. In a classroom setting, the teacher might also have a principal instrument for which they possess a high degree of performing ability. However, their priority needs to be the development of a broad generalist knowledge of all the instruments played in their classes. In my training as a classroom music teacher (a career path that I didn\u2019t pursue, in the end), I took courses in flute, oboe, clarinet, trumpet, trombone, horn, and percussion. I also had a course in violin but frankly that, viola, and double bass are all similar enough to cello that they weren\u2019t much of a mystery. Of course, the classroom teacher is not going to play all those different instruments on a regular basis but I think they need to have experienced playing all of them in order to understand and to explain to students more clearly how to play.
