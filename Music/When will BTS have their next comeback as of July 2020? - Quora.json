            "answer_text": "A few days ago, they released a (primarily) Japanese album, called Map of the Soul: 7 The Journey. All of the songs were Japanese versions of some of their new songs, as well as some of their older popular songs. The only ones that were Korean were (the intro/outro ofc), Lights, Your Eyes Tell, and Stay Gold. There have been rumors that BTS is having a comeback sometime in fall, like October or November. I\u2019m not sure if Bighit has actually said anything, or maybe the members accidentally have. *cough*Namjoon*cough*Edit: They\u2019re releasing a new album, \u201cBE (Deluxe Edition)\u201d in November! But anyways, nothing\u2019s for sure yet. (Ok it may be, but the fans don\u2019t know yet.) And I still wanna see a filter dance ahhh!!!! Please!!! :/ Hope this helps! -Rey  ",
