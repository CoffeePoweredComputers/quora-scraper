            "answer_text": "It's about the fact that humans are not able to share the wonderful gifts that they have been given: \"God\" put them in the Eden (which is our Earth), and they divided it with borders and Nations and they are constantly fighting each other to conquer more land instead of enjoying it together; God gave them reason and they choose war; God gave them thumbs and they use them to forge weapons. That's why angels look at humans with contempt: humans have the possibility to achieve great things (\"to lift an eye to heaven\") but they are wasting it because of their wretched nature. ",
