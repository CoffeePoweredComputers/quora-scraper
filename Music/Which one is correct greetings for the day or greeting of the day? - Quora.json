            "answer_text": "As something to say to someone as a greeting neither of these is usual. You may occasionally hear \u2018Greetings!\u2019 but it\u2019s generally used slightly humorously or hyperbolically (i.e. in a deliberately exaggerated way). As to what people do say, well, there are a lot of options and many regional (as well as national) variations. A few, randomly selected, some informal some less so:- Hi!, Hi there!, Hello!, Caio!, How do?; Good day or , more commonly, Good morning, Good afternoon, or Good evening, [but not Goodnight] or, in Australia: G\u2019day); these are sometimes abbreviated in informal situations, i.e. Morning!, \u2018Afternoon! etc; How are things, How are you? How\u2019s tricks? Alright? Howdy! Among the younger generation you\u2019ll hear things like whatup?, sup, hey! If you want something that will really confuse most people, try \u2018Fit like?\u2019 (How are you?),the reply is \u2018nae bad\u2019 or there\u2019s \u2018Foos yer doos?\u2019 (Literally how are your doves [pigeons]) the reply to which is \u2018Aye peckin awa!, peckin awa!\u2019; both of these are from Doric, the dialect of NE Scotland.

The first meaning is that you are literally greeting the day or saying \u201chello\u201d to the day. The second refers to a particular way that you plan to greet everyone that day. For example, you may decide that, today, you will greet everyone with \u201cHow are you on this fine day,\u201d whereas tomorrow, you may decide that your greeting of the day is \u201cTop of the morning to you.\u201d ",
