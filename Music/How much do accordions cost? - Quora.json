            "answer_text": "The cost of an accordion depends on the exact type and quality of accordion and its condition. Patience and careful shopping on the used market\u2014EBay, Craigslist, etc.\u2014can get you a decent, playable accordion (piano or button) for $200 to $400. A new accordion from a high-end maker can cost $12,000. Look for Italian or German made instruments. I got my accordion for free when I found it in an abandoned locker I was cleaning out and the building owner let me keep it. It\u2019s of good quality and all the notes work and are in tune\u2014but I was surprised to find a similar one on EBay for just a few hundred dollars. ",
