            "answer_text": "As far as we are aware, Lisa\u2019s real height is 166.5cm compared to her official profile (167). That .5cm could be a fluctuation, and Lisa\u2019s weight was recorded at just under 45kg (her official weight). I would guess that Blackpink\u2019s heights and weights are fairly close to their officially listed stats. I\u2019ve heard a lot of people say that \u201cJisoo can\u2019t be 45kg\u201d but for a fairly short girl like Jisoo, 45kg is plausible since her bones are quite small (Jisoo still looks small-framed next to Lisa and Rose and both of them insanely small-framed). People often have no idea what 99 lbs looks like on a short Asian gal. If YG is being fairly truthful when it comes to weight, I would say that the member\u2019s real heights are probably very close to their official listings. Jisoo wears heels very often and in the photos where she appears taller than Jennie, it\u2019s quite obvious that her heels are taller due to the way her foot looks.  This photo seems like the best basis for comparison as everyone wears similar shoes and poses similarly. Jennie looks to be taller than Jisoo and they are angling their heads and posing in a similar way, but not by much. Jennie looks to be about 2\u20132.5in shorter than Rose which is in-line with their official profile. Lisa looks at least 2 inches taller than Jisoo. Since we know that Lisa is actually about 5\u20325.5, we can assume that Jisoo is about 5\u20323.5 which slightly shorter than her official height (listed as 5\u20323.8 or so). The discrepancy is not much. AND Lisa\u2019s shoes look slightly taller, so in reality To me, it always seems that Rose and Lisa are wearing similar shoes so if you compare other pictures of them side by side, Rose is clearly the taller one, by .5\u20131 inch.  In this photo it seems that Lisa and Rose\u2019s ankles are in line and they are both standing fairly straight. Rose looks a bit hunched over though\u2026 Rose is definitely the taller one by perhaps closer to an inch, so I would say that Rose\u2019s height is accurate. I would guess that Blackpink\u2019s real heights and weights are not too different from their official heights and weights. Lisa has gained some weight since debut and her real weight is probably a little heavier (I would guess around 46\u201347), while both Jennie and Jisoo have lost weight in the past. Rose seems to have had the most stable weight out of the four, so her current weight is probably around the same as her official profile. Either way, Blackpink\u2019s official heights and weights seem to be in line with their actual weights. ",

Jennie is clearly shorter than Jisoo. Yall maybe say it because of their shoes or camera angle but base in their proportion, Jennie seem quite small compare to Jisoo. Either way she look so cute right :) ",
