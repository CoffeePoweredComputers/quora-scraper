            "answer_text": "Mark Twain said that in becoming a river pilot (of a steam boat, which had been his lifelong dream) the river lost all its charm for him\u2026. here are his exact words. Perhaps you can take some comfort from it. (From Life On The Mississippi, by Mark Twain.) \u201cNow when I had mastered the language of this water and had come to know every trifling feature that bordered the great river as familiarly as I knew the letters of the alphabet, I had made a valuable acquisition. But I had lost something, too.I had lost something which could never be restored to me while I lived.All the grace, the beauty, the poetry had gone out of the majestic river! I still keep in mind a certain wonderful sunset which I witnessed when steamboating was new to me. A broad expanse of the river was turned to blood; in the middle distance the red hue brightened into gold, through which a solitary log came floating, black and conspicuous; in one place a long, slanting mark lay sparkling upon the water; in another the surface was broken by boiling, tumbling rings, that were as many-tinted as an opal; where the ruddy flush was faintest, was a smooth spot that was covered with graceful circles and radiating lines, ever so delicately traced; the shore on our left was densely wooded, and the somber shadow that fell from this forest was broken in one place by a long, ruffled trail that shone like silver; and high above the forest wall a clean-stemmed dead tree waved a single leafy bough that glowed like a flame in the unobstructed splendor that was flowing from the sun. There were graceful curves, reflected images, woody heights, soft distances; and over the whole scene, far and near, the dissolving lights drifted steadily, enriching it, every passing moment, with new marvels of coloring. I stood like one bewitched. I drank it in, in a speechless rapture. The world was new to me, and I had never seen anything like this at home. But as I have said, a day came when I began to cease from noting the glories and the charms which the moon and the sun and the twilight wrought upon the river's face; another day came when I ceased altogether to note them. Then, if that sunset scene had been repeated, I should have looked upon it without rapture, and should have commented upon it, inwardly, after this fashion: This sun means that we are going to have wind to-morrow; that floating log means that the river is rising, small thanks to it; that slanting mark on the water refers to a bluff reef which is going to kill somebody's steamboat one of these nights, if it keeps on stretching out like that; those tumbling 'boils' show a dissolving bar and a changing channel there; the lines and circles in the slick water over yonder are a warning that that troublesome place is shoaling up dangerously; that silver streak in the shadow of the forest is the 'break' from a new snag, and he has located himself in the very best place he could have found to fish for steamboats; that tall dead tree, with a single living branch, is not going to last long, and then how is a body ever going to get through this blind place at night without the friendly old landmark. No, the romance and the beauty were all gone from the river. All the value any feature of it had for me now was the amount of usefulness it could furnish toward compassing the safe piloting of a steamboat.Since those days, I have pitied doctors from my heart. What does the lovely flush in a beauty's cheek mean to a doctor but a 'break' that ripples above some deadly disease. Are not all her visible charms sown thick with what are to him the signs and symbols of hidden decay?Does he ever see her beauty at all, or doesn't he simply view her professionally, and comment upon her unwholesome condition all to himself? And doesn't he sometimes wonder whether he has gained most or lost most by learning his trade?\u201d If you are fatigued from music, pick up a different hobby (reading, perhaps- although if you are a composer by trade, that may be difficult to take time off from.) Or study a completely different type from what you write (Hawaiian music, Latin jazz, Mexican duetas or mariachi, 15th century lute, etc.) Also, check to see if your personal surroundings are causing you to be depressed, and if so, seek help. Music should not be a chore; it is the rhythm of life and culture, and if one type of music has left you burnt out, seek another. I hope you find joy again, soon. ",

            "answer_text": "First off, I want to say that I am a Jesus loving Christian. That being said, I find most music to be devoid of any real meaning. Many songs are about wanting something more, be it love, sex, money, etc. The only music that I see a meaning in is Christian worship and praise music. Before I was a Christian, I didn't like music at all. All I was hearing was empty words. The only songs I thought had a purpose were love songs. Looking back, I see that was probably because the artist was singing to someone or about someone. After I became a Christian, I was introduced to a new kind of music, Praise and Worship. These songs were essentially love songs to the God that I was just coming to love myself. They had a purpose with substance : to express devotion, gratitude, and repentance to God. So to answer your question, I believe that most music feels empty because of a lack of purpose. I encourage you to look up Chris Tomlin (gentle) Toby Mac (pop) or Lecrae (rap). Some of their best songs are At the Cross, Me Without You, and Tell the World respectively. I hope this helps. Please feel free to ask me any questions about my faith. I'd love to talk with you. ",
