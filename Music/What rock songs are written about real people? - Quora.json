            "answer_text": "Walk on the Wild Side by Lou Reed.  Each verse refers to one of the \"superstars\" at Andy Warhol's New York studio, The Factory. \"Holly\" is based on Holly Woodlawn, a transsexual actress who lived in Miami Beach, Florida as a child. In 1962, after being bullied by homophobes, the fifteen-year-old ran away from home; and, as in the lyrics, learned how to pluck her eyebrows while hitchhiking to New York.\"Candy\" is based on Candy Darling, a transsexual actress and the subject of an earlier song by Lou Reed, \"Candy Says\". She grew up on Long Island (\"the island\") and was a regular at \"the back room\" of Max's Kansas City.\"Little Joe\" was the nickname of Joe Dallesandro, an actor who starred in Flesh, a 1968 film about a teenage hustler. Dallesandro said in 2014 that he had never met Reed when the song was written, and that the lyrics were based on the film character, not himself personally.\"Sugar Plum Fairy\" has been described a reference to actor Joe Campbell, who played a character by that name in Warhol's 1965 film, My Hustler. The term was a euphemism for \"drug dealer\". \"Sugar Plum Fairy\" may have been a composite of a number of drug dealers in the Warhol superstars circle.\"Jackie\" is based on Jackie Curtis, another Warhol actor. \"Speeding\" and \"crashing\" are drug references. Curtis at one time hoped to play the role of James Dean in a movie; Dean was killed in a car crashfrom: Walk on the Wild Side (Lou Reed song) ",

            "answer_text": "Most of the ones I thought of have already been covered but here\u2019s some more: \u201cYou\u2019re So Vain\u201d by Carly Simon - for decades, its been a topic of discussion (I\u2019ve always thought it was Warren Beatty) but she\u2019s said that it\u2019s an amalgam of three guys - she\u2019s revealed that Warren Beatty is one but (I think) she\u2019s not said who the other two are yet. \u201cDr Robert\u201d by the Beatles was about a real-life doctor in New York who used to supply them with drugs. \u201cSuzanne\u201d by Leonard Cohen was about Suzanne Verdal, the girlfriend of Montreal sculptor. \u201cFire and Rain\u201d by James Taylor mentions another Suzanne - a childhood friend who committed suicide. \u201cWalk Away Renee\u201d by Left Banke was written by one band member who had a crush on the girlfriend of another band member. \u201cMartha\u201d by the Jefferson Airplane was written about Martha Wax, the runaway teenage daughter of the mayor of Sausalito CA who was a groupie for numerous San Francisco bands. For many years, I thought the line \u201cher heels rise for me\u201d meant she\u2019d run to him. Then I realized the truth: it was a reference to what she did in the missionary position during sex. Supposedly \u201cQuicksilver Girl\u201d by Steve Miller Band is also about her. \u201cPS I Love You\u201d by the Beatles - the PS was supposedly Peggy Sue from Buddy Holly\u2019s song \u201cPeggy Sue\u201d which was about the girlfriend of the Crickets drummer. So one girl inspired two songs! ",
