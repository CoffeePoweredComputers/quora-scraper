The new year has ushered in a good news for the fan community as the Canadian pop star Justin Bieber will visit India soon.

The other cities where he is scheduled to perform as a part of this Asia tour are Tel Aviv in Israel and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), according to a report by Elle India.  While his visit to India will be just for a day for the concert, it is nonetheless a great development. Now, the Times of India confirms that Bieber will indeed be performing live at the DY PATIL STADIUM in Navi Mumbai on a yet to be decided date between 10 May and 20 May this year. Beliebers, rejoice!It will be an exciting event to look forward to, not just for the Beliebers but also for Bieber himself.  In an interview with Jimmy Fallon in 2012, Bieber had explicitly stated his love for Indian food.
