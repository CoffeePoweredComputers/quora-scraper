Because it will sound like listening to the music thorough a tin can\u2026 Instead, you need either an Aux cable or a Bluetooth receiver, which allows you to pipe music through your radio\u2019s aux input. The Bluetooth receiver can use the A2DP profile to play music from the phone, while allowing your HandsFree profile to take over when the phone rings. If your radio doesn\u2019t have an aux input, then you should look at a cassette adapter or an FM modulator that hooks up to your antenna cable and feeds the signal directly to the radio. You can get cassette adapters with built-in Bluetooth, or you can connect a BT receiver to the cassette adapter\u2019s input cable. ",

If you can get your phone to pipe music to a monaural Bluetooth headset, it should be able to send it to the car, but you probably won\u2019t be impressed with the audio quality (it\u2019s voice-quality monaural) See the specs at: List of Bluetooth profiles - Wikipedia ",
