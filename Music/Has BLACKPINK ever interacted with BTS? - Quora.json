Jennie\u2019s a really big fan of BTS and BTS are even bigger fans of blackpink Like the time when Blackpink oohed and Ahhed at BTS\u2019s sick Fire performance And when Jisoo and V got to MC together (It was adorable, but I\u2019m not shipping them because I know that sometimes ARMIES and BLINKS fight, and I\u2019m not bought to get in that battle\u2026)    (V literally had his eyes on Jisoo, but I\u2019m not saying their dating, he may like her as a friend none of our buissness I think this was the MMa\u2019s plus I found this on google don\u2019t know whether to trust it or not) 6 times BTS'V reacted to Blackpink proving he was a Blink. - Allkpopdrama(Link) Redirect Notice (Another link) 8 Times Idols Put An End To Fanwars At The 2018 MMAs(Link) Remember, these images or anything aren\u2019t proof they like each other! If you want true info, you gotta talk to the humans themselves, and watch MMA\u2019s and stuff and maybe the grammy\u2019s. So don\u2019t start fan wars and don\u2019t get in. Fan wars And don\u2019t just take my dum illogical answer for it. ",
