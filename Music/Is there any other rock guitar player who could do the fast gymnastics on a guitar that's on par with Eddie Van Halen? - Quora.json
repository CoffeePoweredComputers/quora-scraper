            "answer_text": "There is no shortage of players who can play at or above EVH\u2019s technical gymnastics level, but I think the really important thing here is who can play with a similar liveliness and personality. Now that is a tough call. I don\u2019t think anyone has mentioned Vito Bratta, who was the guitar player for the 80\u2019s band White Lion. People have mentioned Vai, Satriani, etc, but none of them have same playfulness and personality of EVH. Sure Vai has playfulness and personality, but not same as EVH. I often have the impression Vai strives for odd/playful stylings for sake of it, whereas with EVH it just seemed like his natural voice. So back to Vito Batta, I would say he is the only guitarist I have heard who had something similar to EVH\u2019s guitar personality, but still managed to make it his own. Just listen to some White Lion music (especially their first CD), and you\u2019ll see what I mean. An amazing guitar player! I would put him in a list of top 80\u2019s guitarists that hardly anyone knew about. One other thing to add about EVH. He caused a massive movement in LA, whereby up and coming players had to play at least as technical as Eddie, and bring something of their own to the table. I read an interview with (or an article about) George Lynch, the guitarist from Dokken and Lynch Mob. Lynch talked about how once he started getting noticed, he became very protective of his technique. Lynch definitely brought something new, and to this day I don\u2019t really hear anyone that has Lynch\u2019s sense of tone, phrasing, technique (many players are way beyond him technically, but his technique was simply perfect for the amazing solos he was coming up with). He said that it was because of EVH that everyone in LA was basically trying to be the next EVH - and how the best players players were careful about revealing too much about their own guitar mannerisms. Interesting how EVH had that level of psychological effect on an entire generation of guitar players. ",

            "answer_text": "Ritchie Blackmore laid a lot of foundation for future guitarists with his performances on Deep Purple\u2019s \u201cIn Rock\u201d album. Listen to the introduction for \u201cSpeed King\u201d and the solos in such songs as \u201cChild in Time\u201d. He did them all before Van Halen even attempted them. His use of vibratos and guitar \u201cdives\u201d are legendary He once stated his goal was to be the fastest guitarist of his time. He proved this with the solo in \u201cChild in Time\u201d and recreated it 20 feet in front of me during the \u201cMade in Japan\u201d Tour of the early 1970s. Edit 10/28\u2026Rolling stone just released an article on Eddie which stated the following: \u201c\u2026Armed with the Frankenstrat, Eddie began making extensive and inventive use of the note-warping whammy bar, teasing out elephant roars, horse whinnies, rocket-engine bursts of noise, and disorienting octave jumps. He could make it sound like his guitar was laughing in disbelief at his own virtuosity. Many post-Hendrix guitarists had avoided the whammy bar, because it knocked guitars out of tune. Eddie, never a Hendrix devotee, had long admired Ritchie Blackmore\u2019s use of it on 1970\u2019s Deep Purple in Rock, apparently filing the technique away for seven years.\u201d ",
