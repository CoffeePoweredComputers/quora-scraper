            "answer_text": "Gee, in what context? I think in different situations, different circumstances, there might be different songs that were the most or best song ever to you. I will give you just a couple of brief answers. I went to Nam in the Spring of 72, just in time for the start of the Quang Tri Offensive. It has been said that the Tet Offensive of 1968 was the beginning of the end for US involvement in Nam. If so, then the Quang Tri Offensive was the end of the end. Everyone expected some small push by the North as they did ever spring, but in 1972 the North threw in damn near everything they had into the offensive, almost 200,000 troops came charging across the North/South border, All supported by Soviet advisors, Soviet piloted aircraft, N. Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong guerrillas. I remember at the height of the offensive in the providence of Quang Tri, the small number of US troops were on their own for several days until the Commanders in Saigon began to get an idea of what was occurring across the country. During one very heavy firefight with the NVA and Cong we were taking heavy mortar and small arms fire and there were numerous cries for medics. There was not much we could do as to try to go forward would be like walking into a chain saw. I happened to look up and walking out of the smoke and fire was a huge US Marine. That man must have been 6\u20323 and 250lbs, and he had one wounded man on is back and he was carrying one more under each arm and was standing tall like as if he were marching across an empty field of clover. He walked up to a group of us and as gently as if they were eggs, he deposited the three men in a ditch, looked at us, winked, and walked back in the same direction he had just walked out of, with mortars shells exploding all around him. At that very second,I thought of the Hollies song, He Ain\u2019t Heavy, He\u2019s My Brother. We never saw the big man again. Every now and again I dream about that day and in my dreams I still see him give a small sad smile, wink and disappear into the smoke and fire and I hear the words to that song echoing in my head.The other song that fits is about my wife, my ex-wife. For years after we divorced and she remarried, we remained the very best of friends. I have never loved anyone before or since as I loved her, I followed her across four states and countless camping trips. I don\u2019t think she really ever knew how much I loved and still do, but the song by the BeeGees, You Don\u2019t Know What It Is Like (to love somebody the way I love you). Hugs LJ. where ever you are. ",
