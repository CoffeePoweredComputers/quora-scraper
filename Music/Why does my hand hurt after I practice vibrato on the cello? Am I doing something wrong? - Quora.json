            "answer_text": "If your hand hurts, you are not doing it correctly. Many people think (and teach) that vibrato is primarily a forearm motion with a somewhat raised elbow and a straightish finger, but this is not really correct. I will explain. First of all, the most likely culprit is your left thumb. The thumb is NOT a clamp. It is there only for support and balance of the vibrato. I like to slightly hook my thumb by slightly bending the first knuckle so that the end of the thumb is directly opposite the vibrating finger. this way it forms a counterbalancing hook without the need for any tension in the thumb. Touch it very gently to the neck! The second culprit is likely the pressure you are exerting with your fingers. The fingers must be naturally curled, the way they are when you lift your hand straight up in the air, near your ear, completely relaxed. The fingers form natural hooks. I talk with my students about grappling hooks, which look just like fingers in this position. Use the left hand as grappling hooks, and use the weight of your arm, NOT finger strength, to pull the fingers down onto the fingerboard. In this position the fingers are naturally strong, without tightening them up hardly at all. Do NOT press, and especially, do not clamp with the thumb. Contrary to many teaching methods, the elbow should not be raised in the air, but should be in a natural position. The best way to find this position is to \u201canswer the phone\u201d with your left hand. When you bring your hand to your ear as if you were answering the phone, your elbow will find its natural height. This is the correct height of the elbow. Relaxed! Not raised. Here\u2019s a concept that is pretty cool. The default position for the fingers is all four fingers down on the fingerboard. You use muscles to lift them off the fingerboard, and when you relax, they should fall back onto the fingerboard! This is a pretty different concept, but it\u2019s true. Try it! The next issue is the angle of your forearm. We are often taught to rotate our forearm so that the hand is square with the fingerboard. This is also incorrect. The correct angle is slightly turned out. If you put your hand down by your side and relax completely, then bring your forearm up to the fingerboard (but DON\u2019T reach for it!) by bending the elbow, paying very specific attention to NOT twisting your forearm at all, you will find that your hand naturally is at an angle to the fingerboard, perhaps about 30% or so. This is the natural position, and the correct position for a very loose and beautiful vibrato. Keep that slightly turned out natural angle, use the weight of the arm to pull the naturally curled fingers down, keep your elbow at that natural height, at place the finger very gently on the fingerboard. In this extremely loose and natural position, you can now do a gentle vibrato originating in the forearm, but with a lot of hand motion and a very loose wrist. With the proper looseness (which is a little tricky to achieve because of our grabbing instinct!), you can now vibrate and the first knuckle of the finger will be flexible because of the lack of tension. With this knuckle flexibility and the general looseness described, you can get a beautiful, effortless, wide vibrato with almost no effort. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "The simplest explanation is usually the correct one. Without more specific detail, I'd say you are probably clamping your hand around the cello neck. The thumb should be under the neck in opposition to the finger you are vibrating on, but it should be positional opposition only. It should not me an active, muscular opposition. I think most of us when we are learning, go through this phase of tensing up and trying too hard. ",
