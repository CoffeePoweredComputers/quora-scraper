            "answer_text": "I have two idols who I could definitely imagine being in Blackpink! I\u2019ll be taking these things into consideration: \u2043\tAge: The eldest member of Blackpink is born in 1995, while the youngest is born in 1997. This means that their age range is from 26 to 24 (in Korean age). The age of the fifth member shouldn\u2019t be too far from either end, in order to keep a good group dynamic. \u2043\tHeight: The heights of the Blackpink members range from 162cm to 168cm. It would be ideal to not have a member who is noticeablely taller or shorter than the others, so as to have harmonious dance formations. \u2043\tFigure: The Blackpink members are famous for their model-like physiques. It would be important for another member to fit in with this, as we don\u2019t want one member being compared and body-shamed. Also, Blackpink do a lot of modelling, so the all members must be in shape in order to appeal to high-fashion brands. \u2043\tFace: The girls of Blackpink are renowned for their beautiful visuals. Similarly to the last point, we don\u2019t want a member being regarded as \u201cnot pretty enough\u201d and they should be photogenic so that they are desired for advertisements. \u2043\tSkills: Blackpink have a strong rap line, so another rapper position is definitely not needed. Blackpink have room to improve on dancing and vocals, so the fifth member could help boost the group skills in one of those areas. \u2043\tStyle: Each member of Blackpink has their own unique taste in fashion, as well as a stylish image to maintain. Their airport outfits recieve a lot of attention and always have to be up to standard. The fifth member should also be able to hold their own fashionable reputation. \u2043\tAura: Finally, the member should fit with the overall group image and dynamic. They should be able to suit both the black and pink concepts that Blackpink do, and have good stage presence. 2.\tDoyeon from Weki Meki \u2043\tAge: 21 (Dec 4 1999) - There\u2019s a considerable gap between her and the youngest member, which isn\u2019t ideal, but could be overlooked. \u2043\tHeight: 173cm - 5cm taller than the tallest member. I think that this could still be fine. \u2043\tFigure: Doyeon has a slender, willowy figure with amazing proportions.    \u2043\tFace: Doyeon\u2019s unique visuals are frequently praised! She is known for her stunning features.    \u2043\tSkills: Doyeon is a very good dancer, as we can see from her clean execution of Weki Meki\u2019s fast and energetic choreographies. She also has good vocals! \u2043\tStyle: Doyeon has a very trendy style which varies from quite edgy to more feminine. Her outfits are always well co-ordinated!    \u2043\tAura: Doyeon has great stage presence and has shown herself to be extremely versatile in concepts throughout her career in I.O.I and Weki Meki!\ufffc\ufffc    And a nice bonus picture from Jennie\u2019s Instagram...  1.\tSeulgi from Red Velvet \u2043\tAge: 27 (Feb 10 1994) - A little older the oldest member. \u2043\tHeight: 160cm - Slightly less than the shortest member. \u2043\tFigure: Seulgi is slim and has a very toned physique. She also has good body proportions.\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc    \u2043\tFace: Seulgi has a small face with monolidded cat eyes, a petite nose and slim jawline. She doesn\u2019t fit conventional beauty standards, but is definitely considered pretty.    \u2043\tSkills: Seulgi is an extremely talented dancer and also a strong vocalist. She could be a joint main dancer with Lisa, and either a main or lead vocalist. \u2043\tStyle: Seulgi has a chic and slightly androgynous style. She presents herself well in public.\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc    \u2043\tAura: Thanks to Red Velvet\u2019s huge variety of concepts, we know that Seulgi could slay black, pink, or anything in between! She\u2019s a very charismatic and constantly impressive performer.    Here\u2019s a cute BlackVelvet interaction...  In conclusion, I think both would fit really well as a fifth member of Blackpink, but Seulgi in particular would be perfect! Thank you for reading! ",
