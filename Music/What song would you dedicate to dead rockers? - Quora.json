            "answer_text": " What song would you dedicate to dead rockers? I started listening to rock in the 1950s with the King and Buddy, and others who are long gone. As each decade passed, I listened to music change and develop. I heard fads come and go. But I tried to dance to it all. Now I am old, and I can hear the voices of the dead. YouTube and TV show me the past sometimes in black-and-white and sometimes in glorious colour. The rockers of my teens and these later years are forever young, forever agile, forever beautiful in their joy for their music. We lose too many. Death\u2019s scythe takes most too early. If I had to choose just one song, I know which it would be. I don\u2019t care what the lyrics are; I choose it for the beat, the vibrancy, the exuberance, and the brilliance of its creator. I chose the movie deliberately.   2 Pinterest pictures ",

The tracks were decided in the half our preceding. It relied on runner getting the tracks from the Capital Radio music library in the days when it was all on vinyl or tape. Normally a brilliant show I had loads recorded off the air to c60 compact cassettes. Alas they dissappeaed over the years. Music for dead rockers. My first choice would be \u2018Knocking on Heavens Door\u2019, second choice \u2018 Why Should the Devil Have All the Good Music\u2019. ",
