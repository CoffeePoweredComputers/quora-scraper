            "answer_text": "I wasn't planning on answering this, but I was quite surprised at some of the answers claiming, essentially, that humans can only distinguish 12 frequencies per octave, and that this is why we use 12-equal temperament (a musical system that divides an octave into 12 equal parts). Quite simply, this is not true. Why 12, and not 11, equal parts? I promise you, 11-equal temperament would sound quite terrible. So would 13. And if we can't distinguish between more than 12 notes per octave, how is it that many people can almost instantly tell when an instrument is a little out of tune? No, no, no. It all comes down to the math. Two notes sound good - musical - together if the ratio between their frequencies is a simple integer ratio. The reason behind this is multi-faceted and complex and very interesting - it has to do with physics and mathematics of sound, and biomechanics and neurology of perception, and I think I understand a small part of it, but let's just say it's out of the scope of this answer. The simplest such ratio is 1:1, unison. A bit redundant. The next most simple is 2:1, the octave. The octave is so fundamental that notes an octave apart are given the same name, and in many situations are treated as the same note. The next is the fifth, 3:2, and so on. You can keep collecting such frequency ratios (and therefore, notes) and add them to a set of notes that you could then arrange in order of frequency and call a scale. Why do we see a lot of seven-note scales? Well, a seven note scale is simply a likely outcome of an attempt to arrive at a set of notes (within an octave) that is large enough to allow for a decent number of different combinations to try, but for the notes to still sound good together. Five is probably even more likely, actually. A lot of scales of African and Asian origin are pentatonic i.e. have five notes. Why 12-equal temperament, then? Well it's a fairly good approximation to a bunch of fairly simple frequency ratios. And the equalness of the tuning allows changing key and other neat stuff mostly usually specific to western music. It's like, why do we see a lot of four-walled rooms? Well, we couldn't build a two walled room\u2026 (well without curved walls, anyway) and we're symmetrical creatures, and we like symmetry, and three-walled rooms would probably feel kinda weird. Same with pentagonal rooms. And then, like, hexagonal rooms and stuff - that's a lot of walls, and the streets around a bunch of hexagonal and octagonal houses and gardens would probably be a pain to plan and stuff\u2026 Doesn't mean there aren't triangular and hexagonal and octagonal rooms, it's just, rectangular rooms are more common. It was simply a likely outcome, that, looking for a number of walls to put around our room, we would arrive at the number four. The seven-note scale is a similar thing. ",

            "answer_text": "There aren't actually seven notes within an octave, but twelve. We represent five of them as \u201csharps\u201d or \u201cflats\u201d, so it appears as if there are only seven of them. Any note represents a frequency of sound. \u201cA\u201d is 440Hz. \u201cA\u201d in the next octave is 880Hz, exactly double the frequency of the previous. That's why, in spite of being totally different frequencies, they sound the \u201csame\u201d and we identify both as the same note. Now think about this: How far should the frequency of sound be increased from 440Hz, until the human brain can recognize the sound as a different note? If I play you a tone of 441Hz, you're likely to still hear A, because our brain cannot recognize the change; it's too less a difference. Just like how sometimes we can't tell the difference between two very similar shades of blue. But increase it a little more, and we can tell that the frequency has changed. This minimum difference is what is called a \u201csemitone\u201d in music theory. The exact difference differs from ear to ear, but a semitone represents a \u201csafe\u201d difference perceivable by most people. Do this successively twelve times, and you'll find that you reach 880. This is the basis for the theory of notes. There are an infinite number of frequencies between 440 and 880Hz, but splitting them into these twelve discrete ones helps us differentiate them the best. There are some who claim to be able to hear smaller differences in frequencies (i.e. recognize more than twelve notes within an octave), because they have a sharper sense of hearing perception. ",
