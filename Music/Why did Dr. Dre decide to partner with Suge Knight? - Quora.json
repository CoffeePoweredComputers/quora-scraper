            "answer_text": "There are two related questions, which when combined answer this one:  Why did Dre want to leave Ruthless Records?Why did he co-found Death Row Records with Suge Knight?As to the first one, fellow artist and RR stable mate the The D.O.C. became deeply suspicious of Jerry Heller after Ice Cube's departure from N.W.A, suspecting that he and therefore-guilty-by-association Eazy-E were cooking the books in their favour - stealing from him and N.W.A.*, basically. He wasn't alone, as MC Ren noted:   We felt he didn\u2019t deserve what he was getting. We deserved that shit. We were the ones making the records, traveling in vans and driving all around the place. You do all those fucking shows trying to get known, and then you come home to a fucking apartment. Then you go to his house, and this motherfucker lives in a mansion. There\u2019s gold leaf trimmings all in the bathroom and all kinds of other shit. You\u2019re thinking, \u201cMan, fuck that.\u201d - Wikipedia, ibid.  It was The DOC who first approached Dre about joining up with Suge to form a new label.  As to the second question, it isn't just the case that Suge Knight was at the right place at the right time - although that is certainly a healthy part of it. It seems clear that Suge initially shared Dre's ambition for taking West Coast rap and making it into a global, dominant genre, out of the ability of the Jerry Hellers of this world to corral or control....\"They dreamed of Death Row becoming the Mowtown of Rap music\". Suge showed a certain...facility...for short term results on the business side of things, leaving Dre to concentrate on the aspects he enjoyed.  Ultimately however, his vision just wasn't ambitious enough for Dre while his literally thuggish business practices made Dre deeply uncomfortable and caused him to leave his partnership with Knight [1].  To summarise therefore: Dre partnered with Suge Knight because Knight was a the right place at the right time to suggest an 'out' from Ruthless Records and appeared - at the time - to share Dre's vision for making rap music a dominant genre and global player.  * for simplicity's sake I draw a line between The D.O.C. and N.W.A., though as Wikipedia notes he \"contributed lyrics and vocals to N.W.A.'s debut album, Straight Outta Compton, Eazy-E's debut, Eazy-Duz-It\".
