            "answer_text": "I presume you mean without assistive devices. It depends. There is a spectrum of hearing loss, which ranges from mild to moderate, to severe, to profound. So different deaf people have different hearing abilities. For individuals with mild hearing loss, they hear plenty. But they are generally unable to hear soft sounds, or find it difficult to understand speech in noisy environments. As for those with moderate hearing loss, they are able to hear moderately loud sounds, but may find it difficult to understand speech with background noise. With severe hearing loss, they can hear very loud sounds excluding speech at normal conversational volumes. Even loud speech is difficult to be understood. And finally, with profound hearing loss, individuals don\u2019t hear much, except for very, very loud sounds or perceive sounds as vibrations. But they\u2019re unable to distinguish between noises. But as with all things, it really varies from person to person. Deafness is not monolithic, for sure. If you\u2019ve met a deaf person and are curious, you should ask them for yourself. They\u2019re okay with sharing, in my experience, as long as you\u2019re polite about it. :-) (*I\u2019m writing this as a hearing person who has had some experience with working with the Deaf, but may not provide a fully accurate answer. Please do comment and let me know if I\u2019m in any way mistaken!) ",

            "answer_text": "Hello! Let\u2019s define what deaf means. According to Webster-Merriam Online Dictionary (2016), it states: lacking or deficient in the sense of hearingunwilling to hear or listen: not to be persuaded<was overwrought and deaf to reason>The reason why I decided to add these definitions because The question is interesting. If you are asking what do a person with one less sense hear, then the answer would be, it depends on the level of their deafness. Some people can hear some to a lot, and some people may be deaf in one ear, and hearing in the other. There\u2019s whole gamut of what type of deafness a person has. Secondly, if you are asking what a person chooses not to hear or receive in general, then, that\u2019s a difficult question to answer! Let\u2019s go with the first one. Without hearing aids, cochlear implants,mor any other hearing assists, a deaf person would probably hear nothing at all, or if any, very little. The sounds that a deaf person may receive is not 100% the same as a hearing person in aspects of clarity and sharpness (unless the person has trained him/herself to recognize sounds formally). Hope this helps. Reference: https://www.merriam-Webster.com/dictionary/deaf ",
