            "answer_text": "No, Paul said the song just came to him at night when he was in bed. \u201cWhen silly songs come to you.\u201d He wanted to write a song for Ringo, a children\u2019s song, and that\u2019s what he did. It just is what it is. It\u2019s one of those songs some Beatles fans dislike because of it\u2019s nature. I love it, I love that side of The Beatles that could just knock off something like this and it\u2019s all fun and then becomes an animated film. I\u2019ve always wondered if there is a demo of it in the vaults with Paul on vocals. Maybe just him and an acoustic guitar. I\u2019d love to hear it. Michael Jackson was going to make a sequel at one time and there was going to be a CGI remake. In the Museum of Liverpool in Liverpool, you can go in a pod a sing to a karaoke version of it. I remember that we used to sing it at school during music lessons, along with Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. ",
