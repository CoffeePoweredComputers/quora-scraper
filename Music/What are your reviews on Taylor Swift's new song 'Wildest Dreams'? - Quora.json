            "answer_text": "Well I assume that when you say song , video is also incorporated into it. Wildest Dreams, the 9th track on Taylor Swift's multi-platinum album 1989, is easily one of the best singles she has ever put out. The song captures the remorse with a level of maturity. The song deals the insecurities that one faces after having had some rash experiences in relationships, friendships or, for that matter, life.  I can see the end as it begins The line captures all of the insecurities in one go and that with ace. Taylor is known for belting out heartache and heartbreak ballads. This ballad may not give you much of the nostalgia of some heart wrenching songs like All Too Well or Last Kiss, but it, despite it's light words and pop tune, does touch your soul very simply. The melody oozes of Lana Del Ray's style (the chorus music just completes what lacked in her song Without You). Though chorus is one masterpiece and so are the stanzas, I find the first stanza unnecessarily cheesy  I thought heaven can't help me nowNothing lasts forever  He's so tall and handsome as hell are a few examples. The production quality is excellent, kudos to Max Martin, the chart topping genius (also the producer of her past No. 1s and radio No. 1s like Blank Space, Shake It Off, Style,  Bad Blood, I Knew You Were Trouble, We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together) Taylor aces the vocals really well. Her voice speaks of the insecurity and supplements the lyrics really well.  The video of the song is beautifully shot. The director is another genius, Joseph Kahn, who has shot Blank Space (the video with highest no. of views for any woman 1.127Billion at 12.46pm IST 9/3/2015) and Bad Blood (which currently holds the 24 hour Vevo record of 20.2 Million views in 24 hours.) There are some intricate details in the video, which I wouldn't spoil for you people. The storyline is simple and beautiful but it's the intricate details left here and there that make you watch it over and over again. Overall, this song, as already mentioned, is one of the best by Taylor Swift and easily deserves to be another No. 1 (although as an amateur trade analyst, I could say it might reach top 5 at most, unless some miracle happens). It might also get a Grammy nomination for Song of the Year. Thanks for A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it isn't \"new\" to me, considering I've had her album for about ten months now.  Wildest Dreams is one of my favorite songs on 1989, right up there with Blank Space and New Romantics. Like many of Taylor's songs, it's about a relationship, but it's a different concept that she usually writes. This one isn't \"I'm so in love with you\" or \"You broke my heart.\" It's, \"This romance is exciting but I already know it's not gonna last. And that's okay\u2014just promise you'll remember me well when it's over.\" It's very different from most of her music, and it's an interesting perspective, writing about a relationship's end before it's even over.  Things I love about Wildest Dreams: I love the dreamy feel of the song. It has a really cool vibe to it, and it's romantic and emotional. The lyrics and word choice\u2014especially the phrase, \"Say you'll see me again, even if it's just in your wildest dreams.\" I can't quite explain why I love it so much. But \"wildest dreams\" is such a dramatic and romantic way of phrasing it. And the way she sings that line, dragging out the world \"wiiiiiildest\" and then going up on \"dreams,\"  makes it that much more, well, dreamy.The concept, as I explained earlier, is so unique. Like, being in a relationship that you know is doomed should be depressing, but the song isn't depressing. She's focusing on what's good and interesting and valuable from it, accepts the fact that it won't last, and decides she's okay with it as long as he remembers her well. I don't know any other songs written like that.Things I don't care for: The sexual/inappropriate lyrics. I know, compared to most music these days it's like, nothing. I know Taylor's an adult. I just miss her old innocence. \"My last, request, ih-is\" at the end of verse two. The way she sings that just sounds so weird! The first time I heard it I think I laughed out loud and said, \"What WAS that?\" I thought maybe as I heard the song more it would stop bothering me, but ten months later it still bothers me. xDOverall though, I'm obsessed with this song. I never get tired of listening to it. I think it's beautiful and really showcases how far she's come as a songwriter. ",
