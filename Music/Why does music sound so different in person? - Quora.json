            "answer_text": "If I\u2019m reading the question right, another way to ask it is to ask the difference between live and recorded music. It\u2019s worth remember that almost all recorded music was technically live music at some point. Some bands \u2014 especially jazz and classical ensembles \u2014 record their music while playing together, all at the same time. Others do what The Beatles, for example, often did, which is to record individual parts until they come together to make the final song. But each part would still have originally existed in physical air, moving in a real space, going into the microphone. The first difference comes largely from the process of getting that air into a form that\u2019s reproducible and repeatable. The mics used to capture those sound waves all work in different ways and will \u2018colour\u2019 the sound accordingly. That\u2019s compounded by the location where the mic or mics are placed, as some resonances are going to be muted and others resonated depending on the outcome of that decision. This is partly why jazz and classical recordings \u2014 which usually aim to capture the performance as realistically as possible \u2014 still never fully recreate the sound of an in-person performance. When you get into rock and pop music, the differences are amplified by use of effects like compression (which makes the loud noises quieter and the quiet noises louder for consistency), EQ (which manipulates each instument\u2019s frequency for clarity), and reverb (which can make the sound feel like it\u2019s in a whole different space). In those latter styles, performances will also often be recorded several times and \u2018comped\u2019 together to create the best possible recording, polishing away many of the \u2018blips\u2019 you might hear in a live show. Finally, the last difference is you! In a live setting, the place where you\u2019re receiving the sound waves is going to impact how you hear them. That music is going to bounce off the walls and the floor, and it\u2019ll reach you at a slightly different time it reaches that other person five feet back. All of this is eliminated when you\u2019re piping music straight from your headphones to your ears. Ultimately, those differences \u2014 and the resulting advantages you get with them \u2014 are why we still love and consume both recorded and live music. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not just one reason. It\u2019s a litany of reasons. acoustics, diffusion, even your mood is in play. if you\u2019re comparing speakers with amphitheater\u2019s sounds, then my answer is that depending on how far you are, it sounds different because differences between the wavelengths is a really good way to make sounds travel faster or slower and even if it\u2019s not the sound it\u2019s the humidity and density of the air because of friction.
