            "answer_text": "First you need to start with the basics and establish yourself as its not an easy process esp breaking into the music industry on a \u201cprofessional level\u201d if your goal is to produce records for big label Artists and certainly not in only 6 months. You gotta pay your dues and start from the bottom like most people. As Veteran Record Producer Ron Fair says, there is no clear one way path you can take to become a Producer. Some Producer's started off as a Runner, a Songwriter, a Programmer, an Audio Engineer, Mix Engineer, Assitant Engineer etc. The vast majority of Record Producer's in the music industry are freelancers that run and own their own personal studios, while some run their own labels, production companies or Label imprints. Producer's are generally hired by Record Companies or label Artist's as \u201cIndependent Contractors\u201d via a long-form Producer Agreement to work on a recording project. Most major labels generally stick to the most established A-List Producer's that has a proven track record. Today is mostly that the Artist that is signed with the label hires the Producer. The best advise I can give you is learn as much as you can about the music business, understand and familarize yourself on how the music business works. Understand how labels work and understand how music publishing works. I promise you, you can not do business without knowing about how the business and the game works. You will fail and get taken advantage of esp when it comes to dealing with money, publishing, and royalties. The three best books i recommand is All You Need To Know About The Music Business written by Entertainment Attorney Donald S. Passman. You may want to check out this book called The 11 Contracts that every Artist, Songwriter and Producer should know written by Entertainment Attorney Steve Gordon Esq. Last but not least which was one of my favorites that I've used as a reference is How to Be a Record Producer In The Digital Era forward by Veteran Record Producer Ron Fair. I would recommand setting up your own home studio, and plan a budget that you are willing to spend on recording equipment, software, and room acoustic treatment. Figure out which DAW you would like to use, try a trail version of Pro-Tools or Presonus Studio One Pro and pick a DAW that's more comfortable that suits your need to purchase. Most DAWs are around the $300 to $500 range. Next you are going to need a decent laptop or if you already have one and a decent condensor microphone. You are also going to need a decent set of studio monitoring headphones. Don't worry about studio monitors until you have enough money saved up but you will need some room acoustic treatment for recording vocals. You are also going to need an Audio interface to record vocals and be able to play back the Sound from your DAW. If your goal is to be more involved in the songwriting process such as composing and arranging the oringal music, then you are going to need a midi controller and some soft synths. Make sure you are at least register A writer's account with a PRO (Peformance Rights Organization) such as ASCAP OR BMI. Once you have your home studio setup, start learning how to record vocals, and learning as much as you can with audio recording and mixing. YouTube is a great place to learn how to record and mix. If your goal is to get more into hip hop, Pop and r&b production that are beat driven, there are plenty of tutorials on YouTube to get you started on composing and programming beats. Your next big step and finding talent to work with and establish great Artist relationships and build some kind of chemistry when working with the vocalist in the studio. You need clientee in order to survive in this business as building and establishing business relationships is very inportant. I highly advise getting yourself a solid Entertianment Attorney to help you with legal advise and drafting out legal contracts such as Song Split sheets and a Producer Agreement. ",

            "answer_text": "You dont. You may be good, but unless you have a lot of music experience and understanding of the basic tools used to produce music and people, you are basically adding yourself to the button pushing crowd. To be a successful producer you need a good understanding of music. Not just theory, but of the multiple genres out there. Even if you are trying to be a hip hop/EDM producer, having basic knowledge of rock, jazz, etc will help. You also need to understand people. If you have been in music projects, you must have learned how to work with others. It is extremely import to know how to work with people. There are many types from those with open minded attitudes to premadonnas. It can take years but this should not discourage you. You can start now with these basic skills. Work hard at it. The amount of commitment and heart you put into will determine the outcome. Also, decide whether you are interested in just the money or the long term aspects of producing. If you are into for just the money, sell everything now. Just the money alone is not a basis to be a producer. ",

            "answer_text": "You can not. And that is for several reasons. Experience - it might take months to learn the basics but years to master them. Add to it being up to date with the latest tech, tools, hardware and software. You can not learn so much in just 6 months.If you already are a musician, you have an advantage. Music knowledge is as important as knowing your tech and tools.Some say it takes up to 10 years to train your ears and brain to a certain level that will allow you to hear music and sounds as the best people in the business. Experienced producers will say \u201cthere is an unpleasant resonance around 2kHz, and the 150Hz should be tamed with more compression\u201d.",
