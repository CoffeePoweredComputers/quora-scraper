            "answer_text": "Queen first toured the US as a support act in 1974. They returned as headliners the following year. Queen had supported Mott The Hoople on a UK tour in November 1973. Their first headlining UK tour took place the following March and April 1974. Both tours had been successful for them and they were ready to broaden their horizons. Once again Mott The Hoople provided the opportunity and Queen set off to support them on a major US tour. Their first date was on April 16, 1974, at Regis College, Denver, Colorado. After twelve more dates, they arrived in New York, to start seven consecutive performances, over six days at the Uris Theatre (now the Gershwin Theatre), on Broadway. On the fifth night Brian collapsed after coming off stage. He was diagnosed with hepatitis, thought to have come from an injection which had given him gangrene on tour in Australia back in January of the same year. The final New York gig was cancelled and Mott The Hoople continued their tour with various bands hastily booked to replace Queen, supporting different dates. Queen flew home, Brian went into hospital and in June 1974 his bandmates started work on the next album, Sheer Heart Attack, without him. Queen's first US tour as a headlining act also suffered from a few cancellations due to illness. However, this time it was Freddie's throat that was the problem. The tour commenced at The Agora, Columbus, Ohio, on February 5, 1975. It ended after thirty-nine gigs, including two in Canada, at the Paramount Northwest Theater, in Seattle, Washington, on April 6. A course of antibiotics and some rest had allowed Freddie\u2019s throat to recover sufficiently for Queen to finish the US tour. It also meant they were able to travel on to Japan for their first tour in a country with which they would form a special bond. ",
