I suppose we could \u201c lay down tracks \u201c in a studio, but are improvisers and inventors as a matter of definition. \u2026. music is a social activity. So I have been composing, mostly small things. Trying out new notation forms. Transcribing other works to learn and keep my ear fresh. besides playing the piano daily, I have been exploring watercolor. I miss playing so much. Never quite sure when it will be safe again. ",

I\u2019ve also been making little videos of either piping, playing guitar and singing, reading poetry, and that sort of things, and posting them to Facebook, just to keep people entertained. Not trying to make any money at it. ",

A very serious hobby, but my medical day gig has been the best decision I ever made. I do miss playing music live during this pandemic, but i don\u2019t have to worry about keeping the lights on, and I very much sympathize with those pro musicians who do. ",
