            "answer_text": "The first culprit is almost always not having stretched a new set of strings. Pull the middle of each string away from the neck about an inch or so and hold it for 10 seconds, do that for each string and retune. (Retune at the headstock end with the bolts loose then lock them down. The little ones at the bridge are for fine-tuning at a later date.) That almost always settles down tuning for me. If it's still all over the place the next candidate is probably the tension springs on that lovely floating bridge. I'd say if it was tuned perfectly once, it probably won't need doing again unless you change gauge or brand of strings; my experience is that changing like-for-like is usually ok (once stretched, see above). Continue reading this only if you're comfortable working on your guitar\u2019s innards. Behind the back panel of the guitar there are springs attached to screws into the wood of the guitar, and you can tighten or loosen these screws to adjust how much tension there is pulling the strings tight. Too little and all the strings will be forever flat and vice versa. If you haven't done it before be warned it's long and tedious work getting a floating bridge balanced: give a quarter-turn on the screws, retune the guitar as best as possible, see how close the tuning is, repeat repeat repeat until perfect.

            "answer_text": "There can be several reasons for guitars becoming \u201cuntuned\u201d. First, since you have a tremolo bridge it is very possible that the tension springs are either not adjusted correctly or they are worn out. Since you are asking this question I strongly suggest that YOU do not attempt these adjustments. Time for a trip to the guitar tech or music store. I am guessing that since you mentioned \u201cwrong strings\u201d that the guitar has to be set up again\u2026 those tremolos are very sensitive to changes in string gauges Second, make sure that you are loosening the nut before trying to tune. Once you get it in tune that way lock down the nut and fine tune using the knurled thumbscrews on the bridge. Third, if what you mean by getting untuned so easily is that you have to tune it every time you play, well, this is something you should get used to doing. Every time I pick a guitar up I take a little time to check the tuning and if necessary to do the deed. Technique is another thing\u2026 if you are constantly fooling around with the whammy bar you will not get away from tuning almost constantly. Soooo, take the guitar to a shop. They can tell you almost instantly what you\u2019ll need to do, and again DO NOT attempt it yourself. Not this time anyway\u2026 maybe next time. ",
