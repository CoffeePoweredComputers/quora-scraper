            "answer_text": "This image, released in 2019, was taken in April 2017, but processing the data took some time (source: NASA/JPL Edu):  It\u2019s an image of a black hole\u2019s silhouette: M87*, located at the center of the gargantuan elliptical galaxy Messier 87, or M87, 53 million light-years (318 quintillion miles) away. It was, it is a huge achievement. Yet many people were disappointed. They compared this image to artists\u2019 renderings and Interstellar\u2019s CGI, totally missing the point.  Beethoven\u2019s Kurf\u00fcrstensonaten are in a somewhat similar situation. Many people, including some professional musicians, are dismissing them as \u201cjuvenile\u201d, \u201clacking a distinct musical identity\u201d\u2026 I think that they are missing the point. Yes, they are blurry images; but the blurry images of Beethoven\u2019s later sonatas. And they are not as blurry as the image of M87*. You can hear the echoes of the style of C. P. E. Bach in them, but also the foreshadowing of Beethoven\u2019s later works. There is a bit of awkwardness in some of the transitions, and the ornamentation is a bit excessive; but get over these, and you can catch a prevision of the Path\u00e9tique, and nab methods and building blocks of his symphonies, decades before he wrote them. If pianists like Mikhail Pletnev, Emil Gilels, Jand\u00f3 Jen\u0151, J\u00f6rg Demus, Ronald Brautigam, Ulrich St\u00e6rk, and probably many others deemed these sonatas worthy to be played in recitals and/or recorded alongside Beethoven\u2019s other sonatas, who am I to argue with them? Just kidding, I love to contradict famous people; but in this case I happen to agree with those who believe that these works belong with the rest of Beethoven\u2019s sonatas. The current practice of treating them as \u201clesser works\u201d is hardly justifiable. Compare these works and the Opus 49, then compare the Opus 49 and the Hammerklavier. If we leave these out, maybe we should leave out the Opus 49 too. But if you ask me, Beethoven wrote 35 sonatas. ",

            "answer_text": "They belong with other juvenile works of his - they are more for curiosity\u2019s sake. And just for sheer completeness. If he had considered them worthy of being included with his published, numbered works, he would have included them. My guess is that he would be absolutely horrified that they are being played at all. I think it\u2019s fine to play them out of curiosity, but I wouldn\u2019t publish them along with the 32 unless it\u2019s a complete works edition where you are including absolutely everything. And then in a separate volume. It\u2019s hard to know where to stop with a composer - should we perform everything, even the pieces they wrote at the age of 6? In his teens, Beethoven wrote a trio for flute, bassoon and piano. We bassoonists don\u2019t have a lot of chamber music (by Beethoven or anyone else), so it\u2019s very tempting to play it and many people do. But I just can\u2019t bring myself to do it - it\u2019s mediocre at best, is not gratifying to play (it\u2019s very badly written for the instrument) and I can\u2019t help feeling he would have been very unhappy to know that future generations had gotten their hands on it. Then there is Brahms, who burnt all of his early works that didn\u2019t meet his standards - not just juvenalia but works he wrote as an adult. That seems a shame. ",

Even his most iconic piece \u201cF\u00fcr Elise\u201d is part of the Works Without a Opus Number. Even his earliest Piano Concerto, numbered 0, is also part of the WoO. Even though it is pleasure to play, it is not on the standard of the other 5 (6 if you count the transcribed Violin Concerto). So by going with Beethoven standards\u2026 no, these pieces should not be included in the 32 piano sonatas. ",

Just one example: I spoke to a friend about the evolution of Tchaikovsky's style throughout his seven symphonies. I was corrected that Tchaikovsky wrote six (because he was unaware of \"Manfred\u201d). In Beethoven's case, the three WoO 47 sonatas are juvenile works without opus number. Purely personally, I would accord them a status similar to the The \u201cTrois nouvelles \u00e9tudes\" of Chopin, which are relegated to the back of his op 10 and 25 sets. ",
