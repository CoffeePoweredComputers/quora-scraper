            "answer_text": "Q: What\u2019s the difference between reverb, delay, and echo? An echo is a single reflection from a sound source. The time delay is significant enough that we can clearly distinguish the reflected echo sound from the original source. A delay is similar to an echo, though the time between when we hear the sound source and the reflection does not exceed roughly 30 milliseconds. Within this 30 millisecond window, the sounds are not distinguishable as separate sources. They do play with each other in interesting ways though by doubling and warping frequencies acoustically. This effect is called flanging. A reverb is not discernible as a separate sound source from the original. But unlike an echo or delay, which is based on a single reflection, reverb is an amalgamation of reflections all mixing together into one indistinguishable body. The reverb decays at a slower rate than the source sound, so what we hear is a decaying sonic tail. Thanks, Dan WarnekeFrontier Sound FX ",
