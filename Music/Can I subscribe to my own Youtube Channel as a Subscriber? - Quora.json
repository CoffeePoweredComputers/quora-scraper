            "answer_text": "You can technically subscribe to your own channel from an alternate account, but that would essentially do nothing. The whole point of subscribing is to receive notifications for when said channel makes an upload, so you want real people as your subscribers, not yourself. I\u2019m assuming you ask this because you want to boost your subscriber count, so I\u2019ll just say this: There\u2019s no point, your channel would still have no community interaction (which is what you need for a channel to be successful).

Using another google ID might work better. ",
