            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. This question is trivially easy to answer, given that we can make a team out of main protagonists and antagonists of GER Giorno, DIO, Josuke, Kira, Diavolo, Johnny act 4 and Funny Valentine. But that\u2019s too easy. Which is why I won\u2019t be doing that, and instead I will form a team out of side characters only. Leader  Bruno Buccellati The leader needs to be strong of character: someone who knows what must be done, who can keep his composure at the most desperate times. This is Bruno Buccellati, the man who dared challenge the Boss after witnessing his power. Time and time again, he\u2019s shown to be a reliable leader, who genuinely wants the best for his team. His stand, Sticky Fingers, is no slouch either: while the ability may be kind of ridiculous with its zippers and all, he\u2019s still a threat. He can not only open passages in walls, but also split objects apart, open anything, create little pocket dimensions, and split himself apart to avoid attacks. It\u2019s a versatile, powerful ability that has many uses. Healer  Hot Pants Without access to prime healers such as Josuke or Giorno, I decided to pick Hot Pants and her stand, Cream Starter to fulfill the necessary healer role. My other option for this role was Foo Fighters, but their dependency on water is too much of a hindrance for her. Cream Starter takes the form of a spray can, and allows the user to spray a flesh-like substance that turns into regular flesh upon contact, which can not only push away foreign objects, seal wounds and the like, but it can also clog up airways and block the eyes, disabling opponents. The flesh can be used in small doses for free, but for larger quantities require absorbing either someone else\u2019s flesh through direct contact or the user\u2019s. It\u2019s a versatile, healing stand with offensive and defensive potential. As an added bonus, it can also be used by anyone as long as they can hold the spray can, which lets the whole party use the healing. Main Support/Utility  Yasuho Hirose One of the newer characters in this list, appearing in JoJolion, Yasuho is a young girl determined to help Josuke in his endeavors with her support-oriented stand, Paisley Park. Paisley Park has a range of abilities, all of which can help Yasuho and her teammates in a variety of situations: it mainly manifests unconsciously, by manipulating circumstances to achieve success. For example, it can cause a chain of events in order to disable the enemy for a short while, allowing its user to escape a tough situation. The biggest drawback of this ability is that Yasuho cannot directly control her stand, so she must rely on Paisley Park to make the right calls, which it inevitably does, even if it sometimes does it in a roundabout way. Its second ability is more straightforward, and completely under Yasuho\u2019s control: technology manipulation. Paisley Park is able to influence for instance, GPS apps. It can access recordings, or delete data from devices. Sometimes both these abilities combine, which significantly increases the stand\u2019s ability. Finally, it also has minor physical power, having a bit more strength than Yasuho herself, but it can quickly turn into a shadow or puddle-like substance to avoid damage. It\u2019s clear to see why the team would appreciate someone like Yasuho on their team. Main Fighter  Jean Pierre Polnareff One of the Stardust Crusaders, Polnareff is an extremely deadly close to mid-range fighter thanks to his stand, Silver Chariot: an ability properly summed up as \u201csword\u201d. Simply put, it can swing said sword around ludicrously fast, like when he cut a literal flash of light in half. If he can see where something is going, he can cut it. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s scary fast even without the sword, being able to create afterimages after shedding its armor. Oh right, and it has armor, a feature no other stand has, which lets it take more hits than it otherwise could. What makes Silver Chariot more special than any other close combat stand? Well, it has a sword, and anyone that\u2019s played Super Smash Bros can tell you that having a sword gives you a massive range advantage over any other melee fighter. Finally, if Polnareff finds himself outranged in spite of that, he can pull his final ace and shoot Silver Chariot\u2019s sword out like a very long bullet, though this ability is one-use only. Polnareff is an experienced fighter, with several tricks and overwhelming power that can defeat almost any enemy with a close-range stand. Long range fighter  Narancia Ghirga Yet another \u201cwild card\u201d character like Polnareff, while Narancia is childish, he is very efficient at what he does, and that is riddling people with bullets. Narancia\u2019s stand, Aerosmith, is a small plane with the ability to shoot infinite small bullets, drop bombs every once in a while, and has a radar to detect CO2 emissions. It\u2019s hugely powerful, and the only way to get around this stand is to hide around somewhere, and masking your breathing. Head-on, almost no other ability can compete with the sheer amount of damage Aerosmith dishes out, and its damage has not been shown to decrease the farther away it gets from the user, like when he inadvertently killed Risotto Nero. The radar gives him added utility, allowing him to spot enemies as well as use his stand even when he doesn\u2019t have line of sight. And just because it performs excellently at long ranges, doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t destroy you in close range. In fact, it can do it even better as Narancia now has line of sight. With unblockable projectiles by conventional means, and tracking abilities, Narancia\u2019s Aerosmith is a notable asset to the team. Assassin  N\u2019Doul A relatively easy choice for this role, N\u2019Doul is one of DIO\u2019s loyal assassins sent after the crusaders in part 3. While the man is blind, his senses have compensated for it quite excessively. Indeed, he can hear and feel sand move hundreds of meters away. But that\u2019s not the real reason he\u2019s here\u2026 N\u2019Doul\u2019s stand is Geb, which takes the appearance of water that he has complete control over. Its strength is not to be underestimated, being able to rip a man\u2019s head off and shove it into a canteen while hundreds of kilometers away. It\u2019s a force to be reckoned with, as it can sneak underground thanks to its water properties, as well as ridiculous speed, covering hundreds of kilometers in seconds. Its only weakness is that the user\u2019s target has to touch the ground at some point or other, so that he can feel his location and strike. Geb is ridiculously powerful, and with the help of his teammates I\u2019d say nigh unbeatable. Base  Illuso And for our final team member, I don\u2019t know how to express his role, but he\u2019s kind of like Mr. President (the turtle) in part 5 and Burning Down The House in part 6. His function is to give the team a place to rest. Now, why not choose either of those two examples? Both of those stands have one major problem, which is that anyone can access them if they know how to get in. Man in the Mirror though, has a whole separate dimension that he controls the entrance to. That\u2019s huge: he has the whole mirror world to drag his teammates into. They can store anything inside, and it\u2019d be impossible to get without Illuso\u2019s control. They can hide there as long as they want, and travel to any place they can go to on foot (can you use vehicles in the mirror world?). He\u2019s so much more versatile than either the turtle or the kid, plus he can do the whole drag-enemy-into-mirror-without-stand thing which is a really effective strategy. So in conclusion, my team would consist of Bruno Buccellati, Hot Pants, Yasuho Hirose, Jean Pierre Polnareff, Narancia, N\u2019Doul, and Illuso. ",

            "answer_text": "Create the ultimate fighting force out of JJBA Characters? Heck Yeah! Note: I\u2019m assuming that all these guys get along. Also note: Spoilers up to part 5!  1. So the first person on our team is DIU Jotaro Kujo. While I prefer his design in Stardust Crusaders, DIU Jotaro has an advantage in that he has access to The World (His Time-Stop). Plus, Star Platinum is pretty much the strongest stand in the first four parts besides maybe Killer Queen or The World.  2. On that note, our next team member is the serial killer himself, Yoshikage Kira! Killer Queen is a very big threat, as it can turn anything it touches into a bomb. Heart Attack is also an extremely dangerous move, as it is hard to destroy, and even harder to avoid due to it\u2019s heat-seeking ability. Of course, his final ability, Bites the Dust, is the most dangerous, as whenever he is under pressure, he can reverse time by an hour. Kira defidently deserves a spot on this team!  3. The third member of our team is none other that DIO himself (The Stardust Crusaders version). DIO is extremely powerful. As a vampire, he can drink the blood of his enemies to grow stronger. This also gives him extreme regeneration, and the only way to kill him is to get a headshot, then dissolve him in the sun. DIO\u2019s stand, ZA WAURDO, is very strong, with great speed and strength, including his time-stop ability. DIO single-handedly killed Kakyoin, defeated Polnareff (Hope I spelled that right) and Joesph, as well as almost defeating Jotaro. DIO is easily one of the most powerful, and dangerous, characters in the series.  4. Our fourth member is Giorno Giovanna, but after getting stabbed by the arrow in the Golden Wind finale. Giorno\u2019s stand, Golden Experience Requiem, is honestly terrifying. Not only can he heal with his stand, he can also change objects into living creatures (Such as when he changed Koichi\u2019s suitcase into a frog, or grew a tree while running away from him). After he stabs himself with the arrow, Girono is able to force his opponents to live out multiple deaths, causing them ultimate agony. To be honest though, he most incredible feat is the seven page MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA!  5. Our fifth member is Diavolo. Now diavolo is an intresteing character, because he\u2019s only half of the picture. Because of the fact that Diavolo shares a body with Doppio, he can get close to his enemies and get them to lower their guard, then come out and kill them with King Crimson (Or Emperor Crimson, whatever). King Crimson is able to literally CUT THROUGH TIME! Diavolo can see the actions his opponents will take in the next few seconds, figure out a way to counter said attack, and then legit skip time to get behind his foes. Its an extremely deadly ability that was used to defeat Bruno, Abbachio, and Polnareff. 6. Our last member is a legend in the JJBA community. He\u2019s strong, he\u2019s powerful, and he\u2019s more passionate than Inasa Yoarashi watching Shoto and Enji Todoroki make up (Chapter 176 if you\u2019re interested). It\u2019s SPEEDWAGON!  While Speedwagon isn\u2019t the strongest character, he has an important role nonetheless. He is the narrator! He explains to us in great detail what the main characters are doing with delightful commentary like: \u201dJotaro just beat DIO into the fourth dimension!\u201d or \u201dGiorno just executed at 90 degree turn and did a triple backflip on a positive X axis in order to combat his foe!\u201d Lets be honest, we all miss Speedwagon. Also, no one is beating the unbeatable force of: DIU Jotaro.Yoshikage Kira.Part Three DIO.Giorno Giovanna (After the arrow).Diavolo.Speedwagon.Thanks for reading! Note: I should make one of these for BNHA. ",
