Now, however, we are much more amiable. We can play with each other, poke fun at each other, and roast each other like pros. It is a love-hate relationship. :-) And I realised just one key change that brought this along: I spent time with her. Before, I wouldn\u2019t play with her when she wanted to, only when I wanted to. I wouldn\u2019t do DIY\u2019s with her, and we couldn\u2019t really connect. Over the last few months, she and I have become the only thing stronger than being sisters: we have become friends. She knows that she can Count On Me and that I will always be One Call Away. And I trust her enough to Lean On her. Setting Suns! Anush ",

It's really difficult beyond that without more information. I don't know if you're close as siblings or it's been strained for instance. Was she the advice giving big sister? The baby sister you always protected? Hard to give good advice to that question but anything heartfelt and meaningful that fits your lives will do it. Just nothing too romantic sounding or questionable. If you wonder, \u201cDoes that sound pervy or is it okay?\" Just know,if you have to ask then you know the answer already lol. Hope this helps! Ty.
