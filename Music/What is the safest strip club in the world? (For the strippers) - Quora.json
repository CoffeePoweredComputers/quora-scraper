            "answer_text": "I haven't been to a strip club in years but my guess would be, for whatever strip clubs are still in business, probably the post covid19 strip clubs. They've probably spent a crapload of money on glass shields surrounding the stages. Lap dances are probably no longer permitted as well. So strippers could be safer in terms of limited contact with patrons. Although, mask wearing could be a problem as far as not seeing someone's face if they get out of line. At the end of the day, there's always some sort of underlying danger for strippers. Those clubs attract a lot of scumbags looking to sell drugs, recruit girls to pimp out, and offer driving services. So there's always a risk. ",
