            "answer_text": "This is an old question, but it\u2019s The Beatles, so I can\u2019t resist making an answer of my own. We're talking about a band that is pretty much universally liked. With such a big and well-known repertoire of songs, it\u2019s hard to determine which songs are underrated. In fact, underrated is a pretty subjective term. Some of their songs are just subject to greater exposure than others, for some reason or another, and that\u2019s why they become the biggest staples when it comes to representing the band\u2019s career, or become that one song some poor fellow knows out of all on The Beatles repertoire. I think one of the biggest examples of such songs is \u201cHey Jude\u201d. Pretty much everyone knows this song whether they know The Beatles or not. The last part of the song also does an amazingly great job at making any sort of crowd go wild singing: naaah naah nah na na na naaaah\u2026 hey Jude This goes on for a couple of minutes and the fact that it is so exceedingly simple for anyone anywhere to sing it renders the song a lot of popularity. \u201cHere Comes The Sun\u201d also seems to gather a lot of attention as a standalone song. I know many people who really like this song, but don\u2019t really have a great deal of knowledge regarding The Beatles. But let\u2019s get down to business and analyze those songs which I, as someone who thoroughly enjoys listening to The Beatles, think are maybe somewhat underrated (and since, as I said before, this is entirely subjective, there\u2019s a great deal of, well, subjectivity going into which songs I pick). To the aforementioned songs, I can add some others which I think are not underrated and get their deserved share of \u201cLove\u201d, both from the band\u2019s fans and from the general public. These songs are, for example: Let it BeYesterdayBlackbirdHere, there and everywhereAnd I love herAll my lovingI Want To Hold Your HandAll these songs are sung by McCartney. Here are some by Lennon: A Hard Day's NightHelp!All You Need is LoveLucy in the sky with diamondsCome togetherStrawberry Fields ForeverIt has always seemed to me that Paul McCartney has always had the privilege of being the most appreciated genius in the band by the general public (I\u2019m kind of taking a guess, but I think he\u2019s a little more popular than Lennon). Even people who are not that into the Beatles know a bunch of their songs, and most of them are probably Paul's. But, to a great extent, that\u2019s due to the fact that he\u2019s the ONE iconic Beatle that is still alive, touring and spreading their music all around the world. On the other hand, I think George Harrison is the most overlooked of the three geniuses. Much of this can be blamed on Lennon and McCartney. They never allowed George to get anywhere near an equal share on The Beatles albums, when he started to develop his songwriting skills. Still \u201cHere Comes the Sun\u201d is the band\u2019s most played tune on Spotify. But George does have some more absolutely amazing songs that don\u2019t get as much of the spotlight, compared to Paul\u2019s songs: Something is easily the best love song of the BeatlesWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps is just fantasticI Need You is not a masterpiece by any means, it's the typical song of The Beatles early career, probably at the same level of \u201cI Want to Hold Your Hand\u201d. People, however, easily know the latter, but not really the former.Now let me compare some songs I think are underrated to the ones that are not, using Spotify\u2019s number of plays as a reference. The most played Beatles songs on Spotify are: Here comes the sun ~189M playsCome together ~133MHey Jude ~103MLet it Be ~99MNow here are some of the songs I love that are under 10M plays: Long, Long, Long - a little under 5M - Criminally underrated and it\u2019s so, so good. Its eerieness is really moving, and George\u2019s vocals are on point.\u201cMother Nature\u2019s Son\u201d and \u201cI Will\u201d - these two are IMO the most beautiful songs by McCartney on the White Album. I find both more beautiful than Blackbird, which is on the same album, and their numbers on Spotify are well below it.Hold Me Tight - 3M - Paul apparently doesn\u2019t even like the song, but I do. It\u2019s just such an energetic tune!Piggies - 5,3M - George\u2019s great critique of society.Being For the Benefit of Mr Kite ~7.4M - just wacky sounding, kind of reminds me of \u201cI Am the Walrus\u201d for some reason.These are just a few. The list could be much longer. It only includes some songs under 10M plays on Spotify, but even over that number, there are songs I think are underrated/underappreciated Another song that is really dear to me is \u201cThe Long Winding Road\u201d. It seems to me that the two most appreciated songs in the \u201cLet it Be\u201d album are the title song and \u201cAcross the Universe\u201d. While I think they are entirely deserving of the attention they get, I think the \u201cThe Long Winding Road\u201d is hauntingly beautiful, and I read it as some kind of sad goodbye letter of Paul McCartney to The Beatles career as a band. I think this one definitely needs more love. I can\u2019t really pick my absolute favorite song by The Beatles. Maybe if I was to be held at gunpoint I\u2019d go with \u201cYesterday\u201d, and although this one is not in the \u201cunderrated pool\u201d, I frequently find myself listening to many songs that fall under the radar of the general public. I love \u201cHey Jude\u201d, but I\u2019d never pick it as my favorite. There was a time when I was obsessed with \u201cIn My Life\u201d, but I honestly think I grew somewhat tired of it. Same goes for two songs in \u201cRevolver\u201d: \u201cHere, There and Everywhere\u201d and \u201cFor No One\u201d. Lately, and for quite some time now, the two songs which have been more consistently steady on my \u201cfavorite\u2019s list\u201d are \u201cShe\u2019s Leaving Home\u201d and \u201cIf I Fell\u201d. By the way, as a side note and since I mentioned it, the stereo remaster (2009) of \u201cIf I Fell\u201d is a complete trainwreck. I don\u2019t know why the hell they chose those masters for that edition. I much rather hear the mono version, which I can only find on YouTube. Lennon\u2019s intro is synced, and Paul\u2019s voice doesn\u2019t crack near the end. ",

            "answer_text": "What are some of the most underrated Beatles songs? I was thinking about this today (Monday, May 13, 2019), and trying to remember if I had already found the question here and answered it. Turns out that I did so last summer. On August 27th, to be precise. See below for that answer. I felt compelled today after listening to their albums recorded from 1967 through 1969 to revisit the question, and I now have to mention another song that I didn\u2019t talk about before. Even more importantly, I have to name one of the songs that I did list among my earlier choices as the single most underrated of all Beatles tracks. Both are from Abbey Road. \u201cYou Never Give Me Your Money\u201d should have been on my list. It\u2019s never mentioned among their greatest recordings, but it totally is. Trying to describe why has been frustrating, so just listen to it. The melody is sublime, and the guitar, bass, and drum parts are just beautifully executed both in playing and in production. See for yourself. \u201cThe End\u201d is the single most underrated Beatles recording. The Beatles use of guitar throughout their existence is a joyful celebration of the thing, and a testament to its status as the most important instrument in both rock and pop music. This song is the culmination of the three stringed-instrument-playing Beatles\u2019 abilities and sensibilities as rock guitarists. As they probably influenced all rock guitarists during the five years leading up to the recording of this song, they in turn were influenced during that time by others such as Clapton, Hendrix, Page, and Beck. One glorious day in July of 1969, they decided to record the guitar solo section of this song together, one after the other. McCartney went first, then Harrison, followed by Lennon. They took three turns each in this order, and I don\u2019t quite understand why the result isn\u2019t appreciated more than it is, because it\u2019s the best thing I\u2019ve ever put in my ears. Turn it on and turn it up as loud as you can. Old answer below: Here are a few that I feel are underrated: Roll Over Beethoven - Just a great-sounding recording. The beat is strong, the guitars sound great, and Harrison\u2019s vocal is just right for the song. This one should get more play than it does. Slow Down \u2014 Lennon\u2019s scream right before the tasty guitar solo is worth the price of admission all by itself. You Can't Do That \u2014 Great performance by Lennon, including taking a turn on lead guitar. Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby \u2014 Harrison\u2019s two guitar solos are a nice tribute to the players he admired as a young kid coming into his own. Think for Yourself \u2014 Another underrated Harrison song, with the added novelty of McCartney on \u201cfuzz bass\u201d. Taxman \u2014 This song is quite popular, but it deserves even more credit than it gets. McCartney\u2019s lead guitar playing is nothing short of groundbreaking. Such a great recording. Dr. Robert \u2014 Just a straight ahead rock tune, but with a weird little pre-chorus that brings to mind the effects of the good doctor\u2019s wares. Nice guitar sound on this transition-era cut. Your Mother Should Know \u2014 In danger of being a sappy McCartney throwaway, the recording of this song is excellent, especially the bass and piano. Really nice sounds. Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey \u2014 It rocks! The insistent firebell is a bit much, but somehow it works. The guitars sound awesomely nasty, and I love the one-measure bass solo right before the outro. \u201cHey!\u201d Savoy Truffle \u2014 Meaty horns, big sound! It just sounds very \u201cGeorge\u201d, and that\u2019s a good thing. The biting, trebley tone on Harrison\u2019s guitar solo is a convincing analog for the shooting pain of the toothache described in the lyrics. Hey Bulldog \u2014 This song is perhaps more popular than it used to be, but still quite underrated. The bass is incredible, the guitars loud and insistent, and it features a great Lennon vocal. The dog-barking and maniacal laughter are another reason to love this quirky cut. She Came In Through the Bathroom Window \u2014 Truly one of the best-sounding recordings, period. Great bass, awesome guitar. Like the rest of Abbey Road, the drums sound fantastic, too. Very much underrated. The End \u2014 The nine-part guitar solo in what should have been the final song on the final album is the crown jewel of the Beatles recording career as far as I\u2019m concerned. Who knows how many times I\u2019ve listened to it in one sitting. Probably around 25. The order is McCartney, Harrison, Lennon, three times through. So, that\u2019s a few of the more underrated tracks, but there are others! ",

            "answer_text": "With such an expansive backlog in The Beatles catalogue, there\u2019s a lot to choose from. Here a few of the underrated Beatle songs that I enjoy: Not Guilty  This isn\u2019t even one that made it to the White Album, despite over 100 rehearsals during sessions. It\u2019s a message from George Harrison to John and Paul regarding his limitations in the group. The result is a fantastic song that thankfully saw the light of day on the Anthology albums. I\u2019m Only Sleeping  This is apparently about John Lennon\u2019s laziness when he was recovering from Beatlemania. It\u2019s an early step that The Beatles made toward psychedelic rock. Hey Bulldog  Apparently many around The Beatles said that this was the last song that all four members enthusiastically participated in. It was a throwaway by Lennon, but I enjoy it a lot more than I should. It\u2019s All Too Much  This might by Harrison\u2019s hardest rocking song that he wrote during his time in The Beatles. It\u2019s a great song that was also a bit of a throwaway. I\u2019m a big fan of it. If I Needed Someone  This might be the best harmonizing that The Beatles ever did in a song. Lennon\u2019s backing vocal paired with Harrison\u2019s early writing makes the song. Julia  Lennon\u2019s ballad to his late mother is one of his finest songs on the White Album. It\u2019s a perfect way to end disc one. I\u2019ve Got A Feeling  The final 50\u201350 song from the greatest song-writing duo of all time, Lennon-McCartney is rarely talked about, but it doesn\u2019t disappoint. She\u2019s Leaving Home  It\u2019s a shame that this song isn\u2019t talked about as much as it should be. It\u2019s one of the finest songs on The Beatles masterpiece, Sgt. Pepper. The plot was taken from a newspaper article, which just shows how good Lennon and McCartney could take a mundane thing and create a masterpiece.  These are just a few songs that I would consider to be underrated. There are plenty more I could add, but some may not exactly be considered to be underrated. But when it comes to The Beatles, there\u2019s a 90% chance that whatever it is, it\u2019s good. ",

            "answer_text": "Hey Bulldog \u2013 I think this is the most underrated Beatle song ever.  John considered it a \u201cthrow-away\u201d.  Idiot.  The stand out for me, aside from the nonsense at the end which just made me love them even more then I already did, is the bass line.  I remember the big, shaggy blonde haired leader of the SDS movement at my university standing in the living room of our off-campus house while this blasted out of the stereo declaring for all to hear \u201cMcCartney plays that bass like a fucking machine gun!\u201d  He absolutely does.  (There are YouTube videos of musicians playing just the bass line from this song!)  One comment on YouTube said \u201cThis bass line owns my soul.\u201d  I get that.  It also tickles me that this song was made up one day when they were in the studio filming a promo for Lady Madonna.  Paul (bossy little thing that he is) decided since they were in the studio anyway they should use the time productively. They came up with this on the spot!  John had started it but only had a few bits and pieces.  It was originally called Hey Bullfrog but when McCartney began the barking business, it was changed.  The YouTube video is adorable.  John\u2019s mutton-chop side-burns, Paul\u2019s goofy sweater vest.  John holding a piece of paper with the just-written lyrics to read off of while they sing.  George looking confused.  Paul wiggling his butt while playing the tambourine.  Great stuff. Oh and the banter at the end?  It\u2019s considered a forerunner to rap!  Geeze, is there anything they didn\u2019t invent?   And Your Bird Can Sing \u2013 this is one of several songs that would NOT have been on my list had I made it 40 years ago.  The remasters brought this one to life for me starting with the amazing opening guitar duet between Paul and George.  Apparently this duet (as well as the one in the middle eight) is one of the first times two guitarists recorded a duet in harmony, live.  (That is, they didn\u2019t record separately and then blend together.)  Which it seems is a very difficult thing to pull off and that they did it flawlessly astounds even modern day musicians.  There is also the moment late in the song that I can\u2019t really describe, but it just gives me goose bumps.  When I read in one critique \u201cOne of the greatest musical Beatles moments ever is between 1:19 and 1:25 of this song,\u201d I knew exactly which part he meant.  I can\u2019t explain it in any kind of knowledgeable musical terms, it just soars.  I also love the lyrics although they don\u2019t make a bit of sense.  But John\u2019s singing is just so in your face \u201cBut you don\u2019t get me!\u201d By the way, John despised this song.  Idiot, squared.  (Interesting, there are multiple audio versions of this on YouTube, all different from each other but only the released version had the guitar duet.  The one version where they are giggling like maniacs is a gem!) ",

            "answer_text": "I don't know if these have already been mentioned, so pardon me if this is a repeat. I actually came across these two really good songs, and surely, underrated, by the Beatles. One is Maxwell' s Silver Hammer from their album Abbey Road. It has been sung by Paul, very graciously indeed. There's something really eerie about this song, yet strangely relatable. This is what Mc Cartney had to say about it, and I completely agree with his point of view, \u201cMaxwell's Silver Hammer was my analogy for when something goes wrong out of the blue, as it so often does, as I was beginning to find out at that time in my life. I wanted something symbolic of that, so to me it was some fictitious character called Maxwell with a silver hammer. I don't know why it was silver, it just sounded better than Maxwell's hammer. It was needed for scanning. We still use that expression even now when something unexpected happens.\u201d. For some, including Ringo and Lenon, it isn't a song worthy of many praises, but I like it. It's kind of whimsical, and most of all, experimental, in my opinion. I like the sound of it. And Paul - I love Paul's voice and his ideas. Another song that I feel is really, really underrated, would be Blue Jay Way. Oh god, I just truly love this song. It has become my recent favorite. And it is so damn underrated. It has this dark feels to it, something that you can listen to while driving, or when you are not able to sleep - on repeat, back to back. Idk, it just takes me into another zone. Goes without saying that George Harisson was the most underrated Beatles, for this song and for so many others, including, my guitar gently weeps. Apparently, Harrison wrote this as a joke song. And who could've expected this genius of a song to have been born like this? So, these would be my picks for the most underrated Beatles\u2019 songs. Check them out. And I hope you like them!  ",

            "answer_text": "Considering the Beatles are my all time favorite band and one of my biggest songwriting influences, I suppose I should weigh in here. I don't think it's really possible to find any hidden gems among the Beatles catalog because each of their songs is just so well known. And, in reading these posts I've found it amusing to see what songs of theirs people consider obscure or underrated. For example, I've seen about a dozen references to \"For No One\" (one of my personal favorites) with people calling it \"little known\" or underrated. I mean, it's on Revolver, for crying out loud, an album Rolling Stone named the 3rd greatest album of all time. Granted, it's not as well known as \"She Loves You\" but not exactly a secret either. And it's a song named multiple times on this forum.But anyway, getting in the true spirit of this, I'll name a few songs of theirs I do think are a bit under appreciated even if well known.\"For No One\" - Already mentioned, yes, brilliant; a quiet little 2 minute masterpiece that, at the time, shattered the line between rock and classical in a way no one had done to that point.\"Happiness is a Warm Gun\" -- trippy, surreal, biting, sarcastic, challenging/shifting time signatures. Wow.\"Cry Baby Cry\" -- achieves its lyric brilliance by mockingly superimposing royal pretension onto the desperate lives of ordinary people thereby magnifying their futility while utilizing the form of a child's nursery rhyme to support its theme. Extraordinary, true poetry.\"A Day In The Life\" -- the first \"alternative\" song ever. Again, pure poetry.\"I'll Follow The Sun\" -- Perfect, unpretentious little folk song. Sounds as if it wasn't written by a human but somehow has always existed since the dawn of time.\"I Am The Walrus\" -- Fearlessly, sneeringly original; pure, unbridled, creativity.\"Looking Through A Glass Onion\" -WTF? but cool. Best ending in the history of rock music.\"Back in the U.S.S.R. -- great parody, indicative of the Beatles' sense of humor.\"In My Life\" -- I've never seen anyone unmoved by this song.\"Two of Us\" -- Whether intentional or not, I've always thought this was Paul's way of summarizing his relationship with John and realizing it was ending; they'd had a great ride and were now \"on their way home\". That's purely my take on it, probably not what the song's about but it's what I get from it every time I hear it. These are just a few off the top of my head. This is exhausting, basically, I could name practically every song, especially in their later catalog, without running into one that didn't impress me in some way. If you want a few real examples of their songs that I think are vastly underrated and lesser known, I'll have to pick ones they wrote but that were primarily only covered by others. I'm talking about the songs like \"It's For You\", (particularly the Cilla Black version. If you haven't heard this Beatles gem, do yourself a favor and listen). Also, the song \"Goodbye\" that Paul wrote and was a hit for Mary Hopkins.  ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I'll make a top ten list: Girl- Written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, is one of the most underrated songs. For me is a extraordinary piece, the whole song, music, lyrics, are amazing.  And I love Her- Written by Paul McCartney and John Lennon, is the fith song in the \"A Hard Days Night\" Album. The most beutiful thing in the song is the spanish guitar played by George and the bongos played by Ringo.  If I Needed Someone- One of the first songs by George Harrison, testing his skills as a songwriter.  Happiness is a Warm Gun- Composed by John Lennon, this son is the story of Rock and Roll in word of Lennon.  I am Only Sleeping- Song written by Lennon, one of the most interestings facts about it is the guitar solo played backwards.  This Boy- Its composition was an attempt by Lennon at writing a song in the style of Motown star Smokey Robinson.   No Reply- The song is about a young man who is unable to contact his apparently unfaithful girlfriend, although he knows she is home (\"They said it wasn't you, but I saw you peek through your window.\")  I am Happy just to Dance with You- s a song written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney and recorded by the Beatles for the film soundtrack to A Hard Day's Night. Lead vocals are by George Harrison, whose performance in the film marked the first commercial music video segment with Harrison singing lead.  For no one- McCartney recalls writing \"For No One\" in the bathroom of a ski resort in the Swiss Alps while on holiday with his then girlfriend Jane Asher. He said, \"I suspect it was about another argument.\" The lyrics end enigmatically with \"...a love that should have lasted years...\" The song's working title was \"Why Did It Die?\" It is built upon a descending scale progression with a refrain that modulates to the supertonic minor.  I Me Mine-  is a song by the Beatles, written and sung by George Harrison. I Me Mine is the ego problem. There are two 'I's: the little 'i' when people say 'I am this'; and the big 'I' - is duality and ego. There is nothing that isn't part of the complete whole. When the little 'i' merges into the big 'I' then you are really smiling! \u2014George Harrison, The Beatles Anthology  And a bonus track, of course!!! We can Work It Out, just listen to it!  Hope it helps! ",

            "answer_text": "This subject is too much fun! But not so easy to answer because so few Beatles songs aren\u2019t highly rated. So we have 2 factors to consider: greatness and level of acclaim. So we\u2019re looking for the highest greatness to level of acclaim ratio (G/A). So I\u2019ll emphasize the \u201clesser known\u201d aspect, and stick to relatively \u201cdeep\u201d (inasmuch as Beatles songs can be) album tracks that also happen to be great. Here goes a few that come to mind as having the highest quality/acclaim ratio, without being too acclaimed. Interesting how John, Paul, and George all make appearances: \u201cI Call Your Name\u201d: One of several wonderful early Lennon songs with a catchy, yet quirky guitar riff. One of the few Beatles songs that actually fits the bill of being relatively obscure. \u201cNot a Second Time\u201d: Another unwittingly musically sophisticated early Lennon song that garnered some notice from classical music writers for its structure, which John just came up with naturally (John later wisecracking: \"To this day, I have no idea what [Aeolian cadences] are. They sound like exotic birds.\"). Not a Second Time - Wikipedia \u201cYou Won\u2019t See Me\u201d: One of Paul\u2019s catchiest pop tunes from Rubber Soul, which could well have been a big hit single had they not such a massive amount of hit singles material at the time. Maybe a little on the popular side, so I won\u2019t quibble with anyone who say\u2019s it\u2019s too acclaimed to fit in here. But it is so bloody great! \u201cIf I Needed Someone\u201d: A super-infectious piece of jangle-pop by George on Rubber Soul. Arguably his first truly great song, though the early \u201cDon\u2019t Bother Me\u201d was very solid as well. But not quite as great, to my ears. \u201cLong, Long, Long\u201d: A beautiful, very emotional ballad by George that ended side 3 of the White Album with a miked up rattling bottle that was sitting on an amp. By this point George was turning out lots of great material. \u201cHey Bulldog\u201d: A blistering Lennon rocker that got lost in the Yellow Submarine mire. \u201cIt\u2019s All Too Much\u201d: Another that fell through the cracks into the Yellow Submarine soundtrack; this one a rockin\u2019 George track with a rock attack somewhat like The Who (who the Beatles quite dug). And this one that\u2019s a bit on the well known side, but I think deserving of being one of their best known: \u201cI\u2019m Looking Through You\u201d: Another one of Paul\u2019s super-catchy mid period Rubber Soul tracks. With an out-take version that was also great, and some prefer. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh wow... once you get me going on this I can probably carry on going until the heat-death of the Universe, as I will talk about how one is my favorite, explain why at length, and then compare it to another, and explain why this, also, is my favorite... and go through most of their catalogue doing this, until I lost where I was and went back to the begining... But the ones that never fail to excite or move me: Lady Madonna... this is still so fresh and exciting it makes me want to run into walls screaming. The drive of the upright piano, the cool control of the vocal, the roll of the bass, the sweet vocal harmonic stab, the distorted guitar, the saxophone, and oh my god, the bit where the backing vocals sound like chickens...  Fool on the Hill... for a long time this was my favorite of all. It was something to cling to as a socially awkward kid whose parents also happened to be in a religious cult. Got out of cult, got to care less about being socially awkward. Penny Lane... sheer unalloyed joy, lyrics that evoke the dream of the perfect childhood none of us have, and that piccolo trumpet solo... Here Comes the Sun... years before John wrote 'imagine no religion', George wrote a song that was all religion, all faiths, all hope. Can you imagine what writing a song like that is like, let alone cutting a track that I can't imagine one making an improvement on? I'd be afraid to pick up the guitar again... \"Right... all downhill from here I think, musically speaking... going to take up sculpting now...\" But to be fair, at least three of those are only underated by fools (just saying), so I will try harder: Three underrated Beatles songs: Helterskelter (off The Beatles, aka The White Album)... \"hello world, here's a genre, go play with it, we're done...bye...\" Yeah, OK, Steppenwolf's album of Janaury '68 contained the words 'Heavy Metal', but the most famous band in the world (when this meant an order of magnitude or three more than it does now) dropping this track later that year was deeply influential and most peoples' first exposure to the style. I Want You (She's So Heavy) (off Abbey Road)... \"hi!... us again... we has a new genre...\" Once again, yes, prog rock was the thing crawling from the seas in '69 (as was heavy metal in '68 - and doesn't that fact alone make today's music scene seem so moribund?), but as before, The Beatles sucked up the influences around them and came up with this. Two of Us (off Let it Be)... I think the mix on the re-release Let it Be... Naked is a nice sonic refinement on what is a lovely, sweet song. Love, companionship, silliness, that moment when you realise that \"you and I have memories longer than the road that stretches out ahead\" (which I have always taken in the context of the song as meaning glimpses of things to come, rather than the past being longer than the future, which doesn't fit).

            "answer_text": "This is a tough one but I am going with three for a variety of reasons. You Can\u2019t Do That. Is it underrated? I think that no matter how much praise is showered on this song it isn\u2019t enough. It is an oddball; John playing lead, it is strangely threatening and the middle eight has a really unique chord structure. But you cannot deny the rhythmic rhythm guitar, the pleading vocal and the in your face rock and roll attitude. Fun to cover\u2026not easy to get right.In Spite of All the Danger. I don\u2019t care how old they were when they wrote it (15? Really?), that it was credited to Paul and George, or the \u201cborrowing\u201d from Elvis\u2019 \u201cTrying to Get to you\u201d this song is a real gem. Recorded in a makeshift studio straight to disc the acoustics and sonic reproduction leave a lot to be desired but the spark of a future legendary group are all here; self-composed, great harmonies and a catchy lead by George. Buddy Holly would have been proud to write or record this ditty and it sounds great in its purest form.Tie: You Like Me Too Much and I Me Mine. George had such an amazing ability to sum up what a collective feeling. With \u201cYou Like Me Too Much\u201d he perfectly (and painfully) echoes the thoughts of a selfish boyfriend (\u201cYou\u2019ll never leave me and you know it\u2019s true\u2026\u201d or \u201cYou haven\u2019t got the nerve to walk out and leave me lonely which is all that I deserve\u201d). How many introspective, honest boyfriends have come to that conclusion? In \u201cI Me Mine\u201d George captures the collective angst and dread of those around him \u201cAll through the day, I me mine\u2026Now they\u2019re frightened of leaving it, everyone\u2019s weaving it, coming on strong all the time\u2026\u201d He succinctly illustrates the sadness in the group, the fear of moving on and the fact that it is emerging in their songs. I love the waltz time and wish with both compositions that the group had spent more time helping George produce and develop them more completely.",

            "answer_text": "Ask Me Why    For No One     The Beatles, (and Lennon was always honest about this) recorded a lot of dribble. When interviewed about his songs and those which Lennon acknowledged were pretty much Paul's songs, Lennon was pretty honest and sometimes hard on himself. Lennon loved hard driving rock-a-billy in-your-face old school 50's music. Paul was a thinker, sometimes overly so. This likely drove Lennon crazy because Paul always wanted to experiment or re-do songs etc. Of Lennon's songs, I feel \"IN MY LIFE\" is so overlooked. We think highly of it; but for a guy like John Lennon who grew up angry and rough, that song is a rare look inside his heart. Also the song \"JULIA\" which he wrote about his absent mother. Lennon also speaks about \"NOWHERE MAN\" as the image he had of himself, alone...day after day.   Of Paul's songs, I think \"FOR NO ONE\" is absolutely beautiful, with amazing lyrics and such a sadness in it. Paul also lost his mother when he was very young. The song \"THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD\" has such pathos due to Paul's vocals. In my mind it is superior to \"YESTERDAY.\" But, my favorite under-rated, forgotten, dumped in the trashcan castoffs are ALL those early songs from the Beatles first, second, third albums plus all the singles released. Example:   P.S. I Love You  -  I still adore and sing along to that love songIf I Fell          -  Is that a Paul song or a Lennon song? No matter. A beautiful songAnd I Love Her -  Another play with words, instead of just \"I Love Her\"...they add \"AND I LOVE HER.\" MY favorite of all Beatles songs:  PENNY LANE  (it cheers me, reminds me of youth and is sung with such joy by Paul). One more...(or two):  THIS BOY;  GIRL,  YOU'VE GOT TO HIDE YOUR LOVE AWAY,  YES IT IS,  ASK ME WHY, IT'S ONLY LOVE, EVERY LITTLE THING. Lennon said so many of their songs were totally lazy and forgettable, and The White Album sure proves that. But I'll take a few \"filler\" songs like \"Why Don't We Do It In The Road\" because (unlike SO many dismal copycats) The Beatles grew, taught themselves, worked hard, organized their album covers their song placement per album...and we STILL want to sing along with \"HELP\" no matter how old that song is!

But in my opinion, it could easily take a spot in the top five songs on the album, which is really saying something. Good Night \u201cGood Night\u201d is my third favorite Ringo song after \u201cOctopus\u2019s Garden\u201d and \u201cWith A Little Help From My Friends\u201d. It has a magical feel to it, the instrumental being absolutely gorgeous. It\u2019s definitely not a huge hit or anything, but it is a good song. Anna (Go To Him) Although this one is a cover, I think the instrumental is rather incredible. It\u2019s just another one of those songs that make The Beatles unique. You Never Give Me Your Money This is, in my opinion, the most underrated song on \u201cAbbey Road\u201d. The chord progression on this one is incredible, and they connect it all beautifully. Cry Baby Cry It seems like no one knows this one, which is an actual crime. I once said that \u201cRubber Soul\u201d was John\u2019s best album, but after a song like this which seems to have been lost in the sands of time, I think I\u2019ve changed my mind. \u201cCry Baby Cry\u201d might not even be in the top ten best songs of this album, but it\u2019s definitely unforgettable.

            "answer_text": "1. I'm only sleeping. I think it's one of the most underrated songs by the beatles. The song is kind of depressing with calm John Lennon's voice and sweet guitar sounds, love bass too. One of my favourite songs in ''Revolver''. It is a slow song, reminds me of beatles song ''I'm so tired''.2. Golden slumbers. Such a wonderful song. As i recall it wasn't  written by the Beatles, it's a poem that Paul once found. He just changed some words and made a song, of course melody is what matters and it's so beautiful.3. Don't let me down. I don't care if it's about Yoko Ono. Love this song and it deserves much more attention. I guess it's the first John's written song where you can feel happy love, like real live. Sound is amazing. 4. She's leaving home. Dark and light at the same time. Melody seems so carefree, but lyrics are sad.5.Wait. I just really love the melody. It deserves more praise.6. If i fell. John Lennon's first ballad, what can i say, pretty good try.7.Michelle. I wouldn't say that it's a really special song, the sound feels really old even for the Beatles. But i just couldn't not write it here, this Paul's song, i listen to it at least 2 times a week. Not as good as yesterday and i lover her, but has it's own charm. ",

            "answer_text": "1)The best answer to this question is Strawberry Fields Forever.Lennon's dedication to his childhood.Has got so many different layers of music in it that it is just out of this world.The lyrics are as usual dreamy and reminiscent of a person being high... Typical marijuana influenced Lennon writing. 2) Another answer may be Love You To. This is a Harrison specialty and chance has got ton of sitar infused in it. Basically, it will make you feel like learning to play the sitar, it is played that well.It is fast paced, light hearted and a delight. It was released in the album Revolver, the best Beatles album in my opinion and hence was lost somewhere in that.Another great song is I'm Only Sleeping... On Revolver itself. It is a Lennon song. Hear the two of them together. They go with each other and hence I didn't liat it as a separate song. 3) This is my personal favorite among under rated songs. It is called The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill.This shows Lennon's satirical writing ability as its best.It is about a teenager they met in India during their stay in the ashram.This child would go to kill tigers riding on elephants along with his mom and pretend to be some brave guy while posing with them.The music is typical Lennon. And it has samples of Yoko Ono's wailing with it which lends a different dimension to it. 4) A under rated song from Sgt. Pepper's is She's Leaving Home. Its about a girl who left home leaving her parents in trauma only to be found a week later pregnant with the child of the vagabond she ran away with.This is one of McCartney's best written songs. It is a slow paced song. Reportedly, Brian Wilson cried when he heard it for the first time.The girl who got pregnant is a real incident which inspired Paul to write it. 5) Julia in The White Album is the song I chose to end this list. It is written by Lennon about his mother.It is basically Lennon doing a McCartney.What I mean is that it is just Lennon in the song along with his guitar. That is what McCartney is famous for and he did it in Yesterday and a few other iconic songs. Lastly, instead of listening to songs hear albums at a stretch and only then will you understand the greatness of Beatles!Start from Revolver and end with Abbey Road!!! :D ",

Come on. Their praises have been sung to the sky. There are a lot of other good answers, however. I agree that And Your Bird Can Sing and Yes It Is, for instance, tend to be overlooked. The most underrated Beatles song is one most people despise: Revolution 9. To anyone who really appreciates music, this is a fascinating track. It may sound like random noise to some, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s quite musically intelligent. I\u2019ve listened to it hundreds of times and hear different sounds and noise effects every time. Have you ever read the \u201clyrics?\u201d Pretty cool. They consist mostly of John and George reading bits of nonsense into the microphones, but somehow, they just work. Then there\u2019s the whole back story about how Charles Manson thought this song portrayed a black revolution, and if you listen, you can kind of sense why he thought that. Parts of the song sound like a war going on, with gunfire. All in all, an amazing track. It\u2019s not one I\u2019d choose for a desert island, but I never tire of it. ",

Questions like this are always tricky, since \u201cunderrated\u201d in a subjective thing \u2014 some of the songs I see listed in other answers I\u2019d never consider underrated. If underrated means \u201cnot well known,\u201d that\u2019s tough too. We are talking about The Beatles, after all. Lastly, I\u2019m sure this question is about to be merged with one or more very similar questions, at least one of which I answered but I don\u2019t exactly remember what I answered and am too lazy to go find it. But . . . Only a Northern Song. A George ditty, with veiled resentment about his status as third songwriter, publishing, etc. The other three and Mr. Martin didn\u2019t like it \u2014 it was originally supposed to be on Sgt. Pepper\u2019s \u2014 and were relieved when George offered up Within You Without You instead. But I\u2019ve always liked it \u2014 very psychedelic, honest yet detached. It\u2019s All Too Much. Another psychedelic gem from George, harder rocking than Only a Northern Song. Old Brown Shoe. It\u2019s George Harrison day! A fun number, not terribly well-known. Some great bass lines and a classic sharp, short solo. And a little homage to Ringo, perhaps, in the lyrics? \u2026\u2026.When I grow up, I\u2019ll be a singer / Wearing rings on every finger Doctor Robert. I hesitate to put this one in this category, because I\u2019m not sure is less well-known. But I\u2019ve always loved its ringing guitars and bouncy melody. And the thought that some anonymous dentist somewhere changed popular culture and music history forever. Another Girl. Hard to say anything on the Help! soundtrack is not well-known, but I just love this song. Paul\u2019s voice is so smooth . . . great melody, the twangy guitar so perfect. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are my top 10 I suppose. 10. The Fool On The Hill - Yes, I know this one isn\u2019t really underrated. I just know that, while a lot of people really love it (including yours truly), there are a fair amount of people who don\u2019t like it. To them I say: You\u2019re wrong and your opinion is invalid and incorrect (I don\u2019t actually care). 9. You Won\u2019t See Me - Funny enough, I\u2019ve seen many people list this track as one of the Beatles worst songs, or even their worst song, which is honestly ridiculous to me. It\u2019s not one of my all-time favorites, but the fact that some people say that deserves it a place on this list. Like some of the others on here, I just really love how this sounds. It\u2019s not exactly complex, but I still really like it. 8. I\u2019m Only Sleeping - It\u2019s weird. But it\u2019s great. I love how at every minute mark, the song abruptly stops, which always catches me off guard, but then picks up into that amazing \u201cKeeping an eye on the world coming by my window\u201d part. I also think the backwards guitar solo really works for this song, too. 7. Cry Baby Cry - I\u2019ve seen a lot of people recently bring up this song and mention that Beatles fans don\u2019t seem to mention this one, well, really at all. I personally think that\u2019s a big shame, because this song is fantastic. John really kills it on the vocals here, there are several points that sends shivers up my spine. I even love the \u201ccan you take me back\u201d little section, I don\u2019t know, I just think it fits really well with the rest of the song. 6. Two Of Us - This track, paired with \u201cAcross the Universe\u201d, makes for one of the best album openers of all time. Yeah, it\u2019s a bit repetitive. Yeah, the lyrics don\u2019t mean much of anything. But, damn it, this song just sounds so good! 5. For No One - While it may not be on the same level as \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d, this song is definitely one of Paul\u2019s highlights in this era of the band\u2019s career. The lyrics are so great, I still find it odd that James Paul McCartney, a man in his mid-20s, can write such meaningful and though provoking testaments. 4. No Reply - This is mainly up here for that bit in the middle. The rest of the song is great, don\u2019t get me wrong, and I love it, but that middle section\u2026 wow (the part that starts with \u201cIf I were you\u2026\u201d and ends with \u201cheard before when you gave me no reply\u201d) 3. Happiness Is A Warm Gun - A lot of people hate this song. Let me drill that into your head: A LOT OF PEOPLE HATE HAPPINESS IS A WARM GUN. This people clearly have no idea what good music is and should be bludgeoned with a mace (joke, obviously). 2. Hey Bulldog - Yes, I get that this track has been growing in popularity through the years, but I still don\u2019t think most people have realized just how truly magnificent this song is. This is one of John\u2019s best vocal performances, really showing that he can reach some of the gruff heights that Paul can reach. Speaking of Paul, the bass line on this song is one his best. I\u2019ve Just Seen A Face - This is one of my favorite songs of all time. Everything, from the guitar, to the lyrics, to Paul\u2019s vocals are just perfect. If I were hard pressed to choose a favorite Beatles song, there\u2019s a good chance I might say this one.",

            "answer_text": "Wow, this thread is old, looks like it goes back to Spring of 2012. Probably more than half of their songs have been mentioned. There are a couple I really concur with and a couple more that I think haven't been mentioned and need to be. The concurrences:Ask Me Why - beautiful harmoniesThis Boy - sameTell Me Why - It's one you often forget about, but the rhythm and the harmonies are really unusual and just as fun as they can be. Also, check out the Beach Boys' cover of it!You're Gonna Lose that Girl - One of the best call-and-response songs ever, with the harmonies in the responses. You NEED three people to sing this one.And I Love Her - Paul channeling ultimate Paul, with bongos keeping a beguine beat.Till There Was You - Paul covering The Music Man, and building a bridge to the older generation.Not yet mentioned (I think):It Won't Be Long - On their first album, The Beatles announce to the world that they are something new and different with the exciting chord change in the verse\u2014C to Ab (I always think of the first measure as Paul and that Ab as John), plus a cute pun.Do You Want to Know a Secret - Doo dah doo\u2014what more need be said?Run for Your Life - John letting us know he has a REALLY nasty side.I'm Only Sleeping - John letting us know he needs more time for sleep, in a beautifully evocative and unusual way.Doctor Robert - John explains the emerging pill scene.Flying - A beautiful instrumental which I believe is the only song credited to all four Beatles.Wild Honey Pie - From the White Album. Just ridiculous. And fun. Lastly, Real Love and Free As a Bird, finished by the other three a few years after John's death. I say the boys did a wonderful job, and I say it's real Beatles. ",

            "answer_text": "Revolution 1 Revolution is a well-known classic of the Beatles, but is just a sped-up, heavier version of Revolution 1, one of the many gems that made it to the White Album. Lennon recording Revolution 1, mic all the way down to him on the floor, coffees and cigarettes in reach, you can feel his peaceful yet stubborn attitude...  Have a listen:  An anti-war protest written by Lennon (\"If you want money for people with minds that hate, all I can tell you is brother you have to wait\"), the original recording is much much slower, and was re-recorded in the widely-known Revolution version because it felt too slow and too long for a single (Revolution is the B-side of Hey Jude). However, Revolution 1 is in my opinion much more richer, with vocal harmonies by McCartney and Harrison (shoobee-do-wa, paaaa-shoobe-do-wa), more vocal harmonies on Lennon's verse by the former, brass instruments that makes the song even better when you start noticing them, and a guitar riff that just hops in your headphones from left to right and right to left (swapping with the brasses, it's incredible). The chorus also features Lennon repeating the \"you know it's gonna beee\" line and if you dig Youtube, you can find a version of the live video they did for Revolution (fast version) where McCartney and Harrison dive in for the harmonies of the original version, it might not make much of a difference for you, but I get shivers down my spine whenever I watch it again (go to 1:39):  Last but not least, there is also take 20 circulating on the Internet, which is in my opinion the missing link between Revolution 1 and the experimental/avant-garde Revolution 9. It is pretty much Revolution 1 taking off into a massive fuzz filled with loops, more harmonies, a Beatles unison (listen for the high-pitched voices at 5:42), harmonicas, and different collages that just... WOW!   Of course this is one of the many, many gems the Beatles brought to us, make sure you explores all the answers on this fab question! ",

I think Beatles didn\u2019t produce any rubbish, which is quite exceptional. My most favorite modern composer is Mike Oldfield. Although I love Beatles, I would take Oldfield\u2019s records to a lonely island. But Oldfield has pieces which could be called rubbish. My absolutely favorite composer is Beethoven, but he has many things I consider to be rubbish. Beatles do not. Each album, each song is important. OK, I am not so excited about their earlier albums consisting mainly of cover versions, but their later works\u2026that\u2019s amazing. Greatest discography ever. But to answer the question, I think there are some not-so-widely-known songs which deserve attention. Day in the life, Lovely Rita, Sexy Sadie, Yer blues, Polythene Pam (and generally the ending sequence of Abbey Road, that\u2019s wonderful). I could enumerate a lot of others. However, I think that these songs are not really underrated, they are just not so well-known for people who are not Beatles fans. ",

Not mentioning the who-did-whats to keep it short: Savoy Truffle. Great, unique, lyrics and vocal, a driving beat, top-notch playing, the beefy Sounds Incorporated horns, all produced perfectly. I\u2019ll Be Back. Simply a pretty song with great chord changes and a heartfelt vocal. Don\u2019t Let Me down. Stripped down but still full sounding, impassioned vocals, superb piano solo. Bass gets expands as song goes on but stops short of being overdone. Baby You\u2019re A Rich Man. Slow but pace picks up during choruses. Pounding Bass, psychedelia goes perfectly with the lyrics. More great vocals of course. Cynical fun. Don\u2019t Bother me (I told you there was no order). Cool lyrics for that Beatles period, a great rocker with neat percussion touches. She\u2019s So Heavy. The vocals are great, the music is a bit of a departure (for the better) and the Beatles handle it perfect form. The long ending with the increasing white noise isn\u2019t my favorite but everything else makes up for it. There\u2019s more but when it comes to The Beatles, there\u2019s always more. ",

I\u2019m a sucker for harmonies, so one of my favorite underrated songs in If I Fell on A Hard Day\u2019s Night. John and Paul\u2019s harmonies are so beautifully done that it makes it one of my favorites from the early Beatles. Also from perfect lead or background harmonies alone, No Reply, I\u2019m a Loser, I\u2019m Happy Just to Dance with You, Wait, Michelle, and Nowhere Man are great to listen to. I\u2019m also a sucker for good drumming from Ringo. He can really play beautifully when needed. Some really underrated songs with Ringo\u2019s drumming are She Said She Said and Rain. His fills are perfectly done and make the songs so much better. A few others that I really like are all over the place. For the early Beatles, A really underrated track is P.S. I Love You, which I really recommend. Til There Was You, a Beatles cover of the song from The Music Man, is very special due to Paul\u2019s singing and George\u2019s solo. The Night Before from Help! is a great song too! Just off the top of my head, I can also think of And I Love Her, I\u2019ll Follow the Sun, For No One, Here, There, and Everywhere (already rated high, but not high enough), Think for Yourself, and so many more! That just the touring years, too, so the list is nearly endless. Hopefully you will enjoy some of these, because I\u2019m sure everyone else is recommending most of these. Enjoy! ",

I Love You\u2019 or \u2018I Should Have Known Better.\u2019 Lennon\u2019s narrator is trying to get a hold of his girlfriend, who\u2019s apparently not been faithful. There's something quaint about the story, as you can imagine the modern version: Lennon first tries her on his iPhone, then texts her, \"Cum on, luv, WTF?\" Then he just gives up. It's just wouldn't be the same. \u201cIt\u2019s Only Love,\u201d its structure and phrasing are amazing, particularly the way the monosyllabic lyrics in the verse line fall, one by one, out of Lennon\u2019s mouth: \u201cI | get | high | when | I | see | you | go | by \u2026 my-oh-my.\u201d What's also cool is the A-B-A-B rhyme scheme of the chorus (obviously, the A part is repeated, so it\u2019s not exact): \u201cIt\u2019s only love and that is all/why should I feel the way I do/It\u2019s only love and that is all/but it\u2019s so hard loving you.\u201d That's the thing about being an amazing yet self-critical songwriter: So much of what you deem crappy is brilliant to other people. \u201cWithin You Without You,\u201d Go buy some incense, burn a little and lay on your back on the floor and chill the hell out. Then close the shades and shut your eyes. Lastly, take a deep breath and count to 10. Picture a pond, water pitter-pattering softly on the shore. Then put this song on. If you\u2019re not totally feeling it about 30 seconds in, we can\u2019t help you. \u201c\u2018Her Majesty,\u201d Her Majesty' is one of the greatest 23-second-long songs of all time. It might be the only one, in fact. In the same way \u2018Maggie Mae\u2019 comes off as a happy little throwaway on \u2018Let It Be,\u2019 \u2018Her Majesty\u2019 appears and disappears so quickly the listener is left wanting more. Which is such a naughty way to end such a great album. \u201cBlue Jay Way,\u201d This is such an odd little song, but it\u2019s oh so right. Written by George Harrison, it\u2019s got a windy sort of melody that doesn\u2019t fit quite right with the chorus -- even though it does. to hear a modern take on this oft-forgotten classic, and if you like the original enough to spend 30 minutes listening, spin it 800 percent slower here. \u201cGlass Onion,\u201d Glass Onion it\u2019s strange in a good way, as it subtly pokes fun at Beatles songs like 'Strawberry Fields,' \u2018I Am the Walrus\u2019 and \u2018The Fool on the Hill.\u2019 It's kind of like when Paul jokingly sings \u2018She Loves You\u2019 at the end of \u2018All You Need Is Love.\u2019 Only the Beatles could write great songs that make fun of their own earlier great songs. \u201cSun King,\u201d Guitarists dig this song because it features a chord played by strumming all six strings completely \"open,\"without fingering any notes. In that sense, a 3-year-old messing around on dad's six-string can play it, though young strummers may struggle with the Spanish line near the end of the song. \u201cWhat Goes On,\u201d This song is basically a country-rock song, and arriving in 1966, it was ahead of the country-rock explosion. It is tongue-in-cheek and it was meant to be. \u201cTwo of Us,\u201d the duet between John Lennon and Paul McCartney you can almost hear the sorrow and strain in both of their voices. It\u2019s probably one of the last times the old mates did something beautiful together before the official breakup. Written by Paul McCartney about Paul\u2019s fondness for getting deliberately lost in the country with his future wife, Linda. Two of Us The Beatles Two of us riding nowhereSpending someone'sHard earned payTwo of us Sunday drivingNot arriving On our way back homeWe're on our way homeWe're on our way homeWe're going home Two of us sending postcardsWriting lettersOn my wallYou and me burning matchesLifting latches On our way back homeWe're on our way homeWe're on our way homeWe're going home You and I have memoriesLonger than the road that stretches out ahead Two of us wearing raincoatsStanding so lowIn the sunYou and me chasing paperGetting nowhere On our way back homeWe're on our way homeWe're on our way homeWe're going home Songwriters: John Lennon / Paul McCartney  ",

            "answer_text": "  Eleanor Rigby - This is the song that first endeared me to the Beatles. After deciding to conscientiously give The Beatles a chance and see what the fuss was all about, I picked up Revolver based on the CD art alone. It looked cool.The first track sounded exactly like what I thought The Beatles would sound like, so I was initially unimpressed. And then Eleanor Rigby started and I forgot to breathe for two minutes and seven seconds. I was literally breathless. I played the song over and over again for the rest of the day. I was shaken to my core, and I don't know if it was the song itself or how the song invited me to interpret it and find a personal connection. I saw all of life laid out before me -- all of the lonely people, waiting by windows and writing sermons to a god that doesn't exist, and as such is impotent to saving even the most devout. And in the end, we are all buried with only our name. We cease to exist and all that remains of our voice, our face, our dreams, our aspirations, our wants desires hopes experiences, the sum of our being, all that is left is our name on a rock.And that's how I came to love The Beatles.

            "answer_text": "Cry Baby Cry from The Beatles (1968)-If The Beatles had ever gotten around to doing a rock musical, just as The Who did with Tommy, then this song would have been a perfect ingredient. John\u2019s lyrics are amusing, and all the silly royalty references are reminiscent of the hilarious Alice in Wonderland parody in the video of Don\u2019t Come Around Here No More by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Honey Pie from The Beatles (1968)-Paul McCartney once said that if he had not gone on to achieve success in the world of Rock and Roll music, then he could have seen himself veering in the direction of being a Cabaret artist. This tune is perhaps a little sampler of what might otherwise have been but, thankfully, was not. I Don\u2019t Want to Spoil the Party from Beatles for Sale (1964)-This is a song that could have had several different arrangements just like Yesterday. On the one hand, the tune would sound quite good if performed with a ukulele, just like Something; on the other hand, the lyrics are quite suitable to have been used to create a chart hit in Country music. And guess what?! Rosanne Cash did just that, going all the way to #1 back in 1989. ",

            "answer_text": "It takes real genius to recognize the patterns within your own art, and parody it.  Thats one of the many reasons why I love this first song.  Michelle, it has a beautiful guitar rift, and parodies all silly Beatle love songs, by having Paul sing a silly love song that just, \"words that go together well.\"  \"Michelle my bell, These are words that go together well,My Michelle.\" Don't forget to look up the French, its a nice easter egg.  If you contextualize this song, its on Rubber song which along with Revolver are the transition from pop Beatles, to experimental Beatles, so it a prefect response to their early music.     The White Album debatably their most famous album along with Abbey Road, so it is hard to call anything off it unknown, but this song is often overlooked.  Honey Pie, another silly Beatles song, about a English prostitute who became a movie star in the USA. Its got some great lyrics. \"Honey Pie you are driving me crazy, I'm in love but I'm lazy,So won't you please come home?\"    The Word, also another gem of a song. The sentiment is so beautiful, but again its not a song that takes it so too seriously. It's something, I imagine dancing with my  wife to.  \"Say the word and you'll be free. Say the word and be like me.Its so fine, sunshine.Have you heard the word is love?\"   ",

            "answer_text": "And Your Bird Can Sing - from The Revolver. Groovy, upbeat guitar melody from George, which pairs well with the song\u2019s meditative lyrics. Honey Pie - from The White Album. A cheery mix of jazz and ragtime, the song is a nod to the music hall era. Throwback to the Beatles\u2019 throwback. Golden Slumber - from Abbey Road. This one is a bit context-specific. It starts with a lullaby that grows heavy with the addition of timpani and Paul\u2019s own voice evolving from a croon. The addition of timpani\u2019s to the initial piano is actually pretty emotional, especially since the song is featured towards the album\u2019s end, and that the album would be their last. It makes you appreciate how far the Beatles have come in their musical journey, and wonder maybe they were just trying to \u201cget back homeward\u201d at that point. I haven\u2019t listened to the Beatles in a while, to be honest, but I was scrolling through my music library for their albums to answer this question. Guess I\u2019m now back to playing them indefinitely\u2026 ;) ",

Listen closely. \u201cIt\u2019s Only A Northern Song,\u201d in my opinion, is the closest that the Beatles ever got to Zappa (loopy background effects, trumpets, organs). The whole arrangement is a glorious mess, and Harrison\u2019s vocals (in my opinion) were at the peak on this one. ",

            "answer_text": "The Ballad Of John and Yoko- I personally love this number. It is so sorely ignored in face of the great work that they did around the same time. Many people might even hate it because it spells in some way the end to The Beatles. But, boy, the music! The thumping drums, the great guitar work and those maudlin beats. Lennon's vocals are at their glorious, drunken best and Paul is behind the entire music so the song is an unwarranted Lennon-McCartney triumph. I Am Happy Just To Dance With You- Fantastic song, thrillingly fast, short and excellently scored. This is one of those early Harrison numbers that really hinted at great things coming along. Dear Prudence- Lennon really rocked this song. This was completely his baby- a wonderful misty melody scored with beautiful perceptiveness and technical finesse and his sneering voice is so so beautiful. Even the personal lines- addressed to Prudence Farrow- work wonders.  We Can Work It Out- Another great Lennon-McCartney collaboration, yet one in which John steals the show quite neatly enough. Nevertheless, Paul himself sounds so good, so you can almost imagine Lennon in extraordinary form. Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da- Yeah, it is a piece of nonsense but it is nonsense of the most delicious, melodious order when given in the hands of McCartney. Boy, his freaked out vocals sing out this jaunty ska number with such classy elegance that we now know why he was in top form as a chocolate boy singer of melodies. And yes, everyone else has a blast too even though they all hated it. ",

The very line of \"You know my name, look up the number\" is funny enough to make you interested in the song.     Also, a personal favorite of mine, \"Inner Light\" is almost always refreshing and enlightening. George used sitar and Indian classical music fusion in a number of tracks, but I feel the fusion has been done better justice in this song than the much talked about \"Within You Without You\". The link here is not the original version, it's the rendition played by Jeff Lynne and Anoushka Shankar in \"Concert for George\".    \"Do You Want to Know a Secret?\" is a short, sweet and melodious love song written by Lennon-McCartney for George to sing. It truly is a hidden gem within the Beatles catalog.    There are two versions of \"Ain't She Sweet\" in Beatles Anthology, and both are sweet and melodious. This is not a Beatles original song, but it's probably the most recognized version of the song right now.  I also agree with all other songs suggested by the other posters. ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with Justin Stone: 'Yes It Is,' is a very underrated song. Beautiful harmonies. 'If I Fell,' is also a great song. Simple harmonies, but very effective. 'This Boy (Ringo's Theme)' is one of my favorite all time songs. When John's voice goes up at the end of the bridge, it's strained, but in a good way (similar to 'Twist and Shout.')  One that I always felt didn't get the recognition it deserved was George's 'Savoy Truffle.' The horns and Fender Rhodes give it a very generational feel; 60's in the full effect.   'Rain,' is known song, but you'd think it would be more popular. I'm a sucker for harmonies (could you tell by my past comments) and I think they are top notch during the chorus of this song. Backwards played music, a great drum performance by Ringo, a beefed up bassline, and John's sweet delivery sends goosebumps up and down my arms.  ",

            "answer_text": "Obviously, any response to this question has to entail a lot of subjectivity. Here's a couple of picks, from my perspective, that aren't often given their due by casual listeners. \"Hey Bulldog\"  (1968; released on the Yellow Submarine soundtrack album, Jan. 1969)   \"Geoff Emerick, the Beatles' engineer, would subsequently claim this was the last song the band recorded that featured a team dynamic with enthusiasm from every member. He also praised the performance in his book Here, There, Everywhere, saying \"Paul's bass line was probably the most inventive of any he'd done since Pepper, and it was really well played. Harrison's solo was sparkling, too--one of the few times that he nailed it right away. His amp was turned up really loud, and he used one of his new fuzz boxes, which made his guitar absolutely scream.\" (Source: Wikipedia)    Additionally, I will offer a personal favorite-- from the pre-Ringo days (1961) in Hamburg. \"Ain't She Sweet\" -- pure R&R, full of energy; Lennon's lead vocals are a harbinger of what's to come.

Placing it directly after \"Helter Skelter\" on the White Album was an interesting move; the album's quietest, most spiritual song after its most electric and roaring. Truly an eclectic album. I also love \"Savoy Truffle,\" another underrated White Album song by George. It's cute.I'm a big fan of the much-maligned \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\" and especially \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer,\" too. I have a soft spot for quirky Paul ditties. I hope my suggestions help you for more related information visit Fakaza ",

Sure there were some covers but those covers are really well done. Songs like chains, Mr postman, and you really got a hold on me. I also loved the song words of love, doesn't matter to me if buddy Holly had already done it. The Beatles loved American rock and roll and they did lots of covers as tributes to these artist, nothing wrong with that. Misery what you're doing, all I've got to do, those are really great songs. I could go on but I won't. Just check out those earlier albums if you want less known stuff. A lot of people only listen to the Beatles later stuff which heralded in a more modern sound where as their earlier stuff was an homage to the rock and roll they had heard coming from America. It's still great especially if you like old time rock and roll. ",

I\u2019ll Follow the Sun: Very heartwarming and nicely done, not overly cloying or saccharine. Ob La Di Ob La Da: I don\u2019t care about people said this song being vapid or irritating, I love it and the lyrics are cute. Back in the USSR: Fun and catchy, in Paul style. By George: Here Comes the Sun: Nicely done and heartwarming, in George style. Something: Beautiful and touching, nice job George. Taxman: The lyrics are snappy. Within You Without You: Sultry and exotic, the best Indian style Beatles song. Piggies: Very cute song ",

Yer Blues, aptly a piece of fierce blues rock that might as well be written by an American blues/roots rocker and the Monkey Song (as I call it), a 3 minute tornado that shows us just how hard and how kewl the Beatles could rock. MelodicSun King & Because 'coz they are probably the best harmonies in addition to being two of the great melodies in the Beatles catalog. I'm just mesmerized by these songs.

Sexy Sadie - just sounds like the band had a fun time recording this (Yoko was there, so not sure). The call and response in this tune reminds me of The Beatles early hits. Hey Bulldog - been listening to the Beatles for 16 years and heard this song for the first time last year. It blew me away! Automatically became a favorite. True definition of underrated. Don't Let Me Down - was this a B side to Hey Jude or something? Hey Jude is one of maybe five Beatles songs total that I like more than DLMD, so what poor timing Lennon! (JK) ",

Nice to play along  Hey bull dog - feel this song gets overshadowed by similar sounding Lady Madonna  Only a northern song - very under appreciated . It's got a great video as well Don't pass me by - this is my favourite song sung by Ringo Real love - probably tops this list for me. Wish it gets as much recognition as its close cousin free as a bird.  I've tried covering songs from all their playing years. Compiling a list of underrated songs is very difficult considering we are talking about one of the best band on earth ",

            "answer_text": "The Inner Light. I find this to be one of George's best and yet isn't given much attention, perhaps because it's unlike most other Beatles songs and it was originally released as a b-side to Lady Madonna and not on an album. I particularly like the way the song was recorded and performed. I think it's George's most beautiful singing on a Beatles recording. Paul particularly liked the melody of this song. For No One. Certainly a well respected song, but still underrated in my opinion because it's not placed in the same regard as other McCartney songs such as Yesterday, though I find it as good. I think Paul was at his songwriting peak during Revolver, which I feel is a big part of why many consider it the Beatles best album. I think part of the reason this song is not covered as much as others is that it's very hard to match the Beatles version. Paul's vocal and the Alan Civil french horn solo add a huge amount to the original recording.  ",

            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t know about under rated as such but less well known and still mind blowing would be The Inner Light by George Harrison. Back in 1990, I had to buy this as a single the A side was Hello Goodbye, and the Inner Light was the afterthought. Of course the original came out in 1967, but having been born in 1968 understandably it took me some time to become aware of this gem. Things are not like they are today whereby I can share this ditty instantly and without costing you a penny. Back in 1990 I had to read about the said track and came across it by accident later in a Second Hand record store in Edinburgh. I suspect I even lacked the means with which to play it, as I didn\u2019t own a record player- everything I had was on tape cassette. The Inner Light I don\u2019t think even made it on to one of the Beatles Compilation albums The Blue Album from 1967 to 1970. So that is a bit of an insight into the world of the record buyer back in the day. It was more arduous and costly getting your \u201cfix\u201d, but you felt a greater sense of pay off when you got home with something truly great. In fact going by my search on Youtube it is still hard to get the version I have on vinyl. This seems to be close, but no vocal. Enjoy.  ",

            "answer_text": "Let's not forget the quiet Beatle, the late great George Harrison. His masterpiece, in my opinion, was one his Abbey Road writing contributions \"Here Comes the Sun\". The song was layered with strong emotion and novel experimental elements, such as the Moog synthesiser, which challenges me to listen to the song from multiple angles. The background of the song was also historically rich: he wrote the song to express his hopes for a better day when the band faced certain financial troubles and the possibility of breaking up. This song never gets stale and elevates my spirit in any scenario possible. Fellow peace & love advocates would agree with me. This is probably the most famous cover, by Crosby, Nash and Paul Simon.
