            "answer_text": "Because the government doesn't want to admit that the land they falsely occupy is not truly abandoned but it belongs to the Aboriginal people who were here before the so called native Americans (Mongolians). Those aborigines happen to be falsely labeled as African-Americans because in 1988 when Jesse Jackson ran for president he and a small group of 5 people or so, petitioned to have the Black population's classification changed to African-Americans. Aboriginal means, \"first, earliest, existing from the beginning,\" and Native means, \"born in a particular place.\" The Webster's Dictionary of 1828 defined an American as, \"originally applied to the aboriginals, or copper-colored races, found here by the Europeans.\" The popular American love novels, Copper Romance Magazine of the 1950s was known for what visibly appears to be African-American beauties who graced each and every cover. I wish I could attach a few examples here but for some reason I am unable to. If the so called African-Americans of today are not the aboriginal people many of us know to be then why was it accepted to refer to Black women as copper-toned and not anyone else? Virginia colonial law has also been known in the past to categorize American Indians and African indentured servants and prisoners of war (penal slaves) into one category. If there wasn't a commonality then why were they grouped into one category which became the object of scorn? Walter Plecker also had his hands in the effort to deny American Indians from their birthrights. Plecker was an advocate for racial purity and believed in the myth of white supremacy (He was an active leader of the racist organization, Anglo-Saxon Clubs of America. Unfortunately, he was also the first registrar of Virginia's Bureau of Vital Statistics, serving from 1912 to 1946.) Any visible darkness was automatically, wrongfully classified because at one time people were not allowed to conduct and parts of the census themselves, but clerks did it for them. This act was known as paper genocide. He drafted and lobbied for the passage of the Racial Integrity Act of 1924 by the Virginia legislature; it institutionalized the one-drop rule and spread to other states. ",

            "answer_text": "I can't speak for the whole of \u201cblacks\u201d but I use \u201cAfrican American\u201d to signify that I am a descendant of African americans(People born in modern Africa that permenantly willingly and non-willingly settled in America) Although I am technically a Texan because all of my family have lived in East Texas since before the end of slavery. I have recent ancestors from native america and Europe but my predominant recorded ancestry traces back to American slaves and free people of color. I could care less about the terms that were given to us by white people but AA just signifies I am not ashamed of my predominant Ancestry and I think the term itself tells a story. Although it should be mentioned that most of these terms were given to us. I identify as a dark skinned native Texas for the most part. I don't mind being called black but I rarely go with that either because I'm not literally the color black and most of my family has dark brown to pale white skin. Black is a \u201cracial\u201d term based on efforts to maintain white supremacy and to preserve the white identity. Being apart of the African diaspora connects all of us with recent African ancestry regardless of skin color and precieved racial notions. If I had a choice I'd just go by native Texan since my family can be traced back to Mexican Texas and have owned land here since the late 1800s. In America, it comes down to if you're white or non-white. Since I don't believe in racial classifications I try to avoid these type of terms all together. ",
