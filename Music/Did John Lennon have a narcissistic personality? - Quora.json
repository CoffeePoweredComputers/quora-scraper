            "answer_text": "In general I would say no but of course with many very successful people they do check off some of the boxes of what are the traits associated with a narcissistic personality. So I honestly would say that he was not a narcissist but at times he did display some narcissistic tendencies if that make sense to you. I think it will make more sense if I show you the traits of someone with a narcissistic personalty. Narcissistic Traits A pervasive pattern of grandiosity (in fantasy or behavior), need for admiration, and lack of empathy, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following: A pervasive pattern of grandiosity (in fantasy or behavior), need for admiration, and lack of empathy, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following: Lacks empathy: is unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of othersHas a grandiose sense of self-importance (e.g., exaggerates achievements and talents, expects to be recognized as superior without commensurate achievements)Has a sense of entitlement, i.e., unreasonable expectations of especially favorable treatment or automatic compliance with his or her expectationsIs interpersonally exploitative, i.e., takes advantage of others to achieve his or her own endsIs often envious of others or believes others are envious of him or herRequires excessive admirationShows arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudesBelieves that he or she is \"special\" and unique and can only be understood by, or should associate with, other special or high-status people (or institutions)Is preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal loveSo if you read this list you can see a few things that did relate to John at times and that is the key I think. At Times, he had his moments maybe but generally most of these traits really did not apply on a daily basis. Even the things where you could say yeah I can see that as how he acted I would say he didn\u2019t go overboard with that behavior and carry it to extremes. As I said most very successful people have at least some of these traits but not to the degree that I would call them a straight up narcissist. ",
