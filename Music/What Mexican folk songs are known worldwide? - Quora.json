            "answer_text": "There are different definitions of \"folk song\", but basically I'll treat that to mean \"old, traditional, origin so far in the past that no one can say for sure\" and exclude more modern commercial songs, like B\u00e9same mucho (which anyways, despite being written by a Mexican, is actually in a Cuban musical style, not a Mexican one). I nominate La Bamba. La Bamba (song) - WikipediaLa Bamba is a folk song, a traditional son jarocho from the state of Veracruz. Traditional arrangements usually feature one or two Veracruz harps accompanied by Veracruz relatives of guitars, like the jarana and requinto. It\u2019s believed the first recording of the song was in 1908, although the song\u2019s origins (who wrote it? when?) are lost in time. As well as being famous in Veracruz and throughout Mexico, La Bamba was recorded in the US several times already before Mexican-US rocker Ritchie Valens made it even more famous with his 1958 rock and roll version. (And it experienced a resurgence when a film based on Valens\u2019s life was released in 1987, named after the song.) Nowadays people from many parts of the world will not only recognize the tune but maybe even be able to sing some of the lyrics, regardless of whether they speak Spanish or not, and perhaps without even knowing it\u2019s a traditional folk song from Veracruz, Mexico. Online searches will reveal performances by artists from many countries.  Youtube video: A world record number of dancers in traditional Veracruz dress dancing to La Bamba, performed in Xalapa, the capital of the state of Veracruz.(BTW Xalapa, previously spelt Jalapa, is the place jalape\u00f1o chili peppers are named after.)
