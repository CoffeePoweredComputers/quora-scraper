            "answer_text": "No more than it is rude to see things in the company of a blind person, or to walk when with someone who uses a wheelchair. It is, however, rude to listen to music rather than to the person who is deaf. Believe it or not, deaf people know that there is such a thing as sound, and that most of us pay attention to it. Some of it is survival (the bus rumbling down the street), and some, like music, we enjoy. If you persist in narrating the music to the deaf person, they may be annoyed. And if you are listening through earbuds, it\u2019s no more rude than doing that with a person who can hear, but can\u2019t hear what you are listening to. ",

            "answer_text": "People walk around with earphones and white plastic bits stuck in their ears - everywhere - all times - all hours. I find it all worrying as our brains, ears and nerves can only take so much before it becomes intolerable and these people are unaware of potential damages. I warn my son over and over again he does not take heed. Whether deliberate or thoughtless behaviour in these people - its best to ignore. Maybe rude or not - just thoughtless. I still love music and can recall many score, melodies and tunes many years on after losing bulk of my residual hearing. I respect others in their choices whether I like it or not. Best to disregard any tactless behaviour in others for your own peace of mind. ",
