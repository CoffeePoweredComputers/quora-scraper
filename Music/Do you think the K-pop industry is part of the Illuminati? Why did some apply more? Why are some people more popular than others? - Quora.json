            "answer_text": "Some groups are more popular than others because they come from a big 3 company (SM, JYP, and YG). These companies are well respected because they have a good record of putting out popular groups. Naturally, people are going to pay attention more to groups that debut from any of these agencies. Also, SM, YG, and JYP have enough money to properly advertise and promote their groups. A smaller agency obviously isn\u2019t going to have enough money to do these things. Of course, there are exceptions like BTS for example, but other than them, there aren\u2019t any other groups (that I know of) that share the same popularity as TWICE or EXO but come from a minor company. Actually, I suppose Wanna One is very popular, but they are still different because they come from a survival show (Produce 48), which is produced by M-Net. M-Net isn\u2019t exactly but an agency, but a lot of groups promote on their stages. Also, Wanna One has a short term contract. They are set to disband at the end of this year. In summary, if your group does not come from a big 3 agency, or if it\u2019s not from Produce 48, it\u2019ll be tougher to receive recognition. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. Way too many witchy references and hand symbols. If you notice whenever these groups perform at their concerts and in music videos it all seems VERY ritual like. Like almost casting a spell on the fans in the audience. I feel very sorry for the artist a part of these industries because they entered blindly into these situations and are basically trapped for life. Just take a look at some of their insta accounts etc. The signs are EVERYWHERE that something very sinister is going on.. ",

The reason that some groups are more popular than other groups is because different groups appeal to different types of audiences. For example, BTS appealed to people based on their music. Just because some groups make it, it doesn\u2019t mean that others don\u2019t train just as hard, they just don\u2019t get recognized as much. ",
