            "answer_text": "Keeping in mind the fronts do from 60% (your rear engined Porsches) to 80% of the work on a typical FWD econobox under hard braking, and are much more important than the rears in stopping distances with much, much more heat to shed: Number one is better heat rejection, less chance of brake pad fade and (brakes gradually feel weaker and weaker and can eventually stop working but they recover fairly quickly)/or boiling the fluid (little to no warning, pedal to the floor, total loss of brakes) due to heat. Disks have tons of surface area exposed to the world with vanes pulling air through the middle and the vented center doubling surface area over the non vented that are sometimes used on the rear. Once overheated, disks recover much quicker than drums due to surface area and having the pads/calipers exposed to fresh air and not isolated and insulated inside of the hot drums. Wet performance, disks still work somewhat when wet and will dry nearly instantly with use while drums can lose almost all power and can take many seconds to work again. ABS/modulation, disks typically modulate better and give better pedal feel and feel more linear than drums. This is in part because the disk calipers are more rigid and the fluid \u201crod\u201d has a near direct connection from the pedal/master to the caliper/piston/pad. The pads sit just millimeters from the disks when not in use and coupled with no pivot points and far less flex and fewer parts to wear and cause more slop due to tolerance stack up over time, disks feel more connected, have less pedal travel, and change less over time. Modulation/anti-lock suitability, drum brakes can and have been used on drums, it\u2019s more effective on disks. Disks have much, much better grab and release characteristics making them better for ABS use and for good drivers and brake modulation. Disks bite quicker and release quicker, \u201cobeying\u201d the driver or computer/pump better. I\u2019m mostly talking fractions of a second differences but it\u2019s noticeable on the track to the driver that\u2019s trying to balance the tire at the edge of locking up without locking and especially to a computer that\u2019s pulsing the brakes and checking operation via wheel speed sensors very accurately many times per second. The driver can stop the non abs car quicker and the computer can be more aggressive during a panic stop with disks. Unsprung weight, disks are usually lighter and brakes fall into the unsprung weight category. Less unsprung weight allows the suspension to work better, the tire will follow the road better without losing contact with the road when hitting bumps. The way it feels to the driver is the car does not skip over bumps when cornering as the tires momentarily lose traction over a bump. Generally but not always, the car feels less harsh to the driver over sharp bumps. Just going from my stock single piston iron caliper brakes to larger disks and aluminum 4 piston calipers with a 7lb reduction per corner, the difference was very noticeable and I wasn\u2019t looking for any change in cornering over bumps or unsprung weight changes. Serviceability, discs are far easier to replace pads/shoes and have no springs and pins to worry about. Also less friction material used in disk pads vs brake shoes. As disk pads wear, the system only has to make up for the direct pad wear, and no mechanism is required to compensate for wear other than the brake fluid and it\u2019s reservoir. The pistons come out in a 1:1 ratio with pad wear and the fluid in the reservoir gets lower with pads wear and the level will go back up again with new pads. Most drums have an adjustment mechanism to compensate for wear since shoe wear produces much more movement at the piston. Some are automatic, turning a \u201cstar\u201d or a screw/ratchet type mechanism each time you hit the brakes in reverse. And some you have to turn manually once in a while. One thing rarely mentioned is for the same drum/disk diameter, drums are usually the more powerful brake. Drums are usually cheaper. They are self energizing in one direction which is why they usually work well when going forward but not so much in reverse. Both drums and disks can be cable operated but hydraulic is so superior for many reasons, with consistency between brakes being toward the top of the list when there are four on a system. Drums tend to be less consistent in braking power especially as they age and adjustments and wear and contamination become a factor. Couple that with with cables and it\u2019s a nightmare. An older VW Bug is one of the scariest cars I\u2019ve ever driven with its cable operated drums and I have a 600rwhp Buick GN as a fun/sometimes daily driver. A small drum inside a disk for emergency brake service is perfect. You have a small strong brake (except if the car wants to roll backwards) that\u2019s operated by a cable, separate from the main hydraulic system in case there\u2019s a failure and you have the service brakes that are all disk with it\u2019s advantages. I\u2019ve found that parking/emergency brakes like this usually lack the power they are capable of. The shoes never get broken in and every brake needs to be broken in. The parking brake is only applied with the car sitting still so there\u2019s no wear, no \u201cuse\u201d. Pulling one of these brakes lightly for a few seconds at a time while driving will usually have a lot more power after just a couple applications and will require less pull or push or the pedal or lever to hold the car still. Obviously you don\u2019t want to lock a wheel and you don\u2019t want to engage one of these brakes very often or for more than a few seconds when moving because they have very little wear material on the shoes and they are very small and will overheat easily. There are other more rare advantages of disks such as the use of exotic pad and rotor materials for racing and very high end street cars. I\u2019m not sure a drum can be made and be safe for use out of carbon or any of the ceramic type materials that the more exotic disc systems are made of. I forgot (typing this from my phone and I have zero short term memory) to mention that the old \u201cthe front brakes do 70, 80, 90% or whatever percent of the braking varies wildly these days depending on the car and on the conditions. Weight distribution and suspension design, both type and compliance affect weight on each end of the car though a car that\u2019s softly sprung and under damped with lots of nose dive under braking will not change the dynamic weight distribution much over one that\u2019s stiff with near zero dive and lift. Same with cornering, leaning in the corners mostly negatively affects the suspension geometry and it\u2019s ability to keep the tire flat on the road with one side at full droop and one at near full compression than outright traction. Some cars as far back as the \u201880s like the 944 were designed where the back would not lift under hard braking. It felt like it actually squatted to match the front dive which was minimal. Many today will go more negative on the camber as the body rolls in hard corners, keeping the tires flat on the road in hard corners despite body roll. Honda/Acura are some of the best ordinary street cars I\u2019ve ever had on the track as far as suspension design and don\u2019t need much in the way of correction other than more spring and damping and this is coming from someone who owns a live axle car that\u2019s has a horrible front suspension geometry (not a bad design though). On the flip side, a car that\u2019s stiffer with less roll and dive will be much more fun and quicker around a track partially because of better composite transitioning from different loads or combinations like cornering right then left abs transitioning to braking, braking to acceleration, whatever. And planning for body roll in your timing, not to mention roll and dive make it feel like you\u2019re cornering and stopping much harder than you actually are. And more composed cars don\u2019t do \u201cweird\u201d stuff at high speeds as much. Got way carried away again, braking distribution varies a lot and the old percentages are true but mostly under maximum braking. Many systems with electronic prop valves will have the rears doing half or more of the braking under light braking to make the car feel a little more secure and less \u201cdarty\u201d or unstable and ramp up the fronts with hard braking.

            "answer_text": "One sentence summary: It\u2019s cost effective as front ABS brakes are now the norm. Okay, I\u2019m afraid I lack some experience in this area. However, I know a lot of people that are much smarter car wise than I. I was actually looking at upgrading my rear drums to discs using a factory kit. Here are their responses to my questions. Q: I\u2019m debating switching my back drums for discs (after a car accident caused by ineffective braking technique). Is there a benefit? A: Not really. Discs work great, but when they\u2019re on the front wheels they\u2019re already making most of your stopping power. Adding rear discs or even making your front ones bigger won\u2019t have much of an effect. Not to mention the benefits of rear drums. They don\u2019t get wet in their sealed drum. They don\u2019t need as much regular service. They don\u2019t get dirty in their sealed drum. They\u2019re cheaper to fix. Q: Wait, why do my discs take most of the force again? A: They\u2019re in front. When trying to stop a moving car, most of the force is transferred to the front wheels. Having discs there makings sense, and after the development of Anti-lock Brakes (ABS), they work even better. Q: Okay, but the rear wheels are still helping the car stop. Having discs there would help them stop more, and give ABS a more powerful brake to work with, right? A: Yes, you would have more braking power. In your rear wheels. If you\u2019re stopping really hard, they have much less force on them and do less good. It\u2019d be better to get super grippy tires to improve traction than to upgrade the brakes. ABS prevents the worst of lock-up, so having bigger brakes isn\u2019t such a big deal. Okay, one note from me as a Chemistry nut. The overwhelming majority of car brakes use a type of fluid (most are now glycol-ether based, but higher end systems can use mineral oil) to convey hydraulic force. This fluid can boil under heavy braking in both disk and drum brakes, leading to \u2018brake fade\u2019 or loss of effectiveness when stopping. Basically, the brake can\u2019t press as hard as designed and won\u2019t work as planned. Drums are historically noted for having higher internal temperatures, as they are sealed pretty well. This makes them less likely to suffer from many other issues, but makes brake fade worse. In rear brakes, this is less of a problem as they handle less braking power. In front brakes however, this is bigger problem as ABS requires powerful braking force. If you go out and check your front (hopefully discs in a new car) brakes, you\u2019ll probably notice a slot in the middle of the metal rotor with little columns bridging the gap. These are called \u2018ventilated disc brakes\u2019 and they dissipate heat very well when compared to a drum. In upgraded brakes like on race cars or garage builds, you would also most likely notice holes drilled through the brake and slots engraved in the shiny surface. These all reduce brake fade and keep the disc brake effective. That's why, if you need a way to stop the front of the car, you put discs there. I digress. The point is, cars brake on their front wheels. Even cars with front/rear discs have smaller discs on the back than on front. Cars that have rear drums are often cheaper, since drum brakes are cheaper in some respects. Luxury models have more discs for more responsive braking, but they\u2019re more complex and require more work to maintain. P.S. I am possibly wrong about costs, but my car is kinda cheap in all categories so it might just be me. Looks like I\u2019d spend $150 in parts to fix either axle\u2019s brakes. However, a front caliper will cost about $100, while the rear wheel cylinder is $30. ",
