            "answer_text": "Elvis and a pretty rudimentary grasp of how to play the guitar- he plays basic, driving acoustic rhythm guitar on some of his earliest recordings but left anything more complex to other players. Live, in the early part of his career he used an acoustic guitar more as a prop than as an actual instrument, but would occasionally bash out a chord or two. So yes, at the most basic level he could play the guitar. Would you have wanted to see his one man acoustic troubadour show, just Elvis and his guitar? Probably not. ",

            "answer_text": "He played guitar quite adequately. I don\u2019t think he was ever likely to win awards for his playing, but he was perfectly capable of playing rhythm, and there\u2019s a story of the Beatles meeting him and jamming with Elvis on bass. However, like many entertainers, he used a guitar as a prop, more than an instrument. Having a cool looking guitar with your name down the neck is a pretty good gimmick.  ",

But, you can see in footage that he is fully capable of playing all the common \u201ccowboy\u201d chords on his Martin. In the comeback special, he plays a Gibson Jumbo acoustic and, I think, a Super 400 electric. After that, he mostly left it to the pros. In the movies, he is just faking it, and lip syncing to tape playback, but that was just the technique at the time. ",

I learnt that Elvis was am average guitar player who picked up a little Blues picking from the musicianss who worked with him.   It is not common knowledge but Scotty Moore (Elvis\u2019s first guitar player) was a really good blues guitarist, who entertained fellow sailors when in the Navy.   Elvis played piano much better than guitar but you don't see him play it much, he had one at Graceland that he always played. And played it in his very last concert singing Unchained Melody around May or June, 1977.  ",

Arguably he wasn't the greatest player but he could play the guitar. His genius was in the expression of his music and the guitar would be with him throughout his school years and on stage of course.

There is a concert in 1968 where Elvis takes the electric guitar from his lead guitar player and then plays lead and rhythm on several songs, quite tasteful. However, when your main gig is being a singer the musician skills come second. Actually he could play the piano quite well and used to entertain people at Graceland playing the piano and singing religious hymns. He recorded a couple albums of religious songs as well. ",
