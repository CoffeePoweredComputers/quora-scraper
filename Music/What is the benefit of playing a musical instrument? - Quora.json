            "answer_text": "Once, there was a shy, introvert child who used to be the most silent person in the world. He would trust no one except his parents. As a 6 year old, it was very unusual that he rarely talked or played with the children of his age. He used to cry in the school thinking that his parents have left him and are never coming back. This affected his studies and mind as well. But, he always liked one thing, and that was Music. His father always had a dream of learning to play a musical instrument. So he introduced the child to Tabla. The child was fascinated by the instrument. He played it with utmost dedication and passion. And with that, he was able to overcome his shyness. He experienced the world with a new vision and it was his Tabla. He became disciplined, matured and responsible. With each Riyaz, he not only overcame the difficult bols, but also ovecame his lacunas and overconfidence. Playing a musical instrument is one of those rare pleasures that can be compared to the peace we can feel, when we let our soul flow freely through our body and out to across to the free flowing chords of the musical piece. The happiness and calmness that we recieve is truly beautiful. Our brain, body and every inch of the soul is at peace. With time, it becomes our immense source of happiness. Music is nature's healer. It can heal the worst wounds and melt the hardest heart. And learning to make music is seen as an achievement. With your creativity, you can touch millions of people's heart or you can simply bring a smile on the face of your loved ones sitting beside a bonfire with your guitar. Now, coming to facts, your music can be your brain booster. It gives you a chance to stand out. It will make you smarter, more socially pleasant, will improve your memory and so on. You can even google it for more scientific facts. But the truth is learning to play a musical instrument or learning to create music (as I say it), will be your source of estacy. And it is rare for a person to be gifted with the knowledge of music. So, sieze that opportunity, learn a musical instrument. You may never know, with your music, you might change someone's life or inspire them to make music as their own way to seek happiness. ;) Pardon my mistakes, if any. Thanks for reading. :) ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, there are no genuine benefits of playing an instrument, at least not in the way people like to pretend there are. For me, I get the following benefits: 1- Playing music is more fun than watching TV, browsing social media, cooking, stamp collecting, or stabbing my small toe with a pencil. 2- It keeps me from being bored. 3- I feel good when I create something I actually like. Reid Stephan said you have to make 1,000 pieces of music to get to this point, and I can say this reflects my experience. Points 1, 2, and 3 shows the overall long-term goal of making music. There is no sane reason to put in the years and hours that it takes to make something you enjoy playing. Music is, for the first 10 years, a hobby. Realistically, you aren\u2019t ever going to become a professional, you aren\u2019t going to become a YouTube sensation, you aren\u2019t going to have your music played at festivals. You may get into a bar band and play covers for a little bit of scratch money, or you will just find considerable joy playing music in your bedroom. You may find joy learning about music, music history, discovering new music, and learning some theory. You aren\u2019t going to find a wife / husband, though you will meet many interesting people along the way. You aren\u2019t going to become a great mathematician, programmer, carpenter, or Rubic\u2019s Cube solver. You aren\u2019t going to get any benefit aside from playing music, and you only do that because you feel like less of a person when you aren\u2019t playing music. ",
