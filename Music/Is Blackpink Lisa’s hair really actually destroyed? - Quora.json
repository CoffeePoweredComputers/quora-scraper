            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a little unhealthy imo but not destroyed if she keeps dying it maybe it will be. I think Lisa actually talked about this once she said the other members hair are more healthier than hers. She also said something like \u201cmy hair isn\u2019t that unhealthy it is healthy a little but I still need to use special hair wash because of the dye and bleach.\u201d I was shocked because I\u2019m every MV her hair changes and I was so confused when I first got into BP I was like how can her hair stay healthy?? I think she\u2019s taking a little break from dying it now and is treating it more carefully but it does seem a little unhealthy still. Also her hair is dyed by YG stylists I think and they will probably put oil or something on her hair to help it anyway. Members who dyes their hair the most ranking: LisaRos\u00e8JisooJennieLisa is all for hair dye and changing her hair, my favourite hair of hers is probably in PWF the blonde one with the little bit of orange in it. Ros\u00e8 would do it but not as often her hair looks healthier than Lisa\u2019s. She has been Pinks\u00e8, Browns\u00e8, Reds\u00e8, Blondes\u00e8/Orangs\u00e8 I like all of her hair colours can\u2019t choose she looks amazing in every MV. Jisoo normally sticks to black however in PWF she had dyed her hair to blackish redish which I thought was nice and I liked it. However I loved her purple faded hair in stay it\u2019s my favourite. Jennie she has never fully dyed her hair a colour she sticks with more brown or brown with highlights. I think even in her audition video she had black hair with a silver streak? Since she dorks have a lot of different hair colours my favourite is probably in PWF with her brown hair and kinda ash grey/blondeish highlights. All of their hair looks healthy but Jennie\u2019s and Jisoo\u2019s looks the most healthy (Jensoo feels). And Ros\u00e8 and Lisa look like they have have healthy hair but doesn\u2019t look as healthy as Jisoo and Jennie however Ros\u00e8\u2019s does look healthier than Lisa\u2019s hair. (Chaelisa feels). Idk why I\u2019m saying Jensoo and Chaelisa when I ship Chaennie. ",

            "answer_text": "No, not yet. It is clearly quite unhealthy and is starting to have more fallout but nothing too serious. I think she should stop constantly bleaching it as she looks great in her natural hair color. YG is obviously making her dye her hair a lot as she has a different hairstyle in almost every MV, which can cause damaged root\u2019s and severe fallout. I hope Lisa and YG both realize if she does not stop constantly dying and bleaching her hair, it will be ruined.  ",
