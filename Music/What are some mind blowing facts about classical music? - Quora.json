            "answer_text": "\u201cClassical music\u201d as a term originated in the 19th century by English and German scholars to glorify the \u201cgreat music\u201d of composers that were considered to represent the best that Europe had to offer; namely, Bach, Beethoven, Handel, Haydn, Mozart, and the like. It was only during the 19th century that true \u201cconcert music\u201d - what many people today call \u201cclassical music\u201d - appeared. Prior to that, much music in Europe was either for private entertainment, or church use. It was only during the 19th century that people started going to concerts to JUST listen to the music. Most composers before this weren\u2019t exactly as revered as during the 19th century. They were usually seen as glorified servants hired by patrons such as the nobility or clergy. Composers didn\u2019t write as often to express themselves. The 19th century saw the rise of the public concert and sheet music industry as a means for composers to access a paying public - thus the start of music as a commercial commodity. With this, more and more people got to listen to and play the musical works of the masters. While Bach could only make the people in the church or palace he was working in listen to his music, Beethoven could write symphonies that anyone able to pay for tickets could listen to. Opera composers could sell the sheet music for the arias they wrote to people who wanted to sing them at home. Thus, these composers became more and more respected by the public, and they could then write whatever they wanted. People would go to concerts just to listen to their music and nothing else. This is where \u201cclassical music\u201d truly originated - music that you went to just to listen to it, not as a means of background music while you\u2019re eating or socializing. The composers demanded full attention from audiences because they saw music as something sublime. That\u2019s where \u201cclassical music\u201d came from, if you\u2019re talking about the whole \u201cgenre\u201d of music rather than simply the 18th century movement during the time of Mozart or Haydn.

            "answer_text": "Classical music has a reputation for being very straight-edged and clean-cut, with images of men in wigs and floofy collars. Not quite. The Quartet for the End of Time, one of the greatest works in the classical music canon, was written by Olivier Messiaen while interned in a Nazi prison camp during WW2. The unusual instrumentation of a piano, clarinet, violin, and cello reflects the fact that there just happened to be a clarinetist, a violinist, and a cellist in the same camp. The work was premiered on a rainy day in 1941, and the performers were released afterwards with the help of a sympathetic guard who forged papers on their behalf with a potato. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatuor_pour_la_fin_du_temps ",
