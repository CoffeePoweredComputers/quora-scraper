            "answer_text": "This is a lot more complicated than the supplied chart would imply. Technology is much more available than it once was. With an $80 Samson Go mic, a cello, an opensource suite of software (hell, Audacity alone cuts the cheese) and a few minutes spent knocking on my neighbor\u2019s doors to request 30 minutes of silence, I can produce record-studio-quality tracks in my living room. If I want singing on it, I\u2019d make a phone call to a bored friend.

The real story here is about how technology liberated artists from the institutions that were bludgeoning them to death\u2026 but that\u2019s just from the perspective of a part-time musician. I\u2019m sure the world looks differently to people who make their money by selling musicians, rather than selling music. ",
