            "answer_text": "Vibrato and Tremolo may have a similar sound to the untrained ear, but ultimately are unrelated in their production. Vibrato occurs as an oscillation of frequency within the vocal folds, manifesting as a wide, natural, resonant vibration - similar to a wide sound wave. Vibrato is the result of healthy vocal technique, and I personally treat it as \u2018positive feedback\u2019 from your voice when this occurs in a natural fashion. You can only train yourself to limit vibrato once it has developed, you can not train your voice to produce vibrato - it is a result of healthy phonation. Vibrato is similar to how a guitar string produces sound. An \u201cE\u201d guitar string does not vibrate solely at the E frequency, instead, this pitch is the central frequency with the string vibrates, giving the illusion of an E note. If you were to supersize a guitar string to a mile long tuned to this central frequency, it\u2019s likely you would actually hear more than an E and would sound like a slow wave, similar to when you strum a loose elastic band.  Now, tremolo, or trillo, is a rapid change in pitch or even volume in some cases by way of manipulating the vocal chords in a muscular way, in essence interrupting the natural process of vibrato from a sustained oscillation in place of a repeated pitch shift along the cord. Along with effecting intonation and the overall richness of tone that vibrato would instead allow to develop, tremolo is damaging to the voice in a number of ways. Allows improper air flowCauses muscular strain from the pitch shiftTrains improper development in cord coordination and tone productionLearning how to sing with vibrato is a a result rather than a process. You cannot \u2018train\u2019 vibrato with an exercise, but effective exercises and training will result in vibrato. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer I get from the Catholic choir director I play for is that anything other than straight tone is \u201cvibrato\u201d, and she doesn\u2019t want it. The answer I get from the Voice Teacher/Therapist I have accompanied since the 70s is: Vibrato is the natural result of a properly produced sound. Tremolo is a very slow vibrato, the result of lack of support (quite frequent in old people who lack strong core muscles). A fast machine-gun type vibrato is the result of vocal tension. ",
