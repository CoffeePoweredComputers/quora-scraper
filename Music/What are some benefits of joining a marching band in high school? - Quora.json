            "answer_text": "There are countless benefits of joining a high school marching band, if you\u2019re up for the time commitment. You will become very close to pretty much everyone in the band (especially if you\u2019re like me who was quite anti-social before joining band). Band guarantees you probably 100+ new friends.The obvious one. Free football game admissions.Most dedicated seniors receive scholarships at the end of their 4 years in high school band.This sounds corny but pretty much all bands teach you valuable life lessons such as work ethic, the value of teamwork, and professionalism.Fitness. Staying in marching band almost guarantees you a healthy body given the aerobic exercises and the stress on drinking water. I personally do not exercise outside of band and I\u2019m 6\u2019 and 150 pounds. As long as you commit, you will stay in shape.Lastly, it teaches you musicianship. As much as marching bands are noisy and hype-gathering, you still gotta learn how to play your horn well. This can benefit you if you plan on joining a college band which can help you pay for college, or a military band, such as The President\u2019s Own, which is highly prestigious.So, yeah. Join marching band, only if you are up for the large time and effort commitment. If not, who knows. Maybe join orchestra instead. ",

There will be tons of fun stories and moments to look back at once you\u2019re finished with HS marching band. It will be sad once it\u2019s gone, BuT tHeRe\u2019S sTiLl DcI!!!!!!!! But seriously, consider making a scrapbook in your downtime. This is probably one of the biggest ones for me. Bands are usually pretty hype and loud and obnoxious\u2026 there\u2019s also a couple of after-game band parties. It\u2019s pretty e p i c.T H E F R I E N D S!!!!! You\u2019ll become friends with 100\u2013200 people. Maybe more or less depending on the size of your band, but you get my point. You\u2019ll always have people in your classes and to hang out with.COLLEGE! This one only applies if you actually pursue music in your future. Marching band may help you get into a certain college and maybe get a scholarship.Life virtues. Cheesy but true. You learn teamwork, how to make friends, be professional, etc.Fitness. You\u2019ll be super fit, and you won\u2019t have to go to the gym during the marching band season. Well, unless you\u2019re in the front ensemble/pit (SHOUT OUT TO MY FELLOW PITSERS OUT THERE!!! ESPECIALLY SYNTH/KEYBOARD).",
