            "answer_text": "Apple really went wrong with Apple music- and while iTunes was loved - Apple music is hated and inspires revulsion in many.  Some ways in which Apple went wrong with Apple music: (1) Too much dependance on the cloud - atleast thats the impression one gets from it\u2019s UX- and since here in India - one pays through one\u2019s nose for data - that\u2019s bad, bad, bad - for everyone outside USA. (2) It deleted user\u2019s non-itunes videos which I spent a considerable amount of time getting onto one\u2019s device. When I upgraded months back to the ios version supporting apple music- I realized it has deleted around 5 GB of videos from my apple iphone 6 plus. (3) Reports OR were they rumours that Apple Music would delete all MP3s not downloaded or bought through iTunes rankles and rattles many users - and makes them wonder about the fate of their music collections and their favourite songs. (3) Apple Music - right with it\u2019s start screen- communicates that it offers a limited \u201cfree trial\u201d while pushing users to sign-up and subscribe. It doesnt understand that credit card usage is not equally common accross the world. It doesnt understand what people outside the bay area want in terms of features and appearance - compared to the earlier itunes connected avatar - which was much better and which one (and many others in India) could really relate to. (4) It supports too narrow a set of use-cases and user-stories- see other points above - most people I know take one glance at it and hate it / dont use it- with itunes the case was opposite and even people with low end PCs would install & use itunes. Many would only use itunes even when they knew it was heating and slowing down their 8 year old computers- simply because they loved iTunes - the opposite is the case with Apple Music!

            "answer_text": "Apple should have just: Cloned Spotify, which is really a great service / app that people love.Made it economical for Apple users to use Apple Music \u2014 so that it\u2019s meaningfully cheaper vs. Spotify. This is Amazon\u2019s pricing strategy with Amazon Prime Video.Doing just those two things would have led to a much better outcome. ",
