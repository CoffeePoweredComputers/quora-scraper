            "answer_text": "\u201cWhy do people hate One Direction and Justin Bieber?\u201d I usually don\u2019t answer questions like this one because people tend to be hypersensitive about it. To begin, there\u2019s an old saying in Latin: De gustibus non est disputandum. It means that you can\u2019t argue with taste. What people like and dislike is personal. If you can figure out what you like about music from One Direction and Justin Bieber, you will also know a lot about what other people don\u2019t like about them. I thought Krishnabh Medhi\u2019s answer was pretty good, but here\u2019s a little more. A lot of work has been done to quantify music, especially measures like meter, pitch, timbre, and loudness. If you were to quantify these metrics, you should find that popular music is highly conventional and stable over long periods of time. Less formally, most people can sing popular music, albeit with varying degrees of success. Pitch transitions are an important part of that, which is why early music instruction emphasizes reproduction of patterns like Do-Mi-So. Pop music also has a homogeneous timbral palette. That\u2019s a bit technical, but you can easily look those terms up. What it means is that popular music tends to be simple and predictable. In turn, that means that you can write music mechanically. For example, check out: Algorithmic composition It\u2019s easier than it seems. For example, let\u2019s say you started out with a million rabbits, you made them all run, and you picked the fastest half. The statistical distribution of the faster rabbits won\u2019t look as random as the whole population did. If you do that again and again, the distribution of the remaining rabbits will look similar to the first time you did it, and of course the rabbits will be getting better and better. Music has gone through the same sort of process. That is, the music that our ancestors liked got copied. The music they didn\u2019t like, didn\u2019t. Eventually, you get music that is closer and closer to perfect in the sense that it reliably gets the same emotional reaction from the sort of person that likes that particular kind of music. In this context, \u201cperfect\u201d does not mean that you and I will like the same music. Our taste is personal and individual. When people say that music is \u2018popular\u2019 they mean that a lot of people like it, but it would not be less perfect if only one person did. By the way, your brain processes the emotional value of a note of music at the almost unbelievable speed of 250 microseconds. That\u2019s too fast to think about it. You either have the emotional reaction, or you don\u2019t. If you were to take a survey, and there are many informal surveys available online, you would find a recurring pattern. For example, over 70% of people like McDonald's french fries or Kraft mac & cheese. About 1 or 2 in 10 will say that it is their favorite. By that standard, the 4th movement of Beethoven's 9th symphony is about as good as Lady Gaga's Poker Face. The music a given person likes says a great deal about how close his or her ear is to a conventional sort of middle ground. The end of Beethoven's 9th is popular because it is conventional, loud, and slow, and because it has a simple, repetitive melody that people can hum or sing along with, one which Phillip Hale (1899) referred to as \"...the unspeakable cheapness of the chief tune...\" The bottom line is that you shouldn\u2019t spend too much time thinking about what music other people like. The only thing that matters is whether you like it. As I said at the beginning, if you can figure out what you like about a particular song, you also know a lot about what other people don\u2019t like about it. In the case of Beethoven\u2019s 9th symphony, someone who doesn\u2019t like it might describe it as conventional, predictable, and repetitive. That is, if you like it and they don\u2019t, there\u2019s a good chance that that\u2019s for exactly the same reasons. Weird, huh? That\u2019s a lot to think about, I know, but I hope you will think about it, at least a little. If there\u2019s one thing I hope you\u2019ll take away from it, it is just this: Music is good because you like it, not the other way around. A lot of people make themselves miserable trying to like music that other people say is \u2018good,\u2019 or \u2018better.\u2019 Listen to music you like, but remember to stay open to possibility. Music is amazing. It\u2019s one of our very best things. ",

            "answer_text": "Jealousy and group mentality are two words that come up while thinking of that. Don't think Justin Bieber and One Direction were the first hated bands, just with the internet people can vocalize their hatred louder than ever. Also hating boy bands and or other attractive artists is more of a teenage-young adult thing. Older people have their own worries in life, they don't think about attractive artists.  Every boy band in every generation was hated: The Beatles, N-Sync, Back Street Boys, New Kids on the Block and it keeps going. More popular bands were hated more, less popular bands were hated less.  There are 2 things that factor hard into this hatred, it's jealousy over not being so successful and not being so attractive as the boys in the boy band. Average young man dreams of girls drooling over them, but it just doesn't happen so they hate those who it happens to.  People don't like to look jealous so they make up excuses to mask their insecurities, popular excuses would be: Their music is garbage - Then don't listen to it, there is a lot of garbage music out there, why are you focusing on them?They have an easy life - There is nothing easy having sudden success as a young person with all the sharks in Hollywood after you while the entire world watches and judges you. And nobody has an easy life while making successful music. Both OD and JB do a lot more work than I do or do you think music magically just happens with them doing nothing?Horrible person - This is more for Justin Bieber. I have literally seen people say that Justin Bieber is the worst person in the world, like a lot, I have seen that more than at least hundred times. Really? Worst Person? So all the murderers, rapists, serial killers and all those get a free pass to be above him?  Who ever says that Justin Bieber is a horrible person is clearly insecure about himself. I did a lot worse things as a kid than he did from breaking into bars/military secure areas to stealing money from pockets. They can't sing - He can actually sing if you Youtube his live performances. Bieber wasn't actually recruited by Usher because of his looks as a kid, he was recruited because he had a good voice and made Youtube videos which people liked. One Direction singers can sing as well, they were picked up by Simon Cowell from a talent show, they would have gotten far in talent show, maybe one of them would have even won if Cowell wouldn't have picked them up.They aren't talented - They clearly have talent for singing, what else talent do you need to be an artist?He does drugs - Like pretty much every artist ever? If you think Justin Bieber is the only artist who does drugs, you are in for a ride buddy. I personally don't understand hating somebody who you don't personally know. I don't have any judgement over actors or singers. Even if I hear them doing something shitty on the news, I wasn't there and I don't believe everything that I read so I can't make a judgement over something I am not too sure about.  Hate is a strong word. This is an example how to avoid people: A: I hate Justin Bieber - Avoid, obviously an insecure teenager. B: I don't like his music, but other than that I don't really care - This is a normal person.  I like music that boy bands create, so goes for OD and Justin Bieber, while Bieber isn't really a boyband, still goes kinda under the same category. I don't care about words in the song, I just like catchy tunes.  ",
