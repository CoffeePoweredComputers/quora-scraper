            "answer_text": "OKAY THAT\u2019S IT. EVERYBODY HEAR ME OUT. BEFORE I STARTED, IMMA TELL YOU I\u2019M A HUGE FAN OF STRAY KIDS. I HAD BEEN A STAY SINCE 2018 AND OBVIOUSLY I UPDATE MYSELF ABOUT WOOJIN SINCE STRAY KIDS IS INVOLVED. I know many fans have shown evidence about Woojin bullying or abused the member. I DO NOT CALL THAT EVIDENCE and I tell you, if you show that to a police or detective, they probably would have the same thought as me. WHY?? Listen. Before I enter that part, I want to ask you guys something. DID YOU REALLY NOT EXPECT 9 GUYS LIVING TOGETHER TO NOT FIGHT??? THEY ARE LITERALLY GROWN UP GUY. Let me tell you an incident that happen in Stray Kids. One time, Seungmin asked Han to clean up the room and Han threw a wallet at him. Then they argue a bit but later Han apologize to him saying he wasn\u2019t in his right mind because he was tired and just woke up. DO YOU SEE? Even the slightest stuff can make them mad. They are idols and idols have a hectic schedule especially active idols like Stray Kids. Idol life are stressful as well. OKAY SO NOW IMAGINE THIS SCENARIO. Two member argue and faught, then suddenly were told to do vlive with other member.They had no chance to reconcile and had to proceed. In the vlive, they talk normally to other member and fans but they didn\u2019t talk to each other. Now tell me. Among all the fans that watched the live, HOW MANY FANS THAT REALIZED THAT 2 MEMBERS WERE FIGHTING?? EXACTLY!! NOBODY KNOWS!!! BECAUSE THEY WERE TRYING THEIR BEST TO ACT NORMAL. ESPECIALLY IF THE GUY ACT CUTE OR FUNNY AND ALL THE MEMBER LAUGH. NO ONE WILL REALIZED THAT THE GUY RELATIONSHIP WITH ONE OF THE MEMBER IS ACTUALLY BAD. You guy get what I\u2019m trying to say right?? We don\u2019t have any connection with Stray Kids other than being a STAY. We don\u2019t know them PERSONALLY! SO WHO ARE WE TO TALK ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP. Sorry to say this but you guys are blinded about Woojin case and started to bring him down. If this is how it is, then I can bring up any other Stray Kids member weird behavior too. Let\u2019s say if the bully was Minho for example. Fans will give eViDenCE that shows Hyunjin mention Minho stuffing tissue in his mouth and him always getting scare at Minho. If Chan was the bully, fans will show the video Weekly Idol recently that the mc asked who has been hurted by Chan before to the member and all the member jokingly raise up their hand but 100% there will be fans who say that \u2018what if the members weren\u2019t lying and they were giving a clue to STAY but they ended up laughing it off to not cause a controversy\u2019 and the video during their survival show era where Chan scolded I.N asking him to dance properly and fans will say that \u2018Chan was too much! I know he\u2019s a leader but that was too harsh since I.N was still young at that time! Poor our maknae!\u2019 Woojin situation was honestly no different than this. The video he did the Stray Kids introduction and elbowed Minho on his face or eye(idek). Yes, Minho look in pain but remember that they were standing close to each other and I see this happen in other kpop group as well. I\u2019m not surprised it hit Minho. Plus, it didn\u2019t look like Woojin was exaggerating at all. I\u2019m an asian and he was bowing while doing the introduction. I don\u2019t get why y\u2019all make it such a big deal!! That\u2019s fucking normal!! Other video as well about the one Woojin push Felix at the bench and other member protecting I.N from Woojin and much more. YOU CALLED THAT EVIDENCE??!! AND THE FACT THAT FROM THESE VIDEO, PEOPLE ACTUALLY ARRIVED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT WOOJIN BULLY AND ABUSED THE MEMBER LIKE WTF IS THAT??!!! I don\u2019t support Woojin until he was proven innocent completely. I want to tell you guys that we as fans, we don\u2019t have the right to meddle in Stray Kids relationship among member. This is where our limit goes. I\u2019m not saying that Stray Kids personality is fake in front camera. I doubt that their personality is difference, seeing how chilled they are sometimes when a member just suddenly appear in front their room with a camera. They only panic when their not wearing make up or they had stuff they didn\u2019t want to show fans like branded stuff for example as idols aren\u2019t allowed fyi. Idols are human. I\u2019m tired of saying this shit. There\u2019s actually no need for me to mention this but some fans are really stubborn. DID YOU EXPECT THEM TO BE HAPPY FOR 24 HOURS?? DID YOU THINK THEY WOULD SHOW THEIR SAD AND STRESS IN FRONT CAMERA?? Their only job as an idol was to perform, entertain, sending beautiful message to the world like giving motivation and be a good role model to young generation. Everyone has that another side of them. And when it gets too much, it shows in front camera and they can\u2019t hide it. Example, Han anxiety. It gets to the point where JYP had to release a statement about it. He probably hide it before but he can\u2019t hide it any longer. I\u2019m glad JYP did that. STAYS will understand this and won\u2019t be too hype if they accidently saw Han somewhere else alone to not make him panic. So my conclusion, don\u2019t ever meddle in Stray Kids relationship again. This is their business. I know it upsets us if they fight among each other but let\u2019s just wish they don\u2019t. And don\u2019t spread negative energy around. We are better than this. Didn\u2019t someone precious to STAY say this to us? ",

I think that there may have been some altercations especially since the video of Hyun-jin pushing woojin away from jeongin was released and some staff members confirmed he had been violent with I think it was Felix, jisung, and jeongin. I really just hope he didn't seriously hurt anybody, well any more than he already has. ",
