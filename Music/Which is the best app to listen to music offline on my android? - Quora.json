            "answer_text": "The Top 5 Music Apps for Offline Listening: Bloom.FM First up is relative newcomer Bloom.fm, a radio and music discovery app. The iPhone app lets you stream full tracks and playlists and enables you to save tracks to your iPhone. Bloom.fm calls its offline service \"borrowing\" and it works much like traditional renting systems: users download songs to their devices, listen to them offline and, when they've had enough, swap them for different songs. Groove Groove for iPhone has been getting a lot of attention recently, especially after reaching 85,000 downloads in just 24 hours and becoming the number-one music app in the Canadian App Store. Groove is like Apple's Genius on turbocharge. The app taps into users' iTunes collections to quickly and effortlessly create a variety of smart playlists and instant mixes.  Spotify I couldn't talk about music apps without mentioning at least one of the big players. There are a number of popular music streaming platforms out there, Rdio and Pandora for example, but Spotify is my personal favorite. Spotify's $9.99 per month Premium package lets users sync songs, albums and playlists for offline playback. This is a great feature if, like me, you're always looking to discover new music and then listen back when you're on the move. Swarm.fm One of the advantages of Spotify is that many other apps now sync with the service via the \"Spotify Apps\" and \"Libspotify\" APIs. Of these, I love Swarm.fm. Through this Spotify-based app, users quickly create playlists of their recently played artists and tracks and use the \"similar mix\" to discover new music. The only downside is, as with many of the apps available via the Spotify platforms, Swarm.fm isn't currently available for iOS. So, if you wanted to make use of Swarm.fm's playlist creator, you'd need to create the playlists using your premium account on the Spotify desktop or web apps and then sync to mobile. Not great when you're without a laptop. Tunigo One team quick to take advantage of Spotify's Libspotify API was the folks behind playlist finder Tunigo. If syncing your tracks via the desktop seems a bit of a hassle, Tunigo is the answer. Although Tunigo lacks the playlist generating powers of Swarm.fm, the app brings pre-made playlist discovery to the iPhone. You do need an Internet connection to search, subscribe and download the playlists, but once you've synced the playlists you're all set for offline listening.   ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone here promoting their own crap apps. Ridiculous. Nothing good in this world is free for always, so if you are really a sound lover then i believe you won't mind buying a music app from play store by paying some penny to few bucks, believe me they deserve the money. Let'scheck my suggestion- Neutron Music PlayerPowerampJetAudioYour Android\u2019s default music playerI have personally bought all the above apps and at present i mostly use Poweramp. Let me tell difference between these three in short- Neutron music player gives you plenty of option to customize things out how would you like to listen you music with 64 bit audio processing and others tons of feature. This player sports almost any format. Continuous update DLNA support and many things just go through the settings in this app. Trial also available. Where in Poweramp, you will get best UI and other customisation and sound clarity is really awesome. Jet audio is mixed of you can say, Neutron and Poweramp with third party audio enhancer DSP supports and similar kind of of feature as above two. So while concluding, if you want to do lots of experiment with your audio then go for Neutron (though i neither understood all that settings of Neutron not used). At present I'm using Poweramp and if you want limited but best way to control the audio go for this having option to increase base and terrible additionally than its equilizer presets. And if you want to try some more ease bursting sound from your ear peace then go for JetAudio. As simple as that. ",
