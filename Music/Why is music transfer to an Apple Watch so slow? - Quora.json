            "answer_text": "The connection between your phone and your watch is bluetooth, it\u2019s not a particularly high bandwidth connection (in today\u2019s measurements) and you\u2019re moving files that are megabytes in size. Depending how much music you\u2019re moving, it can end up being a sizable amount. So, takes a while. This is the same reason that software updates on the watch are slow too. ",
