            "answer_text": "I tried free Protools First (I thought about purchasing commercial version) and have deeper knowledges in Cubase. Below my personal opinion on current moment, that is not definitive even for me: Functionality is close. Maybe deeper abilities in editing or bus/wire commutations are there. But it is need to learn more.Quick start: I have launched Cubase to sounding faster (I have enough deep skill in DAWs). But it is not problem for further work.Sound quality: both ok. Accounting different instruments was used.Usability/interface: both ok, both use hotkeys.Resume For my tasks: there is no big difference between these digital audio workstations,Cubase have lesser price of owning,But for you, ProTools may be more appropriate. I\u2019d recomment try both these and other digital audio workstations to create several tracks before choice. ",

            "answer_text": "As Cubase has developed the lines between Pro-tools and Cubase have slowly demised. To make a truly fair comparison between the two approaches you would really need to look at Nuendo, as Cubase is a lighter version of Steinberg's flagship product Nuendo; the comparisons are then down to the individual. Some producers would not look at any other system other than Pro-Tools while other like myself have moved from Pro-Tools to Nuendo. i personally find the navigation when producing to be more flexible to my approach to production. On the other hand the outboard hardware for Pro-Tools is still considered one of the best, if not the best. ",
