            "answer_text": "It is difficult to answer that without knowing which Ibanez you are talking about specifically. If it is the RG, PG, JEM series, then they can be at par with many good guitar brands out there. Better? I am not so sure. Fenders are always great those glassy, neck-pick-up-y sounds that is excellent for traditional blues and rock n roll. Gibsons have great tone and legacy too (some of the recent build quality has been questionable but that\u2019s for another day) I think it\u2019s the Ibanez\u2019s versatility which works well. The HSH pick-up configuration with the five-way selector gives you a lot of options. Ibanez from Team J Craft (the guitar I am fortunate to own) has just tremendous build quality. The trem control is perfect and the feel is good too. Is it better than the other guitars of that range? Since this is the Team J Craft model, I can say probably but its a tough bet. If you are looking for a overall shreddy sound with plenty of in-guitar tone options and good trem control, Ibanez\u2019s good. But then I have heard that the latest Edge Tremolo is bad. So I don\u2019t know :-) It\u2019s all about what sound you are chasing. ",

What makes any mass produced guitars is quality control. Ibanez has great quality control. And sometimes you get lucky. Like I bought my Fender Telecaster for $149.00 + tax. I play Maggie , the most out of my collection. I have some more expensive guitars. Maggie, she the one. I'm always reaching for!!! P.S. Always look for quality control tags on guitars. These guitars are set up perfectly!!! To specs. I have three quality control tag guitars. They all play better than some very high end guitars. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think that they are. Some Ibanez models are as good as many other brands and models but they are hardly the best. If anyone tries to convince you that they are then they are just blowing smoke up your butt. I have owned several Ibanez guitars but I never really seem to hold onto them because I have others I liked much better. For example Paul Reed Smith to me is a much better guitar and even the less expensive PRS models to me are better than many Ibanez guitars. Currently I don\u2019t own a single Ibanez. Don\u2019t get me wrong Ibanez does make a fine guitar but they are far from the best. For me the Ibanez guitars made in Japan in the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s were some of the best guitars they ever produced. Even some of the 90\u2019s guitars were very nice. I had an Ibanez Ghostrider with P-90\u2019s that I loved, I had a Iceman that I wish I still had but I wasn\u2019t too sad to sell my Jem just because I prefer a fixed bridge over a Floyd Rose. I\u2019ve had other Ibanez guitars as well but I had no real attachment to many of them but they were good guitars. ",

Personally\u2026I couldn't get comfortable with any I tried\u2026. including an acoustic I used to own. Too thin of a neck makes MY hand cramp. For me what makes for a superior guitar is comfort, sound and what fits the song/mix best. Sometimes it's my strat, sometimes one of my telecaster's(I have 2 because I keep 1 in open G tuning). Sometimes it's my LP and sometimes my SG. And of course sometimes NOTHING works better than 1 of my acoustics. ",
