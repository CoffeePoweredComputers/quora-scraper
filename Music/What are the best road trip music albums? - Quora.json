            "answer_text": "I think that instead of naming a best album, it\u2019s better to name a best type of album. For example, I wouldn\u2019t want to listen to new age music - might put me to sleep if I was on a long, straight highway. And hard rock - well, I\u2019d probably blast it and have ringing in my ears when I arrived at my destination. And complex progressive rock - I\u2019d be so focused on the music (trying to figure out the time signatures) that I\u2019d forget I was driving. So I\u2019d vote for middle-of-the-road pop or rock. Just enough energy to keep me alert to my surroundings and somewhat engaged with the music. Maybe with sing-along opportunities. Early-to-mid-career Beatles, Tom Petty, ELO Fleetwood Mac \u2026 you get the picture. ",
