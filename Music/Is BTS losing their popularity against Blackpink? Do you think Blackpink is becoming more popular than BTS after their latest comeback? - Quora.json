            "answer_text": "Not necessarily! As Blackpink\u2019s so called popularity is based upon YouTube views and YouTube records. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. But YouTube views should not be the criteria for measuring popularity. There are other criterias to like album sales, brand reputation, public perception, fan following and many more. On top of that BTS or any other group is bound to lose popularity over time. People in the Fandom growup and have to invest their precious time in their personal lives, rather than supporting a music group, which by the way would come under entertainment that is a luxury commodity. On top of that BTS is Blackpink\u2019s senior, there is a three year gap between the two groups debut year. As we know that younger people have more energy so it completely make sense that BTS might be tired of the competition and rather want to relax and make music.(sorry to make it sound like BTS as a decade old group \ud83e\udd23) But to prove my point I would give you evidence that BTS no longer care about the YouTube views: A big example of this is their 2020 release schedule. They first released a art performance video for the pre release i.e Black Swan.Then they released the performance video of the title track ONand after that they released the MV for there title track. Which is very unconventional and if you wanted to get YouTube views then a very bad formulaThen after a month I think they released the MV for Black Swan. Now tell me what was the purpose of the art performance video for the song if they already planned to released a MV for the same?All of the points above states that BTS no longer care for YouTube views rather they want to put out different contents for their fans. They are trying to enrich the pallet of the viewers and give them a full experience. While on the other hand YG (Blackpink\u2019s company) starve the fans for months only put out one MV and nothing else so that the fans only stream only the MV and nothing else making it easy for the MV to break multiple records. But all this at the expense of Blackpink themselves. The members have come out multiple times that they want to give out more content but alas the company just see them as a cash grab. So the answer is no BTS is not losing popularity they are at the best place they can be. \ud83d\ude07\u270c\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "ofcourse not. I mean just youtube views can not make a group more popular. blackpink has their own strategy to gain views.well they made blinks to wait for their come back for about 1 year or longer. after releasing the mv milions of thirsty blinks and other fandoms will watch the mv to see what did they do after a long absence. and about losing popularity of bts omg their fandom is spreading like a virus over the world map of the soul 7 became one of the most streamed albums and if u mean because of the views although it isnt really important we can consider some reasons: the views spread in not just a single video but first in kinetic version of on then official mv of it and after that the black swan mvyoutube deleted 60 milion of views in first 24 hours( maybe its isnt true but some armies noticed that and took a screen shot of it)its just a personal opinion but on shouldnt be the lead single beacuse it wasnt sound like a hit to me i mean if bighit made blackswan the lead single and made a mv with more visual stuff it would the best bts comebackit might be crazy :) but I think bts comeback interfere with corona virus thing and at first they couldnt have many shows but now we can see that idols show come back to normal in koreasome people said that stay gold released at the same time with how you like that but it has fewer views . its is so obvious as i said it was blackpink\u2019s comeback but stay gold was a Japanese song that bts released it after 210394393993939 song after their comebackand the last and the most important reason is bighit doesnt care about the views anymore if they cared they would release just one song with one mv each year for streamingbts is the only kpop group with ama and billboard and other global awards and the first ones that perform the GRAMMY we shouldnt compare it to bp who has only a few songs and not a official album although I like blackpink too ",
