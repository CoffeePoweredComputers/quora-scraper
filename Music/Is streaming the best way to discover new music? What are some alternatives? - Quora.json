            "answer_text": "Short answer: no. Find an experimental radio station like Where the Music Matters Long answer: I don\u2019t think that streaming is the best alternative because, from everything I\u2019ve seen, streaming recommends things based upon what you\u2019re already listening to, IE, more of the same. Meaning, it\u2019s probably going to \u2018curate\u2019 something based upon the decade, genre (new wave, metal, etc), and \u2018related\u2019 acts from those two criteria. Likelihood is, you\u2019ll already be familiar with those \u2018associated\u2019 acts. I call this the Pandora principle. I\u2019m an 80\u2019s kid. Let\u2019s say I want to listen to some post-punk like PiL. OK, great. I put in \u2018PiL Radio\u2019 and I hear some PiL. Maybe then I hear some Gang of Four. So far, so good, right? Sure. But then, BOOM! Tears for Fears. What the actual heck? TFF is from the 80\u2019s, and could loosely be lumped into the same \u2018category\u2019 as PiL and Gang of Four (meaning, non-mainstream music of the 80\u2019s). Although TFF had lots of radio play, the fact remains, they\u2019re considered more an \u2018alternative\u2019 act than a \u2018pop\u2019 act. And to Pandora, that\u2019s all that matters. (BTW, TFF is not post-punk and doesn\u2019t belong on a playlist with PiL). This also seems to be the case where Spotify is concerned - more of what they see you currently \u2018like\u2019 at the moment. This forces people into musical bubbles - you can like Metallica, but you\u2019ll never see Johnny Cash pop up in a \u2018recommended based upon\u2019. And from a computer\u2019s viewpoint, that makes perfect sense. Old country music vs. metal. Does not compute. However, it\u2019s perfectly reasonable for you to like both artists. But that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll get the opportunity to discover that based on a streaming algorithm. ",

Google will give you genre based stations magazines and blogs, youtube with give you the music and a way to contact the artist. hope this helps :) Peter  ",
