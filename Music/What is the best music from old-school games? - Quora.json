            "answer_text": "The mario themes and Legend of Zelda music are really nostalgic for me and I find them quite endearing and melodious. If Undertale can be considered as an old-school game (although its new, it has an old-school, indie feel to it), I feel it has the most amazing music. Megalovania and Bergentruckung themes from Undertale are splendid ear candy. Hope this helped :D. ",
