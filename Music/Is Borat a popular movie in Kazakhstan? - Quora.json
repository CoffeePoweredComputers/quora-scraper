            "answer_text": "Why should it be a popular movie in Kazakhstan?! Borat movie has nothing to do with Kazakhstan. It was shot by an Enlglish actor and comedian in a Romanian village and in the US mocking the American folks and their negative features. Borat is hated by majority Kazakhs, because he pretends to be from Kazakhstan and displays fake Kazakh traditions. Certainly the things Borat does in his movie ensures nagative connotations about Kazakhstan, that\u2019s why people hate Borat. Kazakh people display respect and affection for other people and countries, and expect the same from others. For Kazakhs national dignity and respect is much higher then personal dignity and repect. Thus, Kazakhs can stand the nagtivity or indignity for him/her personally, but not for their nation, land, mothers. Actually, Borat could be used as a good marketing character to attract tourists. But majority Kazakhs will not understand and accept it. ",

            "answer_text": "Not particularly. Not many people speak English. People have heard about the movie but they don\u2019t really care. It is a fictional movie with no foundation in reality, using a real country name. It would be a similar to making a Russian movie about aliens in New York. Not many Americans would care to watch it. I think Sascha Cohen was just not creative enough to come up with a fictional name. ",
