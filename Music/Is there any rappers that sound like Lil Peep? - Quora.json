            "answer_text": "Plent of them copy hin but none sound like him. Peep isnt gonna be replaced. He cant be. If you like peeps music listen to him dont give attention to these copies. But if you dont really care about that then Steven moses is probably as close as you'll get to peep without it being peep. Note he isnt as emotionally alluring as peep or as cool or anything in my opinion. Peeps peep. No one gonna be him or replicate his style. If you're just looking for more good emo rappers here's a VERY good lost Juice wrld r.i.p. Xxxtentacion r.i.p. Fatse' 99feetofsmoke Lil Lotus Lil tracy- this is the one you want if you love peep and goth boi clique Gaurdin All these aerisy have similar feelings as peep but they dont sound like peep they're their own thing all of them not copies at all just highly inspired by the genre. Let me know what you think of those please!!! ",
