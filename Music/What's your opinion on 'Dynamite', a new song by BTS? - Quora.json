            "answer_text": " Like Netflix\u2019s Riverdale, BTS\u2019s Dynamite seems very dreamlike with retro vintage elements that pay homage to the golden age of America especially with the whole song in English. This got me so excited because the settings are something I was very familiar with and to see my favorite East Asians living out mainstream every day American life feels very close to home. I just really celebrate anything combining East and West culture.  It started off with all band members in casual pastel-colored outfits against the pink cotton candy gradient sky with lots of natural sunlight and sunshine like true BTS fashion\u2026 it was the same summery, gentle, light, sweet, pure, bright, magical unicorn utopia vibes I got from their other work like Stay Gold music video, Boy with Luv concert performance, BTS World! mobile app summer events and recent Baskin Robbins commercial with their pastel color gradient theme/tone palette. Melissa Lim's answer to Which music video is better, \"Stay Gold\" or \"ON\" by BTS? There\u2019s even this pastel color palette named Miami Vice, inspired by the tv show. https://www.mrporter.com/en-sg/journal/fashion/the-pastel-soaked-return-of-miami-vice-style-1080220   Opening Scene in Dynamite  Ending Scene in Stay Gold   Baskin Robbin\u2019s Commercial   Boys with Luv Concert Performance  I even hunted down the cotton candy cloud pattern outfit so I could wear it and join in on the Dynamite lip sync on TikTok to spread the positive energy!  BTS World! Summer Event  Here are other times they used the unicorn, cotton candy pastel gradient color palette theme tone too:   I got super excited when the scene cut to Jungkook's first solo appearance in a typical suburban middle class teenage American high school boy room in the attic.    I then lost my shit when I noticed the posters were of Western pop culture legends of my beloved parents' time like David Bowie, Terminator, and The Beatles! They were dinner table conversation topics that contributed to the bonding sessions between me and the beloved family members of yesteryear. This makes the scene and Jungkook not just relevant to teenagers today, but it also induced a lot of nostalgia for our parents or grandparents generation. I feel like the posters showed great respect to Western icons.    This bedroom scene is just so relatable to every American suburban middle-class teenager even in the flyover states or those who been through that phase. I mean a lot of MVs focus on coastal cities and $20 million dollar Hollywood Hills mansions but Jungkook\u2019s room is very inclusive - it feels like an \u201ceveryroom\u201d familiar to a lot of people, complete with the guitar, backpack, wakeboard, old-school alarm clock, keyboard piano, wooden drawers and table, clothes draped over chairs, stuff on the floor, cheap lighting, Bart Simpson sticker, posters, paper calendar, a pot of plant, laundry basket, and makes Jungkook seem like the All American boy-next-door sweetheart the typical middle-class American teenager grew up with. A neighbor who you form a band with, play football, have a crush on & go to prom with. You know, very Noah Centineo. That boy who would come ring your doorbell, say hi to your Dad, watch you walking down the stairs all dressed up and wowing then take you to the 3-hour movie and dinner date. The internet\u2019s boyfriend. how noah centineo became the internet's boyfriend   The time era also feels retro with many heavy references to the past. Who still uses the old school alarm clock and paper calendar instead of digital ones synced to their smartphones or MAC laptop?    I almost lost my shit when Jungkook drank a glass of milk and even referenced it in the lyrics. Stereotypically, boys going through puberty would seem fueled by testosterone and experimenting with all sorts of vices trying to distance themselves from their PG-13 friendly persona, opting for a more tough guy macho man look. You have an image of a boy sneaking girlfriends in, trying to clean up cum-stained bedsheets, and watching porn with extra-large condoms (they usually think they\u2019re more well endowed than they are until they been with enough girls who slip their tongue and insult their manhood after they break up) on the bedside table and dirty socks on the floor. The clothes draped on the wall hooks and chairs also fit the image. Then - wait for it- Jungkook grabs the milk! It just made everything pure and innocent again and immediately canceled out dirty thoughts formulated in your mind because of the typical key triggers of a horny teenager in the scene. Even his outfits, denim jeans with a match denim jacket over a plain white tee, floppy hair, earrings, and brown suede shoes can\u2019t get any more typical. Here\u2019s Archie Andrews from Riverdale your typical all American high school sweetheart from the midwest in all denim.   He even managed to make an underground bunker look like a stereotypical all American boy next door room with the guitar, wooden table, cheap chair, dirty tee draped over something, a bedside table.  See socks on floor and similar striped/checkered bedsheets as Jungkook.  This is the love shot. The typical smirk on the cutest boy in school.  After Jungkook, RM dancing in a laser disc shop appeared! Are those still available today? It makes us feel so spoiled that we can now just enjoy their music video on YouTube while people in the 1970s have to buy a laser disc to see Michael Jackson. It is not even the small laser disc but the large 30 cm one. I love the internet today and can\u2019t believe it didn\u2019t exist just a few decades ago. Not sure why they promoting Dynamite LaserDisc when they don't manufacture that anymore (just found out they have limited edition vinyl and cassette collection!). It definitely fits the vintage retro disco vibe though.     This dance move is similar to John Travolta     So Dynamite introduced the everyday room with Jungkook and now the other everyday place, a burger and donut diner through funky J Hope!    We see such scenes in Riverdale Pop\u2019s Chock\u2019Lit Shoppe/Diner and Justin Timberlake\u2019s Can\u2019t Stop the Feeling music video, which was the best selling song in 2016. In Pop\u2019s Diner, you see that it is where they all gather with friends for burgers, shakes and donuts. In Dynamite, you see Jungkook entering Dynamite Burger and Donut to join his friends eating all American classic food staples like a donut (no Kimchi and Ricecake in this video!).           Like Timberlake\u2019s CSTF music video, BTS\u2019s Dynamite has a delightful feel-good jam perfect for the summer season. It is a very lightweight, catchy, disco-beat song that puts you in the mood to dance for TGIF or dance away the Monday blues. In Can\u2019t Stop the Feeling there are scenes of Timberlake, the cashier, and the waitress dancing disco beats inside and outside the dinner just like Dynamite.       Next, playground basketball. Years ago, there was a controversy that playground basketball was dying. Like all things vintage today (physical bookstores, CD shops, etc) there is always that period of the eclipse with new, smart technology that destroys the old, making it really hard for sentimental old school folks to accept and stay goodbye. They highlighted this scene with the perfect basketball shooting guard Yoongi! This was a time when many teenage boys gathered in their nearby neighborhood for some sports to past time instead of playing games like Starcraft or Overwatch like they do today.   This wall Graffiti reminds me of this one reminds me of downtown in my downtown in America. In East Asia I don\u2019t see graffiti walls like this too much.  Of course no summer is complete without the ice cream truck! They even branded the ice cream truck with Dynamite and make the ice cream colors pastel like the logo! They still exist today but not as popular as they used to be.  Now, this disco part reminds me of the pictures my Dad showed me of him and his crew dressing all funky, with the bell-bottom/corduroy pants, oversized tinted glasses, and going to the disco which we now call \u201cclubbing\u201d. It reminds me of great dancing legends like John Travolta!  Their combing hair dance move reminds me of the 1970s where my Dad has this pointed comb in his bell bottom jeans which he always took our to comb his slick gelled hair         V in his bright green vest and bell bottom is very 70s disco fashion!  This pose by Jin in the disco gets me. Reminds me of John Travolta in his golden years as the dancing king in Saturday Night Fever.   The brown outfit reminds me of my father\u2019s time too. Finally a music video I can send to my Dad and he can appreciate.          It brought back a lot of 1970s music my father always watched with me like Grease. I\u2019m so glad the boys nailed this part of the Golden Age of America so perfectly with their own fresh twist, capturing the funk and soul of these spirit of those times that has yet to take over by social media and modern, smart technology. It showed a simpler time with simpler pleasures such as friends actually meeting face-to-face for old school entertainment by gathering at the playground basketball court, disco, record shop, ice cream truck, and the local donut joint/burger diner to dance the morning, afternoon and night away instead of just using the social network to talk to each other.   Finally, the ending was just DYNAMITE. Like a unicorn just exploded. Or maybe it was just Jin.       After the explosion, there was peace in this magical, dreamlike place.  BTS and the Big Hit Team just prove their creative genius and versatility with this fun retro concept. ",

            "answer_text": "I have maybe a controversial opinion on Dynamite. Note: I also have an emotional bias toward it. So if you don\u2019t want to hear the negative alongside some positive - this isn\u2019t the answer for you. However this is a very genuine response from an army who has stanned bts for so many years. The song is quite catchy, fun and the boys visuals are OUTSTANDING. Those are my positives. It\u2019s a shame that I can\u2019t listen to the song without hurt feelings because it\u2019s quite catchy and I love good vibes. edit 23/08/2020 - Guys I\u2019ve been listening to the song constantly. I dance around my house constantly because the song makes me feel light and vibey (when I forget about some bs behind it). I really love jamming to the song. I just wish it was put together differently. Now onto my main point. Before the song came out, I was so hyped like everyone else. I had my reservations about the song being in English but I\u2019ll get more into that later. During these hard times - a fun and happy upbeat song is all we need. The teasers came out and my excitement built. The night of the release - I drank with my parents (they are fans too, and they actually love the song even now) , got on a funky outfit, did the dynamite dance challenge - I can\u2019t explain how excited I was! The premiere released and I watched. Jungkook started the song and it was fun - he\u2019s such a damn cutie, he\u2019s my double bias with hoseok and literally this kid can do no wrong he\u2019s outstanding - the lyrics were nonsensical which is a huge bummer but whatever. My dad later said there was references that threw it back to that time period so that was a nice touch - but nonsensical nonetheless. Namjoon\u2019s part wasn\u2019t rly great in my opinion but I liked the tone change and the beat. Hoseok\u2019s part came and went - I liked his voice even though I didn\u2019t like increasing auto tune. His verse wasn\u2019t memorable because it was later repeated by Jimin. Taehyung and Yoongi\u2019s scene and part were a little better I liked the vibe. Things started becoming a blur here because my anxiety was rising. Jimin and Jungkook were killing it with their dancing - like jimin is so sexy but I was getting anxious where is Hoseok showing his retro vibin dance? I know people say not get stuck on line distribution and I usually don\u2019t but if you are going to give him a shorter time frame than the big hit intro - at least let the man dance center or solo. Or let him shimmy with JK and Jimin. Where is Seokjin? Oh there he his, he looks great in the center but that\u2019s all? Oh here\u2019s Jungkook and Jimin again. And again. Why is everyone else to the side? Why is Hoseok barely dancing? We are getting his visuals but why is he not giving us anything else? The song was becoming more hype meanwhile I started crying. I\u2019m sorry if that sounds dramatic but my heart was hurting so much.  ^ this YT post sums up what it was. I like the one which said Jikook ft. BTS Now please note, I love Jungkook and Jimin - I literally bias Jungkook but I need to just put a literally personal explaination as to why I reacted this way (please bare with me). Jung Hoseok is my role model for life. He is literally my hope. Watching him is what helped me rekindle my passion for dance and the stage. He did this when I was at the lowest point in my life. I admire and respect him beyond measure. I always thought: \u201cif I can\u2019t live that life of the stage, I will be at utter peace knowing he shines brightly\u201d. But what happens when your hero (or to make it more metaphorically beautiful) - your sun - begins to get shadowed by constant clouds. What if your reason for having hope for your own life is paid to dust? It started with the EGO MV. Which was one of my favourite songs and mvs to date - it held so much truth especially in 2020. But people trended hate wanting a Jungkook outro. I was broken then, I thought how could people be so horrible and blinded? He is so talented and artful. ON and Black Swan sidelined him too - I was drained and sad about it - but I thought maybe I\u2019m looking to it too hard, he will shine bright again- Ya so basically this song - despite being cheerful. Made me step back from BTS. The company seems to be catering to ships and bubblegum. It\u2019s working because there are millions of fans ready to hype it up. The boys promoted it saying it would show their individuality and charm. I can\u2019t help but question their authenticity in this statement. Are they actually happy with this result? Is Hoseok happy? Jin? RM? Suga? If they are all the power to them. Suga said \u201cDon\u2019t think too much and enjoy the song\u201d. But sorry I can\u2019t enjoy something blindly. Especially being a long time fan. I have such a hard time believing they agree with all this. It makes me question how much of them are genuine anymore. I get it. It\u2019s a job and a business. They are rich beyond measure. There\u2019s a lot of behind the scene things that we have no idea about. But still. It sucks. Which brings me to my last point. The western music industry got what they wanted. They will happily promote this song because it was written by them and not bts. It\u2019s all in English. God forbid they ever promoted their Korean songs. It isn\u2019t deep or very meaningful so it fits their agenda of what a boy band should be boxed into. It will break records and be on the radio. Army will be thrilled. However my opinion still stands. What do you think? Please don\u2019t hate on me, as I wish with all my heart I could be hyping it up. But I want to stay true to myself and share my thoughts. This song really severed the love I had for the army community and BTS. I will still love and respect the boys. But I feel like my wishes as a fan and hopes for my bias are being ignored or worse - shut down. So I don\u2019t know if I have a place in the fandom as of right now after this. Edit: I want to add this from jhope\u2019s wiki just to prove points - hoseok is not only a rapper - but he also is a singer and his genre usually includes funk-soul and retro elements , so for anyone thinking that lines are given to those who suit the song - this ones for you  ",
