            "answer_text": "When I read your question I had a flashback to a time when something similar happened to me. The situation was: I had a jazz standard or maybe the score of a rock tune. I read the chords and, damn it, they didn't sound like I expected. But somehow this situation ended one day when I was studying composition, and don't remember when. The only thing I know is that somehow it stopped. But I think I can tell you why. What was I doing wrong. These are some possible causes: You are playing every note of the chord. When you have to play some chord with tensions, you have to omit some notes so that the chord doesn't sound too heavy and it doesn't spoils the result. When you read G7(b13), you have to know which notea you have to omit on order to keep the quality of the chord aa well as its color. In the example, you should omit the fifth and the root. Besides, when the 13th is present, you need the ninth to give it support unless it's indicated. So you need to learn the fundamentals of chord substitution and tension.You may be playing things inaccurately. Maybe you are reading the score but you are making some mistakes here and there, playing some mistaken notes. So you need zo practice and to make sure that you are really playing what it is on the paper.You may be playing things at the wrong tempo or with the wrong rhythm. You need to practice and to play things accurately, rhythmically speaking, keeping a steady tempo. It's fine to play things slower, but your tempo should be solid as a rock.You may be playing the notes of the chord uneven. When playing a chord notes have to sound even. When you master this, you'll learn to emphasize some notes when needed. But as a rule of thumb, the first thing is to get an even sound, every note should sound clearly. That's a matter of technique. You need to learn how to produce this even sound. Maybe you need lessons with a teacher.Maybe you are playing in the wrong register. Playing chords too low can make you sound dirty. Unless intended on purpose, you have too play your accompaniment not too low. One sixth below medium C is safe when playing with a band. You can go lower when playing alone, but not all the chord, just the bass.Maybe you are not spreading your voicings correctly. This is a matter of style also, but when intervals are too tighten in the low register, they can obscure too much the chord, producing a more percussive sound. It's good when intended. Otherwise, spread your chords a little. Open the intervals in the lower voices.Maybe you are not familiar with the sound of the chord. Polychords, augmented chords, chords with tensions, are complex sonorities. You have to get used to them. The harsh sound is part of the beauty of the chord. That's why it's so important to play even. If all the notes sound even, you'll get used to the real sonirity. Sometimes a student tells me that ninths or 13ths sound bad. I takr the score and play it and ask them: \u201cDoes it sounds bad for you?\u201d They usually say: \u201cWell, no. That sounds great. But what were you playing?\u201d -I just used a 13 here and there. But I play even.And finally, your voicings may be wrong. Some tensions need to be above and some notes need to be below. In some chords, some intervals produce a harsh sound. For instance, a minor ninth is too disonant in a major chord. So if you play Cmaj7 but inverted, with the 7th on the bass, and the root is a minor ninth from the bass, it generally sound rare. There are ways to make it work, but you need to learn those tricks.I hope this answer is useful. ",

            "answer_text": "If your instrument is tuned properly, the first-position chords are relatively easy to finger and should sound \"pretty close\" at least. So you don't describe \"don't sound right\"......  What's going on?  Are the notes not clear....Making a thump or buzz sound on some strings?  Then likely you are not fretting properly as noted.   Or, are the notes sounding clearly but still sound off?   You don't say what kind of guitar you have, but it's possible that the intonation has not been set properly.  This can make a properly-fingered chord sound...\"off\". Finally, if the action on your instrument has not been set up properly, if it's too high...It can be very difficult to fret first-position chords and when you do, since you're \"pulling the strings sharp\"....They will sound bad. Have an experienced player examine your instrument, and your technique. ",
