            "answer_text": "Of those three, Spotify is the easy winner for one reason: Discover Weekly. It's a fascinating functionality. On most streaming services, music suggestions are provided in one of two ways: 1) Human people curate playlists and tell a computer who would like them or 2) Computers generate playlists based on algorithms and deliver them to algorithmically-determined users. #1 is generally considered \"better,\" but doesn't scale to tens of millions of users. #2 can theoretically scale forever, but is often characterized as \"dry,\" \"mainstream,\" or \"boring.\" Spotify figured out a really cool way to combine the two by utilizing a feature it has had for years\u2014the ability for users to make their own playlists. Instead of using an algorithm to determine what songs belong together, Discover Weekly uses the millions of human-created user playlists to do it, then strengthens them with machine learning and delivers a weekly mixtape to every single user based on the prior week's listening patterns. In effect, rather than one human offering you 5 playlists or one computer offering you 50, you have 5,000,000 humans suggesting songs you might like and one computer putting them together in a manageable way. The net effect is the surfacing of seriously not mainstream content, even if up to this point all you listened to is mainstream content. In my opinion it's one of the great technological breakthroughs in digital music streaming. ",
