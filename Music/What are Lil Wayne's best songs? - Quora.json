            "answer_text": "These are my favorite songs by album starting with Tha Carter. I don't remember his earlier albums being anything beyond mediocre. Tha Carter Walk In, Inside, and Walk Out - These 3 \"skits\" frame the album well as Weezy shows off his new-found command of imagery.B.M. Jr -  A hard hitting ode to his mentor, Birdman.Earthquake - A Light hearted and fun jam. Jazzy Pha helps Wayne show what it is to be fly.Tha Carter II Fireman - Our man Weezy spits hot fire.Best Rapper Alive - While he's not actually the best, he has improved significantly since he decided that he is.Oh No -  Another heavy hitter with excellent rapid fire rhymes.Shooter - The slowly building beat is accompanied by Wayne's catchy voice and slowly increasing rhyme tempo.Tha Carter III Mr. Carter - Lil Wayne outmatches Jay-Z, though Hov does a great job of mimicking Weezy's style.Dr. Carter - Maybe my favorite Lil Wayne song. The medical setting allows him to focus on a specific domain in his rhymes, affording more structure than usual. I also love the nontraditional breaks; a nurse reading a \"chart\" as opposed to a chorus.Let the Beat Build - The spiritual successor to Shooter. Lil Wayne is able to keep the listener thoroughly entertained while waiting for the eventual (and extremely satisfying) bass drop.Da Drought 3 MixtapeMy favorite Lil Wayne mixtape. Primarily consists of Wayne rapping over other artists' mainstream beats. Intro - Weezy explains why he's hot.Upgrade - Wayne upgrade's Beyonce's hit.Get High Rule the World - He gets high, then raps over Nas's classic.Dough is What I Got - Weezy's version of Jay-Z's comeback hit is more interesting than the original.Walk it Out - A dirty south take on Walk it Out.",

            "answer_text": "It is hard to say because this is totally subjective but I will give you an answer that has more of a historical point of view. Lil' Wayne's recently popularity and boom have made people completely forget his Hot Boyz days, which is sad. Get Off the Corner - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfOdbxUg1zk And keep ya cup, we drink whole bottles and cuss at niggas Like fuck that nigga, I let my pump subtract niggas While that is my favorite line of that song, it is notable to mention that the cadence of the previous rhyme* was so flow that Mikkey used it on Wayne's Shine Remix. **** However, it is the chorus that makes this song so great, in that the \"refrain\" is never actually refrained. While the intonation stays the same across all three \"choruses,\" each one has distinctive lyrics, thus making it not actually a refrain but another unique verse.I can't imagine that Weezy's goal was to make the audience rethink the construct that is the standard \"Pop Chorus\" but to keen listeners, he certainly did. Mr. Carter - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXfbD2DqeNM And next time you mention Pac, Biggie and Jay-Z, don't forget Weezy baby This track has all flavors of Wayne, from nonsensical rhyming references (\"And while they snooze we up / Feet up like a paraplegia\") to actual good flows (\"And I'm a go so opposite off soft / Off the richter, Comacho Man, Randy Savage / Far from average, above status quo\") and finally ending with the emotion-filled lines, \"At the funeral parlor dripping tears down my sleeve / Gimme any amount of time don't let Mrs. Carter grieve.\" Morever, this track is a great attempt by Wayne to get closer to the \"Best Rapper Alive\" shrine. Not only has he paired himself with the reigning King, Wayne actually out-performs him. Something that Weezy's previous cohorts could never do (case in point, Juvenile's Ha remix with Jay-Z**) Show Me What You Got (Freestyle) - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMhGLOI1poY I must be Lebron James if he's Jordan This is quite a public, albeit friendly, shot at Jay-Z. Not only is he calling himself \"The Best Rapper Alive,\" he is doing it over HOVA's beat, while referencing HOVA's own lyrics. Loud Pipes - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq24UBSZtd4With a classic Hot Boyz hook from Juvenile, this track runs the gamut of mid-90s Cash Money talent. And for once in his then early career, Wayne out did all his cronies.*** Honorable Mentions:Drop the World - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErCAOMi5EGMYes, this song is great. However, it remains only an honorable mention because Eminem's verse absolutely Murders (with a capital M) Lil Wayne's whole song. Also, the beat sounds like it was produced for T.I. Either way, epic song. Fuck Wit Me Now - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nEeNoq-bLA   Another track off Light's Out, I consider it Wayne's equivalent to Jay-Z's Nigga What, Nigga Who. Just an all-out 16th note blazing flow. Everything - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hbfg7jpTT_oI hate to give Weezy this much credit but I feel that if it wasn't for this song, Jay-Z would have never released Song Cry on The Blueprint. Everything tells an all-to-true story of Wayne losing his father. While the song still relates to \"the streets,\" this was his first departure from the Tha Block is Hot style rhymes about it. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------* \"I'm a young dog, wild and ecstatic, violent when passin\"** http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRZvemxAYAc*** While Lil Wayne was still \"lil\" (16 years old), no-named Lil Turk murdered him all over Cash Money's catalog, especially Juvenile's 400 Degreez. Case in point: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw0m1Uva4GM and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCiyMwcagq***** http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD1ZygCkxMg ",
