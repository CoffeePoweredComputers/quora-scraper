            "answer_text": "Yep. just watch sixteen, or his latest survival show, the NIZI project. he straight up told a 15 year old girl that she looked so pretty on stage that he like \u201ccouldn\u2019t focus\u201d. The girl looked straight up scared and super uncomfortable. Same girl, same. all of his music videos have some sexual references, and he literally smacks some girl\u2019s butt in one of them. Which is disturbing and the fact that I don\u2019t see a lot of people calling him out makes me realize how much power he has in the industry. the man is not only loaded, but has MILLIONS of connections. Basically if anyone tried to call him out, he could boot them out of the country, target their friends or family, or get them framed for something they didn\u2019t do. Worst of all he would get away with it, no consequences at all. He\u2019s that powerful in this industry. Random trainees or idols don\u2019t have a chance against him. So if he did anything to them. The public would have HIS back. And the idol/trainee\u2026. lets just say that they would have a rough time. if this isn\u2019t enough evidence for u then just watch Twice\u2019s Knock Knock or their other mv\u2019s, particularly with subtitles on if u can\u2019t understand otherwise. (Its suggestive, to say the least) or watch sixteen, or the nizi project, or even just watch a compilation of him interacting with female idols. and I\u2019m only saying this from what I know about him and FEMALE idols, I have NO IDEA about male trainees and idols\u2026. BUT IF HE HURT STRAY KIDS IN ANY WAY IM THROWIN HANDS that being said stan twice they r so precious and if I could I would protect them\ud83e\udd7a until the next rant~ ",
