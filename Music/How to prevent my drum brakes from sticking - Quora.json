            "answer_text": "All motor vehicles need occasion maintainance. Every moving part. Your rear drums are no exception. During use, the brake material is worn from the brake shoes and accumulates in the drum. The space between the brake shoes and the drum that they operate on, is very small, maybe only 30/1000 of an inch, and this will get clogged up with the brake dust, causing the drums to drag, or stick. Go to an auto shop and get a brake overhaul, which is lubricating the pistons, copper grease on the pins that hold the shoes, blow out all the brake dust, maybe new brake shoes and adjusting them. I do not think you will have any more problems, but it will help you to understand your car if you will read the manual that comes with the car, and stick to the service intervals. Youtube will show you what is needed, if you would like to do it yourself. ",
