            "answer_text": "This question is surprisingly difficult; First of all, Black Sabbath has many different lineups, resulting in an array of different nuances to their music, but I always default to the original lineup of Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward, so we are going with that era for the purposes of this question. Despite what many people may think, 3 Doors Down has a very different sound from Black Sabbath (At least, in the era I have chosen). Granted, I am far less familiar with the catalog of the former band than the latter, but I did cover \u201cLoser\u201d during my time as a solo performer. My knowledge of 3 Doors Down is that their music is very somber and introspective, whereas Black Sabbath is much more hard-edged and topical. Ultimately, I think that where you end up is with something that sounds a lot like Metallica during the Load/ReLoad era. There is not a lot else I can think of that really fits the parameters. I hope that this answer is satisfactory. ",
