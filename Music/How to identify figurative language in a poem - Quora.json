            "answer_text": "If it\u2019s a poem, it\u2019s probably using figurative language. Let\u2019s look at the first stanza of Keats, To Autumn Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness, Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun; Conspiring with him how to load and bless With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run; To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees, And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core; To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells With a sweet kernel; to set budding more, And still more, later flowers for the bees, Until they think warm days will never cease, For summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells. The first line is fairly literal, but in the second line we immediately have personification, which is extended throughout the poem. From here, everything is figurative, though it operates at additional levels and layers. Let\u2019s look at something more recent, The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock, by TS Eliot. Let us go then, you and I,When the evening is spread out against the skyLike a patient etherized upon a table;Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,The muttering retreatsOf restless nights in one-night cheap hotelsAnd sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:Streets that follow like a tedious argumentOf insidious intentTo lead you to an overwhelming question ...Oh, do not ask, \u201cWhat is it?\u201dLet us go and make our visit. Again, the first line is (in poetic terms at least) fairly literal. The second line is a metaphor\u2014the evening spread out. The third line is a simile, but a powerful and unexpected one. But, note, it is a simile of a metaphor. Now let\u2019s look at Britain\u2019s favourite poem, Sea Fever, by John Masefield. I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky,And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by;And the wheel\u2019s kick and the wind\u2019s song and the white sail\u2019s shaking,And a grey mist on the sea\u2019s face, and a grey dawn breaking. \u2018lonely sea\u2019 is a personification\u2014or is it? You can also read it as a transference: it is not the sea that is lonely, but the author when he is at sea. The third line is a low-level personification, but this is raised to a higher level when we are actually shown the \u2018sea\u2019s face\u2019.  In poetry, there are typically five or six forms of figurative language: Simile \u2014 at the most obvious level, and in a sense literal, \u2018x is like y\u2019.Metaphor \u2014 a metaphor is a simile without \u2018like\u2019. Instead of saying \u201cit\u2019s like a conspiracy\u201d,. Keats says, in line 3 of To Autumn, \u2018conspiring with him\u2026\u2019Personification \u2014 something inanimate is given human characteristics. Ruskin criticised this as \u2018The Pathetic Fallacy\u2019.[1] Ruskin was wrong.Symbol \u2014 something is used to represent something else without spelling it out. The \u2018patient etherized\u2019 in The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock is a symbol of Prufrock\u2019s own life. We only find this out later.Conceit \u2014 a conceit is an extended piece of figurative language. The whole of To Autumn is a conceit, treating the season of Autumn (Fall, for Americans) as a person.Subject \u2014 in a poem which has distinct subject and theme, the subject itself is figurative. The subject of \u2018To Autumn\u2019 is (obviously) Autumn, but the theme is nostalgia. This is the sense in which most poetry \u2014 beyond the simplest form of narrative verse \u2014 is figurative. It may be talking about one thing, but what it means is something else. For example, in The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock, Prufrock\u2019s indecision is itself a marker of the collapse of male confidence in modern life. It would be saying too much to call it a \u2018symbol\u2019.Footnotes[1] Of the pathetic fallacy by John Ruskin (1856)",
