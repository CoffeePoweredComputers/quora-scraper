            "answer_text": "Oooooh this is a tough one. In terms of most influential rappers, most skilled, most creative and unique rappers, this is definitely a heavyweight world title matchup. And one that ends in a Wayne victory, but only by a slim margin. (Tldr below but please take a few to read) \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Blue Corner, from Detroit, MI : Eminem (Slim Shady, Marshall Mathers) Eminem is obviously technically skilled. Everyone knows this. Slim's ability to chop up, vary his flow, vary his tempo, and play with rhyme schemes earns him a 10/10 in skill factor. Eminem is also an amazing songwriter. Songs like Stan, Lose Yourself and Cleanin Out My Closet are nothing short of timeless classics (to name only a few well known songs) His lyrics are (or more accurately were) stupidly unique and challenging and for that, the exact definition of ART in my opinion. 10/10 for songwriting/ability to make good songs. Eminem also completely changed what the world thought a rapper could be. A white trash dude with blonde hair, a nasally voice, who raps horrorcore themes?? Are you kidding? At the turn of the century he was completely against the grain. People thought Dr. Dre was committing career suicide by riding with this dude and then he goes multi platinum. 9.5/10 for influence Eminem has sold more hard copies than most pop artists. No one i know doesn't know Eminem. Enough said. 11/10 for success.  Red Corner, from Hollygrove, LA: Lil Wayne Weezy is probably one of the most looked over musicians the world has ever known in terms of pure talent and skill. People (specifically casual rap consumers and\u2026 looking at you hip hop Quora) hear the typically slower flow, the sometimes autotuned vocals, and the often crackly delivery that is Lil Wayne rapping and assume he's not as good as, Eminem, for example. Wayne rarely uses a \u201cchopper flow.\u201d (Rap God has a legendary chopper flow, Tech N9ne, Busta and Twista all use chopper flows). Wayne instead uses flows that bounce and ride, or \u201cgo.\u201d His style was bitten SO HARD throughout the peak of YMCMB that his INSANELY unique voice and unmistakable charisma, was the only way you knew it was Wayne, not insert name of 90% of post 2006 rappers. His style is in fact the ultimate evolution of rap music because he does not use the chopped up, fun to for the whole family to sing along to flows or chopper flows. Instead, Lil Wayne mastered, and I mean down-to-1/16th-notes-mastered, the art of a slow flow. Lil Wayne also mastered, prolifically, the art of SYNCOPATION - picking up, in my opinion, where Jay Z left off. Everyone knows Lil Wayne got bars and metaphors. Every one knows how he comes up with them on the spot in the booth. But few people outside of other successful rappers seem to notice his bizzarely insane mastery of flow and cadence, and the way that mastery literally hacked the minds of every rapper to follow. 11/10 for skill. Dont argue me on this. You're wrong. Lil Wayne is also a great songwriter. \u201cWait didn't he make the songs Gonorrhea and Lollipop how is that good songwriting?\u201d Because he, like Eminem, redesigned what a rapper could be to the world in many ways, one of which was LYRICAL CONTENT. Lil Wayne is forever one of the black sheeps of the rap game because he introduced us to pure bars that sometimes had no purpose and followed no narrative\u2026. other than you would have to think about what he just said for 4 more bars before realizing it was a triple entendre. Lil Wayne transcended what rap lyrics were. It's fun, it's pure energy. Lil Wayne can make deep or political songs, like Stan, of course (Tie My Hands, Georgia Bush, Sky Is The Limit) but he does so in a completely unique and CHALLENGING way, combining southern hip hop, with his neighborhood, and the classic knife-edge quality you find in New York/East Coast Beast Coast style rap. That is art. All inoffensive or basic rap lyrics are pop lyrics. Change my mind. 10/10 songwriting. I already touched a little on influence, but i didn't mention Mixtapes. Lil Wayne virtually invented the mixtape as we know it today. While the standard way to release songs was singles, promotionals, and an album or EP, Lil Wayne gave his fans ENTIRE ALBUMS FOR FREE leading up to the \u201cactual\u201d album. His body of work and output at the height of his stardom in the mid late 2000s and early 2010s is astonishing. His work ethic is the mantra most rappers live by today. In addition he birthed YMCMB which fostered several of Rap music's most successful artists of all time in Drake and Nicki Minaj. 10.5/10 influence. Lil Wayne is also in the top 10 of highest selling rappers of all time. He has managed to stay utterly respected, and relevant, for over a decade. Here he is, in 2019, still headlining (as is Eminem). In the rap game that is unheard of. 10/10 success.  Both are straight superstar quality excellent performers. We'll give them each a 10/10 and save the breakdown.  Scorecard: Eminem : 50.5 pts Lil Wayne : 51.5 pts  To answer this question or to understand an answer to it, you have to look at both rappers objectively. And objectively, Lil Wayne pushes the envelope in every way shape and form. He can use a chopper flow, i have no doubt he could rap as fast as Em on Rap God, but he rarely goes to that place. Why? : TLDR Because instead of focusing on talents that can simply be practiced and perfected by anyone (youtube \u201crap god no mistakes\u201d\u2026.see what i mean?) Lil Wayne made his charisma, his creativity, his INTANGIBLE assets, the main focus of his career and artistry. Every one who has ever rapped knows and will tell you that the chopper flow only goes so far, and that shocking lyrics only go so far. Lil Wayne never once had to rely on shock value. To listen to Lil Wayne and acknowledge his punchlines and \u201cbars\u201d is only the surface. Eminem feels like he simply practiced rapping until he was the best. Like an athlete. This doesn't make him less of a rapper, just different. Wayne sounds like he skated out of his mother's womb freestyling with a styrofoam cup in his hand. Like\u2026.Lil Wayne I guess. (Or a Rap God ;)) Simply put, Lil Wayne just reaches further than any other rapper ever has into places no rapper had the patience, DEDICATION, or balls to reach into. That is why he is the better rapper. ******* I love both artists and i absolutely hate comparing but this comparison was too juicy to pass up. ",

            "answer_text": "Eminem not by far like most. How do we know that for sure? Lil Wayne said Eminem was better, \u201cem I would call you out but I can't f*ck with you\u201d and lil Wayne on the air begged eminem to do an album with him. Remember no love etc em and lil Wayne did together plus a few other songs ,lil Wayne was even amazed when they did a song together on SNL . I like lil Wayne too, he reminds me of drake raps about the same stuff every song and people have the nerves to talk about Eminem. Em could take the easy way out and be like everybody else same stuff every song. I remember Drake's last album people were talking about how great it was which it was but of course Eminem ended up out doing him..the whole albums was features and girls . same as people saying rakim is better than Eminem. Rakim even said, \u201cif Eminem was black he would be the Ali of rap\u201d. What is that telling you? What was Ali to boxing? list goes on and on. I guess haters going hate lol. ",
