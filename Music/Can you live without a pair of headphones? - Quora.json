            "answer_text": "Sure, though I\u2019ve accumulated a surprising number of headphones over the years. It was largely from needing to use them in radio broadcast, where the models available in many studios were pretty bad, so I brought my own. They were necessary there to hear when you were cueing up a track while still speaking into the microphones, or to hear from anyone else in the control room while also live on the air at the time. These days I mostly use them during air travel or when I want to hear a radio program or podcast or music where the sound might bother a family member or anyone else nearby if I\u2019m outdoors. Live without them? Sure. But enjoy them, yeah, since I\u2019ve got them. ",

            "answer_text": "For most people, headphones are just a convenience item. However, for people who work in the broadcast industry, headphones are important tools that they need to do their jobs. Radio DJs and board operators need headphones because the speakers in the control room automatically mute when the microphone is open. This is necessary to prevent feedback. Headphones allow the person on the air to hear him or herself, other things that are going out over the air, and communications from people elsewhere in the studio (this is called talk-back, and it is like an intercom). People who spend a great deal of time working in radio studios often buy their own headphones because they want something that will feel comfortable to wear for an entire shift. Guests and remote talent (such as sportscasters) on the radio also wear headphones. The headphones allow them to hear themselves on the air, as well as cues from the board operator (the board operator might say something like, \u201cwe\u2019re going to air in 30 seconds\u201d). ",

            "answer_text": "Of course, it is not an essential to my continued survival and I have in the past gone without headphones for periods of time. Often these periods are unintentional side effects of not having a working pair of headphones and being in the process of deciding what new pair to buy yet during the process it will often feel almost voluntary as I know that subjecting myself to this is good for me and means that I will only appreciate the kick arse new pair I will inevitable be buying even more. Hope this helps ",

            "answer_text": "Good question. Can you live without a cellphone? Or would you like to go back to the days that people sharing only one telephone at the telephone booth? Probably not. Technology developed to change our lives, making it more convenient and easier. If headphones are only designed for listening to music, maybe we can live without them, cause there are so many audio devices for music and headphone is just one of them. But today headphones are not just for listening to music, they can help to reduce the outside noise(the noise-cancelling feature) and ease your mind. ",
