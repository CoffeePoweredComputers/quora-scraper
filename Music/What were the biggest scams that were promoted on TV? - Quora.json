            "answer_text": "Scam is such a harsh word, and it may not be entirely accurate However, if you watched infomercials in Toronto, you probably saw one for this place  This is One King Street West. It was built as an office building many decades ago and was once the headquarters of the Bank of Toronto. In it`s basement is the largest vault in Canada and one of the most secure in the world. However, the Bank of Toronto merged with a couple of other bank. It`s now TD Canada Trust and it`s headquarters are over at Bay and King one block west. So someone came up with the idea of turning this into a condo. Not a terrible idea - there is very little residential space in Toronto`s financial district and people like living near downtown now. But it`s an expensive piece of real estate, so how to convince people to buy a unit. Simple, you convince them that it`s an investment. You open a condo hotel combination and you convince people they can put a small amount of money down and use the income from the rentals to cover the carrying costs. And, to be fair, this has worked elsewhere. The Shangri-La, over on University Avenue, is a successful hotel condo, but it`s also brand new. One King West wasn`t successful. First, the city assessed all the units at the hotel rate and not the condo rate. That meant taxes were about triple what was expected. The people who bought a unit to live in rather than rent out complained, but it did put the whole financial aspect up in the air. Second, it cost a lot more to renovate the building than expected. Not surprising for a decades old building that needed a lot more plumbing and HVAC work, but there you go. As such, the creditors came swooping down on it and it soon went into receivership. The hotel section was never profitable and there are a lot of lawsuits. ",
