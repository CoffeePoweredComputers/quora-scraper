            "answer_text": "My dad once told me a story about Elvis Presley. It was that one day, Elvis was at a market or shopping center and saw an old black woman struggling to carry groceries. Elvis went to help the woman carry them to wherever she needed. The woman didn't have a car, and needed to carry them all the way back to her house. Elvis did just that. Afterwards he even bought her a brand new car so she didn't have to walk back and forth the get groceries. To answer the question, no Elvis was not racist. \"Cough Cough\" Thank you \"Cough Cough\" ",

            "answer_text": "No, that was a false rumor. Elvis was a good person. He had a heart of gold. He admired and he respected black artists. He was rumored to have said that \u201c all nigers can do for me is polish my shoes and buy my records\u201d. He never said that. He said \u201ci would never say anything like that and everyone who knows me knows that\u201d. Elvis may have had weaknesses and may have been troubled but he was a genuinely good person, an insanely talented artist who happened to have become extremely rich and famous, while still young. As is almost always the case with superstars he was surrounded by mean spirited people. Elvis Presley was not racist.RIP Elvis. ",
