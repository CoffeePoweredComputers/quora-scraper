            "answer_text": "Not song, but the whole album. It\u2019s a compilation album called Beach House that a friend bought me from a souvenir shop display about 15 years ago. It\u2019s almost impossible to find because I think it was a compilation made just for souvenir stores. I\u2019ll have a link to the track listing below, but note that even though some of the tracks appear on other albums, they may be different edits and sound different. It can be described as easy listening or smooth jazz or chill. I listen to it on my daily commute and have done so for about a decade. Since my commute is about 25 to 35 minutes, that means I have heard it about 2500 times. This music is perfect is perfect for my commute. I ride a motorcycle and listening to music keeps me sane. When I started this commute, I was listening to heavy metal but that made me an aggressive rider, something that doesn\u2019t make for a long life span for a motorcyclist. So I started listening to chill out music. That was good, but many of the songs had quiet parts that I couldn\u2019t hear while riding. I didn\u2019t want to turn it up too loud, otherwise the loud parts would be too loud. I needed something that was at a fairly even volume all the way through. Enter the Beach House album, which was already a part of my Chill Out playlist on my iPod Nano (remember them?). Over the years I have never become bored with it. Strangely enough, there\u2019s always something new to hear in it. The songs are beautifully crafted with many subtle parts. Sometimes I don\u2019t hear it, sometimes I may have another song in my head, but it\u2019s always there as the background for my ride. Put this on repeat in my coffin. Various - Beach House ",

            "answer_text": "There are two: Nutshell by Alice In Chains  *on the Jar of flies album Out of all the songs I've listen to throughout my life, only one other leaves me with as much of an emotional high as this one. Layne\u2019s vocals and Jerry\u2019s guitar work blend into something that is pure beauty. Sure, the vocals are depressing, but they feel so genuine. Layne conveys his sense of being lost in life perfectly in this song, and as a result, speaks to millions of others who feel the same way he did. His part alone is fantastic. I'd probably get goosebumps by listening to it separately. Jerry\u2019s work is impeccable too. The chord sequence at the beginning of the song is something that is instantly recognizable to any AIC fan, and it sets the mood perfectly. His outro solo is one of the most beautiful ever(IMO of course). It never fails to send chills down my spine. There have been times were I've danced all along my bedroom to this song for hours. I highly recommend this song to anyone who appreciates absolute beauty. RIP Layne Stayley And the other one\u2026 Wet Sand by the great RHCP  I can't say enough about this one. The lyrics are beautiful, Flea\u2019s bass line is incredible, and Frusciante\u2019s outro solo is my personal favorite solo of all time. Everything builds up to the absolutely epic bridge with the awesome chord progression of E,F#m, and G#m. Again, John\u2019s outro solo is\u2026orgasmic( and that's an understatement) The \u201cWet Sand\u201d that is the title of the song is supposedly about going against society's expectation of settling down into a life of comfort and instead exploring your\u201ddark\u201d and adventurous side. By doing that, you have a greater chance of making an impact on the world that reaches beyond your lifespan. He(Anthony) knows that he will eventually be somewhat forgotten, but he's proud that his work has influenced people and will probably impact future generations. Thus, he's leaving a mark on the wet sand that is life, a small but still impactful point. My friends tease me about this song because I always start dancing to it regardless of where I am. I can't help it, it's the best song ever. ",
