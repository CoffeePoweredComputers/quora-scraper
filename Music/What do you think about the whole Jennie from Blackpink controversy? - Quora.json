            "answer_text": "Jennie is my bias wrecker in BlackPink. She\u2019s awesome and gorgeous and just amazing in general, but I can\u2019t defend something that is this clear: debut Jennie and 2018 Jennie are not the same. After watching the side by side comparison of her during debut and now, even a terrible dancer like myself can see that Jennie is slacking off. Us Blinks don\u2019t know the reason for this, but Jennie is slacking off in everything from stage presence to dancing power to facial expressions to just overall energy. Some people defend her saying \u201cshe\u2019s tired\u201d but Lisa has been doing just as much outside work and she still gives it her all. Another thing to address is favoritism. Jennie is quite obviously YG\u2019s favorite and she is the most prioritized out of BlackPink. She frequently wears the only different colors and her outfits are more expensive and lavish than the other three members, and she has a disproportionate amount of lines and screen times in MV\u2019s. Why don\u2019t the other members get some shining time too? My bias Jisoo was perhaps the worst dancer in the group during debut but she worked hard to improve and is now much better than she used to be. Ros\u00e9 has awesome vocals and is a true asset to the team, and no one could deny Lisa\u2019s stage presence and dancing skills. These three members have worked just as hard, if not harder, then Jennie, but Jennie is the only one to wear a white outfit compared to the other three\u2019s black in many concerts. It\u2019s almost as if BlackPink is now \u201cJennie and the Girls\u201d. Although Jennie is amazing, YG seriously needs to give all the members equal shining time so that the group feels like BlackPink. I could be wrong, but I assume that a major factor in Jennie\u2019s recent laziness is because the importance YG has put in her has gone to her head. This can be quite apparent if you compare her performances in SOLO to BlackPink songs like AIIYL and Boombayah. In SOLO, the spotlight is all on her and so she shines in the spotlight, dancing with her vibrant energy as she used to in BP. I really hope Jennie, whatever her reason for this, smartens up and pulls her act together. It\u2019s not fair to Ros\u00e9, Lisa, and Jisoo to have worked so hard and tirelessly performed their songs over and over again to treat Blinks while Jennie gets away with lazy dancing and extra emphasis because of YG\u2019s favoritism and quite possibly her ego. I am not a hater of Blackpink. I do however see the truth and wish that for the benefit of BlackPink and Blinks, Jennie gets going again and that YG would stop showing so much favoritism to any one member. Thanks for the request Isabel:) ",

            "answer_text": "Jennie is my bias and I absolutely love her. She loves her fans and they all love her. But just cause she\u2019s my bias doesn\u2019t mean i won\u2019t tell the truth. Debut Jennie is very different then the new Jennie. She was active in dances and sang the songs. BlackPink also showed up & showed out for their performances but now it\u2019s not the same. Since SOLO came out, Jennie has been getting hella attention but she had hella attention before too. For a while now, Jennie has been very lazy during performances; she doesn\u2019t do the dances with energy, she looks bored and she barely sings/lipsing. I honestly agree with people who say she\u2019s acting lazy. Some blinks are saying that she\u2019s just tired but at the end of the day, the other members are tired too but they give it a hundred percent no matter how tired they are. Fans are paying their money to go and see them so ALL of them need to put in effort no matter what. She\u2019s really great as a model but as a performer, I don\u2019t know. She looks like she doesn\u2019t have fun doing it. She loves her fans a lot though so I give her the benefit of the doubt. Jennie is spoiled when it comes to YG, she\u2019s the princess. Her getting the first Solo was a marketing strategy because she is the biggest/known member so of course. They honestly should\u2019ve never done that, as the main singer Ros\u00e9 should\u2019ve received it. Also with YG deleting the videos of her getting criticized by fans & others, it makes it look even worse. But I do agree that some of the videos were just being used a gateway to hate on her. All fo At at the end of the day, I hope YG & Jennie takes this controversy and learns from it. As a performer, this is your job. Yes, you may be tired but with how many shows & combacks they have, they are well rested compared to most groups in the KPop community. thank you for coming to my ted talk :) ",
