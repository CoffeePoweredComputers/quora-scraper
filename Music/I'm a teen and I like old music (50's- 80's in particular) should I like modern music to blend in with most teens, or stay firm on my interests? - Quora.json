            "answer_text": "You should firm on your interest as long as you can but some people change their music paths as they get older. But I had the same question because I listen to heavy metal and its subgenres some classical music. But I have listened to heavy metal since nine years old and I am fourteen now I wonder if it's just a phase (emo phase but I don\u2019t dress or act anywhere near it) I just enjoy the lyrical content in it and the noise it produces I enjoy it. It sounds satisfying to me when it sounds nice or if I get goosebumps from it. But after all this, I wonder if its just teenager anger or will I enjoy this music as an adult or will I change. When I listen to it at school people say how can you listen to this it's giving me a headache. I listen to bands like Breaking Benjamin, Korn, Starset, Slipknot, Downplay. I don\u2019t even like modern pop bands or rap. I think you should stay its different from the rest of the genres. Continue your path in the snow. That's cool that you enjoy that genre your different from the rest but I sure there is another teenager that likes your genre. I am proud of my music taste you should too. Listen to other genres to just don\u2019t stick to it there could be the other genre you like more. ",

            "answer_text": "My advice to you is to not automatically close yourself to any genre or time period of music.  Good music can be found anywhere.  There was a time where I never thought I would enjoy classical or country music or blues, or groups like Metallica or Megadeth or System of a Down.  But after listening to them I changed my mind.  This doesn't mean I like everything in these genres or by these artists.  The point is, you may be missing the best song you will ever hear because it is something you never thought you would like.  This advice also works with things like food, and human beings you may want to befriend.  Give it a try with no strings attached.  If you don't like it move on with your life.   You don't need to make believe you like something that you do not, just to get along with others.   At the same time, don't go around saying how crappy the music you don't prefer is.  It's not a competition.  There is no reason you can't get along with other teens that prefer other music.   ",
