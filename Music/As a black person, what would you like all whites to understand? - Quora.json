            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t speak for all black Americans, but I can tell you what I want\u2014an authentic connection. I want you to understand my experience. I want white Americans to ask hard questions and not judge me when I give you the hard truth. I want you to attempt to see the world as I do. I want to be seen as a whole person, not a generalization or a stereotype. I am an individual, not the entire black collective or the black criminal you saw on the news the night before. Judge me by my accomplishments, achievements, actions, behavior, and deeds not simply because I am black. Therefore, I must fit some negative stereotypes to be used against me as a \u201cman\u201d. I want you to see and understand how discrimination harms us all as a nation. Instead of lecturing me about personal responsibility or seeking acknowledgment that some aspect of black culture is responsible for anti-black racism or \u201cliving on the democratic plantation\u201d. In my opinion, you are racist hiding behind the cloak of conservatism. I want you to embrace our cultural differences rather than merely tolerate them. I want to be able to connect with you as someone who is both different and the same. I never mention \u201cwhite privilege\u201d because I live in the comfortable bubble of \u201cclass privilege\u201d. My affluence and wealth give me privileges that the large majority of black or white people do not come close to having. Being a tall, light caramel-skinned man, with hazel/green eyes, slim nose, wavy hair, or \u201cgood hair\u201d, gives me privilege in the black community based on colorism and within the white community because my ambiguous features are seen as less threatening. I don\u2019t appear as the \u201cbig, black brute\u201d ready to cause mayhem and violence. Poor, uneducated white Americans suffer in America, white Americans with mental health issues suffer in America, white Americans with developmental disabilities suffer in America, black and white women continue to suffer in the workplace in America, and the list can go on. I am speaking specifically to white Americans not \u201cwhite people\u201d. Black and White Americans can learn to understand each other with patience, effort, and empathy. It\u2019s not easy but it\u2019s worth it. White people alone is too broad of a term to use. Example: The discrimination of Eastern and Southern Europeans by Western Europeans(e.g. the English, French, and German), all of which are ironically the same people who enslaved/oppressed black people too. My last name \u201cFaulkner\u201d is of English/German origin. This is the Faulkner coat of arms, family crest form England. Credit Google.  Slavic people are still looked down upon in Europe, still used as cheap labor, dismissed, and ridiculed. Many Slavic people were killed during WWI and WWII. They are the ancestors of many white Americans who live in America today. Your experiences are not less valuable than my own. Diversity is inclusive of all white Americans, including white heterosexual men. Ben Franklin was president of the Anti-Slavery Society. Many white Americans are at the forefront of societal change to eliminate oppression and increase equity. I personally want you to know that I appreciate the white men and women who join us in speaking out against injustice and inequity. Thanks for reading. ",

            "answer_text": "You have no idea what it's like to be black in America. It doesn't matter if you're married to a black person. It doesn't matter if you've lived in black neighborhoods your whole life. If you aren't black you will never be able to understand what it feels like. Just like I'll never know what it feels like to be white, Asian, Hispanic or anything else. There are some, not all, white people who operate under the belief that racism no longer exists in America, or that it's overblown and exaggerated. Denial perpetuates racism and bigotry. And that belief precludes you from participating in the conversation and being taken seriously. You exist in a bubble of protection and privilege. So stay in it and enjoy it. Stop trying to explain racism to us. Don't talk to us about what Republicans or Democrats have done or not done for African Americans. Racism doesn't start and end with politics. All the policies in the world don't change the most basic and fundamental fact about racism--It's evil. Plain and simple. If you support and defend someone who has engaged in racism, in any aspect of your life, you have supported and defended evil. That makes you a part of the problem and therefore an enemy to people who have to live with racism everyday of the week, everyday of our lives. To all the white people who have tried to empathize, fight and stand with us; your efforts are appreciated. To all the white people who have tried to dehumanize, brutalize and maintain your mistaken belief that you are superior to us based solely on the color of your skin, you can all kiss our asses. ",

I hate people who look for excuses. I hate people that confuse silence with peace. I'm sick of arguing with people who argue that institutionalized racism must be De Jure, and that if it isn't then it's not racism. For example I'm tired of arguing with people that the war end drugs is racist. It was created to be a weapon used against black people and to this day affects black people the most. People love to argue \u201cBut that's not true! Police just target poor people and they happen to be black\" but they won't admit profiling occurs in rich neighborhoods, or how innocent black men are 12 times more likely to be exonerated for drug crimes, or how there is a disproportionate sentencing (28 grams of crack results in the same minimum amount of jail time as 280 cocaine). It's just hard now. So many people see a problem that isn't affecting them personally and they just walk away or deny it exists. So many people will condemn men for their pasts but then claim innocent until proven guilty. So many people just want order instead of Justice\u2026 And it shows. I mean I stumbled across this video of Dizze speaking about how he perceives poverty in America vs poverty in the U.K. There are a few things that he says that straight up make me want to cry, not as a black man but as a human: I've been to areas in this country [America] that are f**k'n I can't believe it's America for a start, it's like third worldI've never even seen this kind of poverty beforeThe poverty I've seen here [America] is madness, the lack of empathy and how crazy this country is\u2026 I thought I knew. Sometimes I wonder if there is hope for America. Sometimes I doubt if there's anything worth fighting for because there are so many people who just don't care enough to help end suffering. ",

Case in point\u2026blm\u2026i have a surprise for yall even white folks get screwed over by the police die at the hands of police\u2026and we are tired of it too. had you chosen to be inclusive you would have a LOT more support and isnt that what you want? its time to get rid of black african american whatever labels and be MEN and WOMEN imagine innocent man choked to death by crooked police officer while his trainees watch. Theres no need to play the race card but the media has hijacked your mantra time to stop them\u2026.you want equality and so do I but you cant hold yourself forth as different and be equal\u2026the whole seperate but equal thing failed long ago. That brings me to the end\u2026everytime you see black or african american substitute separate but equal and see how the light starts to shine on whats wrong\u2026.thanks for letting me into your life for a few minutes and god bless ya.

Who? Privileges and entitlement fuels racism and it\u2019s the white male who\u2019s the puppet that can end racism through equality. Once the white male breaks his programming and realizes he has been hoodwinked to be a puppet, then he needs create equality or equal access for everyone. Nothing is by chance but by design; and no one is born with inalienable rights. whites are not blacks people\u2019s problem but they don\u2019t know that. Blacks are not white peoples problem. The puppet master are the elite. why do you think you pay $70,000/ year for college?! Go on YouTube. Listen to anything with James Baldwin, Tim Wise and Jane Elliott.  ",
