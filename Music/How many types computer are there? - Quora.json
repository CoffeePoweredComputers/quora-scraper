            "answer_text": "Depending on the ways the data can be handled computers are basically divided into three categories (A) Analog , (B) Digital and (C) Hybrid. But the Digital computers can be further categorised depending upon the purpose they do and based on their size and performance .  A.) Analog Computers : are those computers in which data or number is represented in the form of continuously varying physical quantities such as pressure , temperature , voltage current etc Analog computers measure things Application area : speedometer of a car , gasoline pump . B.) Digital computers : are those computers that solves the problems by operating on a discrete data (numeric data) representing variables by performing arithmetic and logical processes on a data from a stored program. Digital computers count things Application areas: Home , educational institutions , office , scientific fields , business etc , C.) Hybrid computers : are analog computers controlled by digital computers instead of human beings , Application area : Hospitals , Meteorology department etc. Types of Digital computers according to the purpose they are used 1.) Specific purpose computers : They are designed to do single specific task. The programs or instructions carry out the specific task are stored permanently in the machine . For example : computers used at the billing counters in mall , for military application purpose . 2.) General Purpose computers : They are designed to solve wide variety of problems having different set of inputs , For example : Computers for banking , sales analysis etc .. Types of digital computers according to the size and performance : 1.) Embedded systems : are designed to be used within the circuitry of appliances such as televisions , refrigerator , washing machine , bike etc. 2.) Micro computers : are designed to used by single user for performing basic operations like educational activities , playing games , They are mainly used in schools , homes , offices shops , etc . Further the micro computers can be classified into three basic categories . A) Personal Digital assistant , b.)Laptop , desktop , notebook , c.) workstations 3.)Mini computers : are more powerful than micro computers in terms of processing power and capabilities . They are generally multi user systems . 4.)Mainframe computers : are designed to handle large volumes of data and information , they are multi user and multi processor systems . 5.) Super computers: are designed to be used for doing extremely complicated computations that also in minimum possible time . They are fastest largest and most expensive digital computers available today . They are best in weather forecasting , nuclear science , Aerodynamic modelling . if u need more detailed answer means mail your questions to shardik585@yahoo.com ",

            "answer_text": "A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks. A \"complete\" computer including the hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment required and used for \"full\" operation can be referred to as a computer system. This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a computer network or computer cluster. Computers are used as control systems for a wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer-aided design, and also general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects hundreds of millions of other computers and their users. Early computers were only conceived as calculating devices. Since ancient times, simple manual devices like the abacus aided people in doing calculations. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century. The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II. The first semiconductor transistors in the late 1940s were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit (IC) chip technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s. The speed, power, and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with MOS transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace (as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the Digital Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries. Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing unit (CPU) in the form of a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) microprocessor, along with some type of computer memory, typically MOS semiconductor memory chips. The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information. Peripheral devices include input devices (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.), output devices (monitor screens, printers, etc.), and input/output devices that perform both functions (e.g., the 2000s-era touchscreen). Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source and they enable the result of operations to be saved and retrieved. ",
