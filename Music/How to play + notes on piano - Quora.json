            "answer_text": "It is not clear what is the context of this \u201c+\u201d. Does it have something to do with a music interval or a chord? If it is an interval or a chord, then it means the interval or chord is augmented. For interval, it is one half step higher than a major or perfect interval. For example a \u201c+4 \u201c can be from C to F#. An Augmented chord has the 5th of the chord half a step higher than a major chord; e.g. C,E, G# for C augmented chord, abbreviated as C+ It is also possible this sign has to do with a Baroque ornamentation. A trill or a passing tone is sometimes indicated by a \u201c+\u201d sign. If it is ornamentation, then the fragment of music that includes this sign needs to be seen in order to know what notes might be played. ",

            "answer_text": "The piano notes are named using the first 7 letters of the alphabet: A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. This pattern then repeats over and over across the keyboard. We will think of the note C as our starting point, since it's the first note of each 12-note pattern. Most modern pianos have a row of 88 black and white keys, 52 white keys for the notes of the C major scale (C, D, E, F, G, A and B) and 36 shorter black keys, which are raised above the white keys, and set further back on the keyboard.
