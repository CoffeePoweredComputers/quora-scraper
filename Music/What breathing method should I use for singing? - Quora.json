            "answer_text": "In my view, there are really only two methods of breath control. I call them compression and suspension.  In both, the inhalation is identical. Stand tall, with an open chest, and open the back of the throat with a yawn as you inhale. Take the air as low into the body as you possibly can. When I breathe in, I feel my back, side and abdomen expand. If I'm really open I can feel the breath through my groin and sphincter muscles, but that would be a very deep breath.  Now, the two methods. Contraction:  through this method you will reverse the outward movement of your body and begin to pull in on your abdominal, back and side muscles while pronating. Tone can last as long as you are able to squeeze air from your body.  Many young singers use this method, because, it somehow makes sense to them. If you squeeze a balloon, the air moves at a faster an louder rate than in a balloon left to deflate on its own.   Pros for this method are that it creates a bigger sound sooner in you vocal development and that it can increase your resonance. Cons include more fatigue in the voice, a tendency to push the sound, pitch sharpness, and a likelyhood of vocal strain.  With suspension, the inhalation is identical, but when the breath is engaged, the body walls continue to remain expanded. You physically do not allow your body to collapse. This take time and a great deal of practice to be able to do. Remember, you are teaching muscles, and eventually you will develop a muscle memory so you won't have to think about it as much.  Once you are singing using the suspension method, you will begin to find that part of it is counter intuitive. For example, if you were to sing an ascending passage it would make sense to pull in on the abdominal walls you move more air. In compression this would be correct. With suspension, you would push out on the abdominal walls as the pitch ascends. This allows the throat to remain open and free as the sound is expressed.  Almost all of my teachers have espoused the suspension technique, and all have different variations on how it is used. Ultimately, it's your body that you have to adapt to your singing technique, whichever you choose or learn. Just remember, breathe deep and disconnect the throat from your singing. It will come into play later in your development.  Good luck.   ",
