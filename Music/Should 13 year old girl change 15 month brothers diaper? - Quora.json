            "answer_text": "Why not? Of course she should if she wants to do that. It could be educational and responsible. Why would you not allow that. I can tell you my oldest daughter helped change diapers on her siblings from she was about 8 years old.. It made her protective of her siblings, she learned responsability and felt she was a responsible part of the family. She was also babysitting from early age, first while we as parents where home and could superwise it and later on for a few hours alone and eventually when was about 14-15 she could babysit alone over night in the house from time to time.. Today, she is 36 and a mom herself and she often thanks us as parents for letting her do that as she grew up and learn.. She is a great mom today to 2 boys and nothing came as a surprise to her as her own boys grew up as babies.. The boys are now 10 and 12..great kids all of them.. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d Our second daughter didn't get the chance sadly as we didn't have any more babies when she got older.. But she turned out great as well.. Now being 28 and also a mom of 2.. A boy and a girl aged 5 and 2.. And she let her boy of 5 be a part of taking care of his little sister.. He has grown very protective and tolerant towards her and always looks out for her best.. Bless the little guy \ud83d\ude0d ",

            "answer_text": "Assuming they are a typical 13-year-old, then sure. There are even kids who are younger than 13 who change diapers, especially if they have siblings who are babies. It\u2019s a pretty easy skill once you get the hang of it. If it\u2019s you who has to change the diaper, just make sure to wash your hands afterward. ",
