            "answer_text": "For me it is not rare. Just recently I experienced goosebumps playing a favourite CD in my car stereo. I had tickets to see the movie \u201cLive Baby Live\u201d. It was a remastered film of the INXS concert at Wembley stadium in 1991 with a crowd of nearly 74,000 people. Before the night at the cinema, going for drive one day, I was in the mood to listen to an INXS CD which I hadn't played for a long time. When the first track started playing, and of course it was nice and loud, I just got goosebumps and all the hairs on my arms were standing on ends. This happened for every song on the album. The feeling of goosebumps just adds to the enjoyment of listening to music that you love. When the night of seeing the concert at the cinema arrived, I met up with my sister who is also an INXS fan and we went in to experience a unique feeling of almost being in the crowd. We absolutely loved it. It wasn't as loud as being there but it was enough to give me goosebumps again and even a bit emotional for reliving seeing one of my favourite bands again. ",
