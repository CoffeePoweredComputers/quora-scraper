            "answer_text": "I never \u201chear\u201d the words. For me it is all about the rhythm, melody, beat, cadence, tempo and all the rest of that audiophile mumbo-jumbo. I am shocked sometimes when I Google the lyrics of songs I loved when I was a teenager. It is like I am hearing the song again for the first time years later and am awestruck that \u201cI figured it out\u201d what the hell they were singing about! For example I thought Self-Esteem by The OffSpring was a guy singing about how small he thought his pecker was (Freudian personal hidden teenage boy issue? LOL). It wasn\u2019t till years later I read the lyrics and realized it was all about some girl in the singers life that was using him just for sex and whatnot. hahahahah I\u2019m more of a plumber than a neurosurgeon but I will take a stab at what I think the discrepancy is for people like you and I who do not \u201chear\u201d words of songs. Mathematics It\u2019s no secret that people that are mathematically inclined tend to be on the nerdy end of the uber coolness spectrum. Mathematics is rigid and structured that have bounds and laws. Which is exactly what the sound of music is. It could definitely be the case that if Mozart or Beethoven were not introduced to music they would have been phenomenal mathematicians. It is truly astounding how similar music is to mathematics and how each medium are inextricably linked. So if you love math, are a bit awkward in social settings, can count to 20 without taking your shoes and socks off then you are perhaps more adept to music than words. Polyglots It aggravates me when I meet a foreigner that speaks 4 or more languages and they ask, \u201cHow many languages can you speak?\u201d Me: \u201cummmm\u2026. I speak good English\u2026 that\u2019s it.\u201d Foreigner: \u201cahhahah my poor illiterate country bumpkin \u2026 It is I speak English well not I speak good English.\u201d They laugh. I plot to overthrow whatever sophisticated society they emanate from. Though the fact remains a great many people are great at the spoken word. Linguistics in general it appears to me is somewhat easy for the greater population of the world. This ability to easily pick out a slight intonation from a spoken phrase seems common. Not me. An intonation has to vary DRASTICALLY for me to give any notice. Like when my girlfriend is droning on and on about some boring event that happened with her and her friends I usually just turn off the brain and cruise through some TV channels. Until she stops speaking. I look at her and she says, \u201cDid you not hear my question.\u201d Me: \u201cummm\u2026 there was a question?\u201d Girlfriend: \u201cYes I asked you\u2026 TWICE. Did you not know I was asking you something?\u201d Apparently I missed the telltale upward inflection at the end of a sentence indicative of a spoken question. Me: \u201cummm\u2026 nope. Can you repeat the que\u2026. HEY THE GAME IS ON!!\u201d Like it or not linguistics is not my strong suit. Nor attention span to mundane conversations. Hear a mouse fart I have great hearing. It just seems to me that the part of the brain that deals with linguistics was either never developed when I was a fetus or it was re-written with more important matters like plumbing a toilet, leveling up on COD, or ogling a great pair of boobies. You can\u2019t say Mozart of Beethoven were not Boob guys they most definitely were. Just listen to their symphonies there are Boobs everywhere\u2026 well in my music listening mind anyway. ",

            "answer_text": "For me I find that the musical content is just always more appealing to me than the verbal part of a song. I have often sung inappropriate songs due to having never considered what the lyrics actually meant. I\u2019m more interested in creating a particular sound than trying to convey a message. The words are just sounds to me most of the time. Lyrics often taint beautiful tunes by politicising them and it sorta feels like the joke might be on me because I don\u2019t know what they are saying right away lol. Perhaps the purpose of lyrics is to make music less the domain of musicians (i.e. they add a non-musical skill requirement in order to properly interpret it - similarly to how a song can become popular due to its dance routine, another non-musical element)? It certainly makes it easier to market music to specific demographics if you can encode words into it. A catchy lyric can really sell a song. There are far more words than notes available and yet 99% of songs seem to contain the same few 100 words in slightly different orders. Having said all that, I love the idea of Beethoven writing \u201cooo baby\u201ds and \u201cdoo wop\u201ds into his opera. That would be as funny as what the choir sings during that scene in Deadpool 2. And, hypocritically, if I\u2019m performing a song properly (rather than just busking) I will ensure I understand the lyrics so I can perform the song appropriately. But I still don\u2019t really listen to them. I read them. They\u2019re words. They make more sense to me that way, (baby, ooo, yeah). I know far more people who are good at hearing lyrics than people who are good at hearing the chord progression and melody. I\u2019m definitely in the minority. ",
