            "answer_text": "I personally don't believe that there is a worst member in BTS. But I've got a feeling at some point someone is going to say \u2018Jin\u2019 as one of there answers. And I'd like to share my opinion about his talents. Do I believe he's talentless? No absolutely not. Vocals I will admit that in terms of his vocal sound, he isn't as appealing as the other members of the group to some people, however to me I quite enjoy it. It's soothing like honey and is unique in tone. He's also one of the members with the best stability when singing live, which isn't early with some of BTS\u2019s choreography. Another reason why it is so impressive is because Jin literally started out not knowing how to sing well at all. He was the only trainee member who had had any singing experience prior, however he worked his socks of for years to perfect his vocals, his vocal coach said \u201cRather than improving his voice, he completely changed it from when he first began.\u201d and she admitted that he was her best student to date (2017). He often stayed up till 3am practicing on his vocals, and it shows his hard work is paid off.  Dance Now, I do see that Jin isn't the best dancer in the group, but he ISNT a bad dancer. Far from it infact. I don't know why so many people make him out as if he can't dance at all or has two left feet. He's actually pretty talented for someone with zero experience, and he's alot better than me that's for sure. I believe he does lack of confidence when he performs but I believe that's because he can become stage shy, and the constant comparison to the other members that he gets from antis and fans is probably why he gets nervous. He can actually dance really well, if you look at most of there dance practices he knows the right moves and catches up with the members, he's just not as smooth.  ",

            "answer_text": "That depends. The worst at bad dancing? Definitely Hoseok  He just can't not dance well. Seriously, what's up with him? The worst at bad singing? Who else would it be other than Jungkook?  Can this dude not flex his vocals? Then there's the worst at not being a good contemporary dancer, alongside his phenomenal stage presence. Jimin!  No wonder people can't resist not being charmed by him. Let's not forget the world's worst at bad rapping\u2026 Yoongi!  There shouldn't be a place in this world for bad bad rappers. Also the worst at making variety shows boring, and the worst at being the worst visual\u2026 Seokjin  He can't even try being ugly for a second. Let's not forget the person most horrible at horrible stage presence, with his not non-memorable facial expressions Seriously Taehyung  Other than bringing in new fans and capturing the hearts again of current ones, his skills bring nothing. Also there's the person who is the worst at being the worst leader in existence\u2026 \u2026none other than Namjoon  He should really just stop being a good leader.  I know this is an old question, but I saw an opportunity, so I took it. I couldn't resist poking some fun. Credits of all images go to Pinterest. ",
