            "answer_text": "I have answered this question in \u201c Who is Paris Jackson's biological father.\u201d You can see my answer. I know that Paris is not Michael's biological child. Neither is she Debbie Rowe's biological child and if Lisa Marie Presley agreed to have the babies for Michael Jackson, she wasn't going to be LMP\u2019s either. Hence why Lisa Marie Presley refused to have surrogate children for MJ. How do I know because everyone in the Jackson family know. Michael Jackson told all his family except Katherine and Joseph Jackson until 2009. I was told personally by Michael Jackson who was Paris' father. And, he's who orchestrated it. Paris' father is fully Caucasian, blonde hair and blue eyes and her mother is mixed race. Half British. She can also sing and that's how Paris got her singing gift. However, Paris' biological father gave up his rights to being a father to Paris, he didn't have any sexual relation with the mother. He only gave Michael Jackson his sperm. He didn't pay for procedures. Michael did! Michael took care off and looked after Paris from birth by himself. The biological mother was there too, she gave Paris love. However, Michael Jackson wanted these babies to be all his! It was a bit selfish on his part but it was something he longed for and wanted to master. Michael Jackson just didn't want children ,he wanted the children from a love union between him and the woman he loved! Even if they were coming out of bodies he didn't love ( Lisa Marie and Debbie Rowe) and marriages that lacked love! Prince Michael 2 is MJs biological child. Michael Jackson could not marry the woman he loved because of his father. He bullied him. And , Katherine Jackson bullied him to marry Debbie Rowe after she found out that Debbie Rowe was carrying the child. Katherine did not understand surrogate, she was a Jehovah Witness and her belief is that children should be born in wedlock. *I am going to tell you this and believe it\u2026 Michael Jackson' s secret girlfriend who was not American had children for Michael Jackson too! Children whom she hid from him in her own country. MJ only found out about them in 2009, and he ,Janet and Joseph Jackson flew them back to America in a private jet. How did he feel when he found out? At first he was shock by the amount she had for him, and successfully hid them from him over the years. Secondly, he wanted to choke her to death! Thirdly, he was overjoyed. The happiest man on Earth! The latter part told to me by Janet Jackson in 2009 after Michael passed in 2009 from the world. ",

            "answer_text": "This is an inappropriate question. Asking the paternity of a child who is the progeny of a Black man is a microaggression and considered a racist question. Please research \u201cmicroaggressions.\u201dPeople of color have to put up with this kind of insult and assault that is damaging and discriminatory, Children are born by many methods: In-Vitro implantation, artificial insemination, adoption, surrogacy, with frozen embryos, with a transplanted uterus and so on. Would you consider them less that a full human being? Microaggressions are designed to diminish the legitimacy of a human being. Surely you\u2019re not advocating that! This question is straight out of the tabloid press that incessantly questioned the paternity of Michael Jackson\u2019s children because their skin color does not match his. Questions about skin color and paternity, particularly in mixed race children, are racist. Michael Jackson himself explained how his children were fathered. Why is it that he cannot be believed? Why is this framed as \u201cMichael Jackson claims to have fathered\u2026?\u201d Would a White man be met with such skepticism? Just as the tabloids and others reported \u201cMichael Jackson says he doesn\u2019t lighten his skin; he claims he has Vitiligo.\u201d If a White man made that claim would it be so scrutinized? If someone announces that they have cancer do we frame that as \u201che/she claims to have cancer?\u201d It seems that insensitivity and bullying are especially permissible when characterizing Michael Jackson\u2019s life and legacy. Maybe it\u2019s time to stop for there are racist undertones in such treatment. We can be more aware of our own biases and discrimination and become more sensitive to intersectionality and privilege (White/class/race.) There is a long and terrible history in the United States about Black men and White women that includes lynching if a Black man (even a youngster) dared to even look at a White woman. The sentiment still lingers. Recently police were called on a Black man who was the babysitter for children who were White and he was questioned about why he was escorting White children because he was suspected of a crime (kidnapping.) This is but one indication that there are still racial overtones from slavery and the Jim Crow era. This is 2020. Let\u2019s leave Michael Jackson\u2019s children alone. ",
