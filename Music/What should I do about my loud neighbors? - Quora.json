            "answer_text": "Well, I'd probably start by not using the word obnoxious because that's not very polite. I might also think of a reasonable test. Children are loud at times. They have energy to burn and they need to expend it running around. They get excited about things and their voices get louder. It is entirely unreasonable to expect you will never hear children. It is entirely unreasonable to expect that children will be silent outside. It is somewhat reasonable to expect that children will be a bit calmer and quieter inside (while accepting that they are children, they are still learning to be considerate of others and they sometimes forget to use inside voices). It is entirely reasonable to expect quiet times, for example from 10pm - 7am on weekdays and 11\u20138 on weekends. I might propose a truce with your neighbours. Any and all children noise outside is to be ignored. Wear earplugs, headphones, or do what I taught myself to do 1 noisy summer - stop and remember what it was like to be a child and how exciting and amazing the world was. Parents will work with kids on being quieter and a bit more still inside buildings. This won't be perfect but should eliminate some of the noise. You might also do this - introduce yourself to the parents. Learn the children's names. Smile at them. You don't have to make friends, but be friendly. You\u2019ll possibly find that it makes everyone a bit more inclined to listen and work together. ",

In all other cases, it is the local authority that can take action. In either case, try and document the problem with either notes of when the noise nuisance occurred ot audio or video recordings. ",
