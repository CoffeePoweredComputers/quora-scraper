            "answer_text": "Most of my favorites have been mentioned already. So I think I'll add at least one more obvious one. Robert Johnson. Supposedly when he first showed up he wasn't a great player, according to Son House. But when he came back he blew everyone away. He only made a few records, and I don't think any video was made of him. If he lived to the 1960s and the blues revival of that decade we might know a lot more about his approach to guitar and music. I also want to suggest two players that never were the best, but might have influenced music more if they had lived. One is Buddy Holly, the other is Eddie Cochran. Both were good late 1950s rock musicians who could play guitar. Maybe Ritchie Valens as well. All died after just a couple records. I mostly wonder if they would have continued to make impacts on music or if they would be forgotten if they hadn't died so young. ",

            "answer_text": "Most people will probably pick Jimi Hendrix, and I don\u2019t blame them. I however will pick two. Frank Zappa, who was a very controversial and innovative guitarist. Very prolific catalogue. Who knows what else he could have made if he was still alive? He died at the age of 52 from prostate cancer, and he\u2019s very badly missed here at Wernham Hogg.  He also said that he\u2019d considered running for president. Man I would\u2019ve loved that.  Another would be Stevie Ray Vaughan, who died in his prime. He was a great blues guitarist inspired by Clapton and Hendrix. Was great at playing guitar. He died in a plane crash at the age of 35, and he\u2019s very badly missed here at Wernham Hogg.  ",
