            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not worried about what will happen WHEN Trump loses but if Democrats do succeed in cheating to win I FEAR what DEMOCRATS will do. We don\u2019t see Republican\u2019s out looting and rioting and beating people up. We don\u2019t vandalize yards that are Pro Biden, we don\u2019t charge after people who\u2019s OPINIONS are different than ours. We don\u2019t hunt down cops and Murder them or defund the entire police force then DEMAND they rush to our aid when police aid is needed by THEM. We don\u2019t attack Democrat supporters and verbally and physically inflict injury or harass at PUBLIC places as we encourage all others to join in. Believe it or not Republican\u2019s don\u2019t even defend or support Trump or other Republicans alike WHEN we don\u2019t agree. That\u2019s called respectful advocating. It\u2019s perfectly acceptable to agree to disagree with whom you support. That\u2019s the difference between being active and proactive. I can\u2019t see how it\u2019s beneficial EVER to agree to agree and I will never do that not even with Trump. I value my reputation and embrace my character. I respect no one who refuses to be objective nor do I expect others to, respect anyone who can agree to disagree. I used to support 100% BLM, when the platform and the narrative were genuine and stood with TRUE BLM forums. I don\u2019t support anyone who will see a black life and see victim when regardless of skin colour, fault lies with the colour black. I don\u2019t see he colour black and confirm guilt OR innocence; I allow the facts to determine my view. When an entire group of nothing more than OPINIONATED people begin a hateful crusade against anyone and everyone who doesn\u2019t support them, and nothing is off limits by way of retaliation that\u2019s when society is destroyed. Rational people know there\u2019s a difference between fact and OPINION. When facts prove one way or another opinions are not entitled. Ignoring facts outright to further an opinionated view dies NOT in any way give merit no matter what. I always say NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF STUPID PEOPLE IN LARGE GROUPS! Not to be critical but to allow understanding of people who insist on THEIR WAY IS THE ONLY WAY. That\u2019s not what the USA is about. I try to understand the opposing view no matter what so long as it truly makes sense or the argument is indeed genuine and is supported by information that although opinionated did originate from information that is interpretable. I have liberal friends and I know they make valid points and are not VIOLENT protesters. They stand firmly behind their Democratic support and guess what THEY DO NOT engage in illegal protests they do it the legal way and we get along perfectly. Perhaps it\u2019s because I am not what I\u2019ll describe as REPUBLICAN rather MIDDLE of the road CONSERVATIVE. I don\u2019t have to personally believe in abortion to be able to support a WOMAN\u2019S right to CHOOSE. I support individual circumstances and I\u2019ll not ever apologize for my OPINION of this nor do I feel ashamed that I do not agree with women who choose abortion as a BIRTH CONTROL option, or who have illegal partial birth abortions instead of delivering a healthy baby to be adopted by a loving family. Notice I said ILLEGAL partial birth abortion. I\u2019m referring to women who wait too long and simply want to kill a baby that is by all standards viable and healthy with no foreseen problems for mum or baby. Holding off a few months to deliver a baby is what should be done as killing a baby selfishly for no reason aside from a few months of being pregnant is IMO MURDER. I described in detail so it can be assured I don\u2019t include partial birth abortion performed with medical necessity. I know what it\u2019s like to know being pregnant can cause serious harm to mums. I was one of those mums. Due to Preeclampsia my oldest daughter was in NICU but thankfully they were wonderful and she is perfect. My second I had Preeclampsia and she was perfect but I nearly died. I have a TBI and both pregnancies worsened my neurological symptoms and my second was my last. They said if I were to get pregnant again my body would not fare well and I was lucky to be alive after the last pregnancy, they stated matter of factly that another pregnancy would NOT result in a baby as it would surely KILL me early on. Three years later with an IUD I had a lost IUD and an ultrasound proved an ectopic pregnancy. I had to have surgery immediately and a partial hysterectomy. My doctor agreed without question. I was firm stating I TRIED birth control it failed, I DO NOT BELIEVE in abortion for myself and WOULD not care if my life was in danger and didn\u2019t want to leave my girls without a mum or a new baby without one. I\u2019ve seen children born with severe defects and diseases and their lives are nothing but pain abd suffering and no chance of improving. No human being deserves such a barbaric existence. I\u2019m trying to show that regardless of political views there\u2019s lots of people who don\u2019t see everything as ONE OR NOTHING. That\u2019s such a sad realization in today\u2019s society. People see things without caring there are things that don\u2019t come with RIGHT OR WRONG only solutions. I 100% support LEGAL IMMIGRATION and ironically do do true Democrats. They don\u2019t support those who are illegal and I\u2019m Republican (conservative) and I also am against ILLEGAL immigration. I find it difficult to see how the word ILLEGAL seems to only apply to certain people as a criminal engages in ILLEGAL activity. I listen to Democrats literally stating that Trump is responsible for ILLEGAL immigrants and people in cages which they deem barbaric, yet its 100% fact that OBLAMO is the one who made this policy and somehow this was OK then for 8 years time and he deported LOTS of illegals and no problemo! Yet Trump simply ENFORCES existing laws, building a wall that limits illegal immigration which means LESS people in OBLAMOS \u2018cages\u2019 right? Well NO. Not so much. It seems hypocrisy is also among Democrat leaders as the very ones complaining NO WALL are all living in homes secured by WALLS protecting them from SOCIETY. Why would anyone support illegal anything? I get it I do I don\u2019t like seeing people especially kids in cages. It\u2019s heartbreaking but I support deporting ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not POTUS I couldn\u2019t do it but that\u2019s the responsibility of a POTUS. For Democrats I ask WHAT OTHER OPTION would you suggest? I\u2019m nog talking Mary Poppins either, I\u2019m talking reality options. Legal immigrants get out in case after sentencing and kids are ripped from their arms everyday. Is there a MONEY tree out there or a magic genie to fix it all? What magical solution is there to support illegal immigrants a grand standard of accommodations? Legal citizens work to pay taxes for illegal immigrants who are afforded what tax payers cannot afford and worse yet TOLD my OUR government that THERE IS NO funding to provide them. As if that\u2019s going to be welcomed with open arms. We are a country of immigrants and without restrictions and policies that must be followed and enforced we won\u2019t HAVE a country. There\u2019s only so much that can be accommodated and I find it hard to fathom how those against illegals being deported don\u2019t blame the parents for what those children are going through. They brought them here illegally putting this all in action. Why aren\u2019t these same people complaining offering up free accommodations at their homes or expense? It\u2019s easy to agree with politicians who are fighting to secure views by saying they\u2019ll fight to keep YOUR family in US but only if you vote Democrat, following through is another story. Especially when you don\u2019t research their past. Democrats are the ones who deemed the cages a perfect solution. This is where my info above explains why being ignorant and how large groups of stupid people will never cease to amaze at how reckless their refusal to educate themself results in adding insult to injury. WE CAN DO BAD ALL BY OURSELVES, we should never THRIVE to be worse for wear as we flat out refuse to accept what we WANT to be UNTRUE. Wish in one hand and crap in the other; which one fills up first. I assure anyone reading this I not only expect I appreciate RESPECTFUL feedback even corrective criticism. I\u2019m not a person who isn\u2019t empathetic and I do NOT report or downvote anything aside from outright threats or those who agree I remove myself are relentless towards others associated with my comment. I do not delete any NEGATIVE comments that aren\u2019t included in what I described. No matter how ugly they may get. I DO NOT believe in censorship as I firmly know that without opinions we will NEVER ever be afforded another view. I deal with facts, examples, proof and of course opinions as well as common sense. Not just MY version of said things either. I want to know things I want to learn and without feedback I can\u2019t do that. I tried to detail as much as I could to show I\u2019m able to respect I don\u2019t disagree with Democrat views entirely as I refuse to be overwhelming closed minded. If there\u2019s one thing I stress all the time My opinion is as important to me as others are to them. I cannot fathom arguing something that proves I\u2019m advertising how utterly ignorant and dumb I am. That\u2019s embarrassing really. I will admit however some things I refuse to agree to even disagree with and one example is HRC is a traitor who sent our soldiers to BENGHAZI on a one way trip. She sent them to die along with OBLAMO as they were working with the enemy no TWO WAYS ABOUT IT. They refused military rescue attempts until it was too late, OBLAMO released 5 GITMO terrorists illegally for 1 ARMY deserter whilst simultaneously refusing innocent hostages later beheaded after OBLAMO refused NEGOTIATIONS! He armed Syria with our weapons knowing they\u2019d retreat and ISIS would seize OUR weapons they left behind. That\u2019s my hatred of Democrats and you can see it\u2019s individual specific and allows you knowledge of what I am not going to discuss. I simply refuse to address at all by way of me responding to in any way. I\u2019ll simply ignore it as I scroll past and want to get that out of the way. I know how dreadful the thought of Democrats winning and therefore I know how Democrats feel too. That said I\u2019d never ever even think about acting in the manner Democrats have and are engaging now. ",
