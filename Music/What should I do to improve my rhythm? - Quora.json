            "answer_text": "Do you mean fractions of rhythm? That is all brain work. Study, study, study. Subdivide and mix and match. If you mean that you rush, drag or miss beats, I have two suggestions. First, embrace gravity. Music is rooted in gravity. Conduct for me, can you feel the downbeat and the resting up as you move to the next gravitational beat? Listen to music and move to it. Do you sense that within your body, all your movement is rooted in resisting gravity? Bob your head, tap your foot, wave to someone - gravity! So, now go for a brisk walk or a slow jog. Your left, right, left, right should be pretty stable metronomically. Sing, grunt or breath on each or every other step. If this is indeed solid, you may have one or two other problems. You may be shy, afraid of being heard, afraid of making mistakes or just so shy you are holding back and hesitant. This is painfully obvious in people who are afraid to dance. Be not afraid. You just have to work on this on your own. If your rhythmic problem is in your actual performance on an instrument, you most likely have ergonomic, tension or technique issues. Pretend you are casting a fishing pole but only cast if from your wrist. Go ahead, I won\u2019t watch. Now cast it from only the elbow. It goes further. Now cast from the shoulder. Finally, cast from shoulder, elbow and wrist. See how much more efficient that is when all the muscles work together and are not isolated? Your big muscles are much more accurate and powerful than your smaller fine muscles. All your joints are fulcrums and the larger ones are the most powerful. Pianists for instance, who were trained improperly to play from the fingers (the fingers have no muscle) may be using two muscles to move one bone at the same time which creates tension or uneven playing. Tension gets in the way of our gravity because it is fighting it. If you were reaching for something on your right but I was pulling you from your left, you would struggle to reach the item, your rhythm will be compromised because you are pulling in two directions at the same time. The same thing happens when we rely on our tiny, weak, inefficient or non-existent muscles. This happens a lot in the hands of many pianists. Concentrate on using the larger muscles but, you may need a new teacher to teach you these things. Most people can\u2019t do it on their own. Just as a crane has a large heavy base to support or counter the weight of whatever it is trying to pick up, or the base of a pyramid is large so it can support the weight of its apex or, or like your legs are strong to carry your whole body, your arms control your fingers. The fingers don\u2019t drag the arm. Petting a dog often comes from the larger muscles and rhythmically accurate. Swatting a fly comes from the shoulder and elbow, not the palm. I don\u2019t know why most musicians don\u2019t know this. So, gravity. Use the big muscles to control the little ones. Be not afraid. ",

            "answer_text": "A sense or appreciation for tempos and rhythms is learned, not intuitive. However, there are definitely people with varying degrees of motor skills. The wiring between the ears hearing, brain processing and muscles moving is complex and can have breaks in the circuit. It\u2019s possible to develop neurons in your rhythm circuit. But if your initial wiring wasn\u2019t laid out or soldered well, it can take extra work for your brain to reroute. Okay: How? Like anything else that\u2019s learned, you have to start simple and practice a lot. Earbuds and walking in time with the beat to music is pretty classic. Hand and finger drumming to simple rhythms. Foot tapping. Basically *any* time you listen to music, you\u2019re in the band. Moving something. You\u2019re going to suck at it. Keep doing it. You\u2019ll get better. See if you can \u2018find the one\u2019 in the music you\u2019re playing with. There\u2019s always a beginning to a repeating meter. And it\u2019s very often 1\u20132\u20133\u20134. Funk music heavily accents the \u2018one.\u2019 That\u2019s a good place to start. Once you can find the one, listen to other musics and see where they are accenting. Listen for the \u201cone drop\u201d in Reggae (hint: they drop the one and hit the 3 while the guitar skanks on 2 and 4). Count along with music. Most Western music is in 4 and 8 counts. Dancers count to time their movements. You don\u2019t have to dance, but you can make your fingers and hands dance while you count. To get a sense for complex rhythms, you *have* to get away from Western music. Arabic music. Indian music. Just anything that isn\u2019t EuroAmerican-based. It also helps if you can\u2019t understand the language. A lot of rhythm-challenged people are great at hearing and remembering lyrics and what people say. Their brains focus on that out of habit. So you have to consciously change your focus. Pretending you\u2019re in the band and you *have* to be part of the drum section. Making the music takes your brain out of listener mode (observing) and into performance mode (execution). Different parts of the brain do these things. ",

            "answer_text": "Having a sense of rhythm is absolutely essential for playing ANY musical instrument. Its one of the fundamental building blocks that make up competent and interesting music. Unfortunately, its often neglected in traditional music lessons. Obviously not if you play the drums or percussion or an instrument designed to provide rhythm. It hit me how bad this was when I met an extremely competent classical guitarist. He could play the notes written on the page perfectly, like a metronome. Advanced stuff too. But as soon as we left the sheet music and wanted to improvise or just \u2018vibe\u2019 he simply fell apart. I was shocked. Its like\u2026 How much better could you be if you developed a rock solid sense of rhythm? Really embed those skills inside you so it feels natural, then bring those skills back to the guitar. Usually you find those more interested in creating, writing and composing develop a sense of rhythm because it forms a much needed part of the process. Whereas those more interested in performing tend not to develop their sense of rhythm as much. Its not black and white though, I'm just speaking generally. For me as a piano and guitar teacher, I start everybody off with basic rhythm exercises right from the start as I think its invaluable. I also believe it develops you as a musician. How can you develop a sense of rhythm First of all, this comes more naturally to some than others. To start with, its like maths. After a while you begin to feel it though. So I would start with the most basic exercise to see where you sit and work from there. The exercise I start all my students off with is sit in front of a table and use your left and right rights to alternate between the following rhythmic divisions. Minims (Half Beats)Crotchets (Quarter Beats)Quavers (Eighth Beats)You can set a metronome off. 80bpm is a good starter speed. Or if you are feeling brave, don\u2019t use a metronome at all. You do however need to be sure you can keep a solid time. Use 4 beats in a bar. Set yourself on a nice steady count of 4. Each time you reach 4 this is a complete bar. Return to beat 1 and repeat for bar 2 etc. Now once you are comfortable with that, slip an \u2018and\u2019 in between each main beat. So 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and. Remember to keep it consistent. The \u2018ands\u2019 are important when we get to eighth beats. (it will make sense soon I promise) Start with either hand but for now use the right. Settle into you speed, as I said, 80bpm is good to start with and tap your half beats. Your right should land on beat 1, your left on beat 3. Repeat. I\u2019ll represent this below  By the way, that little + sign is simply the division \u2018between\u2019 the main beats and represents the \u2018and\u2019 we talked about earlier. After a few bars, switch immediately to quarter beats. So\u2026  And then (you guessed it) after a few bars switch to eighth beats. So\u2026  Now this is a very simple exercise which will highlight the base ability level which you can then work from. The idea is to be able to simply switch between these rhythmic divisions naturally without having to think. Once you are comfortable with this, switch you hands over to start on the left. Also, feel free to start switching those divisions up randomly. Add in a touch of spontaneity. In my experience, I am surprised how many musicians haven't attempted this and do in fact struggle with it. I made a video on this exact exercise and you can see it here.  But I don\u2019t want to stop just there. I realise this is a simple exercise and you might be wanting to take things to the next level. In this video I take things further and explore more complicated rhythms. I also demonstrate how you can apply this to your instrument (piano in my case). So, want a challenge? AND some methods you can use to NEVER run out of rhythmic exercises and ideas\u2026 Watch this.  I must stress that whilst these exercises use tapping, its the fundamental concepts and principles which you are training here. Using just a few techniques, you can take these rhythms and apply them to your instrument to create really interesting music. This is what I\u2019m passionate about teaching and I have loads of examples over on my youtube channel. So check it out and get stuck in!

            "answer_text": "This has been a problem of many of my piano/keyboard students, and I was once a professional drummer, so I've paid a lot of attention to the problem. If you've never heard, music has 3 components; melody, harmony, rhythm. That makes rhythm pretty important. You have to FEEL a steady pulse in your body and mind before you begin playing, and never lose it. Traditional teaching says listen to the metronome and stick to the beat. Drumming says ,\u201dYou ARE the beat\u201d. Learn to make a steady pulse happen in yourself, mind and body. Tap your foot to it; clap, sway; dance. Try all different tempos. Once you can feel the pulse (beat), then you need to acquire the skills for reading AND COUNTING (in your head or out loud) the rhythm notation of the music, without losing your feel for that steady pulse. This takes some practice to get used to, just like learning to read the pitches of the notes. In order to learn these skills and develop a really useful and interesting 'rhythmic feel' requires a good teacher, just like any other musical skill. Here's a little group of progressive step by step rhythms to read, understand and feel that I've written to help my students.   Imitation often is a helpful exercises. There are rhythm(drum) apps that play a rhythm for you, then you copy it. ( Remember, never lose your feeling of a steady beat. ) ",

You can do this with your hands on your thighs to a recording (at its simplest) or go to your friendly neighbourhood music store, buy a pair of middle-weight drumsticks and play beats on the bottoms of your running shoes (which make a pretty good substitute for a drum practice pad!), or play djembe or bongos along with records or live musicians (with permission!) Obviously, this will only do you any good if you are actually doing it in time with the music. If you are just floating, it won\u2019t do you any good at all. If you ever get a chance to take a class in West African drumming and dance, do it. It will change the way you think about rhythm forever. ",

This will help your timing a great deal.Always know where the downbeat is. When listening to melodies, try to feel which notes fall on the downbeats. Do this for the bass, drum, keys, and guitar parts too. Pay attention to this when you play also. Getting a good feel for the downbeats will help you to better feel the upbeats and other subdivisions in a measure.Try to count while you play. It's hard to do at first, but keep at it. You'll get it. This will help you to know where you are in a measure.Listen to James Brown songs. Try to clap/strum/tap the drum, guitar, horn and vocal patterns.My 2 cents. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, using a metronome is the way to go. Here is a very effective way to get the rhythm and feel of a piece of music. Say the target tempo is 180 bpm. Practice with the metronome beating quarter notes, 1\u20132\u20133\u20134, at the initial tempo you can play. It really helps if you can tap your foot on the 1 and 3 beat. Increase tempo little by little until you reach the target tempo of 180. Cut the tempo in half to 90 bpm. Now you have metronome clicks on the 1 and 3 counts. Tap your foot on 1 and 3. Practice the piece until you have this down. Now cut the tempo in half again to 45 bpm. Now you just have a click only on the 1 count. Still tap your foot on 1 and 3. Practice the piece until you have this down. Now you have internalized the beat. Practice with no metronome, still tapping on 1 and 3 beat. I\u2019ve found if you can\u2019t tap your foot while playing, you don\u2019t really have the rhythm of the musical piece down. ",

Developing the ability to play the right note is important, but so is playing that note at the right time. Rhythm and melody - the two main parts of music. Practicing with a metronome will help immensely. Practicing with other musicians will confirm your progress. Taking the time to be as accurate, and playing as precisely as possible, will help you reach your goal. Being close is what you can already do. You have already decided it isn\u2019t good enough. Practicing with a metronome isn\u2019t necessarily fun or glamorous, but it is important to developing a sense of rhythm. ",

You can \u201clisten to the metronome\u201d by listening to professionally produced music as well, because they have consistent time for the most part. In my personal experience, I would say rhythm is malleable in the moment and true mastery comes from being able to shift the rhythm at your command. Now add 3 other people to your band and it becomes a difficult challenge, which is why most rock bands play in 4/4. But the best ones can change rhythm together. Really rhythm is all about the in and out. There is a certain circular feel to all rhythms. Learn to recognize this pattern and it helps to dance to it as well :D Air drumming, dead strumming, all help to hone your rhythmic capabilities! Practice, practice, practice! ",

Then apply the improved rhythm to the section sung/played slowly, then at the desired tempo. I would not recommend practicing a lot with the metronome. Instead, as above, teach yourself to keep a completely steady division of beat. Then you can apply it at all times. Check yourself regularly with the metronome Then, when your sense of steady beat division is well developed, you can really begin to be expressive with rhythm, and adding flexibility to that perfect steadiness.

If you're a beginner, there are simple answers like practicing with a metronome and getting a professional teacher. Many of us have gone through that and come out better. If you're a hobbyist, you may just need to get out of your home and play with other people. That can whip you into shape. You may realize that you're rushing or dragging the time, or they'll tell you that. If you've been playing for a long time, trying to get into groups, and still getting dinged for having bad time, you may simply not have a good sense of rhythm, I'm afraid. ",

Tap your foot, but don\u2019t just tap your foot, let the rhythm flow through your whole being and body. I think many people who struggle with rhythm are just to nervous about the process and paranoid that someone might be looking at them and be judging them. Confidence is huge in both music and dance.

Then add smaller movements for those weaker beats. If nothing else, this can be fun! The body's response to music is the beginning of rhythm. ",
