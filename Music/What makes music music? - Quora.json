            "answer_text": "This is a difficult one. Music is the organization of sound in a way that creates a form of expression and communication. If there's is no expression and no communication I think there's no music. If someone writes a score and absolutely nobody feels anything, I would not consider it music. Maybe in some years, after the death of the composer somebody plays the score and enjoys it. That means that the score was music from the first day, but nobody knew that. How is sound organized in order to create music? This is an incomplete attempt to give an explanation: Repetition: Clap your hands twice. You don't have anything. Repeat the pattern and you have rhythm. Limitation of characteristic features: Sound is a universe. In order to create a musical idea, you need to define its limits. The characteristic features of a motive are: Direction, rhythm and contour. If this elements are not limited, it's difficult to generate a basic musical idea. Contrast: The elements of a basic musical idea are limited. If we repeat them the idea is going to be really boring. A basic idea needs a secondary, contrasting idea. Contrast take a lot of forms: a snare drum contrast bass drum. Low pitch contrast high pitches. Forte-piano, staccato-legatto, major-minor, tonic-dominant. Fragmentation: Musical ideas need to divide in fragments. That's the way music is developed. Tension and relaxation: for music to catch our attention, some tension is needed. Tension can be rhythmic, harmonic, melodic, timbric, dynamic. But the only repetition of a pattern with no tension doesn't catch attention, and without attention no communication is possible. That's why I think that Cage was a charlatan. Silence is an element of music, but it's no music by itself. This is my grain of sand. ",

            "answer_text": "There are courses in music theory that I'm sure can put precise scientific words onto my intuitive ears. But in general music has: a definite rhythm, usually defined by some percussion instruments. This can be made by drums, or anything else struck repetitively that \"keeps time\" for the surrounding instruments that make tone. At its most primitive, a complex repetition can be considered music even if there is no change in the notes \u2013 the number of vibrations per second that create a high or low sound, usually measured in hertz to MHz.Musical tone - Wikipedia  Music generally has some kind of repetition, although an entire piece of music need not have one repetitive pattern. Some songs have an introduction in one rhythm, then the main piece in another rhythm; some longer symphonic works have music in a number of different patterns.  Along with a repetitive percussion and preferably some harmonic changes, the hallmark to making a dance pattern into music is the melody. The complexity of the melody is what changes something that would otherwise be an updated version of primitive tribal rhythms into something that repeats in your mind and heart:  The Sleeping Beauty Waltz, by Peter Tchaikovsky, includes all three of these components. The introduction is a different rhythm from the main dance, and more heavily percussive. Once the music breaks into the waltz, the melody overtakes the percussion and becomes the song that we hear whenever we hear the words \"Sleeping Beauty.\" And thus the music sat for 150 years, until Walt Disney decided to add the fourth element of music, lyrics. \"Once Upon a Dream\" became the only version of the Sleeping Beauty Waltz that most people know:  But if you want the same concept in the words of traditional music theory, Wikipedia can help you out: Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "Pull up a chair. It\u2019s going to get deep here. Music is whatever is perceived as music. If you prefer, music is sound in a context that denotes that the sound is worthy of attention, though that attention is not necessarily required. You\u2019ll say, \u201cwhy, that means anything can be music!\u201d And to that I will say, yes, you are absolutely correct. This is why John Cage\u2019s famous 4\u203233\u2033, even though it consists of three periods of inaction by the player or players, is music. It is a piece of music that commands you listen to the sound that is happening when nothing is being played. If it\u2019s approached in this way, the piece can take on amazing, even disturbing, power. Ambient music is music meant to be present, and worthy of attention, but which does not require that the listener sit and concentrate on it. It is meant to be a tinge, a perfume, a something present as part of the environment. Teaching yourself that you are allowed to decide that, for now, the moan and rumble of the approaching subway, or the distant echoes of traffic, or the clacking and hissing of surf over cobbles are all music will remarkably enrich your life. Try it now. Close your eyes and listen to all the sounds that are happening: the louder ones and the softer ones. If this seems hard, record a minute or so of the sound around you with your phone and then play it back on repeat. Listening over and over you\u2019ll start to hear the rhythms and emergent music of things you might not even have noticed. Have fun. ",

            "answer_text": "An aesthetic question, similar to \u2018what makes art art\u2019. Most of us grow up getting exposed to the music of your surroundings, usually folk/pop music. Then some kids will have some kind of musical education like classical piano tuition. These experiences subconsciously define what kind of sound, series of notes and sense of rhythm that could drive your emotion and bring you into another mood. That will be most people\u2019s definition of music. However, if you listen to more variants of music, you may find your personal definitions challenged many times. An extreme, (in)famous example:  Here you won\u2019t find a familiar melodic or rhythmic pattern that could drive your emotion as you expect music would do. You would struggle to accept this as music even though many experts and academicians would argue otherwise. This is where you find that some form of music are less accessible for you; on the other hand, this indicates that indeed human mind is capable of more creativity than you can imagine. So go on, explore more types of challenging and intricate music, music that bedazzle and challenge your perception. It\u2019s like going to vacation places. Anywhere on Earth could be a vacation place, whether it be some jungle swamps or city alleyways. If you keep an open mind, you may find different kind of beauty, different kind of wonderful sensation out of every place. It\u2019s completely fine if you don\u2019t find enjoyment from some types of music. But remember, if it has an audience and staying power, then some people have found an aesthetic experience out of it and you have to respect that. ",

            "answer_text": "If you're asking what makes good music good, then the answer is dependent on the listener. Music in general can be summed up to a collection of sounds that have pitch. Pitch is the actual note delineated by the frequency of the sound. For instance most old office phones ring at A#. This would not generally be considered music but if you were to put it in a setting with other pitched sounds you can make music with it. Composer/pianist Glen Gould made music out of recorded monologues. He found rhythms and pitches there. So, in my opinion, music is anything that can be expressed using musical notation. ",

Paraphrasing he said \u201cMusic is organized time\u201d I like this because it really breaks down the essence of what is musical and it doesn\u2019t have to be tonal. Rhythm - the organization of time into beats by subdividing (western music) or adding (eastern music/ragas) really is the essence of music. It\u2019s why you can feel the beat in a train moving on the tracks or the hum of a car on the road. The only thing that is consistent in all music is that to be music it must begin and end. Even John Cage\u2019s \u201c4:33\u201d which is 4 minutes and 33 seconds of silence (meant to draw attention to the natural noises and experience of the audience as much as the performer) is based on time.

Sometimes he'd get up, try to do his thing. He'd begin to move, something like this: \"Dance...dance\". When he got tired of dancing alone, he'd look in the mirror: \"Gotta find a woman, gotta find a woman, gotta find a woman, gotta find a woman.\" . He'd go down to the lake where all the woman would be swimming or washing clothes or something. He'd look around and just reach in and grab one. \"Come here...come here\". He'd grab her by the hair. You can't do that today, fellas, cause it might come off. You'd have a piece of hair in your hand and she'd be swimming away from you (ha-ha). This one woman just lay there, wet and frightened.
