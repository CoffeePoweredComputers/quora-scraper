            "answer_text": "Quick answer NO. First of all the stars you se are diffrent froom how many strars I see because we all have diffrent range of visible light. The universe is verry large, VERRRY. So each time we get a new toy /telescope, we find more and more stars. There has been estimates but finding out the exact number of stars visible is quite hard if we talk about our galaxy. There are also many reasons as to why it is easier to know the number of stars in milky way than what you see A lot of stars are hidden by clouds and dustMost stars emmit light not visible to us.Also the position of sky varries from place to plase and time to time.",

            "answer_text": "Sure, even your unaided eyes. When astronomers where trying to figure out the characteristics of the Milky Way, before we understood about external galaxies, star counts were the way to quantize the distribution of stars in our galaxy. Photographic plates were taken, marked off in squares, & the number of stars of each brightness were tabulated. Because of the grading of star images was based on the size of the tiny images, it was often called \u201cfly spanking\u201d. Star counting was really boring work. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. We can definitely count stars. And this is a task that astronomers very often do in images. There are softwares that are specifically designed to measure the fluxes of stars even in very crowded fields such globular clusters are, for example. All you need is a digital image and a proper software (such as \u201cdaophot\u201d). ",
