You must take certain amount of steps. If it\u2019s music - it should be published with a time & date stamp - and sealed with any original hand-written documents, etc. Some people - rather than register songs with a publishing company like SOCAN - will have their songs transcribed, demo\u2019ed on a cassette or CD - then mailed to themselves - double-registered - and never open the package when it arrives. However - you make \u201cgetting copyrighted\u201d sound like you\u2019re being penalised in some fashion. And it\u2019s not a penalty. It\u2019s a procedure to go through when you are trying to protect your intellectual property so that no one else can make money from it by claiming that it\u2019s theirs. ",

If you play a song that you don't own the rights to on Instagram live you will get your live paused by Instagram with a message asking if you own the rights to the song with a notice that it's copyrighted material. When that happens, I usually just end my live and restart it without the music or with music that I own the rights to. ",
