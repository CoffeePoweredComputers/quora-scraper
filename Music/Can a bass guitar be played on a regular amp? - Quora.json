            "answer_text": "Yes, and no\u2026 Driving a bass through a guitar amp can be hard on the amp. If you keep the volume low, and stay away from any clipping, you can get away with it. Crank it up full on with a cabinet running at 4 ohms, you might be dancing with the devil. Impedance and ohms are related in that they both refer to resistance however, the resistance varies with frequency when dealing with impedance. As the frequency gets into the low Hz, resistance can drop, and an amp might see a load that is below 1 Ohm. Slap and thump a bunch of these low notes, driving the load to near nothing, the demand for power increases exponentially. This can overheat or even burn out a power transformer, and can also cause transient intermodulation distortion, a type of clipping that can punch a speaker to the limits of excursion. Guitar amps are also often open backed so the speakers are not damped, allowing them free excursion. Using a bass cabinet would protect against these problems. ",
