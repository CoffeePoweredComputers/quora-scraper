            "answer_text": "Liszt was an early supporter of Wagner's music and dramatic ideas, going so far as to transcribe some of Wagner's music for piano and featuring it in his recital tours.  In 1849, Wagner was forced to flee Saxony for Switzerland under threat of arrest. It was left to Liszt to present the world premiere of Wagner's next opera Lohengrin. And eventually, Wagner married Liszt's illegitimate daughter Cosima von Bulow. She was the wife of another virtuoso: pianist and conductor Hans von Bulow who would later give the world premiere of Tristan und Isolde.  The scandal caused by this little romantic triangle (and the fact that Wagner was the father of Cosima's three youngest children) forced Wagner to leave Germany again, going back to Switzerland. Cosima went with him. When the Wagners settled at Bayreuth, Liszt joined them--he was a frequent guest at the Villa Wahnfried and had a house of his own nearby which is now a Liszt museum. ",

            "answer_text": "Richard Wagner was married to Franz Liszt\u2019s daughter, Cosima. When Wagner burst on the scene around 1842, he created a frenzy and many young composers sought to compose just as Wagner did. Liszt was equally famous as Wagner, primarily as a pianist. Much of Liszt\u2019s piano music is almost unplayable. Wagner was not Liszt\u2019s first son-in-law to be married to Cosima. Before Wagner, Cosima was married to Hans von Bulow, a conductor and a concert pianist. Bulow was an avid lover of the music of Wagner, and when Cosima divorced him for Wagner, Bulow remained an ardent supporter of Wagner. Many musicologists believe that some of Liszt\u2019s orchestrations had the touch of Wagner therein. Between those two giants, Wagner and Liszt, stood Cosima Wagner, nee Liszt. ",
