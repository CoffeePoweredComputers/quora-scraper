            "answer_text": "I don't think it has anything to do with any other groups. We are a huge fandom, 26 million on Twitter alone and for all at least 90% of them to watch a new video together seems like bot behavior. I don't know if people use bot views to earn on YouTube but that big a number must seem suspicious. Having said that, BTS ARMY have been breaking records since the end of 2017. YouTube has had 3 years to acknowledge the power of the fandom and if they're still deleting views, it's suspicious on their part and still unclear. ",
