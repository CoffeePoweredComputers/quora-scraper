            "answer_text": "You can play music in a few ways: Bluetooth connection, and/or USB cable to charge and/or connect, or\u2026 -*1.5: a flash drive with your music library on it. some cars have wireless phone charging stations built in (higher trim levels). Usually you can control the music from the unit\u2019s face, steering wheel (if equipped), which is most convenient and safer.another variation would be a Bluetooth USB adapter that would plug into your Receiver\u2019s USB port and pick up your phone\u2019s bluetooth, if you have a head unit without built in bluetooth.Aux(illary) cable. Easy enough with good sound. (I recommend a retractable or shorter cable)Fm transmitter to your fm radio. This can be trouble or static-y if there are local stations with similar or same frequency and they take up a 12v DC (cigarette lighter).Some, not many, can do Wi-Fi/cell tower, or satellite connections, or the cloud.With one of the above, you can do it through basic \u201cmusic\u201d library, Spotify, pandora, YouTube, etc apps through your phone.Oh and if you have a tape deck and headphone (aux 3.55 mm) jacking your phone, you can get crummy music through a cassette tape adapter. I Don\u2019t recommend doing this though unless you have a really old deck. It costs as much, or more than the other options, has noticably lesser quality, and cords will be a PITA and constantly gets snagged on things like the gear shifter, cups, seatbelts, or even you!You must have an aux jack, usb port/jack or FM radio/tape deck on you receiver unit for any of the above to connect with, or built in Bluetooth. Thats about it. The easiest is blue tooth. Or USB. The worst is tape deck adapter. Some units may even have RCA/audio-(video) red/white/(yellow) jacks but that\u2019s usually for amplifiers, and usually an out port, not an in port. These can also (if capable and correct) be used for additional screens for dvds, speakers, and other media, but nothing to do with phones. *Possibilities I didn\u2019t mention and absolutely not worth the mind bending hassle of connectivity and hard to find adaptors or just plain obsolete: s-video, aux-to-rca/rca-to-aux, rf infrared laser, and HDMI (unless you have a blue ray player built in, and a hub/port on your phone ). Oh, That phone size slot is a slot for a cassette tape or maybe even an 8-track\u2026 not a phone btw. Seriously go for bluetooth or usb, or update your deck if you don\u2019t have it altready. Some even have a hard drive or SD card slots for gigs of memory ( or gps). Rock on ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on the radio you have. I\u2019m guessing it doesn\u2019t have BlueTooth streaming, or you likely wouldn\u2019t be asking. If it has an Aux input, you can use that via the phone\u2019s headphone out or a USB to audio & 12v charge cable if one is available for your phone. Some cars don\u2019t have an immediately visible Aux, but creative shops can access one for you. Lastly, you can use an FM modulator, to convert the phone\u2019s output to an FM radio signal, and feed that in through your radio\u2019s FM tuner. This is the least desirable way, as, at best, FM stops at 15kHz (chops off some of the really high frequencies), has poor dynamic range, and poor stereo separation. So you\u2019re at the mercy of how good your modulator is AND how good your radio\u2019s FM tuner is. And you have to find an empty FM frequency, which may change as you drive (for you out there old enough to remember, this is like when we piped our VCR or AtariVision through our {old, 4:3 squarish, tube!} TV\u2019s coaxial antenna input and used channel 3). Wireless FM mods add in their limited transmission strength so often don\u2019t even work as well as wired ones. It would be helpful to know which car you have (including trim level of stock radio, as there may be 2\u20133 offerings for a given vehicle) and what phone you have. Cuts down on a lot of the \u201cifs\u201d for the people answering. ",
