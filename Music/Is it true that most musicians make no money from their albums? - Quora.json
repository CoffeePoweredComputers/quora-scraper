            "answer_text": "Yes it is! In the era of Music Streaming Services such as Spotify, Apple Music, or the Internet. Instead of buying a record, you pay for the streaming which amounts to about $10 a month and offers unlimited listening and titles. Out of this fee, a small percentage is sent to the record label, who then pays the artist proportional to their deal. The big guys have a better shot at making their money than the little ones. ",

            "answer_text": "In the old days, for all but the biggest artists? Yes. Now, for EVEN the biggest artists? Hell Yes. Courtney Love (or so it is claimed) wrote an article for Salon in 2000 that broke down what an artist took in, paid out and had ripped off back in the \u201cold days\u201d. Courtney Love does the math In 2015 The Guardian published the following article breaking down how much Spotify pays artists. How much do musicians really make from Spotify, iTunes and YouTube? A good example: Taylor Swift\u2019s song \u201cShake It Off\u201d was the top streaming song on Spotify in October 2014. It was streamed 46.3 million times. She took home between $280\u2013390 THOUSAND dollars. Artists have always made their largest amount of money from touring. That has not changed nor will it. ",
