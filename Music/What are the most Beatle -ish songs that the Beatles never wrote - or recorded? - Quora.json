            "answer_text": "I am sure there will disagreements with my selections. One reason is that while evaluating a song as Beatleque one naturally hears the song in his or her mind as the band or artist that recorded it. I thought first of each song as never being recorded, then asked myself if I could imagine Lennon, McCartney or Harrison writing something similar to the style. I also considered the amazing evolution of Beatles music just from 1963 to 1966 alone, for example \u201cFrom me to You\u201d to \u201cTomorrow Never Knows.\u201d And finally they wrote many different styles of music over their catalog with too many examples to mention and thus many styles that are Beatlesque So if you have a difference of opinion for a given song please tell me what you think disqualifies it as Beatlesque. MY LIST America - I Need You Badfinger - Baby Blue, No Matter What, Hold On, Flying, Day After Day, We\u2019re for the Dark Beau Brummels - Laugh Laugh Blind Faith - Can\u2019t Find my Way Back Home Bram Tchaikovsky - Girl of my Dreams Buffalo Springfield - Question, Expecting to Fly Byrd\u2019s - She Has a Way, I\u2019ll Feel a Whole Lot Better, Have You Seen her Face, It Won\u2019t be Wrong, Eight Miles High, Turn! Turn! Turn! Eric Clapton - Let it Rain, Layla Cream - White Room Deep Purple -Hush Easybeats - Friday on my Mind Electric Light Orchestra - Can\u2019t get it Out of my Head Guess Who - Hand me Down World Heart - Dog and Butterfly Billy Joel - Don\u2019t ask me Why, Scences from an Italian Restaurant, Anthony\u2019s Song (Movin\u2019 Out), You May be Right Julian Lennon - Valotte (how can one deny it?) Plus the chord changes are as creative as some of his father\u2019s chord changes Knickerbockers. - Lies Monkees - You Just May be the One, You Told Me, The Porpoise Song Moody Blues - Go Now!, Tuesday Afternoon Graham Nash - There\u2019s Only One Oasis -virtually every song (at least that seems to be what they strived for) Michael Penn - No Myth Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers - American Girl, Refugee, Here Comes my Girl, The Waiting Raspberries - Tonight, Let\u2019s Pretend, Go All the Way The Records - Starry Eyes Remains - Don\u2019t Tell me the Truth Paul Revere And the Raiders - Kicks Rolling Stones - You Better Move On, The Last Time Todd Rundgren - I Saw the Light Status Quo - Pictures of Matchstick Men Stealers Wheel - Star Steppenwolf - Monster, Hey Lawdy Mama Supertramp - Breakfast in America, Give a Little Bit Turtles - Outside Chance U2 - Desire Veruca Salt - Empty Bottle Who - Getting in Tune Steve Winwood - While You See a Chance Yardbirds - Shapes of Things Zombies - I\u2019ll Call You Mine I am interested in your thoughts whether or not you agree on individual songs.

            "answer_text": "Street the Beat, \u201cFalling In Love\u201d This is just amazing stuff. The band was formed by Puerto Rican ex-gang members from the Bronx. They played mainly on public access TV or in subway stations with cheap acoustic guitars and percussion provided by thumping on a cardboard box, yet it still magically sounds like something the Beatles would have sung on the Ed Sullivan Show.  Lazy Smoke, \u201cThere Was A Time\u201d The album Lazy Smoke, Corridor of Faces is one of the rarest psychedelic albums pressed in the 1960s, but original copies never show up, because it\u2019s so good that nobody wants to sell it. Basically, imagine what Sgt. Pepper would have sounded like if John Lennon hadn\u2019t ceded control to Paul and you didn\u2019t put in all that music hall stuff, but it\u2019s recorded by 4 guys you never heard of on a budget of 4 dollars and 98 cents. If you like the lo-fi aspects of the White Album with the pop-psych of Pepper and Lennonesque vocals, then Lazy Smoke just may be your bag, baby.  The Merry-Go-Round, \u201cListen, Listen\u201d It\u2019s the closest homage to \u201cSgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band\u201d without being outright plagiarism. Frontman Emitt Rhodes later went solo to record some very McCartneyesque albums in the early 1970s.  The Chartbusters, \u201cShe\u2019s The One\u201d \u201cLies\u201d by the Knickerbockers is probably the best Beatles rip-off to hit the Top 40 when the Beatles were still together, but The Chartbusters, \u201cShe\u2019s The One\u201d comes a close second.  The Beagles was an animated TV show by the same people who did Underdog, but the gimmick was that they were two dogs that wanted to be rock stars. The show gave the Beagles very Beatlesque songs to work with. One of my favorites is \u201cSharing Wishes,\u201d which is about falling in love with somebody while doing the dishes.  The Spongetones, \u201cShe Goes Out With Everybody\u201d The indie rock of the 1980s provided a lot of room for different musical styles, but some indie bands just wanted to crank out Beatlesque songs over and over again. And who can blame them?  The Fut, \u201cHave You Heard The Word\u201d This pastiche of late period Beatles is supposedly a recording with members of the Bee Gees under a pseudonym. It sounds so much like John Lennon that Yoko Ono once tried to file copyright on it!  Peter Cook & Dudley Moore, \u201cL.S. Bumble Bee\u201d The British comedians Peter Cook and Dudley Moore wrote a novelty bit that satirized the nascent psychedelic sounds of the time, but they sounded close enough to the Beatles that the song used to be passed off on Beatles bootlegs as an unreleased Beatles track.
