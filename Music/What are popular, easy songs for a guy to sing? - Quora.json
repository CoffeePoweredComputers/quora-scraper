            "answer_text": "Most pop songs are unfortunately very difficult to sing, since most people tend to prefer singers with impressive vocal abilities (high notes, unique timbres, etc.) such as Bruno Mars and Adam Levine. When I first started singing, I had a lot of trouble hitting notes that were higher than around a D4 or E4 in my chest voice. That said, here are a few songs that are pretty easy (range-wise) to sing: Chasing Cars by Snow Patrol; highest note in the entire song is a D4, which most men can train to sing comfortably. Instrumental (guitar) part is also fairly easy to play.The Scientist by Coldplay; the highest note in chest voice is a D4, although the chorus requires an F4 in head voice as well as transitioning between head and chest voices. Piano part is also reasonably easy to play.Collide by Howie Day. Highest note is a D#4 in chest voice and a G#4 in head voice. Also requires some transitioning between head and chest voice.Wherever You Will Go by the Calling. Highest note is an F#4 (chest voice).These songs, however, are from roughly a decade ago. I can't think of any easy-to-sing songs from the past few years, but any song can be made easier by taking the key down: When I Was Your Man by Bruno Mars is originally in C major; taking this down to G major or F major makes it much easier to sing.Radioactive by Imagine Dragons is originally in B minor; taking it down to E or F minor makes it more vocally manageable.Hope this helps!
