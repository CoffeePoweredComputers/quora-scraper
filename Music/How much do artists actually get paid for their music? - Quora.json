            "answer_text": "Well, this is difficult to answer, but I can tell you how they get paid. Artists generally get money from different sources. Most of it comes from concert tickets. Very little, if any at all comes from streams or record sales. If an artist is signed to a record label: Generally this is how it works. An artist signs a deal with a label and the label gives the artist an advance on their royalties so they can pay for the production of their first album. Let\u2019s say this number is $100,000. Once the album is done, the record label releases it and the the royalties start to come in. The artist doesn\u2019t get paid until their advance is recouped, which means, until the label gets their $100,000 back, the artist doesn\u2019t see any money from the record. Even after that, the the artist and label split additional royalties. As you can imagine, it takes quite a lot of streams and music sales for the artist to start making money. ",
