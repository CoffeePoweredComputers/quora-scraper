            "answer_text": "Yes, it is generally regarded as one now, though there was some historical use of the term to mean \u201ca clever, cunning person,\u201d based on the supposed cunning of the animal. However, the disparaging use for a black person, which seems to have been derived from a Portuguese word meaning, roughly, \u201cthe inhabitant of a cage or pen,\u201d was current by the early 19th century. The two originally unrelated terms fused to some extent in the late 19th century; blacks adopted it to apply to each other, but the word was always considered comic at best (like \u201charp\u201d or \u201cMick\u201d for an Irishman, \u201cFritz\u201d or \u201ckraut\u201d for a German, etc.) and at worst deeply offensive. Nowadays it is pretty much completely unacceptable in polite society. ",

            "answer_text": "In the State of Louisiana, all Louisianans are called \u201ccoon ass\u201d, no matter if they are Black or White. The term has nothing to do with raccoons. It is derived from a French word meaning uncouth or crude. When Louisiana Cajuns spoke their crude form of French to native French speakers, they were called coonasse. ",
