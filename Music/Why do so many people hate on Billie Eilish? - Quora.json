            "answer_text": "Hahaha\u2026 I was reading these answers to the question \u201cWhich are the darkest songs?\u201d. Someone listed some of Billie Eilish songs. And immediately another answer said fuck off to her songs, and listed his own choices. I honestly don\u2019t know why someone would have that kind of reaction just because someone mentioned her name. Most of the people of my demographics don\u2019t listen to her music. But they don\u2019t hate her either. My friends hate someone like Nicki Minaj, Lil Pump, and all those folks. But they seem to be fine with Billie Eilish\u2019s music. They seemed more fascinated, and impressed than anything else. My grandma watched one of her video, and changed the channel cause she found it a bit creepy, and scary. She said she liked the uniqueness of the music, but just couldn\u2019t stand the video. When I told her about how young she was. She was actually amazed. So, i don\u2019t think most people hate Billie Eilish. But those who do hate her might do so because how she tends to draw young edgy teen towards her music. Or how she herself is a weird edgy teen\u2026 Besides, anything that is popular always tends to draw negativity from certain section. ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly I really don\u2019t know why. She\u2019s an amazing 18 year old who is so unique and is one of the nicest people ever! Especially to her fans, and she hasn\u2019t done anything wrong or been in trouble, ever. They probably are just jealous of the talent she\u2019s got and how she wears \u201cbaggy clothes.\u201d Her talent is amazing, and honestly, she is one of the only people who can use auto-tune correctly! Hell yeah, she\u2019s been depressed, and she truly shows it, but that\u2019s not something to hate on her for. And I wish people would stop saying that she whispers into her mic! She doesn\u2019t!! And have those haters listened to those songs where she is singing her heart out? I guess not, they don\u2019t know that. And she is NOT SMUG. Everyone\u2019s gotta understand that. Those haters just shout out things that their being like they could ever be better. She is amazing to her fans and makes beautiful music! It\u2019s just that those people are jealous and they don\u2019t know what she is, truly inside! ",
