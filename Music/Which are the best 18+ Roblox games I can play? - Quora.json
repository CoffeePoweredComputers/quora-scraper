            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think that there are any much 18+ games on Roblox. Well, there were \u201cScented Cons\u201d there which were basically games on Roblox which people did inappropriate things on, however those got taken down on Roblox because it violated their terms of service. Roblox is a game that designed to be for ages 8\u201318 so there shouldn\u2019t be any \u201c18+\u201d games on Roblox at all! I hope this helps! ",
