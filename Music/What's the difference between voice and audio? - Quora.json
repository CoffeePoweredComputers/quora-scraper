            "answer_text": "A voice is a quantity produced by an animal like a human being when it speaks using its vochal cords. When this voice is digitally sampled, or in other words, converted into an electric signal and then rendered into a playable format, it is called audio. E.g.: When I record a speech given out by my mother on her anniversary, the input to the recorder is \"voice\" while the output when I play the speech on a player is \"audio.\" ",

            "answer_text": "Voice is a specific kind of sound which is produced either by an animal's larynx (well, larynx is what Humans use anyway) or machine emulating the voice of an animal.  Audio is all sound, but most often used when speaking of reproduced sound  (like a recording), or synthetic sound (like a synthesizer), or both (like Prince).  Hmmm, actually I guess I would say audio is anything which comes out of speakers or headphones. ",
