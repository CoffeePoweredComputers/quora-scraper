            "answer_text": "Taehyung has a very symmetrical face and his side profile is aesthetically pleasing. To be quite honest he is pretty symmetrical from head to toe. He\u2019s been pretty symmetrical his whole life actually, if you look at his younger pictures then you\u2019ll find that he was an attractive young boy. Ok that sounded a bit bad, uhhhh lets move on.  Tae Tae also hasn\u2019t had any cosmetic surgeries at all. So his looks are a result of genetics. Well except for many of the hair colours we\u2019ve seen him have. May I say a quick thank you to Kim Taehyung\u2019s genetics from being so, I don\u2019t know, FLAWLESS!! It may also be his playfulness. Many people find energetic fun people to be more attractive. https://media1.tenor.com/images/17d7034108add9bbca304e58a1404707/tenor.gif?itemid=6004898 just for short and for fun, I normally say that puberty kicked him in the ass hard and for some reason it made him hot. there are also people who find deep voices attractive which Tae for sure has. to be honest I\u2019ve always been a V stand so I have gonna come up with some reason off the top of my head just for the sake of it. But there are actually real reasons and not just silly ones like, \u2018if you compare him to me I look like a derpy potato\u2019 or something like that. I was actually surprised to find so many scientific reasons for Tae\u2019s visuals, it also gave me an excuse to study his face, so um, \u2022___\u2022 ",

            "answer_text": "Kim Taehyung has, and even from a young age, always looked so handsome and cute.        Judging from even his predebut pictures, Taehyung has always looked pretty handsome, so I\u2019m pretty sure he has not undergone any surgery and just remains natural. And, undeniably, I think he gets these beautiful features from his parents. Recently, a photo of V\u2019s father was posted on the BTS twitter, and GOSH WHAT THE HELL THEY LOOK SO FREAKING SIMILAR AND HANDSOME-   Anywho, look at this cutie patootie with his mother-  She\u2019s so beautiful and still looks youthful.        God really gave him the finest looks on this earth :,)  ",
