            "answer_text": "Depends on the band and contract, but here are several scenarios I\u2019ve seen. First, if you\u2019re part of an advertised band, the band splits the revenue somehow. If you\u2019re a musician for an artist (think the players for singers), it\u2019s more like below. Low level bar band: band splits whatever they get paid evenly between them (tickets, cover, flat rate, etc) Regional Band trying to make it: band members makes nothing; all the money goes back into the band/business for marketing, recording, merchandise, etc. In fact, they probably spend their own money Low level touring band: each band member gets a daily amount for food (anywhere from $15\u201350/day), plus a set amount per show (anywhere from $50 - $150) High level touring: same as before but rates are better Retainer/contract: rare, but you get a weekly or monthly pay check to be ready to play whenever/wherever.
