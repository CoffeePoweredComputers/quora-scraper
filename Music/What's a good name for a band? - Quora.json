            "answer_text": "If you ask this to ten different people, you are likely to get 10 different answers, many of them contradictory. I have rules I like to follow, but I can be convinced to waive rules if needed. You also may want to factor in what kind of band you are. If you intend to play shows, put out albums, promote, tour, etc, then you need to think about that in context of a name. If you don\u2019t care about that stuff, you have more freedom, IMHO. My rules: Unique - There isn\u2019t another active band using this name, and there isn\u2019t a band that has been active in several decades. Do you really want to live in another bands shadow, or be the band Z from the US, not the one from the UK, or South Africa, or Australia, etc.? This gets more and more difficult as time goes on, particular with the next requirement.Preference for one word, then two, then three. If you have to use four words, you should keep looking.Everyone that is a core member of the band should agree. This can be a huge deal to some musicians, enough that they will quit a band because they don\u2019t like the name. If you want people to hang around, get everyone\u2019s buy in on the name. If you already have a name and are filling a position, make it clear the name is non negotiable up front. This is often the most difficult in my experience.Should be somewhat logical considering the genre you are playing. There is something to be said for being a contrarian, but The Pink Unicorns might not make a lot of sense for your death metal band. Then again, it might be the best name ever by bucking the typical trend and making you stand out.Online - These days it is smart to consider whether the name you have chosen is taken. Can people easily tag you? Search for you on the internet? There is something to be said for being secret, and people have trouble finding you, you know, you are so underground you have to be in the know. Generally this is fine if you don\u2019t care about your band getting popular.The loud bar test. If you are in a loud bar, and it is hard to hear, will the person understand your name? I once was in a band called Cloud of Suns. People would think I was saying Cloud of Sons. I don\u2019t know why someone would jump to that, and we never considered this would happen when naming the band. Live and learn.Controversial names, names like Anal Cunt are intended to be offensive and induce shock. It is a middle finger at society approach, and there are people that such a name will appeal to. However, if you choose a name that is offensive or could be offensive to people, know what you are getting into. If people boycott you or don\u2019t want to book your band because of your name, you have no one but yourself to blame if you choose a name that could be offensive.There is some truth that if your band is absolutely amazing, and is blowing everyone away to where people are talking you up to their friends, it really does not matter what your name is, people will dig it. This situation is quite rare. Whatever you do, don\u2019t change your name later. That is the worst thing you can do, because you basically have to start over with name recognition. Just find a name you like up front. Changing your name is a big setback for an active band. Usually, by the time I get everyone to agree on a name, I am so worn out and ready to move on to making merch and booking shows, that I let some of the above rules slide. Maybe they are more guildines than rules. A few names of my recent bands are below. I think these are all good names, but not everyone would agree. Boneworm - Stoner/Sludge Doom Metal Skull Island - Instrumental Stoner Doom Electric Ring - Solo Experimental drone, noise, and soundscapes Hound The Wolves - Psychedelic drone metal A//TAR - Post-metal That is pronounced Altar, but with two ls, and slashes for the Ls. This one breaks a couple of my rules above, but we are arty. :) The last three projects are active right now. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm not one for being able to name anything that well, but here are a few things I've gathered from other people's experience: Be unique (hah). Of course. Bands like Coldplay, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Fugazi and Radiohead have crafted their name to fit their sound. Even if the word or phrase had prior meaning, it is now associated almost completely with them. Think about words that describe your music and try to pull from that a memorable phrase or name. Look up synonyms, poetic references, etc. and see if you can 'visualize' an energy. Limit the humor and non-sequiturs. A funny band name is fine, and may find yourself connected with a niche audience, but not everyone shares the humor, even if they may like your music. Anal Cunt is all well and good, I suppose, but how many people are you alienating just by choosing that name? Crispy Ambulance is, well, nothing really. Sorry, Crispy Ambulance. Savage Garden seems to have worked well for that band, but I still don't know how it relates to them at all. A band name should be evocative, connected with the personality and creativeness of the band itself. Names like 'the checkbook stubs' or 'pocket lint' really don't do anything to tell me anything about what you do, or where you're going. Color of Clouds evokes something (to me at least), and their music follows suit.  Coming up with a great band name seems to be almost as enigmatic as coming up with a #1 hook, but I think as long as it actually serves your band a purpose, rather than just making a quick statement, it'll do you well.   If you can end this sentence well, you may have a good band name on your hand: Ladies and gentlemen, PLEASE WELCOME TO THE STAGE....  Insert loud applause, screaming, and shirts being torn off.   -edit- An interesting, and possibly fruitful, thing to do would be to look at the bands you enjoy, understand their name and why it was chosen, figure out how it relates to their music, and grab pointers from there.
