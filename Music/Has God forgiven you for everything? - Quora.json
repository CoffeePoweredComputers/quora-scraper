But in the end, god doesn\u2019t care about what good deeds or sins you have committed (Isaiah 64:6). The only sin god won\u2019t forgive you for is the sin of not believing in him (Matthew 12:31). And since I don\u2019t believe in him, it\u2019s his fault for not convincing me of his existence. Sorry, but I need facts. And god lacks any and all facts. ",

This is the second death. 15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. ",

            "answer_text": "God is ever forgiving and always loving. It is up to the person concerned to keep up the commitments they willingly make to God/themselves. A person who chooses the path of sinfulness, is bold enough to face the consequences arising out of such actions and preferred to keep God away. When a person includes God in all their actions, they normally refrain from committing sinful acts. Just because God forgives, it does not mean one does not suffer from sinfulness. By repentance, by sticking to righteousness, one can bravely withstand the testing times and come out joyfully. The beauty of this mortal life is one can willingly and consciously choose how they want to make the best of this life. ",
