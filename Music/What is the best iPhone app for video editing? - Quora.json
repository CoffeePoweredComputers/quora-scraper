            "answer_text": "iPhones are steadily becoming more powerful, and capable of highly intensive tasks. With that, the camera in these smartphones has also improved to the extent that we can even shoot 4K videos. All these capabilities make iPhones highly capable of handling both shooting videos and editing them. 1. LumaFusion When it comes to video editing on the iPhone, no other app comes even close to the feature set that is packed inside LumaFusion. It is the only outright paid app on this list and it deserves every cent.  2. iMovie iMovie is a part of Apple\u2019s own suite of products for iOS (and macOS) and is a great video editor app for iPhone that you can try. While you may want to use more powerful editing software on your Mac, iMovie is more than capable of handling video editing on the iPhone. The app is included with the newer generations of iPhones, and you can use it right out of the box to make some awesome videos directly on your iPhone. 3. Videoshop Videoshop is a powerful video editor for iPhone, that will let you perform a plethora of operations on your videos. You can record clips directly from within the app, or import them from your camera roll. Once you have done that, you can add text to the clip, add narration, merge multiple clips into one, and a lot more. You can also add tilt-shift to the video, and add transitions between multiple clips. The tool is definitely very powerful, and you can perform a lot of manipulations on your videos using Videoshop.  4. Splice Splice is a video editor from GoPro, the company behind some of the world\u2019s best action cameras. You can import your photos and videos into the app, to edit them into a movie. The way the app works is simple: you just import the videos that you want to edit and mark the important parts (Highlights, as the app, calls them) of the video. You can then add music to the video, and then the app automatically clips the entire video according to the Highlights that you marked. 5. InShot Video Editor that is an easy to use video editor for your iPhone which brings tons of features. The app allows you to edit both photos and videos and also create video collages. When it comes to editing, you will find all the basic editing tools here such as cut, trim, delete, merge, adjust the video, and more. You can also add your own music or select from its own free music options. The app is also good for Instagram users as it allows you to edit square videos perfect for Instagram. 6. Cameo Cameo is another really good video editor app for iPhone, developed by the folks over at Vimeo. The app offers very basic video editing capabilities but works really well. The interface is clean and intuitive, and if you just want to perform a couple of basic edits on your video, Cameo is the perfect option. The app can import photos and videos from the camera roll, and you can easily trim them, add music, themes, and more. You can even adjust the intensity of the theme applied to the video, to get the perfect effect. ",

            "answer_text": "Apple\u2019s iMovie (free) is probably the most accessible editing app. It's basic and designed to be friendly, though it can edit 4K video that iPhones and iPad Pros can shoot. On the other side of the spectrum is Luma Fusion. I don't own it, but it looks an awful lot like a mobile version of Apple's Final Cut Pro X, their video editing software for professional video editors. Final Cut Pro X is available for Mac only. Luna Fusion has received praise from serious video editors, though I'm sure it doesn't have all the features of Adobe's or Apple's pro desktop video software. If you have limited or no experience with video editing, I definitely recommend starting with iMovie. The nice thing is that if you outgrow iMovie, Luma Fusion is available. ",
