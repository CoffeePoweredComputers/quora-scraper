            "answer_text": "Butterfly Kisses by Bob Carlisle I guess there is a little bit of a reason. I grew up without a father. My mother dated someone from when I was in preschool until 4th grade, who truly loved me. He was a d!ck to my mom and sister, but he really loved me and treated me like his own. After they broke up, we moved in to a tiny apartment and I wasn\u2019t allowed to see him anymore. I remember driving in the car with my mom around that time and that song came on the radio (circa 1998) and I just broke down in to tears. I had heard that song before but never had any kind of emotional reaction or association with it. I think it was because I felt like I had a dad for a period of time and lost it. To this day, I cringe at that song\u2026. like immediately change the station if it comes on, give glaring eyes to anyone who even mentions it\u2026 kind of hate. So, in short, I guess I kind of have a reason but not directly. ",
