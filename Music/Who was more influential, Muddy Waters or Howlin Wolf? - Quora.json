            "answer_text": "I give Muddy Waters a very slight edge because: 1. The Rolling Stones named themselves after one of his songs; 2. Jimi Hendrix said the first guitar player he was aware of was Muddy Waters; and, 3. Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cWhole Lotta Love\u201d is based on Muddy Water\u2019s hit \u201cYou Need Love\u201d (written by Willie Dixon). Otherwise, they\u2019re both among the most influential blues musicians of all time. The two are equally influential and had very similar careers. Muddy Waters - birth name McKinley Morganfield (1913\u20131983) Howlin\u2019 Wolf - birth name Chester Arthur Burnett (1910\u20131976) Both were born and grew up in Mississippi and then moved to Chicago as adults, Muddy Waters in 1943 and Howlin\u2019 Wolf in 1952. Both defined the Chicago Blues. Both sang, played guitar and harmonica. Both recorded on Chess Records. They were rivals in Chicago. Both are in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Muddy Waters songs: Hoochie Coochie Man, I\u2019m Ready, I Just Want To Make Love To You, Got My Mojo Workin.\u2019 Howlin\u2019 Wolf songs: Smokestack Lightnin\u2019, Killing Floor, Spoonful, Back Door Man. Muddy Waters played with: Little Walter Jacob, Jimmy Rogers and Otis Spann. Howlin\u2019 Wolf played with: Hubert Sumlin, Jimmy Rogers and Buddy Guy. It\u2019s really incredible that they were rivals in Chicago for more than 20 years. ",

            "answer_text": "I would have to say Muddy Waters, if only for the fact that I heard and heard about him from a young age. And it seemed like a lot of credits on the music I bought when I was young were to Muddy. I got to see him at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa back in 1974, and he gave a great show. This is in no way demeaning the work of the Wolf. But I still haven\u2019t seen many covers of his work. And I have of Muddy. ",
