            "answer_text": "The madness of the past decade and a half seems to be behind them, but now they are left in a position where the top of the Championship is super-competitive. People say the Premier League is the most exciting league in the world, but I\u2019d honestly say the Championship is more exciting, you really never know what will happen. Wolves so far look like the Manchester City of the Championship (and indeed gave them a right good game in the League Cup), but below that it\u2019s a giant free-for-all. Leeds so far are bang in the mix, but it will need a great effort to force their way into the top 2/6. I think what they are doing is smart though, they don\u2019t have the money of Wolves, but they have shrewd owners who seem to know the game, and have picked up some unearthed diamonds who are performing well this season.

            "answer_text": "Bad Chairmen and owners basically. Bates \u2018rescued\u2019 the club by paying a few pounds. It became obvious that his purchase was only in order to add money to his bank account. He sold any player who would attract a transfer fee and brought in poor free replacements. When he decided to sell it was to a banking group who seemed to have the same idea. Eventually the club was bought by Cellino who injected money but who had a string of bans and personal court cases to sort out. Only recently, under the management of Gary Monk has the team appeared steady and capable of mounting a title challenge. ",
