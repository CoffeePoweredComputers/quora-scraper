            "answer_text": "Music has always been inherently part of black culture. While other cultures keep it separated Or marginalized, it is more integrated in ours. When slaves were taken from Africa, they brought their rhythms and sounds with them and the music was a source of strength to help deal with the harsh life of slavery through Negro spirituals and became a fixture of the black church. Other forms developed to be the voices of the black experience including Jazz, Blues, Early rock, and R&B. For many, they opened doors to employment where barriers existed in other careers. ",

In the early 18 & 1900\u2019s individuals who never had access to education as compared to others, mostly poor, hard workers, treated like crap, produced what was called by 1970\u2019s musicians as the greatest sound in music they have heard. I am talking about greats like Charlie Patton, howling wolf, Leadbelly etc\u2019\u2019learned by some ability of the mind to learn, compose, sing, entertain that I believe Beethoven would bow down to these masters.
