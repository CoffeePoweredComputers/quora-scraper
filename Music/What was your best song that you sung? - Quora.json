            "answer_text": "It was my college fest. I was in third year and was literally forced by my friends to perform. Actually blackmailed. At the very last moment, the main vocalist from class group fell ill and no one was ready to fill in for her. So, I had to. There were four songs in total - two Tamil songs, solo; one Hindi song, duet; and one Hindi song, group song. I had to perform duet. The original song chosen was too slow and I asked it to be changed as I knew audience would boo at slow songs. I switched the song to Zoobi Doobi from 3 idiots. I performed the song with one of my classmate and as our song started, the people started responding quite well and everybody was highly applauding. We got motivated and performed very very well. Our performance turned out to be 3rd among 30 performances. After that day, everyone used to sing Zoobi Doobi while seeing me and I was known in whole college as Zoobi Doobi girl. Even my HOD told me - I performed really well. She was so proud of me. We definitely NAILED IT. I performed FAB. WINK ",

            "answer_text": "John Lennon always said, according to Yoko Ono, that he never felt his vocal tracks were good enough for the take. Proof that he was better than I will ever be....: Listen to my version of \"Mind Games\" :   Many artists, including myself, are perfectionists which is why my concept on YouTube was to record just one take per song. (that is probably my wortst, so you shall have to hear the others and read others' comments.)  I'm 'nomusician' (or no singer). Select my playlist called My Pop Recordings and listen to any of the 96 other videos.  Keep up the singing (in the shower) is what I always say.Just yesterday I played and sang at yet another birthday party, \"We Have All the Time In the World\", and played it again as an encore. ",
