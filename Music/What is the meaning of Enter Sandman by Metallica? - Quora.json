            "answer_text": "Per James Hetfield (Lead Vocals, Rhythm Guitarist, Main Writer for Metallica): \u201cI wanted more of the mental thing where this kid gets manipulated by what adults say. And you know when you wake up with that shit in your eye? That's supposedly been put in there by the sandman to make you dream. So the guy in the song tells this little kid that and he kinda freaks. He can't sleep after that and it works the opposite way. Instead of a soothing thing, the table's turned.\" James\u2019s original lyrics were about Sudden Infant Death Syndrome; when a baby dies inexplicably in its crib. The current line of; \u201cOff to never never land\" was originally; \u201cDisrupt the perfect family,\" meaning that the \"sandman\" actually killed the baby. At that point in time, Metallica had a strict policy of not commenting on each other's individual contributions, but their new producer, Bob Rock, was still considered an \u201coutsider\u201d with the band and spoke up about needing the lyrics to be a bit more commercially accessible and meaningful. The rest is history. ",

Extras \u2013 \"James On Writing \"Enter Sandman\" Lyrics. the lyrics featured in the song are not the original; Hetfield felt that \"Enter Sandman\" sounded \"catchy and kind of commercial\" and so to counterbalance the sound, he wrote lyrics about \"destroy the perfect family; a huge horrible secret in a family\" that included references to crib death. For the first time in Metallica's history, however, Ulrich and producer Bob Rock told Hetfield that they felt he could write better lyrics. Nevertheless, according to Ulrich, the song was the \"foundation, the guide to the whole record\" even before it had lyrics. ",
