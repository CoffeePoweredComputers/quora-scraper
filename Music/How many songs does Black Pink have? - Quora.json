            "answer_text": "Blackpink is notorious for underfeeding their fans. They only have 13 songs and they\u2019ve been around for 3 years. All blinks ever do is ask for a comeback, and they never get anything in return. It\u2019s really frustrating to me. Blackpink could\u2019ve been huge, if only YG knew how to manage. Literally all Kpop managers are trash, and overwork their idols, but YG is one of the worst Theres probably an article on Dispatch about the dating scandal between YG and gambling. He\u2019s also such an unbearable manager that Jennie posted a video of herself twerking when the news that he was going to jail came out. Jennie (and probably all the other Blackpink members) hate YG. He\u2019s terrible at protecting members and combatting rumors during scandals. A while ago dispatch revealed that Jennie and Kai were dating.  These were the photos they released, of Jennie getting in a car with Kai. We all know how crazy fangirls, fanboys, and antis can be, so obviously Jennie (and Kai too, but to a lesser extent because of course male idols are never treated as terribly as female idols) started getting hate. And you know what Blackpink\u2019s company had to say??  That\u2019s right, they said he was her uber driver.  So yeah, YG is one of the worst (if not the worst) managers in Kpop. I\u2019m not even a blink, and I know about how terrible he is. I know you asked a really simple question but it set me off on an anti-YG tangent. Terrible management has made it so Blackpink has less songs than most rookie groups. The most recent \u201ccomeback\u201d I\u2019ve seen is BP\u2019s tiktok ad for Samsung.  If you want to know any girl groups that actually have comebacks, I would recommend Loona, Mamamoo, or Twice. Thanks for reading :) -fellow Kpop junkie ",
