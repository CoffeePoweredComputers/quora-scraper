            "answer_text": "Yes he has. 1989's Oh Mercy passed under the radar a bit when it was released but it's been re-evaluated lately as something of a classic. It's a fantastic set of songs with an amazing sound thanks to Daniel Lanois's production. It's even better if you mix it with some outtakes that Dylan mysteriously left on the shelf for a while, especially the haunting \"Series of Dreams\" 1997's Time Out of Mind is often cited as his comeback album. To Make you Feel My Love has been covered by lots of people and might well go down as one of his greatest ever love songs. 2001's Love and Theft continued in the same vein as Time Out of Mind and proved he could still write great songs. From this album onwards he started producing his own albums (under the pseudonym Jack Frost) and proved he didn't need help to get the most out of his band in the studio 2006's Modern Times was a third critical and commercial success in a row which definitely proved that Bob wasn't just a nostalgia act fluking a late-career hit or two, he was one of the twenty-first century's greatest songwriters just as he'd been the 20th century's greatest.  2012's Tempest was another return to form after the slight dip in quality that was 2009's Together through Life. Tempest is a dark album with a 14 minute ode to the Titanic which does a lot to convey a sense of genuine tragedy. It also features his tribute to John Lennon (with no explanaton as to why it took him 32 years to write) If you were going to put together a list of Bob Dylan's greatest albums, these five would all demand serious consideration. They might not have had the cultural impact of his earlier albums and they're by no means as influential but if you take his work out of it's historical context and just view each album as a set of songs they all hold up to almost anything else he's done.
