            "answer_text": "Sua, Moonbyul, Seulgi, Seungyeon, Momo, Lisa and SinB. Seven talented women to place in limited categories on Christmas. Nice. This will be pretty difficult as all these idols are pretty all-rounded. But, nevertheless, I shall try my best hehe. First category: Dance 7. MoonbyulMoonbyul is a great dancer but she is better individually than with her group. She isn\u2019t very versatile but yet she is an amazing dancer and her moves are very smooth yet they can also be sharp. 6. SeulgiThis might be pretty surprising. Yes, Seulgi is an amazing dancer. She has amazing stage presence and good facial expressions. But I feel like her dance skills look \u2018better\u2019 than they actually are because of her stage presence. Her moves are very smooth and she executes dances well, making the choreography look extremely good. 5. LisaLisa. An amazing dancer whose talent is disregarded and thought of to be \u2018overhyped\u2019. I can tell you now that Lisa is an incredible dancer. She has really good stage presence but needs to work a bit more on her facial expression. I think we haven\u2019t seen enough of Lisa\u2019s dancing capability- like the different genres she is able to dance to. We have only seen her skills in one specific genre- hip hop. I don\u2019t know if she can dance to other genres or if it just hasn\u2019t been shown yet but regardless she is incredible at hip hop dancing. 4. SinBI feel like SinB\u2019s dancing is underappreciated. Her facial expressions are sometimes there sometimes not. And her stage presence is a bit weak. But she effortlessly executes each choreography and makes them look much easier than they actually are which might give others the illusion that \u2018the choreography is easy\u2019 when it actually isn\u2019t. 3. SuaCall me biased, I don\u2019t care. Sua\u2019s dancing goes unnoticed so much and it drives me crazy. She is an incredible dancer with outstanding facial expressions and has shown her talent in a variety of genres. She is placed 3rd because the remaining 2 dancers have had a tad more experience and excel a bit more in certain categories. 2. MomoMomo is an incredible dancer. Heck, she was eliminated in \u2018Sixteen\u2019 yet bought back because of her dancing skills, alone. She has had experience since she was a child and shows her talent in a number of genre. She has great stamina and great facial expression. Her stage presence is awesome and she has the talent to captivate the audience, whenever, wherever. 1.SeungyeonSeungyeon is amazing. Absolutely breathtaking. Her dance moves are so smooth and captivating and her stage presence is out of this world. She has incredible facial expressions and really has the power to captivate the audience. Her moves are extremely powerful and strong yet at times they can be elegant and smooth. She really is remarkable. Second category: Rap 7. SeungyeonHaven\u2019t seen a lot from Seungyeon in terms of rapping. Therefore she\u2019s placed last on this list. 6. SeulgiAgain, haven\u2019t seen much from her either. Apart from in Happiness when she rapped for a few milliseconds. 5. SinBSinB is not really an astounding rapper. She\u2019s okay but it seems forced. Rapping isn\u2019t exactly her thing. 4. MomoMomo really has potential to be an amazing rapper. She can spit bars when necessary but JYP hasn\u2019t really been giving her the opportunity. I really hope I can see more from her in the future. 3. SuaSua is a good rapper. She has area where she can improve immensely but she\u2019s pretty decent. I enjoy listening to her rap. 2. LisaLisa is pretty awesome. She has a swaggy aura and voice when she raps. She can occasionally spit some bars too. Pretty good in my opinion. 1.MoonbyulMoonbyul is an amazing rapper. She\u2019s the only one on this list that writes her own raps I think. Her rap flows well with the vocals of her group and her husky, deep voice is unique. For someone who trained to be a vocalist, she is an astounding rapper. Third Category: Vocals 7. MomoMomo is pretty weak when it comes to vocal. Her voice isn\u2019t supported well and sounds very breathy. She also has low stamina when it comes to singing and her voice doesn\u2019t convey any emotions. 6. LisaLisa has a pretty voice. It\u2019s nice to hear and pleasant to the ears. But, again like Momo, her voice isn\u2019t very supported and sometimes sounds breathy. 5. SuaSua\u2019s voice is very nasally and she isn\u2019t using a correct technique. Her voice is supported well either. But she has a likeable voice and it is pleasant to listen to, most of the time. 4. SinBSinB can sing really nicely. Her voice is clear and soothing and nice to listen to. I think her voice is supported well. I don\u2019t really listen to her singing that much though. 3. MoonbyulIf Moonbyul were in another group, she would most likely be a main vocalist. She knows the correct technique\u2019s and has good stamina due to her being trained in vocals. 2. SeungyeonSeungyeon has an attractive voice. It\u2019s powerful and husky and attracts anyone who is listening. She has a likeable voice. She isn\u2019t lead vocalist for nothing. 1.SeulgiOut of all the idols on this list Seulgi has the best vocals. She has the second best vocals in her group. She is an incredible vocalist with amazing vocal tone/colour. She has high stamina and knows how to support her voice properly. She uses correct vocal techniques and is just an incredible vocalist overall. Fourth Category: Visuals This is my personal preference, but I find all of these idols drop-dead gorgeous. 7. Seungyeon  6. Moonbyul  5. SinB  4. Lisa  3. Momo  2. Seulgi  1.Sua  ~k.l ",

            "answer_text": "Today I will be ranking the Main Dancers of some of the best girlgroups this generation has to offer because it seems like a very interesting to do. I\u2019ll try to be as objective as I can because that\u2019s what we all want but feel free to disagree in the comments :) I\u2019m not too familiar with Dreamcatcher so I won\u2019t be putting SuA into this as I can\u2019t really give a full review on her. I\u2019ll add videos for the dance ranking cause y\u2019all know thats the main topic here ;) DANCE 6. Moonbyul  Despite her ranking I still think she is a pretty good dancer, I think she shines more in her solo dances rather than performances with the MAMAMOO members as I even tend to gravitate towards Wheein\u2019s dancing more, but overall she\u2019s still a well enough dancer it\u2019s just the others on this list are too good. 5. Lisa  Lisa\u2019s charisma on-stage is top notch, she also seems like she has a good eye for dancing as proven by her mentorship in Youth with You. I also see a lot of people saying Lisa\u2019s amazing at Hip-Hop which is true but I won\u2019t really say she\u2019s \u201camazing\u201d as there ade even other dancers on this list who can pop & lock better than her but nonetheless she\u2019s still a very good Hip-Hop dancer and I hope she can continue to improve in other fields cause she can be quite stiff in some. 4. SinB  I think SibB is really under appreciated dancing wise just cause her movements don\u2019t look too big but that\u2019s what I think is impressive about her dancing because she doesn\u2019t seem to break a sweat, her movements are so smooth and she is able to make a dance routine look easy which I think really proves that she\u2019s a technically skilled dancer. She also has a background in Hip-Hop and you can see most of it\u2019s influence in her performances. 3. Seulgi  The 7 years of training seems to have helped her have flawless precision and amazing control over her body as seems to know just how much power she needs to put in her movements. Her main field is powerful boy-group dances but she\u2019s still able to do well in other styles which proves her versatility. Her main weakness is her inflexibility which makes her just a tad bit stiff sometimes and she\u2019s naturally clumsy. 2. Momo  The dancing machine herself. She\u2019s proved many times that she can take on any dance routine thrown against her and pull it off perfectly, even Lia Kim said that her dancing skill is a gift from the gods. She can also embody her performances well both through her dancing and her expressions which is the perfect cherry on top. But for me personally her main weakness is actually her biggest strength itself, she seems too \u201ccorrect\u201d sometimes with the choreography so I just don\u2019t feel anything special from her dancing except the acknowledgment that yes she is in fact a very talented dancer. That might just be me tho. Seungyeon Seungyeon is the best female dancer in the current generation there I said it I don\u2019t care cause LOOK AT HER. Her charisma on stage is just amazing and she has that aura and attraction of a very skilled dancer that I just don\u2019t see from Momo. Not to mention her technique and versatility whatever just know that she\u2019s really dope. ______________________________ VOCAL 6. Momo JYP should really stop forcing her with that fake tone cause I\u2019m sorry it just ain\u2019t pleasant to me and I know she can do better cause I\u2019ve watched her singing in Sixteen and it\u2019s not that bad. 5. Lisa Lisa\u2019s more of a rapper who\u2019s learned a thing or two about singing so it\u2019s reasonable that she\u2019s ranked this low. I think she has a nice light tone though and can definitely be better if more polished. 4. Seungyeon As CLC\u2019s Lead Vocalist she has that satisfactory range that does the job well enough to carry the given verses with relative ease. She also has a strong timbre that I really like 3. Moonbyul As a part of MAMAMOO even Moonbyul can be a Lead Vocalist maybe even Main Vocalist in most groups despite her being the least vocally talented member. She has that chesty voice just like her sisters and seems to be trained well enough in singing but because I\u2019ve yet to see more of her singing I decided to place her here. 2. SinB SinB\u2019s actually quite a lovely singer. She has a very pleasant tone and is really stable. Number 2 & 3 are interchangeable depends on how you determine the better singer. SeulgiSeulgi\u2019s two steps or three in singing compared to the other girls so she wins this category fair and square. _________________________ RAP Seulgi and SinB has no business here so let\u2019s just leave it to the other 4 girls 4. Seungyeon I actually have yet to see her do a real rap but since she holds a rapper position in CLC she automatically gets fourth place 3. Momo pInK lAMboRgHiNih. N e ways JYP let Momo rap more ugh I think she really has potential for it and can definitely be better than Dahyun. 2. Lisa I really like Lisa\u2019s flow and her delivery in general but YG keeps on giving her these cringy ass lines and that needs to stop NOW ! 1 . Moonbyul Yeah Moonbyul is the only one who writes her raps here which should just be enough explanation but add that with her great technique. ______________________________ VISUAL -This is purely based on my preference and I still think that all of these ladies are the bomb dot com despite of their ranking.- 6. Moonbyul  5. Momo  4. Lisa  3. Seungyeon  2. SinB  Seulgi That\u2019s it Yee Hee ",

            "answer_text": "Haha, just say you wanna know who the best dancer is. Haha!! Visual SeulgiMomoSinbLisaSuAMoonbyulSeungyeonNothing to explain here, it's just my opinion because visual is obviously subjectif. Vocal SeulgiSinBMoonbyulSuASeungyeonMomoLisaI haven't seen enough of Lisa, as for seulgi, let's be real, she could easily be a main vocalist in 99% of kpop girl group, she may not be able to reach high note but high note isn't the only thing baby. Rap Lisa - I feel emotions when she rapSuA - rap pretty fast and fun to listen toMoonbyul - rap fast too and has this melodies when she rapMomoSinBSeungyeonSeulgiDance MomoShe has great facial expressions and balance, she knows how to attract people's eyes with her natural charm and stage presence. Momo has been dancing since she was 3 years old and has strengthen her foundation to the point that's almost flawless. But what is a foundation? It's the thing that allows you to grow as a dancer.. A dancer trying to become a great dancer without or little foundation is like trying to build a house without foundation, it won't work. The stronger your foundation, the stronger a dancer can be. which is why your foundation are the most important aspect of dance. Her only significant weaknesses is that she is a chronic overdancer and she can be a bit stiff at genres she is never done before, which is normal considering she never did them. But again, quality of dance over quantity of dance. 2. Seungyeon Seungyeon \u2018s greatest strengths is her outstanding charisma, her moves are full of power and her technique is amazing, she is consistent and is very versatile. Her weakness is that she also tends to overdance as well. Also I strongly and ultimately believed her foundation of dance is just not as good as no 1. 3. SinB Sinb is exceptionally good at hip-hop. She has a solid foundation of dance which means dancing to hip-hop feels truly easy for her. Her moves are powerful and she does have a facial. Overall, her dancing is amazing. Sinb was also trained since she was a kid if I remember correctly. 4. Lisa Lisa is also very good at hip-hop. Lisa was trained before she was a trainee and her dancing is also amazing!!! She may not be the most versatile dancer but again, quality over quantity, always. Although, she can't freestyle and choreograph unlike the one above, I honestly don't know what that has to do with dancing because as far as I know most pro dancer can't choreograph. Sure they can freestyle but freestyle is freestyle and dance is dance. Each has it's different technique. Lisa is also prone to overdance as well. 5. Seulgi Her strength are her great charisma, isolation, facial expression, stamina, consistency, good techniques and clean moves. Seulgi isn't that flexible and flexibility is very important in dancing, and her clumsiness means that she is the most likely one to stumble or lose balance and then her moves will not be as clean. Also, Seulgi and pretty much most SM MAIN DANCER for whatever reason can be extremely stiff at some genres, I've noticed. Again, I believe that even if you are only good at one specific dance style, you can still be the best dancer but that's still to be considered in one's overall dancing abilities and unfortunately her strength are not as big as the other above her. 6. SuA 7. Moonbyul They are good but I haven't seen much from those 2 sorry. I hope that you've enjoyed my list ",

            "answer_text": "This is difficult but I\u2019ll try my best. These will be based of personal preference and don\u2019t take the visuals one too seriously. Dance Seungyeon - She deserves more attention for her dancing, her charisma and talent is crazy. You might not even be looking at her during a CLC performance but you\u2019ll know she\u2019s there.Momo - I love watching her perform on stage, I do think she does look a bit tired nowadays which isn\u2019t surprising considering how hard Twice work. Her performances on Sixteen impressed me.Seulgi - She makes herself look powerful and is slick too.SuA - When she performs, it\u2019s like she\u2019s commanding you to watch her. I think she\u2019s definitely one of the best dancers in her group.Lisa - Whilst I really like watching Lisa perform, I do think her dances often have similar moves which don\u2019t always show off her talent. I do think her facial expressions have improved though.SinB - A fantastic dancer although she sometimes lacks facial expressions. Her moves are very controlled too.Moonbyul - She can dance but I think she looks better without choreography.Rap Moonbyul - Undoubtedly one of the best female rappers of the 3rd generation. She has excellent flow, her raps in songs such as \u2018Waggy\u2019, \u2018Hip\u2019 and even \u2018Destiny\u2019 prove this.Lisa - She has a lot of sass in her raps, especially in songs like \u2018Boombayah\u2019 and \u2018How You Like That\u2019.SuA - I think she has improved but I know there\u2019s still more to come in the future.Momo - If she was given more oppourtunities to showcase her skills, she would do well.Seungyeon - I did think she was a rapper but I\u2019ve only heard her rap once.Seulgi - I\u2019ve never really heard her rap.SinB - GFriend isn\u2019t a group that focuses on rapping or raps in general.Vocals Seulgi - I love her voice. Even in her solo songs such as \u2018Don\u2019t Forget\u2019, she has proved her talent.Seungyeon - Whilst she may not have the best voice out of the members of CLC, her voice is still good. Songs such as \u2018No\u2019, \u2018Hobgoblin\u2019 and \u2018Helicopter\u2019 have shown this.Moonbyul - The evolution of her voice from debut up until now is so impressive. The song \u2018Eclipse\u2019 just emphasises this and I love how deep her voice is.SuA - I like her voice.SinB - Same thing as SuA.Lisa - She is definitely more of a rapper than a singer but she has a nice voice.Momo - Honestly, I wish JYPE didn\u2019t make her use the tone of voice she\u2019s using now. It\u2019s not great but I still think she can sing.Visuals (your ranking will differ) 1.Seulgi  2. Seungyeon  3. Moonbyul  4. SuA  5. Momo  6. SinB  7. Lisa  \ud83d\ude42\u2728 ",

            "answer_text": "I mean, I can try. It\u2019s going to be hard in dance, though. Before I get started, here\u2019s a bias ranking: SuaSeulgiSeungyeonMomoLisaMoonbyulSinBDance: Seungyeon - a whole legend. Confident and talented. She has amazing technique and control and she often choreographs her own dances. She\u2019s also capable of adapting to so many different concepts and styles of dance.Momo - a very, very close second. She doesn\u2019t have a chance to showcase her full ability because of Twice\u2019s limited choreography, but she\u2019s definitely capable of so much. She also doesn\u2019t show her choreographies very often.Sua - a close third, but she\u2019s less versatile in how she adapts to other concepts. The rest of Seungyeon and Momo\u2019s criteria applies, though. Here\u2019s a video of Sua attempting to do a cute concept because I love her.Seulgi - holy shit she is good. Again, same criteria above applies except for one point: I cannot find any of her own choreographies.Lisa - her hip-hop skills are amazing, and she\u2019s by far the best hip-hop dancer of these seven, but beyond that she lacks some diversity. I also don\u2019t know that she can choreograph, but that\u2019s becoming more common the lower we go.SinB - by no means a bad dancer but she seems kinda underwhelming recently when compared with her predebut content. This may have something to do with her height or the dances she\u2019s given, but she definitely shines more with stronger choreographies.Moonbyul - no hate intended towards her, but I have no idea how she managed to become Mamamoo\u2019s main dancer when she\u2019s by far the weakest. She\u2019s good at freestyling, but she\u2019s very stiff.Rap Moonbyul - the only lyricist and rapper of these, so she\u2019s got no contest.Lisa - good rapper, good flow, but not a lyricist.Sua - less experience than Lisa (promoted more as a dancer & vocalist than a rapper) but also has good flow. I prefer her voice, though.Momo - doesn\u2019t get anywhere near enough rap parts, unfortunately, but she\u2019s good too.Seulgi, Seungyeon, and SinB - not rappers.Vocal Seulgi - no question about it. Definite main vocal material for most groups.Sua - although she strains sometimes, she has a great voice & good technique. Her main issue is that she doesn\u2019t have a well developed head voice.Seungyeon - her voice is so beautiful and I love how she has a developed lower range rather than forcing herself to be a soprano.Moonbyul - another deep voice that\u2019s really pleasing. She\u2019s not very dynamic but considering she stopped training as a vocalist to become a rapper, she\u2019s quite good.SinB - very delicate voice, gets nasal when she goes high and doesn\u2019t have a supported lower range. Has a lot of potential, though, and would be significantly better had she trained somewhere other than BigHit.Lisa & Momo - it\u2019s hard to tell which one of these two is a better singer because they have so little content. Lisa has a beautiful voice but she rarely shows it without the strange technique forced on Blackpink members (only reference is a few clips from livestreams) and therefore her actual vocal ability can\u2019t be judged. Momo is a good singer, although she\u2019s naturally very nasal; however, she\u2019s made to sing soprano parts when she\u2019s an alto and doesn\u2019t sound particularly good because of that.Not doing visuals because that\u2019s wholly subjective!
