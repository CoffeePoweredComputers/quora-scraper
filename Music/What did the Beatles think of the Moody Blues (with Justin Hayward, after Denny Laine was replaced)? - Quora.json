            "answer_text": "I have not read any interview with any member of the Beatles mentioning the Moody Blues 1967 onward. The Beatles were well established by then (hence, the Moodies were not a \u201cthreat\u201d) and having reached their peak, were splitting when the Moodies were really peaking in 68-72, so the members of The Beatles probably had other things to think about. The Beatles were no longer touring (as the Moodies and the Beatles did in 65) so I am not aware of any close contact from 1967 onward either. So, sorry, no info , unless someone else knows something.

            "answer_text": "That's a bit like asking, what did The Rolling Stones think of Doctor Who when Verity Lambert stopped producing it? How are we supposed to know. What's the likelihood that each member of the Stones has commented on this in an interview? About as likely that each member of The Beatles would have commented on what they thought of The Moody Blues, with Justin Haywood, after Denny Laine was replaced. ",
