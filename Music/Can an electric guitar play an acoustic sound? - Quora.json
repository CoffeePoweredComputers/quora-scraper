            "answer_text": "There are couple of choices you can dive into if you want to SIMULATE an acoustic sound but none of this will truly REPLICATE the sound and richness of acoustic guitar. 1. EQ pedal: Yes, you are probably shocked but an Equalizer pedal is built for you to mess around with the frequency output of the electric guitar. An Acoustic guitar sound has a more low end frequency output, a subtle amount of mids and treble. Just experiment with those tiny sliders until you find the acoustic sound you want.2. D.I. Box and Home Stereo System. Like number one, home stereo systems have an equalizer for you to mess with (some even have separate for left and right channels). The D.I. Box is there to provide consistency of signal flow from your guitar to the microphone input (thats your entrance gate to the home stereo) to cancel the annoying effect of impedance miss match.3. Acoustic guitar simulator pedals.This is the most worry free of all the choices. Just plug and play. If you desire you can adjust the settings for presence, top, and even emulate the sound of 12 stringed guitar. They come on stompbox form or as a preset patch on most multi effects guitar processors.4. Piezo Pickup.Like our quoran friends here suggests, a piezo pickup can nearly simulate the acoustic sound your are looking for. Just a piece of advice, do not install it DIRECTLY the metal bridge. Keep several millimeters away from bridge and attach it to the wood. I would say, it in most effective if your guitar is a hollow body..... Hope all this will help you... ",

            "answer_text": "A Godin LGX (SA) guitar has a piezo transducer and can play an \u2018acoustic\u2019 sound, in the sense that the sound coming from a piezo transducer on an acoustic guitar is \u2018acoustic\u2019. It is never quite the same as an acoustic guitar. Played through a Roland VG-99, you can get a very good acoustic sound from the Godin\u2019s GK pickup, or you can fit a Roland GK pickup to almost any guitar. This is through guitar modelling. This will generally produce a better acoustic sound on stage than an acoustic guitar would fitted with a piezo transducer. If you want to do this, you need to set up your Godin carefully, with a slightly higher action than you would normally take and with minimum .010 string gauge. Otherwise, even though the sound can model an acoustic guitar, the response of the guitar will be wrong. When setting up the VG-99, you need to turn down the gain on the strings to about 20, instead of around 70 which is more usual. Otherwise they will clip on the highest resonance, as an electric guitar does, and the illusion is lost. I learned to do this via VGuitar forums, http://vguitarforums.com. Before I turned down the gain, I was getting an acousticish but not really authentic sound. If you want to get an acoustic sound from an amplified acoustic guitar via its piezo transducer, then consider getting a Fishman Aura or equivalent. The Aura processes the transducer sound to be much more like the original guitar sound. Some people say it\u2019s good enough for the studio, though I don\u2019t agree, but it does sound extremely authentic live. ",

            "answer_text": "The original question was whether one can play acoustic guitar songs on an electric guitar, which has nothing to do with the question with which it has been thoughtlessly merged. One can certainly play acoustic guitar songs on an electric guitar. It won\u2019t sound quite the same but tweaking tone controls, etc., can bring it close. More importantly, however, is that the essence of a song is quite malleable. Cover bands regularly walk onto a stage and play a variety of songs originally played by a wide range of artists. Each of those songs was originally recorded with one or more specific types of guitars, specific amplifiers, equalization, effects pedals, studio wizardry, etc. and yet many a cover band guitar player will walk in with their favorite guitar and amp, plug in, set the controls to their favorite setting, and proceed to play every song without changing a thing \u2014 perhaps they might add an effects pedal here or there, or choose a different pickup, etc., but that\u2019s about as far as they go to remain faithful to the original. And yet, few in the audience will be the wiser, and even those who do recognize the variance from the original likely won\u2019t care. Playing an acoustic guitar song on an electric guitar? Piece of cake. ",

It does sounds pretty close to a pickup recorded acoustic guitar (about the half of the video).  Powerbridge | Fishman Not cheap, but pretty convincing. You could even improve the sound with a pedal like this.  A Fishman Aura, or even a TC-Electronics Body Rez would do. But this way you end paying more than the cost of a middle range acoustic :-) The other way is using an electric guitar with an acoustic modeling pedal.  Perhaps not so accurate but far cheaper :-) even with a cheapo clone like this one I\u2019m using (20$ in a chinese e-shop):  Keep in mind your amp will colour the sound too, you need a very clean channel to sound \u201cacoustic\u201d.

I\u2019ve found that it has a plausible acoustic sound with the right amp settings (meaning, generally, clean, neutral EQ and no distortion). You can play acoustic songs that would resemble playing them on a real acoustic to an extent. You won\u2019t fool anyone and this won\u2019t fly in an \u201cacoustics only\u201d venue. I believe the guitar was made for that era of sounds that started off acoustic, went electric, then full distortion, then electric then ended acoustically. It\u2019s credible enough that you could get away with not having an acoustic on a stand to play the acoustic parts of such songs. It\u2019s not a substitute for when you want a full acoustic guitar sound. ",

They cannot make acoustic guitar sounds - at least not those that are typical of popular acoustic guitars (e.g., Martin and Taylor). Bob Dylan could not sing Chimes of Freedom with an electric guitar and piezo and sound like Bob Dylan. Same with Bruce Springsteen and State Trooper. The instruments are just too differently designed. ",

A Roland pickup is hexophonic\u2014six pickups in one to get the sound of each string separately. This facilitates more accurate modeling (as well as individual string pitch shifting and panning and other cool stuff). I play a solid-body Godin LGX-SA through a Roland VG=99 and a Roland GR-55. These (among many other things) both model various types of acoustic guitars. The result is okay\u2014but nobody is going to think you\u2019re playing a vintage Martin. Line Six used to make a line of \u201cVariax\u201d electric guitars that did internal modeling. They can sound pretty good. ",
