            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t hate BTS but I hate their fans. Not all of them of course, I\u2019ve met so many amazing Army\u2019s but the majority of their fans aren\u2019t very nice. They can be cocky and think their fandom is the best. They even assumed anyone who likes or shows interest in kpop to be an Army. They can be self-centered. I know BTS told you to love yourself but please remember to love other people as well. They look down on other fandom. I tried to help out (nicely by the way) of a disagreement between some Armys but they told me that it\u2019s none of my concern. when I said I was just trying to help they said no need. If I was using a bts fan account when I tried to \u201chelp out\u201d I\u2019m sure the results would be different. It disgusts me at how this person treated me just because I\u2019m from a different fandom. They can be selfish and only cared about their happiness. A friend of mine, yes a friend, she said she\u2019s mad at people who buys bts ticket when they don\u2019t even like bts. It\u2019s true that those tickets would be better use for those who actually liked them but they did paid for those tickets? Then I asked, if I were to buy a bts ticket, would she allow it? and she said no. What pissed me off even more was that she told me she went to so many concerts of artists that she didn\u2019t even like. Such a hypocrite. Armys also never want to admit their flaws and faults. Someone commented something about BTS, the wording could be better to avoid \u201cmisunderstandings\u201d, actually it\u2019s not a misunderstanding, most Armys are just sensitive. So someone commented something that didn\u2019t really diss bts but not very nice things either but they are facts and Armys went and attacked this person\u2019s fandom and kpop group. I feel like people have to watch every word they say about BTS or Armys while Armys can spread their dirty mouths and talk shit and get away with it. They just don\u2019t take criticism very well. They can be very judgemental. They criticise people and judge every action and compare it to bts. They would say ooo bts is better , ahh they don\u2019t deserve it bla bla bla\u2026 Most Armys also don\u2019t know the struggle. It\u2019s obviously not a secret that bts has lots of fans and they easily win awards. New Armys especially don\u2019t understand the struggle. The group I stan just won an award which was a pretty big deal for the fandom and we worked so hard for it, I can\u2019t express in words of the hardship we went through. I wanted to share with my friends of how proud I am and that my hardwork paid off but they just simly said that it\u2019s not import and like they don\u2019t care at all. If I do the same think as that, I would be avoided by these friends.. *sigh* Armys worship bts so much they look down at other artists. This person posted a video of her pushing away/throwing away a HS album with her love yourself album saying that HS didn\u2019t get nominated for the Grammys bla bla bla. A lot of Armys know and agreed that this is wrong and I\u2019m glad that they are still sane and humanity but what disappoints me was that the video had over a thousand rts and 7000+ likes. That\u2019s really sad of how the world thinks. It\u2019s really disrespectful of other people\u2019s hardwork. A few Armys were even defending the person saying she bought the albums she can do whatever she wants,Armys also can\u2019t take jokes :/ These are some of my complaints\u2026 I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll be making a book if I don\u2019t stop now. Now please understand that this does not apply to all Armys and that I\u2019m not attacking the good people. Just the shitty immature ones and if you feel offended then maybe you are one of them and you just gotta deal with it because your fandom cannot always defend you for your faults. I love bts and their songs really but I\u2019m scared of what I\u2019ll become if I join the fandom so I try to get as far away from it as possible. I speak from my own experience so you can\u2019t say that I\u2019m wrong and saying bullshit. Of course these are just the ugly facts, there are good facts out there. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m gonna be highly biased here. The reason why people hate armys are because those people are seeing only the bad side of armys. And to other armys who are \u201cashamed\u201d of calling themselves armys, please I wish I will never meet you. Ok so, we all know army is a BIG fandom. And by BIG I mean BIG big. We can\u2019t control millions of people, can we? That should be enough to answer your question, I think? But let me write other things as well. People follow other people they WANT to see on the internet, right? If you follow people who hate armys, then what you\u2019re seeing will be the bad side (which actually every fandom has) of the armys. And if you\u2019re following people who don\u2019t care about toxicity and only want to spread positiveness, then that will be what you\u2019re seeing. Easy. Now, some people said \u201carmys are everywhere and it\u2019s annoying\u201d. Like I said, a big fandom with millions of people who have different personalities from around the world. How can you control all of them? We, armys, are keep trying to reduce the toxic, the annoying people in our fandom. But it takes time. BTS is getting more and more fans these past few years, and some of them knew nothing about Kpop. If they only like BTS\u2019 music and not the entire kpop industry, are they wrong? No. People have different taste of music, if they like BTS\u2019 music only, then that\u2019s their choice. If they like other groups\u2019 music, then that\u2019s also their choice. Liking BTS doesn\u2019t mean we have to know about everything about Kpop, right? I don\u2019t see any other reasons why people hate armys aside from \u201cthey\u2019re everywhere, toxic, annoying\u201d yada yada yada. Maybe if those people step aside and see what most armys see then they would understand. And last thing, people always say \u201carmys are toxic, not all of them but MOST of them.\u201d Let me laugh. How do those people know that MOST of armys are toxic, I wonder. Did they did a survey? Have they met all of armys? That sentence is wrong, it should be \u201cmost armys THAT I MET are annoying.\u201d then, the answer is back to my point above. You follow what you want to see. I hope this helps answer your question! And I\u2019m sorry if there\u2019s grammar mistakes. ",
