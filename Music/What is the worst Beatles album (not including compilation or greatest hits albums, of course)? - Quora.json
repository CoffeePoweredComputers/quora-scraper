            "answer_text": "Fun question \u2014 thanks for the A2A. It highlights an old split in Beatles fans, reflected by their first two \u201cgreatest hits\u201d albums. In high school my friend and I were fans, but he liked the Red album (their earlier stuff, through Rubber Soul if I recall), and I liked the Blue album (the later stuff). While I have come to appreciate the earlier music, I still think this split is useful, and I think there must be two answers to your question. I don\u2019t know the first four albums well enough to say one is the worst, but I expect a lot of people would pick one of them (not later \u2014 Rubber Soul, Hard Day\u2019s Night or Revolver \u2014 though!). Whichever that is, call it the Worst Red Album. I would call Let It Be the Worst Blue Album. It has some really good songs on it, but then, they didn\u2019t make many bad ones. It has a mish-mash feeling to me, partly because they were off doing their own thing (which did not ruin the white album), but probably also because they brought in a new producer for (I think) the first time. Phil Spector has produced some awesome music, but I don\u2019t think he and the Beatles ever figured out how to mesh their very distinct visions. Spector was famous for spending ages in the studio, and I don\u2019t think the Beatles wanted to spend much more time with one another, let alone a new visionary/megalomaniac. [Trivia: Let It Be is not the last album they made. They pulled together to make Abbey Road before they called it quits, but legal problems (I think around the related movie) held Let It Be up.] I like Ian\u2019s answer (Pete Best\u2019s \u201cBest of the Beatles\u201d) \u2014 never knew about that one :).

            "answer_text": "  Help! is the worst real Beatles album for me, if I don\u2019t count Yellow Submarine, which is much, much, much worse (though it has a pair of excellent songs.) It\u2019s kind of half a compilation or\u2026whatever it is, Yellow Submarine\u2019s a mess. While songs like \u201cTicket to Ride\u201d, Help!\u201d \u201cYesterday\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve Just Seen a Face\u201d are nothing short of sublime, and \u201cYou\u2019re Going to Lose that Girl\u201d is an all right throwback, the rest of the songs are mediocre at best and dull and flat at worst. You\u2019ve also got \u201cYou\u2019ve Got to Hide Your Love Away\u201d, a cutesy Dylan pastiche saved only by the amazing vocal. Otherwise, you have some very dull McCartney rockers (\u201cThe Night Before\u201d and \u201cAnother Girl\u201d); a pair of flat listless Harrison pop songs (\u201cYou Like Me Too Much\u201d seems particularly phoned in) a boring country rock song (\u201cAct Naturally\u201d\u2014 they would do the same sort of thing much better on Rubber Soul\u2019s \u201cWhat Goes On\") an embarrasingly silly pop song \u201cTell Me What You See.\u201d And an OK Roy Orbison impersonation in \u201cIt\u2019s Only Love.\u201d And then \u201cDizzy Miss Lizzy\u201d which is just \u2014 I mean, yes, it rocks, but at that point the Lennon\u2019s Larry Williams thing was getting old. The vocal is ridiculously inappropriate and \u201chard rock\u201d; I feel that all the sex inherent in the song has been shouted out of it \u2014 \u201cSlow Down\u201d it ain\u2019t. As always with the Beatles, the songs I\u2019m not keen on all have some good things going for them: McCartney\u2019s gnarly guitar in \u201cAnother Girl\", the enthusiasm of \u201cThe Night Before\u201d, the drumming and rhythm guitar of \u201cI Need You.\u201d But I think it would have been a far greater better album had they included the B-sides of the era (especially \u201cI\u2019m Down\u201d) and shaved a couple of songs off. Clearly a year and a half of mega-fame, a massive global tour, the filming of two movies and the writing and recording of three albums was wearing them thin. They bounced back with Rubber Soul at the very end of that year. ",

            "answer_text": "Being in the UK some of the earlier albums had different listings to those released in the US, but out of the UK releases the worst one was Beatles For Sale just edging out Yellow Submarine. This is because in my opinion the latter is only half a Beatles album with exception of the title they weren\u2019t bad. Back to Beatles For Sale, all of the cover versions with may be the exception of Rock n Roll Music, could be dropped. They are some of their poorer renditions they made. That leaves 9 out of 14 tracks. The outstanding track is \u201cEight Days A Week\u201d although not a single release in the UK. I quite like \u201cNo Reply\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m A Loser\u201d but that\u2019s probably as my mum bought the first EP with these tracks on and played it to death. Parlophone released 2 EP\u2019s from this album, the expression flogging a dead horse comes to mind. Of the rest I am pushed to recall what they are like apart from \u201cI\u2019ll Follow The Sun\u201d, quite a pleasant track, and \u201cBaby\u2019s In Black\u201d, which sounds like it should have been on \u201cWith The Beatles\u201d, but its okay. Just played the other songs just in case I missed any gems.The only I played all the way through was \u201cWhat You\u2019re Doing\u201d, okay but hardly memorable. Sometimes the Beatles would not include their single releases onto albums as they felt that the album was strong enough. A bad call in this case where \u201cI Feel Fine\u201d and the B side \u201cShe\u2019s A Woman\u201d would have enhanced it considerably. ",

The \u201cworst\u201d Beatles album is clearly Yellow Submarine, not because anything on it is necessarily artistically bad, but because it offers only four previously unreleased Beatles songs\u2014all of them leftovers. One of these leftovers (\u201cHey Bulldog\u201d) is a minor masterpiece, of course, but as a whole, the album is the only one that doesn\u2019t give terrific value for money. Lance\u2019s answer argues that it doesn\u2019t count, and I suppose you can argue that if you like, but it totally does. It\u2019s one of the basic discs you need to complete their core catalog. ",
