As RHCP were already an established act with a particular sound, DN was acting as a standin for Frusciante, who was overwhelmed by the successof it all (read as in rehab or needing it).  The arraignment was temporarily and since the one albumn DN was on was not a massive success like Blood sugar sex magic was, there was also likely alot if blame and finger pointing.  So Dave got summarily fired. ",
