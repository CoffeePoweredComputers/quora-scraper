            "answer_text": "To be profitable, a movie needs to have still earned money across all revenue channels after the exhibitor/retailer/broadcaster/streamer\u2019s cut, distribution expenses, marketing expenses, production expenses, financing expenses, other expenses, and points negotiated by any of the above-the-line members of the production (actors, screenwriter, director, etc.). Most films are not profitable \u2014 at least, not after their initial box office runs \u2014 because of all the expenses and companies/people who receive a percentage of the revenue as payment for their services. This doesn\u2019t mean that production companies, studios, distributors and exhibitors lose money on unprofitable films \u2014 they get paid out of the fees they charge and percentages of gross revenues. Any profit (net revenues) is just gravy. ",

            "answer_text": "Each movie will be different. It depends on the production costs, the advertising and marketing costs, the percentage of box office receipts the distributing studio has negotiated with exhibitors, and of course who you are referring to when you say \u201cprofitable\u201d. A movie can be \u201cprofitable\u201d for say, the exhibitors, but not the studio, or the other way around. The distributor might make a profit, but not the production companies that funded the picture. And so on\u2026 ",
