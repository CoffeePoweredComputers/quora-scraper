            "answer_text": "Protools and FL studio are both DAW (digital audio workstation) pieces of software, but both with very different intended users.  Pro tools is squarely aimed at the recording, editing and mixing of audio. It is used in recording studios to record bands, orchestras and anything that requires multiple inputs. It has the most powerful and quickest editing features of any piece of audio software. It also handles video and time code very well so is popular for post production and mixing for films/TV. It can be used for sequencing and sound design but its primary use is for audio recording and mixing.  FL studio on the other hand is designed really as a sequencer. It's very intuitive and quick to program midi sequences with, and is popular for sound design and synthesis, coming with powerful instruments and effects. It is designed much more for the producer/composer and is very quick to sketch out song ideas in. It can be used to record and edit audio but its primary use is as a sequencer.  If you had to pick the average Protools user it would probably be a sound engineer in some sort of studio recording or mixing audio files, who does very little sequencing.  If you had to pick the average FL studio user it would probably be someone writing music (probably dance music using software synthesisers) who does very little actual audio recording beyond maybe a vocal or a guitar.  Both pieces of software share a lot of the same features and that's not to say you can't sequence with Protools or record multi channel audio with FL studio, but that's not their primary purpose or what they are commonly used for.

Both can have multiple Plug-Ins, but only on PT can you actually move the Plugins outside of its window, compared to FL.There\u2019s more control about what you want compared to PT. You also have more plug-ins that are just for (or better with) FL than PT, although that\u2019s only what I\u2019ve seen. -There is a vast majority of likability on FL compared to PT given how easy it is to make music (and use) on FL (you can too on PT, it\u2019s been done for all genre), but it\u2019s not beginner friendly as I\u2019ll explain more on this list.FL is more often used to make music than anything else. There are about 100 different people teaching FL lessons than PT about how to make a drop on a dubstep song; how to do automation; how to sidechain; how to do almost anything.PT actually wants you to learn it through a paid course or a paid textbook\u2026 so you could get a legit certificate saying you know what you\u2019re doing, so that\u2019s something to pay for. -But that can only get you so far as more and more DAWs (Digital Audio Workstation) are doing things much easier or have already been doing it better for so long and have made things easier for others. Point is, while you might pay $100+ on the certification, the same amount of time can be used on another much easier DAW that you might like more. Your time, your money, your choice on what you think you should go with, but don\u2019t be afraid on which one you choose since they each have their own niche community that are always happy to help, regardless of what you\u2019ve chosen.PT is more industrious, meaning on higher corporate jobs, PT is used more often because it\u2019s on Mac as well, a very well used computer for business-like companies; since it has less of a chance to crash compared to FL (and FL isn\u2019t on Mac as far as I remember) -While yes, this is true, so are other DAWs that industry don\u2019t care about audio, so they get whatever, but if you\u2019re learning, PT as a beginner lets you learn how any and all other DAWs work, well\u2026 at least for me, but again, if you use your skill on one DAW, you should be able to work on almost all of them, just knowing where to find what.~PT is actually much better at editing than FL since it\u2019s more precise than FL, and it can be with a lot of more stronger audio interfaces than FL (that are known to handle more mics)So now that I\u2019ve updated this, what have I chosen? Well, that\u2019s the thing, I\u2019m still using PT for my edits since it has a feature called \u201cOffline Mode\u201d when I render/export the audio which increases the speed of which it finishes. Normally (ex. PT9) you\u2019d have to wait for the ENTIRE song to be played back, which is tedious when you\u2019re just trying to get back to editing. A 1 hour song would have to render 1 hour, but with the more recent versions (ex. PT10+), the Offline Mode allows for faster renders going as fast as 40x render speed. I\u2019m not sure what it uses exactly, but I sure love it when I have to wait like 1 minute and 30 seconds instead of 1 hour to get back to editing. As for FL? Well, I\u2019ve had some Plugins saved for the longest time and can be better used on FL than what PT. FL also has more plugins that come with it than PT has, which makes things better if you want to change things up on a song. That being said, most producers don\u2019t use stock as the better ones are the ones you buy (look up videos/tutorials about this) can give you a much better \u201cbang for your buck\u201d Once again, they\u2019re two different DAWs that can be used for two difference reasons of which they both excel at. You can use both like their counterpart exactly the same way, but that\u2019s not why they were made for, so feel free to give both a try as that\u2019s what I did and I have no regretted it\u2026 now\u2026 time to try out more DAWs since I have the actual money to do it ;) A\u0336g\u0336a\u0336i\u0336n\u0336,\u0336 \u0336t\u0336h\u0336e\u0336s\u0336e\u0336 \u0336a\u0336r\u0336e\u0336
